JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PLCA)

Learned counsel for all the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-07-11

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of written

submissions. Therefore, this judgment would be based on the material that

the parties have so adduced before this Court.

The Commissioner of labour had instituted proceedings against Rubberite

Limited in the Magistrate's Court of Negombo in terms of section 7 of the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No 45 of

1971 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) as the said company had failed to

pay the compensation awarded to the employees for the unlawful

termination of their services following the closure of the said company on

12th June 1989.

Learned Magistrate by his order dated 1998-05-22 had sentenced the 3rd

Accused Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) to a

term of 06 months RI suspended for a period of 10 years and also to a fine

of Rs. 6,736610.00 to be paid jOintly and severally with the other accused.

A default sentence of 02 years RI was also imposed.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court seeking a

revision of the said order pronounced by the Magistrate. Learned Provincial

High Court Judge by his judgement dated 2004-12-01 had dismissed the

said application. The Appellant has lodged the instant appeal against that

judgment.

'. 5

Section 9 (a) of the act provides "if the body of persons is a body

corporate, every director and officer of that body corporate shall be

deemed to be guilty of that offence."

It is clear that the Appellant had been charged in this case in his capacity

as a director of the accused company in terms of section 9 of the Act.

It is the position of the Appellant that he had ceased to be a director of the

relevant company from 1985-05-12. He had relied on the documents

produced marked 3V 6 and 3V 7.

However, the learned Magistrate had taken the view that the Appellant had

not satisfied Court that the Petitioner had duly resigned from the Board of

Directors at the relevant time.

It is to be noted that the learned Magistrate had gone on the basis that the

Appellant had not called any evidence to establish that his letter of

resignation produced marked 3V 6 had indeed sent or handed over to the

relevant company. It is on that basis that the learned Magistrate had

convicted the Appellant.

According to the charge sheet, it is the following charge that has been

framed against the accused in the instant case.

" ... You, the Rubberite Limited, being an employer of workmen employed

in a scheduled employment under the name and style of Rubberite Limited

situated at Kotugeda, Jaela within the jurisdiction of this Court, had failed

to comply with the order of the Commissioner of Labour, bearing No.

TEUC/41/89 dated 1 (Jh day of September, 1990 issued to you by the said

Commissioner of Labour under the powers vested in him under section 6

(A) (1) of the Termination of Employment of workmen (Special Provisions)

Act No. 45 of 1971 as amended by the Acts No.4 of 1976.and 51 of 1988

directing you to pay on or about 01st day of October, 1990 to the workers

named in the schedule annexed hereto the amounts indicated against each

of the workers totaling a sum of Rs. 6,736,610/= and thus you have

committed an offence punishable under section 7 read with section 8 of the

aforesaid Act (as amended) No. 45 of 1971. ... "

Thus, the alleged offence according to the charge shall be taken as having

been committed during the time period from 1990-09-10 to 1990-10-01.

Question to be decided in this case is whether the 3rd accused in the case

has remained as a director during that period.

It is the position of the 3rd accused that he had resigned with effect from

1989-05-12 by virtue of the letter marked 3 V 7, which is a letter of

resignation. The 3rd accused states that the said letter was duly

communicated to the office of Rubberite Limited and also to the Registrar

of Companies.

It is the position of the Respondents that the 3rd accused had failed to

prove this fact to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate. Thus, it would

be necessary to look at the evidence pertaining to the said issue.

Perusal of the evidence of the witness Duwanage Nihal Ranjith

Siriwardhana called to give evidence on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd accused

had produced relevant documents pertaining to the details of directors.

The documents produced marked 3 V 1 , 3 V 2 , 3 V 3 , 3 V 4 , 3 V 6 ,

and 3 V 7 clearly establish that the 3rd accused had resigned from the post

of Director of this company with effect from 1989-05-12.

,

It must be borne in mind that the Appellant had been appointed to the

board of directors of Rubberite Limited by the DFCC Bank as per its right to

appoint a nominee director to the board of Rubberite Limited as per a

clause in the loan agreement. (DFCC Bank had given a loan to Rubberite

Limited). It is amply clear from the document marked 3 V 6 that the DFCC

Bank had withdrawn its nominee Director (Appellant was the nominee

Director at that time) from the Board of Directors of Rubberite Limited with

effect from 1989-05-12. It is with that letter sent by the DFCC Bank, the

letter of resignation of the Appellant marked 3 V 7 had been forwarded to

the Rubberite Limited.

The above evidence clearly establish that the Appellant had not functioned

as a director of Rubberite Limited between the time period from 1990-09-

10 to 1990-10-01. Thus, the Appellant cannot be held liable for the above

offence. Learned Magistrate has failed to appreciate the above facts in his

judgment. That appears to have led to the conviction of the Appellant.

The learned Provincial High Court Judge also has missed the said points

and hence has erred when it decided to uphold the conviction of the

Appellant.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to set aside the judgment dated

1998-05-22 of the learned Magistrate and the judgment dated 2004-12-01

of the learned Provincial High Court Judge. This Court directs that the

Appellant be acquitted and discharged from the charge framed against

him.

Appeal is allowed.
