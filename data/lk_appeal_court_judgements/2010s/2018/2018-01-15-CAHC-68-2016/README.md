s. Thurairaia, P.C, J

Accused Appellant is present in Court, produced by the Prison Authorities.

Counsel for the Accused Appellant moves to withdraw the appeal.

The Accused Appellant who is present in Court also confirms, that he wants to

withdraw the appeal. The Counsel for the Accused Appellant pleads with the

Court, that the Accused Appellant is in remand from the date of conviction.

Therefore, he wants the sentence to be implemented from the date of

conviction.

The Deputy Solicitor General who is present in Court has no objections to

implement the sentence from the date of conviction, on the basis that he is

incarcerated from the date of conviction.

Considering the submissions of both Counsels the Court allows the Accused

Appellant to withdraw the appeal.

..

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We direct the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from the date of

conviction namely, 31.05.2016 because he was in remand from that date.

Appeal dismissed.
