*************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"Appellant") invokes appellate jurisdiction of this Court, seeking to set

aside the order dated 05.12.2014 pronounced by the Provincial High Court

holden in Kandy in Case No. Rev /13/11 by which it has allowed an

application for revision by the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent").

The Appellant has made an application for an order of eviction

under Section 5(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of

1979 as amended against the Respondent, in respect of four blocks of State

2

land described in the schedule. Learned Magistrate after an inquiry has

issued an order of eviction against the Respondent on 11.02.2011.

Thereafter, the Respondent sought to revise the said order of

eviction on the basis that the description of the boundaries in respect of the

block of State land described as lot No.3 depicted in the plan No. 3595 by

Superintendent of Surveys A.L.S. Kobewatta of 24.09.1989 in the

application to Court conflicts with the description of the same land in the

quit notice issued on him.

In his objection to the application, the Appellant clearly stated that

the disparity in the description was the result of an error which had crept

in through the certified copy of the proceedings of the Magistrate's Court,

relied upon by the Petitioner. However, the learned High Court Judge has

held that the description of the boundaries to lot No.3 in the application is

different to that of the quit notice and therefore to execute a defective quit

notice is unjust but made no reference to the assertion of the Appellant of

an error in the certified copy.

In support of its conclusion, the Provincial High Court reproduced

the boundaries of the lot No.3 as follows;

North:

East :

South:

West:

Lot Nos. 5, 3 and Road

Road

Road and lot No.8 of Sankuhar Estate

Lot Nos. 8 and 5

In extent of land 0.0516 Hectares

The quit notice which was served on the Respondent describes the boundaries to Lot No.3 as follows;

3

North:

East :

South:

West:

Lot No.2 and Road

Road and Lot No.4

Lot Nos. 4 and 5

Lot Nos. 5 and 2

In extent of land 0.0865 Hectares

In the application to the Magistrate's Court, the Appellant has described the boundaries to the said land as follows;

North:

East :

South:

West:

Lot No.2 and Road

Road and Lot No.4

Lot Nos. 4 and 5

Lot Nos. 5 and 2

In extent of land 0.0865 Hectares

Thus, it is clear upon perusal of the order, that the learned High

Court Judge was in error when he relied on a wrong description of the

boundaries to Lot No.3 in the certified copy to arrive at his finding that

the description of boundaries is incompatible. The Appellant in his

objections brought this fact to the notice of Court and in the circumstances,

the High Court should have called for the record from the relevant

Magistrate's Court, acting under Section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, to verify this claim of the Appellant. This

position was taken up by the Respondent for the 1st time in the Provincial

High Court. The Respondent only challenged the validity of the affidavit

filed by the Appellant before the Magistrate's Court.

4

The Respondent, in his written submissions to this Court repeated

his position.

The learned Magistrate, having considered the question whether

the Respondent has a "valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and this such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered unvalid", and

proceeded to answer it in the negative before issuing the order of eviction

as prayed for by the Appellant. This Court Concurs with this conclusion

reached by the learned Magistrate.

In the circumstances, this Court sets aside the order of the Provincial

High Court and affirm the order of eviction issued by the Magistrate's

Court on 11.02.2011 by allowing the appeal of the Appellant.

Appeal is allowed. No costs.
