Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena with Chamara Nanayakkarawasam for Petitioners-Appellants

Susantha Balapatabendi Senior Deputy Solicitor General for Respondents-Respondents

Written Submissions filed on: Petitioners-Appellants on 28.03.2018

Argued on: 8th February 2018

Decided on: 5th April 2018

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioners-Appellants (Appellants) were junior officers/employees attached to various

departments and institutions in the provincial public service of the Uva Province. The 1st

Respondent-Respondent (pt Respondent) called for applications for the limited competitive

examination for promotion to Class III of the Management Assistants service in the provincial

public service of the Uva Province. The examination was held on 20.11.2010 and the results were

released on or about 04.04.2011 and communicated to the Appellants. Interviews were

scheduled on 05.06.2011 for verification of the qualifications of the successful candidates. The

Appellants however claim that when they went for the interview on 05.06.2011 they were

informed that the interview has been cancelled. By letters dated 04.05.2011 marked O. 79 to

O. 110 the Appellants were informed that the Uva Provincial Public Service Commission had

unanimously decided to cancel the examination held on 20.11.2010 and as such the results of

the said exam is also cancelled.

The Appellants moved the Provincial High Court of the Uva Province Holden in Badulla to issue a

writ of certiorari to quash the order made by the Uva Provincial Public Service Commission

cancelling the examination and the results and a writ of mandamus to hold the interviews as

scheduled. The learned High Court judge dismissed the application and hence this appeal by the

Appellants.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 08.02.2018, we invited the parties to file written

submissions by 05.03.2018 on whether the application for a writ of certiorari to the Provincial

High Court of the Uva Province Holden in Badulla could have been maintained as the pt

Respondent is only the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province and none of its

members were made respondents to that application.

None of the parties filed any written submissions before the due date. However, the Appellants

filed written submissions on 28.03.2018 and we decided to consider them although filed out of

time.

There is no dispute in the pleadings that the impugned decision was taken by the Provincial Public

Service Commission of the Uva Province. However, the Appellants have not made all the

members of the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province respondents to the

application made to the High Court. Only the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva

Province and its Secretary has been made the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of certiorari is that the

person or authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed should be made

a respondent to the application. If it is a body of persons whose decision or exercise of power is

sought to be quashed each of the persons constituting such body who took part in taking the

impugned decision or the exercise of power should be made respondent. The failure to make him

or them respondents to the application is fatal and provides in itself a ground for the dismissal of

the application in limine. 1

Even where the exercise of power is by a legal person such as a corporate body, it is necessary

that the individual members of the governing body of the legal person who actually exercised the

power be made respondents. In Ukwatte v. DFCC Bank2 an application for a writ of certiorari to

quash a resolution of the bank, a legal person, passed by its Board of Directors failed as although

the Bank itself was a respondent, the individual members of its Board of Directors had not been

made respondents to the application. Our courts have in a long line of cases held that the failure

to make the members of the body of person who took part in the impugned exercise of power

as respondents is itself a ground for the refusal of the remedy.3

The Appellants have in their written submissions submitted that no objection was raised before

the High Court on the failure to add necessary parties and as such the Respondents-Respondents

have waived their right to raise an objection on that ground. This submission is flawed. The

Respondents have in their statement of objections dated 28.10.2011 raised the objection on

necessary parties at paragraph 01(u).

Further the Appellants have in their written submissions moved to amend the caption by adding

the members of the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province. They rely on Rule

5(3) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990. This application is misconceived in

law for several reasons. Firstly, no such application was made before the High Court although the

objection on necessary parties was raised there. It is far too late to entertain such an application.

Secondly, in any event, no proper application has been made although the parties were clearly

put on notice by this court about the defect on 08.02.2018. No such application can be made in

the written submissions. Thirdly, in terms of Rule 5(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990, Rule 5 applies where a public officer has been made a respondent in his

official capacity. In this case the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province has

been named the pt Respondent. It is not a public officer. In fact, it has no legal personality. Hence,

Rule 5(3) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 is inapposite to the facts of

this case.

As the Appellants have failed to make as respondents to this application all the members of the

Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province who took part in the decision sought to

be quashed, the application must be dismissed in limine.

Chairman, REPIA [(2000) 1 Sri.L.R. 1]; Dr. Gamini Goonetilleke and others v. The University of Colombo and others [(2006) 1 Sri.L.R. 3S0]

5

There is also an additional ground why the application of the Appellants must be refused. The

Appellants have sought a writ of mandamus compelling the respondents to hold the interviews

as scheduled. The issue is whether it is sufficient for the Appellants to only make the Provincial

Public Service Commission of the Uva Province a party to such application or whether all the

members of the Provincial Public Service Commission of the Uva Province should have been made

respondents.

The pleadings indicate that the interviews were to be held by the Provincial Public Service

Commission of the Uva Province. The prayer to the petition seeks a writ of mandamus compelling

the Respondents to hold the interview as scheduled. Where it is sought to command a body of

persons to exercise any power, each member of that body must be made a respondent. The

reason is if not, mandamus cannot be enforced by imposing a punishment for contempt of court

in the event that such body of persons fail to carry out the command of the court.4 Our courts

have consistently followed this rule.s

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned High

Court judge of the Provincial High Court of the Uva Province Holden in Badulla dated 28.08.2012.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
