Section 297 of the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to

Learned Deputy Solicitor General informs court that he has no objections

and court may make a suitable order. Since the appellant has been on

remand for a long period of time we decide to reduce the sentence to six

years rigorous imprisonment, the fine imposed will remain as it is. The

sentence should begin from the date of conviction which is 16.01.2012.

Subject to the above variation the judgment of the High Court is affirmed

and the conviction varied.
