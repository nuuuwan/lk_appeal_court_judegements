The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking, a mandate

in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash a part of an order given by the 1st

Respondent (Commissioner General of Labour) Ref. TEUAlAl1112008, marked

P7, dated 06/12/2013, which contains the payment of back wages to the Petitioner

from 08/02/2008 to 02/04/2009. This order was made by the 1st Respondent

subsequent to a Judgment given by this Court in CA. (writ) 539/2010, marked P3,

directing the 1 st Respondent to make an appropriate order for re-instatement of the

2nd Respondent, (workman) "with wages and other benefits which the workman.

would have received if his services had not been terminated". The 1 st Respondent

made the impugned order after an inquiry, as directed by Court.

3

The Petitioner Company has partly complied with the impugned order of

the 15t Respondent by fe-instating the 2nd Respondent, however has failed to

comply with the direction to pay back wages to the 2nd Respondent from

08/02/2002 to 02/04/2009 as reflected in the order given by the 15t Respondent

marked P3, which the Petitioner has sought to be quashed. The Petitioner is

relying on documents marked PI, and P2, in support, on the basis that the

Petitioner has not terminated the employment of the 2nd Respondent, as contended.

It is observed that the Petitioner has not relied on any legal basis to invoke

the writ jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the said determination. The said

failure on the part of the Petitioner is sufficient to reject the instant application.

However, I will proceed to evaluate the merits of this case.

The Petitioners case in brief, is that the 2nd Respondent kept away from

work and at no time did the Petitioner terminate his services. In support of the

above contention, the Petitioner relies on documents marked PI and P2, and

submits that the 2nd Respondent is not entitled for back wages since he has

received the salary for the rnonths of March and April 2008, as reflected in the

document marked PI. The Petitioner submits that the 2nd Respondent has drawn

his salary for March and April 2008, and that he has also drawn a loan of Rs,

80001- on the salary, as contained in the receipt signed by the said Respondent

marked P2. It is common ground that the 2nd Respondent was re-instated by the

4

Petitioner, as required by the first part of the impugned order, which remains

unchallenged.

The documents marked PI and P2, are challenged by the Respondents on

the basis that the 2nd Respondent was coerced andl or induced to sign the said

document on the pretext that his arrears of salary is paid to him in terms of the

impugned order and thereby deceiving the 2nd Respondent to sign the said

document marked PI. By documents marked 2R 7 and 2R8, the 2nd Respondent has

denied any involvement in writing the said document, marked PI.

Documents marked PI and P2, was not in issue, until the Petitioner

discovered the two documents at the time of filling this Petition. The Court

observes that the document marked P2, dated 10104/2008, attached to the Petition

is not a duly certified document and therefore, is not in compliance with rule 3 (1)

(a), of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990. The Court also

observe hand-written words, "GEBS (Pvt) Ltd" before the word Petty Cash

Voucher, printed on document marked P2, which creates a doubt on the

authenticity of the said document.

As pointed out by the Respondents, document marked PI, has come into

existence after the Judgment given by this Court and the impugned decision by the

1 st Respondent dated 06112/20 l3. In documents marked 2R 7 and 2R8, the 2nd

Respondent deny making the said document marked PI, and has explained giving

reasons as to why he placed his signature to a document, which he deny writing.

5

The said documents were not produced to this Court at the previous determination

or, at the inquiry held thereafter. Therefore, the credibility of documents marked

PI and P2 are in doubt, and therefore, is not safe to admit the said documents in

evidence.

Document marked PI, self-serves the Petitioner, to the extent that if

admitted, would negate the application by the 2nd Respondent made to the 1 st

Respondent dated 07/04/2008, that his services were unlawfully terminated by the

Petitioner on 08102/2008. Therefore, the instant application could be seen as a

covertly action by the Petitioner to challenge the impugned determination in it's

entirely and thereby put in to question the validity of the re-instatement of the 2nd

Respondent by the Petitioner.

In the case of Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. Vs. Ceylon Commercial and

Industrial Workers Union and others 2000 (3) SLR 170, submitted by the 2nd

Respondent, the Court held, that;

"------ if a litigant as the Petitioner in this case intended to contradict the

record, he should have filed the necessary papers before the court or

tribunal as the case may be and initiated an inquiry before such authority

in the first instance. It is thereafter, that he should raise the matter in the

appropriate proceedings before the Court of Appeal so that such court

would be in a possession on the material before it to make a proper

6

determination with the benefit of the order of the deciding authority in the

lrst mstance-----ji. "

The challenge to the impugned determination marked P7, is based on

documents marked PI and P2. l .. 'or reasons stated above, the said documents relied

upon by the Petitioner are not tested by any authority, in the first instance and

therefore are not safe to be admitted as evidence.

In all the above circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
