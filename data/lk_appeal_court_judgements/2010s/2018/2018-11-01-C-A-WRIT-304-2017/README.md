The Petitioner has filed this application on 1ih September 2017 seeking inter

alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision taken on 4th October 2016 by

the 2nd Respondent to proceed with Customs inquiry No.

PCAD/HQO/36/2016;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from proceeding with

the said inquiry;

c) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to appoint another

Officer of Sri Lanka Customs as Inquiry Officer, in place of the 2nd

Respondent.

Having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in

support of this application, Court directed that written submissions be

tendered by both parties. In the written submissions filed on behalf of the

Respondents, the learned State Counsel has informed this Court that the 1st

Respondent Director General of Customs has appointed a new Inquiry Officer

in place of the 2nd Respondent, as a compromise to re-commence the Customs

Inquiry. Thus, the necessity for this Court to consider the Writ of Mandamus

does not arise. The learned State Counsel has also submitted that when the

Inquiry re-commenced under the new Inquiry Officer, an objection had been

taken by the Petitioner that the 3rd Respondent cannot be a witness for the

reason that he had retired from service. Although the said objection had been

I

overruled by the Inquiry Officer, the Petitioner had not taken part at the

inquiry thereafter, bringing the said inquiry to a halt.

The facts which are relevant to the consideration of the relief sought are as

follows.

The Petitioner is carrying on a sole proprietorship under the name, style and

firm of 'Greenways'. The said entity is engaged in the importation of electrical

goods and gas (LPG) cookers, gas (LPG) regulators and other LPG appliances.

The Petitioner claims that without having an 'iota of evidence' against him, the

officers of Sri Lanka Customs had 'raided' his shop situated at Colombo 11 and

requested the Petitioner to grant them access to his email accounts without

having a Court order to that effect. The Petitioner states that Sri Lanka

Customs had thereafter commenced an inquiry against the Petitioner, with

regard to certain imports made by the Petitioner. The Petitioner has annexed

to the petition, marked 'X4', a copy of the inquiry proceedings and the

documents marked at the said Inquiry.

This Court has examined 'X4' and observes that the Inquiry had commenced on

26th April 2016 and proceedings have been held over several days during the

course of which the evidence of the Customs Officers who had been involved

in the investigations had been recorded. This is inspite of the Inquiry having

been postponed on several occasions, due to the absence of the Petitioner.

This Court also observes that the Petitioner had been represented by an

Attorney-at-Law at the Customs Inquiry and that the prosecution witnesses

had been cross examined by the Petitioner's Counsel.

According to tX4', the prosecution officer at the Inquiry had submitted that

when the officers of the Post Audit Compliance and Facilitating Directorate of

the Sri Lanka Customs examined the previous import documents of the

Petitioner, it was discovered that the values declared by the Petitioner are very

low compared to similar goods in the market. Therefore, Sri Lanka Customs

had decided to investigate the previous imports of the Petitioner and had

called over at the address declared by the Petitioner to Sri Lanka Customs.

However, the customs found that there was no such business at the given

address.

The Officers of Sri Lanka Customs had later found that the Petitioner was

operating from a different address, and had then visited the said premises.

After questioning the Petitioner, the Officers of Sri Lanka Customs had

removed the computers of the Petitioner for further examination. The Officers

of Sri Lanka Customs had retrieved deleted email correspondence between the

Petitioner and his business counterparts which had revealed evidence

suggestive of the Petitioner having undervalued the goods imported by him.

In considering the relief sought by the Petitioner, the first step for this Court is

to examine the basis of the application in the context of the provisions of the

Customs Ordinance.

The Customs Ordinance stands on three important pillars. The first is that all

goods imported (or exported) to the country must be declared to Sri Lanka

Customs!. The second is that a proper and truthful description of the goods

must be made at the time of importation. The third and final pillar is that the

price actually paid or payable for the goods must be declared at the time of

1 Section 47 ofthe Customs Ordinance.

5

importation2 One without the other will not enable Sri Lanka Customs to

charge the correct import duties and taxes on the goods imported into the

country. This is reflected in Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance, which reads

as follows:

liThe several duties of customs, as the same are respectively inserted,

described, and set forth in figures in the table of duties (Schedule A)3 shall

be levied and paid upon all goods, wares, and merchandise imported into

or exported from Sri Lanka".

Several provisions of the Customs Ordinance require an importer to declare

the value of the goods and sets out the consequences of not doing so. In terms

of Section 47 of the Customs Ordinance, every consignee is required to tender

a Bill of Entry, commonly referred to as the Customs Declaration or 'Cus Dec'

setting out the details that are required in the said declaration including the

value of the goods that are the subject matter of the said Bill of Entry.

Section 51 of the Customs Ordinance specifies that, 'In all cases when the

duties imposed upon the importation of articles are charged according to the

value thereof, the respective value of each such article shall be stated in the

entry together with the description and quantity of the same, and duly

affirmed by a declaration made by the importer or his agent on a form4 ... as

may be specified by the Director General ...... and such value shall be

determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule E, and duties shall

be paid on a value so determined.'

2 In terms of Schedule E of the Customs Ordinance, the customs value of any imported goods shall be the transaction value, that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to Sri Lanka, as may be adjusted and determined in accordance with the provisions of Schedule E.

4 This form is known as the 'Value Declaration Form.'

As set out earlier, a truthful declaration of the price actually paid or payable for

a good is paramount, for the Customs to determine the value of the import

and thereby, for a proper working of the Customs Ordinance. It is for this

reason that Sri Lanka Customs has the power to investigate any instance of

suspected undervaluation.5 In terms of Section 51A(2) of the Customs

Ordinance, Sri Lanka Customs has the power to amend the value declared at

the time of importation, even after the goods have been cleared by Customs.

Section 51A(2) reads as follows:

"If an officer of customs is satisfied as a result of an examination or

investigation, or an audit carried out under section 128A, at any time

prior to or after the clearance of the goods that the value declared by the

importer or his agent under an Article of Schedule E under which the

value was initially accepted, is not appropriate the officer of customs may

amend the value in accordance with the appropriate Article of Schedule

E."

Where however, the importer has deliberately declared a lower value than

what was actually paid, Sri Lanka Customs can act in terms of Section 52 of the

Customs Ordinance, which reads as follows:

"Where it shall appear to the officers of the customs that the value

declared in respect of any goods according to section 51 is a false

5 In terms of Section SlA(l} of the Customs Ordinance, "whenever an officer of customs has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of any particulars contained in a bill of entry or a declaration made under section 51 or the documents presented to him in support of a bill of entry under section 47, the officer of customs may require the importer or his agent or any other party connected with the importation of goods, to furnish such other information, including documentary or other evidence in proof of the fact that the declared customs value represents the total amount actually paid or is payable for the imported goods as adjusted in accordance with Article 8 of Schedule E."

declaration, the goods in respect of which such declaration has been

made shall be forfeited together with the package in which they are

contained. Where such goods are not recoverable, the person making

such false declaration shall forfeit either treble the value of such goods or

be liable to a penalty of one hundred thousand rupees, at the election of

the Collector of Customs."

This Court has examined the evidence led at the Inquiry in the presence of the

Petitioner and his Attorney-at-Law and notes that Sri Lanka Customs has

obtained from the custody of the Petitioner and produced documents relating

to several instances of alleged undervaluation by the Petitioner. According to

the evidence of the Customs Officer, the aggregate of the taxes not paid as a

result of the undervaluation amounted to Rs. 26,491,087.

According to the Respondents, one such instance of undervaluation is revealed

by the documents marked as 'D10a' - 'D10e' at the Customs Inquiry. According

to the invoice submitted by the foreign supplier6 on 23rd June 2015, the actual

value of the goods is USD 25038. However, by an email7 sent the same day by

the Petitioner to one Andy Su, the Petitioner had stated that a sum of USD

10030 has already been paid and proposed that the invoice value be reduced

to USD 15008. This was followed by the Petitioner himself sending to the

supplier an amended invoice, quoting a price of USD 15008. The supplier has in

turn sent the Petitioner the invoiceB for USD 14341 for the gas cookers, and a

sum of USD 667 for miscellaneous items, attached to his email of 24th June

20159. In respect of this transaction, the Customs Deciaration10 to clear the

6 Invoice has been marked as 'D10Y at the Inquiry.

7 The email has been marked as 'D10h' at the Inquiry.

8 The amended invoice has been marked as 'D10d' at the Inquiry.

9 The email sent by the supplier is found at the bottom of'D10h'.

10 The Customs Declaration has been marked as 'D10b' at the Inquiry.

goods gives the value of the goods as USD 14341. The Petitioner has even

submitted a value declaration formll in respect of this transaction. According

to the Customs Declaration, the customs duty has been calculated on the

lower value of USD 14341, thus causing a loss of revenue to the State, on the

face of the documents. It is emphasised at this stage that this Court has not

arrived at any finding that the Petitioner has undervalued goods imported by

him, which is a determination that the Inquiry Officer may make, should he be

satisfied that there is sufficient evidence in that regard, after having

considered the evidence at the inquiry.

It is in these circumstances that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to

prevent Sri Lanka Customs Ordinance from proceeding with the inquiry. In

considering this application, it would be appropriate for this Court to bear in

mind the following statement of Lord Diplock in the case of Council of Civil

Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service12:

flJudicial review has, I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first

ground I would call flillegality", the second flirrationality" and the third

flprocedural impropriety."

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has presented four arguments to

support his position that the inquiry should not be proceeded with. It is

observed that the Petitioner is not complaining of any irrationality or

11 Section 51 requires every importer to submit a value declaration form (VDF). The VDF has been annexed to the Customs Declaration marked 'D10b.'

procedural impropriety but is claiming that the collection of evidence and the

decision to hold the inquiry is illegal, which Diplock J, has described as follows:

"By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making

power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a

justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons,

the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable."

The Petitioner claims that Customs duty on the goods imported by him has

been imposed not on the value of the good but on 'per piece' basis. The

Petitioner's first argument therefore is that where customs duty on a good is

not charged based on its value, Sri Lanka Customs cannot invoke the provisions

of Section 51 of the Customs Ordinance. This Court has examined the

documents marked at the Inquiry in the presence of the Petitioner and his

Attorney-at-Law, and notes that the Petitioner has in fact submitted Value

Declaration Forms in terms of Section 51, at the time he submitted the

Customs Declarations, which indicates that customs duty is payable on the

value. Furthermore, this Court observes, as per some of the Customs

Declarations produced at the inquiry that customs duties have been charged

on the value of the goods imported as opposed to the number of pieces.13

Thus, the first argument of the Petitioner is incorrect and is devoid of any

merit. This Court is of the view that issues such as the basis of calculating

duties and the rate at which customs duties have in fact been paid, are matters

that need to be decided at the Customs Inquiry, where the Petitioner will be

afforded an opportunity of challenging the evidence led.

13 This is borne out by the Customs Declarations marked as 'D10b', 'DUb', 'D12b', 'D13b', 'D14b', 'D1Sc' and 'D20b' at the Inquiry.

The second argument of the Petitioner is that the goods that he had imported

were not liable to customs duty but were only liable to Value Added Tax (VAT),

Port and Airport Levy (PAL) etc and that value is immaterial. This argument is

not accurate as this Court observes that the Petitioner has in fact paid customs

duties on the goods imported by him on several occasions, as borne out by the

Customs Declarations produced at the Customs Inquiry14, while on some other

occasions, no customs duties have been paid. In any event, VAT and PAL are

calculated on the value of the goods and for that reason, declaration of the

transaction value is important.

The third argument of the Petitioner is that Sri Lanka Customs cannot 'recover'

VAT, after the goods have been cleared by Sri Lanka Customs. The Petitioner

contends that Sri Lanka Customs can only collect VAT at the point of

importation15 but has no basis to proceed with an inquiry to 'recover' VAT, as

the power of 'recovery' of VAT is vested with the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue. In support of this argument, the Petitioner has referred to

several judgments of this Court and the Supreme Court.

This Court observes that the scope of the Customs Inquiry against the

Petitioner relates to ascertaining whether there has been undervaluation. The

commencement of every customs inquiry cannot be presumed to be aimed at

"recovery" of duties or "levies." If the declaration of the value is false, the

Inquiry Officer is empowered to forfeit the goods in terms of the law. If

however, there is no evidence of undervaluation and the evidence reveals that

there has been only a short levy of duties due, then the Director General of

14 ibid.

15 Section 2(3) of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002, as amended, reads as follows: 'The tax on the importation of goods, shall be charged, levied and collected as if it is a customs duty and as if all goods imported into Sri Lanka are dutiable and liable to customs duty'.

11

Customs is empowered to demand the short levy in terms of Section 18(2) of

the Customs Ordinance which reads as follows:

"When any duties, dues or charges on any imported or exported, have

been short levied or any such duties, dues or charges after having been

levied, have been erroneously refunded the persons chargeable with the

duties, dues or charges so short levied or to whom such refund has

erroneously been made shall pay the deficiency or repay the amount so

erroneously refunded."

This Court is of the view that Section 18 of the Customs Ordinance is based on

the principle of nunc pro tunc - now for then. Thus, when acting in terms of

Section 18(2), Sri Lanka Customs has the power to collect the same duties,

dues or charges that it ought to have collected at the time of the importation

of the goods. In doing so, Sri Lanka Customs is not usurping the powers

conferred on the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue to 'recover' Value

Added Tax, for the simple reason that what Sri Lanka Customs is doing is not

'recovery' but 'collection.'

This position is further buttressed by the provisions of Section 51A (2) which

specifically provides that, lithe officer of customs may amend the value in

accordance with the appropriate Article of Schedule E." The necessary

consequences of amending the value is the collection of customs duties, taxes

and levies that ought to have been collected at the time of the importation of

the goods if the declaration had reflected the correct value of the good. The

legislature certainly has not prohibited Sri Lanka Customs from collecting all

taxes that should have been collected at the point of importation and this

Court cannot read such a restriction into Section 51A(2) or Section 18.

In the event the declaration of the value is false, the Inquiry Officer has the

power to act in terms of Section 52 of the Customs Ordinance and forfeit

treble the value of the goods. The forfeiture does not amount to a recovery of

taxes. Thus, this Court is of the view that there is no merit in the third

argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The fourth argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

evidence that has been presented by Sri Lanka Customs is based on emails that

the Petitioner exchanged with his suppliers, which the Petitioner claims are

privileged and protected by privacy laws. The Petitioner claims that by being

asked to divulge the contents of the said emails, the Petitioner has been

compelled to incriminate himself. This contention is incorrect in view of the

provisions of Sections 128 and 128A of the Customs Ordinance, which will be

referred to below .

The claim of self incrimination is misplaced in this instance because Section

128(1) of the Customs Ordinance empowers Customs Officers to enter and

search premises and collect evidence, examine records etc. The following

provisions of Section 128 of the Customs Ordinance are relevant to a

consideration of the Petitioner's argument and hence, are re-produced.

Section 128(1)

liThe Director-General or any officer of customs authorised in that behalf

in writing by the Director-General may-

(a) at all reasonable hours by day or night enter and search any building

or place in which he suspects there are:

(iii) Any books of accounts or other documents containing any

evidence relating to an offence under this Ordinance which, or

which he suspects, has been or is being committed"

(b) Break open any door, vault, chest, trunk, package or other place of

storage which he may consider reasonably necessary to break for the

purpose of exercising his powers under the preceding provisions of

this subsection; and

(c) Where he discovers any such goods, books or documents, seize and

store them in a place of security selected by the Director-General.

Section 128A of the Customs Ordinance confers wide powers of investigation

on the officers of the Sri Lanka Customs for the purpose of audit and

examination of records. The provisions of Section 128A which are relevant to

this application are as follows:

"(1) The Director-General or any officer of customs authorized in that

behalf in writing by the Director-General may-

(a) at all reasonable hours of the day or night enter any building or

place where records are kept in accordance with section 51B and

audit or examine such records on any matter pertaining to

customs either in relation to specific transactions or to the

1A

adequacy and integrity of the manual or electronic systems by

which such records are created and stored.

(b) open and examine any receptacle where any book of account

register, record or any other document may be found for the

purposes of the preceding provisions of this Ordinance.

c) examine and take copies of or make extracts from or take

possession of any book of account register, other document

found in such place or building.

(d) operate any computer found in any building and make copies or

take printouts of the whole or part of any entries recorded or

stored therein.

(3) Any book of account, register, record or other document taken into

his possession under subsection (1) by any officer may be retained in

the possession of such officer for the examination of such book,

register, record or document or for the institution of legal

proceedings against the person to whom such book, register, record

or other document belongs."

This Court must note that any person who obstructs the Director-General or an

officer of customs in exercising any of his powers vested under Section 128 and

128A shall be guilty of an offence16

16 Section 128(3) and Section 128A(S) of the Customs Ordinance.

11:

In the context of the fourth argument made by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner, this Court observes that Officers of Sri Lanka Customs have been

given access to the computers and to the email addresses of the Petitioner by

the Petitioner himself. Had the Petitioner refused to give such access to the

email addresses maintained by him, the said Officers could have obtained an

order from the Magistrate's Court. However, the necessity to do so did not

arise as the Petitioner himself had provided access.

This Court is of the view that the wide investigative powers conferred on the

officers of Sri Lanka Customs permit the officers to obtain copies of email

correspondence between an importer and his consignor or any other person

and to utilise such materials to prosecute an importer for any offence under

the Customs Ordinance. The law does not prohibit email correspondence

exchanged between an importer and a third party being used by Sri Lanka

Customs to establish that an importer is guilty of violating the provisions of the

Customs Ordinance and therefore this Court does not see any illegality in using

emails as evidence. Furthermore, no special importance should be attached to

electronic evidence or email correspondence and it is in law similar to evidence

that Sri Lanka Customs may recover from an importer.

This Court would now consider if the Petitioner had been compelled to

incriminate himself. This Court observes that after the conclusion of the

evidence by the prosecution, the Petitioner had commenced his evidence, at

which point this application was filed by the Petitioner, seeking to prevent Sri

Lanka Customs from proceeding with the said Inquiry on the basis that the

Petitioner cannot be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.

The scope of an inquiry conducted by Sri Lanka Customs has been considered

by this Court in the case of Anton Clement Thomas Dawson and another V.

Neville Gunwardena17, where Sri Skandaraja J held as follows:

"It appears that the inquiry is to ascertain what are the charges that could

be framed in the given circumstances. So it is left to the Customs Officials

to ascertain facts either from any witness or from suspects to frame a

charge and thereafter to explain the charge to the suspect and to give him

an opportunity to call for evidence. But at the end of leading evidence if

the Customs find, that there cannot be charge{s} framed, the inquiry will

come to an end at that point. "

The purpose of Sri Lanka Customs conducting the inquiry which is the subject

matter of this application is to determine whether the evidence establishes

that an offence has been committed under the Customs Ordinance. In this

particular instance, the offence suspected to have been committed was one of

undervaluation, which could be dealt with under Section 51A{2} or Section 52

of the Customs Ordinance.

Section 51A was introduced by the Customs {Amendment} Act No.2 of 2003

and as observed by Sripavan J {P/CA)(as he then was}, flit is to be borne in mind

that the amending act No.2 of 2003 enables the officers of the customs to

take a decision in accordance with the principles of natural justice. It is implied

by natural justice in the construction of all laws, that no one ought to suffer

any prejudice without having first an opportunity of defending himself. The

opportunity would be given to the petitioner, if requested, once the customs

17

officer amends the customs value, in accordance with the appropriate Article

of Schedule E." 18 The evidence that would transpire at the inquiry would also

enable the Customs Officer to inform the basis upon which the amendment, if

any, is made to the initial value19

Thus, it appears that the purpose of recording the evidence of the Petitioner

was to enable the Petitioner to give his side of the story prior to arriving at a

determination. If the Inquiry Officer is satisfied, after hearing the evidence of

the importer that there is insufficient evidence to amend the value, the inquiry

ends there. However, in the event the Inquiry Officer is satisfied that there is

sufficient evidence that the value declared by the importer which was initially

accepted, is not appropriate, then, the Inquiry Officer can act under Section

51A{2} and amend the value. An importer who is dissatisfied with any decision

of the Inquiry Officer in terms of Section 51A{2} has been conferred a right of

appeal to the Director General, who is required to give written reasons for his

decision. The final situation is where the Inquiry Officer is satisfied on the

evidence that the Petitioner has submitted a false declaration, in which event

the provisions of Section 52 may be applied.

This Court has examined 'X4' and is of the view that the Petitioner has not

been compelled to give evidence or to incriminate himself. Thus, this Court

does not see any merit in the fourth argument of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner has not submitted any material to establish that the actions of

Sri Lanka Customs are illegal or that Sri Lanka Customs have not followed the

19 Section SlA(4) of the Customs Ordinance requires Sri Lanka Customs to provide to the importer, if requested, a written explanation as to how the declared value, was amended in terms of Section Sla(2).

due process. This Court is satisfied that the Respondents have adhered to the

statutory procedure laid down in the Customs Ordinance and does not see a

legal basis to interfere with the statutory process. In these circumstances, this

Court does not see any illegality with the decision of the Inquiry Officer to

proceed with the customs inquiry and therefore does not see any legal basis to

issue notices on the Respondents.

This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs. This Court directs the

1st Respondent to ensure that the Customs Inquiry is proceeded with and

concluded expeditiously, as a period of over two and half years has lapsed

since the commencement of the inquiry.
