This revision application was filed by the Hon. Attorney General seeking to revise

and set aside the order of the Learned j-Iigh Court Judge of Badulla in Case No.

93/2014 dated 10.10.2016.

Facts of the Case: ,. .. ' ~c

The Accused-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) was indicted

in the High Court of Badulla for committing the offence of Criminal Breach of

Trust on or about 18.04.2014 by concealing 420 litres of Diesel Oil in a secret

compartment in the oil bowser bearing~No. NCLC 5842, being the driver of the

said tank, without unloading the same to the Badulla district store of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and misappropriated a sum of Rs. 50,8201= thereby

, committing an offence punishable under section 389 of the Penal Code read with

.1 section 5(1) of the Offences Against ,Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as

amended by Act No. 76 of 1988.

Page2 of 11

The indictment was read over to the Respondent on 09.12.2014 and the case was , . fixed for trial since the Respondent had p~eaded not guilty to the said offence. On

the first date of the trial, the Respondent had informed the court his willingness to

plead guilty and had made a representation to the Hon. Attorney General

(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner), to consider amending the indictment to

withdraw the charge framed against the Respondent under the Offences Against

Public Property Act. However, the Petitioner had informed Court about the

inability to amend the indictment and haq informed that the Petitioner wished to

proceed against the Respondent under the'same indictment. Accordingly when the

case was re fixed for trial on 14.06.2016, the Respondent had again informed the

willingness to plead guilty to the indictment. Thereafter the Petitioner had

amended the indictment to include the amount misappropriated by the Respondent

~I and on 29.08.2016, the Respondent ha? pleaded guilty to the said amended

indictment. Accordingly the Learned High Court Judge of Badulla had convicted

the Respondent and had imposed the follo\ving sentences;

1) A term of 01 year simple imprisonment,

2) A fine of Rs. 152,4601=, if default a term of 12 months simple

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said sentence ord~r of the Learned High Court Judge, the

Petitioner has filed a revision applicatipn in this Court, seeking to revise the

sentence imposed on the Respondent and substitute a lawful and appropriate

sentence.

The Petitioner has submitted following'~\ grounds as exceptional circumstances

which warrant the exercise of revisionaryj'urisdiction of this Court .

i

Page 3Jf 11

I'

a) The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the loss for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation,j

b) The Sentence imposed is wholly disproportionate, unreasonable and

.~. I'~ grossly inadequate when consiqering the facts of the case,

c) The sentencing order is illegal, vvrongful and contrary to law,

d) The sentence is contrary to sentencing policy set out in the judicial

authorities.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel & Others (2004) 1 SLR 284, it was held

that,

HIn any event to exercise revisioneJry jurisdiction the order chcdlenged must

have occasioned a failure of justige and be manifestly erroneous which go

,', beyond an error or defect or irr..~gularity that an ordinary person would

; instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscienf of court ... "

') The Learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Petitioner has not

1: exercised the right of appeal available to him and therefore the Petitioner is not

entitled to invoke the revisionary juri!sdiction of this court. Accordingly the

'1, Learned Counsel has submitted following cases.

1) Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 SLLR 225

2) Selliyah Marimuttu v Sivapakkiyam (1986) 1 CALR 264.

In the case of Rustom v. Ha pangama (1978-79) 2 SLLR 225, it was held that,

Hft is established that this Courz: can intervene by way of revision even

where right of appeal exists if the .failure to exercise such right is explained ", to the satisfaction of court ... "

"

The Learned State Counsel for the Petiti9ner submitted that the delay for the filing

of the Petition was due to the administr&tive procedures that needed to be done in

(, filing a revision. The Attorney General' had not moved in appeal in this rnatte'r

since the appeal time had lapsed.

In the case of W.M. Francisca v.,Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.I108/99 (F)], it was held that,

"It is trite law that the purpose of 'revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory in

nature, and that the object is~he proper administration of justice. In

Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

"Revision, like an appeal, is direc~ed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its pbject is the due administration of justice

!" and not, primarily or solely, the: relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a party>,vho is entitled to it, may claim to have as

H T of right, and its object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order

of court which is tainted by error.<. "

In the case of Gunaratne v. Thambinayagam and others (1993) 2 SLR 355, it

was stated that,

"These were cases in which the power of the former Supreme Court and this

" Court to set aside a decree nisl in a partition action by revision was

considered. Much earlier in Attorney- General v. Podisingho 51 NLJ!.

385(an application for the revision of the order of a Magistrate in a criminal , case), Dias J. said that this power" ('which is discretion) is exercised "where

i there is a positive miscarriage of justice in regard either to the law or to the

~ t Judge's appreciation of the facts "(P 388). It was held that this power is not

<; limited to cases where there is no appeal,' and that" it is wide enough to

Page'S of 11

embrace a case where an appeal lay {Jut which for some reason was not

taken" (P 390).

In the case of AG v. Ranasinghe and others (1993) 2 Sri L.R. 81, it was held

that,

"Thus it is seen that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of section 364 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure ActwNo. 15 of 1979 is wide and is specially

directed at vesting a jurisdiction in this Court to satisfy itself as to the

legality or propriety of any sen~ence passed by the High Court or the

Magistrate's Court. The judgment relied upon by learned Counsel in the

case of Rustom vs. Hapangama (supra) relates to a civil proceeding where

~ the matter of sentence does nOf .. arise. It is clear on a perusal of th~

judgment, that this Court refused to exercise revisionary jurisdiction

primarily on the basis that the petitioner had not availed himself of the leave

to appeal procedure set out in the Civil Procedure Code ... We have to

observe that this consideration do?,s not apply in relation to a criminal case

where the jurisdiction is exercised in terms of section 364 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure. Furthermor.e we are inclined to agree with the

subn1ission of the learned SSC thar the decisions of the Supreme Court in the

cases of the Attorney-General :vs. H N. de Silva (2) and Gomes vs

Leelaratne (3) firmly establish the~principle that in considering the propriety , of a sentence that has been passed~ this Court has a wide power of review, irz

revision. This jurisdiction is notfettered by the fact that Hon. Attorne}~

General has not availed of the rig~t of appeal. "

..

I In the case of Buddhadasa Kaluarachch~ v. Nilamani Wijewickrama and

Another 11990] 1 Sri L R 262, it was held that,

"The trend o/recent decisions is!(hat the Court of Appeal has the power to

act in revision even though the procedure by way of appeal is available il<)

appropriate cases. In Rustom v. ijapangama & Co.(4) it was held that the

I', I powers by way of revision confefred on the appellate court are very wide

'J and can be exercised whether an9Ppeal has been taken against an order of

the original court or not. However such powers would be exercised only in

exceptional circumstances rvhere. an appeal lay and as to what such

exceptionable circumstances are,: _ is dependent on the facts of each case.

Vythialingam, J stated in Rustom,v. Hapangama & Co (supra) "where an

" order is palpably wrong and a./f.ects the rights of a party also, this court . would exercise its powers of revision to set aside the wrong irrespective of

whether an appeal1vas taken or ~as available ... "

In the case of Rasheed Ali v. Mohamed;x\Ji (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

tilt is well established that the pi)wers of revision conferred on this Court

,'" are very wide and the Court has ~he discretion to ~xercise them whether an

appeal lies or not or whether an appeal where it lies has been taken or not.

But this discretionary remedy can be invoked only where there are

, ' f exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of the Court ... "

Accordingly taking a similar view, we ~old that this revision needs to be allowed

since we are inclined to ascertain the proportionality of the sentence imposed by

the Learned High Court Judge.

Section 5( 1) of the Offences against F)ubli~ Property Act No.12 of 1982 as

amended reads as follows;

UAny person who dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use,

any movable Public property or commits the offence of criminal breach of'

trust of any movable Public Property shall be guilty of an offence and shall

upon conviction be punished with imprisonment of either description for a

, , term not less than one year but n~t exceeding twenty years, and with a fine

of one thousand rupees or three tfitles the value of the property in respect of

" which such offence was committed, lvhichever amount is higher. "

The Senior State Counsel for the Petitioper submitted that there had been a secret

compartment inside the oil bowser beadbg No. NCLC 5842, which was covered

~:J . with a mesh and that secret compartment ',was operated with the use of a tool called

"Allen Key". This bowser was duly examined and officially measured before

absorbing the vehicle to the Ceylon Pe'troleum Corporation for the purpose of.

transporting oil and this secret compartrAent was not detected at the time of said

, ' . I examination. It was further submitted that the officials were unaware of a time as

to the creation of said secret compartmerlt, JJut since the initial examination and the

detection of the said compartment, the bowser was engaged in transporting oil for

about 307 times.

It has been held in the case of The Attorney General v. H.N. de Silva 57 NLR

121, that,

HIn assessing the punishment that'should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of th~

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the questiory,

; only from the angle of the offen4er. A Judge should, in determining the

I

Page 8 of 11

'.:'".~" .. : .,.

j,

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears /roln ,

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

" , provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard>;he effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position

of trust or belonged to a servic~ which enjoys the public confidence that

must be taken into account in assessing the punishment. The incidence of

crimes of the nature o/which the:ofJender has been/ound to be guilty 3[R'ex

v. Boyd (1908) 1 Cr. App. Rep. 64.] and the difficulty of detection are also

matters which should receive due consideration. The reformation of the

criminal, though no doubt an inlportant consideration, is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare of the State

~'I (which are synonymous) outweighs 'the previous good character, antecedents

and age of the offender, public interest must prevail ... "

It was held in the case of Attorney General v. Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and another

[1995] 1 Sri L R 157 that;

{(In determining the proper sentence the Judge should consider the gravity

j of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

~ regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute und.~r

which the offender is charged., He should also regard the effect of t~e

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effect{\'~e.,

Incidence of crimes of the nature. of which the offender has been found guilty

i and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

:' 'if consideration. The Judge should 111so take into account the nature of the loss

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

detection. Another matter to be 't{lken into account is that the offences were

Pagl~ 9 of 11

planned crimes for wholesale profit. The Judge must consider the interests . . , of the accused on the one hand and t~e interests of society on the other ... "

\

, It is our considered view that the Respondent had committed this CrIme with

premeditation, pre-planning and much deliberation. Therefore we find that the

If sentence imposed by the Learned Hig~ll Court Judge of Badulla is grossly

\' inadequate and is out of proportion having regard to the magnitude of the crime

that had been committed.

Considering above, we enhance the senten'ce imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge from one year to three years. Since jthe Respondent has already served one

year in prison he is ordered to serve another. two more years.

Accordingly the revision application is aIlo;wed.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of the Judgment to the relevant High Court of .

BaduHa in order to pronounce the Judgment and to take necessary steps to

fPprehend the Accused-Respondent.
