The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter alia, for

mandates in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash Gazette Notifications dated

06/0112015 and 07/1012015, marked P7A, P8(a), P8(b), and P8(c), and writ of

Prohibition to restrain the 1 st and 2nd Respondents taking any steps to acquire

possession of the Petitioner's property to implement the proposed Phase III of the

4

Baseline road expansion project in terms of proviso (a), to section 38 of the Land

Acquisition Act (sometimes hereinafter referred to as "the Act").

The Petitioner challenges the said acquisition on the following grounds;

(a) i) the Respondents cannot make use of proviso (a) of Section 38, of the

Act, as there is no urgency.

ii) no valid notice was given to the Petitioner in terms of Section 2 of the

Act.

(b) The Respondents have failed to utilize the already existing reservation over

Robert Gunerwardene Mawatha.

The Petitioner states, that as evident in the newspaper articles marked P9(a)

and P9(b), the said project was abandoned from time to time, and therefore the

Respondents are not entitled to utilize the proviso (a) of Section 38, of the Act in

order to divert from the normal acquisition process. The Petitioner has cited the

case of Fernandopulle Vs. Minister of Lands and Agriculture 792NLR 115, and

submits that proviso (a) to Section 38,of the Act is a special provision made

available only in instances of urgency, and therefore has been utilized by the

Respondents for no valid reason.

Sub paragraph (a) to section 38(a), of the Act reads as follows;

"Provided that the Minister may make an order under the preceding provisions of

this section -

5

(aJ where it becomes necessary to take immediate possession of any land on

the ground of any urgency, at any time after a notice under section 2 is

exhibited for the first time in the area in which that land is situated or at

any time after a notice under section 4 is exhibited for the first time on

or near that land, and

"

It is observed that the Section 2 notice bearing No. COIDSO/20 131605,

dated 30106/2014, has been issued after cancelling the Section 2 notice issued on

15/05/2013. The Section 2 notice dated 30106/2014 was once again cancelled and

replaced by a Section 2 notice dated 29/08/2014. The documents attached to the 1 st

Respondent's Statement of Objections marked lRl, and the 4th Respondent's

Statement of Objections in the connected cases marked as 4RIA and 4RIB,

clearly indicates that as required, notice under Section 2 was exhibited in the area

where the land is situated. As the law stands at present, there is no legal

requirement to serve notice under Section 2 of the Act on all persons whose lands

are eventually acquired. What the law requiresby this Section is that the notice

under Section 2 be exhibited in some conspicuous place in the area where the land

is situated. Document marked lRl, clearly indicates that the said notice was

exhibited where the land is situated and also at the relevant Grama Niladhari

Office. Therefore, it is observed that a valid Section 2 notice on a decision by the

Minister was in fact issued by the land acquiring officer, prior to the gazette

6

notification of the taking of possession of the land, in terms of proviso (a) to

Section 38 of the Act.

The delay caused to implement the said road project is attributed to the

proposed stages of development of the Road, and the process of acquiring land for

pre-defined phases, which were not necessitated to be acquired simultaneously.

The delay has been attributed to public protests by the Petitioner and few other

occupants of lands in the vicinity and the numerous appeals lodged in respect of

the said acquisition and also to the long drawn litigation, initiated by various

interested parties. Therefore, the delay caused in implementing the phase III of the

Base Line Road extension project could be attributed to reasons not within and! or

outside the control of the authorities.

In the case of Fernandopulle Vs. Minister of Land and Agriculture

(supra), the court considered, inter alia, the Minister's decision regarding urgency

and the need to take immediate possession, where the Court held that a Petitioner

who seeks a remedy by way of Certiorari should satisfy the Court that there was in

fact no urgency. The Court also held that;

"if one looks at the entire Act two main powers are given to the minister. They

are:

1. The power to decide whether the land is required for a public purpose and

to direct that it be acquired, and

2. Whether there is an urgency compelling the immediate possession being

taken of the land and to direct that possession be taken."

7

The Petitioner submits that due to the delay caused in the acquisition

process, the Respondents have failed to show that there is an urgency compelling

the immediate possession of the Petitioner's land and therefore, the said

acquisition does not come within the scope of proviso ( a) of Section 38 of the Act.

According to the Master Plan, the Base Line Road extension project has

been designed to be implemented in three stages. The said road is a key highway

connecting the north and south regions of the Greater Colombo area. It is observed

that the expansion of the road would undoubtedly contribute to greater mobility to

the existing road network and has the capacity to enhance socio-economic

development in the area which covers the road expanSIOn project. The

implementation of this project would necessitate to identify and acquire large

extents of privately owned land. The Respondents submit that the scale of their

development project and the obligation to look into all aspects of the rights of the

affected citizens has compelled the implementation of the said project in three

stages, and therefore deny any delay attributed to the Respondents caused in the

said acquisition process.

In the case of Fernandopulle Vs. Minister of Lands and Agriculture

(Supra), the court further held, that;

"an order by the minister under the proviso to Section 38 of the Land

Acquisition Act can be made only in cases of urgency and an order made

under the proviso can be reviewed by the courts. It is however a matter for

a petitioner who seeks the remedy by way of Certiorari, to satisfy the court

8

that there was in fact no urgency and his application cannot succeed should

he fail to do so. "

Both parties have referred to the case of Amerasinghe and others Vs. the

Attorney General and others (1993) lSLR 376, (Colombo Katunayake

Expressway Case) where it was held that;

"urgency is always relative; sometimes action may be required within

hours; for an enormous project, such as the expressway, urgency may be a

matter of months or years. Considering that the project had been in

contemplation at least from 1983, and had already been delayed for almost

ten years, it is not unreasonable to consider, in the light of increases in

population, traffic, economic activity etc., that speedy implementation was

imperative ". -------

It is common ground that the land to be acquired is for the Baseline

extension road, an urban development project which "would meet the just

requirements of the general welfare of the people."

As pointed out earlier, the Respondents have adequately explained the

delay, if any, attributed to the acquisition process and therefore, I find that the

Petitioner has not satisfied Court that there was no urgency to act under proviso (a)

to Section 38.

The next question is whether the Respondents should utilize the already

existing reservation over Robert Gunerwardene Mawatha.

9

The Petitioner submits that when there is an existing reservation allowing

an extension to the Base Line Road to be implemented, the authorities are

proceeding with their plan to extend the road project over De Costa Gardens

without any "plausible reason being given." In support, the Petitioner has drawn

attention of Court to the survey plan marked PII, PII(a) which depicts a 100 feet

reservation on Robert Gunerwardena Mawatha and "the comparison of the two

proposed corridors" marked 6R2, emphasizing the reduced cost factor, in the

alternate route.

The 5th and the 6th Respondents in their statements of objections and the

affidavits filed of record have extensively dealt with the above issue. A

comparison of the alternate route has been submitted to Court, marked 4R7, where

the following material has been placed in support of the decision made by the

authorities, that the;

a. existing road reservation on Robert Gunerwardena Mawatha is limited as

shown in paragraph 6.1 in document marked 6R2, which ends abruptly at

Balapokuna Road;

b. alternative road proposed by the Petitioner along the road reservation on

Robert Gunerwardena Mawatha requires an unsafe diversion of vehicular

traffic from the direction of the proposed path of the road;

c. importance of the geometry of the Road and safety on its design should be

considered;

10

d. failure to substantiate that the alternate route proposed by the Petitioner is

most suitable for a highway or to propose any costs benefit analysis of the

two routes;

and concludes that the extension project through De Costa Gardens is technically

and environmentally more feasible.

The Court observes the reasons given for such conclusion, based on the

damage to property and resettlement of displaced persons, the length of the road,

construction and vehicle operating costs and the Vertical Alignment of the road,

among other considerations reflected in the document marked 7R3.

In relation to "the costs benefit", Lewis on "Judicial Remedies in Public

Law" 5th Edition, states at page 287, that-

"More significantly, the public interest frequently cannot be measured in

terms offinancial consequences. --- the courts will be placed in the difficult

position of trying to place a value on the public interest and balancing that

against the financial or other consequences suffered by the individual. ---

In Amerasinghe Vs. The Attorney General (Supra), the court held,

"-- it is not for the court to determine whether, upon the consideration of

all these factors, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of the

expressway, or whether in its view the expressway meets the just

requirements of the general welfare of the people. There is adequate

material to show that these factors have been considered and will be

considered further in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions. --"

11

It is not only the Petitioners land but lands belonging to several other

residents have been earmarked to be acquired. The Petitioner has not been denied

of the opportunity of having his objections in the matter considered. It appears that

the authorities have considered all necessary factors before deciding on the

proposed route and selecting the lands for acquisition. The need for a public

purpose and the urgency in acquisition of the proposed land is evident on the

material placed before Court. Accordingly, the Court is of the view that there is

no basis to conclude that the relevant authorities acted ultra vires in deciding to

take possession of the land of the Petitioner in terms of proviso (a) of Section 38

of the Land Acquisition Act, as challenged.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.

Parties in C.A. (Writ) 415/2015, C.A. (Writ) 416/2015, C.A. (Writ)

417/2015, C.A. (Writ) 433/2015, C.A. (Writ) 188/2016 have agreed to abide by

the Judgment delivered in this case.
