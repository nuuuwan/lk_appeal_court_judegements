Plaintiff-Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Anuruddha Dharmaratne for the Substituted

Defendant-Appellant.

Navin Marapana for the 6th Plaintiff-Respondent.

Decided on: 01.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The defendant-appellant filed this appeal against the Judgment

of the District Court of Ratnapura dated 17.02.2000. At the

stage of preparing and collecting the Appeal Briefs, as seen from

the Journal Entry dated 14.03.2012, the learned counsel

appearing for the 1A plaintiff-respondent, has informed Court

that the name of the 1A plaintiff-respondent does not appear in

the Notice of Appeal and therefore the Notice of Appeal is invalid.

Thereafter, the registered Attorney for the appellant, by way of a

petition and affidavit dated 01.04.2013 has moved Court, with

notice to the registered Attorney of the plaintiff-respondents, to

accept the amended caption, which included the parties

substituted in the District Court in place of the deceased 1st and

3rd plaintiffs. This has been objected to by the learned counsel

for the 6th plaintiff-respondent, who moves to dismiss the appeal

in limine, on the basis that the substituted plaintiffs in place of

the deceased 1st and 3rd plaintiffs have not been named as

parties to the Appeal. Hence this order.

4

There had been six original plaintiffs, and for all of them, there

had been one registered Attorney. Pending trial in the District

Court, the 4th, the 1st and the 3rd plaintiffs have passed away,

respectively, at regular intervals, and substitutions have been

effected; and the same registered Attorney for the plaintiffs has

filed proxies on behalf of the substituted plaintiffs as well.

It is the explanation of the learned counsel for the appellant

that, although substitutions have been so made, the registered

Attorney for the plaintiffs have not filed amended captions, and

that has led to the present fiasco.

The action has been instituted as far back as in 1980, and

thereafter plaint has been amended at least three times. By the

time the second amended plaint was tendered in 1983, although

the 4th plaintiff was dead and substitutions were effected, the

caption of the amended plaint does not reflect it.1 That is

reflected only in the third amended plaint filed in 1984. The 1st

and 3rd plaintiffs have died and substitutions were made

thereafter, and no amended captions have been filed by the

registered Attorney for the plaintiff reflecting such substitutions.

The Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal are based on the

caption of the last amended plaint. Therefore, in my view, the

registered Attorney for the plaintiffs is also responsible for the

present predicament.

As I said earlier, the same registered Attorney for all the original

six plaintiffs has filed proxies for all the substituted plaintiffs as

well, and the said registered Attorney has also accepted a copy

1 Vide page 71 of the Appeal Brief.

5

of the Notice of Appeal without a murmur.2 Therefore there

cannot be any dispute that the registered Attorney for the

plaintiffs was well aware of the Appeal, and in fact, sent a

counsel to represent the 1A plaintiff in this Court despite her

(the 1A plaintiff) name not appearing in the Notice of Appeal and

the Petition of Appeal.3 This clearly goes to show that no

prejudice whatsoever has been caused to the substituted

plaintiffs for the failure to name the substituted 1st and 3rd

plaintiffs in the Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal.

The learned counsel for the 6th plaintiff-respondents has cited

several authorities to say that failure to name the proper parties

in the Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal warrants

dismissal of the appeal in limine.

Nevertheless, the trend of authority in later cases has been to

interpret the relevant provisions of law liberally as opposed to

restrictively allowing the defaulting party to cure the defect, if

any, and dispose of the appeal on merits, as opposed to on high

technical grounds, unless the defect has caused material

prejudice to the other party, in which event the Court can

dismiss the appeal ab initio.

Sections 755(1) and 758(1) of the Civil Procedure Code spell out

the particulars to be included in the Notice of Appeal and the

Petition of Appeal respectively, and one such requirement is to

name the parties to the action in them.

Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads thus: In the

case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing

sections (other than a provision specifying the period within which

any act or thing is to be done), the Court of Appeal may, if it

should be of opinion that the respondent has not been materially

prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it may deem just.

It must be noted that, as Justice Kulatunga remarked in Martin

v. Suduhamy [1991] 2 Sri LR 279 at 306 and Chief Justice G.P.S.

de Silva stressed in Keerthisiri v. Weerasena [1997] 1 Sri LR 70 at

74, the phrase used in section 759(2) is not mere prejudice but

material prejudice.

As was held by the Supreme Court in Nanayakkara v.

Warnakulasooriya [1993] 2 Sri LR 289: The power of the court to

grant relief under Section 759(2) of the Code is wide and

discretionary and is subject to such terms as the Court may deem

just. Relief may be granted even if no excuse for non-compliance

is forthcoming. However, relief cannot be granted if the Court is of

opinion that the respondent has been materially prejudiced in

which event the appeal has to be dismissed. In the same case

at page 293, Justice Kulatunga (with the agreement of Chief

Justice G.P.S. de Silva and Justice Wijetunga) further added

that: In an application for relief under section 759(2), the rule

that the negligence of the Attorney-at-Law is the negligence of the

client does not apply.

In the Supreme Court case of Jayasekera v. Lakmini [2010] 1 Sri

LR 41 both the Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal were

7

not in conformity with the provisions of sections 755(1) and

758(1) of the Civil Procedure Code inter alia by not making all

the defendants parties to the Appeal. On the preliminary

objection taken on that ground, Justice Ekanayake (with Chief

Justice Asoka de Silva and Justice Marsoof agreeing) held that

those lapses can be rectified in terms of section 759(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code since it has not caused material prejudice

to the other parties.

Justice Ekanayake further held that section 770 of the Civil

Procedure Code can also be made use of by the Appellate Court

when granting such relief to a defaulting appellant.

That section reads as follows: If, at the hearing of the appeal, the

respondent is not present and the court is not satisfied upon the

material in the record or upon other evidence that the notice of

appeal was duly served upon him or his registered attorney as

hereinbefore provided, or if it appears to the court at such hearing

that any person who was a party to the action in the court against

whose decree the appeal is made, but who has not been made a

party to the appeal, is interested in the result of the appeal, the

court may issue the requisite notice of appeal for service.

When pointed out by counsel for the respondent that no such

application invoking the provisions of section 759 had been

made for the Appellate Court to grant such relief to the

defaulting appellant, the Supreme Court at page 51 went so far

as to say that "it is undoubtedly incumbent upon the court to

utilize the statutory provisions and grant the relief embodied

therein if it appears to court that it is just and fair to do so."

8

The ratio in Jayasekera v. Lakmini (supra) has consistently been

followed by later Supreme Court Judgements.

In Wilson v. Kusumawathi [2015] BLR 49, Justice Sisira de

Abrew (with Justice Marsoof and Justice Sarath de Abrew

agreeing), citing with approval Jayasekera v. Lakmini, held that

failure to name all the parties in the Petition of Appeal is a

curable defect in terms of section 759 of the Civil Procedure

Code, so long as no material prejudice has been caused to the

respondents.

In Premaratna v. Sunil Pathirana (SC Appeal 49/2012 decided on

27.03.2015), Justice Wanasundera (with Justice Aluwihare and

Justice Abeyratne concurring), citing inter alia Jayasekera v.

Lakmini, held that:

The Petition of Appeal had not contained in the caption, the name

of the substituted parties. I feel that, the mere fact that only the

name of the dead person was mentioned in the caption, cannot be

held against the party seeking relief from Court. It is a lapse on

the part of the petitioners Attorney-at-Law. The litigant who has

come before Court for relief should not be deprived of his right to

seek relief due to a lapse on the part of the lawyers preparing and

filing the papers. In the case in hand, the dead person has been

substituted promptly in the District Court and named as 1A and

1B defendants. It is only a lapse of not writing down the caption

properly. I am of the view that this is a matter which should have

been corrected by the High Court Judges as provided for in

section 759(1) and (2). It is not an incorrigible defect, good enough

for rejecting the Petition of Appeal.

9

The learned counsel for the 6th defendant-respondent says that

the last Judgment cited above has no binding effect on this

Court as it is per incuriam in view of the Five Bench Judgment of

the Supreme Court in Jeyaraj Fernandopulle v. Premachandra de

Silva [1996] 1 Sri LR 70 where it has been held that: The court

will treat as a nullity and set aside, of its own motion if

necessary, a judgment entered against a person who was in fact

dead or a non-existent company or, in certain circumstances, a

judgment in default or a consent judgment. Where there has been

some procedural irregularity in the proceedings leading up to the

judgment or order which is so serious that the judgment or order

ought to be treated as a nullity, the Court will set it aside. I am

unable to agree. Firstly, as seen from page 105 of the said

Judgment, that is only a citation from Halsbury, Vol.26,

Paragraph 556. Secondly, it speaks of Judgments entered

against persons who were dead at that time. Here no such

situation has arisen. The Judgment has not been entered

against a dead party. The main appeal has not, at least, been

taken up for argument yet.

In the instant case, as I stated earlier, no prejudice has been

caused to the 6th plaintiff-respondent by not naming the

substituted 1st and 3rd plaintiff-respondents as parties to the

Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal.

The amended caption which has been filed with notice to the

registered Attorney of the plaintiff-respondents with the petition

and affidavit dated 01.04.2013 is accepted.

10

The preliminary objection is overruled subject to costs in a sum

of Rs.25,000/= payable by the 6th plaintiff-respondent to the

substituted defendant-appellant.

Counsel for both parties move to fix the main appeal for

argument for 22.02.2019.

Before I part with this order, I must mention that the 6th

defendant-respondent in his statement of objections tendering a

document marked A, has stated that the 2nd plaintiff also died

pending appeal. However, that document is not a copy of the

Death Certificate of the 2nd plaintiff. If the 2nd defendant is in

fact dead, the registered Attorney for the 6th plaintiff-respondent

shall, with a copy to the registered Attorney for the appellant,

tender a copy of the Death Certificate together with a name of a

person who can be substituted in his place, within one month

from today, for the limited purpose of prosecuting this appeal.

Court will appreciate if the proxy of the party to be substituted

can also be tendered to avoid formalities as this is a simple

declaration of title action filed more than 38 years ago in July

1980.
