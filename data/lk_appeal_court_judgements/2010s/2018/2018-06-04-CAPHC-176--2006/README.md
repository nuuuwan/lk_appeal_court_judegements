Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgement of the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden

in Rathnapura dated 8th June 2006.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) is a vendor engaged in the retail sale of fish at stall nos. 9

and 10 at the 8alangoda public market. He was earlier occupying stall nos. 3 and 4 at the said

public market from 1971 and 1969 respectively on lease agreements and in 1979 consequent to

improvements made to the said public market he occupied stall nos. 9 and 10. The Appellant

claimed that there was animosity between the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd Respondent) and

the Appellant due to a complaint he lodged against the 2nd Respondent over an attempt to charge

for the water supplied to fish staib at the said public market when other stalls like vegetablE: stalls

were not to be charged. The Appellant claimed that the decision not to charge for the water

supplied to other stalls like vegetable stalls was due to the father of the 2nd Respondent himself

3

been a vegetable seller at the said market. Ultimately no charge was imposed on the water used

by the meat and fish stalls.

The Appellant submitted that due to this animosity the 2nd Respondent initiated a process

whereby tenders were called for several stalls at the [!;::Iangoda public market including the fish

stalls he was occupying except the vegetable stalls. The Appellant states that he submitted a

tender for the fish stalls he was occupying (although at times he claims that his two sons

submitted a tender) but the tender was awarded to the 6th Respondent-Respondent (6th

Respondent).

The Appellant thereafter filed an application in the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province

holden in Rathnapura and sought, inter alia, the following relief:

(a) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st, 2nd

and Respondents to call for tenders in respect of stall nos. 9 and 10 at the Balangoda

public market and the notice of the 1st Respondent calling for tenders in respect of the

s~id stalls (P9).

(b) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 5th

Respondent to call tenders in respect of stall nos. 9 and 10at the Balangoda public market

as contained in letters P10 and P14;

(c) Make order quashing the decision of the 1st and or the second respondent to award the

tender in respect of the stall nos. 9 and 10 at the Balangoda public market to the 6th

Respondent for the year 2000;

(d) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus compelling the respondents to

extend the validity of the lease granted to the Appellant to engage in the sale of fish at

stall nos. 9 and 10 at the Balangoda public market upon payment of the annual lease

rental.

The main ground urged on behalf of the Appellant to impugn the decision to call for tenders is

that in terms of Local Government Circular No. 1980/46 dated 31.12.1980 (Pll) tenders could

have been called in respect of stalls being currently operated only when the stall becomes vacant

which was not the case in the instant case. The Appellant submitted that he was operating his

fish stalls and as such no tenders could have been called for those stalls.

The position of the 1st to 3rd Respondents-Respondents (pt to 3rd Respondents) is that the Local

Government Circular No. 1980/46 dated 31.12.1980 (Pll) is prior to the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution and that the subject of Local Government is included in the 9th Schedule and

therefore the 5th Respondent-Respondent has the power to exercise his rights with regard to any

decision concerning Local Government according to law. It was submitted that approval from the

5th Respondent-Respondent was granted by P14 to call for tenders for the fish stalls.

The learned High Court judge held that the Appellant had acted in bad faith in challenging the

decision to call for tenders after he himself took part in the impugned tender proceedings and

failed to secure the tender.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents-Respondents ("pt to 3rd

Respondents") submitted that the relationship between the Appellant and the pt Respondent-

Respondent the 8alangoda Urban Council was contractual in nature and that the Appellant was

not entitled to the remedies sought by way of writs of certiorari. He relied on the decision in Podi

Nona v. Urban Council, Horana1 where the petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to quash a

decision of the local authority cancelling a lease in her favour of a stall at the public market,

Horana. This court held that the petitioner was not entitled to the remedy by way of certiorari as

the relationship between the parties were contractual and that there was another remedy for

the petitioner.

1 (1981) 2 Sri.L.R. 141

However, in th~ instant case, the Appellant is not challenging any decision to cancel the lease

between him and the pt Respondent. He concedes that it had ended and hence the prayer for a

writ of mandamus compelling the Respondents to extend the validity of the leases granted to the

Appellant. He is impugning the decision to call for tf:!nders. There is no contractual relationship

between the parties on that issue and I am of the view that the decision in Podi Nona v. Urban

Council, Horana is irrelevant to the availability of a writ of certiorari.

The Appellant is not impugning the validity of circular marked Pll. His contention is that the

procedure specified therein was not followed in the instant case. It is not in dispute that the

Appellant did, either by himself or through his sons, submit a tender when tenders were called.

It is only when he was unsuccessful did he seek to impugn the tender process.

In Jayaweera vs. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Ratnapura and another2 Jayasuriya J.

stated as follows:

"A petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having

regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief."

An individual who has acquiesced in a decision may not be granted a remedy if he subsequently

seeks to challenge it.3 However, acquiescence is relevant only where there is a latent lack of

jurisdiction. No amount of waiver or acquiescence can validate a decision where there is a patent

lack of jurisdiction. In Beatrice Perera v. The Commissioner of National Housing4 Tennakoon c.J.

explained the difference in the following terms:

"Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance that results in a judgment or order that

is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction

C'!2i ~he cause or matter or over the parties; it may al~a lack competence because of

failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of

2 (1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 70

3 Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed., 415 477 N.L.R. 361

6

power by the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is

commonly known in the law as a 'patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a delectus

jurisdiction is and the second a 'latent' or 'contingent' want of jurisdiction or a delectus

triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are

void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class of case where the want

of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of

jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer

jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to

litigation to create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits,

both of which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases

within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable. In the

other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or

order of the Court will be void only against the party on whom it operates but

acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may estop him from making

or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that the Court was

lacking in contingent jurisdiction.s

I am of the view that the matters urged on behalf of the Appellant do not raise a patent lack of

jurisdiction. The main ground urged on behalf of the Appellant is that tenders could not have

been called as the Appellant was in occupation of the relevant stalls and that they were not

vacant as required by the relevant circular. This is an issue that goes to latent lack of jurisdiction

and can be cured by waiver or acquiescence as was done when the Appellant, either directly or

through his sons, tendered for the tender process.

In Pradeshiya Sabhawa, Hingurakgoda and Others v. Karunaratne and others6 The 1st and 2nd

petitioners - respondents filed an application for writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in the High

Court pleading that the Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha acted contrary to law in selecting lessees

for the shops a1.: Hingurakgoda. The High Court issued a writ quashing the selections and iS~l!ed

Writ of Mandamus compelling the Pradeshiya Saba to make the selections according to the

5 Ybid. page 366

tender procedure. In appeal, the Court of Appeal held that as the petitioner - respondents admit

that they made- an application and participated at the interview but were not selected, the

petitioner- respondents having accepted the selection criteria are not entitled to claim that the

method of selection is invalid. It was further held that they cannot challenge the method of

selection by way of writ of mandamus directing a new method of selection.

The question of granting a writ of mandamus as prayed for by the Appellant does not arise since,

for the reasons set out above, he is not entitled to a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of

the 1st and or the second respondent to award the tender in respect of the stall nos. 9 and 10 at

the Balangoda public market to the 6th Respondent for the year 2000.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Rathnapura dated 8th

June 2006.

Accordingly, I dismiss this appeal with costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

K.K. Wickremasinghe J.
