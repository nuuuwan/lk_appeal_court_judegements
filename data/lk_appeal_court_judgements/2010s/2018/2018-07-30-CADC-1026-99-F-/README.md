DECIDED ON 26.07.2018

M.M.A. GAFFOOR J

The plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff-

appellant) instituted this action on or around August 1996 against

the defendant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

respondents) seeking inter alia for a declaration of title to the

property described in the schedule to the plaint and to eject the

respondents and all those persons holding under the deceased

respondents from the said property.

The appellant claims that he is the owner of the 10 acres land

called Pelangahawatta and Dewatagahawatta by virtue of Deed

No.1333 dated 27.03.1961. The appellant divided the said land into

several allotments by Plan No.614 dated 08.04.1962. After dividing

the said land, the appellant entrusted the "House and Property

Trades" Company with the sale of the sub divided lots (by word of

mouth and no documentary evidence has been produced at the trial

or no witness called for HPT). The HPT sold Lot No.14 (in the Plan

No.614) to the 1st respondent (deceased) and the deed has been

executed. The 1 st and the 2nd respondents were husband and wife.

3

(now deceased) Thereafter, 2nd respondent paid an advance payment

of Rs.400j- on 27.02.1963 to purchase Lot No. 15 and further paid

Rs.1340 j - on 11. 03 .1963 to the HPT (photocopies of the receipts

issued by the HPT marked as V2 and V3.) The 1st respondent stated

in his evidence that the 2nd respondent (his wife) settled the due

amount of Rs.1260j- during that period and he couldn't remember

the exact date.

He further added that the HPT has refused to issue a receipt for that

last payment.

The subject matter of this action is the sale of Lot No.15 of the said

Plan No.614 to the 2nd respondent. The respondents entered into the

possession of the questioned land plot (Lot 15) in 1963. Until 1993

they possessed the said land on their own. But the respondents

4

couldn't obtain a deed for Lot No.15. The appellant registered a

Caveat for Lot No.15 in the Land Registry of Colombo on 24.12.1993.

Issue No.1

Applicability of plea of Res Judicata

The appellant had instituted a boundary action against the

respondent in the DC. Mt. Lavinia case numbers bearing 390/95/L

and 391/95/L. Proceedings of 390/95/L is only available in the

brief. Nothing in 391/95/L.

Pg.50 "391195/L 2)c.:l25) 25)~0e) ~e;)@) C) q@z53@ 2)c.:lJ 2)c.:lm0m. 0 25)~Dc) q~JC

The appellant claimed the title of the said land described in the 2nd

schedule to the plaint (AO, R3, P35) and right of the way to the said

land in the aforementioned action. Pg.110-111.

Pg.110 "2 D25) Ca0C@25)0cl lflz53 ~e;)0@) q@z532:;5)~ al'&CC @DC) 92:;5)Jad 2:;5)625)

The judgment dated 24.07.1996 that the learned District Judge

decided the said matter 390/95/L in favour of the respondent and

5

dismissed the application with cost. Pg.117. The learned District

Judge observed in his judgment that the respondent acquired a

prescriptive title to the said land and stated as "5d:5325)~C) q~D @

qD63o,-, 25)0 :53~@.a 1963 D~t;@d ~'-'. 5d:532$)~ @ c3}@ @25)JC)~C) l{ 25)JCJD@od'C3

Therefore, the learned District Judge dismissed the said action

390/95/L due to non-compliance with the provisions set out in

Section 40(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellant didn't

appeal against the said judgment. But he has instituted the original

action 673/96 /P in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia on 19.08.1996.

That the respondents raised a plea of Res Judicata in its answer

dated 21.03.1997 stating that the matter in issue in Case

NO.391/95/L and the original court action is almost identical in

nature although the purported relief claimed are slightly different

from each other. Therefore, 391/95/L operates as Res Judicata

against the original court action filed by the appellant against the

respondent relating to the same property and among same parties.

Schedule of the boundary Case No.390/95/L and the partition

matter 673/96/P are different in content. But the questioned Lot

No.15 is the same. Land action 390/95/L dismissed due to a

6

technical error. Respondents raised the plea of res judicata as the

determining Issue No.16. That the respondents had failed to

produce evidence of the questioned Case N 0.391/95/ L at the District

court trial, they cannot take a plea of Res Judicata. Therefore, Plea

of Res Judicata has no application in this matter.

The burden of proving shifts to the party who claims the plea of Res

Judicata. But the respondents had failed to produce evidence of

391/95/L at the trial but only produced evidence of 390/95/1.

Therefore, that the learned District Judge stated in her judgment

that the respondents had failed to prove the plea of Res Judicata.

Pg.73. Therefore, Res Judicata has no application in this action.

Relevant case laws;

Rev. Moragolle Sumangala v. Rev. Kiribamune Piyadassi -NLR

[1955] 322 of 56

Two important tests must be applied whenever a plea of res judicata

is raised:

7

(1) whether the judicial decision in the earlier litigation was, or at

least involved, a determination of the same question as that

sought to be controverted in the later litigation in which the

estoppel is raised, and, if so,

(2) whether the parties to the later litigation are the parties or the

privies of the parties to the earlier decision.

Issue No.2

Whether the respondents can claim the prescriptive title against the appellant to the questioned land plot (Lot No. IS)

The respondents came into the possession of the said land (Lot

No.IS) in 1963 and possessed it undisturbed and uninterrupted

until 1993. That the respondents bona fide believed that they owned

the said portion of land. That the HPT functioned as an agent of the

appellant regarding the sale of the land and no documentary proof

was produced at the trial. But both parties (the appellant and the

respondents) admitted the fact/issue at the commencement of the

trial. The respondents do not know about the original owner of the

said land until he came out suddenly and claimed his title in 1993

when the financial crisis starts in HPT. The appellant testified that

he knew that the HPT sold that Lot No.IS to the respondents.

The appellant stated in his plaint dated 19.08.1996 that the

respondents had failed to settle the full amount of the value of the

questioned land as the ownership/title was not transferred to the

respondents. (Pg.19) The appellant further stated in his plaint that

the respondents had built a fence preventing the entrance to the

questioned land for a period of 5 years and they are forcibly

occupying in the said Lot. 15 (Issues No.8 and 10 of the said Plaint.

Pg.19) But the appellant or HPT never take any steps to eject the

respondents from there, even the appellant didn't pay a visit to the

questioned land until 1993.

Considering all the evidence placed before the court that the learned

District Judge stated in her judgment dated 15.07.99 that the

respondents had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession in the

said land since 1963.

Prescription in the law refers to either acquisitive prescription

or extinctive prescription. Acquisitive prescription refers to the

acquisition of ownership in property belonging to another by the

simple fact of long continued possession. Extinctive prescription

refers to the extinction of legal rights by the lapse of specified period

10

of time. Though a person has been in undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession of the land and has satisfied the terms of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in all respect, and considers

himself to have acquired ownership of the land by prescription. And

that the person must wait till his possession is threatened or

interrupted by a third party and then institute an action in court

against such third party and get a declaration by the Court that he

has acquired a title by prescription. When a person has a deed or

document of title as an owner, he is presumed to have had

possession of the land. The onus is therefore on the person who

claims a prescriptive title against such owner to prove by evidence

that the person who has the documentary title as owner had no

possession fact. It was held in the case of Perera v. Pemawathie

74 NLR 302-

The question was whether A, who claimed title to the land under an

unregistered deed, had acquired prescriptive title as against B who

claimed that land under a subsequent deed which had been duly

registered. The Court held the onus was on A to prove that he had

acquired a prescriptive title.

Karunadasa v. Abdul Hameed 60 NLR 352

In Alwis v. Perera NLR [1919] 321 of 21

Where a person transferred MB lands to certain family connections,

but continued in possession till date of action (sixty years), the

11

Supreme Court held (in the circumstances) that the possession was

not permissive, but that it should be presumed to have become

adverse,

In Tillekeratne v. Bastian [(1918) 21 NLR 12] followed.

Semble, even apart from this presumption, a vendor, who after sale

remain~ in possession, should be considered as possessing adversely

to the purchaser.

In Sirajudeen and Two Others v. Abbas - SLR 365, Vol. 2 of 1994

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general

statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed that land in

dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are

not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary

to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses

should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to

be decided thereupon by Court. One of the essential elements of the

plea of prescriptive title as provided for in Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of

the premises must be of such character as it incompatible with the

title of the owner.

In Siman Appu v. Christian Appu NLR [1895] 288 of 1

Withers, J - "Possession" of a land must be continuous, peaceful and

for a certain period.

12

Possession is interrupted if the continuity of possession is broken by

the disputant legitimately putting the possessor out of the land and

keeping him out of it for a certain time, if the possessor is occupying

it; or by occupying it himself for a certain time and using it for his

own advantage, if the party prescribing is not in occupation.

In Jane Nona v. Gunawardene NLR [1948] 522 of 49

Appellant mortgaged an undivided half share of a field which was

sold in execution and purchased by M. Order for delivery of

possession was issued and the Fiscal reported that he was unable to

trace the co-owners and that the purchaser failed to attend to receive

possession. The Fiscal then purported to act under Section 288 of

the Civil Procedure Code and deliver possession to the purchaser.

Appellant continued in possession of the field.

Held,

(i) that a judgment debtor who continues in adverse possession after

a sale in execution can acquire title by prescription;

(ii) that symbolical possession by a purchaser at a court sale is not

interruption of such possession. There must be an interruption

of actual physical possession.

In Lucia Perera v. Martin Perera Et Al- NLR [1951] 347 of 53

A bought an undivided one-fourth share in a land at the request of

his daughter

13

B who had paid the purchase price, but, contrary to his mandate,

he obtained from the vendor a conveyance in which A, and not B,

was named as the purchaser. Shortly thereafter, B, under the

belief that she was the absolute owner, went into occupation of a

divided allotment which represented the undivided share and

remained in occupation of it for over 19 years on the basis that

she was entitled to possession in her own right. During that

period A, whenever he was requested by B to execute a fresh

conveyance in her favour, promised to do so. Subsequently,

however, A, without the knowledge of B, conveyed the one-fourth

share to C who was, in fact, a bona fide purchaser for value

without notice of the trust.

Hel~, that B had acquired prescriptive title to the land before the

date on which the share was conveyed to C and, therefore, her

rights were completely protected. The requests of B that A should

give her a conveyance of the property did not constitute an

acknowledgment of A's rights so as to interrupt B's possession

un dominus.

Considering the aforementioned evidence, it is evident that the

respondents acquired a prescriptive title under Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the

learned District Judge. For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss this

appeal with costs.
