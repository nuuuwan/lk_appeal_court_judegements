Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Rohan Sahabandu, P.C., for the Petitioner.

Chandana Wijesooriya for the 3A-3F Defendant-

Respondents.

Argued &

Decided on: 23.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. After trial the Judgment has been

pronounced and the Interlocutory Decree has been entered. The

application of the 3rd defendant to amend the Interlocutory

Decree has been refused by the District Court and the revision

application filed against that order has been dismissed by this

Court. After the original case record was sent by this Court to

the District Court, the original case record has gone missing

from the District Court. Thereafter the Criminal Investigation

Bureau has taken over the investigation into the missing case

record.

In the meantime, the plaintiff has died and the petitioner to the

present application as the daughter of the deceased has made

an application to substitute her in place of the plaintiff and then

to confirm the Final Partition Plan and order delivery of

possession of the allotments of land in terms of the Final Decree.

The third defendant has objected to these applications

predominantly on the basis that without the original case record

containing all the relevant documents, the Court cannot allow

those applications.

The District Court has upheld that objection and dismissed the

said applications by orders dated 21.06.2001 and 13.01.2003.

It is these two orders the petitioner is seeking to set aside by

filing this revision application.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and learned

Counsel for the 3rd respondent state that the District Court has

now found the original case record.

In the circumstances, I pro forma set aside those two orders of

the District Court and direct the learned District Judge to take

appropriate steps in accordance with law to conclude this case

expeditiously.

In that process, the learned District Judge shall bear in mind

that the plaintiff shall not be made to suffer for the lapses on the

part of the Court of which he has no control. It is the duty of

the Court and not that of the plaintiff to zealously preserve the

original case record.

Obviously, the legislature cannot anticipate and make provisions

to cover all possible contingencies (such as making provisions in

the event a case record is made to disappear from the Court

custodywhich was what happened in this case). There is no

express provision found in the Civil Procedure Code, which is

not exhaustive, to deal with such a situation. In such a

contingency, it lies within the inherent powers of the Court to

make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or

to prevent abuse of the process of Courtvide section 839 of the

Civil Procedure Code. (Leechman & Company Ltd. v. Rangalla

Application of the petitioner is allowed with costs.
