BEFORE A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J.

COUNSEL Jeevani Perera for the Defendant'Appellants

P. Peramunugama for the Plaintiff,Respondent

Decided on 01.06.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

his is a case which raises the question whether the Plaintiff, Respondent in this

case (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff') has established one of

the requisites of a vindicatory action namely title to the land he claimed in his plaint

dated 31.07.1991. The Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Badulla

against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendant,Appellants (hereinafter referred to as "the

Defendants") praying for, inter alia,

a) for an order that the Plaintiff is entitled to right of possession and ownership of

the property set out in the Schedule to the Plaint;

b) for ejectment of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants, their servants, agents and all those

who were holding under them;

c) for damages.

It was through an annual permit dated 24.11.1989 that the Plaintiff was permitted to

occupy and develop a land morefully described in the schedule to the plaint' see PI

marked at the trial (page 120 of the appeal brief). It is through this annual permit that

the Plaintiff derived title to the subject,matter of this action.

If one peruses the permit of the Plaintiff which was marked as PI at the trial, PI had

conveyed to the Plaintiff an extent of land in 2 Roods and 28 perches. This tallies with

Lot B in Plan No. 8 lA, whose extent is depicted as 2 Roods and 28 perches in the said

plan. It was the testimony of Surveyor Dissanayake that the boundaries of Lot B in Plan

No. 8lA tallies with the all four boundaries shown in his Plan bearing No. 430, which

2

was marked as X in the trial. The said surveyor further testified that what are shown as

Lot 1 and 2 in his Plan bearing No. 430 constitute Lot B in Plan No.8 lA, which the

Plaintiff has claimed in this case. Though there is no doubt that the Plaintiff has

established the boundaries of his land, the question is whether he has established his

title.

The Counsel for the Defendant~Appellants submitted that the Plaintiff's case is

premised on an annual permit which was renewable each year and it had been issued in

November 1989 in terms of Section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance No.6 of 1947. The

permit, which was issued in 1989 and marked at the trial as PI, laid down the condition

that it was valid only up to the end of 1989 unless and until it was renewed. In fact, it

was the evidence of the Plaintiff that the permit had been extended till 31.12.1993 and

since then the extension of the permit was not effected. The testimony of the Plaintiff

quite clearly establishes that the permit was not extended beyond 31.12.1993~see the

evidence of the Plaintiff under cross~examination on 24.04.1995.

As would appear this is a rei vindicatio action based on a permit issued by the State and

there is no doubt that the dictum of Gratiaen,J. in D.P. Palisena v. KKD. Pererd that

a permit~holder under the Land Development Ordinance enjoys a sufficient title to

enable him to maintain a vindicatory action against a trespasser holds good in this case

as well. This dictum was adopted with approval by Somawansa, J. (with Dissanayake,

J. agreeing) in Bandaranayake v. Karunawathie2. It was the submission of the Counsel

for the Defendant~Appellants that as the Plaintiff had not extended the permit beyond

31.12.1993, he couldn't have had and maintained this action. In other words, when the

plaint was filed on 31.07.1991, the argument was that the Plaintiff might have had title

by virtue of the permit but during the pendency of the action the permit had expired. In

fact, the trial itself concluded on 01.06.1999 and the judgment was pronounced on

06.11.2000. Long before the trial concluded in the District Court of Badulla, the permit

2 (2003) 3 Sri L.R 295 at p 297 3

by virtue of which the Plaintiff had dominium over the subject-matter of the action had

outlived its validity.

So this case raises the fundamental question. Provided that the Plaintiff had sufficient

title to vindicate by virtue of his permit on 31.07.1991 (the date of the plaint), it would

appear that he lost his title after 31.12.1993, long before the trial in the District Court

ended. Could such a Plaintiff continue with his rei vindicatio action?

Rights of the parties must be determined as at the time of institution of action

The Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent has drawn the attention of this Court to the

well-known principle that rights of the parties should be determined as at the date of

the institution of action. In fact there is a long line of cases that have established this

principle and I had occasion to allude to the catena of precedents in an appeal from the

District Court of Kandy namely Upali Palitha Mahanama v. Wijayhenagedara

Sumanawathie bearing No. CALA 203/2002 (CA minutes of 25.05.2018), which

incidentally offered an opportunity to Court to create an exception to the long held

principle. To my mind the general principle appears to have been enunciated in Silva v.

Nona Hamintf and articulated since then in a slew of cases such as Silva v. Fernando4;

Sherieff v. Marikkar; Eminona v. Mohideen6; Lenorahamy v. Abraham7; Kader

Mohideen &' Co. Ltd, v. Nagoor Gan/; Sirisena v. Doreen de Silva and Otherl;

HNB v. Silva10 andJayaratne v.JayaratneandAnotherll.

Mr. Peramunagama the Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent submitted that at the

time the plaint was filed in this case on 31.07.1991, the Plaintiff had title and therefore

he could have and maintain this action up to the end.

I am afraid I cannot help but disagree with this submission. Not only must the Plaintiff

have title at the time the rei vindicatio is instituted, but he must retain title throughout

the course of the action.

Voet states the principle thus: "If he who brought the action was the dominus at the time

of the institution of the suit, but lite pendente has lost the dominium, reason dictates that

the defendant should be absolved both because the suit has then fallen into that case

from which an action could not have a beginning and in which it could not continue,

and because the interest of the plaintiff in the subject of the suit has ceased to exist,

and in short because the right of dominium has been removed and become extinct, which

was the only foundation of this real action".12

In an appeal from the District Court of Balapitiya Silva v.Jayawardena13, Keuneman,J.

(with Soertsz, J. agreeing) stated that where, after the institution of an action for

declaration of title to five blocks of land, the Plaintiff transferred three blocks, no

decree for title can be entered in respect of the blocks sold. This establishes another

exception to the rule~rights of the parties must be decided as at the time of the

institution of action. The exception is that that if a party loses title during the

pendency of a rei vindicatio action, he cannot secure and enjoy the fruits of a judgment in

respect of the subject~matter. Owing to the defeasance of title pendente lite, no judgment

can be pronounced in favour of the Plaintiff.

Keuneman, J. said: "It is clear that the action contemplated by Voet was the action rei

vindicatio, and I think it follows that all rights in rem against the property are lost, when

the dominium has been transferred pending the action to another person".14

Elisahamy v. Punchi Band;P was a case where, during the pendency of an action for

declaration of title, ejectment and damages consequent on trespass and the wrongful

removal of plumbago from the land in dispute, the Plaintiff sold the land to a third

party. Hutchinson C]. and Middleton]. (with Grenier]. dissenting) were of opinion

that the Plaintiff could not obtain a decree for declaration of title and ejectment.

However, the Plaintiff was allowed to maintain his claim for damages which had

accrued prior to the transfer of title.

In Fernando v. Appuhamy6 the Plaintiff purchased a land subject to a lease in favour

of the Defendant and then sold it to L As the Defendant did not in due time deliver

possession, the Plaintiff brought an action for declaration of title, ejectment and

damages, alleging that L would not pay under the contract of sale until possession was

delivered. Ennis A.C]. (with de Sampayo]. agreeing) held that after the sale to L the

Plaintiff could not maintain the action for declaration of title, but that he was

competent to maintain the action for ejectment and damages .

. In de Silva v. Goonetileke17 an action rei vindicatio was instituted in respect of property

which had vested for non~payment of taxes in the Municipal Council. A Bench of four

Judges comprising Macdonell CJ. and Garvin, Dalton and Akbar JJ. held that the

Plaintiff could not maintain the vindicatory action, even though Plaintiff could not

maintain the vindicatory action, even though the Municipal Council, on being added as

a party, expressed its willingness to transfer the property to the party declared entitled

to it by the Court.

In Silva v. Hendrick AppJ8 Lawrie A.C]. regarded as an established rule of law that:

"When a plaintiff comes into Court praying for a declaration of title, he must possess at

that time the title which he asks the Court to declare to be his". In AhamaduUevve

Kaddubawa v. SanmuganJ9 Gratiaen J. (with Gunasekere J. agreeing) declared: "The

plaintiff's claim fails because he had no title to the property at the time when the action

commenced, and the subsequent title which is alleged to have come into existence after

that date cannot avail him in these proceedings".2o

Thus the decided cases in Sri Lanka are unequivocal in their effect that title, present in

the Plaintiff at the commencement of the vindicatory action, should remain in him until

its termination.

In the appeal before me, the loss of title during the pendency of the action vitiates the

action of the Plaintiff since 1993 and the learned Additional District Judge of Badulla

could not have pronounced his judgment dated 06.11.2000 as the Plaintiff had not

established his title to the land that he sought vindication for. It is apposite to recall the

words of Heart, J. in Wanigaratne v. juwanis Appuhmyl wherein His Lordship

succinctly described the burden of proof in a vindicatory action:-

"In an action rei vindicatio the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He cannot ask for a

declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the defendant's title is poor or not

established. "

In the circumstances I would proceed to set aside the judgment dated 06.11.2000 and

allow the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants.
