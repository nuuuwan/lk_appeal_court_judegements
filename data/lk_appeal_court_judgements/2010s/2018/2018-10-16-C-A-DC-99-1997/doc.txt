This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge of Horana

in respect of a land action bearing case Number 5687/L. The Plaintiff-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant') instituted this action

against the 1st Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the '1 st

Respondent') claiming:

I. A declaration in favour of the Appellant stating that the land more fully

described in the schedule belongs to the Appellant,

II. Eject the 1st Respondent and his Agents, Licensees from the land

described in the schedule to the plaint,

III. An enjoining order against the 1st Respondent restricting him from

damaging and making any changes to the property mentioned in the

schedule of the plaint.

3

According to the Appellant he was continuously in possession of this property

from the year 1976 until the year 1994; and he had made improvements on

the land and had built a house on it. Subsequently on 8th November 1989 he

was granted with a Lease Agreement by the Land Reform Commission

(hereinafter referred to as the 'LRC')

The Appellant further stated that while he was away from the property, the 1 st

Respondent had entered the property by force without conferring any notice

on the Appellant. The 1 st Respondent in his answer dated 26th July 1995, took

up the position, inter alia that,

I. The disputed property belongs to the LRC,

II. The Lease that had been granted to the Appellant has been invalidated

from non-payment of rental,

III. Since the LRC is the owner of the disputed land the same should be

made a party.

Thereafter, the LRC was added as a party to the District Court matter as the

2nd Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the '2nd Respondent').

The 2nd Respondent in its answer dated 23rd November 1995 stated that,

I. The 2nd Respondent is the legal owner of the property.

II. That the disputed land was given to the Appellant on an Annual Lease.

However, the said lease was not extended after a period of one year

due to non-payment of lease rental.

III. That the periodical inspection carried out by the 2nd Respondent, LRC

revealed that the Appellant was not in occupation of the disputed land.

IV. A cause of action has not accrued to the Appellant and the Appellant's

action is not properly constituted.

Further, the 2nd Respondent prayed that,

a) A declaration that 2nd Respondent is the lawful owner of the disputed

land, and

b) Ejectment of the Appellant, and the 1 st Respondent and their agents

from the disputed property.

At the commencement of the District Court Trial the admissions were

recorded. As far as the settling is concerned, leaving out redundant

information, the following admissions would be useful to decide the merit of

the Petition of the Appeal. They are:-

1. That the original owner of the disputed property was the State.

2. There was an Agreement dated 09th November 1989 between the

Appellant and the 2nd Respondent.

After conclusion of the trial, the Learned District Judge delivered his judgment

dated 28th January 1997 dismissing the action of the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment this appeal was filed by the Appellant

praying inter alia to set aside the judgment of the Learned District Judge

dated 28th January 1997.

In this appeal, the Appellant's position is that the Lease Agreement (marked

as P1) is not terminated when the 1 st Respondent forcibly entered in to the

property. To support his stand the Appellant called an official agent on behalf

of the Divisional Secretary as a witness at the trial. And the witness testified

as that the Appellant was in possession of the property, that he possesses

title to the said property and further testified that the Lease Agreement had

not been executed only for a period of one year and that it had not been

terminated. In addition to this witness Grama Niladhari of the area also had

affirmed the fact that the Appellant had been present in the property from

1987 to 1994 and that his name had been registered in the electoral lists.

5

But, the 2nd Respondent's position is that the said Lease Agreement

submitted in evidence has been expired after a period of one year. Therefore,

they argued that the Appellant has to show at least a valid Lease Agreement

for his averment.

Therefore, it's clear that it has no validity and does not convey any valid deed

and legal right to the Appellant to be in possession of the disputed land. I

further observed that the Appellant has failed to establish that the Lease

Agreement was extended and the Lease rentals were paid after said one year

or there was a valid subsisting Lease Agreement after oath November 1990.

Furthermore, considering the evidence presented at the trial there was no

payment after expiration of one year and the Appellant has failed to submit

any evidence to establish that the 2nd Respondent refused to accept any

payment of rentals after one year. Also the 2nd Respondent further argued

that the witness called from the Divisional Secretariat in his evidence admitted

that he proceeded only on the Lease Agreement and there was no deed or

any other valid instrument of disposition from the 2nd Respondent. Therefore,

at this juncture I do not think that the Appellant's claim can be sustained.

In the above circumstances, I wish to deal another question that whether the

Appellant can acquire prescriptive title to the disputed land. In the District

Court, the Appellant had admitted that the ownership of the disputed property

belongs to the State at the beginning of the trial; the prescriptive title cannot

be maintained as no prescription runs against the State. Therefore, the

Appellant's claim cannot be entertained.

The appellant further argued that with the capacity of Lessee he has a right to

bring a vindicatory action to eject the Respondent. It's settle law that the rei

vindicatio action is available to an owner against any person in whose

possession his property found. Rei vindicatio action requires proof that:

6

1. The Plaintiff is the owner of the land.

2. The land is in the possession of the Defendant.

This leads to the following consequences,

a. The burden of establishing title falls on the Plaintiff

b. Once the Plaintiff establishes his title the burden shifts to the

Defendant to prove that he has acquired title to the land.

In R. W. Pathirana vs. R. E. De. S. Jayasundara 58 NLR 169, Gratiaen, J.

stated that:

... In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery of

the property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful occupation.

'The Plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the very essence of the

action" (Maasdorp's Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96)

(page at 173)

Now the question is that a lessee under a Lease Agreement claims that he is

entitled to bring a vindicatio action if he is evicted from the land?

A lessee is dominus for the purpose and for the period of his lease. The lease

is considered to be a pro tan to alienation and the lessee has rights as an

owner and possessor. He has jura in rem rights against the world.

The gist of the decision in Pathirana vs. Jayasundera says that, If the lessee

is disturbed by the lessor himself the action will not be a rei vindicatio but and

action on the breach of Agreement.

In Wimala Perera vs. Kalyani Sriyalatha (S.C. Appeal No. 51/2010, decided

on 18.07.2011), Tilakawardane, J. emphasized that,

It is, indeed, settled law in Sri Lanka that a lessee is not entitled to

dispute his landlord's title by refusing to give up possession of the

property at the termination of his lease on the ground that he acquired

,

7

certain rights to the property subsequent to him becoming the lessee

and during the period of tenancy.

However, if he (the lessee) is evicted by a third person, he may bring a

vindicatory action, because he is deemed owner for the period of the lease.

But in the instant case the Appellant has failed to prove that the questioned

Lease Agreement was not terminated.

Therefore, considering the above legal authorities, I abundantly reaffirm that

in a rei vindicatio action of this nature the Appellant is obliged to establish his

title.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of

the Learned District Judge. Therefore, appeal dismissed without costs.
