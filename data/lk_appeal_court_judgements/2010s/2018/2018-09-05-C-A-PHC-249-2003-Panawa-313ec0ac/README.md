JUDGMENT

4

The Complainant- Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st Respondent) had filed an information in the Primary

Court of Kegalle under section 66 (1) informing the learned Primary Court

Judge about an existence of a breach of peace between two parties over a

dispute relating to a land.

Hewagama Mudalige Don Meril Joseph Jayasinghe who is the 1st party

Respondent - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the 2nd Respondent) was named as the 1st Party in the said

information.

Panawala Ralalge Wijethillake and Halawatha Mudiyanselage Thejandevi

Ananda Wijesinghe (hereinafter sometimes respectively called and referred

to as the 2nd and 3rd Respondents) were named as the 2nd party.

Learned Primary Court Judge, having inquired into this complaint, by his

order dated 2002-06-06, had held that the 2nd Respondent is entitled to the

peaceful possession .of the land in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

2nd Party Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called

and referred to as the Appellants) had filed a revision application in the

5

Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle urging

the Provincial High Court to revise the order made by the learned Primary

Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court of Kegalle after hearing parties, by its judgment

dated 2003-09-17, had sent the case back to the learned Primary Court

Judge directing him to identify and decide the exact portion of the alleged

encroachment.

It is that judgment which the Appellant seeks to canvass in this appeal

before this Court.

The dispute relevant to this case had arisen when the Appellant had

constructed a boundary wall along the boundary of his land to separate his

property from the properties of his immediate neighbors who are the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents.

It is to be noted that the learned Primary Court Judge had also proceeded

to inspect the sight before making the impugned order.

Learned Primary Court Judge having considered the material adduced

before him had held by his order dated 2002-06-06 that the Appellant had

6

encroached upon the lands of his neighbors when constructing his

boundary wall. Learned Primary Court Judge had directed that the 2nd

Respondent is entitled to possess the said portion of land encroached by

the Appellant. Learned Primary Court Judge had directed that all

obstructions pertaining to the said right of possession of the 2nd

Respondent be removed.

Upon a revision application filed by the Appellant, learned Provincial High

Court Judge had directed the learned Primary Court Judge to ascertain and

determine the exact portion of the land, which the Appellant had

encroached before carrying out his order.

It is the view of this Court that it would be in the best interest of all the

parties to ascertain with certainty the portion of the encroached land.

It is the observation of this Court that the major part of the written

submission filed on behalf of the Appellant contains the facts to propose as

to why the learned Primary Court Judge should have held in his favour.

It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an

appeal against a judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not

,.

7

to consider an appeal against the Primary Court order but to consider an

appeal in which an order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought be impugned.

It is relevant to observe that this Court in the case of Nandawathie and

another V Mahindasena1 also had taken the above view. It is noteworthy

that this Court in that case2 had stated that the right given to an aggrieved

party to appeal to Court of Appeal in a case of this nature should not be

taken as an appeal in the true sense but in fact an application to examine

the correctness, legality or the propriety of the order made by the High

Court Judge in the exercise of its revisionary powers.3

This Court in the case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and others4

considered the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the Primary Courts

and proceeded to hold as follows.

" ... The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of

the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace

arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession, which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court ... "

In the above circumstances and for the foregOing reasons, this Court

decides to dismiss this appeal without costs.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
