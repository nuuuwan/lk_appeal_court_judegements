Samayawardhena, J.

The respondent-petitioner-petitioner (petitioner) filed this appeal

with leave obtained from the former Bench against the order the

Board of Quazis dated 22.07.2017 by which the Board of Quazis

refused to issue notice on the petitioner-respondent-respondent

(respondent) on the revision application filed by the petitioner

before the Board of Quazis dated 01.06.2017. By that revision

application, the petitioner sought to set aside the Kaikuli order

of the Quazi dated 05.09.2015 (P1).

Notwithstanding the petitioner in the prayer to the petition

(tendered before the Board of Quazis dated 01.06.2017) speaks

about an order dated 05.09.2015 regarding Kaikuli, he has, in

paragraph 2 of the petition, stated that it was not a compelling

order (except in respect of the payment of Rs.25,000/= as a part

of Kaikuli).

P1 is in Tamil language and the English translation provided to

this Court fortifies the said position. The relevant portion in P1

reads as follows:

25,000/= money should be paid.

10 sovereigns of jewelry and 1 shop

Husband said to file a case regarding shop and obtain

Wife was told regarding this

The fact that there was no compelling order is further reinforced

by P1A and P4 as well. P1A dated 06.02.2017 is a Show Cause

Notice sent to the petitioner asking him to appear before the

Quazi on 18.02.2017 with Kaikuli. The petitioner has refused to

go. Then another Show Cause Notice marked P4 dated

05.04.2017 has been sent to the petitioner asking him to appear

3

before the Quazi on 06.05.2017 with his evidence (2017.03.25

25,000/-, 10 ,

.

2017.05.06 ../.. 9.00

) and also kaikuli (

. ,

2017.05.06

.) It has further been stated in P4 that, if

he fails to appear on the due date, the Enforcement Order would

be issued to the Magistrates Court to recover the money. The

petitioner without going before the Quazi with his evidence or

witnesses to convince why he is not bound to pay Kaikuli, has

gone before the Board of Quazis asking the Board of Quazis to

cancel the Kaikuli order.

In my view, without the petitioner first going before the Quazi in

response to Show Cause Notice and telling his grievance before

the Quazi, he cannot straightaway come before the Board of

Quazis asking the Board of Quazis to cancel the Kaikuli order,

which he himself says is not an order.

If there was a Kaikuli order already made, there is no necessity

for the Quazi to send the Show Cause Notice P4 asking the

petitioner to appear before the Quazi with the petitioners

evidence on 06.05.2017.

It is not clear on what basis the Show Cause Notice was sent.

According to Rule 4 of the Fourth Schedule to the Muslim

Marriage and Divorce Act, No.13 of 1951, as amended, such

Show Cause Notice is sent after entering ex parte order nisi, but

4

before it being made absolute. In terms of Rule 10, no appeal

lies even against such order absolute, but the dissatisfied party

can go before the Quazi within reasonable time to purge default.

However, the aforesaid Kaikuli order was not made ex parte, but

apparently, inter partes.

As a general observation I must state that, dissatisfied parties go

before the Board of Quazis whenever they receive a Show Cause

Notice from the Quazi, and the Board of Quazis, without a

murmur, entertains those applications or appeals, and try the

matters on merits. That is a wrong procedure. That is what has

happened in this case also. The party who receives the Show

Cause Notice shall first go before the Quazi and tell what he or

she has to say to the Quazi, and shall come before the Board of

Quazis only if he or she is dissatisfied with the order of the

Quazi. The Board of Quazis is an appellate body. The position

is the same in respect of ex parte orders. The defaulter cannot

come before the Board of Quazis without first making an

application to the Quazi to purge default. If the Quazi refuses it,

then only can the defaulter come before the Board of Quazis

challenging that order. The only exception would be the rare

instance of entertaining a revision application filed against an ex

parte order made by the Quazi, which is palpably wrong,

perverse and resulted in a manifest failure of justice.

According to section 97 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act,

Kaikuli, for the purpose of the Act does not include immovable

properties.

The Quazi in both Show Cause Notices marked P1A and P4 has

stated that if the petitioner fails to appear before the Quazi, the

Enforcement Order would be issued to the Magistrates Court to

5

recover the money as a fine. This has been acknowledged, if not

approved, by the Board of Quazis in the impugned order. This is

incorrect. In terms of section 64 of the Act, Enforcement Orders

cannot be issued to the Magistrates Court for the recovery of

Kaikuli. In terms of section 65 of the Act, Kaikuli can be

recovered only as a money decree through the Primary Court.

The Board of Quazis has not taken any of those matters into

account when they made the impugned order dated 22.07.2017.

The Board has gone on irrelevant matters to refuse Notice on the

application.

Even though I am not in agreement with the reasoning of the

Board, I agree with the conclusion of the Board that the

petitioners application shall be dismissed (on the ground that

the petitioner cannot come before the Board of Quazis when a

Show Cause Notice is served by the Quazi). Hence appeal is

dismissed without costs.

Let the petitioner go before the Quazi and make a suitable

application.
