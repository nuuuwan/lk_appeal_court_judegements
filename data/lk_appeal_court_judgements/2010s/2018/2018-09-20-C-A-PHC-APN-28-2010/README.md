ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an application preferred by the Respondent-Respondent-

Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent- Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as

the "Petitioner") challenging an order of the Provincial High Court holden

in Matara, delivered on 29.09.2009 in Case No. SP/ HCCA/ MAT/

WRIT/08/2008 as well as in the connected Appeal bearing case No. CA

(PHC) No.193/2009 , seeking the said identical relief.

In seeking a prerogative Writ of Certiorari from the Provincial High

Court, the Complainant-Petitioner-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner-

2

------:..:::-.. :==-._=-=::= ====-.:===== ----=-=---;.;...-;..=--=.---...=----

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "1st Respondent") moved Court

to quash an order under Section 7(7)(b)(ii) of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000 made by the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the "2nd Respondent"), an Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Development at Hambantota.

Since the Petitioner had sought similar relief under two different

jurisdictions of this Court, it is appropriate for this Court to deal with the

appeal and to make its determination covering both these cases.

It is helpful at the very outset to refer to the long history of litigation

between the two contesting parties namely, the Petitioner and the 1st

Respondent to consider the submissions in the correct perspective.

The 1st Respondent is the landlord of a paddy land known as

Welikumbura, situated at Udawila in Weerawila, an area coming under the

purview of the 2nd Respondent. Upon a complaint by the 1st Respondent

that the Appellant is in arrears of rent, the office of the 2nd Respondent

initiated an inquiry and determined that the Petitioner is in fact in arrears

of rent. This determination was conveyed to the Petitioner with the

direction that if she fails to pay the arrears within the given period, her

tenancy would be terminated. Upon the Petitioner's failure to pay arrears

of rent her tenancy was terminated. Thereafter, Commissioner General of

3

--------=--.==--=-==.=-.=--=---= :;..--==== ~==~===========-== ==-=-====!I

Agrarian Development has rescinded the said termination of tenancy' and

the Petitioner was granted further time to pay her arrears.

In view of this determination by the Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development, the 1st Respondent successfully sought judicial

review by seeking Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus against him and the

2nd Respondent in the Provincial High Court holden in Hambantota in case

No. HCA 79/2001. The Petitioner had the said order set aside by this Court

in CA (PHC) 206/2003 on the basis that the Provincial High Court had no

Writ jurisdiction over the Commissi.oner General. Then the 1st Respondent

moved Supreme Court and in S.c. Appeal No. 33 /2007 (reported as

Wijesuriya v Wanigasinghe and Others (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 231), the Apex

Court has accepted the determination by this Court that a Provincial High

Court lacked jurisdiction to issue a . Writ of Mandamus against the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development.

Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent by his letter dated 20.08.2008

(marked as Pl in the application before the Provincial High Court),

directed the 1st Respondent to vacate the disputed paddy land within 14

days. The 1st Respondent sought to quash the said order in the Provincial

High Court holden in Matara by seeking a Writ of Certiorari in Case No.

SP/HCCA/MAT/WRIT/08/2008. The Petitioner objected to the

application placing reliance of preliminary objections.

The Provincial High Court in delivering its order on 29.09.2009,

issued Writ of Certiorari and quashed PI, having held that it had 4

:=--=-_-_::= . ==.:: -- ---':=:7== ===_-.. -_--="--_-....;..=_'=-=.======-=-=:.=.-=-=-=-=-=-====-.--.=:=:!J

jurisdiction over the determination of the 2nd Respondent, in issuing Pl to

the 1 st Respondent. The Provincial High Court held in favour of the 1 st

Respondent.

In challenging the validity of the said order of the Provincial High

Court before this Court, the Petitioner contended that the Provincial High

Court erred in its failure to state the reasons upon which it issued Writ of

Certiorari in quashing Pl. She further submitted that the Provincial High

Court had erred in overruling the preliminary objections raised by her as

to the maintainability of the application for Writ.

The impugned order of the Provincial High Court, states that 1/ at the

hearing of the application the President Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent

as well as the State Counsel for the 1st Respondent took up certain objection as

preliminary nature .. .. " and proceeded to consider them.

The Petitioner's written submissions tendered to Provincial High

Court confines only to the said preliminary objections taken up at the

hearing of the applicatio.n. The Petitioner in her written submissions took

up a preliminary objection as to the jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court on the basis that it has no jurisdiction over the 2nd Respondent who

issued Pl. In addition, the Petitioner also claimed that the affidavit of the

1 st Respondent, annexed to her Petition seeking issuance of a prerogative

Writ, is defective owing to violation of the provisions of Oaths and

Affirmations Ordinance and that she failed to include a necessary party to

5

the application, namely, the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development.

In her written submissions, as the Petitioner before the Provincial

High Court, the 1 st Res~ondent too had confined herself to address only

the preliminary objections raised by the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent.

The Provincial High Court, in its impugned order rejects the

preliminary objection on jurisdiction as well as the objection on the

validity of the affidavit. In addition, it dealt with the issue of "undue

delay" apparently raised by the Petitioner. However, having overruled

the three preliminary objections, it should have afforded an opportunity

for the contesting parties to make their submissions on the merits to assist

Court to determine the issue whether the 1st Respondent is entitled to the

relief she prayed for, by applying the relevant principles of judicial review

on administrative actions. Instead, the Provincial High Court had issued

Writ of Certiorari without any assistance by the parties or considering the

merits or demerits of the application of the 1 st Respondent.

Relevant part of the impugned order is reproduced below;

"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the 1st and 2nd

respondents have failed to establish their preliminary

objections raised with regard to the maintainability of this

application for the reasons stated above. Hence, the order

dated 20.08.2008, marked as PI is hereby quashed, as no

failure of justice should occasion to the petitioner due to the

erroneous order."

6

Unfortunately, it is not possible to ascertain the basis on which the

Provincial High Court thought that the PI should be quashed as the order

contains no reasons which could be attributable to justify arriving at such a

finding as evident from the part reproduced above. Therefore, the

Petitioner's contention is that the Provincial High Court has failed to

consider the application of the 1st Respondent on its merits to satisfy itself

whether her entitlement of judicial review on administrative action and

intervention of the Court by issuance of a Writ is a valid complaint.

In the circumstances, the Petitioner is entitled to relief she prayed for

in her application that the order dated '29.09.2009 issued by the Provincial

High Court in case No. SP/HCCA/MAT/WRIT/08/2008 be set aside by

allowing her appeal. In addition to these reliefs, the Petitioner further

seeks to dismiss the Writ application of the 1st Respondent ( Case No.

SP/HCCA/MAT/WRIT/08/2008).

In her petition, the Petitioner sought relief from this Court pleading

its appellate jurisdiction against the order of the Provincial High Court.

The written submissions of the Petitioner are confined to the following

issues;

--------

i. Whether the Provincial High Court erred in law by failing to

give reasons to quash the impugned decision contained in PI ?

ii. Whether the Provincial High Court failed to consider properly

that the 1st Respondent was guilty of lashes?

7

__ ,_" ____ . __ ;-==.-... - .. -.~.------==::!J

In the written submissions of the 1st Respondent filed in this Court,

she did not address the issue of the merits of her application for a

prerogative Writ but only the issue of jurisdiction.

Thus, it is seen that neither the Petitioner nor the 1st Respondent did

address the issue of the merits of the application of the 1st Respondent

before the Provincial High Court seeking a prerogative Writ before this

Court in the instant application.

It is therefore noted that in the instant Application and her connected

Appeal the Petitioner only invoked appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

of this Court. If this Court were to determine the application of the Writ on

its merits, then it would be exercising original jurisdiction over the parties

instead of its appellate or supervisory jurisdiction that had been invoked

by the Petitioner. There is no such invitation made to this Court by the

parties in their written submissions either.

A similar situation arose for determination of this Court in CA

(PHC) 63/2012 - C.A.M. of 13.07.2018, where De Silva J held the view that;

"The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that this Court

is entitled to go into the merits of the revision application filed

before the High Court of Panadura and make order thereon.

Having given my anxious consideration to this submission I am

of the view that legally it is not permissible to do so. The learned

High Court Judge has not considered the merits of the revision

application made by the Appellant. In these circumstances, this

Court will be usurping the revisionary jurisdiction of the High

Court by examining the merits of the application when the High

Court has not done so. Such a course of action on the part of this

--'==--:::;---=-'-'-===== -==-== ==== ===-====

8

Court will also deprive a party the right of appeal it has against

the order of the High Court on the merits of the application."

In the circumstances, this Court sets aside the order of the Provincial

High Court delivered on 29. 09. 2009 in Ca~e No. SP/HCCA/ MAT/

WRIT/08/2008 by allowing the appeal of the Appellant and also by

granting relief as prayed for in the paragraph "B" of the prayer to the

petition in her revision application No. CA (PHC) APN 28/2010.

The matter is accordingly remitted back to the relevant Provincial

High Court directing it to make an appropriate determination on the

issuance of a prerogative Writ upon the merits with a further direction by

this Court for its expeditious disposal.
