Trincomalle, that, on or around 09th August 2007 within the

jurisdiction of that Court, the Accused-Appellant had in posses.siofi 2

the above indictment.

1 st witness of the Police Inspector Nishantha .

. ,2n?witness .qf the Police Con..stable 21879 Apeywi~1:creIIla

3rd witness Sub Inspector Gamage

5th witness Police Sergeant 59103 Jayanethi

6 th witness Police Constable 8051 Jayasundara

13th witness P.G. Madawella Deputy Government Analyst.

The said witnesses were cross-examined by the defence counsel and at

the conclusion of the trial written submissions were tendered by

counsel.

On 26.11.2015 judgment was delivered convicting the Accused-

Appellant and was sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence imposed on him, by the

High Court, the Accused-Appellant preferred an appeal on the following

question of law and other substantial questions on facts that may be

urged by the counsel for the Accused-Appellant.

a) The Honourable High Court Judge has not addressed his

mind to the several contradictions, omissions and

improbabilities which were very glaring in the evidence led

by the prosecution and in the documents tendered.

3

b) Whether the Learned High Court Judge erred in fact and in

law by failing to consider the maters set out below among

other substantial questions of fact that may be urged by the .

Counsel of the Defendant-Appellant at the time of hearing

this appeal;

1. Whether the police party of 10 including the Defendant-

Appellant could travel in a Jeep which coUld

accommodate only 4 to the spot where the purported

recovery was made.

11. Whether the Police Constable 21879 Abeywickrama who

took the purported statement from Defendant-

Appellant is competent in Tamil language? who only

pasted the purported confession dated 15th September

2007 in the Grave Crimes Information Book under

Date: 2007 September 16 time 07.15 page 391

Paragraph 104 in the case bearing No: HCT/402/2010

wherein ASP Trincomalee II states that since the

suspect didn't know Sinhalese, police constable 59274

....... 4

Sahayarasa was asked to translate while recording the

confession of the accused before the ASP.

iii. Since both police constable 59274 Sahayarasa and

police constable 21879 Abeywickrama are from the

Uppuvelly Police station. If 21879 Abeywickrama had

competence in translating from Tamil to Sinhalese ASP

would have got him to translate instead of only pasting

the confession in Grave Crimes Information Book.

iv. Whether the productions were introduced by the police

in the light of several contradiction in the evidence led

by the prosecution?

According to the judgment dated 26.11.2015, we observe that there

IS no evaluation of evidence of witnesses put forward by the

prosecution. We also observe the final paragraph of the judgment

which narrates the conclusion in arriving at the conviction. This case

was heard before four High Court Judges and the adoption of

proceedings are not properly done. According to decided Judgments of

the Supreme Court, the non adoption of proceedings is a fatal error

where cases are sent back to the original court for re-trial. In this

matter, the Accused-Appellant has been in remand custody for 11

( ..

\ : ! 5

long years. For the reasons stated and considering the period of

incaseration, we are of the view that this is not a fit case to be sent for

re-trial. Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence and acquit

the Accused-Appellant from all charges leveled against him. We direct

the Superintendant of Prison to release the accused-appellant from

their custody on receipt of the judgment of this Court.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this order to

the Superintendant of Prisons and the relevant High Court .

Appeal allowed.
