"acts Ofthe"case:

Tlle petitioner-appellant (hereinafter .refet:ed to as the "appellant") had filed a

petition in the Provincial High Court of Colombo seeking a Writ in the nature of

l\lfandamus directing the 1 st respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"1 st respondent") to take appropriate le&al' actions against the 5th respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as ithe "5th respondent") to remove an

obstruction in a ditch situated between the lands of the appellant and the 5th

respondent. The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo on 23.04.2014 dismissed

the application of the appellant subject to a cost of Rs.1 0, 000. Being aggrieved by

the said dismissal, the appellant preferred an appeal to this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted following grounds of appeal;

1) The Leatped High Court Judge had not considered the documents filed

with the case,

2) The Learned High Court Judge h?d not considered the documents marked

as "P5" and "P6" which indicated thJ~re was an unauthorized construction,

3) The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that the 5th

respondent was the legal owner of tne said corpus,

4) The Learned High Court Judgej;had failed to consider that the proper

substitution had been made and COli'rt: had accepted it.

We will consider the 4th ground of appeal tirst. We observe that the 5th respondent

mentioned in the original petition had died and the appellant had filed an amended

petition dated 08.12.2009 with the name of 5th substituted respondent. The Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo in the or~er dated 23.04.2014, has held that the

substitution made with regard to the 5th respondent was contrary to law. However,

I we observe that this particular question pf law was addressed by the preceding

Page 4pf 12

, 'JI~Ml /

~ 'I ,,$I r Judge in the order dated 22,08.2012, and had held that the substitution was in

accordance with law. The Learned High Court Judge had held as follows;

"

" Accordingly the case was fixed for argument. However, the succeeding judge who

delivered the final order has blatantly disr~garded the said order. Since the Learned

High Court Judge has not referred to t~)e said order in the final order dated

23.04.2014, it is questionable whether the Leamed Judge intended to overrule the

said order andlorto act inper incuriam.

In the case of Cargills Agri~oods Ltd. V. Commissioner-General of Inland

) Revenue & 6 others [C.A. (Writ) Application No. 198/2012], it was stated that,

"Furthermore, in the Indian case oJ: Government of A.P. and Another V. B.

Sathyanarayan Rao (dead) by L.R.S.amd others reported in [2000 (4)

5. c. C.262, it was held as follows: "The rule of per incuriam can be applied

where the court omits to consider a ~inding precedent of the same court or a

., Superior Court rendered on the same issue or where the court. omits to

, consider any statute while deciding the same issue. "

Basnayake J (as he then was) in the case of Alasupillai v. Yavetpillai [1949

(39) C L W 107 and 108J gave the following definition: ''A decision per

! incuriam is one given when a case' or statute has not been brought to the

attention of the Court and it has given the decision in ignorance or

", forgetfulness of the existence of that case or that statute".

Page 5 C. f 12

I

However, the circumstances of tlli~' case do not show that there had been such an ignorance of the law l,y the COllrt in this instance. Nevertheless, the

authorities cited by both the Counsel show that our Courts have extended;

the aforesaid rule per incuriam ev;'n to remedy an injury caused to a party'

when there had been a mistake on the part of the Court ... "

Therefore it is our view that the Learned,High Court Judge was not empowered to

overrule an order made by the same Coqrt without pointing out any ignorance or

error on the part of Court and such overruling should be done by an Appellate

Court. Further it would cause prejudice ~D the appellant who had proceeded with

his case relying on the order dated 22:08.2012 in which it was held that the

substitution was lawful. The appellant could have instituted a fresh action within

that period of 2 years. Accordingly w.e answer the 4th ground of appeal in

affirmative.

, . , i

We will consider grounds of appeal No.1 to 3 together. The Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo in the order dated 23.'04.2014 has stated that the appellant had

not submitted a phin or sketch to Court and the appellant had failed to explain the

area from where the 5th respondent had disturbed the free flowing of the water. We'

perused the documents marked as "ea 1" fi,"0'a2 (q) and "0'a2 (q::" in the brief. The

appellant has submitted the Deed of gift ~,'[0.1087 dated 02.08.1988 attested by the

notary public Proeson Fernando marked as "0'a 1 ", from which she acquired the

rights of the land. The appellant has furtht~r submitted two plans i.e. plan No. 429

marked as "0'a2 (q)" and plan No. 1530 marked as "0'a2 (q::". As per the plan

No.429 there is a ditch to the north of lot B2.

The Learned Counsel for the 5th respondent has submitted that there is no ditch to

the western boundary of lot 9 in the plan No. 1530 and the appellant has claimed

rights from the plan No. 1530 and not fro'm plan No. 429. The Learned Counsel for

Pagel; of 12

,-~

~~~; ff

c -I r)

.,~ / / " the 5th respondent further submitted thal therp was no evidence before Court

whether the lot B2 in plan 429 correspor,ds to lot 9 in plan 1530. The Learned

Counsel further contended that although t~le appellant claimed a ditch as per plan

429, no rights had been passed on to the Appellant on plan 429. Accordingly the

Learned Counsel submitted that if the app~llant is not the owner of lot B2, then he

has no locus standi to maintain this applic~tion.

In the case of Thajudeen V. Sri Lanka 'rea 'Board and another (1981) 2 SLR

, ~ 471, it was held that,

"Where the major facts are-in dispute and the legal result of the facts is

subject to controversy and it is r,ecessary that the questions should be , canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity of

examining the witnesses so that the Court would be better able to judge

which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

Mandamus is pre-eminently a discn.etionary remedy. It is an extraordinary,

residuary and suppletory remedy to be granted only when there is no other

means of obtaining justice. Even thqugh all other requirements for securing

the remedy have been satisfied by the applicant, the court will decline to

exercise its discretion in his favour ,if a specific alternative remedy like a

regular action equally convenient, beneficial and effective is available ... "

However, we observe that the rights have been passed to the appellant on plan 429

as per the Deed No. 1087 (page 155 of the brief).

It is pertinent to note that two letters dated 08.10.2007 and 15.1 0.2007 had been

sent to the father of the 5th respondent by the 2nd respondent namely the chairman

of the urban council of Boralesgamuwa (7'age 161 & 162 of the brief). In the said

two letters it had been informed that legai action would be taken against the father

Page 7 of 12

of the 5th respondent upon the failure tb remove the obstruction caused to the

disputed ditch as observed by the technical officer- of the urban council.

Accordingly it is undisputed that a technical officer had inspected the scene and'

made a report to the chairman of the ~rban council about the existence of an

r: . obstruction. Therefore we are of the vie~1 that the Learned High Court Judge had

misdirected herself in stating that the app~llant had failed to establish the existence

i of a ditch between the two lands and the existence of an obstruction to the said . t

ditch.

! The Learned Counsel for the 5th respondent has submitted that the relief sought by

the appellant was of personal nature and cannot be granted in terms of Article

154(P) (3) of the Constitution.

The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo in the order dated 23.04.2014 has held

as follows;

"Z5)U~OC)25J 0 1-4 ~zsfu:) UCD C25JZ5)02:3)6rU2SJ O{;)25J O)CZ5) 0tD:! 25) CD 52:3)

.f , C@) CDI~C) @@Z5)2512:3) cr32:3)zs) 25)~Z5) ... "

The section 108 of the Urban Council Ordinance reads as follows;

(1) Every private drain in any town shall be under the survey and control bf

the Urban Council of that town, aIld shall be constructed, altered, repaired or

kept in proper order as the Coundl may require, at the cost and charges of , the owners of the land or buildinf; to which such drain belongs or for the use

of which it is constructed

(2) If the owner of any land or building to which any such drain belongs

neglects during eight days after the service of a written notice in that behalf

Page 8 of 12

by the Council, to alter, repair or put the'drain in good order in such manner

as may be specified in the notice, toe Council may' cause such 4rain to be

altered, repaired, or put in good '~rder in the manner required, and the I

expenses incurred therein by the 9,Juncil shall be paid by the owner, and

shall be recoverable as hereinafter provided.

It is evident that the 1 st respondent had nit,led to comply with the section 108(2) of

the Urban Council Ordinance.

The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo ih the order dated 23.04.2014 has held

.' .f .. that the appellant had failed to state in th~ petition precisely what action needed to

be prevented.

In the case of Rev. Battaramulle Seelarathana V. Ceylon Electricity Board and . ' 33 others rCA 213/2007], it was held th~t,

"A writ of mandamus cannot b~ issued to prevent a person from doing

things; it is to compel a person ~n' authority to perform his duty that he is

,f legally bound to do ... " I

In the book of Administrative Law byWade and Forsyth [Ninth Edition at page

-j 615] it states that;

"The prerogative remedy of mandamus has long provided the normal means

of enforcing the performance of public duties by public authorities of all

kinds. Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally granted on the

application of a private litigant, though it may equally be used by one pubjic

authority against another. The cpmmonest employment of mandamus is as a , weapon in the hands of the ordi;~ary citizen, when a public authority fails to

i do its duty by him. Certiorari land prohibition deal with wrongful action, .! mandamus deals with wrongful inaction ... "

Page 9 of 12

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge had -manifestly misdirected herself with

regard to the nature of a writ of Mandar:zus. We observe that the appellant had

, . repeatedly requested the I st to 4th respo~Jdents to take appropriate legal action ;1 against the 5th respondent but they had fail~d to do so. Therefore such inaction on

" the part of the government authority will certainly warrant an issuing a writ of

~:. Mandamus.

, In the case of K.K.P. Fernando V. Re~ister General and another [eA Writ

'e 4 application No. 43/2012], it was held thatj,

"The writ of mandamus is a weapOt1. It can be used against a public officer

or authority if he fails to do his public duty by him. The way of enforcing the

" order of Court, that is to say the way of using the weapon, is punishing the

person for "contempt of Court if he fails or neglects to act according to the

direction given by court ... "

:,.

In the case of Dayan and a V. Thalwatte(2001) 2 Sri.L.R. 73, it was held that,

"An aggrieved person who is seekng to set aside an unfavourable decision

made against him by a public authority could apply for a prerogative writ of

certiorari and if the application is.to compel an authority to perform a duty

he would ask for a writ of mandapus and similarly if an authority is to be

prevented from exceeding its jur(sdiction the remedy of prohib!tion was

available. Therefore it is necessarylfor the Petitioner to specify the writ he is

seeking supported by specific averments why such relief is sought. "

We are of the view that if a prayer can be certain enough to satisfactorily identify

itself with decision of the public authority which it seeks to enforce, from the body

of the petition, then such decision can be!'enforced by way ofa mandamus.

Page:O of 12

i1 We observe that the appellant, in the prayer of the petition, has not referred to the

obstruction caused t9 the ditch and the lett\~r of the urban council dated 15.10.2007

which he seeks to enforce. However the "appellant has constantly referred to the

said letter marked as "P6" in the petition and it is evident that the petition

unequivocally relied on the same. The app~l1ant had sent several letters through her

Attorney at Law demanding the 2nd respopdent to take appropriate legal action as

per "P6". Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the prayer referred to the "P6" in

the body of petition. . I

The Learned State Counsel for the AttofI\~Y General has submitted that he has no

I objection for the grant of relief to the ,\ppellant. Accordingly we set aside the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 23.04.2014.

We issue a writ ~f Mandamus in terms o.{ the prayer (ep) of the amended petition

dated 08.12.2009.

The 5th respondent is ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/= to the appellant as cost

of this application.

Accordingly the appeal is allowed.
