Judgment s. Thurairaja, PC. J

This is an appeal preferred by the Attorney General against the sentence imposed on

the Accused Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Respondent") in

High Court case No. 87/2013, High Court of Avissawella.

The Attorney General had indicted the Accused-Respondent, Mahayagodage Ranjith

Rohana Perera alias Podiunnahe and the 1st count is for possessing aT-56 automatic

weapon punishable under Section 22(3) read with Section 22(1) of the Firearms

Ordinance No.33 of 1916 as amended by Act No.22 of 1996. 2nd count is

unauthorized possession of a shotgun punishable under Section 22(3) read with

Section 22(1) of the Firearms Ordinance NO.33 of 1916 as amended by Act No.22 of

1996. The 3rd count is in the same transaction, the offence of keeping a shotgun

without a licence punishable under Section 22(3) read with Section 22(1) of the

Firearms Ordinance No.33 of 1916 as amended by Act No.22 of 1996 and 4th count is

possessing of 35 live cartridges punishable under the Explosives Act as amended by

Act no.33 of 1969 and Act no.18 of 2005.

Indictment was served on 10th March 2013 and the matter was fixed for trial. On the

4th day of trial, 11 th August 2016 the Accused-Respondent pleaded guilty for all four

counts in the indictment. Accordingly he was imposed following sentences.

1. For the 1st count he was imposed Rs.10,OOO/- fine, in default 2 years simple

imprisonment, further sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

2. For the 2nd count he was imposed Rs.10,OOO/- fine, in default 2 years

simple imprisonment, further sentence of 6 months rigorous

3. For the 3rd count he was imposed Rs.10,OOO/- fine, in default 2 years simple

imprisonment, further sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

4. For the 4th count he was imposed Rs.25,OOO/- fine, in default 5 years simple

imprisonment, further sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

CA 142/2016 JUDGMENT Page 2 of9

Learned Trial Judge had suspended the sentence of 6 months on each count and

suspended the same for a period of 20 years.

Being aggrieved with the sentence imposed on the Accused-Respondent, the

Attorney General preferred this appeal stating that the sentence is illegal. Therefore

he seeks a relief from this Court to impose a lawful sentence stipulated under the

relevant law.

It is observed the Accused-Respondent had pleaded guilty to all four counts.

Therefore Section 14(b) (1) ofthe Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 is to be considered.

'~ny person who stands convicted of any offence by the High Court may appeal

there from to the Court of AppeaL-

In a case tried without a jury, as of right from any conviction or sentence except

in the case where-

l. The accused has pleaded guilty; or

ll. The sentence is for a period of imprisonment of one month of whatsoever

nature or a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees:

Provided that in every such case there shall be an appeal on a question of

law or where the Accused has pleaded guilty on a question of sentence only.

Now the appeal before the Court is only against the sentence. It should be

appropriate to see the relevant law, for the purpose of easy reference; the relevant

sections are reproduced below.

Section 22 of the Firearms Ordinance No.33 of 1916 as amended by Act No.22 of

1996-

CA 142/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of9

Section 9(2) of the Explosives Act as amended by Act no.33 of 1969 and Act no.18 of

2005-

"Subject to the provisions of section 70, no person shall, except under the

authority of a permit, import, export, acquire, possess, transport or use any

explosives for any purpose other than that of such business as is referred to in

subsection (1). (2) Subject to the provisions of section 70, no person shall, except

under the authority of a permit, import, export, acquire, possess, transport or use

any explosives for any purpose other than that of such business as is referred to

in subsection (1). "

It is the submission of the Deputy Solicitor General that the only sentence for the 1st

count can be imposed as per the Firearms Ordinance is life imprisonment. Therefore

the sentence imposed in the present case is illegal and inappropriate.

The President's Counsel for the Accused-Respondent had submitted two written

submissions and an affidavit from the Accused-Respondent. The Counsels are relying

on the Judgment of the Attorney General vs Ambagala Mudiyanselage Samantha

(SC Appeal No. 17/2013) and submits that there is no minimum mandatory

sentence condition can be imposed on the judicial authorities. Hence the Trial Judge

can impose any sentence he thinks deemed to be fit.

I carefully perused the said judgment and two other judgments referred in that said

case. It will be appropriate to refer the Supreme Court judgment delivered on under

the case no. SC Appeal 17/2013 dated 1 t h March 2015. That was an appeal by the

appellant arising out of CA 297/2008 and High Court of Kurunegala 259/2006.

According to the said jUdgment, the facts of the case described as follows.

"The Appellant, a labourer in occupation had married the victim's sister. They

had no children in that marriage. The victim's sister had left the country without

the consent of the husband about a year after the marriage. The Appellant was

then invited by the victim's parents ie his mother in law and father in law, to

CA 142/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of9

..

come and live with them in their house. The victim was a 75 year old girl

attending school. Only four of them lived in that house. The girl was found to

be pregnant when her mother took her to the hospital when she was unwell.

Then the pregnancy was 5 months old. The parents stopped her going to school;

told the Appellant not to come home again; took her to another village and kept

her there, with an older married couple who had no children, having in mind to

hand over the baby to them when it is born. The parents did not go to the

Police. The victim girl did not make any complaint to the Police.

Most unexpectedly, some outsider had informed the Police of the area that the

Appellant and the victim were mysteriously missing from that house. It is only

then that the Police had launched an investigation and found that the girl was

away in another house whereas the Appellant was living with his parents in his

village closed by. The statement made to the Police revealed that the girl was

only 75 year old, and then the Appellant was taken into custody and was later

enlarged on bail.

The victim gave birth to a baby girl on 79/07/2007 in the Kuliyapitiya Base

Hospital. It is the Appellant who informed the Registrar of Births of the area that

the baby girl was born, according to her birth Certificate filed of record. It is

mentioned therein that the father of the baby is the Appellant, A.M. Samantha

Sampath and that the parents were not legally married. It is accepted that at the

time of her birth, the baby girl Sanduni Wasana had a father, the Appellant and

a mother, the victim.

The Attorney General forwarded an indictment to the High Court dated

04/08/2006. It was taken up for trial on 28/70/2008 for the first time. The

Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of rape of a girl below 76 years and he

was subject to punishment by the High Court under Section 364(2)(e) of the

Penal Code as amended by Act N0.22 of 7995. The baby Sanduni Wasana is

being paid maintenance by the Appellant and moreover he visits the school as

CA 142/2016 JUDGMENT Page 70f9

the father of the child when called upon to do so; has arranged the

transportation to and from the school and sends money to maintain the child.

The High Court imposed a punishment of 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment

suspended for 70 years and imposed a fine and compensation."

Further the Supreme Court has observed as follows.

"In the present case, we must look at the big picture with the victim of rape the

Appellant, the father of the child born, and the 70 year oLd chiLd who was born

into this worLd as a resuLt of the victim having been raped. The victim of rape

never compLained to the Police untiL after a pregnancy of 5 months when Police

on its own came to the victim in search of her when an outsider informed the

PoLice of her missing from the home. There was no chance for the victim to give

evidence as the Appellant pLeaded guilty to the charge of statutory rape of the

victim. There is a bar for the victim and the Appellant enter into a marriage as

the Appellant is aLready Legally married to the victim's sister who is Living

abroad. The chiLd is been Looked after by the AppeLLant father in the eyes of the

society, and the child is depend on the income earned by the Appellant. "

It will be mandatory for us to refer SC Reference 03/2008. This case also based on

similar facts to the decision made in Supreme Court SC Appeal 17/2013. The

applicability of SC Reference 03/2008 was clearly explained by another Supreme

Court decision in SC 179/2012.

"this however in the eyes of Court would only apply in cases when the

Accused under the age of 16 .. "(Re-produced as it is.)

Considering the purpose of sentencing in Firearms Ordinance No.33 of 1916 as

amended by Act No.22 of 1996, the legislature considering the public interest

especially protection of the public, had imposed a minimum mandatory sentence. In

our view it will not appropriate to reduce or considering of giving lenient sentence

without valid reasons is inappropriate.

CA 142/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of9

This Court should be mindful of the law and the purpose of the law. Therefore

considering all these circumstances I am of the view that sentence imposed is

inappropriate. Considering the facts the Accused-Respondent virtually had a mini-

armoury. He had no valid or reasonable explanation to offer why he had possessed

so many weapons and live ammunitions.

Considering all we find the sentence is inappropriate. Hence we vacate the sentence

imposed on the 1 st count and we impose life imprisonment.

For the 2nd count we vacate the sentence imposed and impose life imprisonment.

For the 3rd count we vacate the sentence imposed and impose life imprisonment.

The sentence imposed on the 4th count is affirmed.

Appeal allowed.
