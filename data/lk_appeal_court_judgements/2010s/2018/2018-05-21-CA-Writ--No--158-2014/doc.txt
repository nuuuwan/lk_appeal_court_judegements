The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter alia, seeking

a writ of Certiorari to quash the determination made by letter dated 511 0/20 12,

under reference No. RPM/P/L/T/29110 and registration marked XIIC and XIIB,

and a writ of Mandamus to compel the 1 sl to 3rd Respondents to approve and to

register the right of the Petitioner, of his half share of lot 61 and lot 85 in Final

Colony Plan, (FCP) No. 29.

The facts of the case in brief are as follows;

The original permit holder D.M. Punch Tikiribanda received three permits,

one permit in respect of a high land, ie. Lot No. 164 of FC Plan No. 29 and two

permits in respect of paddy land, ie. Lot No 61 and 8S in FC plan No. 29, in terms

of the Land Development Ordinance. The original permit holder passed away in

1990, nominating a half share each of all three lands to his wife H.M. Palingu

Menike and to the eldest son D.M Punchi Banda, (Sth Respondent) as successes,

and the said nominations were duly registered. The wife of the original permit

holder passed away in 1997. It is the contention of the Petitioner that the said H.M.

Palingu Menike left a last will and bequeathed half share in all three lands to the

Petitioner, the granddaughter of H.M. Palingu Menike.

The instant application is in relation to lot 8S, marked X11C. Case No.

CAlwrit1177/2014, has been filed in relation to lot 61, marked X11B, the two

paddy lands in the said plan. The subject matter in both cases are the same except

for the numerical identification of the lot numbers. Therefore, both Petitions were

taken up for argument, and the parties agreed to abide by the judgment delivered

in this case.

It is observed that, several cases have been filed in the District Court in

order to resolve the said dispute. The Petitioner refers to the impugned letter under

reference No. RPM/P/L/T/29 111 0, issued by the 2nd Respondent dated OS/10/2012,

in order to quash the registration marked XII C and XII B. The said letter under

reference No. RPMlP/L/T/29110, dated 0511012012, relied upon by the Petitioner

has not been tendered to this court, nor has it been produced in the District Court.

Plaints filed in the District Court, have been produced marked XII and X12. What

has been produced in the said actions are extracts of the registry folio 1/1/1841 A

and folio 1/1/314, of registration, marked XI1C and X11B.

In the case of Jaymvardena Vs. Sil)'{J (1969) 72NLR 25, refusing a writ of

certiorari, the court held that;

" .... it cannot be too clearly understood that the remedy by way of

Certiorari only lies to bring up to this court to and quash something which

is a determinatioll or a decision ... "

As contended in paragraph 35(x), the Petitioner is aggrieved that the 2nd

Respondent could not in law inter alia, 111:1ke a decision to approve or register the

remaining half share of the paddy land to the 51h Respondent, without having a

proper inquiry. Therefore. the Petitioner prays to quash the determination made by

letter dated 05110/2012, \vhich has direct reference to the subsequent registration

marked XII C and X1IB, dated 1211 0/20 11. I Iowever, the Petitioner has failed to

produce the impugned letter dated 05/1 0/10 11. by the 3rd Respondent, which is the

decision under challenge. Therefore. in the <lbsence of the impugned letter dated

0511 0/20 12, this court is unable to decide on the vires of the act performed by the

statutory functionary in arriving <It the s;lid decision. In the circumstances this

court is deprived of making a suit<lblc order exercising its discretion by way of

judicial review.

'. 5

The Respondents have drawn attention of court to the unexplained delay in

filling this application. The Petitioner has filed this action on or about 30115/2014,

subsequent to the registration, which took place on 12110/2012. It is well settled

law that "unexplained delay" in seeking an order in the nature of a writ is by it self

is fatal to the application. In the instant case the court observes delay in filling this

action, which has not been explained by the Petitioner.

In Jayawardena Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services (1996)

2SLR 70 at page 73, a case in point referred to by the Respondents, the court has

held,

"Petitioner seeking a prerogative writ is not entitled to relief as a matter of

course or as a matter of right or as a routine. Even he is entitled to relief

still court has discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct,

delay laches, waiver, submission 10 jurisdiction are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant ofrelief".

For the reasons set out above, the Petition is dismissed without costs.

Parties in C.A. (Writ) 177/2014 have agreed to abide by the Judgment

delivered in this case.
