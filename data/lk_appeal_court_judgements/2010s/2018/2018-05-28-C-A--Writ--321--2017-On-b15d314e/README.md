9

The 5th Respondent Company is a non-bank financial institution, which had

shown signs of collapsing. The Central Bank being concerned about the

implications of such collapses to the national economy had invited

interested investors to submit their proposals with regard to the reviving of

the 5th Respondent Company. The Petitioner is one such proposed investor

who had submitted a proposal to resuscitate the 5th Respondent Company.

According to the said proposal, the Petitioner was to infuse Rs. 1.5 Billion

into activities regarding the proposed revival of the 5th Respondent

Company. The Central Bank was to provide an equal amount of money

described as "matching funds" once the Petitioner completes depositing the

entire amount of Rs. 1.5 Billion. to the proposed reviving activities of the 5th

Respondent Company.

However, the Petitioner had only invested Rs. 198 Million on his part. The

Petitioner has defaulted his undertaking to deposit the balance amount of

money as per the proposal. Due to the above default on the part of the

Petitioner to fulfill its obligations, the resuscitation of the 5th Respondent

Company has become unsuccessful.

10

Accordingly, the central bank has called for fresh proposals in a bid to go

ahead with a second attempt to resuscitate the 5th Respondent Company.

The Petitioner Company was also permitted to submit a fresh revised

proposal.

Careful consideration of the case presented by the Petitioner shows to the

satisfaction of this Court that the Petitioner had sought a writ of Mandamus

to compel the Central Bank to accept the revised proposal (in the second

attempt) submitted by the Petitioner.

It was brought to the notice of this Court by the learned State Counsel that

the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka has already approved the most attractive

and favorable proposal submitted by a company called Lanka Credit and

Business Limited (LCBL). It is to be noted that the said LCBL in their

proposal had agreed to invest Rs. 565 Million almost immediately in

contrast to the Petitioners initial financial commitment of mere Rs. 500

Million to be invested on a staggered basis. Learned State Counsel has also

brought to the notice of this Court that the decision by the Central Bank to

go ahead with the proposal by the LCBL would immensely benefit the

depositors whose money was with the failed 5th Respondent Company. This

Court cannot permit the Petitioner to thrive unlawfully at the cost of the

11

helpless depositors who are eagerly waiting to recover their hard-earned

money deposited with the 5th Respondent Company.

In the case of Sirisena Cooray Vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayaka and two

others! the Supreme Court referring to the above case, stated as follows.

" ... The grounds of judicial review were originally broadly classified as

three-fold. The first ground is illegality; the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and

must give effect to it The second is ''irrationality'' namely Wednesbury

unreasonableness (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. V Wednesbury

Corporation. The third is ''procedural impropriety'~ (Halsbury 4h ed., Vol 11

para 60). To these grounds, a fourth may be added ''proportionality'' See

Lord Diplock in CCSU V Minister for the Civil Service at 951. ... "

The Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court that any of the above grounds

for a writ has been made out.

Further, the jurisdiction to issue writs in the nature of certiorari and

Mandamus which is vested in this Court by virtue of Article 140 of the

1 1999 (1) 5 L R 1.

12

Constitution is a jurisdiction, which this Court could decide in its discretion

to exercise in a fit case. This Court is convinced that the instant case is not

one such case in which it should exercise its discretionary writ jurisdiction.

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides

to refuse to issue notices on the Respondents.

This Application should therefore stand dismissed without costs.
