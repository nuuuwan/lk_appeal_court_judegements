This is an appeal against the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Matara dated 5th

October 2004.

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondel1t (Respondent) filed a certificate in the Magistrates Court

of Matara in terms of sections 59(1){c) and 59(4) of the Co-operative Societies Law No.5 of 1972

as amended (Law) to enforce an arbitral award made against the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant (Appellant). The arbitral award found the Appellant guilty of misappropriation of

Rs.13,22,833/82 and interest from the Multi Trol!er Owners Co-operative Society.

The Appellant filed objections to the said application and took up the following objections:

(a) The Respondent did not have power to file the certificate

(b) The arbitrator had acted in excess of his powers

(c) The Appellant is not bound to pay the amount specified in the certificate

After hearing parties, the learned Magistrate of Matara overruled the objections of the Appellant

and held that he was bound to pay the amount set out in the certificate and ordered that it be

recovered as a fine. He imposed a sentence of 6 months imprisonment in default of the payment

of the said sum.

The Appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of Matara which was dismissed. Hence

tn!s appeal.

The arguments made on behalf of the Appellant in this appeal are as follows: .,.

(a) The Respondent did not have power to file the certificate

(b) The matter could not have been referred to arbitration

These arguments must be considered after examining the scope of the proceedings in the

Magistrates Court upon a certificate filed in terms of sections 59(1)(c) and 59(4) of the Law.

In this scrutiny, it is useful and indeed permissible to examine the interpretation given by Courts

to similar provisions found in the repealed Co-operative Societies Ordinance. It is an established

rule of interpretation that the legislature is presumed to know the law, judicial decisions and

general principles of law. Bindra1 states as follows:

"The legislature must be presumed to know the course of the legislation, as well as the

course of judicial decisions in the country, a fortiorari of the superior courts of the

country. It is a well-settled rule of construction that when a statute is repealed and re-

enacted, and words in the repealed statute are reproduced in the new statute, they

should be interpreted in t~e !;CilSe which had been judicially put on them in the rej,eu:t:d

Act, because the legislature is presumed to be acquainted with the construction which

courts have put upon the words, when they repeat the same words, they must be taken

to have accepted the interpretation put on them by the court as correctly reflecting the

legislative mind."

In Nilamdeen v. Nanayakkara2 it was held that it is a well-known rule of construction that where

the legislature uses in an Act a legal term which has received judicial interpretation, it must be

assumed that the term is used in the sense in which it has been judicially interpreted. There is

also another rule of construction that where the words of an old statute are made part of a new

statute, the legal interpretation which has been put upon the former by courts of law is applicable

to those same words in the new statute.

Section 53A (5) of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance read as follows:

"The Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why

further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be taken against him

andln defau~t of s.ufficient cause being shown, the amount shaUbe deemed to be a fine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter ... " (emphasis added)

Section 59(4) of the Law reads as follows:

"Where a certificate is issued to a Magistrate under paragraph (c) of subsection (i), the

Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why

further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be taken against him,

and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the amount shall be deemed to be a fine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable

with fine only or not punishable with imprisonment, and the provisions of section 291

(except paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (1) of that section) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act,No.15 of 1979 shall thereupon apply, and the Magistrate may make any

direction which, by the provisions of that section, he could have made at the time of

imposing such sentence ... " (emphasis added)

Section 53A (7) of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance states as follows:

"Nothing in this section shall authorise or require a District Court or Magistrate in any

proceedings thereunder to consider, examine or decide the correctness of any statement

in the certificate of the Registrar."

Section 59(6) of the Law reads as follows:

"Nothing in this section shall authorize or require a District Court or Magistrate in any

proceedings thereunder to consider, examine or decide the correctness of any statement

in the certificate of the Registr;)i."

In Thambiah Seevaratnam v The Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative Development Jaffna3 it

is stated that the Co-operative Societies Ordinance was repealed by the Co-operative Societies

Law, No.5 of 1972 and that the latter entered into force from 11.10.1972.

The Supreme Court in Mohideen v. Assistant Commissioner oj Co-operative Development,

Kalmunai4 was called upon to interpret Section 53A (5) of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance

and Pathirana J. held that the only grounds that can be urged before the Magistrate are that -

(i) the Magistrate has no jurisdiction because the last known place of business or

residence does not fall within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate.

(ii) that he had paid the amount.

(iii) that he is not the defaulter in that he is not the person from whom the amount is due.

I am of the view that this is the correct interpretation to be adopted in interpreting section 59(4)

of the Law to ascertain the scope of the procedure before the Magistrates Court.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the Appellant cannot argue before the Magistrate that the

RespOnd!"'t rI:: not ilave the power to file the certificate. An atta~~, ull such exercise of power

may be accommodated in appropriate proceedings where the vires of the exercise of power can

be examined.

In any event, the submission made by the learned counsel for the Appellant that the Respondent

did not have the power to file the certificate is untenable in law. This argument is made on the

basis that the order made by the Minister of Food, Co-operative, Housing Social Services,

Probation and Child Care Services, Women's Affairs and Transport, Southern Province and

published in Gazette bearing No. 1,286 dated 2003.04.25 (Order) did not confer power on the

Respondent to file a certificate under section 59 of the Law as it does not refer to Column III but

only to Column II at two places.

It is true that the Order refers only to Column II at two places when it should have referred to

both Columns II and III. However, it firstly states "11 dOz@~ O~(5)lD Sc~ Q>@C)@" (emphasis

added) and then "11 oz.6) dOz@~ 0~(5)~ ~~ SO"(emphasis added). Clearly there is a

misprint or omission when "II" is used twice. But the words that have been used are "Sc~

Q>@C)@" and "0~(5)~ ~~ Se)" which makes it clear that the Minister was actually conferring

the powers set out in Column III to the Respondent including powers under section 59 of the Law

from the dates specified in Column II. The Order must be construed as a whole to ascertain its

true meaning.

The other ground urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant is that in terms of section 58(1)

of the Law, a registered society can make a reference to the Registrar to appoint an arbitrator

only where there is a dispute touching the business of the registered society but the dispute in

the instant case pCi-tains to a fraud which is not covered by the said provision.

For the reasons set out above, this is not a position that can be taken before the Magistrates

Court. In any event, the Appellant took part in the arbitration proceedings without demur and

cannot now contest the validity of such proceedings.

For the foregoi~g reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned High

Court Judge of Matara dated 5th October 2004.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
