Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner was the Accountant of the Medical Supplies Division

of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine. After

the preliminary inquiry, he was interdicted by the 2nd respondent-

Acting Secretary of the Ministry by the letter dated 21.10.2015

marked P9 on the basis inter alia that he violated Government

Financial Regulations in making a certain payment. The petitioner

filed this application seeking (a) to quash P9 by way of a writ of

certiorari and (b) to direct the 1st respondent-Secretary of the

Ministry to hold an appropriate inquiry or in the alternative to

reinstate the petitioner by way of a writ of mandamus. The 1st

respondent filed objections to this application. Hence this

Judgment.

The said payment has been made on the decision of the relevant

Procurement Committee of the Health Ministry marked P8, which

the petitioner as the Accountant has certified as a true copy. It

3

has later been revealed that P8 is partly forged in that the

signature of the Secretary to the Ministry, which is required to

complete the process, has been forged. The subject clerk has later

accepted the liability for forging the document.

It is the position of the petitioner that as a member who

participated in that Procurement Committee, he knew the

correctness of the entries in P8 to be completely accurate and

hence he had no reason to suspect the document P8 when he

approved the payment voucher and there is no financial loss

whatsoever caused to the Government due to any action taken by

him and therefore there is no misconduct on his part warranting

interdiction pending formal disciplinary inquiry.

The principal argument of learned President's Counsel for the

petitioner is that, according to the Government Gazette No.

1733/52 dated 25.11.2011 marked A3, it is the Deputy Secretary

to the Treasury and not the Secretary to the Health Ministry who

had the authority to interdict the petitioner and therefore the

interdiction by the Secretary to the Ministry by P8 is a nullity and

has no force or avail in law.

The 17th Amendment to the Constitution which came into force on

03.10.2001 repealed Chapter IX of the Constitution and replaced a

new Chapter containing Articles 54-61 in regard to the Public

Service Commission.

According to Article 55 of the Constitution, the appointment,

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public

officers shall be vested in the Public Service Commission.

Article 57(1) states that the Public Service Commission may

delegate such powers to a public officer subject to conditions, and

4

Article 57(2) enacts that the Commission shall cause any such

delegation of powers to be published in the Gazette.

It is noteworthy that by the Gazette marked A3, the Public Service

Commission has delegated disciplinary control of the public

officers of the Sri Lanka Accountant Service such as the petitioner

to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury only in respect of offences

contained in the second schedule to Chapter XLVIII of the

Establishment Code, and therefore in respect of offences contained

in the first schedule, the Public Service Commission has retained

its authority.

Article 61B of the Constitution states that all rules, regulations

and procedures relating to the public service as were in force on

the date of the coming into operation of that Chapter shall be

deemed to continue in force until the Public Service Commission

otherwise provides.

The petitioner was interdicted under section 31 of Chapter XLVIII

of the Establishment Code whereby inter alia a Secretary to a

Ministry is empowered to interdict a public officer on certain acts

of misconduct subject to the covering approval of the Disciplinary

Authority, which is the Public Service Commission.

According to the letter of interdiction marked P9, one of the

offences committed by the petitioner is an alleged violation of

Government Financial Regulation No.137, which is an offence falls

in the First Schedule to Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code.

Hence the argument of learned President's Counsel for the

petitioner that interdiction was made by the Secretary to the

Ministry without any authority and therefore is a nullity is not

entitled to succeed.

5

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner then makes a

detailed analysis of facts to say that the petitioner has committed

no offence and he has acted right throughout bona fide and

therefore the decision to chargesheet the petitioner for an offence

falling under the First Schedule to Chapter XLVIII of the

Establishment Code and to interdict the petitioner pending formal

inquiry is manifestly unreasonable and irrational.

Notwithstanding in my view there is force in that submission, I

must say that this Court in the exercise of writ jurisdiction is not

expected to enter too much into the arena meant for the

disciplinary authority and endeavour to substitute the views of this

Court in place of those of the disciplinary authority especially

when the formal disciplinary inquiry is underway, unless the

impugned decision is outrageously unreasonable or irrational.

In judicial review, unreasonableness or irrationality is assessed by

the standard of unreasonableness set out in Associated Provincial

Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation1, which is commonly

known as "Wednesbury unreasonableness". It applies to a decision

which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral

standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the

question to be decided could have arrived at it. (Council of Civil

Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service2) Given the fact that

the payment was made on a document later proved to be a forged

one, which the petitioner as the Accountant had certified as a true

copy, I doubt whether this Court can say that the decision is

irrational or perverse according to Wednesbury standard

notwithstanding there are forceful mitigating circumstances,

2 [1984] 3 All ER 935

6

which, I am certain, the disciplinary authority will take into

account at the end of the formal disciplinary inquiry.

After filing this application, the Public Service Commission being

the Disciplinary Authority of the petitioner has by R5 dated

11.01.2016 granted covering approval to the decision of the

Secretary to the Ministry contained in P9.

The Public Service Commission is not a party to this application

nor can its decisions be challenged before this Court except by way

of a fundamental rights application in the Supreme Court in view

of Article 61A of the Constitution.

In the said circumstances, writ of certiorari cannot be issued to

quash P9.

Writ of mandamus directing the 1st respondent Secretary to the

Ministry to hold an appropriate inquiry or in the alternative to

reinstate the petitioner cannot also be issued for obvious reasons.

On the one hand, the petitioner was interdicted after a preliminary

inquiry and formal disciplinary inquiry is now in progress. On the

other, interdiction once approved by the Public Service

Commission cannot be lifted by the Secretary to the Ministry.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
