Decided on: 01.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The defendant-appellant has filed this appeal against the order

of the learned Additional District Judge of Monaragala dated

07.02.1996 whereby the application of the defendant to set aside

the ex parte Judgment entered against her was dismissed.

Before the matter was taken up for argument, the appellant

made an application in terms of section 773 of the Civil

Procedure Code to adduce fresh evidence in appeal. The fresh

evidence is to tender some documents to show that, with regard

to the same subject matter, there was a subsequent litigation

between the same parties, and it was finally decided in favour of

the appellant.

Even if this is correct, it has nothing to do with the instant

appeal, which is, as I stated earlier, against the refusal to vacate

the Judgment entered ex parte.

3

At this stage, the Court will only consider, in terms of section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, whether there were reasonable

grounds for such default. The merits of the case of the appellant

will not be considered at this stage.

It is well settled law that an ex parte Judgment cannot be

canvassed on merits before the District Court or before this

Court on appeal, except in a revision application filed before this

Court. In fact, if the defaulter is successful in purging default,

the Judgment will automatically be set aside regardless of its

merits. (Vide Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake v. Times of Ceylon

Limited [1995] 1 Sri LR at 34-35, Arumugam v. Kumaraswamy

[2000] BLR 55)

In Ladd v. Marshall (1954) 3 All ER 745 at 748 Lord Justice

Denning stated as follows:

In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial,

three conditions mast be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the

evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence

for use at the trial: second, the evidence most be such that, if

given, it would probably have an important influence on the result

of the case, though it need not be decisive: thirdly, the evidence

must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words,

it must be apparently credible, though it need not be

incontrovertible.

This test has consistently been adopted and applied by our

Courts when deciding whether or not fresh evidence shall be

allowed in appeal. (vide Ratwatte v. Bandara (1966) 70 NLR 231,

Beatrice Dep v. Lalani Meemaduwa [1997] 3 Sri LR 379, Rev.

Kiralagama Sumanatissa Thero v. Aluwihare [1985] 1 Sri LR 19,

Wijeyakoon v. Wijeyakoon [1986] 2 Sri LR 325, Ekanayake v.

Ratranhamy [2012] BLR 19, Jayasekera v. Appuhamy CA

No.250/1997(F) decided on 14.10.2011, Agnes v. Piyasena CA

No.731/1993(F) decided on 27.09.2007)

There is no doubt that the appellant is unable to satisfy the

second requirement.

If the appellant thinks that the subsequent litigation finally

decided the rights of the parties in respect of the same subject

matter and therefore this appeal is redundant, the appellant can

simply withdraw this appeal without further ado.

For the aforesaid reasons, the application of the appellant dated

10.03.2018 to adduce fresh evidence in appeal is dismissed with

costs.
