This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge

of Panadura in respect of a partition action Number P 18725.

.' " ,

The original Plaintiff Mohammed Marikkar Abdul Jaleel instituted

this action seeking to partition the land called "Gala Udawatta"

described in the schedule to the plaint and depicted in Plan Number

1875 dated 27.02.1985 made by Y.B.K. Costa Licensed Surveyor.

And the original Plaintiff relied upon the pedigree which has set out

in the plaint.

According to the original Plaintiffs pedigree and undivided 1/3

share originally belonged to Awl Le b be Marikkar Kasi Le b be

Marikkar and the balance undivided 2/3 original Plaintiff share was

originally owned by Hadji Marlkkar Mohammed Haniffa and from

the original owners shares devolved in the manner set out in the

Plaint.

The substituted-Plaintiff had been substituted after the demise of

the original Plaintiff. According to the plaint the undivided shares

of the land to be partitioned devolve on the parties as follow;

Plaintiff to an undivided share of 1/6

1st defendant to an undivided share of 2/6

2nd and 3rd defendants to an undivided share of 2/6

4

, .

4th defendant to an undivided share of 1/6

And the 4th and 5th defendants admitted the plaintiffs narration of

the chain of title in the paragraph 01-18 of the plaint but claim to

the Lot depicted as 'R' in Sinhalese in the preliminary plan marked

as 'X' and the 4th defendant is entitled to all the building therein.

It is noted that there was no contest regarding the corpus depicted

as lot ~ d e and E).

But the contest was regarding the devolution of title and how the

buildings standing in the particular 'Gala Udawatta' should be

allocated to the parties.

Further 5th defendant claims the prescriptive posseSSIon and

evidenced that he had possessed the middle lot 'R' in Sinhalese and

for a period over fourty years, whereas the plaintiff did not have

proper possession and also the 5th defendant stated that he had

built a house in 1952, which has been supported by the documents

and assessment register of the local authority.

Upon the conclusion of trial the learned District Jude of Panadura

dismissed the action and took up a position that the 4th and 5th

5

" .

defendants are entitled to Lot "R" along with the buildings and

cultivation thereon. The learned District Judge of Panadura also

held that the plaintiff has not been proved his stance.

The substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant being dissatisfied with the

judgment of the leaner District Judge of Panduara appealed and

prayed to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Panadura one among the ground stating that the learned District

Judge of Panduara has failed to give reasons and failed to evaluate

the evidence correctly and as a result he has misdirected himself on

the law and facts.

It is important to identify that whether the 4th and 5th defendants

have possessed and entitled to lot "R" along with the building and

cultivation thereon.

Section 3 of the Prescription ordinance Act No.2 of 1889 the

claimant must prove.

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession.

2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant

Plaintiff and

6

3. Ten years previous to the bringing of a such action.

In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a

change in the nature of the possession and the party claiming

prescriptive right should show an ouster.*********

But the 4th and 5th defendants argued that the 5th defendant has

occupied the house adverse to the title of any other and have

acquired prescriptive rights to the same.

In Sirajudeen and Two Others V.Abbas (1994) 2 SLR 365 the

Supreme Court has observed thus:

'As regards to the mode of proof of prescriptive posseSSIon, mere

general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land

in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prospective period

are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription, it is necessary that the

witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of

possession has to be decided thereupon by court".

7

' ..

"One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provide for in Section 3 of the Prescription ordinance is proof of

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of

such character as is incompatible with the title of the owner."

In Corea Vs Iseris Appuhamy ( 1911) 15 NLR 65 the Privy Council

decision laid down for the first time in clear and authoritative terms

of the following principles:

1. The possession of one co-owner, was in law, the

possession of others,

2. Every co-owner must be presumed to be possessing in that

Capacity,

3. It was not possible for such a co-owner to put an end to

that title and to initiate a prescriptive title by any secret

intention in his own mind and

4. That nothing short of an ouster, could bring about that

8

r

. /

result.

Wickremaratne And Anothers Vs. Alpenis Perera1986 1 SLR

190 held that, in a partition action for a lot of land claimed by

the plaintiff to be divided portion of a larger land, he must

adduce proof that the co-owner who originated the division

and such co-owner's successors had prescribed to that divided

portion by adverse possession for at least ten years from the

date of ouster or something equivalent to ouster. Where such

co-owner had himself executed deeds for undivided shares of

the larger land after the year of the alleged dividing off it will

militate against the plea of prescription. Possession of divided

portions by different co-owners is in no way in consistent with

common possesslon.

A co - owner's possession is in law the possession of other co-

owners very co-owners is presumed to be in possession in his

capacity as co-owner. A co - owner cannot put an end to his

posseSSlon as co-owner by a secret intention in his mind.

Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster

could bring about the result.

9

, .

It is noted that the contention of the 4th and 5th defendants

was that they are entitled to the Lot "R" and the 5th defendant

build a house in that said Lot and thus the said lot been

prescribe by them and 5th defendant admitted in his evidence

that the plaintiff gave money to build the house which they

had been in possession.

The substituted plaintiff and that his father who was the

original plaintiff and his uncle who was the 5th defendant,

built the house together and carried out a business as well.

The 4th defendant who was the wife of the 5th defendant.

In Chelliah Vs. Wijendran 54 NLR 337 at 342 Gratien J

observed" whereas a party invokes the provisions of Section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership

of an adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of

proof rests fairly and squarely on him to establish the starting

point of his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights".

Justice Janak de Silva in Muaththananda Ponnamperumage

Dhanayake Vs. Nanayakkaravasam and Other C.A. 1340/99 F

observed that in our society family relationships are

considered important and attracts a certain degree of trust. A

family member is trusted more than an outsider. Courts

appear to have taken this into consideration on the question of

adverse possession in a claim of prescriptive title.

In De Silva V. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue 80

NLR 292 Sharvananda J. clearly and deeply observed that,

"The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the

real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the

possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner.

The acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable

with the rights of the true owner; the person in possession

must claimed to be so as of right as against the true owner.

Where there is no hostility to a denial of the title of the true

11

f

owner there can be no adverse posseSSIon. In deciding

whether the alleged acts of the person constitute adverse

possession, regard must be ascertained from the facts and

circumstances of each case and the relationship of the parties.

Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in the

case of a stranger may not attract such a presumption, in

the case of persons standing in certain social or legal

relationships. The presumption represents the most likely

inference that may be drawn in the context of the

relationship of the parties. The court will always attribute

possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where

the possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be

assumed, in the absence of evidence, that the possession is

lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is held

by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the

son was on behalf of and with the permission of the mother.

Such permissive possession is not in denial of the title of the

mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It will not

enable the possession to acquire title by adverse possession.

Where possession commenced with permission, it will be

12

.... . .

presumed to so continue until and unless something

adverse occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to

show when and how the possession became adverse.

Continued appropriation of income and payment of taxes

will not be sufficient to convert permissive possession into

adverse possession, unless such conduct unequivocally

manifests denial of the perimeter's title. In order to

discharge such onus, there must be clear and affirmative

evidence of the change in the character of the possession.

The evidence must point to the time of commencement of

adverse possession. Where the parties were not at arm's

length, strong evidence of a positive character is

necessary to establish the change of character."

In view of Maria Fernando & Others V. Anthony Fernando

(1997)2 SLR 356 Court of Appeal held that,

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes enjoyment of

produce, filling suit without making the adverse party a party,

preparing a plan and building house on land renting it are not

enough to establish prescription among co-owners in the

13

~ , f

absence of an over act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe

may not amount to ouster."

Also in Dias Abeysinghe V. Dias Abeysinghe and Two others

34 CLW 69 (SC) observed that,

"That, where a co-owner erects a new building on the common

land and remains in possession thereof for over ten years, he

does not acquire prescriptive right to the building and the soil on

which it stands as against the other co-owners merely by such

possession. "

It is clear that these general principles analyzed that the

improvements, renovations made in common land or a

building cannot be establish prescriptive title against other co-

owners.

The learned district judge of Panad ura was misdirected

himself in deciding the building constructed by the 5th

defendant and failed to consider the family relationship among

the parties in order to decide the adverse possession under

prescriptive title.

14

, ..

It is submitted by the Plaintiff-Appellant that no reasons have

been given at all by the learned district judge as to why he

accepted the evidence on behalf of the 4th and 5th defendants

and rejected the evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff and

moreover he has failed to give reasons as to why he had come

to the above findings. And also he has failed to appreciate the

identity of this original Plaintiff Abdul Jaleel by carefully

examining the documents produced at the Trial.

In Dona Lucihamy Vs Cicilyahamy 59 NLR 214 at 216

mentioned that bare answers to the issues or points of contest

whatever may be the name given to them are insufficient

unless all matters which arise for decision under each head

are examined.

In Warnakula Vs.Ramani Jayawardena (1990) 1 Sri L R 206

stated that evidence germane to each issue must be reviewed

or examined.

In Sopinona Vs Pitipanaarachchi (2010) 1 Sri L R 88 observed

that answering only points of contest raised by one party in a

partition action and failing to consider the points of contest

15

\

raised by other parties amounts to denial of justice to the

latter parties for fault of theirs. Failure to consider the deeds

and other documents produced by the respondents at the trial

leads to the conclusion, considering the rights of the

respondents, there had in fact been a miscarriage of justice.

And also justice Janak De Silva In Muththananda

Ponnamperumage Dhanayaka Vs Nanayakaravasam and

Ohters CA 1340/99F further stated that the context of

perfunctory judgments compliance with Section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code and held that the Learned District Judge

has not referred to his evidence in the judgment.

I am of the view that, the Learned District Judge has

misdirected himself and given bare answers to some of the

issues without evaluating the evidence and failed to adduce

reasons.

I am of the firm VIew, that the learned district judge of

Panadura had erred in his conclusion and it is noted that the

shares should be done according to the pedigree which had

been submitted and annexed in the plaint and the 4th and 5th

16

defendants had failed to prove their adverse posseSSIon to

establish the prescriptive title to the Lot 'R' and its buildings,

cultivations thereon in accordance with the settled law.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the

learned district judge of Panadura delivered in 20/ 11/ 1996

and allow the appeal in favour of the Plaintiff.
