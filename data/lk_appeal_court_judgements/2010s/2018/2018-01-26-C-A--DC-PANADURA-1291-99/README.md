Janak De Silva J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (deceased) (hereinafter referred to as "Plaintiff") filed the above action in

the District Court of Panadura seeking to partition the land more fully described in the schedule

to the plaint.

The Plaintiff claimed that the original owner of the said land was one Morawakkoralalage

Madappuhamy Fonseka (hereinafter referred to as "Madappuhamy") who died leaving four

children Adwin, James, Maggie and Cornelia who inherited an undivided X share each of the said

land. The case of the Plaintiff was that he had acquired the rights of James, Maggie and Cornelia

and thereby acquired an undivided % share of the said land while the pt to 5th Defendants in the

District Court had acquired the rights of Adwin and were entitled to the respective shares set out

in the plaint. The Plaintiff, in addition to his paper title, pleaded prescriptive title to an undivided

% share of the corpus.

The 2nd to 6th defendants (hereinafter referred to as "2nd to 6th Defendants") denied the title of

the Plaintiff. They claimed that the land described in the schedule to the plaint is a smaller portion

of a larger land 6 paddy bushel sowing extent which amounts to 3 acres. They stated that the

larger land was owned by two brothers and that Adwin, James, Maggie and Cornelia were

descendants of one brother. It was further claimed that the descendants of the original owners

of the larger land had in lieu of their undivided rights possessed divided portions over a long

period of time and thereby acquired prescriptive title to the said portions one of which is the land

sought to be partitioned.

The learned Additional District Judge of Panadura held that the Plaintiff had failed to establish

the pedigree pleaded and dismissed the action with costs. Hence this appeal by the Plaintiff.

The conclusion of the learned Additional District Judge on the pedigree is closely connected to

the description of the land and therefore it is important to examine it as described in the schedule

to the plaint.

The schedule to the plaint identifies the corpus to be partitioned as follows:

The said land is shown in the preliminary plan made in this case marked "X" which shows an

extent of R.2 P.13.3. This is the same land shown in preliminary plan no. 240(512q) made in D.C.

Panadura case no. 19123/P filed by the brother of the Plaintiff Armis Fernando which will be

adverted to later. The Plaintiff admits that the larger land called Eriyagahaowita is 6 paddy bushel

sowing extent which amounts to 3 acres. The schedule to the plaint states that the corpus sought

to be partitioned is the larger land less the land shown in plan no. 623 dated 29.04.1935 (01.2).

The extent of land shown in plan no. 623 dated 29.04.1935 (01.2) is A.O R.1 P.32. Hence if the

Plaintiff is correct on the extent of land sought to be partitioned in this action, the total extent of

the lands depicted in preliminary plan marked "X" and plan no. 623 (01.2) should be 3 acres. But

A.O R.1 P.32. added to R.2 P.13.3 is only A.1 R.O P. 5.3 which is only 1/3 of the larger land called

Eriyagahaowita leaving nearly 2 acres unaccounted for. It is in this context that the learned

District Judge correctly concluded that there are more portions of Eriyagahaowita than what is

described in the schedule to the plaint.

The above conclusion is based upon the assumption that the larger land called Eriyagahaowita is

6 paddy bushel sowing extent which amounts to 3 acres. I have previously quoted with approval 1

Ratnayake and others v. Kumarihamy and others2 where the Court of Appeal held that the

customary Sinhala system of land measure computed according to the extent of land required to

sow with paddy or kurakkan vary due to the interaction of several factors and that in the

circumstances it is difficult to correlate sowing extent accurately by reference to surface areas. 3

However, in this case even if allowance is given to this variability, the difference of nearly two

acres is too significant to disregard, particularly taking into consideration the circumstances of

this case and in D.C. Panadura Case No. 19123/P instituted by Armis Fernando, the brother of the

Plaintiff.

It was admitted by the Plaintiff that Armis Fernando filed the said D.C. Panadura Case No.

19123/P against several defendants including the 2nd to 6th Defendants in this case. The facts of

that case impacts on this case both on the identity of the land and in establishing the pedigree.

The schedule to the said plaint (e59) described the land sought to be partitioned in that case as

On a comparison of the two schedules to the plaint in this case and D.C. Panadura Case No.

19123/P, it is clear that the land sought to be partitioned in the two cases are the same. In fact,

the Plaintiff admitted this under cross-examination. Of course, Armis Fernando transferred all his

rights to the Plaintiff before the present partition action was filed. But the facts in the said D.C.

Panadura Case No. 19123/P assists in understanding the conclusions of the learned Additional

District Judge in this case on the identity of the corpus and the pedigree.

The said Armis Fernando, later sought to amend the plaint in the said D.C. Panadura Case No.

19123/P. The amended plaint filed in that case was marked as 51 in this case. The amended plaint

described the land sought to be partitioned as follows:

In the original plaint (59), Armis Fernando claimed that the land Eriyagahaowita sought to be

partitioned was owned by Madappuhamy. The amended plaint (51) changed this position and

claimed that Madappuhamy was the owner of only 1/4th of the larger land called Eriyagahaowita.

This amended plaint was rejected by order of court (510). The reason was that the plaintiff was

seeking to bring in a new land to the partition action. Thereafter Armis Fernando sought to

withdraw the said partition action reserving his right to file a separate action which was allowed

subject to a pre-payment order (511).

7

Armis Fernando relied upon deeds ol.6 to ol.9 and ol.l1 to establish his pedigree in D.C.

Panadura Case No. 19123/P (e39). The Plaintiff also relies on the same deeds to establish his

pedigree in this case. All of the said deeds describe the land it applies to firstly as the balance

portion and secondly as the undivided portion of Eriyagahaowita having 6 paddy bushel sowing

extent less the land in plan no. 623 (ol.2). This is not possible for the reasons explained earlier. It

appears that Armis Fernando realized that he could not maintain the original plaint (e39) filed in

D.C. Panadura Case No. 19123/P without including the rest of the "balance portion" of

Eriyagahaowita.

Since the amended plaint was rejected, there seems to have been an attempt to overcome this

difficulty. Armis Fernando sold his rights to the Plaintiff in this action by deed no. 749 (ol.lO). The

notary who attested the said deed and the lawyer for the Plaintiff in this case was one and the

same. As the Counsel for 2nd to 6th Defendants submitted, ol'lO is a "cleverly crafted" deed to

attempt and get over the difficulty Armis Fernando faced in D.C. Panadura Case No. 19123/P. In

ol'lO it was attempted to identify the land in plan no. 240 as the separated balance portion of

Eriyagahaowita (<g>l535 ~Z5):J()e:l~ OOc.:J(D(S)S)() i53c.:J25) <g>e;)~@ ~e)2rl~ Z5)1Q)IGCd e)25)). The deeds

which form the basis for ol'lO described the land as undivided whereas ol.10 sought to describe

it as separated balance portion in an attempt to get the said deeds to apply to land in plan no.

240 and thereby to the land in the preliminary plan made in this case marked "X".

The surveyor who prepared the preliminary pan marked "X" in this case has, in the survey report

marked "Xl", stated that the land he surveyed is the land described in the schedule to the plaint.

I have previously adverted to the importance of the survey report in the light of Section 18(2) of

the Partition Law.4 However, the circumstances of this case, including the schedule to the deeds

marked ol.6 to ol.9 and ol.!l, clearly raises serious doubts about the accuracy of the description

of the land and pedigree pleaded by the Plainitff. In these circumstances, the learned Additional

District Judge was correct in determining that the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff is unclear.

t

The argument made on behalf of the 2nd to 6th Defendants is that the larger land Eriyagahaowita

had been separately possessed by the owners and the land shown in the preliminary plan marked

"X" is the land possessed by Morawakkoralalage Adwin Fonseka Abeykoon and his descendants

as a separate land. This appears to have been accepted by the learned Additional District Judge

in dismissing the Plaintiff's case. Support for this position is found in the survey report to plan no.

240 (12) made in D.C. Panadura case No. 19123/P. The report indicates that all the buildings

and the plantation was claimed by the defendants and Armis Fernando, the brother of the

Plaintiff, only claimed that he had bought part of the land.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law requires the court to examine the title of each party and hear

and receive evidence in support thereof. It has been consistently held that it is the duty of the

Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the judgement is a judgement

in rem. In Gnanapandithen and another v. Balanayagam and anotherS G.P.S. De Silva c.J.

explained this duty as follows:

"Mr. Samarasekera cited several decisions which have, over the years, emphasized the

paramount duty cast on the court by the statute itself to investigate title. It is unnecessary

to repeat those decisions here. For present purposes it would be sufficient to refer to the

case of Mather v. Thamotharam Pillai (2) decided as far back as 1903, where Layard, CJ.

stated the principle in the following term: - "Now, the question to be decided in a partition

suit is not merely matters between parties which may be decided in a civil action; ...

The court has not only to decide the matters in which the parties are in dispute, but to

safeguard the interests of others who are not parties to the suit, who will be bound by

a decree for partition ... "Layard, CJ. stressed the importance of the duty cast on the

court to satisfy itself "that the plaintiff has made out a title to the land sought to be

partitioned, and that the parties before the court are those solely entitled to such land."

(emphasis added). "6

I am of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to fulfill the burden cast upon him.

I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Panadura dated 23rd November 1999 and dismiss the appeal with costs.
