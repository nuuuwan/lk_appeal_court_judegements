I JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Officer in Charge of Kalawana Police Station had filed the information

relevant to this case in the Primary Court under section 66 (1) (a) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as

the Act).

6

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this information, by his

order dated 2014-05-07, had held that the 1st Party Respondent - Petitioner

- Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Party

Respondent) has failed to prove that he is entitled to use the impugned

right of way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

1 st Party Respondent had filed a revision application in the Provincial High

Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura urging the Provincial

High Court to revise the order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing the parties, by its judgment dated

2015-07-27 had allowed the saId application and revised the order of the

learned Primary Court Judge holding that the 1st Party Respondent is

entitled to use a six feet wide roadway to enable him to take a three

wheeler vehicle.

It is against that judgment that the 2nd Party Respondent - Respondent -

Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Party Appellants)

have filed this appeal in this Court.

7

In coming to the conclusion that the 1st party Respondent has failed to

prove his entitlement to the impugned right of way, the learned Primary

Court Judge has considered the following facts;

i. the fact that the 1st Party Respondent has not adduced any evidence

to establish that any Court of law has granted him a right of way by

any order of Court,

ii. the fact that the deeds produced by the 1st Party Respondent marked

1 f) 1 and 1 f) 2 do not show that any such right of way has been

granted by the said deeds relied upon by the 1st Party Respondent,

iii. the fact that the relevant land is an undivided co-owned land,

iv. the fact that the documeht produced by the 1st Party Respondent

marked 1 f) 3 also does not indicate granting such a right of way to

him,

v. the fact that the electricity meter reader of the area in his affidavit

has specifically stated that he had not used the impugned roadway to

go to various houses in the area to read the electriCity meters,

vi. the fact that the 1st Party Respondent has stated in his statement

that he cut this road forcibly, and

8

vii. the fact that the 1st Party Respondent has stated that the 2nd Party

Appellants had only granted him a temporary access road for the

purpose of transporting building material to the site where he was

constructing his house.

Further, the Perusal of the learned Primary Court Judge's order shows that

the learned Primary Court Judge with the concurrence of the parties, had

decided to inspect the relevant roadway. It appears that the learned

Primary Court Judge had been in a better position to resolve the dispute in

the instant case as he had visited the disputed road way and seen for

himself the prevailing ground situation there.

It is on the strength of the above factual positions that it had become

possible for the learned Primary Court Judge to conclude that the 1st Party

Respondent is not entitled to use the impugned right of way.

It would be appropriate at this juncture for this Court to turn to the

judgment of the Provincial High Court. As opposed to the learned primary

Court Judge who has considered all the admissible material placed before

him, the learned High Court Judge in her order has placed reliance only on

some photographs and some contents in the notes of observations made

by the police officers who had visited the scene. It is on those photographs

9

and the Police observation notes that the learned Provincial High Court

Judge had set aside the learned Primary Court Judge's order and held that

the 1st Party Respondent is entitled to use the impugned road way.

This Court is of the view that the photographs and the police observation

notes at their best would only establish the fact that there is a roadway at

some location at some point of time. The said point of time is the time of

making such photographs or observation notes. The mere fact of the

existence of a roadway cannot by itself confer any right to a third party to

use that road. This Court has to underline the importance of differentiating

'the proof of existence of a road by the evidence collected after the dispute

had arisen' and 'the proof of entitlement for a party to use such a road' .

They are two concepts, which are completely different from one another. It

is the view of this Court that the learned Provincial High Court Judge has

fallen into a grave error in her judgement as she had failed to appreciate

the above distinction.

This Court in the case of Galison Dodwell Jayasuriya Vs Vijayamuni

Kaluhami and four others! had upheld a similar position. This Court is of

the view that it would be in place to reproduce the following portion from

1 C A (PHC) / APN 99/2015, decided on 2017 - 09 - 11.

10

that judgment. It would highlight the dangers posed by relying on the

material such as photographs and Police observation notes in deciding

whether a party is entitled to a right of way. The relevant portion is as

follow.

" ... Perusal of the judgment of the learned Magistrate dated 2012-04-20

shows that the conclusions contained in the said judgment are based on

some photographs, Police observation notes including a sketch produced

by Police, and some writings tendered by persons who claim to have used

the impugned roadway.

It must be borne in mind that the relevant land is a big coconut land. The

position taken up by the Petitioner who is the owner of this land is that the

existing roadway is a road that is being used for transportation of coconut

etc. inside his land. It must be remembered at the outset that the mere

existence of a roadway across this land cannot by itself give a right for

others also to use it. However, it can be seen that the learned Magistrate

as well as the learned High Court Judge have heavily relied on the fact that

there exists a roadway within the land. This Court has to observe that both

the Courts have failed to appreciate the fact that the existence of a

roadway by itself cannot be any license for others to claim an entitlement

11

to use it. Further, even if the Respondents have used it, a mere user by

itself would not get an entitlement to use it.2 ......... "

It would also be helpful at this stage to reproduce the following passage

from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramalingam V

Thangarajah3 , which had interpreted the above provision of law. It is as

follows;

" ..... On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land

other than right of possession of such land, the question for decision,

according to section 69 (i), is who is entitled to the right which is subject

of dispute. The word "entitle" here connotes the ownership of the right.

The Court has to determine which of the parties has acquired that right, or

is entitled for the time being to exercise that right. In contradistinction to

section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine the question which

party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an order under

section 69 (2) ...... "

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court concludes

that the 1st Party Respondent has failed to prove any ownership of the

2 M D Siriyawathie Jayasinghe V K A Karunarathne, CA (APN) No. 863/90, Decided on 1997-06-04.

3 1982 (2) Sri. L R 693.

12

impugned right. Therefore, the Provincial High Court could not have

granted any right of way to the 1st Party Respondent.

This Court also need to mention here the judgment relied upon by the

learned Provincial High Court Judge (C A (PHC) APN 117/2013, decided on

2014-08-07) has no application in a situation where there is no evidence to

prove any entitlement of the disputed right.

One has to be mindful that in the instant case, what the Provincial High

Court was called upon to exercise, was its revisionary jurisdiction.

As has been held by this Court in the case of Jayasekarage Bandulasena

and others Vs Galla Kankanamge Chaminda and others4, revisionary

I jurisdiction can be exercised to satisfy the revisionary Court as to the

legality of any order, to satisfy itself as to the propriety of any order or to

satisfy itself as to the regularity of the proceeding before the lower Court.

The provisional nature of the orders made by Primary Court under part VII

of the Act was highlighted by this Court in the case of Punchi Nona V

Padumasena and othersS in following terms.

4 C A (PHC) 147 /2009 decided on 2017-09-27. 51994 (2) Sri. L R 117.

13

" The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of

the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace

arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession, which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court ... "

The available material clearly demonstrate that there had been no illegality,

irregularity or any impropriety in the impugned order pronounced by the

learned Primary Court Judge. Therefore, it is clear that the Provincial High ,

Court has had no ground to interfere with the order of the learned Primary

Court Judge in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.

In this backdrop, this Court is convinced that there has been no legal basis

for the learned Provincial High Court Judge to exercise his revisionary

powers to vary the findings of the Primary Court.

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides

to set aside the judgement of the Provincial High Court pronounced on

14

2015-07-27 and proceed to restore the order dated 2014-05-07

Pronounced by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Appellants are entitled to the costs of all litigations.

Appeal is allowed with costs.
