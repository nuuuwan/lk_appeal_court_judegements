Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application against the Respondentthe

National Transport Commissionseeking (a) to quash by way of

certiorari the decision of the Respondent dated 20.11.2015

whereby the Petitioner was informed that the Respondent would

remove the Petitioners Seat Reservation Office at the Bastian

Mawatha Bus Terminal, and (b) to compel by way of mandamus

to allow the Petitioner to continue with that business, and not to

allow that business to be carried on by the Respondent itself or

to give it to any other party.

It is the position of the Petitioner that he has been running this

business of reserving seats for bus commuters for a fee, for a

long time at the Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal with the

permission of the then Chairman of the National Transport

Commission (vide X1) in a container for which he paid the rental

in a sum of Rs. 39,200/= per month to the container company

in the name of the National Transport Commission (vide X2

series). According to him, thereafter, with the acknowledgement

of the subject Minister and the direction of the National

Transport Commission (vide X3), he bought the container for a

sum of Rs. 350,000/= from the container company (vide X4) and

carried on the business until he was informed by the

Respondent to remove the container and stop running the

business (vide X5 and X9).

Conversely, it is the position of the Respondent that the

Petitioner has no right to continue the business of running the

Seat Reservation Center in the Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal.

The Respondent does not admit X1 and X3the two important

3

documents the Petitioner heavily relies on to seek the said

reliefs.

In the first place, when major facts are in dispute, writ,

especially mandamus, does not lie.

Be that as it may, the Petitioner tendered X1 dated 04.01.2012

to say that he was given permission by the then Chairman of the

National Transport Commission to carry on the business.

However, X1 cannot be construed as a formal grant or

permission binding upon the Respondent to allow the Petitioner

to carry on that business in the Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal.

It is a letter written by the Petitioner to the then Chairman of the

National Transport Commission stating or suggesting some

conditions to carry on the business in the Bus Terminal wherein

there is an illegible two or three word endorsement (if I read

correctly, Manager Bastian Mw) with the signature of

somebody.

X3 is denied by the Respondent inter alia stating that there is

not even a reference number in the letter, suggesting that it is a

forged or unofficial letter.

In any event, according to that letter X3, the then Chairman of

the National Transport Commission has informed the Subject

Minister that the Petitioner was given the permission to continue

with the business upon the instructions given by the said

Minister and also the Petitioner was informed to buy the

container from the container company.

It is not clear on what basis the Minister has given instructions

to the then Chairman of the National Transport Commission to

allow the Petitioner to continue the business in the Bus

4

Terminal and, if so, for how long. The Minister is not a party to

this application to ascertain, first, the genuineness of that

document, and second, the basis to give such instructions, and

third, for how long that permission was given, as that

permission cannot in any event be forever.

The Respondent by tendering R4A and R4B states that, the

Petitioner was given permission to operate a Seat Reservation

Center only for the Bus Route from Wellawatte to Jaffna for a

period of six months from 01.04.2011, which has now long

lapsed, and he has no lawful right to operate any such business

at Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal.

The Petitioner has been informed from time to time to remove

the structures and to stop operation of carrying out the business

although the Petitioner has tendered only two of such letters

marked X5 dated 12.06.2015 and X9 dated 20.11.2015.

The Respondent has tendered a letter marked R5 dated

20.06.2013 informing the Petitioner to stop operation of that

business. That letter also refers to an earlier letter dated

15.05.2013 sent to the Petitioner asking the same.

The documents marked R8A and R8B were tendered by the

Respondent to say that the National Transport Commission

decided to operate the Seat Reservation Center in the Bastian

Mawatha Bus Terminal from 01.12.2015 (vide X9).

The Petitioner has filed this application on 02.12.2015 and

obtained an ex parte stay order against the Respondent

preventing the Respondent from removing his office at Bastian

Mawatha Bus Terminal, which is in operation up to now.

5

The Petitioners demand, not to allow even the National

Transport Commission to operate the Seat Reservation Center,

but to allow only to him to carry out that business forever is

unreasonable to say the least.

According to the Petitioner (vide X7), he is carrying on this

business in the Bus Terminal for about 30 years. However,

there is no formal permission given to the Petitioner to carry on

such business except R4A and R4B tendered by the Respondent,

which has long lapsed. He cannot be allowed to continue that

business forever against the wishes of the present Management.

The National Transport Commission has been asking the

Petitioner at least from 2013 (vide R5) to vacate the place, but

the Petitioner has been continuously defying it.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not think that

the decision of the Respondent to disallow the Petitioner to

operate the Seat Reservation Center (in order for the Respondent

itself to carry on the business) is illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary

or mala fide. There is no legal basis to issue certiorari and/or

mandamus against the Respondent.

Application is dismissed with costs.
