Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Romesh de Silva, P.C., with S.V. Niles for the

Petitioner.

Asthika Devendra with Kaneel Maddumage for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 17.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus

compelling the 1st and/or the 2nd and/or the 3rd respondents to

enter into the Agreement marked P4.

Learned counsel for the respondents in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2

of the written submissions informs Court that in the facts and

circumstances of this case, as they stand now, the respondents

have no objection this Court making a suitable order.

According to P3, the Agreement P4 could be signed subject to

fulfilling three requirements by the petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner drawing

attention of this Court to the proceedings dated 27.07.2016

states that the petitioner has now fulfilled those three

requirements.

However, even during the argument, the learned counsel for the

respondents was not certain whether in fact those three

prerequisites have been satisfied.

3

Hence the aforesaid writ of mandamus is issued subject to

fulfilling those three requirements, if they have not been fulfilled

up to now.

Learned counsel for the respondent further informs Court that

there is a practical difficulty in proceeding with this

tender/contract as the Bribery Commission has taken over

investigation into this matter and the file is now with the Bribery

Commission. As the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner submits the proceedings before the Bribery

Commission can continue according to law notwithstanding the

order given by Court in these proceedings.

Mandamus is issued subject to qualification. No costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
