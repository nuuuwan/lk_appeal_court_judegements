Janak De Silva J.

A preliminary objection was raised by the Defendant-Respondent (Defendant) when this matter was

taken up for argument. It was submitted that the notice of appeal and petition of appeal is not

signed by the Attorney-at-Law on record for the Plaintiff-Appellant (Plaintiff). Hence the

argument was made that the appeal was bad in law and should be dismissed.

The determination of this objection requires an examination of the procedural rules governing

the filing and revocation of proxy. In this context it is important to bear in the mind the following

pronouncement of A.R.B. Amerasinghe J. in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and others: 1

"There is the substantive law and there is the procedural law. Procedural law is not

secondary: The maxim ubi ius ibi remedium reflects the complementary character of civil

procedure law. The two branches are also interdependent. It is by procedure that the law

is put into motion, and it is procedural law which puts life into substantive law, gives it

remedy and effectiveness and brings it into action."2

Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) permits a party to an action to make or do certain

appearances, applications or acts in any court in person, by his recognized agent or by a

registered attorney duly appointed by that party. Section 5 of the CPC defines a "registered

attorney" to mean an attorney-at-law appointed under Chapter V by a party or his recognized

agent to act on his behalf.

Section 27(1) of the CPC requires the appointment of a registered attorney to be made in writing

signed by the client. There is no dispute between the parties that Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza

Attorney-at-Law was appointed by the Plaintiff to be his registered attorney. Journal entry dated

04.06.1992 indicates that the plaint was filed along with the proxy of Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza

Attorney-at-Law.

The Plaintiff submitted that court had on this day granted leave to revoke the proxy of Mr. W.H.

Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law and that he had been discharged from his duties as the

registered attorney of the Plaintiff. This necessitates an examination of the procedure to be

followed in the revocation of a proxy.

Section 27{2} of the CPC states that once a proxy is filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the

leave of the court and after notice to the registered attorney by a writing signed by the client and

filed in court. In Tillekeratne v. Wijesinghe3 Hutchinson c.J. held that section 27 of the CPC is

directory and this view is supported in Kadirgamadas v. Suppiah4 and Lorna Maritime Corporation

v. Mohammed Saleh Bawazir and Others.s However, Hutchinson c.J. was referring to the

procedure to be followed in the appointment of a proctor and not the revocation of a proxy.

J.A.N. De Silva c.J. in S.P. Gunatilleke v. S.P. Sunil Ekanayake6was concerned whether the wording

of section 27 of the epe permitted such a liberal construction.?

Section 27 of the epe clearly specifies the manner in which a proxy should be filed and revoked.

It is the duty of the court to follow the provisions in section 27(2) of the epe when revoking a

proxy. Unless and until that procedure is adhered to by court, no proxy could be revoked. Till

then the proxy filed earlier will be in force. 8

It is true that a party dissatisfied with his registered attorney is at liberty to revoke the proxy and

appoint another Attorney-at-Law as his registered attorney. But in revoking the proxy, a party

has to follow the procedure prescribed in section 27(2) of the epc. Revocation must be made

with the leave of court and after notice to the registered attorney.9 A.R.B. Amerasinghe J. in

Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and others10stated as follows:

liThe protective character of the laws of civil procedure, among other things, requires

orderliness so that there might be clarity and certainty and no confusion. If a party is

dissatisfied with his registered attorney, he is at liberty to revoke the proxy filed in court

and either appoint some other attorney or act for himself. If the registered attorney dies,

or is removed or suspended or otherwise becomes incapable, he may either appoint some

other attorney or act for himself. However, that must be done in the manner prescribed

by sections 27 and 28 of the Civil Procedure Code, for justice, in my view, requires that

the work of a court must be conformable to laws, including civil procedure laws/'ll

Several aspects of the litigation are sought to be protected by the procedure set out in section

27(2) of the cpc. Once a client appoints a registered attorney to act on his behalf, he must be

able to take comfort in the fact that the registered attorney will continue to act for him and look

after his interests until he is informed otherwise. In Daniel v. Chandradeva12 the Supreme Court

emphasized the importance of the instructing attorney revoking the proxy only after warning the

client and giving him a reasonable time to appoint another registered attorney. In fact, prior to

Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No.8 of 2017, the registered attorney could not initiate

an application for revocation of the proxy. It had to be done by the client. The court must have

clear notice of the registered attorney appointed to look after the interests of a party. The court

is also duty bound to ensure that leave to revoke a proxy is not granted unless the client is fully

aware of the proposed revocation. Whether an application for revocation of proxy should be

allowed or not is a matter for the discretion of court. 13 In view of the purposes of section 27(2)

of the CPC, I am of the view that the procedure set out therein is mandatory in nature.

The question then is whether the proxy of Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law was duly

revoked. In this case there is no application in writing signed by the Plaintiff and filed in court as

required by section 27(2) of the cpc. Court did not and could not have granted leave for the

revocation of the proxy on 27.10.1994 as firstly, there was no written application signed by the

Plaintiff as required by section 27(2) of the CPC and secondly, as court rejected the application

of the Defendant to dismiss the action as the registered attorney for the Plaintiff marked his

appearance. Clearly court considered Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law to be the

registered attorney of the Plaintiff when proceedings ended on 27.10.1994.

Trial began on the next date namely 16.2.1995 with the raising of issues. Journal entry of that

date shows that a new proxy was filed on behalf of the Plaintiff. The proceedings of that date

indicate that Mr. Sajeewa Gunaratne is the registered attorney-at-law for the Plaintiff. The

question is whether this amounts to an implied leave for the revocation of proxy as in

Wanigaratna v. Dissanayake14 Weerasuriya J. held that there can be implied leave for the

12 (1994) 2 SrLL.R. 1

13 Fernando v. Mathew (15 N.L.R. 88)

14 (2002)2 SrLL.R. 331

revocation of a proxy. is However in that case revocation papers were filed and the only question

was whether leave was granted by the court given that there was no express granting of leave.

But no revocation papers were filed at all in this case after 27.10.1994. All what has happened is

that a proxy of Mr. Sajeewa Gunaratne was filed as the registered attorney-at-law for the Plaintiff

while the proxy of Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff was still in force.

Courts appear to have strictly construed the requirements of section 27(2) of the Cpc. In National

Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Violet16 the Court of Appeal refused to recognize the revocation of

proxy of the original registered attorney although the revocation papers were filed before a fresh

proxy was filed as the application for revocation was not supported before court and permission

obtained for revocation.

The Plaintiff submitted that after 16.2.1995 the action proceeded on more than 15 trial dates

with the new proxy filed on record. It was submitted that all the steps taken thereafter was taken

by the new attorney on record and that even the counsel for the Plaintiff appeared on his

instructions and no objection was raised by the Defendant before the District Court. Objection to

the jurisdiction of a court must be raised at the earliest opportunity available. In Hatton National

Bank Ltd. v. M.S. Hebtulabhoy & Co. Limited and Othersi ? Suresh Chandra J. appears to take the

view that any objection to a defective proxy or absence of a proxy is a jurisdictional issue and

must be raised at the first opportunity. He was relying on the judgement of lA.N. De Silva c.J. in

S.P. Gunatilake v. S.P. Sunil Ekanayake. 18 However, in that case J.A.N. De Silva c.J. was of the view

that the total failure to file a proxy does not in any way effect the validity of the proceedings. I

am of the view that the same reasoning is applicable when there is a valid proxy on record and

another proxy is filed without duly revoking the original proxy. Therefore, any objection on that

ground need not have been raised before the District Court as that defect did not affect the

jurisdiction of the District Court.

One may contend that even though there are two proxies on record, court should accept and act

on the second proxy as the intention of the litigant to retain the services of a new registered

attorney is clear. The same point can be raised in a situation where the litigant acts on his behalf

while there is a registered attorney appointed by him to look after his interests. However, courts

have consistently held that as long as a proxy is valid a litigant must act through his registered

attorney and that he cannot perform any act in court relating to the proceedings.19

Section 755 of the CPC sets out the manner in which a notice of appeal and petition of appeal

must be filed. Where there is a registered attorney on record every notice of appeal and petition

of appeal must be signed by that registered attorney. The failure to do so is fatal. 20

For the reasons set out above, the registered attorney for the Plaintiff on the days that the notice

of appeal and petition of appeal were filed was Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law. The

notice of appeal and petition of appeal is not signed by him. Instead it is signed by Mr. Sajeewa

Gunaratne whose proxy was filed as the registered attorney-at-law for the Plaintiff while the

proxy of Mr. W.H. Bernard De Soyza Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff was still in force. It is trite

law that court cannot recognize two registered attorneys appearing for the same party in the

same cause. 21Therefore, I am of the view that the notice of appeal and petition of appeal filed in

this appeal is not valid in law.

The Plaintiff has submitted that if there is any defect, it is one that is curable in terms of section

759(2) of the Cpc. He relied on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Dayarathne and another

v. Wijerathna and others. 22 However, in that case the Supreme Court was of the view that a notice

of appeal addressed to the original court can be cured by resorting to section 759(2) of the CPC

even if there was a defect. It did not deal with a situation where there were two proxies on

record. In Jayasekera v. Lakmini and others23 the Supreme Court was confronted with a situation

where one of the parties to the original action was not made a party to the appeal and Ekanayake

19 Fernando v. Sybil Fernando [(1997) 3 SrLL.R. ll, linadasa and another v. Sam Silva and others [(1994) 1 SrLL.R. 232], Seelawathie and another v layasinghe [(1985) 2 Sri.L.R. 266], Hameed v. Deen and others [(1988) 2 SrLL.R. 1]

J. granted relief in terms of section 759(2) of the CPC taking the view that the power of the court

to grant relief under section 759 (2) is wide and discretionary and is subject to such terms as the

court may deem just. This case again did not deal with a situation where there were two proxies

on record. I am of the view that section 759(2) of the CPC cannot be resorted to when a second

proxy has been filed while the original proxy is still valid. A similar view was taken Chithrasiri J.

Ran-Naide v. Wimafasooriya. 24

The Plaintiff further submitted that the preliminary objection raised by the Defendant is of a

technical nature and that courts should dispense with such mere technical objections. He relied

on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Elias v. Cader and another25 wherein it was stated that

for the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections should be discouraged and

parties should be encouraged to seek justice by dealing with the merits of the case.

The Importance of procedural law was alluded to by A.R.B. Amerasinghe J. in Fernando v. Sybil

Fernando and others26in the following pronouncement:

tiThe concept of the laws of civil procedure being a mere vehicle in which parties should

be safely conveyed on the road to justice is misleading, for it leads to the incorrect notion

that the laws of civil procedure are of relatively minor importance, and may, therefore be

disobeyed or disregarded with impunity. The expression of a concern that the laws of civil

procedure must not be a juggernaut car that throws its passengers out to be run over by

it, I suppose, was figuratively meant to say that with greater force. However, with great

respect, all that the dictum does is to obscure the role of the laws of civil procedure: The

English word "juggernaut" is derived from the Hindi word "Jagganath" and the Sanskrit

word "Jaganatha" meaning the lord or protector of the world. It was a title of Krishna, the

eighth avatar of Vishnu. There had been for a long time, especially at Puri in Orissa, an

annual pageant in which an image of this deity was dragged in procession on an enormous

car under which devotees threw themselves to be crushed.

Judges, do not blindly devote themselves to procedures or ruthlessly sacrifice litigants to

technicalities, although parties on the road to justice may choose to act recklessly. On the

contrary, as the indispensable vehicle for the attainment of justice, civil procedural law

has a protective character. In its protective character, civil procedural law represents the

orderly, regular and public functioning of the legal machinery and the operation of the

due process of law."27

I am unable to agree that the objection raised by the Defendant is merely technical in nature.

The apPointment of a registered attorney is an important step in the dispensation of justice.

Important consequences flow from such an appointment. It allows the courts to act on the basis

that the registered attorney has been duly authorized to act on behalf of the litigant. The litigant

is bound by the actions of his registered attorney. For instance, section 58 of the Evidence

Ordinance states that no fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their

agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to admit by any

writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed

to have admitted by their pleadings.

For the reasons set out above, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Defendant and

dismiss the appeal. I make no order as to costs.
