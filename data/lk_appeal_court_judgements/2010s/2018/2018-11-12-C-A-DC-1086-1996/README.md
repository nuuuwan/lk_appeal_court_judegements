Counsel Dinesh De Alwis AAL for the 1st Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner.

S.A.D.S. Suraweera AAL for the Substituted - Plaintiff-Respondent.

Decided On 2018.11.09.

The pt Defendant- Appellant- Petitioner, by his Petition dated 11.09.2012 has

prayed this Court to allow deeds marked as (Xl' and (X2' with the said Petition to

be admitted and accepted as evidence in this case and in this appeal. In other

words, this is an application to lead fresh evidence in appeal. The Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent by his statement of objections dated 11.01.2016 has

prayed that the aforesaid application of the 1st Defendant-Appellant- Petitioner be

rejected and dismissed.

It was held in W.A. Ratwatte Vs A. Bandara 70 NLR 231 that the reception of fresh

evidence in a case at the stage of appeal, may be justified if three conditions are

fulfilled, namely;

1. It must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with

reasonable diligence for use at the trial,

2. The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an

important influence on the result of the case, although it need not to be

decisive,

3. The evidence must be such as is presumably, to be believed or in other words

it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.

The pt Defendant- Appellant- Petitioner does not state why he could not submit

these two deeds, marked as Xl, and X2 with the Petition, at the trial. The additional

Registrar of the Land Registry, Negombo has certified the copies of these two deeds

as true copies on 2010.07.20 and 2010.08.05 respectively when they were issued

from the land registry. This shows that these deeds were available in the land

registry and if the pt Defendant-Appellant was diligent and had a real need to

produce them during the trial, he could have done so by taking copies from the

land registry.

On the other hand, the aforesaid certification by the Additional Land Registrar

indicates that the 1st Defendant - Appellant took these certified copies only after a

lapse of 3 years from the date of the Petition of Appeal. This application was made

only in 2012. Had this court taken up this appeal for argument on the first date it

was fixed for argument, namely 23.02.2011, this appeal would have been disposed

of without this application being tendered. However, as said before the pt

Defendant - Appellant - Petitioner has not given any acceptable reason why he

could not produce these deeds in the District court when they were available in the

Land Registry.

Hence, as per the aforesaid decision in Ratwatte Vs Bandara this application has to

be rejected.

On the other hand, the land sought to be partitioned in the District Court was a

land named Lot B of Meegahawatta of 39.19 perches in extent which was depicted

in Plan No. 170 dated 12.09.1925 made by C.R. Felsinger, Licensed Surveyor. The

identity of the corpus was not challenged by the pt Defendant- Appellant-

Petitioner and, in fact, there was an admission recorded at the beginning of the

trial stating that the said corpus is depicted in the preliminary Plan No. 4882 dated

25.02.1986 made by K.A.G. Samarasighe, Licensed surveyor. Even in his statement

of claims, the corpus was admitted. The two deeds marked as Xl and X2 with the

application were executed in 1944 and 1942 respectively and they were executed

in respect of an undivided portion of a land named Meegahwatta of about 1 acre

in extent. When the pt Defendant- Appellant- Petitioner admits the existence of a

land of 39 perches according to a Plan made in 1925, he cannot be allowed to

present a case to show that in 1942 or 1944, it was an undivided land of about 1

acre. Furthermore, this Court observes that the pt Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner

had been a party to two deeds marked at the trial as P7 and 1 V7, either as a vendee

or vendor, which describes the land in accordance with the schedule to the Plaint,

namely Lot B of Meegahwatta depicted in Plan No. 170 dated 12.12.1925 made by

C.R. Felsinger, Licensed Surveyor. Thus, the corpus, admitted and partitioned in

the District Court case is a land of 39 Perches in extent which has a separate identity

from 1925 as per the Plan made by C.R. Felsinger, Licensed Surveyor. Perhaps the

1-acre land referred to in Xl and X2 relates to the main, larger land that existed

before the survey done in 1925 to make the said plain of C.R. Felsinger, Licensed

Surveyor. Therefore, it is possible they might have been executed to convey the

balance part of the larger land that existed prior to 1925.

The pt Defendant- Appellant in his original statement of claim and the 1st amended

statement of claim had admitted the devolution of title shown in the plaint.

Therefore, the production of some deeds that relate to Meegahwatta of about 1

I

acre through the 1st Defendant- Appellant- Petitioner during the trial is not

sufficient, which deeds were rejected by the learned District Judge in his Judgment,

to prove that reference to an undivided portion of the aforesaid 1-acre land is to a

portion of the corpus of the action. If the 1st Defendant Appellant Petitioner knew

it, he could not have accepted the devolution of title in the plaint in his original

statement of claim and the 1st amended statement of claim.

The application is limited to consider these two deeds as fresh evidence and

nothing else. The mere production of these two deeds will not be sufficient, to

prove that they relate to the undisputed, admitted corpus of 39 perches that was

in existence from 1925.

Therefore, the application is dismissed with costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree,
