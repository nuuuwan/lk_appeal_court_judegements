P.PADMAN SURASENA, l. (PICA)

Petitioner is a teacher serving in a government school. According

to the averments in the petition, petitioner is married with 3 children.

In this application the Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, a mandate

in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in

the document produced marked P 36 to suspend the payment of

petitioner's monthly salary.

3

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that

the 1st respondent has stopped paying her salary because she had failed

to tender a copy of her appOintment letter to the authorities.

It is the position of the Petitioner that this copy of her

appOintment letter was in deed handed over to the authorities as per

a request made to that effect by the relevant authority at a previous

occasion. Petitioner relies on the document produced by the

Respondents marked 4 R 8 to substantiate that position.

The Respondents in turn have produced a copy of the

appOintment letter which is in their possession marked 4 R 6.

The concern of the Respondents according to the submissions

made by the learned state counsel is to ascertain whether the

Petitioner is the correct person who has been appOinted as a teacher.

4

Respondents do not controvert following facts:-

(1) that the relevant appointment has been made in the year

1994.

(2) that the Petitioner has been serving in Government

Schools since that time.

(3) that the Government had been paying the Petitioner's

salary up to the time it was stopped by the document

marked P 36.

( 4 ) that there is no evidence what so ever for the

Respondents to claim that the Petitioner is not the person

who has been appOinted as a teacher by the Government.

5

(5) that it is the responsibility of the authorities to maintain

the personal files of its employees which should have a

copy of the appointment letter.

This court having considered the submissions of the learned State

Counsel, was not able to gather any legal basis to justify the suspension

of the payment of the Petitioner's salary. Admittedly, the petitioner is

still serving the Government in the capacity of a teacher without a salary

even at this moment. Further, the basis of suspension of salary (Le.

the non-tendering of the appointment letter by the Petitioner) is unlikely

to be changed in the future as well, since the Petitioner has taken up

the position that it has already been handed over to the respondents.

In these circumstances, this court decides to grant the relief

prayed in prayer (c) of the petition and issue a writ of certiorari to quash

the decision reflected in the letter produced marked P 36 to temporary

stop the payment of the Petitioner's salary.

.. 6

This court also decides to issue a writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st to 11th Respondents to pay the Petitioner the arrears of

her salary with effect from the month of June in the year 2016.

Application is allowed.
