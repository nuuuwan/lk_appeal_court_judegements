S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J

The original Plaintiff instituted the present action in the District Court of Galle

by Plaint dated 05.05.1976 against 32 Defendants to partition a land called

'Kowda Kumbura' depicted in Plan bearing No. 1179 dated 30.07.1976 made

by F. Guruge, Licensed Surveyor marked as 'X'. This preliminary survey was

carried out by the Court Commissioner who depicted the corpus as 7 lots.

After the said preliminary survey more parties were added and due to the death

of several Defendants and the action continued against the present 44

Defendants.

Out of the 44 Defendants the 3rd and 44th Defendant filed a joint statement of

claim and the 28th - 32nd Defendants also filed a joint statement of claim.

Trial commenced and the parties present admitted the corpus as depicted in the

preliminary survey by Plan bearing No. 1179 dated 30.07.l976 made by F.

Guruge, Licensed Surveyor. The original Plaintiff raised issue Nos. 1 - 4, the 3rd

and 44th Defendants raised issue Nos. 5 - 10 and the 23 rd - 32nd Defendants

raised issue Nos. 11 - 13.

Thereafter, the original Plaintiff died and his daughter the substituted Plaintiff -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) was substituted in his room.

The Plaintiff commenced her case and marked documents PI - P 18. In the

course of the evidence in chief of the Plaintiff the 3rd and 44th Defendants who

raised issue Nos. 5 - 10 settled their dispute between the parties. The same was

not objected to by the 23 rd - 32nd Defendants (vide 210 of the appeal brief).

Therefore, the contest was only between the Plaintiff and the 23 rd -32nd

Defendants and the issues subject to the present action which needed to be

answered were issue Nos. 1 - 4 and 11 - 13.

After the conclusion of the Plaintiffs case the 44th Defendant and the 30th

Defendant gave evidence on behalf of the 23 rd - 32nd Defendants and after the

conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge delivered judgement dated

21.10.1992.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the 28th - 32nd Defendant - Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) preferred the instant Appeal on the

ground inter alia that the learned Trial Judge has failed to investigate title as per

Section 25 of the Partition Act.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Act reads;

"On the date fixed for the trial of a partition action or on any other date to

which the trial may be postponed or adjourned, the court shall examine

the title of each party and shall hear and receive evidence in support

thereof and shall try and determine all questions of law and fact arising in

that action in regard to the right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or

in the land to which the action relates, and shall consider and decide

which of the orders mentioned in section 26 should be made."

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submits the case of Thilagaratnam

Vs. Athpunathan and others 1996 (2) SLR 66 in which it was held inter alia;

"( 1) Although there is a duty cast on court to investigate title in a

Partition action, the court can do so only within the limits of pleadings,

-' admissions, points of contest, evidence both documentary and oral."

Per Anandacoomaraswamy, 1.

"Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding

the shares in the corpus for them; otherwise parties wiII tender their

pleadings and expect the court to do their work and their Attomeys-

at IJ Law's work for them to get title to those shares in the corpus."

As submitted by the learned Counsel for the mam point of contention as

, crystallised by the learned District Judge is as follows;

"Did Eramanis die leaving as his heirs his wife namely Dewa Egohamy

and 5 children namely Appu Singho who died unmarried and issueless,

Subarashamy, Jamisappu, Babohamy and Sarohamy as claimed by the

23rd - 32nd Defendants or did Eramanis's rights devolve on his heirs as

pleaded in paragraph 18 -33 of the Plaint according to which he

transferred 4/20 share to Urala Bastian and the balance share on his

children namely Endi, Umanis and Bastian?

In proof of their claim the 23 rd - 32n(1 Defendants produced documents 23 01

23 05. The Counsel for the Appellants contends that the learned District Judge

has erred when he rejected the said documents and accepted Deed marked as

P18.

Upon a perusal of the judgment it is clear that the learned District Judge has

meticulously analysed the Deeds placed before Court and has come to the

con'ect conclusion that Appu Singho, Subarashamy, Jamisappu, Babohamy and

Sarohamy were the children of Bastian who was the son of Eramanis. It is also

clear that the tittle claimed by the Plaintiff stems from very old title deeds.

This Court agrees with the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff that 'Court cannot

go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the corpus

for them.'

The Appellants had ample opportunity to substantiate their claim either with

oral evidence in support of their claim or by documentary evidence such as birth

. certificates, marriage certificates or death certificates but it is evident that they

have failed to do so.

Furthern1Ore, it seems that the written submissions of the learned Counsel for

the Appellants are merely a reproduction of the contents averred in the Petition

of Appeal.

In the circumstances as discussed above we see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned District Judge. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal with

costs set at Rs. 10,0001-.

Appeal Dismissed.
