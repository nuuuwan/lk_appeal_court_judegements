Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus

compelling the 1st respondent-Commissioner General of Motor

Traffic to submit the original of the Statement of Change of

Possession of a Motor Vehicle (Form MTA 6) marked P2 to the

Magistrate's Court of Kuliyapitiya in case No. BR/1422/2012, and

a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st respondent to

register the vehicle relevant to that document, i.e. vehicle No. UP

KE 6563, in the name of the 3rd respondent on P2.

The petitioner was the registered owner the said vehicle. His

complaint is that his former wife who is the 2nd respondent has

transferred the said vehicle to the 3rd respondent forging his

signature on P2. Upon his complaint the police have initiated

criminal proceedings before the Magistrate's Court against the

former wife, and the Magistrate's Court has directed the 1st

respondent to produce the original of P2.

The 1st respondent by way of several written communications has

explained to the Magistrate's Court his inability to produce the

original immediately, the main reason being due to lack of storage

facilities the difficulty in tracing this document among around

eight million of such files, and such files being spread over at

various locations, which are now being shifted to the new building

at Werahara.

With the objections the 1st respondent has also filed photographs

for this Court to better understand the ground situation regarding

storage facilities of these files.

Nonetheless, it is not the position of the 1st respondent that he

cannot produce the document, but he cannot produce it

immediately due to the prevailing situation.

I am convinced with what the 1st respondent says in that regard.

In any event, this Court cannot quash the transfer by way of

certiorari when investigations are underway and the matter is still

pending in the Magistrate's Court.

On the other hand, mandamus will not be issued if the act is

practically impossible to perform or the compliance of which will

entail grave public and administrative inconvenience by reason of

the circumstances. (Mowjood v. Pussadeniya1, Credit Information

Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd2,

Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education3)

Prerogative writs will not be issued as a matter of routine, as a

matter of course or as a matter of right. It is purely a discretionary

remedy to be granted or denied in the unique facts and

circumstances of each individual case. Even if the party applying

the writ is entitled to that relief, still it can be denied if the other

factors stand against granting of that relief. (Jayaweera v.

Assistent Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura4, Siddeek v.

Jacolyn Seneviratne5, Edirisooriya v. National Salaries and Carde

Commission6, Selvamani v. Dr. Kumaravelupillai7)

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
