Argued on: 15/1112017

Decided on: 14/12/2017

L.T.B. Dehideniya J (PICA)

The Petitioner was an employee of the Food and Agriculture

Organization (F AO) of the United Nations in Sri Lanka. His services were

terminated and the Petitioner had instituted an action in Labour Tribunal

where he was awarded compensation. The 1 st and 2nd Respondents have

refused to enforce the award of the Labour Tribunal. The Petitioner is

seeking a mandate against the 1 st and 2nd Respondents to enforce the said

award.

The 1 st Respondent has refused to enforce this order as per the

document marked P7 on the basis of the Diplomatic Immunity granted to the

FAO. The Petitioner's contention is that the FAO has no Judicial Immunity

in relation to the contracts of employment entered into with the Sri Lankans.

As per the Note Verbal marked X3 issued by the Ministry of Extemal

Affairs indicate that the matters arising out of termination of contracts of

employment do not fall into the Judicial Immunity.

Under these circumstances I issue notice on Respondents.

President of the Court of Appeal

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
