Senior State Counsel appearing for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 9th Respondents

informed this Court that written submissions have already been tendered by

the parties and moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the said

written submissions.

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the directions and/or advise and/or the

endorsements contained in 'PS,1;

(b) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st -4th Respondents to assess the

Customs Duty as per the amount declared in the Customs Declaration

ma rked 'P4'.

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioners state that they are carrying on business in partnership under

the name, style and firm of 'Moghul Holdings'. The Petitioners state that in the

ordinary course of business, they entered into a sales contract with M/s

Seaboard Industry and Trading Limited on or about 1ih July 2011 to purchase

a consignment of Twist Drills, at a total cost of USD 76662. A copy of the said

sales contract had been produced with the petition marked 'P2'.

Upon the arrival of the goods in Sri Lanka, the Petitioners had submitted a

Customs Declaration, annexed to the petition marked 'P4', in which the value

of the goods was declared as USD 7679.78. The Petitioners state that they have

paid a sum of Rs. 229,113 being the customs duties, levies and other charges

due on the said goods, calculated on the value given in the sales contract and

declared to Customs in the Customs Declaration 'P4'. The Petitioners state that

inspite of customs duties and other levies having been paid on the correct

value, Sri Lanka Customs had directed that the goods should not be released

until the value was finalised. The Petitioners have annexed to the petition, a

1 'PS' is a document submitted by the 2nd Petitioner to Sri Lanka Customs. Several officers of Sri Lanka Customs have made endorsements on the reverse thereof, with regard to ascertaining the correct value of the goods.

2 The price of USD 7666 includes the cost of the goods and the cost of freight to Colombo.

document marked 'PS' on which several officers of Sri Lanka Customs have

made endorsements with regard to ascertaining the correct value of the

goods. This is the document that the Petitioners are seeking to quash by a Writ

of Certiorari.

Being dissatisfied with the ruling of Sri Lanka Customs not to release the goods

until the value was finalised, by a letter dated 9th November 2011 annexed to

the petition marked 'P6', the Petitioners had requested that the transaction

value declared by the Petitioners be accepted, for the reasons set out therein.

The Petitioners had further requested Sri Lanka Customs to inform them how

the customs value had been determined if the transaction value given by the

Petitioners cannot be accepted. The Petitioners had also requested that the

goods be released in the meantime, on a bank guarantee.

There is an endorsement made by an officer of Sri Lanka Customs on 'P6' on

the same date3, which reads as follows:

"Please see the explanation given by the importer. Consider that and see

whether value determined by Valuation Division is correct. If it is

necessary to take considerable time please release consignment on a

bank guarantee."

The goods had accordingly been released on a bank guarantee dated 1 t h

November 2011, issued by the 5th Respondent.4 The said guarantee was valid

until 15th February 2012. Sri Lanka Customs had demanded payment under the

said Guarantee prior to its expiry but this demand had subsequently been

3 9th November 2011. This endorsement has been made on the front page of 'P6'.

4 The said Bank Guarantee has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P7'.

5

recalled after the Petitioners took steps to extend the guarantee until 15th

August 2012. This Court observes that neither party has submitted any

material to this Court with regard to the present status of the said guarantee.

The complaint of the Petitioners to this Court is that the officers of Sri Lanka

Customs did not have the authority to give directions and/or make

endorsements on 'PS' with regard ::0 the value declared by the Petitioners. In

the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Petitioners, it has been

urged that the customs duty must be assessed as per the value declared in the

Customs Declaration and that officers of Sri Lanka Customs had no jurisdiction

and/or power and/or authority to adjust the value declared in the Customs

Declaration.

This Court must observe at the outset that the Petitioners are not seeking to

quash any decision of the Respondents. They are only seeking to quash

'directions, advise or endorsements' on (PS'. This Court has examined the

several endorsements made on the reverse of (PS' and observes that none of

the endorsements contain any decision. They are merely internal entries,

discussing the steps that need to be taken to determine the value of the goods.

The Respondents have taken up the position in their Statement of Objections

that the value indicated by the Petitioners was not realistic and that additional

documentation was called from the Petitioners to substantiate the value. The

Respondents have stated further that the decision of the Additional Director

General of Customs in respect of the value of the goods is pending. This is

borne out by the final two endorsements made on the reverse of (P6' on 15th

and 16th November 2011 respectively, which reads as follows:

6

liThe values given by the appraiser for the commodity was based on the

database value. Therefore, only relief I could recommend is to release the

consignment on a bank guarantees."

"A bank guarantee is acceptable for liability and 10% of that amount.

Copy documents to be sent to the Valuation Department for verification

and report back.,,6

The Respondents have stated in their written submissions that the Petitioners

have failed to provide material to substantiate the declared value of the goods,

although requested and that this application has been filed prior to any final

decision being reached by Sri Lanka Customs with regard to the value of the

goods. To this extent, this application is premature.

It is trite law that for a Writ of Certiorari to issue, there must be a decision. The

Petitioners have not annexed a decision and the Respondents state there is no

final decision. That a final decision has not been taken is apparent when one

considers the aforementioned endorsements made on 'p6'. Thus, this Court is

of the view that in the absence of a decision, a Writ of Certiorari does not lie.

The Petitioners are also seeking a Writ of Mandamus compelling the

Respondents to assess customs duty on the value declared by the Petitioners

in their Customs Declaration marked 'p4'.

5 It is only thereafter that the Petitioners have submitted the Bank Guarantee 'P7' on 1ih November, 201l.

6 A similar endorsement has been made on the left side of the reverse of 'PG'.

Several provisions of the Customs Ordinance require an importer to declare

the value of the goods and sets out the consequences of not doing so. In terms

of Section 47 of the Customs Ordinance, every consignee is required to tender

a Bill of Entry, commonly referred to as the Customs Declaration or 'Cus Dec'

setting out the details that are required in the said declaration including the

value of the goods that are the subject matter of the said Bill of Entry.

Section 51 of the Customs Ordinance reads as follows:

"In all cases when the duties imposed upon the importation of articles are

charged according to the value thereof, the respective value of each such

article shall be stated in the entry together with the description and

quantity of the same, and duly affirmed by a declaration made by the

importer or his agent on a form7 ... as may be specified by the Director

General ...... and such value shall be determined in accordance with the

provisions of Schedule E, and duties shall be paid on a value so

determined."

A truthful declaration of the price actually paid or payable for a good is

paramount for the Customs to determine the value of the good and thereby,

for a proper working of the Customs Ordinance. It is for this reason that Sri

Lanka Customs has the power to investigate any instance of suspected

undervaluation, either before or after the goods have been cleared by Sri

Lanka Customs.

7 This form is known as the 'Value Declaration Form.'

Section 51A(1)(a) of the Customs Ordinance provides as follows:

"Whenever an officer of customs has reason to doubt the truth or

accuracy of any particulars contained in a bill of entry or a declaration

made under section 51 or the documents presented to him in support of a

bill of entry under section 47, the officer of customs may require the

importer or his agent or any other party connected with the importation

of goods, to furnish such other information, including documentary or

other evidence in proof of the fact that the declared customs value

represents the total amount actually paid or is payable for the imported

goods as adjusted in accordance with Article 8 of Schedule E."

Thus, it is clear to this Court that Sri Lanka Customs has the power to require

the importer to provide proof of the fact that the declared customs value

represents the total amount actually paid, when it has reason to doubt the

truth or accuracy of the particulars contained in the Customs Declaration.

This Court has examined the Customs Declaration 'P4' and observes that an

endorsement has been made on the reverse thereof, requiring that a sample

be sent for valuation, as it appears that Sri Lanka Customs had reason to doubt

the truth or accuracy of the value declared by the Petitioners. The document

marked 'PS', which has been initiated on 24th October 2011, contains several

endorsements made by officers of Sri Lanka Customs, with the first

endorsement being made on the same date. It appears that no steps were

taken by Sri Lanka Customs until the Petitioners sent the letter 'P6' on 9th

November 2011. Pursuant to the endorsement made on the front page of 'P6,8

on 9th November 2011, it appears that the relevant documents were called

from the Petitioners and have been received by Sri Lanka Customs.

Section 51A(l){b) which sets out the procedure that should be followed after

Sri Lanka Customs has called for further documents, reads as follows:

"After the receipt of further information or in the absence of any

response, if the officer of Customs still has reasonable doubt as to the

truth or accuracy of the declared customs value, it shall be deemed that

the customs value of the imported goods in question cannot be

determined under the provisions of Article 1 of Schedule E and the

importer, if so requests, shall be informed by the officer in writing of the

grounds for such doubt and be afforded an opportunity to he heard."

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioners, it has been argued

that in terms of Article 1 of Schedule E of the Customs Ordinance, customs

duty of any imported goods shall be the transaction value, that is the price

actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to Sri Lanka. The

Petitioners position therefore is that as they have correctly declared the

transaction value, the Petitioners are only liable to pay customs duty on the

said transaction value. This position is not correct for the reason that in terms

of Section 51A(l){b), if the Officers of Sri Lanka Customs have a doubt on the

accuracy of the declared customs value or in other words the transaction

value, even after the importer has submitted the necessary documents

requested by Sri Lanka Customs, then, the provisions of Article 1 of Schedule E

are displaced. Thus, the argument of the Petitioners is misconceived in law.

It has been consistently held by our Courts9 that a petitioner seeking a Writ of

Mandamus must show that there resides in him a legal right to the

performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is

sought. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by the

Superior Court for the performance of a public duty. Where officials have a

public duty to perform and have refused to perform, mandamus will lie to

secure the performance of the public duty, in the performance of which the

petitioner has sufficient legal interest.

This Court is of the view that the Petitioners cannot claim a legal right to have

the goods imported by them assessed for customs duty and other levies based

on the transaction value as the Customs Ordinance empowers Sri Lanka

Customs to amend this value in accordance with the provisions of the Customs

Ordinance. This Court is also of the view that in terms of Section 51A(1) of the

Customs Ordinance, officers of Sri Lanka Customs are under no public duty to

accept the transaction value as the customs value if they have a reason to

doubt the truth or accuracy of the value declared by the Petitioner. Hence, it is

clear that a Writ of Mandamus does not lie in the circumstances of this case.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, this Court does not see a legal basis to

issue the Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus prayed for. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.
