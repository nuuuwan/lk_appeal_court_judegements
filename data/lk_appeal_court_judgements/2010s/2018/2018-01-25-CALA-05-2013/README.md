*********** Judgment

S. Thurairaja PC J

Father of the deceased being aggrieved with the decision of the High Court of Ampara,

of accepting a plea and giving a suspended sentence, preferred an appeal to the Court

of Appeal.

Honourable Attorney General had forwarded an indictment against the pt and 2nd

accused respondents for committing the murder of Madura Nirakshana Warnakula.

When the matter was taken up before the Judge of the High Court of Ampara, counsels

made submissions and the learned State Counsel had reduced the charge of murder

to culpable homicide not amounting murder on the basis of a sudden fight, punishable

under section 297 of the Penal Code. Both accused respondents pleaded guilty made

submissions in mitigations. The learned trial Judge imposed 2 years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/- in default 12 months simple imprisonment. In

addition to the above the judge had ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 50,000/- to

the father of the deceased, and in default, sentence of 2 years imprisonment ordered.

The learned trial Judge having considered the facts ordered to suspend the sentence

imposed on the accused persons for a period of 10 years.

CAOS/20n JUDGMENT Page 2 of10

The Court, granted leave to the appellant and proceeded the matter for argument.

When the matter was taken up for argument the appellant had submitted following

grounds of appeal;

I. The learned trial judge has failed to appreciate the direct and circumstantial

evidence available against the accused-respondents warrants the

maintainability of a charge under section 296 of the Penal Code.

II. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Medico Legal Report

substantiate the charge under section 296 as there was no medical evidence

to support the version of the Accused -Respondents.

III. The learned trial judge has misdirected himself by failing to consider the

medical aspect of the case before come in to a wrongful conclusion that the

cause of death of the deceased was due to a fall.

IV. The learned trial judge erred in law by accepting a plea under a sudden fight

as there was evidence of murder.

V. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the evidence led at the Non-

summery inquiry in the event of accepting a plea on the basis of a sudden

fight.

VI. The submissions made by the both the defence and the State counsel in

mitigation are contrary to the fact of the case.

VII. The sentence imposed by the learned trial judge is unreasonable and

inadequate when consider the facts and the circumstances of the case.

All counsels made submissions and the counsel for the appellant and the State filed

written submissions. On perusing the submissions and the case record, the facts reveal

as follows; The deceased was about 30 years old, on the 23rd November 2011 at around

8 in the morning, had drinks with the first accused and another friend. When they

finished liquor bottles, they called the 2nd accused, who was three-wheeler driver to

bring arrack bottles. He went to Hingurana to bring the bottles, when he returned the

deceased quarrelled with him for the delay. Thereafter all of them consumed alcohol

for some time. There were some arguments and disputes among them at the time of

drinking. This shows that there was no animosity among these people, in fact it was a

friendly drinking session.

On many occasions the deceased who was high on liquor, started quarrelling with

others. They walked out of the house to the road, where all of them were little out of

their control. The deceased started shouting and quarrelling with others then the

second accused had slapped him on the face, then the deceased fell on the tarred road

backwards and went motionless. pt ,2nd accused and others attended to him and found

that the deceased had a bleeding injury on the back of the head, second accused

cleaned up the injury and made him to sleep at the deceased's home. The deceased

was taken to the hospital and admitted there. The deceased died on the 15th January

2012, and the post-mortem was held on the 17th instant. According to the Judicial

Medical Officer (JMO) "the cause of death was due to intracranial injuries (injuries to

brain and meningeal spaces)", further the JMO had made the following opinion in the

PMR, "There was multiple blunt force trauma over the head and limbs. Multiple Nature

of injuries compatible with injuries sustained by an assault."

It is clear that there is no pre-planned attack on the deceased by anyone including

the accused persons. None of the witnesses who made statements to the police and

gave evidence at the Non- summery inquiry, (Since there is no evidence led before the

high court, for the purpose of information and clarity, we made use of these materials.)

reveals of any motive for any attack. All of them were drinking and playing a game of

draught together. Considering, up to this point none of the prosecution witness

revealed of any premeditation nor motive of any attack. It can be easily concluded that

this is not a pre-planned murder.

CAOS/2013 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 10

Materials submitted by the prosecution at the Magistrate court and the high court

reveals that the 2nd accused slapped (one witness says kicked) the deceased and he

fell backwards on the tarred road. This is the only available evidence regarding an

assault. It is further revealed that the deceased had received an injury on the back of

his head, it was bleeding, he was hospitalised and treated for a period of 53 days in

the intensive care unit of the General Hospital of Ampara. Evidence reveal the fact that

the deceased had one injury on the head and became unconscious and there is no

instantaneous death. This shows us that the act done by the assailant couldn't have

anticipated result of death of his act. It is further fortifying the argument of the state

that the death had occurred after 53 days of the slap and fall and this reveals that the

injury caused was not fatal and did not bring death immediately.

It will become necessary to refer the relevant sections in the Penal Code.

Section 293;

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or

with the intention of causing such boddy injury as is likely to cause death, or

with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the

offence of culpable homicide.

Section 294 defines murder as states as follows,

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder-

Firstly- if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of

causing death; or

Secondly- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the

offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm

is caused,' or

Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person

and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to cause death, or

Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is

likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the

risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid

We peruse the PMR there the JMO had recorded 13 injuries on the body of the

deceased. Since the obseNation of the JMO caused severe confusion we reproduce

the list of injuries for easy reference;

Ante mortem injuries

7. Contusion 9 x 8 cm was situated over the left side of the head superimpose on

the left parietal bone. On reflecting the scalp revealed subgaleal hematoma 9

x 3.5 underneath this contusion.

above the injury no. 8.

72. Linear contusion 3.5 cm was situated over anterior aspect of left thigh 2 cm

below the injury 77.

73. Abrasion 3 x 2 cm was situated over the anterior aspect of left knee.

Surgical incisions,

Craniotomy over left side of the head, Tracheotomy and feeding Jejunostomy. (sic)

Anyone who goes through the PMR, especially the observation made under the Cause

of death column, will seriously suspect that the deceased died due to severe assault,

which caused the trauma on the head and limbs.

There is no doubt that these injuries were on the body of the deceased, but the

question is how are these injuries caused. Studying the PMR carefully we find that the

deceased was hospitalised for a long period and he was subjected to many types of

treatment and examinations. For an example the tram line contusion is a clear

indication of an assault with a cylindrical object. There is no evidence in this case, what

CA OS/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 10

tr,I

so ever to that effect, so these injuries were caused at the hospital, other observations

made in the PMR provide details, that the deceased was subject to tracheostomy and

there were evidence of intense intensive care in the form of tracheostomy, indwelling

catheter, 3-line central venous access over neck and intravenous canula over left arm.

We are unable to understand the views/ observation made in the last column of the

PMR by the JMO. He is also from the same health authority and he should have access

to all medical records of the deceased including the Bed Head Ticket (BHT) at the time

of the Post Mortem or before he prepared the report. We are also confused, as the

appellant, of the observation of the JMO. Especially the conclusion he came, regarding

the availability of evidence of assault. The only assault was, slapping before 53 days,

the maximum would be a contusion and it could not stand for that long. All injuries

other than the injury on the back of the head were caused during the treatment at the

hospital. JMO was the best person to identify, understand and provide explanation to

those injuries. Which is not available in the PMR.

Moving to the next issue that there is no question of the prerogative powers of the

Attorney General in accepting a plea. He is the best person to assess the evidence and

keep a balance between the Society and the accused especially between the victim

and the accused.

In this case, the available evidence does not reveal any sort of serious offensive attack

on the deceased. Witness Hewathantrige Nimal Priyantha Peries had come to the

house of the deceased at around Bam on 23/11/2011, he had seen the deceased and

his friends were consuming arrack (alcohol). After the bottle was finished the deceased

had told that it's not enough he wants more, then they have called the 2nd accused

who was a three-wheel driver and told him to go to Hingurana to bring Arrack.

CA OS/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 10

In the meantime, the deceased and others went to playa game of draught with

Gaminidasa. At around 11 am the 2nd accused brought the bottle, the deceased

quarrelled with for the delay in bringing the bottles. It was evidence that the 1st accused

heard saying that they had to hit the deceased to control because he was drunk and

uncontrollable. No one had observed any injuries at that time on the deceased. It

appears that most of them were drunk at that time. There were quarrels among them

but no big fights.

When they were playing game of draught the 2nd accused had told witness Chutti Aiya

to take the deceased away because he was becoming violent. Deceased walked up to

the tarred road and the 2nd accused were there with others had told him to go home,

when he refused the 2nd accused had slapped the deceased on the face, since the

deceased was drunk he lost his balance and fell backwards on the tarred road. He was

seen lying there, when others including both accused persons checked him he had a

bleeding on the back of the head, it was cleaned and he was taken to home.

Sarath Munaweera who was washing clothes at the pier had seen the 2nd accused

taking the deceased home. Available material reveals that many people around

including the accused persons were attempted to send the deceased to his house

because he was drunk and became unruly.

If we consider the charges against the 1st accused, there is no evidence that he was

involved in any attack on the deceased. Any how he presently pleaded guilty and there

is no appeal in that regard, we are not revisiting the conviction and the sentence.

Considering the appea" we find the father of the deceased had strengthened the

thoughts and argument to treat this incident as murder because of the observation of

the JMO in the PMR. We have extensively discussed about this earlier in this judgment

The learned SDSG submits that the available evidence will not bring home the

conviction for murder. Considering all available materials, we are in agreement of the

CA OS/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 10

decision of the Learned State Counsel and the learned Judge of the High Court. We

have no reason to interfere with the said decision.

Regarding the sentence, participation of the accused persons was different. There is

no evidence that the pt accused was involved in an assault. Considering the evidence

available, we have no reason to interfere with sentence imposed on him.

The 2nd accused was seen slapping the deceased once, considering his participation it

should be noted that he was not at the scene originally but invited by the deceased to

bring alcohol. There is no evidence of a voluntary or planned attack. He was seen

treating and caring the deceased after the slapping and falling incident.

Considering all factors including the above we are of the view that the sentence given

on the accused respondents are reasonable and we have no reasons to interfere with

the said decision. We do not find any merit in the grounds of appeal hence we dismiss

the appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence.
