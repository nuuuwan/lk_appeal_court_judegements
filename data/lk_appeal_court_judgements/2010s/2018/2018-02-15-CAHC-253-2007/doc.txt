Counsel for the Accused Appellant informs Court that they are only

contesting the sentence and not the conviction. We take into account that

it has taken 7 years for this brief to be translated to English by the

official translating branch of the Court of Appeal. Considering the

evidence and the time taken to translate this appeal, we decide to affirm

the conviction and the sentence. Sentences should run concurrently.

Subject to the above variation the conviction and sentence is affirmed and

the appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

L.U. JAYASURIYA, J.

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE COUR OF APPEAL.
