audited fmancial statements for the said year. The Petitioner has also

brought to notice of the Court that the Treasurer of the Federation has also

failed in submitting the audited financial statements of the previous years.

It is noted that the Petitioner's failure to submit the audited financial

statement for the year 2015 on time is in violation of the stipulated laws and

that such failure on the part of the Petitioner need to be considered when

considering the appeal in rejecting the nominations submitted by the
