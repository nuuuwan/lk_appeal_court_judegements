Decided on: 10.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners as residents of Elipichchawatte Road, Welivita,

Kaduwela have filed this application seeking a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st to 17th Respondents to perform their

duties by preventing the construction and the operation of the

unauthorized warehouse of the 18th Respondent at No.82/2,

Elipichchawatte Road, Welivita, Kaduwela.

At the commencement of the construction, as seen by several

documents marked with the petition such as X8A-X8C, X9A,

X9A(i)-(viii), X9B, the Petitioners have written letters one after

the other asking the Respondents to stop the unlawful

construction. That has not happened. Then they have filed this

application before this Court seeking the said relief and sought

unsuccessfully an interim order to stop further construction and

operation of the warehouse until the determination of this

application.

The construction of the warehouse is now complete and in

operation.

Then the next question is whether this Court shall, by way of

mandamus, direct the 1st to 17th Respondents to perform their

duties by preventing the operation of the warehouse.

6

According to the number of documents tendered before this

Court with the statements of objections, except the 15th and 16th

Respondentsthe Kaduwela Municipal Council, the other

Respondents have, in my view, to a great extent, discharged

their duties leaving the ultimate decision regarding construction

and operation of the warehouse to be taken by the Kaduwela

Municipal Council.

Even the 2nd-6th Respondentsthe Urban Development

Authority, in paragraph 6 of their (undated) limited statement of

objections filed in November 2016 has stated that the approval

of building permits has been delegated to the local authority

namely the Kaduwela Municipal Council by virtue of the powers

delegated to them. In paragraph 9(viii) also the Urban

Development Authority states that the building approval had

already been given and that is the purview of the Municipal

Council.

There is no dispute that Elipichchawatte is situated within the

Mixed Residential Zone and the Zoning Regulations marked X4

and X5 are applicable to Elipichchawatte. Those Regulations

have been made and Gazetted under section 8 of the Urban

Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978, as amended.

Clause 1 of those Regulations reads as follows: These

regulations are applicable for entire area within the

administrative limits of Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha Area during

the period of 2008-2020.

Clause 2.1 states that: Where the use of a site or premises is

designated for a specific use in the Kaduwela Development Plan it

should be used only for the purpose so designed.

7

Then under the Mixed Residential Zone, 16 Permissible Uses

have been listed out. They are as follows:

1. Residential Buildings

2. Hostels/Guest houses with a minimum plot size 500 sqm.

3. Customer Care Services with a minimum plot size of 250

sqm.

4. Restaurants with a minimum plot size 300 sqm.

5. Shops and Retail shops

6. Bakery and Cafeteria-minimum plot size-250 sqm.

7. Professional offices with a minimum plot size 300 sqm.

8. Bank, insurance and financial institutions with a minimum

plot size 500 sqm.

9. Medical centers with a minimum plot size 300 sqm.

10. Religious places with a minimum plot size 1000 sqm.

11. Vehicle parks

12. Pre-schools and daycare centers with a minimum plot size

1000 sqm.

13. Primary Educational Institutions-minimum plot size 2000

sqm.

14. Secondary Educational Institutions-minimum plot size 3000

sqm

15. Social & cultural centers with a minimum plot size 250 sqm.

16. Parks and Play Grounds

The 15th and 16th Respondentsthe Kaduwela Municipal Council

in paragraph 4 of their statement of objections state that: the

building constructed on Elipichchawatte Road is a duly approved

building in terms of the UDA regulations and the said building

plan has been approved in 2015.

8

However, it is significant to note that, they do not, either in the

said objections or in the written submissions explain why they

say that the warehouse in question is a duly approved building

in terms of the Urban Development Act Regulations.

The argument of the Municipal Council seems to be that in

terms of clause 2.2 of the Regulations, which states that, Where

the use of a site or premises is not designated for a specific use,

its use shall be in conformity with the use permissible in the zone

where it lies, a warehouse can be allowed in a Mixed Residential

Zone. It is not clear what exactly is meant by Where the use of

a site or premises is not designated for a specific use and the

applicability of that part to the present issue. Be that as it may,

I assume, what they are trying to do is to equalize a warehouse

with a hostel, guest house, restaurant, shop, bakery, cafeteria,

medical center, religious place, educational institution, park,

playground etc. and to say that warehouse is another

Permissible Use in a Mixed Residential Zone. That is completely

against the ejusdem generis rule.1 I have no hesitation to

conclude that the warehouse, which is admittedly a commercial

building (as stated in the Development Permit A2) cannot be

accommodated in a Mixed Residential Zone and it shall be

accommodated in a Commercial Zone. Incidentally, under the

Commercial Zone, the 1st item is Commercial Institutions.

Hence, the building is in terms of the Urban Development

Authority Regulations is unacceptable and the approval given by

the Kaduwela Urban Council by document marked A5/8R5

dated 24.07.2015 is ultra vires.

1 Where a law lists specific classes of persons or things and then refers to them in general, the general statements only apply to the same kind of persons or things specifically listed.

9

In any event, that Permit, as it is expressly stated in clause 1

thereof, is valid only for one year and therefore has long expired

by 24.07.2015 and this action was filed on 15.09.2016.

Furthermore, according to clause 9 of the Permit, that approval

is subject to obtaining the other approvals from other relevant

Agencies.

Whatever may be the reason which they try to adduce, the 15th

and 16th Respondents in paragraph 12(iv) of their objections

have admitted that the Certificate of Conformity in respect of

that warehouse has not yet been issued notwithstanding the

warehouse is admittedly in operation. The fact that the

Certificate of Conformity is yet to be issued has been admitted

by the 18th Respondent-Developer himself by tendering A10.

In terms of clause 7 of the Permit A5, the Certificate of

Conformity needs to be issued before the commencement of the

operations.

The fact that the Certificate of Conformity is yet to be issued

goes to show that the contention that the building is complete

and therefore this application is futile is untenable. The issue

is, arguably, still live, even if the first part of the mandamus is

concerned, which is the prevention of construction of the

building. In any event, the second part of the mandamus, which

is the prevention of operation of the business in the building, is,

undoubtedly, a live issue.

At this juncture, I must also make reference to the Wrongdoer

Principle, which seems to be the further development of the

Roman-Dutch Law principle spoliatus ante debet omnia

10

restituendus est2. The Wrongdoer Principle demands: A

wrongdoer shall not be allowed to benefit out of his own

wrongdoing. Vide Seelawathie Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne3,

Subramanium v. Shabdeen4, Kariyawasam v. Sujatha Janaki5.

Even assuming without conceding that a warehouse can be

accommodated in the Mixed Residential Zone, there is a more

serious and more compelling reason why the Kaduwela

Municipal Council could not have given permission to build a

warehouse in the place it has been built.

According to the objections of the 8th-10th Respondentsthe

Central Environment Authority, the warehouse is (according to

Gazettes 8R2 and 8R3) in the sensitive area (as close as only

20-22 meters away from the embankment of the Kelani River)

and therefore the construction of any building, irrespective of

the size or purpose, which is within 60 meters from a bank of a

public stream, shall need prior approval of the Central

Environmental Authority. Admittedly, no such approval has

been taken from the Central Environmental Authority before the

commencement of this commercial building. This is a serious

matter.

The Central Environmental Authority, upon the complaints

made to it, has conducted a site inspection of the premises on

23.02.2016. A copy of the said Inspection Report has been

marked as 8R1. The findings of the said site inspection are

appalling. That Report inter alia confirms that the 18th

2 That means the party dispossessed ought first of all to be restored. Vide Enso Nona v. Somawathie [1998] 3 Sri LR 239 at 244. 3 [1982] 1 Sri LR 384 4 [1984] 1 Sri LR 48 at 56 5 [2013] BLR 77

11

Respondentthe Developer, having started the construction

without prior approval from the Central Environmental

Authority, has, in that process, cleared the River Reservation

and removed soil about 4-5 feet in depth from the embankment

of the Kelani River, which could lead to disastrous situations

including flooding during rains.

Then the Central Environmental Authority has by X12 dated

01.04.2016 informed the 12th Respondentthe Director General

of Irrigation Department (with copies to the 18th Respondent-the

Developer, the 15th Respondent-The Commissioner, Municipal

Council, Kaduwela, the 5th Respondent-the Director

(Enforcement) of the Urban Development Authority, the 13th

Respondent-the Director General, Disaster Management Centre

and the 17th Respondent-the Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Angoda), to stop the construction immediately.

The body of X12, which is self-explanatory, reads as follows:

82/2

(emphasis mine)

Then the Central Environmental Authority has by X11 dated

04.04.2016 with copies to the other parties separately informed

the 18th Respondentthe Developer to stop the construction

immediately.

The body of X11 reads as follows:

.

2. , 4-5

. (emphasis mine)

However, the 18th Respondent has not stopped the construction.

Therefore, the Central Environmental Authority by X13 dated

25.04.2016 with copies to the other parties has informed the

17th Respondentthe Officer in Charge of Angoda Police to take

steps to stop the construction forthwith.

The body of X13 reads as follows:

82/2

2016.04.04

2016.04.25

.

.

.

(emphasis mine)

Thereafter the Central Environmental Authority has conducted

the second field inspection on 28.04.2016. A copy of that Report

has been marked as 8R4. At the end of the Report, the following

strong recommendation has been made:

14

:-

1993-06-24 772/22

. (emphasis mine)

Thereafter the Central Environmental Authority has filed an

action against the 18th Respondent-Developer under the

National Environmental Act in the Magistrates Court of

Kaduwela and upon pleading guilty, he has been imposed a fine

of Rs.10,000/=.

Thereupon the Central Environmental Authority has issued

8R11 dated 30.08.2016a No Objection Lettersubject to a

number of conditions, the first of which is The warehouse

should conform to the zoning plan of the area. It is noteworthy

that this letter has been addressed not to the 18th Respondent-

Developer, but to the 15th Respondentthe Commissioner,

Municipal Council, Kaduwela. As I have already stated, the

warehouse does not conform to the zoning plan of the area. On

the other hand, it is difficult to understand how even a No

Objection Letter can thus be given to an unauthorized

commercial construction built arbitrarily very close to the Kelani

River causing wanton damage to the embankment of the

rivervide X11-X13. The attention of the Court was not drawn

to any provision of the law, which empowers the Authority to

issue such letters.

The 12th Respondentthe Director General of Irrigation

Department has not filed objections to the main application.

15

However, according to the documents marked 12R2 and 12R3

tendered with the limited objections of the said Respondent in

respect of the application for interim relief, the construction is

completely illegal.

12R2 dated 09.03.2016 written by the Provincial Irrigation

Engineer to the Municipal Commissioner reads as follows:

82/2 .75

.

. (emphasis mine)

16

According to paragraph 3 of the said letter, the Irrigation

Engineer has thought that the Permit A5 tendered by the 18th

Respondent-Developer is a forged document! That itself speaks

volumes about the validity of the Permit. No responsible

governmental Agency would have issued such a Permit.

The same officer by 12R3 dated 11.04.2016 addressed to the

18th Respondent has informed as follows:

2015.06.19 457/15

.

. (emphasis

Thereafter, as seen from A6-A8, the 18th Respondent, having

done the damage, has undertaken to put up a gabion wall to

arrest river bank erosion.

17

In this regard, the letter X17 sent by the 13th

RespondentDisaster Management Centre to the Central

Environmental Authority dated 10.06.2016 with copies to the

other stakeholders is also relevant. It reads as follows:

82/2

From the above, it is clear that, the Kaduwela Urban Council

could not have given approval to the 18th Respondent-Developer

to construct a warehouse in the place where it has been

constructed, firstly, because it is a Mixed Residential Zone, and,

18

secondly, and more importantly, the place of construction is

only about 20-22 meters away from the embankment of the

Kelani river, which is a highly sensitive area.

I order the 15th and 16th Respondents by way of mandamus to

take steps to immediately stop operation of the unauthorized

warehouse relevant to this action.

Without quashing the decision by way of certiorari, can the

Court stop the implementation of that decision? In the first

place, there is no decision to quash except A5 which has already

lapsed.6 Even if there is one, the said mandamus would do what

certiorari wanted to do. Professor Wade says: If on the other

hand a mandamus is granted without certiorari, the necessary

implication is that the defective decision is a nullity, for it is only

on this assumption that the mandamus can operate. A simple

mandamus therefore does the work of certiorari automatically.7

In recent times, this has been recognized as certiorarified

mandamus.8

The 15th and 16th Respondents (the Kaduwela Municipal

Council) shall pay Rs.200,000/= as costs of this action to the

Petitioners.
