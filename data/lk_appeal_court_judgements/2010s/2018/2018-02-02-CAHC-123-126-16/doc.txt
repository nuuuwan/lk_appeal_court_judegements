The appellants were indicted in the High Court of Kalmunai under

section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of A.M. Mohamed alias

Samurdeen Thandayal on the 18th of June 2009. After trial all the

appellants were convicted and sentenced to death.

Prosecution Witness Number 1 giving evidence has stated that on

the 18th of June 2009 around 8.30 p.m. when he was riding the bicycle

with the deceased towards his house the fourth accused appellant had

come and held the handle of the bicycle inquiring about cutting of a fishing

net in his boat and has said that he will make a complaint to the police.

The fourth appellant has said that he came after he received a phone call.

While they were talking the second appellant had come from behind and

struck the deceased on his back with a wooden club and the deceased

had fallen. The first and third appellants have also come with his shouting

"hold and hit" in tamil. Thereafter witness has been chased away by the

appellant. Prosecution Witness Number 2 has testified that he saw the

first, second and third appellants running at about 8.30 p.m. that day.

The medical evidence has revealed that the deceased had died on

the 18th night from an injury caused to his head.

The learned counsel for the appellants stated that they are only

contesting the sentence and not the conviction. He also submitted that

the fourth appellant should have been acquitted on the basis that he met

the deceased by chance and was talking to him when the deceased was

attacked. Prosecution Witness Number 1 in his evidence has stated that

he did not see from where the first, second and third appellants came.

(vide page number 105 of the brief).

Pages 356 to 400 of the brief shows that the cross examination and

re-examination of the second appellant has been recorded in the

narrative form. The questions asked by the learned High Court Judge

(page 396) is also recorded in the narrative form. (Q.A. there is a stab

injury on the head). We find in difficult to fathom as to what questions

were posed to the appellant.

Section 273 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Acts provides

thus;

1. In the High Court and Magistrate's Courts, the evidence of each

witness shall be taken down in writing by the Judge or in his

presence and hearing and under his personal direction and

superintendence and shall be signed and dated by the Judge

and where the evidence is taken at an inquiry shall also be

signed by the interpreter if any who shall have been employed.

2. The evidence shall not ordinarily be taken down in the form 0/

question and answer but in the form 0/ a narrative, but the

Judge may in his discretion take down any particular question

and answer.

Provided however that in the High Court the evidence shall be

taken down in question and answer.

We find that the learned High Court Judge was not mindful of the

said provision and the procedure to follow in recording evidence in a

criminal trial. Although the learned counsel for the appellants did not bring

this irregularity to our notice we wish to place on record that this type of

conduct by a High Court Judge can not be condoned. The second

appellant was not given a fair trial.

For the afore stated reason we decide to send the case back for

retrial. Judgment dated 22.06.2016 is set aside and a retrial is ordered.

I agree.
