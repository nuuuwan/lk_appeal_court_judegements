10th September 2018

osth October 2018

When this matter was taken up for argument on 11th July 2018, learned

Counsel for all parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment on the

written submissions that the parties would tender. However, this Court

observes that written submissions have not been tendered on behalf of the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st - 4th Respondents to

register 'Powergesic Gel', which is an anti-inflammatory drug used to

treat pain;

3

(b) A Writ of Certiorar,i to quash the decision of the 1st - 4th Respondents to

register the 5th Respondent as a supplier of Pharmaceuticals products to

Sri Lanka;

(c) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st - 4th Respondents to cancel the

registration issued in respect of 'Powergesic Gel'.

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that he is a businessman involved in the building and

construction industry. He claims that he has instituted this application on his

own behalf and in the Public Interest to "prevent grave detriment being

caused to Social Security & Welfare of the people or the citizens of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."

The Petitioner claims that he is a regular user of 'Powergesic gel' and that on

or about 15th February 2016, he purchased a tube of 'Powergesic Gel' from a

pharmacy.l The Petitioner claims that upon application of the said gel, he

developed an unbearable irritation and burning sensation. The Petitioner

claims to have seen a doctor and states that his doctor had identified the

presence of the substance 'Methyl Salicylic acid', a compound not mentioned

in the list of ingredients in the said gel, to be the cause of the alleged allergic

reaction. The Petitioner has not annexed any proof to establish how this un-

named doctor came to such a conclusion nor has the Petitioner annexed any

supporting material from this doctor.

I In proof of such purchase, the Petitioner has annexed a hand written receipt, marked Ip6', the authenticity of which has been disputed by the 5th Respondent,

4

The said gel has been manufactured in India by the 5th Respondent and the

registration2 to import the said gel to Sri Lanka issued by the 1st Respondent,

the National Medicines Regulatory Authoritl was held during this period by a

company which we shall refer to as 'AAA', for the reason that the said

company is not a party to this application. By letter dated 1 ih February 2016,

annexed to the petition marked 'P7', the Petitioner complained to 'AAA'

about the aforementioned incident.

The Petitioner states that' AAA' had referred samples of 'Powergesic Gel' to

an analytical laboratory, which confirmed the presence of 'Methyl Salicylate'

in the sample produced to the said laboratory. Although a copy of the test

report has been annexed to the petition, marked as 'P8(f),4, the Petitioner has

not disclosed to this Court as to how he obtained a copy of the said report.

The Petitioner claims that 'Methyl Salicylic Acid' has multiple adverse side

effects but has failed to submit any credible proof in support of this claim.

This position of the Petitioner has been denied by the 1st Respondent, who

has taken up the position that 'Methyl Salicylate' is a common ingredient in

many analgesic balms and that there is no truth to the claim of the Petitioner

2 The Certificate of Registration issued by the 15t Respondent National Medicines Regulatory

Authority has been annexed to the petition, marked 'p5'.

J The National Medicines Regulatory Authority has been established in terms of the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No.5 of 2015. It functions inter olio as the central regulator for all matters connected with the registration and licensing of medicines. Section 58 (1) thereof specifies that, "no person shall manufacture or import any medicine without registering such medicine with the Authority and obtaining a license from the Authority therefor".

4 The test report 'P8(f), does not disclose the presence of 'Methyl Salicylic acid' as claimed by the

Petitioner but only the presence of 'Methyl Salicylate', which, according to the 5th Respondent are two different compounds.

5

that the said ingredient causes adverse effects. The Petitioner claims further

that the presence of 'Methyl Salicylic acid' in the said gel has not been

declared by the manufacturer, either on the packaging or in the data

submitted by 'AAA' at the time it sought the Certificate of Registration in

respect thereof, from the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent has a statutory duty in terms of

the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No.5 of 2015 to ensure the

availability of safe and efficacious drugs and that if any drug is unsafe for

human use, the registration should be cancelled. The Petitioner has claimed

that the said gel is unsafe for human use as it contains 'Methyl Salicylic acid'.

It is on this basis that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

registration issued in respect of the said gel as well as to quash the

registration of the 5th Respondent as a supplier of pharmaceutical products to

Sri Lanka.

It appears from the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent that the 1st

Respondent was not aware of this incident until the filing of this application.

The Petitioner has not produced any documents to establish that he had

brought this incident to the attention of the 1st Respondent nor has the

Petitioner explained why he has not, at the least, informed the 1st Respondent

of this incident. The 1st Respondent has taken up the position that 'AAA',

being the holder of the Certificate of Registration during the time the

purported incident occurred, was under a duty to notify the 1st Respondent of

any information received which cast doubt on the continued validity of the

data that has been submitted by 'AAA' itself in connection with the

6

application for the Certificate of RegistrationS but that 'AAA' has not

complained to the 1st Respondent.

The National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act contains stringent standards

that an applicant seeking the registration of a drug must meet and detailed

provisions with regard to the steps that should be taken by the 1st

Respondent prior to the registration of a drug.6 The Petitioner has not

produced any material to establish that the registration by the 1st Respondent

of the said gel, as evidenced by 'PS', has been irregular or that the said

registration should be cancelled. In the absence of any evidence of

wrongdoing by the 1st Respondent, this Court does not see any merit in this

application nor any legal basis to issue the Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus

prayed for.

5 Regulation 8 (b) of the Regulations made by the Minister of Health, under Section 38 of the Cosmetics, Devises and Drugs Act, No. 27 of 1980 as amended and published in Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 378/3 dated 02"d December 1985, produced by the 1st Respondent, marked "Rl", reads as follows: ''The holder of a Certificate of Registration of a drug shall forthwith inform or notify the Authority of any information received by him that casts doubt on the continued validity of the data which was submitted with, or in connection with the application for the registration of the drug, for the purpose of assessing the safety, quality or efficacy of the drug."

6 Section 59 of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No.5 of 2015 reads inter alia as follows:

(1) Any person who intends to manufacture or import any medicine shall make an application for the registration of that medicine in the prescribed form to the Authority. (2) The application shall be accompanied by the prescribed particulars, the samples of the medicine and the prescribed fee. (4) The Authority shall upon receipt of an application submit that application together with the sample of the medicine and all particulars, available-(a) to the Medicines Evaluation Committee, for the revaluation of the application and the medicine considering the need to ensure the availability of efficacious, safe and good quality medicine relevant to the healthcare needs of the public at an affordable price; and (b) to the National Medicines Quality Assurance Laboratory, for testing of the quality of the medicine.

7

This Court is of the view that a reasonable person claiming to act in the public

interest would have complained to the 1st Respondent of any sub-standard

drug in the market. The conduct of the Petitioner and 'AAA' in not reporting

this incident to the 1st Respondent gives rise to suspicion whether this

application has been filed with an ulterior motive. It is in this context that this

Court would like to examine t~~~~~lIm_~rl!sraised in!he writt~n submissions

filed on behalf of the: _5th RespondeRtnameiy-::that the--!>-etitionerhas

deliberately withheld material facts from this Court and misrepresented to . . this Court material facts and thereby abused the due process of this Court by

filing this application.

The 5th Respondent, who is a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products in

India and which is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, has stated that 'AAA'

was appointed as the distributor of all its products in Sri Lanka in August 2008

for a period of 10 years. Due to various issues that had arisen between the 5th

Respondent and 'AAA', the 5th Respondent had terminated the Distributorship

with 'AAA' with effect from 1st March 2016, as evidenced by letter dated 25th

November 2015 produced by the 5th Respondent marked 'SR3'. Thus, at the

time of the alleged incident (Le. 15th February 2016), the relationship

between the 5th Respondent and 'AAA' was strained. It is in this factual

background that the 5th Respondent claims that this application has been

instigated by 'AAA' as a result of the termination of their business relationship

and that this is a collusive action between the Petitioner and 'AAA'.

In order to prove this position, the 5th Respondent has submitted that the

Petitioner is the Managing Director of a company named, 'MN Homes

Developers (Pvt) Limited' which is engaged in the construction business and

8

.. that according to the website of this company, it has undertaken several

construction projects for 'AAA', the Managing Director of 'AAA' and for

related companies of 'AAA'. This is borne out by the documents produced by

the Petitioner marked 'SR10', which the 5th Respondent states has been

downloaded from the website of the said company. This Court observes that

apart from a bare denial, the Petitioner has not said anything in his counter

affidavit in this regaJd-~Ibe:~eJ1U(mer h~snot disclosedtouthis CQu.r:tctl1at=b~_= __

has a relationship with 'AAA', either personal or business. In fact, as set out

". ", earlier, the Petitioner has claimed that he is filing this application not only for

himself but also in the public interest. This Court is of the view that the

existence of this relationship should have been disclosed to this Court by the

Petitioner, as it is material and has a direct bearing on the facts of this

application and the relief claimed by the Petitioner.

Our Courts have consistently held that a party invoking the Writ jurisdiction of

this Court must come with clean hands and utmost good faith. The Supreme

Court in Liyanage & another v Ratnasirl, Divisional Secretary, Gampaha &

Others7 citing the case of Jayasinghe v National Institut~ of Fisheries and

Nautical Engineering and Others8 has held as follows:

"The conduct of the Petitioner in withholding these material facts from

Court shows a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner. When

a litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into

a contractual obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship

7 2013 (1) Sri LR 6 at page 15.

8 2002 (1) Sri LR 277.

9

requires the Petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly.

This is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from Court.

In the case of Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Limited v. Wilfred Van Eis and Two

Others9, the Court highlighted this contractual obligation which a party

enters- into with the-Cottrt, requi-ring-the-need-t-odisc-lose uberrima fides

and disclose all materi~fI facts fully andlrankJ~tto C6urt.

c Any party wno---

misleads Court, misrepresents facts to Court or utters fals~hood in Co~rt

will not be entitled to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established

proposition of law, since Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank

and open with the Court. This principle has been applied even in an

application that has been made to challenge a decision made without

jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go into the merits of the case in such

situations."

In Timberlake International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. The Conservator General of

Forests10, the Supreme Court, having held that the conduct of an applicant

seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is of great relevance because such

Writs, being prerogative remedies, are not issued as of right, and are

dependent on the discretion of court, stated as follows:

lilt is trite law that any person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to show

uberrimae fides or (utmost) good faith, and disclose all material facts to

9 1997 (1) Sri LR 360.

10 S.c. Appeal No: 06/2008 SC Minutes of 2nd March 2010.

10

this Court to enable it to arrive at a correct adjudication on the issues

arising upon this application."

The 5th Respondent has referred to several other matters that have either

been suppressed from this Court or misrepresented by the Petitioner. The

nec~ssit'Lto go into such malters doe_s not arise as this Court is of the view

that the non-disclosure of the relationship between the Petitioner and'AAA'

is sufficient for this Court to uphold the argument of the 5th Respondent ~hat

the Petitioner has not come to Court with clean hands. This Court is of the

view that the Petitioner has breached its duty by this Court and has

deliberately suppressed its relationship with 'AAA' to this Court. It is apparent

to this Court that had this relationship been disclosed, this Court would not

have issued notices on the Respondents in the first instance. On this basis

alone, this Court is of the view that this application is liable to be dismissed.

If the facts disclosed in the petition are examined in the light of the

aforementioned material placed before this Court by the 5th Respondent, it

becomes apparent that this application is a collusive action between the

Petitioner and 'AAA' and has been filed by the Petitioner for a collateral

purpose. How else could one explain the failure of the Petitioner or 'AAA' not

to refer the alleged incident to the 1st Respondent or the deliberate

withholding of the relationship between the Petitioner and 'AAA'? Taking into

consideration all of the above, it is evident to this Court that the Petitioner

has filed this application for a collateral purpose and has abused the process

of Court, on which basis too, this application is liable to be dismissed.

11

There is one other matter that this Court would like to advert to, which is the

analytical report marked 'P8(t)' submitted by the Petitioner which claims to

have found evidence of 'Methyl Salicylate' in the samples submitted by'AAA'.

In the light of the displeasure that existed between 'AAA' and the 5th

Respondent during this period, the mere fact of the samples being submitted

__ by~AA~' (or testi_nK is sUfficient to raise a doubt \tVi~tl regard t()Jheintegrity 91

-the sampLesthat-were-siveR fol" analysis~

The 5th Respondent has categorically stated that 'Methyl Salicylate' is not an

ingredient contained in 'Powergesic gel'. According to the 5th Respondent, in

accordance with good manufacturing practices, it retains samples of each

batch of the gel. After this application was filed, the 5th Respondent had

initiated an analytical test of two samples taken from the same batch of the

gel as the one tested by 'AAA', at an analytical laboratory in India. According

to the test report of the said laboratory in India, submitted by the 5th

Respondent marked 'SR1S(c), and 'SR1S(d)', there is no evidence of 'Methyl

Salicylate' in the samples of 'Powergesic gel' forwarded by the 5th

Respondent. While this Court cannot come to any conclusions on the

contents of the said gel, it appears to this Court that the allegation of the

Petitioner that the said gel contains 'Methyl Salicylic Acid' is unfounded

The final matter that this Court needs to decide is whether costs should be

ordered, taking into consideration all of the circumstances of this case and

the conduct of the Petitioner. In this regard, this Court would be guided by

the following observation of the Supreme Court in leon Peris Kumarasinghe

vs. Samantha Weliveriya:ll

II s.c. Spl. L.A. No. 37/2012 - SC Minutes of 12th November 2013.

12

"This Court cannot over emphasize the need to appropriately deal with

litigants who attempt to abuse the process of Court and thereby cause

unnecessary delay and costs to other parties, in order to ensure that in

the future, litigants will not be tempted to indulge in such iII- conceived

pl'aGtices."

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in this . . application and accordingly dismisses this application, with costs fixed at Rs.

200,000 payable by the Petitioner to the State.
