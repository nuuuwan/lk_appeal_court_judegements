Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Nimal Jayasinghe for the Petitioner.

P.S. Amarasinghe for the 1st and 2nd

Respondents.

Decided on: 10.12.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application against the 1st and 2nd

respondentsthe Secretary and the Officer in Charge of the

Beruwala Pradeshiya Sabhaseeking to quash P10 by way of a

writ of certiorari and to compel the respondents to approve Plan

No.246 by way of a writ of mandamus.

Plan No.246 is a Final Partition Plan prepared after an appeal

Judgment of this Court.

By P10 the 2nd respondent has refused to approve that Plan on

two grounds: (a) there is no turning circle on the road; and (b)

the Plan is not in conformity with the regulations made under

the Urban Development Authority Act.

It is not clear which end of the road, the respondents expect to

have a turning circle. When one looks at Plan No.246, definitely

it cannot be at the beginning of the Jailani Road. Then from the

other end, there is no necessity to have a turning circle as this

road is to be used as a common road only to the two Lots

marked A and B.

The Plan is not in conformity with the regulations made under

the Urban Development Authority Act is a general statement.

The respondents shall be specific on that point. The

respondents in their objections stating that The petitioner is

presumed to know the relevant regulations of the Urban

Development Authority which have been published in the

Government Gazette, has annexed a copy of the Gazette running

into 18 pages. Even at this stage both the petitioner and the

Court are unaware which regulation or regulations of the said

Gazette, the Plan is not in conformity with.

The respondents have in the objections taken up the position

that the decision in P10 has been taken not by the respondents,

but by the Planning Committee of the Beruwala Pradeshiya

Sabha comprising of seven members, and without them being

made parties, this application is not maintainable.

When the application cannot be defended on merits, it is usual

to cling on high technical objections. I am firmly of the view that

cases must, as far as possible, be disposed of on merits and not

on high technical grounds. These are Courts of Justice and not

Academies of Law where high-flown theories are taught.1 In this

regard, I fully endorse the following observations made by

Justice Wigneswaran in Senanayake v. Siriwardene:2

Courts are fast making use of technical grounds and traversing

of procedural guidelines to dispose of cases without reaching out

to the core of the matters in issue and ascertain the truth to bring

justice to the litigants. This tendency is most unfortunate. It could

boomerang on the judiciary as well as the existing judicial

system.

P10 has been signed by the 2nd respondent. It has not been

signed on behalf of or by order of the Planning Committee of the

Beruwala Pradeshiya Sabha.

In any event, the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha, who is the

chief administrative officer according to section 9 of the

Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No.15 of 1987, as amended, has been

1 Vellupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District Council (1936) 39 NLR 464 at 465, W.M. Mendis & Co. v. Excise Commissioner [1999] 1 Sri LR 351 at 354-355 2 [2001] 2 Sri LR 371 at 375

made a party. That is sufficient compliance for the present

purpose.

I reject that technical objection.

Having rejected that technical objection, I must also state the

following. P10 is dated 21.01.2015. No submissions have been

made by either party on the question whether the Pradeshiya

Shabha was in operation when this application was filed before

this Court on 30.06.2015. It appears to me (subject to

correction) that the Pradeshiya Shabha seized to exist by

operation of law as the term of the Pradeshiya Shabhas expired

on 15.05.2015. If that is correct, in terms of section 9(3) of the

Act, it was the duty of the 1st respondent-Secretary to discharge

all the duties on behalf of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

I quash P10 by certiorari and compel the respondents by

mandamus to approve the Plan without further ado.

Application is allowed with costs.
