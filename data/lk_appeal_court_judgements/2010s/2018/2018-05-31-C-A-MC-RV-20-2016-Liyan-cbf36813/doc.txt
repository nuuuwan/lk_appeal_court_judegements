application for revision filed in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution

and has directed this court to take appropriate steps after noticing

parties. The Supreme Court has directed this court to make a suitable

sentence pertaining to the payment of compensation of Rs. 80,000/-

by the accused in each of these 11 cases. Learned Magistrate is
