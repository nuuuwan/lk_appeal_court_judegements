ORDER

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Petitioners are candidates who have sat for the open/ limited

competitive examinations for recruitment to class III of the Sri Lanka

Accountants' service - 2016. The Gazette notification relating to the

conduct of this examination has been produced marked P 13.

Commissioner General of Examinations who is the 13th Respondent named

in this application has invalidated the above examination held on 22nd 23 rd

and 29th April 2017 and has notified that the said examination would be

conducted again. The newspaper advertisement setting out the above

position has been produced marked P 24.

8

By the newspaper advertisement produced marked P 25 the 13th

Respondent has notified that the steps have been taken to conduct the

said exam at Colombo and Jaffna towns on 27th 28th January and 3rd

February 2018.

Petitioners in this application have prayed for,

I. a writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision invalidating the

examination held previously

II. a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to hold a fresh examination

on the 27h 28th January and 3rd February 2018

III. a writ of Mandamus against the 13th Respondent to send the results

(marks) of the previously held examination to all the candidates

including the petitioners who sat for the said examinations

IV. a writ of Mandamus against the 2nd to 12th Respondents to select and

appoint the candidates who had 'obtained high marks of merit' on the

said previously'heid examination for the post of class III of the Sri

Lanka Accountant Service 2016/ 2017

V. a writ of Mandamus against the 14th and lsth Respondents to assure

the selected candidates for the recruitment to class III of the Sri

Lanka Accountant Service

\

9

VI. an interim relief to stay the validity or operation of notices marked P

24 and P 25 and to stay conducting of the written examination

scheduled to be held on 27th 28th January and 3rd February 2018 as

per said advertisement until the final determination of this

application.

Learned Senior State Counsel upon being given notice by the Petitioners of

this application was present in Court on 2018-01-16 when the learned

counsel for the Petitioner first supported this application. Having obtained

time to obtain instructions from the Respondents learned Senior State

Counsel on the next day i.e. on 2018-01-23 brought to the notice of this

Court relevant documents which showed the basis for the said cancellation.

Learned Senior State Counsel subsequently filed these documents in this

Court. Learned counsel for the Petitioners advanced the following

arguments,

I. that the 13:h Respondent has no power to invalidate the. said

examination and to hold fresh examinations

II. that it is the Public Service Commission which has the power to

cancel the said exam as per clause 1 of the Gazette notification

bearing No.1, 992 dated 2016-11-04 produced marked P 13

10

III. that there were no irregularities reported to have been committed

during he previously held exam

IV. that there is no valid reason for the 13th Respondent to invalidate the

said examination.

The said grounds have been more fully set out by the Petitioners in

paragraph 9 of their Petition. It would appear that the fundamental basis

for this application according to the averments in the petition is that the

issuance of notices marked P 24 and P 25 are ultra-wires the powers of

the 13th Respondent.

This Court perused the documents filed by the learned Senior State

Counsel. The said documents show that it is the Public Service Commission

which has decided to invalidate the said examination. This is reflected in

the letter dated 2017-11-30 addressed to the 13th Respondent by the

Secretary to the Public Service Commission. Such invalidation has been

provided for by clause 1 of the Gazette notification above mentioned. In

these circumstances complaint of the Petitioners that the 13th Respondent

had acted ultra-wires his powers cannot be accepted.

Perusal of the letter dated 2017-11-27 by the 13th Respondent addressed

to the Secretary Public Service Commission who is the 3rd Respondent,

11

shows clearly that the recommendation made by the 13th Respondent to

invalidate this examination is not without reasons. Indeed learned Senior

State Counsel has tendered for perusal of this Court the report dated 2017-

11-20 of the committee appOinted to report on the irregularities

complained by public. It is on the finding of that report that the

Commissioner General of Examinations had recommended invalidation of

this examination to the Public Service Commission.

This Court has perused the documents and is satisfied that there is no

basis for this Court to issue notices on the Respondents.

Further, conducting a fresh examination cannot be considered as only

affecting the Petitioners. There are a lot of other candidates who have sat

for the previous examination and are expecting to sit for the fresh

examination also. The Petitioners have not made them Respondents to this

application. Under those circumstances this Court is unable to gather

information as to how the other candidates would be affected by the

request of the Petitioners.

The jurisdiction to issue writs in the nature of certiorari and Mandamus

which is vested in this Court by virtue of article 140 of the constitution is a

III

~ IIIt

fI

Jf t

12

jurisdiction which this Court could decide in its discretion to exercise in a fit

case. This Court is not inclined to assist anyone to uphold the validity of

any irregularly conducted examination.

In these circumstances this Court decides to refuse issuing notices on the

Respondents.

This Application should therefore stand dismissed without costs.
