COUNSEL Daya Guruge for the Plaintiff-Appellant

Decided on 08.01.2018

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ,J.

'The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted this 1 action against the 1st to 3rd Defendant-Respondents, (hereinafter referred to as

"the Defendants") on 13.01.1986 praying for a declaration that he is the owner of the

land morefully described in the schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the Defendants

therefrom and for damages and costs.

The Defendants filed their answer on 01.12.1986 stating that the Plaintiffs have no

right to the land described in the schedule to the plaint.

On these averments, the court issued a commission to surveyor E.G. Banduthilaka,

whose Plan No.476/90 and Report are filed of record, marked 'X' and 'Y'

respectively.

Thereafter the Plaintiff filed an amended plaint which was followed by an amended

answer by the Defendants. In paragraph 3 of the amended answer the Defendants

state that they do not claim any right to Lots 1 and 2 depicted in the said Plan

No.476/90 which are part of the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint.

The Plaintiff traces his title to the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint

from one Rajapakse Mudiyanselage alias Liyanaralalage Appuhamy who became

entitled to it by a Crown Grant marked PI. In the same manner, he states that the

land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint, which belonged to the Crown, was

allotted to Liyanaralalage alias Rajapakse Mudiyanselage Kavirala and Appuhamy by

P2. The plaintiff's position is that after the death of these persons their rights

devolved on Kirimenika, who was the plaintiff's mother, and after her death the

Plaintiff became entitled to the said lands.

The defendants' position is that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the land described in

the 2nd schedule to the plaint, and they are entitled to it. They also state that the

person referred to as Kavirala in paragraph 5 of the plaint is a different person and

Kavirala who is referred to in the answer is the father of the 1st Defendant.

The Defendants also state in their amended answer that they do not claim rights

only to Lots 1 and 2 depicted in plan No.476/90 but Lot 3 in the said plan has been

possessed by them for over 60 years and thereby they have prescriptive title to the

same. They further state that Lots 3 and 4 have been possessed by the 1st Defendant

for over 60 years and he by Deed No.5827 had gifted it to the 2nd Defendant who

thus became entitled to the said Lots.

When the case was taken up for trial on 24.08.1996, one admission was recorded ~

namely the Defendants do not claim any right to Lots 1 and 2 in Plan No.476/90

made by B.G. Baduthilaka and filed in this case. Thereafter issues 1 to 12 were raised

on behalf of the Plaintiff and issues 13 to 28 were raised on behalf of the Defendants.

The Plaintiff claims that his lands described in 1st and 2nd schedules were depicted in

T.P. 360020 and T.P. 354328 and the extent of them is AI. OR. P.25 (lst schedule) and

AO. Rl. P29 (2nd Schedule), i.e. AI. R2. Pl4. According to Plan X, the extent of Lots 1

and 2 is Al.RO. P 05. and the extent of Lots 3 and 4 is AO. R2. P.09. The Defendants

claim their land as depicted in T.P. 354328.

The surveyor states in his report that Lot 1 which is part of T.P. 360020 and in

extent R.2 P.30, is possessed by the Plaintiff. Lot 2 is a part of T.P. 360020 and the

Plaintiff should be entitled to it but the Defendants are in possession. It is in extent

AO. Rl.P.15

The Plaintiff has given evidence producing PI, P2 and P3. The crux of the dispute is

that while the Plaintiff claims title to all the four lots depicted in Plan No.4 76/90,

the Defendants claim rights only to Lots 3 and 4 and disclaim rights to Lots 1 and 2.

As regards Lots 3 and 4, the surveyor states that Lot 3 is claimed by the Plaintiff but

it is in the possession of the Defendant. The report does not state to which T.P. this

lot belongs, whereas it is said that Lot 4 belongs to T.P. 354328, and claimed by the

Plaintiff but is encroached upon by the Defendants.

According to the Report 'Y' it is clear that Lots 1 and 2 in Plan No.476/90 are parts

of T.P. 360020. Since Lot 3 is not clearly stated as to whether it belongs to T.P.

360020 or T.P. 354328 and therefore it must be a separate lot and Lot 4 is a part of

T.P. 354328, which is claimed by both the Plaintiff and the Defendants.

It must be noted that the Defendants have produced a certified copy of the

Kurunegala Magistrate Court order (2D4) made under Section 66 of the Primary

Court Procedure Act in case No.l49301C. The parties to that case were the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant in this case. According to this order the 1st Defendant

Suddahamy had been in possession of the land in extent 1 Rood and 29 Perches

since 19.03.1965, and he has been placed in possession thereof by the Magistrate's

Court. The Plaintiff was directed to file a civil action and that is the present action.

This position is accepted by the Plaintiff in his evidence. (See proceedings of

04.11.1996). From this evidence it is clear that there was a dispute between the

Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant in respect of the land described in the 2nd schedule to

the plaint, and the 1st Defendant was admitted to be in possession thereof. If this be

so, the statement of the Plaintiff that the Defendants on or about 26.10.1985 forcibly

entered into the said land cannot be accepted.

It is also proved by the documents marked 2DS, 2D6 and 2D7 that the 1st Defendant

was in possession of the land called "Meegahakotuwa". It is also established that

along with Lot 4, the Defendants have been in possession of Lot 3 also as one land.

Since the surveyor has not clearly stated as to which Title Plan Lot 3 belongs, the

Plaintiff cannot claim this lot as part of his land, and it is stated to be a part of

Village Plan 7 ~ 1.

This is a rei vindicatio action, and as such when the title is disputed and the land is in

possession of the Defendants, it is the duty of the Plaintiff to prove his title. The

basic principle of a rei vindicatio action is that the Plaintiff must have title to the land

in dispute. Without a proper title, he cannot ask for a declaration. It is, therefore, to

be borne in mind that the burden is on the party who claims title to a property to

adduce evidence to prove his title to the satisfaction of the Court. If he has no title,

the Court cannot declare him entitled to the property. Our Courts have always

emphasized that the Plaintiff who institutes a vindicatory action must prove title-

See Wanigaratne v.JuwanisAppuhamy 65 N.LR. 67.

As against the possession of the Defendants in respect of Lots 3 and 4 in plan

No.476/90, the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title. Mere Crown Grant will not

confer title without clear proof of devolution of title flowing from it. In this case, the

Plaintiff has failed to establish his title to the said lands, though he has mentioned

the Crown Grants issued to his predecessors.

In Saiho v. Andris et al (3 N.LR.218) it was held that, "A sale of land by the Crown

and the issue of a Crown grant to the purchaser do not themselves raise a

presumption that the land was one over which the Crown had disposing power.

Lawrie]. (Bonser c.]. agreeing) expressed the view that "As to the presumption

arising from the nature of the land, a swamp, waste, or uncultivated land, which is

within the limits of or adjacent to cultivated land belonging to a private owner, will

not be presumed to be the property of the Crown".

I have gone into the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge made in this

case. The Trial Judge has carefully analyzed the oral evidence and the documents

produced by both parties. According to his findings, the person who received the

Crown Grant by PI and the person who received the Crown Grant by P2 are one

and the same person. This has been elicited from the evidence of the plaintiff.

Rajapakse Mudiyanselage alias Liyanaralalage Appuhamy who received the land by

PI and the recipient by PI Liyanaralalage Appuhamy cannot be two persons and the

plaintiff's pedigree flows from one person.

Considering the totality of the evidence led in this case, the learned Additional

District Judge has come to the conclusion that the Plaintiff has failed to establish his

title to Lots 3 and 4. That means the Plaintiff has failed to establish title to Lots 3

and 4 in Plan No.476/90. As the Defendants did not claim any right to Lots 1 and 2,

in Plan No.476/90, the Plaintiff is declared entitled to those lots, 1 and 2 only, which

are described in the 1st schedule to the plaint.

Subject to this variation, the judgment entered in this case is modified and the

appeal is allowed accordingly.
