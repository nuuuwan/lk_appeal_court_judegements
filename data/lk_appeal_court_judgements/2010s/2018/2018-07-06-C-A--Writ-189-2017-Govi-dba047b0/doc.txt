P Padman Surasena,l. (PLCA)

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor brought to the notice of this Court

"

the judgment in the case of Dayartne Vs. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of "

Lands and others reported in 2006 (1) S.L.R. page 7. This Court in that

judgment has held that a notice issued under section 2 of the Land

Acquisition Act is not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court, as

such notice does not by itself affect the rights of any person. Learned

Counsel for the Petitioner concedes that what is challenged in this

, ' 4

application is a notice issued under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act

which is produced marked P 17.

In these circumstances learned Counsel for the petitioner moves to

withdraw this appellation.

Application for withdrawal is allowed. Application is dismissed

without costs.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Shiran Gooneratne, J.

I agree.
