date of execution the executant was dead. Therefore it is the stance

of the prosecution that this couldn't have been executed on the said date.

The Notary who had executed the deed gave evidence and said that an

unknown person had come and executed on that date, which is mentioned

in the deed. Considering available material the learned President's Counsel

submits that it was executed a year ago and the notary has registered it

later. The deed was not sent for EQD and the accused-appellant had given

evidence in Court and called witnesses to the effect that this deed was

signed very much before the date mentioned in the deed. Further the

witness also submits that the deceased, the executant is known to the

Notary even he had attended the funeral of the executant. Therefore the

Notary claiming unknown person could not be accepted.

President's Counsel also submits that in this case the conviction

cannot stand because the accused-appellant has created reasonable doubts.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General maintaining the highest traditions of

the Attorney General's Department and submits that he is unable to

support the conviction because the available evidence, if it is evaluated on a

balance of probability can be weighed in favour of the prosecution but this

is a criminal case and a standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.

Considering the material submitted by the Accused-Appellant at the trial, he

submits that there is a reasonable doubt created in this case. Therefore he

is not supporting the conviction. Considering the submissions of both
