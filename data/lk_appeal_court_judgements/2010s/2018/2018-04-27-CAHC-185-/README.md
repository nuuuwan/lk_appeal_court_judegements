Judgment

S.Thurairaja PC J

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the appellant) was

originally indicted by the Hon. Attorney General before the High Court of Batticaloa

for abduction and Rape of a girl who was less than 16 years of age punishable under

section 354 and 364(2) of the Penal Code respectively. After the trial the Learned Trial

Judge found the Appellant not guilty to the charge of Rape and convicted him for the

charge of Abduction. Accordingly, the appellant was imposed 4 years Rigorous

Imprisonment. Being aggrieved with said order and the sentence the appellant

preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal and submitted following grounds of appeal.

1. Date of offence was not proved.

2. Prosecutrix evidence was rejected for one charge and accepted for another charge.

3. Dock Statement rejected without any reason.

The Prosecution called six witnesses to give evidence. 1. Rosali Udayakumar (virtual

Complainant), 2. Elizabeth Udayakumar (mother of the Prosecutrix), 3. Dr. Mohamed

Mustafa Abdul Rahman (Called to produce and explain the Meidco Legal Report of Dr.

Umakanthan), 4. WPS. 5076 Rajaramani Sudakaran (Who recorded the pt Complaint

and statements.), 5.WIP. Kankanam Gamage Shyamalie Dharshika (OIC), 6. John

Kandasamy (Court interpreter).

The Prosecution case is that, the accused appellant was attached to the Sri Lanka Army

as a driver, developed an affair with the virtual complainant, who was less than 14 years

old. He had abducted her and indulged in sexual intercourse. The offences which are

punishable under section 354 and 364(2) of the Penal Code. The Appellant defended

the charge and submitted that he did not commit this offence.

Perusing the evidence of the Virtual Complainant, she says that she had an affair with

the Appellant, on the 18th August 2003 she requested the appellant to take her away.

CA/185/2007 JUDGMENT Page 2 of4

She was taken to Colombo initially and spent a night at a Lodge, she claims that they

were involved in sexual intercourse, there she was bleeding from her vagina. Thereafter

they had gone to Kegalle to the house of the Appellant. The prosecutix was introduced

to the wife of the accused as sister of another soldier/ abandon girl from terrorist

group. She had spent about three days there and taken to Jayasinghe's place, who was

a friend of the appellant. There they stayed for about 10 days. On three nights she

claims she had sex with the appellant. Thereafter, they returned to Batticaloa. Where

the Police arrested them.

She was subjected to a medical examination and she had told the Doctor that she did

not have any sexual intercourse with the appellant. The JMO who examined the

Prosecutrix had found no injuries on the complainant especially Hyman, and it was

intact. The VOG examined her and opined that penetration is unlikely.

She was subject to cross examination and several vital contradictory positions were

elicited. She had told the Police that she didn't have any sexual intercourse but intra-

crural sex.

The learned Trial Judge after analysing the evidence of the Prosecutrix rejected the

same and found the appellant not guilty. On a perusal we too agree with the said

decision.

The Counsel for the Appellant submits that the date of the 1 st offence was not properly

proved. When the complainant gave evidence, she couldn't elicit the date, it was the

Prosecutor who had suggested the date. Subsequently she contradicted the period,

on one occasion she said she was at Jayasinghe's place for 6 days, 10 days a month

and so on. Now the question before us is that the complainant was not sure of the

date and her evidence was rejected by the learned Trial Judge on the 2nd count and

accepted for the 1st count. The Learned High Court Judge had not explained why he is

doing so.

CA/185/2007 JUDGMENT Page 3 of4

The Counsel for the Appellant submits it could have been clearly corroborated by

calling Jayasinghe who alleged to had the custody of the complainant for more than 6

days. It is not necessary to call certain number of witnesses to prove a fact but when

an evidence is rejected for one count accepting for another count in the same

indictment need to be after corroboration.

The appellant submits that he made a Dock Statement and the trial Judge did not

consider the defence hence he did not get a fair trial. We perused the Judgment

delivered by the High Court and it is evident that the learned Judge had not considered

the Dock Statement.

Time and again our courts had decided the acceptance of the Dock Statement, but in

this case, we find the non-consideration violates the right of the Appellant.

After carefully considering the Submissions, Evidence and the Judgment we are of the

view that the conviction cannot be accepted, therefore we find that the case against

the appellant is not proved beyond reasonable doubt, hence we uphold the grounds

of appeal and find the accused appellant not guilty. Appeal allowed and the accused

appellant is acquitted.

Appeal Allowed.
