Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus

compelling the 1st respondent Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and

Development Corporation (and its Chairman and General Manager)

to allocate the petitioner the land depicted in Plan 359 marked

P3A, and a writ of prohibition prohibiting the 1st respondent to

allocate it to anybody else other than the petitioner. The 1st

respondent objects even notice being issued on the respondents.

Hence this order.

The petitioner's case is predicated on the newspaper advertisement

marked P3 published by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

(BOI) in association with the 1st respondent inviting interested

private sector investors to submit proposals to invest and develop a

land in extent 4A 1R 37.64P at Kirimandala Mawatha, Narahenpita

for housing or mixed development project. The said land, in the

advertisement, has not been identified by way of a Plan. The

petitioner submits Plan No. 359 marked P3A as the land referred

to in the advertisement, which is denied by the respondent. This

denial is prima facie justifiable as the extent of the land in the

advertisement is 4A 1R 37.64P whereas the extent of the land in

Plan P3A is 6 acres. According to the respondent the land referred

to in the advertisement is a different land.

However there is no proof that the petitioner responded to the said

advertisement.

More than 6 months after the said advertisement, the petitioner

has submitted an application dated 16.07.2007 to the BOI seeking

an approval to set up a hospital at a property situated at Kinsey

3

Road, Colombo 7 (P4), and this has been approved by the BOI on

the same day (i.e. 16.07.2007) subject to conditions (P4A).

More than one year after this approval to set up a hospital at a

property situated at Kinsey Road, Colombo 7, the BOI has written

to the 1st respondent by P5 stating that Now the company (the

petitioner) has informed us that they have identified another 06 acre

land at Kirimandalamawatha, Nawala, depicted in Plan No. 339,

which belongs to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development

Corporation (the 1st respondent). We shall be thankful if you could

inform us as to whether the proposed land could be allocated for the

above project enabling us to consider this application for the

approval of the BOI.

This goes to show that the petitioner has not been actuated by the

advertisement but on a second thought attempted to shift the

location to set up the hospital from Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 to

another 6 acre land at Kirimandala Mawatha, Nawala depicted in

Plan No.339 (not even Kirimandala Mawatha, Narahenpita depicted

in Plan No.359).

P5 has been replied by P6 stating that the 1st respondent Sri

Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation is agreeable

to lease out the necessary land subject to approval by the Cabinet

Sub Committee on Investment Facilitation (CSIF) and other

necessary approvals. You (BOI) may submit this to CSIF and obtain

the necessary approval.

According to P6, it is the responsibility of the BOI (and not the 1st

respondent) to obtain the approval from the Cabinet Sub

Committee on Investment Facilitation. This has not been obtained

by the BOI on behalf of the petitioner.

4

Thereafter the BOI has written P8 to remind the petitioner that We

refer to the Letter of Approval dated 16th July 2007 issued to you on

the above subject (Project to set up a Hospital) and noted that you

have not taken any action as yet to enter into the Agreement with

the BOI. It is noteworthy that this Approval dated 16.07.2007 is

in relation to the land at Colombo 7 and not at Kirimandala

Mawatha, Narahenpita.

P9 is a letter sent by the 1st respondent to the petitioner stating

inter alia that As instructed by the Secretary, Ministry of Urban

Development and Sacred Area Development, we may consider the

allocation of land referred therein subject to necessary approvals.

Further it states However a case may take up before the Court of

Appeal with regard to the subject property therefore this

consideration is subject to the decision of the court and

establishment of the ownership.

Thereafter the Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development and

Sacred Area Development has informed the petitioner by P10 that

they have decided to allocate the land depicted in Plan P3A to the

petitioner to set up a hospital, and further stated that The above

land partly belongs to REDECO, which is a subsidiary of Sri Lanka

Land Reclamation & Development Corporation which comes under

the purview of this Minisrty and ownership of other part is presently

in dispute and the matter is now pending in the Appeal Court.

About 6 months after the said letter the 1st respondent has by P11

informed the petitioner that the allocation of the land is subject to

the following conditions: 1. Legal clearance and revesting of part of

the land 2. Necessary approvals from relevant institutions such as

BOI, UDA and the Cabinet of Ministers 3. The payment of relocation

5

cost 4. Payment of Chief Valuers valuation for the land 5. Any other

terms and conditions prevailing at the time of allocation.

Thereafter by letter P12 dated 26.11.2009 the Chairman of the 1st

respondent has informed the petitioner to deposit Rs.5 million as

the confirmation fee, and on the following day, i.e. on 27.11.2009

the Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Area

Development has by P13 informed the petitioner that H.E. the

President has prohibited state owned property alienation or transfer

to any part during the election period. In view if the above, please

treat the Chairmans letter as withdrawn. With P13 the matter

shall end.

About three years after P13, the petitioner has again agitated the

matter and again written to the BOI, Secretary to the new Ministry,

i.e. Ministry of Investment & Promotion, under which 1st

respondent Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Development Corporation

comes, and the new Chairman of the 1st respondent Corporation

(vide P14-P22).

The new Chairman of the 1st respondent Corporation by P18 has

informed the BOI that the land identified by the investor is a part

of the lands acquired under Grater Colombo Flood Control and

Environmental Improvement Project for Water Retention Purposes.

This reason has been disputed by the Chairman of the BOI by P21

and requested the 1st respondent to release the land to the

petitioner to set up a hospital.

It is thereafter the petitioner has sent P22 to the 1st respondent

demanding to take steps to release the land within one week from

the date of that letter, and filed this application.

It is elementary that the petitioner must show that he has a legal

right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom

mandamus is sought. (Mageswaran v. University Grants

Commission1, Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal

Education2, Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd v. UDA3, Credit Information

Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferriee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd4) The

petitioner manifestly fails in this requirement.

However it is the submission of the petitioner that the petitioner

has a legitimate expectation in view of the representations made by

the 1st respondent that the land would be conveyed to it. By

looking at the correspondence referred to above I do not think that

the 1st respondent Corporation taken in isolation gave such

promises.

Assuming without conceding that the petitioner has a legitimate

expectation, can this Court, in the facts and circumstances of this

case, issue a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st respondent to

convey the land depicted in Plan P3A to the petitioner? The

answer shall in my view be negative.

Mandamus cannot be issued when major facts are in dispute.

(Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board5, Dr. Puvanendran v. Premasiri6,

Wijenayake v. Minister of Public Administration7) There is a dispute

regarding identification of the land advertised by P3. Even though

the petitioner says that any doubt was cleared by subsequent

correspondence, it is not so. For instance, according to the

1 [2003] 2 Sri LR 282 2 [2007] 2 Sri LR 281 3 [2008] 2 Sri LR 302 4 [2005] 1 Sri LR 89 5 [1981] 2 Sri LR 471 6 [2009] 2 Sri LR 107 7 [2011] 2 Sri LR 247

7

minutes of one-stop-shop meeting on BOI projects dated

01.11.2012 (annexure to P18), it is stated that Representative of

SLLRDC (the 1st respondent) stated the land referred to by the

investor was not advertised to be allocated for any project.

Even if it is to be considered as the land depicted in Plan 359,

according to P10, the land does not belong to the 1st respondent.

It partly belongs to REDECO, a subsidiary of the 1st respondent

(and not to the 1st respondent), and the ownership of the other part

is presently in dispute and the matter is pending in this Court. In

that backdrop how can the Court issue a mandamus compelling

the 1st respondent to convey the land to the petitioner?

Mandamus will not be issued where the respondent has no power

to perform the act sought to be mandated. (Kumarasinghe v.

Dayananda Dissanayake8) Nor will it be issued when it appears

that it is impossible of performance by reason of the circumstances.

(Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education9)

In any event, the decision to allocate the land, according to P11,

has been taken subject to a number of conditions including

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. These conditions have not

been fully satisfied and approvals have not been obtained.

Mandamus cannot be issued subject to fulfilling of conditions.

"Mandamus will not be granted to compel the performance of some

duty which may arise in the future. There must be an existing duty,

and an existing right in the petitioner to have it performed."

I refuse to issue notice and the application of the petitioner is

dismissed with costs.
