the 4th Respondent should not be punished for committing the offence of contempt

of court or in the alternative to, adopt such other procedure as the court may deem

fit, to deal with the 3rd Respondent in respect of the offence of contempt of court.

As alleged by the Petitioner, the said relief is based on "deception of court"

by the 4th Respondent with false statements of facts stated in case bearing No.

CAlWRl255/2017.

In paragraph 4 of the Petition, the Petitioner states that Application bearing

No. CAl WRI 255/2017, "filed by the 4th Respondent contained complete

falsehood to mislead the court and such false statements contained therein

amounts to a deliberate suppression of material facts" presented to court by the

petitioner in case bearing No. CA/WRl21S120 15.

Case bearing No. CAlWRl215 2015, was filed by the same Petitioner, inter

alia, seeking a writ of Prohibition against the 3rd Respondent (Saman Silva,

Deputy Director of Customs) prohibiting him from conducting the customs inquiry

CIB/INV 132/2013, and to compel the I st Respondent (Director General of

Customs) to appoint an independent inquiring officer to conduct the said inquiry.

The said writ application, 215/2015, is yet to be supported for notice on the

Respondents. The 4th Respondent to this application is Heinz Adolf Reuter,

ChairmanlManaging Director, Mis Prestige Automobiles (pvt) Ltd. Presently there

is an application before court to amend the said Petition and the caption subject to

the objections raised by the Respondents, for determination.

4

Petition bearing No. CA/255/2017, was filed by Mis Prestige Automobile

(pvt) Ltd. Under Article 140 of the Constitution, invoking the Writ jurisdiction of

this court to impugn the order in the customs inquiry bearing No.

CIB/INV/32/2013,

In paragraph 35 to the Petition the Petitioner states,

"that the evidence presented in court in CAIWRl215120 17 dated 27th June

2017, that are reproduced in this contempt petition clearly point to the fact

that the sole objective of initiating the writ application No. Writl25512017

is manifestly fraudulent with ulterior motives. "

At present the petitioner has filed papers to intervene in CA application No.

255/2017, which is pending determination, a fact, the 4th Respondent submits, has

been suppressed to court by the petitioner.

We note the written submissions filed by the 4th Respondent, where the 4th

Respondent has reproduced and answered each of the allegations contained in the

petition, inter alia, it is stated that,

l. the 4th Respondent named III the contempt application IS not the

petitioner in CA/Writ/255/20 17

2. the facts and legal grounds upon which case bearing No.

CA/Writ/255/20 17 was presented are matters necessarily to be decided

at the hearing into that application which is pending determination.

As pointed out earlier, the petitioner in Writ application No. 255/2017, is

MIS Prestige Automobiles (pvt) Ltd. Therefore the 4th Respondent (Heinz Adolf

Reuter) as an independent legal entity has not initiated the said writ application

215/2017, nor has the 4th Respondent a party to the said proceedings. Accordingly,

there is no legal or factual basis where the court can issue a rule on the 4th

Respondent to show cause as to "why it should not be punished for committing the

offence of contempt of the court of appeal". The alternate relief prayed for in the

said prayer calling to "adopt some other procedure as the court may deem fit to

deal with the 3rd Respondent in respect of the offence of contempt of court" is

unfounded and misconceived in law.

At present this court has not arrived at a finding in Writ application No.

215/2017, which is yet to be supported for notice on the Respondents. However,

the petitioner relies on the facts pleaded in the said case to demonstrate and

establish the alleged ulterior motives and the fraudulent manifestation of the 4th

Respondent in initiating the writ application No. 255/2017. II

The law and facts contained in petition CA writ application No. 255/2017

are pending deliberation before this court on its merits. We are mindful that the

petitioner has made an application for intervention in the said Writ application No.

255/2017, and that writ application No. 215/2017 is pending support of

application. A deliberate suppression or misrepresentation of facts as alleged by

the petitioner, or an interference or a perversion of the due administration of

I I 1 ! ,

. ' 6

justice, are in the above circumstances, grounds of deliberation in the respective

judicial review applications pending before this court. Therefore, we find that the

petitioners application for contempt of court in respect of matters pending

determination is erroneous.

In the circumstances, we are of the VIew that this application is

misconceived in law and the petitioner has failed to disclose the perpetration of

contempt of court by the 3rd or the 4th Respondents.

Accordingly, we refuse the issuance of notice on the Respondents and

dismiss this application in limine.
