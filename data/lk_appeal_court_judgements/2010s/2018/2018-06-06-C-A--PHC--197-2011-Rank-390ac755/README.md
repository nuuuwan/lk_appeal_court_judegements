JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena J

5

The 2nd Respondent had held an inquiry pursuant to a complaint made by

the Appellant and his father that the 6th Respondent had transferred the

title of the paddy land to a third party without first offering the said paddy

land for sale to them. After the said inquiry the 2nd Respondent had

concluded that the said transfer of title is contrary to section 2 (1) of the

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the

_ Act). Therefore, the 2nd Respondent had declared that the relevant deed of

transfer to be invalid.

The relevant inquiry proceedings have been produced marked P 8 and the

relevant decision is contained in the document produced marked P 13 and

P 15.

It is clear that the above decisions have been made by the 2nd Respondent

on the basis that the said paddy land was not offered for sale to the tenant

cultivator of the said paddy land who is the father of the Appellant. It is on

that basis that the 2nd Respondent had declared the relevant deed of

transfer invalid.

It is a fact that the Appellant's father had passed away on 2009-07-26. It is

to be noted that the r h Respondent had transferred the title of the said

6

paddy land back to the 6th Respondent by deed of transfer No. 4370

attested by M. F. M. Azmi Notary Public on 2009-09-01. Thereafter, the 6th

Respondent had again transferred the title of the said paddy land to the 7th

Respondent by deed of transfer bearing No. 4377 attested by M. F. M.

Azmi Notary Public on 2009-09-02. This is after the demise of the father of

the Appellant.

Perusal of the material adduced in this case shows clearly that the

Appellant has failed to establish that he was the lawful tenant cultivator of

the relevant paddy land.

The Appellant in his Petition1 filed in the Provincial High Court, had . admitted that he had been informed that he could not be declared as the

tenant cultivator of the said paddy land in view of the objections raised by

the landlord. The Appellant has not challenged that decision.

It is a fact that the deed, which was declared invalid by the 2nd

Respondent, in the present circumstances, does not have any effect on the

tittle of the said paddy land held by the ]th Respondent. The title of this

paddy land had been transferred to the 7th Respondent by a subsequent

1 Paragraph 24 of the petition.

7

deed of transfer attested after the demise of the lawful tenant cultivator.

Since the Appellant is not the lawful tenant cultivator, he cannot claim any

right to this paddy land. Therefore, the order dated 2011-08-04

pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge is a correct order.

In these circumstances, this Court is satisfied that its intervention is not

required at this stage. Thus, this Court affirms the judgment of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge dated 2011-08-04 and proceed to dismiss this

appeal with costs.
