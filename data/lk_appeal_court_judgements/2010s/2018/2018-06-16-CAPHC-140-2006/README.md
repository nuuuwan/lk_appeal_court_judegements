ACHALA WENGAPPULI, I.

This is an appeal filed by the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 1/ Appellant") against the order of the

Provincial High Court, holden in Anuradhapura, delivered on 08.05.2006

allowing an application by the Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") to revise an order of

Kekirawa Magistrate's Court in case No. 17720, delivered on 18.06.2004.

The Respondent made an application to Kekirawa Magistrate's

Court for the eviction of the Appellant from the State land described in its

schedule, under Section 5(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act No.7 of 1979 as amended (hereinafter referred to as the 1/ Act"). After

an inquiry, the Magistrate's Court has made order dismissing the

application of the Respondent on the basis that the Appellant has satisfied

the Court that the annual permit issued to him has not been cancelled or

revoked.

In view of the dismissal of his application, the Respondent has

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court to set

aside the said order of dismissal. After an inquiry into the revision

application, the Provincial High Court made the impugned order setting

aside the order of dismissal made by Kekirawa Magistrate's Court.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Provincial High Court, the

Appellant sought intervention of this Court to set it aside.

3

The appeal of the Appellant was initially rejected by this Court for

non-payment of brief fees. Then the Appellant satisfied this Court that he

was not served with a notice and his appeal was accordingly restored to

the roll on 11.11.2013.

At the hearing of this appeal on 15.05.2018, the parties invited this

Court to pronounce judgment on the written submissions. The Appellant

has tendered written submissions, initially on 11.01.2017 and by way of a

motion, further written submissions on 30-05-2018.

In support of his appeal, the Appellant submits that the Provincial

High Court was in error when it failed to consider the following;

a. the permit became cancelled only in relation to a part of the State

land and not in its entirety,

b. no extent of land given in the quit notice,

c. the permit was not revoked or rendered invalid otherwise,

d. the Appellant was not given notice of the cancellation of permit

or that it would not be renewed,

e. the Respondent acted in violation of the Appellant's "legitimate

expectation" of a long-term permit.

These grounds, relied upon by the Appellant in support of his

appeal, are based on the question of legal validity of the course of action

taken by the Respondent before making his application to Kekirawa

Magistrate's Court.

It is evident from the perusal of the provisions contained in the said

Act, the starting point of any action by the Respondent under its

provisions, is with a formation of an opinion. Section 3(1)(a) and (b), 4

enables a Competent Authority to form an opinion in relation to two

aspects. Firstly, he must form an opinion that the land in question is a State

land. Secondly, he must form an opinion that the person in possession of

such State land is in unauthorised occupation. If he could form opinion on

these two aspects, then the law provides for the next step in the recovery of

possession of the State land.

Having formed opinion, the Competent Authority then could issue

a quit notice on such unauthorised occupier. If the unauthorised occupier

fails to deliver vacant possession by the stipulated date, then the

Competent Authority is empowered to seek judicial intervention to

recover possession by making an application for an order of eviction.

The Competent Authority need not establish that the land in

question is a State land and the person is in unauthorised occupation as

per provisions of Section 9(2) of the Act, apart from affirming it in his

affidavit to Court that it is so.

In Farook v Gunewardene, Government Agent, Apmarai (1980) 2 Sri

L.R. 243, this Court has held that:

"the structure of the Act would also make it appear that where the

Competent Authority had formed the opinion that any land is State

land, even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion."

Then the only option available for a person, who is in unauthorised

possession of a State land in the opinion of the Competent Authority, is to

satisfy Court in an inquiry conducted under Section 8 of the said Act that

he is in possession of State land upon a "permit or authority in force and

5

not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid". The scope of such inquiry is

limited by Section 9(1) to the following, as decided by this Court in

C.A.jPHC/41/2010 - C.A. Minutes of 31.01.2017;

"Under section 9 of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act the scope of the inquiry is limited to for

the person noticed to establish that he is not in

unauthorised occupation or possession by establishing

that;

1. Occupying the land on a permit or a written authority.

2. It must be a valid permit or a written authority.

3. It must be in force at the time of presenting it into Court.

4. It must have been issued in accordance with

any written law."

Therefore, unless the person who is in possession of the State land,

establishes all of the above, the Magistrate's Court has no option but to

allow the application by the Competent Authority.

In the instant appeal, the learned Magistrate has clearly applied the

relevant legal principles. Unfortunately, the learned Magistrate has fallen

into error when he considered the fact that the Appellant has satisfied him

that the annual permit issued to the Appellant has not been revoked or

rendered invalid by the Respondent. This conclusion conflicts with the

opinion of the Competent Authority. In other words, learned Magistrate

concluded that the Competent Authority has not revoked the annual

permit by issuance of notice of cancellation of the annual permit on the

Appellant. In arriving at this conclusion, learned Magistrate relied on

6

Regulation 214(14) of the '&le)@) t5)J~c.'} e5o@esJc.'}. This is not what the law

expects.

Section 9(1) of the Act clearly laid down the scope of an inquiry and

the judgments pronounced by superior Court have established binding

precedents with clear exposition of the applicable principles of law to a

given situation. The Section 9(1) imposes a duty on the person who is in

possession of State land to "establish that he is in possession or occupation

of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State ...

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid".

The permit issued by the Respondent on 01.06.1994 is subject to the

conditions that, unless the permit is renewed at the discretion of the

Government Agent, its validity should cease after 31.12.1994.

The Learned Magistrate's conclusion is therefore clearly erroneous

as the Appellant has only established that he was issued with an annual

permit initially. But the learned Magistrate failed to appreciate the fact that

the Appellant did not establish" ... such permit or authority is in force and

not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid". This is a positive obligation

imposed on the Appellant by clear statutory provisions and proof of its

negative, that there was no notice of cancellation of his permit by the

Competent Authority would not suffice to establish the fact that" .,. such

permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid". This burden always lies with the Appellant.

7

This position is clearly enunciated by Grero J in Muhandiram v

Chairman, JEDB(1992) 1 Sri L.R. 110, where it was held thus;

"unless the respondent-petitioner had established before the

learned Magistrate that he was in occupation of the land

stated in the schedule to the application on a valid permit or

other written authority of the State, he cannot continue to

occupy the said land and in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, the Magistrate

has to make an order directing the respondent-petitioner and

his dependents to be ejected from the land."

In view of the forgoing reasons, this Court concurs with the

determination of the Provincial High Court. Therefore, the appeal of the

Appellant is clearly devoid any merit and accordingly it ought to be

dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
