ARGUED AND

DECIDED ON:

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J. and

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

M.A. Sumanthiran Attorney-at-Law with V. Arulanantham

instructed by Sinnadurai Sundaralingam and Balendra for the

Petitioner

Chaya Sri Nammuni SC for the 1st to 3rd Respondents

18.01.2017

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ. J.

This Court has heard both Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran for the Petitioner and Ms.

Chaya Sri Nammuni State Counsel for the Respondents. By a notice marked P18,

the petitioner company was summoned for an inquiry in relation to a complaint

made by the 4th respondent on 18.09.2010. Upon a perusal of the proceedings

;

that have been furnished before this Court, it appears that the notices recite

Section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act. Section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act is

quite emphatic that the Comniis~ioner has '~to hold all such inquiries as are

necessary to determine whether an industrial dispute exists or not. In the

objections flled before this Court the State has furnished the notes of inquiry that

took place before the Commissioner General of Labour. In the recommendation

that has been made by the statutory functionary which is briefed to us as lR6, a

determination has been made on the question of EPF and the petitioner has been

1

, , '"

ordered to make a payment in relation to the employee in question namely the 4th

Respondent. This document lR6 refers to proceedings that took place on

26.01.2011. In the aforesaid recommendation that has been marked as lR6, the

inquiring officer who conducted the inquiry on behalf of the Commissioner

General of Labour refers to oral evidence and other documents that he had taken

into account. The learned State Counsel also points out that this inquiry

conducted by the inquiring officer had a witness from the employer-company (the

petitioner) being present before the inquiry. The learned State Counsel relies upo:p.

P10- the written submissions that were filed on behalf of the employer. However,

the written submissions filed on behalf of the employer-company makes serious

allegations of procedural impropriety that was inherent in the proceedings dated

26.01.2011such as bad faith, bias, and the partisan and aggressive manner in

which the inquiry had been conducted has also been alluded to. In other words

the complaint of the petitioner company is that even though it was represented at

the inquiry, it was not afforded a fair hearing at the inquiry held on 26.01.2011.

In the teeth of these allegations it becomes imperative that the proceedings dated

26.01.2011 should have been made available to this Court. It has to be noted that

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents (the officers of the Department of Labour) have

failed to furnish the proceedings relevant to the date, on which the partisan

0 _ -.'-'':. 0'-~ ~ "

~9uiry, as the petitioner avers, took place. In this con.text this Court bears in

mind the observations of Justice Senanayake in the Court of Appeal in Unique

Gemstones v Karunadasa. 1 Emphasising that the rules of natural justice

requires that reasons be provided, Justice Senanayake observed:

1(1995) 2 Sri.LR 357 (CA)

2

__ .__ ~ ____ d '. .

"The action of the Public Officers should be 'transparent' and they cannot

make blank orders. The giving of reasons is one of the fundamentals of good

administration ..... it is implicit in the requirement of the fair hearing to gi,ve

reasons for a decision. The standard (sic) offairness are not immutable."2

Transparency of proceedings manifests elements of due process and I have to

observe that even when judicial review commenced before this Court, the

proceedings dated 26.01.2011 were not available for this Court to determine that

the ground of invalidity that -was ar:gued cUd not ~xist. ._ _

--;:- -~. ~~ . In the cfftUm~taJ:.1ces, this Court holds that the grounds urged by the petitioner

that the recommendation dated 04.05.2011 (lR6) is tainted with procedural

impropriety has to be accepted.

Therefore, this Court proceeds to issue a mandate in nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the letter dated 12.10.2011 (P2) that imposed the liability on the

petitioner.
