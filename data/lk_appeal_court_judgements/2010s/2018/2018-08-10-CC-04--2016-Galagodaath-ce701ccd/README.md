JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned Magistrate of Homagama has forwarded to this court, his letter

dated 2016-03-18, along with the proceedings had before him in the case

bearing No. MC Homagama 40042, to enable this court to invoke the

jurisdiction vested in it by Article 105 (3) of the Constitution.

This Court having noticed Han. Attorney General, had this case mentioned

before this court several times taking necessary steps as precursors to the

exercise of its jurisdiction under the said Article.

Han. Attorney General having considered the material pertaining to this

case, has forwarded to this court copies of summons and charge sheet to

be served on the Accused Respondent (who will hereinafter be called and

referred to as the Accused).

When the Accused appeared before this Court in response to the said

summons, the charge sheet was handed over to him on 2016-08-10. It

, ,

3

was thereafter that learned President's Counsel who appeared for him

stated to Court that he would raise a preliminary objection before the

Accused pleads to the charges.

This Court pursuant to the above application took steps to consider the

said objections and took steps to address the concerns of the learned

President's Counsel who appeared for the Accused.

Subsequently, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has filed a set

of amended charges, which was served on the Accused Respondent.

After this Court overruled the preliminary objection raised by the learned

President's Counsel for the Accused, the charges were read over and

explained to the Accused.

It would be prudent at the commencement of this judgment, to set out

the charges levelled against the Accused before this court.

The charges framed against the accused (as they appear in the original

charge sheet in Sinhala language) are as follows;

~-he English translation of the said charges would be to the following

effect.

1) that he, on or about 2016-01-25, at the Magistrate's Court of

Homagama, without having any lawful connection to, or without

being any party to any proceedings before that Court, deliberately

and intentionally addressed the Court without obtaining any

permission thereto, and obstructed the proceedings in Court,

challenged the authority of Court, disrespected the authority of

Court, and conducted himself in a manner prejudicial to the power

and authority of Court to adnlinister justice and thereby committed

an offence of contempt punishable under Article 105 of the

Constitution.

2) that he at the place, time and in the course of the same transaction

referred to in the 1 st count above, obstructed the proceedings in

Court, challenged the authority of Courtr disrespected the authority

of Court, and conducted himself in a manner prejudicial to the

power and authority of Court to administer justice by deliberately

and intentionally stating, vvithout obtaining any permission, in

open Court, that he would not accept the orders of the Court, and

that the law of the country should not be followed, and thereby

7

committed an offence punishable under Article 105 of the

Constitution.

3) that he at the place, the time and in the course of the same

transaction referred to in the 1st count above, obstructed the

proceedings in Court, challenged the authority of Court,

disrespected the authority of Court, and conducted himself in a

manner prejudicial to the power and authority of Court to

administer justice, by deliberately and intentionally stating, without

any lawful permission, in open Court, in the form of a direction,

that the Court must grant bail to the suspects in the case No. B

7417/10 and thereby committed an offence punishable under Article

105 of the Constitution.

4) that he, at the place, the time and in the course of the same

transaction referred to in the 1 st count above, challenged the

authority of Court, disrespected and degraded the authority of

Court, and conducted himself in a manner prejudicial to the power

and authority of Court to adrninister justice by deliberately and

intentionally, with0ut any lawful pernlission, addressing in open

Court, the Senior State Counsel who appeared for the prosecution

Mr. Dileepa Pieris, as an impotent state officer ("~goe325) 6Jej)S

8

mcC::hB05:/' ), and insulted him and thereby committed an offence

punishable under Article 105 of the Constitution.

The Accused pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Thereafter, learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General (who Vvill hereinafter be called and

referred to as the SDSG) led the evidence of four Witnesses. After the

learned SDSG closed his case, the Accused and two other witnesses gave

evidence on behalf of the Accused. With the present bench being

constituted on 2018-01-16, learned President's Counsel for the Accused

moved for time to consider whether he would object to adoption of

evidence led before the previous bench. Having considered the said issue,

learned President's Counsel thereafter did not raise any objection for the

present bench continuing with the evidence already led. Both the learned

SDSG and the President's Counsel for the Accused thereafter addressed

this court setting out their respective cases and then each one of them

filed written submissions also.

As the proceeding in the instant case revolves around the above charges

for which penal sanctions are attracted, this Court at the outset presumed

that the Accused is not guilty to the above charges. It is in that backdrop

that this Court heard the evidence led before it.

'.

9

~

This Court is mindful that it ought to consider the evidence led before it in

its totality, taken as a whole. However, for convenience and for easy

future reference to the readers of this judgment, this Court would set out

the evidence of several witnesses in the following manner. This Court for

the purposes of clarity thinks it fit to state here, that by adopting the

following style of dealing with each witness's evidence, it did not intend by

any means to compartmentalize the evidence led before it.

Witness No. 01

Evidence of Ranga Srinath Abeywickrema Dissanayake -

(Magistrate)

This witness was the presiding Magistrate in the Magistrate's Court of

Homagama when the incident relevant to the instant proceedings took

place in the said Court. Summary of his evidence (in pOint form) pertaining

to the incident relevant to this case would be as follows;

1. The case No. B 7417/2010 is a case in vvhich tl-Ie Criminal

Investigations Department has reported facts against some suspects

alleging that they are suspected to have cornmitted an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

10

.... .... .,. 11. It was Senior State Counsel Dileepa Pieris who appeared (most of the

ti me) for the prosecution.

III. Even on the date of the incident (Le. 2016-01-25), Senior State Counsel

Dileepa Pieris appeared in Court for the prosecution.

IV. The ~~agistrate had spent about 1 i/2 - 2 hours to deal with the matters

arose in the case in Court on that date.

V. He had observed that a group of Buddhist monks (about 10 in number)

seated (on the benches allocated to public) in Court throughout that

time.

VI. He had thereafter made ordert further remanding the suspects and

finished the dayls proceedings relevant to that case and just

commenced dealing with the next case in the roll in open Court.

VII. The Accused at that time suddenly got up, came right in front of him

(bench), and started addressing him while standing there.

VIII. Some of the statements the Accused had made are as follows;

IX. Having being surprised and flabbergasted by the sudden and

unexpected conduct of the Accused, the !'v1agistrate had warned him

through the Interpreter of Court directing hirn to take care to behave in

11

a proper manner suitable to Court since he was obstructing the

proceedings in Court.

X. He had heard some in the Courtroom passing remarks as to why he

does not take a prompt action to take the Accused into custody and put

him in the cell of the Court.

XI. He warned the Accused through the interpreter to behave in a proper

manner because the said address by the Accused is totally

unwarranted, made without any permission of Court, obstructed the

proceedings of Court, and aimed at challenging the authority of Court.

XII. Despite the warnings, the Accused continued his address. It was at that

time Senior State Counsel Dileepa Pieris came quickly to open Court. At

the same time, Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney at Law who had

appeared for the aggrieved party of the relevant case also came along

with him.

XIII. It was at that time, the Senior State Counsel (Mr. Dileepa Pieris)

started addressing Court and requested the Magistrate to take

irnmediate action against the Accused as he is obstructing the

proceedings in Court.

XIV. The Accused became more aggressive with the submission of Senior

State Counsel Dileepa Pieris and told" ... 18u 6@ c5d0c.J

12

Thereafter, the Accused had left open Court saying" ... ~~a:6l~J0'c0

XV. He thereafter having recorded what transpired in Court, made an order

directing the Head Quarters Inspector of Police - Homagama, to arrest

and produce the Accused.

XVI. Since he had taken the view that the Accused had committed a very

serious offence of contempt of Court, he had decided to refer this

matter to the Court of Appeal, as the punishment he could have meted

out to the Accused for that offence is not a punishment that would be

appropriate to the conduct of the Accused.

The hand written notes of the said occurrence made by the Magistrate's

hand writing (case No. 40042/16) was produced marked "7 1. The typed

proceedings pertaining to the same journal entry was produced marked

"7 2.

Cross-examination

In the course of the cross examination of this '''Jitness, the following main

pOints have been relied upon by the learned President's Counsel for the

Accused.

1) The Accused was standing when he addressed Court.

13

2) The Accused used the word " ... dDJ@zR ... " when addressing

Court.

3) Presence of certain differences between the narration of events

by this witness in his evidence and the notes entered by him in

the case record.

Learned President's Counsel appearing for the Accused had put forward

following suggestions to this witness.

I. That this witness did not take any steps to arrest the Accused at that

time itself because the Accused had not committed such a serious

act which would have warranted this witness to make an order to

arrest him.

II. That the steps were taken to arrest the Accused subsequently and

refer this matter to the Court of Appeal as a result of a request by

another group who was present in Court at that time.

III. What this witness had recorded on 2016-03-18 at a time after more

than one month, relates to factual positions, which did not take

place on the date of this incident.

IV. That this witness was prompted to insert inCidents, which actually

did not take place upon a request made by some lawyers and others

later on.

~. ~

14

V. That it was Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney-At-Law who was

interested in getting the Accused arrested.

VI. That this witness consented and agreed to listen to what the

Accused wanted to say and it is because of that permission that the

Accused spoke in Court.

This witness has categorically refused to accept these suggestions.

Section 795 of the Civil Procedure Code states that the minute of the facts

observed and recorded by the judge before whom the accused person's

contemptuous behavior and use of language took place, shall be

admissible as evidence at the hearing of the charge. This witness being

the Magistrate of that Court before whom the relevant incident had

occurred, had at the first instance recorded the incident in his own

handwriting. Thereafter he had taken steps to set out the incident

occurred in more elaborated terms for the purpose of forwarding the

record to the President of the Court of Appeal for further action against

the Accused. This Court is of t:,e view that there is nothing unusual in this

process, as any Judge facing a similar situation \Nould be obliged to follow

such process, which is somewhat similar to the process set out in section

389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. When

considering the totality of the evidence, this Court is satisfied that the

15 , ,

" suggestion made by the learned President's Counsel for the Accused to

this witness that he was prompted to record incidents which actually did

not take place, upon a request made by some lawyers and others later on,

remains a mere baseless suggestion. The said suggestion has no factual or

legal basis and hence has no value to this proceeding.

Apart from the above, this witness has clearly described the relevant

incident before this Court. His evidence was subjected to severe cross-

examination by the learned President's Counsel for the Accused. It is the

observation of this Court that the learned President's Counsel for the

Accused despite the said severe cross-examination had not been

successful in assailing the testimony of this witness.

On the other hand, this Court observes that the Accused in his evidence

had also testified to most of the facts narrated by this witness in

somewhat similar form. However, there are few items of evidence that the

Accused had not admitted.

One main feature the Accused had denied in the evidence in chief is the

fact that he addressed Senior State Counsel rVlr. Dileepa Peiris as " .. , <t8u

Z5)gOe.326J@2)-)'> ... " ....... However, when questioned further on this point by

the learned SDSG, the AcclIsed rnodified his version and stated that \Nhat

16 . '. ~

he told was some words, which meant an impotent government. The

evidence of the Accused on this point is as follows; " ... q25f25J 6iS)125J~

It is to be noted that the two witnesses called on behalf of the Accused

did not corroborate this version of the Accused. The evidence of the said

two witnesses is that the Accused never uttered the said words.

Further, this Court for the reasons set out elsewhere in this judgment has

decided that these two witnesses and the Accused have not divulged the

incident in its true form. Thus, the evidence adduced on behalf of the

defence has not created any doubt regarding the credibility of this

witness.

This Court for the reasons set out at various places in this judgment has

decided to accept the evidence of Deputy Solicitor General Mr. Dileepa

Peris and Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney at law. It is the view of this

Court that the said two witnesses have corroborated the testimony of this

witness as a truthful narration of the events. This Court has no reason to

believe that any of the suggestions made to this witness, by the learned

President's Counsel for the Accused, have any merit whatsoever, The said

suggestions have been made 'vvithout any legal or factual basis.

"-

17

4, In these circumstances, this Court does not have any difficulty in

accepting the evidence of this witness as a truthful narration of the events

upon which this Court can safely act.

Witness No. 02

Evidence of Malwattage Chamath Dileepa Peiris -

(Deputy Solicitor General).

This witness who was a Senior State Counsel at that time is the counsel

who had appeared for the prosecution representing the Hon. Attorney

General in the relevant case, which had been taken up before the

Magistrate at the relevant time.

He along with another Senior State Counsel Wasantha Perera had

appeared for the prosecution in that case on the date of the incident and

had made lengthy submissions relating to some issues pertaining to the

case before the Magistrate. The Magistrate at the end of the said

submissions, had ordered that the period of remand of the suspects be

extended. Thereafter, he along with the other Senior State Counsel Mr.

Wasantha Perera had walked out of the Courthouse. When he was waiting

outside the Court (at a place close to the Courtroom), he had heard from

18

'the direction of the Courtroom, someone speaking with a high tone. At

that time, a police officer had informed him that the Accused was

addressing the Magistrate in open Court. He had then come back to the

Court House.

He had then observed that the Magistrate was still on the bench and the

Accused was directly addressing the Magistrate. He had also observed that

Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney-at-law was also present at that time.

This witness has confirmed that the Accused had infact uttered the

statements referred to by the witness No.Ol (Magistrate).

According to this witness's evidence, he has observed that the Magistrate

had been embarrassed finding it difficult to tolerate the contents of the

speech made by the Accused and hence was in a difficult situation. This

witness has stated in his evidence that the Magistrate had told the

Accused that he (Magistrate) had listened to him (Accused) to a certain

extent because he (Accused) was a monk. The Magistrate had also told

the Accused that he is compelled to take steps against him in case he

continued with his address any further. The Accused had responded to the

above warning by the Magistrate in following terms;

...

19

" WCJ 0~25)) ~~) w8Z))25). eJ 0[)~[)O ) <tI52~ 88~ ~25)zsj d~~25)

@Z))w25))GJ)dm25) 0[)Z))25) 9~)25') .... "

At that time, this witness has also addressed Court and urged the

Magistrate to take steps against the Accused. It is at that time that the

Accused had turned to him and said " ... 2ng Oe52W de50v5 ~z3~~)

<yetm51Z5"f", " ... 0 [)0c0 d)e5 0 s1S 251cw)BZ>f, d)e5 0 s1SZ))[) 25)~We3

Upul Kumarapperuma Attornet-at-Iaw (who had appeared for the

aggrieved party in the relevant case) had also requested the Magistrate to

take stern action against the Accused. Then Mr. Upali Senarathne upon

the request by the Magistrate had stated that he could identify the

Accused as Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero. However, at that time the

Accused had gone out of the Courtroom. Therefore, the ~~agistrate had

ordered the Assistant Superintendent of Police of Homagama and the HQI,

Police station Homagama to immediately arrest the Accused and produce

him in Court.

Cross-examination

Answering the questions asked by the learned President's Counsel for the

Accused, this witness had explained the background facts pertaining to the

e.

--

20

incident relevant to the said case and the events leading to filing of the B

report of the relevant case in the Homagama Magistrate's Court.

Answering the questions asked by the learned President's Counsel about

the incidents pertaining to this proceeding, this witness has confirmed the

facts he had narrated in his examination in chief and reiterated that the

Accused had uttered the said statements before the Magistrate and that

the said statements amounted to contempt of Court.

When suggested by the learned President's Counsel for the Accused that

he was making contradictory statements, this witness had refused to

accept that suggestion. It is the position of this witness that the statement

made by the Accused to release the suspects in that case is in the form of

a direction to the Magistrate and not a request.

Learned President's Counsel appears to have pursued an argument that it

was a mere dialog between the Magistrate and the Accused. He had

placed reliance on the word "e5oDJ~(j~II. However, when considering the

evidence of this witness as a whole it is clear that he had not used that

word to indicate that it is a peaceful dialog, which indeed happened

between the Magistrate and the Accused.

Learned President's Counsel for the Accused has also unsuccessfully

attempted to show that the evidence of the witnesses called by the SDSG

21

-- are contradictory to each other. It is his submission that the Magistrate

has taken up the position that he did not offer any explanation to the

Accused when he addressed Court when the other witnesses had stated

that the Magistrate explained to the Accused that he was acting according

to law.

This witness has refused the suggestion made to him by the learned

President's Counsel that he was giving evidence with malice towards the

Accused. He has also refused the suggestion made to him by the learned

President's Counsel for the Accused, that the assertion by him that the

Accused uttered "Z5)goe52m 6e3(5\cl ~w~~:/' is a fabrication by him.

Answering further, this witness has stated that the Accused did not utter

any other obscene words other than the above statement. This witness

has confirmed that Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney-at-law had also

requested from Courts to take the Accused into custody.

Evidence of this witness was also subjected to severe cross-examination

by the learned President's Counsel who appeared on behalf of the

Accused. However, the record of evidence clearly shows that this witness

has withstood his grounds even in the face of the said severe cross-

examination. Learned President's Counsel has not been successful in

shaking any of his stances. Moreover, learned President's Counsel for the

22 ,

Accused has also not been able to highlight any discrepancy in the

evidence of this witness either per se or inter se. This Court has no reason

whatsoever to refrain from accepting and acting upon the testimony of

this witness.

The evidence of the Magistrate is fully compatible with the evidence of this

witness. They are not at variance at any point. It is the observation of this

Court that the said witnesses have mutually corroborated each other.

Further, this Court has decided to accept the evidence of Mr. Upul

Kumarapperuma Attorney-at-law for the reasons set out in this judgment

at the place where this Court has dealt with the evidence of said Mr.

Kumarapperuma. This Court observes that the evidence of all three

witnesses namely the Magistrate, the Deputy Solicitor General and Mr.

Upul Kumarapperuma are mutually corroborative of each other. Therefore,

this Court decides to accept the testimony of this witness as trustworthy

evidence upon which this Court can safely act.

Witness No. 03

Evidence of Kumarapperuma Arachchige Upul Indika

Kumarapperuma - (Attorney at law)

..

23

t. This witness is the Attorney-at-law who had appeared for the aggrieved

party in the relevant case on that date. He also has narrated the events

occurred in MC Homagama on the relevant date. His evidence is also on

the same line as those previously testified. He has confirmed the events

spoken to, by the previous witnesses. This Court does not think it should

summarize the evidence of this witness separately here, as such an

exercise would only amount to a repetition of facts already stated in this

judgment.

Cross-examination

Learned President's Counsel for the Accused had suggested to this witness

that he was giving false evidence. However, this witness has rejected that

suggestion and stated that he has no necessity to give false evidence

about this incident.

Learned president's counsel for the Accused had then inquired from this

witness about some associations in which he is an active member. In the

course of answering those questions, this witness had asserted that he is

a person who is not against Buddhism but a person who would do

anything to protect Buddhism. This witness has admitted that his name

appeared in the National List of the Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna for the

Parliamentary Elections held in the year 2015. However, nothing has

.-

24 f,

turned out from the above facts against the trustworthiness of the

testimony of this witness.

It is the position of this witness that the Accused defied the request made

by the Magistrate at the relevant occasion to stop addressing Court in a

contemptuous manner.

This witness has rejected the suggestion made to him by the learned

President's Counsel that he had discussed with Deputy Solicitor General

Dileepa Peiris, about the evidence in this case. It is the position of this

witness also that the conduct of the Accused at this occasion amounted to

a clear contempt of Court.

Learned President's Counsel cross-examined this witness at length.

However, this Court observes that this witness has stood the grounds he

had already taken despite the piercing cross-examination by the learned

President's Counsel for the Accused. This Court cannot observe any

infirmity in the evidence of this witness, which is capable of rendering his

evidence untrustworthy.

Moreover, the evidence of th is witness is on the sa me Ii ne as that of the

other witnesses namely the Magistrate and the Deputy Solicitor General.

This Court upon comparison of the evidence of each of these witnesses,

cannot find any variance or any discrepancy in their evidence at any point.

25

Thus, this Court can conveniently conclude that the evidence of this

witness has corroborated the evidence of the Magistrate and the Deputy

Solicitor General. Evidence of each of these three witnesses matches with

each other's evidence. Upon comparison, evaluation and scrutinizing

carefully the answers provided by this witness during the cross

examination, this Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the

evidence of this witness must be accepted and acted upon. Thus, this

Court decides to accept the evidence of this witness as trustworthy

evidence.

Witness No. 04

Evidence of Hapuarachchi Vidhanalage Athula Keerthi

Erathne, (Registrar, Magistrate Court, Homagama).

This witness being the Registrar of the Magistrate's Court Homagama has

produced before this Court, the case record bearing No. 8/7417/10. This

witness had not served in any capacity in the said Court at the time of the

incident relevant to this case.

Cross-examination

26

.Learned president's counsel for the Accused had produced through this

witness (during the cross-examination), the B report dated 2015-11-09

marked B 1. The learned President's Counsel for the Accused has also

produced through this witness, the detention orders marked eJ 2, B 3, B

~ B 5 and the journal entry dated 2015-11-09 marked eJ 7.

The case record of the Magistrate's Court Homagama relevant to this case

has been produced marked e.57 3.

This witness is an official witness who merely testified to some facts in his

official capacity as the current registrar of the Magistrate's Court

Homagama. The said facts emanate from the contents of the relevant

case record he produced in this Court. The learned President's Counsel for

the Accused has not challenged this witness's evidence presumably

because the evidence of this witness is limited to the production of the

relevant records.

With the evidence of above four witnesses having been led before this

Court, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General had closed his case

marking the documents e.57 1, e.57 2, e.51 3, X 1, and X 3.

Thereafter, the Accused gave evidence before this Court. Two other

witnesses namely Kirama Devinda Thero and Pitigala Dhamma Veneetha

27

" Thero, having been called by the Accused, also gave evidence before this

Court on behalf of the Accused. It is to the evidence adduced before this

Court on behalf of the Accused that this Court would now turn.

Witness No. 01 for the Defence

Evidence of the Accused

The Accused states in his evidence that he is a Buddhist monk holding a

Master's Degree from the University of Kelaniya and had worked as a

teacher for some time. Thereafter, he had been involved in various

activities, in particular, the activities pertaining to encouraging the soldiers

deployed in Northern and Eastern Provinces during the time they were

engaged in curbing terrorist activities in the country.

It is to be noted that the Accused in his evidence has admitted the

followings,

I. that he was present in Court on the date of the incident,

II. that he came to participate in the hearing of the relevant case in the

Magistrate's Court of Homagama on behalf of the intelligence

officers produced as suspects in that case,

III. that he was pleased with the manner in which the Magistrate

conducted the case on that date,

28

"" IV. that he had an expectation that the Magistrate would enlarge the

suspects on bail on that date,

V. that he got up and addressed the Magistrate in open Court.

It is his position that he was emotionally aroused when tears falling from

the eyes of one of the suspects fell on to his hand when the said suspect

bent forward to worship him on his way back to the cell. This was after

the Magistrate refused to enlarge the suspects on bail.

However, it is his position that he perceived from the body language of

the Magistrate that the Magistrate permitted him to speak and opted to

listen to his address. He denies directing any contemptuous statements to

the Senior State Counsel, to any other state officers, or to the Magistrate.

The Accused has admitted uttering the word "Z5)~Z5fe5ZAS) ct:J~~t)?d".

Cross-exa m i nation

Answering the questions asked during the cross examination, the Accused

had admitted that no person other than an Attorney-at-law could address

the judges in Court. He has reiterated that he was pleased with both the

independence of the Magistrate and the manner in which the Magistrate

conducted the proceedings on that date.

--

29

The Accused under cross examination has admitted that it is the judge

who decides whether or not to release a suspect on bail and that no one

else could do anything to influence the judge to persuade him to come to

a particular decision.

The accused had categorically stated that he was very pleased with the

manner in which the Magistrate conducted the proceedings in Court on

that date. He has also admitted that he went to Court on that day with the

expectation of an order from the Magistrate enlarging the suspects of the

relevant case on bail. However, in the face of the continuous questions

asked by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General as to why then the

Magistrate opted to give evidence before this Court incriminating him, the

Accused had failed to give any reason or offer any explanation as to how

in such circumstances the Magistrate could have wanted to incriminate

him for a charge of contempt. The Accused has categorically stated that

he has had no animosity with the Magistrate. Indeed, it is the opposite; he

was pleased with the Magistrate's conduct in Court. The Accused could not

find anything to offer as an explanation to resolve this anomalous position

he has taken up.

It is to be noted that the Accused in the course of answering the questions

during the cross examinations, had admitted making the statement" ...

The Accused in the face of the cross examination by the SDSG has

admitted that he used the word "ZDgOe5ZW".

The Accused has also categorically stated that he would not have

addressed Court if the Magistrate had opted to enlarge the relevant

suspects on bail.

It is significant that the Accused has admitted uttering the word "ZDgo~zw

ct::>~~D25f" in open Court. This significance becomes paramount because

the learned President's Counsel for the Accused in the course of cross-

examination of the witnesses called by the SDSG has already put forward

the suggestion to them that the Accused never uttered the word

"ZDgo~ZW". Further, the evidence of two witnesses who testified on behalf

of the Accused was also that the Accused never uttered the word

i 31

~ Moreover, the evidence of the Accused shows clearly that he had admitted

addressing court in high tone being emotionally aroused.

Therefore, this Court holds that the evidence of the Accused before this

Court contains items of falsehood (including that the Magistrate's evidence

included things that actually did not happen), which the Accused had

deliberately stated in his unsuccessful attempt to evade the criminal

responsibility of contempt of Court that is waiting to befall on him.

Witness No. 02 for the defence

Evidence of Kirama Devinda Thero

This witness, who was called to give evidence on behalf of the Accused, is

a Buddhist monk who had been present inside the Courtroom at the

relevant time. He has narrated the sequence of events occurred in the

Court at the relevant time.

However, it is his position that the Accused never uttered anything

contemptuous of Court. Answering the questions asked during the cross

examination, this witness had asserted that the Accused never uttered the

word " ... @@ZS) ~~~@c0 mz3cJ. @@ZS) q8 8gm25f@25f Z))l @@ 3le5J @@

his evidence that the Accused never uttered the word "~80~zm". It is also

the position of this witness that the Accused never addressed Court in

high pitch.

Cross-exam i nation

When perusing the evidence given by this witness in its totality, and when

one compares the evidence of this witness with the evidence of the other

witnesses. It can clearly be seen that this witness has not divulged the full

incident in the same way it had happened. It is a fact that this witness had

opted to suppress all the incriminating items of evidence against the

Accused. It is not difficult for this Court to come to that conclusion in view

of the fact that the Accused himself in the face of the cross examination

by the learned SDSG, had at a later occasion admitted most of those facts.

It is therefore strange that this witness had opted to deny the said items

of evidence against the Accused.

On being asked from this witness by the learned SDSG whether the

Accused uttered before the Magistrate, " ... 0'zm ~~ ~0'c0 ~z3c;). @@~ et8

has categorically stated that the Accused never made such a statement. It

has to be noted at th is stage that even the Accused in the face of the

33

tJt cross examination by the learned SDSG has admitted making this

statement.

This Court is of the view that this is not a statement, which could

generally be heard in a Courthouse before a judge. If somebody uttered

these words before a Court which was in sessions, this Court cannot see

any reason as to why those who were present there could not have

remembered whether that statement was indeed made or not. As has

been mentioned before, the Accused although attempted to suppress it at

the beginning was compelled to admit having made that statement during

the cross-examination. In these circumstances, it is the considered view of

this Court that there cannot be any justification or possibility for this

witness not to have remembered this statement being made by the

Accused.

Further, the evidence of the Accused namely " ... qZ5f25) ~Z5)I25)~ ~DDJ

that he has admitted addressing in high pitch at least at some occasions.

Therefore, the assertion of this witness that the Accused never spoke in a

high pitch also does not match with the evidence of the Accused.

34 ~

This Court has to reiterate the same position with regard to the use of the

word "25)goe5zm" in Court by the Accused. This Court has to observe that

contrary to the stance taken by this witness, the Accused in his evidence

had admitted uttering this word. Therefore, the evidence of this witness is

contradictory to the evidence of the Accused.

This Court in the above circumstances can observe that the evidence of

the Accused and the evidence of this witness stand wide apart from each

other just like two parallel lines in a rail track which would never converge.

The anomaly between them is irreconcilable. It is therefore the view of

this Court that this witness has uttered falsehood to suppress the

incriminatory items of evidence against the Accused.

Witness No. 03 for the defence

Evidence of Pitigala Dhamma Veneetha Thero

This Buddhist monk is the 3rd defence Witness called to give evidence on

behalf of the Accused. He is a monk of 39 years old who had been

ordained as a Buddhist monk at the age of 18 years. He is a graduate who

has obtained a degree in Buddhist philosophy from the University of

Kelaniya and a holder of a postgraduate degree relating to the same

---

35

" subject. This monk had also been sitting along with the Accused in the

Magistrate's Court of Homagama on the date of the incident.

It is his evidence that the Accused got up in Court after the Magistrate

refused to enlarge the suspects on bail (in the case where the group of

intelligence officers were suspects) and addressed Court. It is his evidence

that the Magistrate patiently listened to the Accused. It is the position of

this witness that he did not perceive that the Magistrate had any objection

to the address of the Accused in Court.

This witness also confirmed that the address by the Accused was directed

at obtaining bail for the suspect intelligence officers in the relevant case.

This witness states that the Magistrate attempted to explain to the

Accused about his inability to enlarge the suspects.

This witness also categorically states that the Accused asked the

Magistrate to release the suspect intelligence officers on bail and to place

the Accused in remand instead. This witness states that thereafter he

heard lawyers addressing Court against the Accused and some kind of

commotion being created in the Court.

Cross Examination

36

Answering the questions asked by the learned SDSG, this witness stated

that they went to Court on that day with the expectation that the

Magistrate would enlarge the relevant intelligence officer suspects on bail.

It is the position of this witness that the monks present there in Court

were pleased with the manner in which the Magistrate conducted the

proceedings in that case. This witness also takes up the position that the

Accused never uttered the word "~goro2/S)". He also states that at no time

he heard the Accused uttering the said word.

It is his position that he cannot remember the Accused stating that the

laws made by the foreigners must not be complied. However, on being

asked further questions, this witness admitted that such utterance, if

made in Court, would be a serious utterance and that therefore he should

have remembered if such utterance was indeed made by the Accused.

Answering further, this witness states that the Magistrate did not appear

to have any objection for the speech of the Accused in Court.

Just like the previous witness called by the defence, this witness also has

opted to supress the items of evidence that is incriminatory against the

Accused by stating that such things did not happen in Court. However, it

appears that he had not known that the Accused himself by that time, in

the face of the cross examination by the learned SDSG, had adrnltted

37

... many of those things. It is the view of this Court that such suppressions

have affected the creditworthiness of the evidence of this witness.

Therefore, this Court is not inclined to accept this witness as a truthful

witness.

Submissions of Counsel

Learned President's Counsel for the Accused has advanced two main

arguments both in his oral submissions as well as in the written

submissions filed before this Court. They are under the following heads.

i. that the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court through Article 105

(3) of the Constitution must only be exercised in respect of matters

that do not fall within section 55(1) of the Judicature Act,

ii. that the acts of the Accused even if it is true, do not amount to

contempt of Court.

At the outset, this Court observes that section 39 of the Judicature Act

states as follows.

" ......... Whenever any defendant or accused party shall have pleaded in

any action, proceeding or matter brought in any Court of First Instance

neither party shall afterwards be entitled to object to the jurisdiction of

".

38

.... such court, but such court shall be taken and held to have jurisdiction over

such action, proceeding or matter:

Provided that where it shall appear in the course of the proceedings that

the action, proceeding or matter was brought in a court having no

jurisdiction intentionally and with previous knowledge of the want of

jurisdiction of such court, the Judge shall be entitled at his discretion to

refuse to proceed further with the same, and to declare the proceedings

null and void ............ "

This Court is mindful that this section applies to the Courts of First

Instance, which have been described in section 2 of the Judicature Act.

However, one must bear in mind that this Court in this instance is not

exercising its appellate jurisdiction but one of its original jurisdiction.

Therefore, it stands to reason that any party raising an objection to the

exercise of any original jurisdiction of any Court in respect of a matter

pending before it, is required to raise such objection at the very

commencement of the case.

Moreover, this Court notes that the learned President's Counsel on behalf

of the Accused, indeed raised certain preliminary objections at the very

commencement of the case. This Court at that time considered the said

objections and decided to overrule them. The learned President's Counsel

39

~ for the Accused, at no stage during the inception of the recording of

evidence or even thereafter, and until he concluded his final submissions,

raised any concern before this Court on any basis relating to lack of

jurisdiction for this Court to hear this case. Therefore, this argument

advanced on behalf of the Accused must fail in limine.

Despite this position this Court proceeded to consider that submission and

noted that the contents of Article 105 (3) of the Constitution is wide

enough and indeed was meant to empower this Court to punish for

contempt of other Courts and tribunal without any restriction. It is to that

consideration that this Court would now refer.

It would be convenient to reproduce here Article 105 (3) of the

constitution, which is as follows.

"The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal

of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and

shall have all the powers of such court including the power to punish for

contempt of itself, whether committed in the court itself or elsewhere,

with iITlprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. The power of

the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any

other court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph 1 (c) of this

Article, whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere:

40

Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice or

affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other court,

tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itself."

Since paragraph 1 (c) has been referred to, in the body of Article 105 (3)

as mentioned above, it would be convenient to reproduce Article 105 (1)

which contained that paragraph also, at this moment.

Article 105 (1) is as follows;

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the institutions for the

administration of justice which protect, vindicate and enforce the rights of

people shall be -

(a) the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(b) the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(c) the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and such other

Courts of First Instancer tribunals or such institutions as

parliament may from time to time ordain and establish,"

The plain reading of the above Articles do not even indicate that the

legislature has intended to restrict the power it has vested in the Court of

Appeal to punish for contempt of any other Court, tribunal or institution

41

:

\. referred to in paragraph 1 (c) of Article 105 (3), whether committed in the

presence of such Court or elsewhere. It is clear that the legislature had

intended to vest the Court of Appeal with very wide powers in this regard

and did not intend that this Court should exercise that power only in

respect of matters that do not fall within section 55(1) of the Judicature

Act as submitted by the learned President's Counsel for the Accused.

The case law relied upon by the learned President's Counsel, in particular

Hendrick Appuhamy Vs. John Appuhamyl and Mansoor and another Vs.

OIC Avissawella Police and another2 are both cases in which the Court

held that when a statute has created a specific remedy it is that specific

procedure which should be followed and not the procedure set out in

common law.

This Court observes that the said cases are not cases in which provisions

in an ordinary law Vis a Vis the provisions of the Constitution came to be

in conflict. Further, no such discussion or decision regarding that issue had

been made in those cases. Hence, those cases have no application to the

matter in hand where this Court has to decide whether the power vested

1 69 N L R 29.

2 1991 (2) S L R 75.

42

~in this Court by virtue of Article 105 (3) has been restricted by the

provisions in an ordinary law namely section 55 of the Judicature Act.

The Supreme Court in the case of Atapattu and others Vs. People's Bank

and others3, having considered the issue whether the powers vested

under Article 140 of the Constitution could be diminished by a provision in

the ordinary law stated as follows;

" ..... The position is the same in regard to Article 140: the language used

is broad enough to give the Court of Appeal authority to review, even on

grounds excluded by the ouster clause.

But there is one difference between those Articles and Article 140. Article

140 (unlike Article 126) is "subject to the provisions of the Constitution".

Is that enough to reverse the position, so as to make Article 140 subject

to the written laws which Article 168(1) keeps in force? Apart from any

other consideration, if it became necessary to decide which was to prevail

- an ouster clause in an ordinary law or a Constitutional provision

conferring writ jurisdiction on a Superior Court, "subject to the provisions

of the Constitution" - I would unhesitatingly hold that the latter prevails,

because the presumption must always be in favour of a jurisdiction which

3 1997 (1) S L R 208.

43

, enhances the protection of the Rule of law, and against an ouster clause

which tends to undermine it. .... "

The Supreme Court in that case held that the phrase "subject to the

provisions of the Constitution" in Article 140 of the Constitution refers only

to contrary provisions in the Constitution itself, and does not extend to

subject Article 140 to the provisions of other written laws.

The Supreme Court in the case of Weragama V Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya4 stated as follows; "However, the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction,

because Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions "of any

law"; hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction

to be reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled

to exercise judicial power) ...... "

As has been stated by the Supreme Court in the above judgments, where

the Constitution contemplated that its provisions should be subjected to

the provisions of ordinary law it has specified it in terms such as "subject

to any law" like that appears in Article 138. However, Article 105 (3) does

not have any such reference which would subject it either to any other law

or even to the provisions of the Constitution. Thus, the jurisdiction of the

4 1984 (1) Sri. L.R. 293.

~

44

Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) is an entrenched jurisdiction. It

cannot therefore be diminished by any other provision of law. Thus, the

power that Article 105 (3) vests in this Court cannot and should not be

restricted by the provisions of the Judicature Act.

Therefore, this court rejects the said argument advanced by the learned

President's Counsel for the Accused.

It is the submissions of the learned President's Counsel for the Accused

that it must be proved that the Accused has committed either,

i. an act calculated to bring a Court or a judge of a Court into

contempt or to lower his authority or to scandalize the Court or

judge, or

ii. an act calculated to obstruct or interfere with due course of justice

for the lawful process of the Court.

It is the position of the Accused that he spoke in Court addressing the

Magistrate with the implied consent of the Magistrate. However, it is not

the position of the Magistrate both according to the record maintained by

5 Page 10 of the written submissions filed on behalf of the Accused Respondent.

.-

45

-him and according to his evidence. The other witnesses called by the

learned SDSG have corroborated the position of the Magistrate.

As has been stated before in this judgment, as per section 795 of the Civil

Procedure Code this Court is entitled to rely on the notes made by the

Magistrate in this case which have been produced before this Court

marked P 1 and P 2. Despite that, the Magistrate himself has given

evidence before this Court. The witnesses called on behalf of the Accused

have categorically stated that there is no reason whatsoever for the

Magistrate to fabricate a false case against the Accused. Indeed the

evidence of the defence witnesses is that all the Buddhist monks were

very pleased in the manner the Magistrate handled the proceedings of the

relevant case in Court on that day.

This Court has initiated the instant proceedings against the Accused

because the particular Magistrate has reported this matter to this Court

urging this Court to take action against the Accused under Article 105 (3)

of the Constitution. The notes made by the Magistrate both at the time of

the incident and thereafter, show clearly that the speech made by the

Accused is not an address made with permission of Court. The sequence

of events that followed thereafter also clearly point to that fact. The above

material do not at any stage cast even a semblance of a doubt regarding

.

46 -the fact that the Accused had addressed Court without the consent of the

Magistrate. Considering all the evidence in its totality, this Court has no

difficulty at all in concluding that the Accused had made the utterances

(referred to in the charges) in Court deliberately, on his own volition,

without any permission either expressed or implied from the Magistrate.

In the case of Re Garumunige Thiiakaratne6L the Supreme Court had held

that an intention to cause disrepute or disrespect to Court is irrelevant

because all that is required is that the publication viewed objectively is

calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due Course of justice.

Be that as it may, consideration of the evidence adduced before this Court

in its totality, shows the presence of overwhelming evidence that the

conduct of the Accused before the Magistrate had been with the deliberate

intention on his part to intimidate the Magistrate in order to obtain a

desired order. This Court would discuss this aspect in more detail in the

following paragraphs of this judgment.

Accused is not a party to the relevant proceedings. He does not have any

locus standi in Court in the relevant case or for that matter in any other

case in that Court. On his own admission, he has come to Court in support

of one party namely, the party that stood as suspects in that case. This

6 1991 lSLR 134.

47

., was in his personal capacity. He had come to Court in the expectation that

the Magistrate would pronounce an order in favour of the party he was in

support of, on that day. Thus, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that

despite not being a party in the relevant proceedings or in any other

proceedings in that Court, the Accused intentionally came and sat in the

Court in support of one party namely the suspects in that case. In other

words, the presence of the Accused is not an accidental or random but a

deliberate and a planned presence. The said presence was calculated to

somehow obtain the order desired by him, namely bail for the suspects.

This fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt as the Accused

himself had admitted that he made it clear to the Magistrate that the

Magistrate can place him in remand instead of the suspects in that case.

He had also stated that he had come prepared for that.

A prominent feature, which is not in dispute, in this case is the fact that

the Accused had stood up and addressed the Magistrate after the

Magistrate had refused to enlarge the suspects on bail. This address had

been made after the conclusion of that case with an order refusing to

enlarge the suspects on bail, and after the Magistrate had called the next

case in the role before Court. Therefore, it is clear that the proceedings

before Court in the relevant case had been concluded with the order of

48

, remand in place, when the Accused had started addressing Court to insist

that the Magistrate should reverse the order and pronounce the order,

which the Accused had desired. This Court has already held that the said

address by the Accused has been made without expressed or implied

permission of Court. The address by the Accused had been in high tone

and had contained abusive, offensive and commanding language.

It would be relevant for this Court to consider next, the purpose or the

circumstances in which the Accused had uttered those words. The

Accused himself had admitted in his evidence that he wanted the

Magistrate to somehow enlarge the suspect intelligence officers on bail.

This is even at the cost of placing the Accused in remand instead of the

relevant suspects in that case. Thus, it is clear that the end result the

Accused had attempted to achieve is to somehow force the Magistrate to

enlarge the suspects in that case on bail. This is the order he had desired.

This Court needs to reiterate at this stage also that the Magistrate had

already concluded the proceedings of that case for that day with an order

being made to place the suspects in remand. Therefore, what the Accused

had attempted through his utterances and conduct before Court is to force

the Magistrate by intimidating him, to reverse the already pronounced

order of the Court.

~. ft

49

Accused in his evidence had admitted that he is aware that only the

lawyers can make submissions in Court. Despite that knowledge, he has

chosen to stand up and make those utterances to the judge after the

pronouncement of the order, with the intention of forcing the Magistrate

to reverse the order. That is why the Accused had carefully chosen the

words ~' ... 0'@2W ~~~0'm ~z3<:6. 0'@zm q8 8gmzsf0'zsf Zt 0'@ ?53e5J 0'@

6~561Dzsf0 q1e3 C@J 0'~zsfZD". It is to be borne in mind that apart from

the evidence of witnesses called by the learned SDSG, the Accused himself

has also admitted making that statement to Court. As has been said

before, these utterances have been made by the Accused without

expressed or implied permission of Court. These words have been uttered

in a tone, which was high enough even to be heard by those waiting away

from the Courtroom.

The language used by the Accused is not one acceptable in Court. It is an

offensive language. When considering these utterances in the light of all

reasonable doubt that the Accused had intended to intimidate the

Magistrate.

When the Magistrate had warned the Accused not to obstruct the

proceedings of Court, the Accused had made the following statement to

the Magistrate;

This also shows clearly that the Accused had commanded the Magistrate

to somehow release the suspects on bail forthwith.

When the Magistrate had warned the Accused (when he was making

utterances) the other lawyers, namely the Senior State Counsel Mr.

Dileepa Peiris and Mr Upul Kumarapperuma had rushed back to open

Court. This is upon being heard that the Accused was making some

utterances in Court.

51

(, It was thereafter that the lawyers had started addressing Court in order to

strengthen the Magistrate and to persuade him to take legal action against

the Accused for such behaviour.

It is significant to note that both Senior State Counsel Mr. Dileepa Pieris

and Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma Attorney at law had rushed back to open

Court upon hearing that the Accused was making some utterances in

Court. This was with a view of assisting the Magistrate who had been in a

difficult situation at that time. Both of them were otherwise getting ready

to leave the court premises at that time as their work had become over.

It is at that stage that the Accused had referred to Mr. Dileepa Peiris as an

impotent State Counsel in abusive language and directed him to sit

It is to be born in mind that the Accused had chosen on his own volition to

abuse the Senior Sate Counsel who had volunteered to appear to assist

the Magistrate who was facing a difficult situation. Apart from that, both

Senior State Counsel Mr. Dileepa Pieris and Mr, Upul Kumarapperuma

Attorney at law were counsel who appeared in the relevant case. The sole

reason for the behaviour of the Accused at that tirne is the Magistrate's

refusal to enlarge the suspects on bail (not getting the desired order in his

favour).

.. 52

~The address of the Accused to the Magistrate was not in the form of a

plea. The address was coercive and aimed at intimidating the Magistrate

to secure bail for the suspects of that case by getting the Magistrate to

reverse the order he had earlier made. In these circumstances, it is not

difficult at all for this Court to conclude that the Accused had deliberately

made the said statement to lower the authority of the Court and to

obstruct the due course of justice taking place in Court.

In this instance also, perusal of the evidence of the Magistrate and the

other witnesses as a whole shows clearly that the Magistrate's words at

that time had been to attempt to warn the Accused and silence him at

that time itself. However, the Accused had not heeded to the warnings by

the Magistrate. He had instead proceeded to abuse the Senior State

Counsel also.

The utterances by the Accused that the laws made by foreigners must be

defied is clearly to bring the authority of Court to degrade the honour and

authority of Court and a refusal to accept the authority of Court. Whether

it is foreign made or locally made it is the prevailing law that the Courts

have to apply. The Courts will administer justice according to such law

irrespective of their genesis. Therefore the said utterance of the Accused

that the laws made by foreigners must be defied is a clear indication that

53

" any order made by Court as per such laws must also be defied. It is clear

that the said reference was to the law under which the Magistrate made

that order.

It must not be forgotten that the Accused made such utterances when the

Magistrate did not give the order desired by the Accused. This utterance

must be considered in the light of all the utterances made by the Accused.

Each utterance of the Accused must not be considered separately.

Having considered all the material before Court, this Court concludes that

the ingredients of all the charges framed against the Accused have been

proved beyond reasonable doubt. This Court therefore concludes that all

charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and that the conduct

of the Accused before the Magistrate is a contemptuous conduct, which

calls for punishment in terms of Article 105 (3) of the constitution. Thus,

this Court finds the presumption made by this Court at the inception about

the innocence of the Accused now stands rebutted beyond reasonable

doubt.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds the Accused guilty of all the

charges (1st to 4th counts) in the charge sheet. Therefore, this Court

convicts the Accused on all four counts of the charge sheet.

Sentence

Considering all the evidence in its totality, this Court has held that the

Accused had made the utterances (referred to in the charges) in Court

deliberately, on his own volition, without any permission either expressed

or implied from the Magistrate. There is overwhelming evidence before

this Court, which has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of

the Accused before the Magistrate had been with the deliberate intention

to intimidate the Magistrate in order to obtain an order he had desired.

The presence of the Accused is not an accidental or random but a

deliberate and a planned presence calculated to somehow obtain the order

desired by him, namely bail for the suspects. Accused had stood up and

addressed the Magistrate after the Magistrate had refused to enlarge the

suspects on bail and after the Magistrate had called the next case.

Both Senior State Counsel Mr. Dileepa Pieris and Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma

Attorney at law had rushed back to open Court to assist the Magistrate

who had been in a difficult situation. It was then that the Accused had

referred to Mr. Dileepa Peiris as an impotent State Counsel in abusive

language and directed him to sit thereby depriving the Magistrate of their

assistance at that difficult moment.

55

t, The Accused has not tendered any apology to Court either in the

Magistrate's Court or in this Court. Instead, he has taken a high ground

that his actions were well within law. This is despite having addressed the

Magistrate with a view to intimidate him to secure bail for the suspects of

that case. What he was trying to do was to force the Magistrate to reverse

the order he had earlier made. As has been stated before, the Accused

takes up the position that this does not amount to contempt. He appears

to be thinking that this is not even a matter for regret.

The legislature had intended to vest the Court of Appeal with wide powers

to punish for contempt of other Courts and tribunal. Thus, it is the fervent

duty of this Court to ensure that all Courts and tribunal of this country are

free from all forms of intimidations and undue influences to enable their

smooth functioning towards administering justice according to law in the

country. In these circumstances, this Court takes the contemptuous

actions by the Accused very seriously. They cannot be condoned by any

yardstick. Considering all the circumstances, this Court imposes following

sentences on the Accused;

Count 1:

Four years Rigorous Imprisonment,

Count 2:

56

Four years Rigorous Imprisonment,

Count 3:

Six years Rigorous Imprisonment,

Count 4:

Five years Rigorous Imprisonment,

This Court further directs that all the above sentences should run

concurrently.
