Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application on 08.08.2018 for revision

and/or restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside (a) the

Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura dated

22.10.2015; and (b) the Order of the learned District Judge of

Ratnapura dated 03.10.2017.

According to Article 154P to the Constitution introduced by the

13th Amendment, there shall be a High Court for each Province.

The High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of

1990, made provisions regarding the procedure to be followed in,

3

and the right to appeal to and from, such High Court, and for

matters connected therewith. By this Act, the High Courts of

the Provinces were given original criminal jurisdiction as well as

appellate jurisdiction basically against the Judgments and

Orders of the Magistrates Courts, Primary Courts and Labour

Tribunals of the relevant Provinces.

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces)

(Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, sections 5A, 5B and 5C were

introduced to the aforesaid Principal Act No. 19 of 1990. This

was done to confer appellate and revisionary jurisdiction to the

said Provincial High Courts against the Judgments and Orders

of the District Courts of the relevant Provinces. Those High

Courts, although it is a misnomer, are conveniently known as

High Courts of Civil Appeals.

After the said amendment by Act No. 54 of 2006, section 5A of

the Principal Act No.19 of 1990 (without the proviso) reads as

follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and

orders delivered and made by any District Court or a Family

Court within such Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law, which shall be committed

by any such District Court or Family Court, as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2

of 1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the

Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law

applicable to the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in

subsection (1) by the Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed

4

as including a reference to a High Court established by Article

154P of the Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved

by any judgment, decree or order of a District Court or a Family

Court, as the case may be, within a Province, may invoke the

jurisdiction referred to in that subsection, in the High Court

established for that Province:

According to section 5A(2), the procedure to be adopted in the

High Court of Civil Appeal is the same procedure which is being

adopted in the Court of Appeal.

Section 5C deals with the subject of appeals from the

Judgments and Orders of the High Court of Civil Appeal.

According to this section, there is only one direct appeal to the

Supreme Court, with leave obtained, against the Judgments and

Orders of the High Court of Civil Appeal. That section reads as

follows:

5C (1) An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from any

judgment, decree or order pronounced or entered by a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of

its jurisdiction granted by section 5A of this Act, with leave of the

Supreme Court first had and obtained. The leave requested for

shall be granted by the Supreme Court, where in its opinion the

matter involves a substantial question of law or is a matter fit for

review by such Court.

(2) The Supreme Court may exercise all or any of the powers

granted to it by paragraph (2) of Article 127 of the Constitution, in

regard to any appeal made to the Supreme Court under

subsection (1) of this section.

5

The learned counsel for the petitioner accepts that a party

cannot by way of a final appeal come before this Court against

the Judgment or Order of the High Court of Civil Appeal. But

the argument of the learned counsel is that, nevertheless, a

party can come before this Court against the Judgment or Order

of the High Court of Civil Appeal by way of revision and/or

restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

If that argument is accepted, section 5C becomes meaningless,

and the intention of the legislature will blatantly be defeated, as

any party dissatisfied with any Judgment or Order of the High

Court of Civil Appeal can come before this Court by way of

revision and/or restitutio in integrum. Then the party

dissatisfied with the Judgment or Order of the District Court will

have three appealsfirst to the High Court of Civil Appeal,

second to the Court of Appeal, and third to the Supreme Court.

That was obviously never the intention of the legislature. One of

the main objectives of setting up High Courts of Civil Appeal is

to curb laws delays in civil litigation and not to expand it.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution (without the proviso) reads as

follows:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its

appellate or original jurisdiction or by any court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes,

suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such

6

High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution

may have taken cognizance:

It is significant to note that Article 138 does not confer

unrestricted, unfettered, absolute power for revision and

restitutio in integrum on the Court of Appeal against Judgments

and Orders of the High Courts. If I may repeat, it says: The

Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction..

Any law encompasses the laws introduced by Act Nos. 19 of

1990 and 54 of 2006.

The question whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to sit

on Judgments and Orders made by the High Courts of Civil

Appeal was particularly dealt with by Justice Salam (with

Justice Rajapaksha agreeing) in the Court of Appeal case of

Stephan Gunaratne v. Thushara Indika Sampath [CA (PHC) APN

54/2013 (REV)] decided on 23.09.2013.

That is a case where the plaintiff-petitioner in a partition action

came before this Court by way of revision against the Judgment

of the High Court of Civil Appeal at Ratnapura. Dismissing the

application in limine without issuing notice, Justice Salam

stated:

The question that now arises for consideration is whether the

Court of Appeal can exercise its revisionary powers under Article

138 of the Constitution in respect of a judgment of the High Court

pronounced under the Provisions of Act No 54 of 2006 when the

proper remedy is to appeal to the Supreme Court. Appreciably,

Section 5A of Act No 54 of 2006 quite specifically states that all

relevant written laws applicable to an appeal, in the Court of

7

Appeal are applicable to the High Court as well. This undoubtedly

demonstrates beyond any iota of doubt that the scheme provided

by Act No 54 of 2006 to facilitate an appeal being heard by the

Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear transfer of jurisdiction

and in effect could be said that as far as appeals are concerned

both the High Court and the Court of Appeal rank equally and are

placed on par with each other. Arising from this statement of law,

it must be understood that if the Court of Appeal cannot act in

revision in respect of a judgment it pronounces in a civil appeal,

then it cannot sit in revision over a judgment entered by the High

Court in the exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction as well, for

both courts are to be equally ranked when they exercise civil

appellate jurisdiction.

A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in

Balaganeshan v. OIC, Police Station, Seeduwa (SC SPL/LA No.

79/2015) decided on 01.04.2016 in interpreting similar

provisions found in the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

That is a criminal case where the accused unsuccessfully

appealed to the Provincial High Court against the Judgment of

the Magistrates Court. Being dissatisfied with the Judgment of

the Provincial High Court sitting in appeal, the accused appealed

to the Court of Appeal in terms of section 138 of the

Constitution. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in limine

on the basis of want of jurisdiction. Rejecting leave to appeal

against that dismissal, Justice Dep (as His Lordship then was)

with Justice Wanasundera and Justice Jayawardena agreeing

held that: When the Provincial High Court exercises appellate

jurisdiction, it exercises appellate jurisdiction hitherto exclusively

8

vested in the Court of Appeal. It exercises a parallel or concurrent

jurisdiction with the Court of Appeal. The High Court when it

exercises appellate jurisdiction it is not subordinate to the Court of

Appeal. That is the basis for conferring jurisdiction on the

Supreme Court under section 9 of the High Court of Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 to hear appeals from the

judgments of the High Court when it exercises appellate

jurisdiction. I hold that the Accused AppellantPetitioner should

have filed a Special Leave to Appeal application against the

judgment of the High Court exercising Appellate Jurisdiction to the

Supreme Court in the first instance instead to the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal correctly upheld the preliminary objection and

rejected the Appeal.

Hence I hold that the Court of Appeal has no appellate

jurisdiction to set aside Judgments or Orders of the High Court

of Civil Appeal by way of final appeal, revision or restitutio in

intergrum. That is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.

Hence the first relief of the petitioners to set aside the Judgment

of the High Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura dated 22.10.2015

cannot be granted.

The next matter to be considered is whether the petitioners can

canvass the order of the learned District Judge dated

03.10.2017 by way of an application for restitutio in intergrum

such as the present one.

According to the paragraph 19 of the petition, against the said

Order of the District Court, the petitioners first filed an

application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum in the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura, but later withdrew it as the

9

High Court of Civil Appeal does not have jurisdiction for

restitution. According to paragraph 20 of the petition, the

petitioners then filed this application before this Court, as the

power for restitutio in integrum is vested in this Court.1 That

means, the petitioners have considered this application purely

as an application for restitutio in integrum, for otherwise, they

could have, without any difficulty, proceeded with the

application for revision filed in the High Court of Civil Appeal of

Ratnapura.

I must state that there is no magic in the word restitution, as

that relief, in my view, can also be sought in a revision

application. Although, in law, revision and restitutio in integrum

are two different applications, in practice, they go hand in hand,

and, almost all the time, are sought in combination.

I must also state that, in view of section 5D(2) of Act No.19 of

1990 (as introduced by Act No. 54 of 2006), the legislature has

not deliberately and completely shut out the High Court of Civil

Appeal from exercising jurisdiction on applications for restitutio

in intergrum as that section permits the President of the Court of

Appeal to send pending appeals, applications in revision and

restitutio in integrum to the relevant High Court of Civil Appeal

for hearing and determination.

Be that as it may, there is no dispute that the petitioners are not

parties to the case. They tried to intervene as parties, after the

pronouncement of the Partition Judgmentto be exact at the

Scheme Inquiry. According to section 69(1) of the Partition Law,

1 Paragraph 20 reads thus: The petitioners state that accordingly the petitioners prefer this application to Your Lordships Court whereas the power of restitutio in integrum is vested with your Lordships Court.

10

No.21 of 1977, as amended, Court can add parties only until the

Judgment is delivered. (Gnanapandithen v. Balanayagam [1998]

1 Sri LR 391 at 394)

It is trite law that an application for restitutio in integrum can

only be filed by a party to the action. (Vide Perera v.

Wijewickreme (1912) 15 NLR 411, Menchinahamy v. Muniweera

(1950) 52 NLR 409, Dissanayake v. Elisinahamy [1978/79] 2 Sri

LR 118, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam

[1995] 1 Sri LR 55, Fathima v. Mohideen [1998] 3 Sri LR 294 at

300, Velun Singho v. Suppiah [2007] 1 Sri LR 370)

The petitioners not being parties to the case, cannot, therefore,

come by way of restitutio in integrum against the Order of the

District Court dated 03.10.2017.

It is my considered view that, this application is misconceived in

law, and therefore shall be dismissed in limine, without issuing

notice to the respondents.

Notice refused. Application dismissed.
