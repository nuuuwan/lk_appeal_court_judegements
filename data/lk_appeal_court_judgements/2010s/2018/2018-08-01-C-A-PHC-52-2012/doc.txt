ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

',.',

The Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"Appellant") moved Magistrate's Court of Matale, by her application

under Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of

1979 as amended, for an order of ejection of the Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") from the State

land described in the schedule.

When the Magistrate's Court issued summons to show cause, the

Respondent challenged the standing of the Appellant on the basis that she

is not the Competent Authority who could institute an action for recovery

of possession of State lands. Learned Magistrate in his order dated

01.12.2008 dismissed the application on the basis that the Appellcpt has

3

. .

failed to establish the fact that she was appointed by the Hon. Minister

who is in charge of the subject by production of an appointment letter

either by tendering it to Court or annexing it to her application. In coming

to this determination, learned Magistrate apparently followed the

reasoning of the judgment of Alwis v Wedamulla, Additional Director;

General, U.D.A.(1997) 3 Sri L.R. 417.

The Appellant moved Provincial High Court holden in Kapdy

invoking its revisionary jurisdiction to set aside the order of dismissal by

the Magistrate's Court of Matate. At!er an inquiry, the Provincial High

, 'r, Court, by its order dated 07.12.2011 dismissed her petition by holding that

the Appellant has failed to establish that she was in fact the Competent

Authority at the time of the order of the Magistrate's Court, although there

was an appointment of a Competent Authority by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Plantations, by his letter dated 13.03.2009.

It is clear upon perusal of both these orders, the Magistrate's Court

as well as the Provincial High Court were of the view that the judgment of

Alwis v Wedamulla, Additional Director General, U.D.A. (ibid) imposed a

pre-condition for applying for an order of eviction under Section 5 of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the Competent Authority must

annex a copy of his letter of appointment.

4

The requirement imposed by the judgment of Jayasuriya J in Alwis

v Wedamulla, Additional Director General, U.D.A.is that;

the petition and- affidavit filed in the Magistrate's Court

ought to have set out and pleaded such delegation or

. appointment. There is no averment in the q,ffidavit and in

the documents filed that the Powers of the Director-

General have been delegated.

The Appellant, in the quit notice issued to the Respondent statectthat

she is the Competent Authority appointed by' the State Plantations.

Corporation/Janatha Estates Develdimwnt Board.. In her petition and

affidavit addressed to the Magistrate's Court of Ma~e, the Appellant has

averred that she is the Competent Authority appointed by the State

Plantations Corporatiori/JanathaEstates Development Board and has

thereby_ satisfied the said requirement.

In these circumstances, the order of the Magistrate's Court in

dismissing the application has been made upon a misapplication of the

requireJJ:leIlt imposed in Alwis v Wedamulla, Additional Director General,

U.D.A.

In the revision application filed before the Provincial High Court, the

Appellant has annexed a letter dated 05.05.2009, signed by Secretary to the

Ministry of Plantation Industries that the contract of the officer who has

functioned as Competent Authority would end on 30.09.2008. The quit

notice issued by the.said Competent Authority on the Respondent iSll"t1ated

16.D4.2008.The application seeking an order of eviction against the

5

..

'.

Respondent by the said Competent Authority was filed in the relevant

Magistrate's Court on 26.06.2008. In view of these circumstances, it is clear

at the time of issuing the quit notice and of filing an application for

ejectment, the officer who signed in as the Competent Authority had

proper authority as her term of office came to an end only on 30.09.2008.

The Provincial High Court, in its order of dismissal of the revision

application made two errors. Firstly, it erred in affirming the order of the

Magistrate's Court on this erroneous premise and secondly, it failed to note

that what is required is that the Competent Authority had to have such

authority to institute proceedings tcf seek an order of eviction against the

Respondent, at the time of institution of proceedings not at the time of the

order of eviction.

In addition to these errors made by the Magistrate's Court and the

Provincial High Court on the material placed before them, both these

Courts have also made a fundamental error which resulted in the denial

of relief to the Appellant. This fundamental error is a result of their

failure to give effect to the Statutory Provisions available in Sections 5

and 9(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as

amended.

The Respondent, when he was afforded an opportunity to show

cause under Section 6(1) of the Act, has raised an objection as to the

validity of the application for ejectment on the basis that the Appellant was

6

/

/ I

.-

'.

not appomted as the Competent Authority by placing reliance on the

judgment of Alwis v Wdamulla, Additional Director-General, U.D.A ..

In this judgment, Jayasuriya J, sitting alone, held the view that an

Additional Director General is not a Competent Authority as per the

definition of the term "Competent Authority" in the Urban Development

Authority Act, in relation to the matter before him.

His Lordship further held that;

"If there had been ci deleitUiOlJ of powers, rights and

I, functions of the Director General of the Urban

Development Authority to the Additional Director

General, then the _ petition and affidavit filed in the

Magistrate's Court ought to have set out and pleaded such

delegation or appointment. There is no averment in the

affidavit and in the documents filed that the powers of the

Director General have been delegated to A. Wedamulla, the

Additional- Director General did not have a locus standi

and aright and status to institute these proceedings."

It is clear that His Lordship considered only the question whether an

Additional Director General could be considered as a Competent

Authority as per the definition provided in the Urban Development

Authority Act. In the instant appeal, the Respondent forwarded his

objections under the Statutory Provisions of the State Lands (Recover,y; of .--Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

7

II

Therefore, this judgment could not be considered as an authority for

the proposition that when a Competent Authority makes an application

under Section 5(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, his

standing as the Competent Authority could be challenged by a'

Respondent before the Magistrate's Court.

It is necessary to examine the relevant statutory provisions

contained in the said Act, in determining the question whether a

Respondent in an application for ejectment could challenge the standing of

I the Competent Authority, upon being I~ummoned to show cause under

Section 6(1) of the Act,

This sub section imposes a duty on the Magistrate's Court 1/ to issue

summons on the person named in the application to appear and show cause '"

why such person and his dependents, if any should not be ejected from the

land" ,",

When such person on whom show cause was issued appears on the

due date and 1/ states that he has cause to show against the issue of an order

of ejectment" the Magistrate's Court could inquire into it.

Section 9(1) of the Act limits the scope of such an inquiry oply to

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a-valid

permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with

8

"-----~-----

any written law and that such permit or authority is in force arid not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. The judgments of Kandiah v

Abeykoon Sriskantha1s Law Reports, Vol. IV, p.9., Muhandiram v

Chairman, Janatha Estates Development Board (1992) 1 Sri L.R. 110 and

Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd., v Sri Lanka Ports Authority and'

Another (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 219 have recognized this limitation.

In addition to the said limitation in the scope of the inquiry, Se~tion

9(1) also imposes another restriction on the Respondent by the words "At -such inquiry the person on whom summons 'Under Section 6 has been served shall I, not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under Section

. ... " except that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid

permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with

any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. (emphasis added)

Section 5(1) imposes a duty on the Competent Authority to set out

certain facts in his application for ejectment and has included these factors

in Section 5(1)(a) and (b).

Section 5(1) (a) (i) of the Act reads thus;

"that he is a Competent Authority for the purpose of this Act,"

When these two statutory provisions are read together, it is clear

that the Legislature has intended that a Respondent, in an applicatifJfl for

.--. ejectment should not be allowed to contest before the Magistrate's Court,

9

against the claim by the Competent Authority in his application under

Section 5 that he is the Competent Authority for the purpose of this Act,

i.e., to make an application for ejectment.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the grounds

of appeal raised by the Appellant are with merit and her appeal ought to

be allowed.

Accordingly, we make order b allowing the appeal of the Appellant '., by setting aside both the orders, and directing the relevant Magistrate's

Court to issue an order under Section 10(1) of the said Act for ejection of

the Respondent and his dependants from the land described in the

schedule to the application.

The appeal is allowed. Parties will bear their costs.

JANAK DE SILVA, T.

I agree.
