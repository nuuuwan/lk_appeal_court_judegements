was imposed with a default term of 2 years RI for the first charge and for

the second charge 10 years RI with a fine of Rs. 10,000/= with a default

term of 2 years was imposed. He was also ordered to pay a sum of Rs.

1,00,000/= as compensation to the victim running a default term of 2

The second appellant was sentenced to 7 years RI with a fine of

Rs. 10,000/= running a default term of 2 years for the first charge and for

the third charge he was sentenced to 10 years RI with a fine of Rs.

10,000/= running a default term of 2 years RI he was also ordered to pay

Rs. 1,00,000/= as compensation to the victim with a default term of 2

years RI. This appeal is from the said conviction and sentence.

The story of the prosecution is on the day of the incident the

prosecutrix had been standing on the road side after the bus she was

travelling broken down when the appellants have come in a three wheeler

and forced her into the three wheeler and taken her to a guest house.

She was taken to a guest house in an isolated place and she was taken

into room and the appellants after locking the door had taken her clothes

off and raped her. The appellants have spent about four hours inside the

room with her and she has run to a nearby house and informed the

inmates of the house about what happened to her. While she was talking

3

to them the owner of the guest house h?d come in a motor cycle and after

,It

the inmates informed him about the incident he had taken her in the bike

to her house. She has gone to the police station to make a complaint on

the following day in the afternoon. She was produced before the Judicial

Medical Officer who has given evidence at the trial.

The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the learned

High Court Judge failed to consider the element of consent when

delivering his findings. According to the evidence of the prosecutrix after

she was taken into the guest house she has taken off her rings and put

them in her purse on the bed side table (page 82 of the proceedings).

She has also said that her National Identity Card was in the purse which

was later sent to her house by some person. If the prosecutrix was raped

as alleged how come she had all the time to take off her rings and put

them into her purse which was on the table? The register of the Hotel was

produced and marked as V1 by the investigating officer prosecution

witness number 3. According to this witness the names of the appellants

and the prosecutrix have been entered in the register. The number of the

prosecutrix's National Identity Card was also e,.,tered in this register. This

casts a serious doubt on the prosecutrix's evidence, if she was taken by

force she would not have given her Identity Card to the Hotel neither will

the appellant's register their names in the book.

4

The prosecutrix has given evidence in court to say that her clothes

were torn by the appellants and a blouse and a skirt was marked in court

and showed the torn places in both items of clothing. The officer who

inquired into the incident while giving evidence had said the skirt which

was a denim skirt was not torn. Prosecution witness number 5, the WPC

who recorded the prosecutrix's statement has testified that she did not

bring the clothes to the police station. The argument of the learned

counsel that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the test of

probability could be seen by these items of evidence. The learned High

Court Judge has failed to apply the terms of probability when analyzing

these evidence. The prosecution evidence have not been analysed on

question of probability against the medical evidence.

The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the learned

High Court Judge has acted contrary to section 165 of the Evidence

Ordinance when he encroached the role of the prosecution. We find on

perusal of the proceeding the learned High Court Judge who delivered

the judgment had taken over the role of the prosecutor on several

occasions by which he has denied the appellants a fair trial.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the learned High

Court Judge has correctly analysed the evidence and considered the

'~~~.~;~~~,:; -.-.'..:.;....~ .. ,.:: ... ~. ':';'.::;:'J-:';'1f'~~i!~'''~_:~: .;;.:j,_ ... =,;:~_~

. contradictions when delivering his findings. He further stated that the

learned High Court Judge has carefully evaluated the medical evidence

when he came to the conclusion on the ingredient of lack of consent

which is needed to prove a charge of rape.

He also stated that the tests of probability, consistency and

contemporaneity was applied to the defence evidence, and arrived at the

conclusion that the defence evidence was not creditworthy.

The appellant's counsel cited the judgments in The Queen vs

David Perera 66 NLR 553 on the issue of the learned High Court Judge

continuously questing the witnesses. In the above case it was held that;

itA Judge is not entitled to put leading questions, the

answers to which are calculated to prejudice the accused.

Further, he must not ask questions in such manner or in

such great number as to encroach upon the functions of a

Counsel who appears in the case."

This is very relevant to the instant case. Where the learned High

Court Judge has encroached the functions of the prosecutor.

6

The appellant's counsel also cited the case of AG vs Priyantha

2002 SLR Vol 2 page 96 and argued that the medical evidence was

contrary to the prosecutrix's evidence and that according to the short

history given to the doctor it should be gang rape.

As stated in Hitihamy Mudiyanselage Nimalchandra vs AG CA

80/2011 delivered on 11.12.2012 "In a charge of rape ifthe prosecution

evidence reveals that the sexual intercourse was performed with the

consent of the victim the accused is entitled to be acquitted. Further if the

court feels that there is a reasonable doubt on the question that sexual

intercourse was performed with the consent of the victim the accused

should be acquitted."

I n the instant case both these elements are present.

In Sunil and another vs AG 1986 I SLR 230 it was held;

"It is very dangerous to act on uncorroborated testimony of

a women victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is

convincing such evidence could be acted on even in the

absence of corroboration. "

7

I n the instant case the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither

corroborated nor convincing. Therefore we find that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the testimony of the

witnesses for prosecutrix as well as the defence. He has failed to apply

the tests of probability and consistency and misdirected himself and by

doing so has erred in law.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to set aside the judgment

dated 20101/2016 of High Court and acquit the appellants.

Appeal allowed.
