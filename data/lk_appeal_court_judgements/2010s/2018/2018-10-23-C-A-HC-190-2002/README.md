ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

This is an appeal by the 4th and 5th Accused -Appellants, ~hallenging

the validity of their conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court of

Colombo in case No. 8077/1996 on 31st October 2002. The 6th Accused-

Appellant has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in

application No. CA (PHC) APN 151/11 challenging the validity of his

conviction and sentence. When this appeal was taken up for hearing on

31.08.2018, the said application was withdrawn with the understanding to

consider the 6th Accused-Petitioner's case along with the appeal of the 4th

and 5th Accused-Appellants.

In the indictment presented by the Hon. Attorney General to the

High Court, the 4th and 5th Accused-Appellants and 6th Accused-Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the 1/ Appellants") were charged with seven

other Accused, namely Velupillai Prabhakaran (1st Accused), Sivasnakar alias

Pottu Amman (2nd Accused), Kandiah Jeewamohan alias charles Master (3rd

Accused), Rajadurai Saturukulasingham (7th Accused), Kandiah Sri Ganesh (8th

Accused), Ramaiyah Papathi (9th Accused) and Karupiayah Kamalanathan (10th

Accused). It is alleged that they were involved with the incident generally

known as the" Central Bank Bombing."

There were 712 counts in total, In the indictment including

conspiracy to commit mischief, causing mischief, aiding and abetting to

cause mischief, causing death of 76 persons and its abetment which are

offences punishable under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism

2

(Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended. The prosecution

had listed 493 witnesses and 104 items of productions, at its back.

The trial proceeded in the absence of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th,

, and 10th Accused. After the evidence, the trial Court pronounced its

judgment convicting the 4th , 5th and 6th Appellants along with the others.

Subsequent to his conviction and sentence, the 6th Accused-

Appellant was arrested and produced before the trial Court. On 18th

January 2010, his sentence was imposed having read out the judgment of

the Court.

At the hearing of their appeal along with the revision application,

learned Counsel for the Appellants has informed Court that he does not

wish to challenge their convictions but would challenge legality and

propriety of the sentences that had been imposed on the Appellants.

The basis of his submission on the sentence stems from the decision

of the trial Court as claimed by the Appellants in their written submissions

that " ... sentences in respect of Courts 1 to 10 were ordered to run

consecutively - totalling 200 years of imprisonment ... ".

It is submitted by the Appellants that the consecutive sentence of

imprisonment in respect of 1st to 10th counts aggregates at 200 years, and it

extends well beyond the natural life time of a human being. The

Appellants contend that the said consecutive sentence of imprisonment

conflicts with the statutory provisions contained in Section 67 of the Penal

Code.

3

He cited the following quotation from Emmins on Principles of

Sentencing (2nd Editioh, p.149 and 150) in support of his submissions

where it is stated that;

" ... as the facts of the two offences 1vere inextricably lznked, the

terms should have been concurrent. Even where ... the offender

has committed two quite distinct ojfences, sentences lmposed

should still be concurrent where the offences arise from the same

set of facts: the same 'occasion: of the 'same transaction' as it is

sometimes pu t ... "

In addition, the Appellants relied upon the judgment of Rex v Ayudhiya

(1882) 1 LR 2 All 644 where it had been held as follows :-

". .. where in the course of one and the same transaction an

accused appears to have done several acts, directed to one end, but

which when combined together amount to a more serious offence,

although the purpose of trial it may be illegal to charge the

accused with not only the principle but also the subsidiary

offences, yet in the interests of simplicity and convenience it is

best to concentrate the conviction and sentence on the gravest

offence."

Therefore, the Appellants contended that the decision of the

sentencing Court to impose sentences of imprisonment to run

consecutively is a "misdirection" since, these several but identical offences

4

were committed during /I the same day, time and incident" and under the

/I same set of circumstances". It is also submitted that the Appellants show

their remorse and regret by limiting their appeal to the sentence only at this

juncture. They were in remand since 1996, had no personal gain over the

commission of these offences and had acted only on their political

ideology.

Learned Additional Solicitor General for the Respondent made oral

and written submissions in reply and she had referred to the items of

direct evidence that are available against each Appellant in justifying the

imposition of a long sentence. We would refer to the submissions of the

Respondent as we proceed along with the judgment.

In view of the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

Appellants, the fundamental questions to be decided by this Court is

whether the said consecutive sentence of imprisonment imposed on the 6th

Appellant in respect of 1st to 10th counts is a legally valid sentence or not

and if it is a legally valid sentence, whether it is justifiable to impose such a

sentence under the circumstances.

The High Court of Colombo, In its judgment convicted the

Appellants as follows;

1. The 4th Appellant was found guilty of Count Nos. 1, 2, 11 to 16,

18 to 20, 22 to 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37 to 39, 41 to 52, 56 to 60, 62, 65,

66, 69, 76, 77, 80, 81 and 82.

5

2. The 5th Appellant was found guilty of Count Nos. I, 2, 11 to 16,

18 to 20, 22 to 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37 to 39, 41 to 52, 56 to 60, 62, 65,

66, 69, 76, 77, 80, 81 and 82.

3. The 6th Appellant was found guilty of Count Nos. I, 6, 223 to 328,

330 to 332, 334 to 341, 343, 344, 346, 347, 349 to 351, 353 to 364, 368

to 372, 374, 377, 378,381,388,389,392,393 and 394.

It also found the 1st Accused guilty of Count Nos. 1 and 2, the 8th

Accused guilty of Count Nos. 1 and 8 and the 10th Accused guilty of

Count Nos. 1 and 10.

The sentences imposed by the High Court on each Appellant are as

follows :-

1. The 4th Appellant was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment in

respect of Count No. 1 and for the remaining Counts, life

sentences were imposed.

2. The 5th Appellant was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment in

respect of Count No. 1 and for the remaining Counts, life

sentences were imposed.

3. The 6th Appellant was sentenced along with 1st, 8th and 10th

Accused to imprisonment of 20 years in respect of each of the

Counts they were charged with. The Court further directed that

the sentence of 20 years imprisonment imposed on the first 10

6

Counts to run consecutively for a total period of 200 years and

the remainder of the 20 years of imprisonments to run

concurrently.

In imposing the said sentences on the Appellants and other

Accused, the High Court had considered the following facts:

a. 76 persons have died as a result of the attack and Counts In

respect of 51 such deaths were proved,

b. the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has suffered damage due to

mischief at an estimated value of Rs. 550 Million.

c. it is the duty of the Court to keep the 1st, 8th and 10th Accused and

6th Appellant away from society as long as it could

Thereafter, it proceeded to impose the above quoted sentences on

the Appellants.

In imposing a 20 year term of imprisonment on 1st Accused, 4th to

6th Appellants, 8th Accused and 10th Accused, upon their conviction the 1st

Count, the Court had thought it fit to impose the maximum punishment it

could under Section 3(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary

Provisions) Act since the said Section confers discretion on the sentencing

Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment of either description for a

period of "not less than five years bu t not exceeding twenty years" for the

offence of conspiracy to commit mischief to the property of Government.

7

The conviction of the 6th Appellant to Count No.6 for abetment also

attracted punishment under Section 2(I)(e) read with Section 3(b) of the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of imprisonment of

either description for a period of "not less than five years but not exceeding

twenty years". The remaining Counts of 223 to 328, 330 to 332, 334 to 341,

343, 344, 346, 347, 349 to 351, 353 to 364, 368 to 372, 374, 377, 378, 381, 388,

389, 392, 393 and 394 related to abetment to causing death of persons as

per Counts 11 to 88. These are identical offences in relation to several

deaths. The prescribed punishment for these Counts as per Section 2(I)(e)

read with Section 3(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary

Provisions) Act of imprisonment of either description for a period of "not

less than five years but not exceeding twenty years".

It must be noted that the 6th Appellant was found guilty and was

sentenced under the same penal section which carried an imprisonment of

either description for a period of "not less than five years bu t not exceeding

twenty years".

In view of the identical penal provisions, the sentencing Court had

made order that out of the sentences imposed on the 6th Appellant, the

sentences that are imposed on him in relation to Counts 1, 6, 223, 224, 225,

226, 227,228,229,230 to run consecutively to make up for 200 years,

whereas similar punishments in relation to the remaining counts to run

concurrently.

In addition, the Court had also imposed life sentences on the 4th and

5th Appellants upon their conviction of the remaining Counts. It is

observed that Count No.2, is in relation to an offence punishable under

8

Section 2(2)(e) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act

which also prescribes a sentence of imprisonment of either description for

a period of "not less than five years but not exceeding twenty years" for

committing mischief to the property of Government, but the Court had

imposed a life sentence.

Count Nos. 11 to 16, 18 to 20, 22 to 29,31,32,34,35,37 to 39, 41 to 52,

56 to 60, 62, 65, 66, 69, 76, 77, 80, 81 and 82 refers to causing death of

persons, which are punishable under Section 3 of the Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, which imposes a mandatory life

term. The 5th and 6th Appellants were therefore imposed life sentences in

relation to above numbered Counts upon their conviction.

Returning to the complaint of the learned Counsel for the

Appellants for imposition of a 200 years of imprisonment, it is evident

from the above, that it only applies to the 6th Appellant. Other Accused

who were imposed the said sentence along with the 6th Appellant have not

preferred any appeals against it.

Having considered the individual sentences imposed on each of the

Appellants and the statutorily prescribed punishment for the offences they

had committed, we should now turn our attention to the legality of the

said sentence of 200 years of imprisonment imposed on the 6th Appellant.

The 6th Appellant did not challenge the imposition of the 20 years of

imprisonment on each of the counts he was found guilty to. His grievance

is limited to imposition of consecutive sentences on him totalling 200

years.

9

In view of the 6th Appellant's grievance as submitted by his Counsel,

this Court should examine the validity of imposition of a consecutive

sentences vis a vis Section 67 of the Penal Code.

Article 13(4) of the Constitution of the Republic states as follows :-

"No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except

by order of a competent Court, made in accordance with the

procedure established by law."

Section 10 of the Judicature Act empowers the Judges of the High

Court to "impose any sentence or other penalty prescribed by written law". A

similar provision contains in Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

This statutory provision confers power on the High Court to impose

"any sentence or other penalty" but such sentence must be a one "prescribed

by written law".

The written law which prescribes the sentence, in relation to the

instant appeal could be found in Sections 2 and 3 of the Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979 as referred to in the

preceding paragraphs, in dealing with the description of sentences.

Therefore, the sentences that are imposed by the High Court on the

Appellants are in fact "prescribed by written law". It is therefore clear that

the sentence imposed on each count is per se a legal sentence as the Court

had acted within the statutory scheme of punishment. The Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act only lays down the prescribed

sentence in relation to the several offences it had defined in Sections 2 and

3. It does not provide the manner in which these sentences are to be carried

out.

10

The statutory scheme of the procedure, in the imposition of

sentences and carrying them out, is found in Chapter III of the Penal Code

and particularly in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants, as already noted, placed heavy

reliance on Section 67 of the Penal Code, in challenging the legality of the

sentence imposed on the 6th Appellant.

Section 67 of the Penal Code reads as follows :-

"Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of

which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished

with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless

it be so expressly provided.

Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate

definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences

are defined or punished; or

Where several acts of which one, or more than one, would by itself

or themselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a

different offence; the offender shall not be punished with a more

severe punishment that the Court which tries him could award for

anyone of such offences. 1/

Before this Court ventures to consider the provisions of Section 67 of

the Penal Code, it is preferable to consider some of the judgments that

have already considered its applicability in imposing a sentence.

11

In Mendis v Cornelis 3 N.L.R. 196, Bonser CJ was of the view that in

relation to sentences imposed upon conviction for house breaking with

intention to commit theft and of theft, Section 67 of the Penal Code has no

application as they are "distinct offences". This is a contrary view to the

judgment of Withers J in The Queen v Nandua1 N.L.R. 317, where it was

held that:-

"In this case clearly the principal offence was riot. Some of the

accused assembled together with the sale object of assaulting Mr.

Cane. They affected their purpose. Riot was thus the principal

offence they committed. That act of riot again was made up of two

other offences, unlawful assembly and voluntarily causing hurt,

which was the object of the assembly. They therefore should only

be punished for the principal offence of riot. This case comes

within the provisions of section 67 of our Penal Code./I

In Alwis Appu v Bansagayah 49 N.L.R. 66, where the accused had

been punished for the offence of robbery and is also punished for the

offence of hurt, Soertsz SPJ held the view that hurt being an integral part

of the offence of robbery and therefore "is not allowed by law."

In the appeal of Inspector of Police v. De Zoysa 31 N.L.R. 127, the

Accused was charged with voluntarily causing hurt to a Police officer,

punishable under Section 314 of the Penal Code and also for assaulting the

same officer with intent to dishonour him without any grave and sudden

12

provocation, punishable under Section 346 of the Penal Code. Akbar J,

sitting alone, has held that;

"It is true that an assault on an Inspector of Police by an accused

whom he is going to charge in Court is a serious offence and

deserves to be punished severely, but at the same time these two

charges are so connected together that I think the first charge is

included in the second and that the two counts have been brought

in merely to get the double punishment which the Court can

award under section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Under

that section, when a person is convicted at one trial of any two or

more distinct offences, in the. case of a Police Court the

punishment cannot exceed twice the amount of punishment which

it is competent to inflict, So that it is under that section that the

Police Magistrate apparently horrified at the enormity of the

offence, committed within the precincts of the Police Court, has

sentenced the accused to a year's rigorous imprisonment.

It was a foolish act of the accused, and he stated to the Court that

he was provoked because he was assaulted by eight of them,

meaning thereby, I suppose, that he was assaulted by the

constables at the Police Station. But whatever that may be, under

section 67 of the Penal Code there is a distinct injunction that

where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate

definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences

are defined or punished, the offender is not to be punished with a

more severe punishment t!zan the Court which tries him could

award for anyone of sllch offences. Now, the Police Court could

not a7l'ard more than six months' rigorolls imprisonment for each

one of these COllnts. I, therefore, t'link that tlze pWlishment slzould

13

be reduced from twelve months I rzgorous imprisonment to six

months I rzgorous imprisonment on each count to run

concurrently. "

In Sub Inspector of Police, Chilaw v Erebinu31 N.L.R. 446, Jayewardene AJ

held that;

"The principle underlying section 67 of the Penal Code is that

where the intention was to commit an offence, the commission of

which involves the perpetration of acts themselves punishable, the

offender should not be punished for them separately, as his object

was to commit one crime, not many."

It is evident from these judgments, that it has been the consistent

view held by their Lordships that Section 67 does not apply in situations

where the offender is convicted on distinct offences committed against the

same individual.

Then a question arises as to whether the High Court could impose

sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively if the offender is convicted

of distinct offences. Section 16 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979 provides the answer.

Section 16 (1) reads thus :-

"TNhen a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more

distinct offences the court may, subject to section 30t sentence

him for such offences to the several punishments prescribed

therefor which sllch collrt is competent to inflict; sllch 14

punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence,

unless the court orders them or any of them to run concurrently,

the one after the expiration of the other in such order as the court

may direct, even where the aggregate punishment for the se~veral

offences is in excess of the punishment which the court is

competent to inflict on conviction of one single offence:

Provided that if the case is tried by a Magistrate's Court the

aggregate punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of

punishment which such court in the exercise of its ordinary

jurisdiction is competent to inflict.

It is important to note from section 16 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act that it is subject to Section 301 of that Act.

Section 301, reads thus :-

"The provisions of sections 55 and 67 of the Penal Code shall

apply to all offences whatever. /I

Clearly this Section imposes a mandatory requirement on Court to

give effect to provisions contained in Section 67 of the Penal Code, m

sentencing an offender under Section 16.

When one compares Section 67 of the Penal Code and Section 16 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, it is apparent that there is a conflict if

one were to implement both schemes. This apparent conflict between a

legal provision in a substantial law and another in the procedural law had

15

already received attention and this Court made an attempt to reconcile it

by providing a solution based on interpretation of the two sections.

In delivering the judgment of Costa v ASP CID Colombo 50 N.L.R.

574 Nagalingam J. sitting alone, states thus:-

"There can be little doubt that each of the three offences of which

the-accused has been found guilty is a distinct offence and that the

appellant was rightly sentenced to separate tenns of

imprisonment in respect of each of them; there can be equally little

doubt that the Magistrate had jurisdiction under this section to

direct that the sentences in respect of two or more offences should

run consecutively. But the Court cannot give effect solely to

section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code and ignore the

provisions of section 67 of the Penal Code. There is an apparent

conflict between these two provisions of our penal statutes. The

conflict should, if possible, be harmonised and the two provisions

read in such a manner as to give effect to both provisions without

any conflict resulting therefrom. This object can be achieved, to

my mind, by excluding from the operation of section 17 of the

Criminal Procedure Code those cases, which would fall within the

ambit of section 67 of the Penal Code. Read in this way the two

sections are perfectly complementary and lead to no conflict. The

position, therefore, is that, where the distinct offences of which the

accused person is found guilty are such that the acts which

constitute one or more of those offences in combination do not

constitute the other offence or offences, the provisions of section

17 of the Criminal Procedure Code would be applicable, bIlt not

otherwise; and in the latfer event the provisions of section 67 of

the Penal Code wOllld govern that case. The appellant's case falls

16

in this view of the matter under section 67 of the Penal Code, and

he should not have had his sentences directed to run consecutively

in respect of the first and second charges of which he was

convicted. 1/

Upon plain reading of Section 67, it is evident that it consists of two

segments. The first segment deals with situations where the Accused is

charged for an offence which "is made up of parts, any of which parts itself is

an offence". In such a situation such an Accused II shall not be punished with

the punishment of more than one of such offences unless it to be so expressly

provided" .

The second segment of the said section contains two parts within it.

The first part deals with situations where II anything is falling within two or

more separate definitions of any law ... by which offences are defined or

punished."

It its second part, the section deals with situations where II several acts

of which one, or more than one, would by itself or themselves constitute an offence,

constitute when combined a different offence".

In both these situations, the discretion of Court, in relation to

imposition of punishment, is limited by the section as it states "". the

offender shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which

tries him could award for anyone of such offences."

This section is further explained in the Penal Code by two

illustrations. The first illustration is an instance of one strikes another 50

times with a stick. Upon conviction on 50 such counts of voluntarily

17

causing hurt, instead of imposition of 50 times the prescribed sentence, the

offender was made liable to one such punishment only.

However, the second illustration concerns causing hurt to a third

person in the same transaction, in addition to the first person. In such a

situation of course, the offender is liable to be punished separately for

causing hurt to the first person and third person.

In effect, this Section imposes a ceiling on the imposition of legally

prescribed punishment that could be imposed on an offender for each of

the counts he was charged and convicted with if a certain criterion is met.

The applicable criterion for an offender to be qualified to become entitled

to the concession granted by the said section is that the offences, such an

offender is charged with are;

a. " ... made up of parts, any of which parts itself as offence"

b. " ... falling within two or more separate definitions of any law ...

by which offences are defined or punished."

c. "several acts of which one, or more than one, would by itself or

themselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a

different offence"

If the offender qualifies under any of these, then he is entitled not to

"be punished 'with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could

muard for anyone of SLlch offences."

18

The illustrations clearly point to a situation in which an exception to

the said general rule is created. That is where a situation in which a third

person is involved as a victim. It could be seen from the illustration (b) to

Section 67, that if the acts of offending are committed in respect of two

persons, each such act, although similar to each other, ought to be

punished separately. But such offending is in respect of one person, then, if

the offender qualifies himself under any of the three situations identified

as above, he is entitled to the concession under Section 67.

As noted above the count Nos. 1 and 2 against the 6th Appellant are

clearly distinct offences. Then the remaining several Counts of abetment

on which the 6th Appellant was convicted of are identical in nature, except

for names of the persons who died. All these offences carry the identical

statutorily prescribed sentence of imprisonment not less than 20 years.

It is not possible to consider the offences of conspiracy to commit

mischief, committing mischief, causing death of persons and abetment to

cause death of each of the 51 persons as offences that are "made up of parts,

any of which parts itself as offence" or ''falling within two or more separate

definitions of any law ... by which offences are defined or punished" or "several

acts of which one, or more than one, would by itself or themselves

constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different offence".

Learned Counsel for the Appellants did not address us as to the

basis on which the provisions of Section 67 become applicable to the

situation in the instant appeal. None of the offences that had been

committed by the 6th Appellant could be categorised as coming under any

19

of the three situations as reflected in Section 67 of the Penal Code as they

are clearly distinct offences. This Court prefers to adopt the approach of

Nagalingam J in Costa v ASP CID Colombo(supra) in resolving this issue

as raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellants.

With due respect to learned Counsel for the Appellants, we are not

inclined to accept his submission that the sentences imposed on the 6th

Appellant are in violation of the provisions contained in Section 67 of the

Penal Code for the aforesaid reasons. In our opinion, Section 67 has no

application to the offences the 6th Appellant was convicted and sentenced

to, although most of them are identical but forms a series of distinct

offences. We derive support for this view by reference to the provisions of

Section 16(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Section 16(2) reads as follows:-

"For the purpose of appeal aggregate sentences imposed under

subsection (1) in case of convictions for several offences at one

trial shall be deemed to be a single sentence."

It is clear that when a Court had imposed sentences of imprisonment

to run consecutively in respect of each of the distinct offences the offender

was found guilty to, an appellate Court should consider that aggregate

sentences as a 1/ single sentence" in view of this deeming provision.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants relied on a quotation from

Emmins on Principles of Sentencing in support of his submissions.

20

The quotation reads thus :-

" ... as the facts of the two offences were inextricably linked, the

terms should have been concurrent. Even where ... the offender

has committed two quite distinct offences, sentences imposed

should still be concurrent where the offences arise from the same

set of facts: the same 'occasion' of the 'same transaction' as it is

sometimes put ... "

The principle emphasised by the learned author in the said text that

"Even where ... the offender has committed two quite distinct offences, sentences

imposed should still be concurrent where the offences arise from the same set of

facts: the same 'occasion' of the 'same transaction' as it is sometimes put" is in

direct conflict with the consistent approach adopted by our Courts which

are bound by the provisions of Section 67 of the Penal Code and Section 16

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

We are mindful of the fact that in Sri Lankan context there is no

statutorily laid down sentencing policy which had been developed with

the institutional support of specialised agencies that had been tasked to

provide theoretical and statistical input in formulating such a policy. The

above quotation is from an author who is familiar with the jurisdiction of

United Kingdom where common law traditions are followed. But in Sri

Lankan context, except for some statutory provisions touching upon the

question of sentencing and judicial pronouncements by superior Courts,

we are bereft of a comprehensive sentencing policy that suits the local

21

conditions, which had been moulded in the universally accepted norms of

sentencing.

With the amendments brought in to Section 303 and 304 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act with Act No. 47 of 1999, certain considerations

were identified for the attention of the sentencing Courts when they decide

the question whether a suspended sentence should be imposed or not.

Thereafter, another consideration was added by Act No. 14 of 2005, to

Section 154(3), when an Accused indicates his willingness to tender a plea

of guilt to a lesser offence in the context of an indictable offence before a

High Court. This amendment required the sentencing Court to "have

regard" to the fact that the Accused had indicated in the Magistrate's

Court of his willingness to plead guilty to a lesser offence. The imposition

of statutory minimum sentence by the Legislature in several enactments is

outside the scope of this determination and therefore will not be

considered.

Returning to the said quotation, relied upon by the Appellants, we

note that it is contained in a chapter titled "Concurrent and consecutive

custodial sentences and totality principle." As the title to the Chapter

indicates, the principles that are highlighted in the text, are developed

under the "Totality Principle".

Said principle is explained In Sentencing & Criminal Justice

Criminal Justice by Andrew Ashworth (3rd Ed) at p. 226 as follows:-

"iNhere it is appropriate to impose consecllti'l'e sentences rather

than concurrent sentences, ... the basic approach is for the COllrt

22

to calculate separate sentences for each of the offences and then to

add them together. This could, however, lead to high overall

sentence- placing thefts aLongside rape, or burglaries alongside

robbery, in terms of length of custody. The Courts have the~efore

evolved a principle which Thomas has called 'the totality

principle', which requires a Court to consider the overall sentence

in relation to the totality of the offending and in relation to

sentence level for other crimes./I

Learned author states (at p.226) that the authority on which this

principle was formulated "may be found in an unreported judgment of

Barton in 1972," where it is observed that:-

"When cases of multiplicity of offences come before the Court, the

Court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing

the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the

totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what the

appropriate sentence for all the offences is./I

The sentencing policy of the English Courts are clearly laid down in

the sentencing guidelines which in turn is based on totality principle.

Therefore those Courts are bound to follow the said guidelines as per

Section 125(1) of the Coroners and Justices Act 2009.

In Mill v The Queen [ 1988] HCA 70, the High Court of Australia

reproduced the above quotation from Barton in re-emphasising its

23

applicability as it observed that "when number of offences are being dealt with

and specific punishments in respect of them are totted up to make a total, it is

always necessary for the Court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it

looks wrong."

The Canadian Supreme Court, in R v Khawaja [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555,

stated that "the general principles of sentencing, including the totality principle,

apply to terrorism cases."

The Sentencing Council of United Kingdom, in its June 2012

guidelines, say that the totality principle comprises of following two

elements :-

1. "all Courts, when sentencing for more than a single offence, should pass a

total sentence which reflects all the offending behaviour before it and is just

and proportionate. This is so whether the sentences are structured as

concurrent or consecutive. Therefore, concurrent sentences will ordinarily be

longer than a single sentence for a single offence.

2. it is usually impossible to arrive at a just and proportionate sentence for

multiple offending simply by adding together notional single sentences. It is

necessary to address the factors personal to the offender as a whole. II

It appears from the above quotations that the contention of the

Appellant, although it claims to have been based on Section 67 of the Penal

Code, is actually more or less based on the totality principle which had

been adopted in Courts where the common law tradition is followed, with

24

necessary statutory backing. In effect, the totality principle, as Ashworth

notes (at p.226) "would clearly produce what is in effect a discount for bulk

offending."

Section 67, even if it is applicable to the instant appeal; could not

have been formulated by adopting totality principle as it emerged only in

the early seventies, not in 1887 when the Penal Code was enacted. Clearly

the totality principle is not part of our law and we did not come across any

precedent where it had been applied in determining sentence by our

superior Courts.

In the divisional bench decision of the apex Court in Attorney General &

Others v Sumathipala (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 126 it was held :-

"As stated by Viscount Simonds in Magor and St. Mellons

RDC v Newport Corporation ([1952] A.c. 189) a Judge

cannot under a thin guise of interpretation usurp the function of

the legislature to achieve a result that the Judge thinks is desirable

in the interests of justice. Therefore, the role of the Judge is to give

effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as it is the bounden

duty of any Court and the function of every Judge to do jllstice

within the stipulated parameters. Referring to the fllnction of a

Jlldge, Jllstice Dr.Amerasinghe, was of the view that (Judicial

Condllct, Ethics and Responsibilities, pg. 284),

II The fllnction of a jlldge is to give effect to the expressed

intention of Parliament. If legislation needs amendment,

becallse it reslllts in injustice, the democratic process must

be llsed to bring about the change. This has been the

llnchallenged z'ic71' expressed by the Sllpreme COllrt of Sri

Lanka for allllost a 11l/JIdred years. III Government

25

Agent, Superintendent of Police v Suddhana et al.

([1905] V Tambiyah's Reports 39) Chief Justice Layard

said, at the time when the Privy Council was the

country's apex tribunal:

"If we wrongly construe the law the remedy is by

appeal to His Majesty in Council. If on the other

hand we rightly construe the law and the law is

unpalatable to any section of the community, the

remedy of that section of the community is to

endeavour, if possible to have the law amended.

Such endeavours, however, should be

constitutional. "

Though applied in most of the common law countries, adopting

such a principle to this jurisdiction in view of the above quotation, is best

left to Legislature if it thinks appropriate.

However, this Court must address its mind to the question of

legality and propriety of imposition of long sentences. In the early part of

this judgment, referring to the relevant statutory provisions we have

already held that the imposition of the long sentence on the 6th Appellant

is legally correct.

Therefore, what remains is to consider the propriety of the said

sentence.

26

The 6th Appellant and his co-accused were convicted of offences

recognised by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act.

Learned Additional Solicitor General has addressed us as to the nature of

the available evidence in respect of each of the Appellants, in justifying the

sentence imposed by the High Court. There is no challenge that these

offences are committed while carrying on a meticulously planned, well-

rehearsed, suicidal attack on a purely an economic, therefore purely a

civilian target, with the intention of causing maximum possible damage to

life and property. Of course, it is said that the Appellants were motivated

by their political ideology. Undoubtedly, this attack on the nerve centre of

Sri Lanka's economy, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, could be termed as Sri

Lanka's equivalent of 1/9/11", which had undoubtedly shocked the

national conscience. This was a plain and simple act of absolute terrorism.

Unlike in January 1996, when the Appellant committed these

offences, as at present terrorism has spread its tentacles from south Asia,

Africa and Latin America to western democracies and had evolved itself as

a global threat to democracy. Therefore, it is relevant to examine the

sentencing principles that had evolved over time, founded on common law

principles, in response to the threat of terrorism.

In R v Mohammed Abdul Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, five

Justices of the Court of Appeal, having considered several connected

appeals from the Crown Court, decided to offer "more detailed guidelines in

relation to sentences that should be imposed" under Section 5 of the Terrorism

Act 2006.

27

Section 5 of the said Act provides :-

1/1. A person commits an offence if, with the intention of -

(a) committing acts of terrorism, or

(b) assisting another to commit such acts

he engages in conduct in preparation for giving effect

to his intention.

2. It is irrelevant for the purpose of subsection (1) whether

the intention and preparation relate to one or more

particular acts of terrorism, acts of terrorism of a

particular description, or acts of terrorism generally. /I

Their Lordships have, at the outset of the said judgment quoted with

approval the following passage from R v F [2007] EWCA Crim 243;

" the legislation does not exempt, nor make an

exception, nor create a defence for, nor exculpate what

some would describe as terrorism in a just cause. Such a

concept is foreign to the 2000 Act. Terrorism is terrorism

whatever the motives of the perpetrators ...

... the terrorist legislation applies to cOllntries which are

governed by tyrants and dictators. There is no exemption

from criminal liability for terrorist activities which are

motivated by, or said to be morally justified by, the alleged

nobility of the terrorist calise. /I

28

In determining the appropriate sentence in a case of s. 5, their

Lordships introduced a scale starting with Level 1 to Level 6 in descending

order to determine the "Levels of Offending" .

Level I, being the highest in the said scale, is described as 'follows;

"The highest level in our view is where the offender has

taken steps which amounts to attempted multiple murder,

or something not far short of it, or to a conspiracy to

commit multiple murder if it is likely to lead to an attempt

that is likely to succeed - but no physical harm has been

caused. Given the particular gravity of terrorist offences,

the Definitive Guidelines issued by the Sentencing

Guidelines Council in relation to attempted murder is not

directly applicable. We should include within this level

cases which, if charged under s.5, would have included the

circumstances in Ibrahim & Others [2008] EWCA Crim

880 (Conspiracy to murder- the 21/7 plot in which four

bombs were detonated on the London Underground but

failed to explode, and life sentences with minimum terms

of 40 years, imposed after trial, were upheld on appeal);

Abdullah Ahmed Ali & Others [2011] 2 Cr App R 22

(Conspiracy to murder by causing explosions on

transatlantic airliners -where life sentences with

minimum teml of between 32 to 40 years were imposed

after trial and the sale appeal against sentence was

dismissed); and Barot (conspiracy to murder, where the

mzmmum term which this COllrt imposed, after a plea

attracting 10% discollnt, was 30 years). For sllch an

29

offence a sentence of life imprisonment with minimum

term of 30 to 40 years or more is appropriate."

Having applied the totality principle, the setting up of life

imprisonment with minimum term of 30 to 40 years or more by the Court

of Appeal is a clear indication of the seriousness in which the sentencing in

relation to persons who are convicted of terrorism offences such as

/I attempted multiple murder" and not actual multiple murder.

These guidelines have no direct application to our legal system. But

its persuasive value should be appreciated by this Court, in order to be

consistent with the sentencing policy in other jurisdictions against

terrorism. This is not an attempt to review the sentence imposed by the

High Court through the lens of English principles on sentencing of

terrorists.

The 6th Appellant was pronounced of his sentences by the High

Court on 31.10.2002.

In imposing the sentence of 200 years on the 6th Appellant, the High

Court had considered the following facts;

a. 76 persons have died as a result of the attack and Counts In

respect of 51 such deaths were proved,

b. the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has suffered damage due to

mischief at an estimated value of Rs. 550 Million.

c. it is the duty of the Court to keep the 1st, 8th and 10th Accused and

6th Appellant away from society as long as it could.

30

The High Court confined the sentence to 10 Counts, when in fact it

found the 6th Appellant guilty of more than 50 Counts, a clear indication

that it did not impose the said sentence on mere arithmetical calculation as

commented by Barton (supra). It also suggests that the High .Court was

alive to the proportionality of the sentencing when it confined the sentence

to 10 such Counts.

The evidence revealed that it was the 6th Appellant who drove the

explosive laden lorry, which later rammed into the Central Bank building,

from Vavunia to Colombo and again on the day of the attack from a lorry

parked in Colombo at 6.00 a.m. He had then left for Vavunia and had

picked up his pass to cross over to the uncleared area at the Thandikulam

check point at 4.00 p.m. on the same day.

The 4th and 5th Appellants were apprehended almost immediately

after the attack and there were direct and circumstantial evidence to

implicate them of their complicity to the attack.

The High Court had considered the gravity of the offending acts as

did the Canadian Supreme Court in R v Khawaja (supra) whereby

determining the high degree of mens rea in view of the considerations

that" ... an individual must not only participate in or contribute to a

terrorist activity "knO'luingly", his or her actions must also be undertaken

"for the purpose" ... requiring a "higher objective purpose of enhancing the

31

ability of any terrorist group to carry out a terrorist activity", and decided to

keep him away from the community.

As the Canadian Court did in R v Khawaja (supra) by determining

that "... in terrorism cases, denunciation, general deterrence and public

protection should be emphasised over personal deterrence and rehabilitation", the

High Court also placed emphasis on protecting the community by keeping

him away for some time.

We have already held that the High Court had imposed a legally

valid sentence on the 6th Appellant. In examining its propriety after 16

years since its imposition, this Court notes that the sentences imposed by

the High Court contains all the considerations that the common law Courts

have now developed and are applying in sentencing a terrorist and for that

reason could easily be accepted as a sentence that is commensurate with

the act of offending and therefore appropriate under the circumstances.

In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs of

this judgment, it is our considered view that the appeal of the 4th and 5th

Appellants and revision application of the 6th Appellant are devoid of

merit.

Accordingly, the convictions of the 4th, 5th and 6th Appellants and the

sentences imposed on them are affirmed by this Court. 32

In these circumstances, the appeal of the 4th and 5th Appellants are

dismissed. The revision application of the 6th Appellant is also stands

dismissed as he failed to establish any exceptional circumstances In

support of his application
