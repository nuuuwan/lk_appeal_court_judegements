. The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

possession of 26.22 grams of heroin punishable under sec. 54 a (3) of

Act no. 13 of 1984. After trial he was found guilty and sentenced to life

imprisonment.

Two witnesses who went on the raid had given evidence in the

High Court and said they found the appellant in possession of 26.22

grams of heroin. They both have given evidence to state the place from

where he was arrested. The argument of the appellant's counsel was that

notes were not made and that there was no entry regardfng the vehicles

that went with the police team. Notes are kept and brought by the police

witnesses to refresh their memories and if an officer can remember the

incident the notes are not required. The learned counsel for the

respondent stated that there is a note entered to say that the vehicle

assigned to the Keselwatte police was used to carry out the raid.

The learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that

the learned High Court Judge who heard the case was not the Judge who

delivered the judgment and that he has not adopted the evidence led

before his predecessor as per section 48 of the Judicature Ad. The

addresses of the counsels were made before the Judge who delivered

the judgment therefore one can not argue at this moment that the

proceedings were not adopted. Though it has not been put on paper

without the parties agreeing to do so the learned High Court Judge could

not have heard the case.

The learned counsel further argued that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to properly analyse the evidence and thereby the

appellant was deprived of a fair trial. He also stated that the learned High

Court Judge when there was no admission by the appellant has stated

that the Government Analyst's Report marked X in terms of sec. 420 of

Code of Criminal Procedure Act was admitted by the appellant.

He also argued that the inherent improbabilities of the prosecution

case and the per se contradictions of prosecution witness number 1 and

inter se contradictions of prosecution witness number 1 and number 2

were not considered by the learned High Court Judge. The appellant's

counsel also stated that the judgment has been delivered seven months

after the trial was concluded.

When considering the evidence led at the trial we decide that there

is consistent evidence against the appellant which has to be properly

recorded by the High Court. Therefore we decide that this case should

be sent back to the High Court for a retrial.

On the question of retrial the learned President's Counselor for the

appellant cited a number of judgments and argued that this should not go

back for retrial. In Queen vs Jayasinghe 69 NLR 318 and Ratnayake

vs AG 2001 1 SLR 390 it was decided that re trial should not be orderd

due to the length of time. In this case it is not so this is not a very old

case.

In Sujithlal vs AG CA 38/2006 on 20/10/2014 it was held that a

retrial should not be ordered to cover up the failure of the learned High

Court Judge. But in the instant case we are not ordering a retrial to cover

4

';'/:'-

up the failures of the High Court but to record the consistent evidence

against the appellant in the High Court which can not be done in the Court

of Appeal. Since there is consistent evidence against the appellant the

only remedy available is to send the case back to the High Court for a

retrial.

We set aside the judgment dated 09/02/2017 and order the learned

High Court Judge to have the case re tried.
