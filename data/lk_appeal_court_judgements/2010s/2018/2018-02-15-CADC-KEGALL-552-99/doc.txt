Defendants-Respondents

Counsel: Sudarshani Coorey for lb and 19a Defendant-Appellant

L. Amerasinghe for lb, 2b, 3b and 4a Plaintiffs-Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

lb and 19a Defendant Appellant on 10th January 2018

This order pertains to an application made by the lb and 19a Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) for an

order of Court under section 81(9) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 (Partition Law) to declare

that any orders or judgements made by this Court and any step, arguments or proceedings taken

before this Court will not be invalid due to non-appointment of a legal representative to

represent the estate of a deceased party or person in this appeal. In the alternative an order is

sought that any party who claims that a party in this matter has died should produce to this Court

death certificates and other documents necessary for substitution.

The Appellant has in her affidavit sought to explain the background to this application. It is stated

that the 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 2Pt, 22 nd and 24th Defendants-Respondents (Defendants)

have passed away and that except for the 11th and 24th Defendants, who are one and the same,

the Appellant is unaware of the whereabouts of the other deceased parties as their families had

left the village. Accordingly, the Appellant is unable to obtain the death certificates and other

documentation to effect substitution on behalf of the deceased parties.

In this context it is important to consider the provisions of section 81(9) of the Partition Law

which is relied on by the Appellant. It reads as follows:

"Notwithstanding that a party or person has failed to file a memorandum under the

provisions of this section, and that there has been no appointment of a legal

representative to represent the estate of such deceased party or person, any judgment

or decree entered in the action or any order made, partition or sale effected or thing

done in the action shall be deemed to be valid and effective and in conformity with the

provisions of this Law and shall bind the legal heirs and representatives of such deceased

party or person. Such failure to file a memorandum shall also not be a ground for

invalidating the proceedings in such action."

In Chandrasiri v. Abusali et all the Supreme Court held that section 81(9) of the Partition Law has

no retrospective operation. This partition action was filed on 10th July 1967. Hence the

application made by the Appellant for an order of Court under section 81(9) of the Partition Law

No. 21 of 1977 to declare that any orders or judgements made by this Court and any step,

arguments or proceedings taken before this Court will not be invalid due to non-appointment of

a legal representative to represent the estate of a deceased party or person in this appeal must

be rejected on that ground alone.

However, there are other reasons as to why such an order cannot be made by this Court.

There are different statutory provisions which apply when a party dies during the pendency of a

partition action in the District Court or the appeal in the High Court/Court of Appeal/Supreme

Court.

Section 48(1) of the Partition Law as amended states as follows:

"Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory decree

entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered under section

36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may be preferred therefrom,

and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject also to the provisions of

subsection (4) of this section, be good and sufficient evidence of the title of any

person as to any right, share or interest awarded therein to him and be final and

conclusive for all purposes against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title

or interest they have, or claim to have, to or in the land to which such decree

relates and notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof

of title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons concerned are not

parties to the partition action; and the right, share or interest awarded by any such

decree shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified

in that decree.

In this subsection "omission or defect of procedure" includes an omission or

failure -

(a) to serve summons on any party; or

6

I I 1

1 I

(b) to substitute the heirs or legal representatives of a party who dies pending the

action or to appoint a person to represent the estate of the deceased party for the

purposes of the action; or

(c) to appoint a guardian ad litem of a party who is a minor or a person of unsound

mind."

This section applies only to the District Court proceedings and has no application to the High

Court/Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. 2 In Karunawathie v. Piyasena and others3 the

Supreme Court held that when a party to a case had died during the pendency of that case, it

would not be possible for the Court to proceed with that matter without apPointing a legal

representative of the deceased in his place. That was a partition case. However, Chitrasiri J. in W.

Jane Nona v. D. Chalo Singho et al4 held that Karunawathie v. Piyasena and othersS was decided

per incuriam and that Section 48 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 as amended by Act No. 17

of 1997 is drafted to ensure the final and conclusive nature of a decree in a partition action even

if no substitution has been effected to represent a deceased party in such action.

Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code, read with Article 169(2) of the Constitution, states as

follows:

llbid.

"Where at any time after the lodging of an appeal in any civil action, proceeding

or matter, the record becomes defective by reason of the death or change of

status of a party to the appeal, the Court of Appeal may in the manner provided

in the rules made by the Supreme Court for that purpose, determine who, in the

opinion of the court, is the proper person to be substituted or entered on the

record in place of, or in addition to, the party who has died or undergone a change

of status, and the name of such person shall thereupon be deemed to be

substituted or entered of record as aforesaid."

Hence where a party to an appeal in a partition case dies after the lodging of an appeal,

substitution is regulated by Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code read with Rule 38 of the

Supreme Court Rules 1990.6 The purpose or manner of substitution in the Appellate Court is

different from the purpose and manner of substitution in the original court. In the appellate court

unlike in the original court substitution is allowed for a limited purpose of prosecuting or

continuing with the action as the rights of the parties are already determined.7

In view of the different regimes that apply in a partition action or appeal, it is important for a

Court to be appraised of the date on which a party dies. It is only then can a Court decide what

steps, if any, should be taken in the action or appeal.

However, the Appellant has in the written submissions stated that the date of death of the parties

are not known to her.

In the Circumstances, I am of the view that the Appellant must furnish to Court the dates on which

the deceased parties died in order to decide further steps according to law.

Application of the Appellant is rejected without costs.
