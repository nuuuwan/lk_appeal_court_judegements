Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

the Petitioners.

Argued on: 06.06.2018

Written Submissions filed:

by the Respondents on 21.08.2018

by the Petitioners on 31.08.2018

Decided on: 08.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The two petitioners filed this application seeking (a) to quash by

way of writ of certiorari the order of the 2nd respondent marked

P19 whereby 50 containers of sugar were forfeited and (b) to

compel the respondents by way of writ of mandamus to release

to the petitioners the proceeds of the sale of sugar.

The petitioners had earlier filed the writ application No.

686/2007 regarding the same consignment of sugar in which a

3

settlement had been reached to hold a fresh inquiry by the

Customs. Order P19 is consequent to that fresh inquiry.

The main, if not the sole, complaint of the petitioners against the

said inquiry is the active role played by Mr. Saman de Silva-

Deputy Director of Customs, who seized the consignment, at the

aforesaid inquiry. The Inquiring Officer was the 2nd respondent-

Mr. Premaratne-Deputy Director of Customs at that time.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners submits that the

Inquiring Officer was bias and there was a collusion between the

Inquiring Officer and Mr. Saman de Silva.

As seen from P19 and inquiry notes (eg. P17D, P17E, P17F,

P17H, P17I, P17J, P17K), in addition to Mr. Ravindra-Deputy

Superintendent of Customs, Mr. Saman de Silva has also acted

as an Officer Assisting the Inquiring Officer-Mr. Premaratne.

According to P17S, learned counsel for the petitioners who

appeared at the inquiry has unhesitatingly recognized Mr.

Saman de Silva as the Prosecuting Officer.

According to P11-the letter sent by learned Additional Solicitor

General on behalf of the 3rd respondent-Attorney General, the

custom inquiry was directed/instructed to be held forthwith.

Even though the letter is formally addressed to the Director

General of Customs, it has particularly been sent to the

ATTENTION:-Mr. Saman de Silva (DDC). That letter further

makes reference to instructions given over the telephone on

30.10.2014 (which, appears to be instructions given to Mr.

Saman de Silva).

4

I must also add that P11 has been sent with a copy to the

learned counsel for the petitioners upon the request made by the

said counsel by P10 seeking a direction to the 1st respondent to

hold the inquiry within two weeks from that letter.

In that backdrop, in my view, Mr. Saman de Silva had every

right to actively involve in the whole process to make sure that

the inquiry is commenced and concluded expeditiously. I see no

collusion between the 2nd respondent-Inquiring Officer and

Prosecuting Officer-Mr. Saman de Silva.

As seen from P13, at the commencement of the inquiry, learned

counsel for the petitioners has objected the inquiry being held by

Mr. Premaratne on three grounds: (a) notice was delivered on the

24th November 2014 regarding the inquiry to be held on the 26th

November 2014 and there was insufficient time to prepare for

the inquiry; (b) on the 10th November 2014 Mr. Saman de Silva

informed the counsel that Mr. Premaratne would be the

Inquiring Officer and the inquiry would be fixed in four days and

concluded; (c) prior to the commencement of the inquiry Mr.

Premaratne informed Mr. Saman de Silva to brief the case. This

objection has been overruled by the Inquiring Officer-Mr.

Premaratne, which in my view is not unjustifiable.

It is the contention of learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioners that in terms of clause 7.3.1 of the Manual of

Procedure of the Sri Lanka Customs marked P14, if a party

objects as such, the Inquiring Officer has no alternative but to

refer the matter to the Director General of Customs irrespective

5

of the merits of the objection. I am unable to agree. Such a

literal, mechanical interpretation cannot be given to that clause.

In any event, after overruling the objection, the Inquiring Officer,

further accommodating the learned counsel for the petitioners,

has postponed the inquiry until 16.12.2014. As seen from P15(a)

dated 02.12.2014, learned counsel for the petitioner has

thereafter, referring to the said clause, written to the Director

General of Customs to appoint another inquiring officer, but the

Director General of Customs has not thought it fit to accede to

that request.

As learned State Counsel appearing for the respondents

correctly points out, P14 is an internal document which has no

force of law, the compliance of which is desirable but not

mandatory. I must further add that the P14 Manual has been

compiled not to thwart the steady progress of inquiries but to

expedite them.

Let me now state briefly why I say that overruling of that

objection is justifiable. Out of the three grounds, according to

(b) above, on the 10th, learned counsel for the petitioners has

been personally informed by Mr. Saman de Silva himself about

the impending inquiry and even the name of the Inquiring

Officer. If there was a collusion between the Inquiring Officer

and Mr. Saman de Silva, such a voluntary disclosure can never

be expected. This further goes to show that there is no room to

say that notice given on the 24th regarding the inquiry to be held

on the 26th was inadequate. In fact, as I stated earlier, by P10

dated 29.10.2014, learned counsel for the petitioners wanted the

6

inquiry to be commenced within two weeks from that date, and

by P11 dated 04.11.2014 the Customs was directed/instructed

to hold the inquiry forthwith. I must also emphasize that there

is absolutely no irregularity or bias, in the Inquiring Officer

asking the Prosecuting Officer, to brief the prosecution case at

the commencement of the inquiry.

At the inquiry no documents regarding terms of payment,

shipping and CUSDEC have been tendered by the petitioners.

That is the crux of the matter. No proper person has been

identified as responsible for entering 50 containers of sugar to

the harbour. Notwithstanding the position of the petitioners

that the importer was Kala Traders, the contracts relied upon by

the petitioners marked P4(a)-(c) are still unsigned by Kala

Traders; and moreover, a director of Kala Traders, by affidavit

tendered in the earlier case-the precursor-CA (Writ) 686/2007

has disowned any connection whatsoever of Kala Traders to this

50 containers of sugar.

The allegation of the respondents is that the petitioners have

acted in violation of sections 12 and 43 of the Customs

Ordinance, No. 17 of 1869, as amended, which statutory

provisions are fleshed out in schedule B to the Customs

Ordinance read with Extra Ordinary Gazette 1022/06 of

08.04.1998 issued under Import and Export (Control) Act, No.1

of 1969, as amended.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I see no illegality,

irrationality or procedural impropriety of the impugned order.

Application is dismissed with costs.
