DEC1DED ON 18.10.2018

~K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Accused-Applicant-Petitioner has filed a revision application in this court

seeking to set aside the order ffi:ide on 0'6.04.2018, by the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo, refusing to enlarge the Accused-Applicant-Petitioner on bail.

Facts of the case:

The Accused-Applicant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'Petitioner') was

indicted for committing an offence punishable under section 389 of the Penal

-Code. At the conG.1usion of the case, after having heard the submissions made by

the prosecution and defence, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo had . ( -";'l convicted the petitioner by the judgment dated 18.01.2018. Accordingly following

~entences had been imposed on the petition~r; .

j

i) A term of 03 years rigorous imprisonment,

L' ii) A fine of Rs.500,0001- with a. default term of nine months simple

imprisonment,

iii) A compensation of Nine Million' Rupees (09 million) to be paid to PW

01 with a default term of 18 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the petitioner had filed an appeal in this

!: Court on 22.01.2018. Thereafter the petitioner had filed a bail pending Appeal

t . ~ dated 25.01.2018 under section 20(2) of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997. The Learned

,.

Page 3 0:14

'.,

High Court Judge of Colombo has disrr~lssed the said application by the order

$, dated 06.04.2018 due to absence of excepifonal circumstances. .

i

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the petitioner preferred a reVISIOn

application to this Court.

~

In d,e petition, the petitioner has averred ,ihat th~ order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo refusing bail was contrary to law on several grounds and few of

those grounds were reproduced in the written submission as follows;

i) Impugned order dated 06.04.2018 is against the ruling principles of bail,

ii) There is no barrier to grant bail to an accused if the time period to process

the appeal goes for more than the period of imprisonment,

}

iii) Possibility of winning the appe;lby the petitioner is very likely,

f:

iv) The Learned High Court Judgy had failed to consider that petitioner

would not be able to pay the fine and compensation ifhe is kept behind bars,

V) Hon. Attorney General has mad~ a different submission in another case

on the same date.

Upon perusal of the brief, we observe that the petitioner has not submitted the

indictment and the order of the sentence :to this Court. Rule 3 (1) of the Court of

~ Appeal [Appellate Procedure] Rules of 1990 states that;

, .. '

"Every application by way of revisiyn or restitutio in integrum under Article

, 138 of the Constitution shall be ma~1e in like manner together with copies of

" the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents produced), in

the Court of First instance, tribunal or other institution to which the

application relates." ,.

Page 41'of 14

Therefore the petitioner has not complied with the aforesaid rule. It is well settled

; . law that the compliance of rules is imperative and mandatory. However we will not

, dismiss the application in limine since there are several important legal issues to be

addressed.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that after the enactment of

the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997, the SC0.t-'e of granting bail had been drastically

expanded and even non-bailable offences stipulated in Code of Criminal Procedure

Act were considered to be bailable offences as far as the circumstances can be

.' established before Courts. The Learned(! Counsel further submitted that the long

title of the Bail Act is expressly clear as to which group of persons could seek bail

from courts, hence one cannot differentiate an accused-having committed an

offence as a person not qualified to seek..bail. The long title of the Bail Act reads as

follows;

"AN ACT to provide for release on bail of persons suspected or accused of

being concerned in committing or of having committed an offence; to

provide for the granting of anticipatory bail and for matters, connected

therewith or incidental thereto."

The Learned Counsel has submitted the case of Dachchini V. Attorney General

(2005) 2 S. L.R. 152 in which it was held; that,

"By the enactment of the Bail Act the policy in granting bail has undergone

a major change. The rule is the grant of bail. The Rule upholds the values

endorsed in human freedom. The e,:ception is the refusal of bail and reasons-

" should be given when refusing the bail...

Per SRISKANDRAJAH, J: By the enactment of the bail Act there is a major

change in the legislative policy and the Courts are bound to give effect to'

Page 5 of 14

:

this policy. The High Court Judge fn the impugned Order has erred in not

,J taking into consideration the policy; change that has been brought in by the

enactment and mechanically applied the principle that the accused have

failed to show exceptional circumst~nces when this requirement is no more a , . ~.) principle governing bail pending appeal...

Therefore the Learned Counsel contended. that upon the Bail Act coming into

operation in the year 1997, all the decisiofls' on not granting bail before the said Act

,i had become obsolete and no relevance.

However we observe that said judgment qf the Court of Appeal was overruled by

I the Supreme Court judgment of Attorn~ General V. Letchchemi & another . 't!' [S.C. Appeal 13/2006] (2006 B.L.R. 16), in which it was held that,

';

"The presumption of innocence thqt ensures infavour of those suspected or

accused or connected with the conifnission of an offence, ceases to operate

after conviction by a court of comp~tent jurisdiction. "(Emphasis added)

It was further held that,

"Bail after conviction in the High Court referred to in section 333(3) of the

,~' , Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 has been incorporated in

verbatim in Section 20(2) of the Ba~lAct No.30 of 1997. The settled law on

this is that where a section has be~n incorporated in verbatim, governing

, , principles applicable are those co~tained in the principal enactment. The

interpretation of the principal enactment has always held that there must be

exceptional circumstances.

As section 20 of the Bail Act No. 300f 1997 is identical to that contained in

the Code of Criminal Procedure, in',its implementation the earlier restricted

Page 6 of 14

view of the convicted person ha1?!~g t~ disclose exceptional circumstances

for grant of bail must prevail ... " . :.

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera [S.C. Appeal No. 100/2005]

(2006 B.L.R. 12), it was held that,

"The norm is that ba:l after convic~ion is not a matter of right but would be

'1 granted only under exceptional circumstances. "

i.

In the case ofR V. Muthuretty [54 NLR 493] it was held that,

;'.'

"That in bail pending appeal, Cpurt will not grant bail as a rule, bail

granted only in exceptional circum$tances ... "

In the benchmark decision of Ramu Th,amotharampillai V. Attorney General

(2004) 3 Sri. L.R 180, it was held that,

"The decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

, circumstances. But in order that like cases may be decided alike and that

there will be ensured some uniformity of decisions it is necessary that some

guidance should be laid down for the exercise of that discretion. .. "

In the case of P.M.R.H. Indrani Perer2 and 2 others V. P.C.M.M. Fernando

[s.C. Appeal No. 15112011], it was stateq that, . "Broom's' Legal Maxims -1 Oth Edition -at page ~2 sets out the

application of the maxim in Englan~. "Every court is the guardian of its own

records and master of its own pracpce" and where a practice has existed it

" is convenient, except in cases of extreme urgency and necessity, to adhere to

it, because it is the practice, even though no reason can be assigned for it,',

J. Page 7 of 14

for an inveterate practice in the law generally stands upon principles that are founded in justice and convenience. "

. The Supreme Court has taken the view that bail should not be granted as a right for . I a person who was convicted by a competeht Court. Therefore now it is settled law

, :,]. that an applicant does not enjoy the same p~ivilege of an ordinary person, maybe in

-I the capacity as a suspect, once a competerit court decides his guilt. Accordingly we

reject the above contention of the Leamed;Counsel for the petitioner.

The Learned Counsel for the petitionerdn his second ground of revision has

averred that in the event of imposing a short period of imprisonment (like 2- t'

3years), there is no barrier to grant bail to an accused if the process of the appeal

could consume a much longer time. The :,Ceamed Counsel has submitted the case

of Ediriweera V. Attorney General (2006) 1 Sri L.R. 25 to support said

contention.

However it is imperative to note that said Judgment was overruled by the Supreme

;i Court in the Appeal of Attorney General V. Ediriweera [S.C. Appeal No . . ',

i 100/2005] (2006 B.L.R. 12). Accordingly;'we are inclined to follow the Supreme

Court Judgment instead of the factual findings of the majority decision of Court of

Appeal in the said Ediriweera case.

In the case of Harbhajan Singh V. State of Punjab (1977) CrLR 14~4, it was

held that,

"The factors which the Appellate Court is to consider in an application for

bail pending appeal were ... (b) Whether circumstances are such as likely to

delay the decision of the appeal for' an unreasonable time. It would afford

scant satisfaction to the accused t{ after serving their full or substantial

.~: portion of their sentence, their appeal succeeds and they are merely

Page 8 oJ 14

acquitted oj the charge. This JacM,. cannot be ignored and should be one oj

-. the considerations Jor granting bail... "

The Learned SSC for the Responttent has submitted that the trial Court has

managed to prepare the appeal brief froni the trial brief which consisted over 1500

pages (as per the Paragraph 10 of the petition) within 07 mor.ths from the

conviction and said appeal brief of the instant case has already been sent to this

Court on 09.07.2018. It was further submitted' that the said appeal of the petitioner , '\ is now listed under case No. CAJ8112018'.

We are of the view that in the present system of crir:1inal justice we do not see

prolonged delays in preparing Appeal bri.efs as it used to be. Therefore it would not

be appropriate to follow this ground (in modern day context especially when

judicial officers and staff in Courts an:!;i-taking every possible step to expedite the

.. '1 trial and appeal proceedings.

I,

At this stage we will consider final grou,nd of exceptional circumstance since it is

quite similar to above said second groltI1d which addresses the time factor in the

! ' appeal process. The Learned Counsel' for the petitioner has submitted that th~ , double standard taken by the Hon. Attorney General in two places on the same dat,y

should be considered as an exception~l circumstance. Accordingly the Learned

Counsel contended that the Learned sse for the respondent has submitted before

this Court that 03 year period of sentencing was no wayan exceptiomil ground t6

grant bail and thereafter the same Senior State Counsel had gone to Case No.

11309 in the Magistrate's Court of HOillf;gama and had taken an opposite view.

Answering the said contention of the Learned Counsel for petitioner, the Learned

SSC for the respondent has submitted that circumstances of the two cases are

different. The accused in the Magistrates Court of Homagama was sentenced to a

, I Page '9 of 14

term of six months whereas the petitioner of instant case was sentenced to a term of 3 years. Accordingly we are of the view that it is quite difficult to conclude an

appeal within a period of 6 months no rt~atter how expeditious the current appeal

.~ process is. Therefore the time factor should be considered comparative to the term

of imprisonment.

, In the aforesaid case of Ediriweera [s.c. Appeal No. 100/2005], it was held that,

~,' ,

"Delay is always a relative term and the question to be considered is not

whether there was mere explicable delay, as when there is a backlog of

cases, but whether there has been, excessive or oppressive delay and this

always depends on the facts and cirpumstances of the case ... "

Further we observe that there is a term. of 9 months imprisonment as the default

sentence for the fine and a telm of 18 months imprisonment as the default sentence

for the compensation. The petitioner was sentenced to a term of 03 years rigorous

imprisonment for the substantive charge> Therefore in the eVEnt of failure to pay

the said fine and the compensation the t'o.tal period of imprisonment would be 5

years and 03 months. The petitioner had not paid the said fine or the compensation

even on the date of the bail order of the Learned High Court Judge. In such a

background, where the fine and the compensation to be paid is a huge amount,

there is a likelihood of absconding without paying the same.

1 We will consider the third and fourth grounds of exceptional circumstances, as

averred by the petitioner, together. Accordingly in the petition which was

submitted to this Court, the petitioner has averred that the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo had failed to consider~~hat the petitioner will not be able to pay

the fine and the compensation if he is ker,t behind bars. However upon perusal of

the petition submitted to the High Court> we observe that the petitioner had not

Page 10 of 14

< .

averred that particular ground as an exceptional circumstance. Therefore it is unjustifiable to state that the Learned Hi?h Court Judge had failed to consider such

ground when in fact the petitioner had not averred the same before High Court.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that possibility of the

petitioner winning the appeal should be considered as an exceptional circumstance

to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this court. Accordingly the Learned

1 Counsel has pointed out errors in the Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 18.01.2018 and has submitted that the petitioner has a prima facie case to get

him acquitted in the appeal as the Learned High Court Judge had faile~ to

appreciate the civil aspects cf original qase. The petitioner himself has submitted

'J, that trial proceedings (Appeal brief) consist of over 1500 pages. If that is to be true,

it will be unreasonable for us to conclude that there is no prima facie case against

the petitioner, merely because he states the same, without taking a single glance at

the appeal brief. However, we are not bound to consider the merits of the main

appeal under a revision application seekirlg for bail.

The Learned SSC has submitted; that there is another pending trial against the

petitioner in Colombo High Court under case No. HC 5828/2011 where the

petittoner was charged with another ac6used for cheating and misappropriating a

sum of six million rupees from the same complainant of case No. HC 5793/2011.

The Learned High Court Judge had correctly considered this fact in refusing the

bail application.

The Lealned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted the mental health of the son ; . of the petitioner to be considered as an e~:;eptional circumstance.

Page 11 of 14 .,.

However in the case of Ranil Charuk~ KuJathunga V. AG rCA (PHC) APN

13412015], it was held that,

"The petitioner submits several grounds to consider bail. The Petitioner

states that he is a married person with two school going children. The'

persons getting married and havtng children is not an exceptional ground. It

is the normal day to day life of the people. "

~~

I We observe that the Learned High Court .Judge of Colombo has held as follows;

brief)

In the case of Dharmaratne and anothe~ V. Palm paradise Cabanas Ltd and'

others (2003) 3 SLR 25, it was held that by Amarathunga J,

"Thus the existence of exceptional iC;ircumstances is the process by which the

Court selects the case in respect. of which this extra ordinary method of

rectification should be adopted"

In Attorney General V. Gunawardena '(1996) 2 S.L.R. 149 it was held that,

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice

,I .,

r and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of griEvances of a party ... "

\ '.

Page 12 of 14

Tn the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L R 284, it was held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionmyjurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure 0.( justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irre[J7:'larity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

I . would have shocked the conscience of court."

Considering above, we see no reason to revise the order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo. We are oftr\e view that the petitivner has failed to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances to th'e satisfaction of this Court in order to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction. . ' Therefore this revision application is dismissed without costs.
