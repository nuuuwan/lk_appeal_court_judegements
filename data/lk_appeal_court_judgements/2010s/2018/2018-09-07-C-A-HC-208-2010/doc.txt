ACHALA WENGAPPULI T.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General for committing murder of

Senanayaka Nawalage Dona Joslin Senanayaka on or about 10th May 2006

before the High Court of Ampara. The Appellant elected to be tried

without a jury. At the end of the trial, during which the prosecution and

the Appellant presented evidence in support of their respective cases, he

was convicted for murder and was sentenced to death.

In challenging the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant relied

on several grounds of appeal which could be simplified into two main

grounds. Firstly, the Appellant contended that the trial Court had

2

erroneously found him guilty on unreliable evidence led by the

prosecution and secondly it erroneously rejected the evidence presented

by the Appellant under oath.

The Appellant strenuously challenged the reliance on the evidence

of the prosecution, particularly as to the credibility of witness Vinitha who

claims that the Appellant has admitted to her of causing death of the

deceased. In addition, the Appellant placed reliance of the inconsistencies

among the prosecution witnesses; in relation to the time of death, of

providing information to Police and the failure to call de facto wife of the

Appellant, who lived in the adjacent house to that of the deceased at the

time of the incident.

In relation to the rejection of his evidence, the Appellant contended

that the trial Court was in error when it imposed an evidentiary burden of

corroborating his evidence in relation to the defence of alibi.

The prosecution primarily relied on a confession made by the

Appellant to witness Vinitha admitting causing death of the deceased. In

addition, it also relied on several items of circumstantial evidence, in

support of the case it presented before the trial Court.

It is appropriate at this stage to refer to the case for the prosecution

at least in summary form.

3

The Appellant had a de facto relationship with the daughter of the

deceased, who lived adjacent to the guest house operated by the deceased

called /I Suwa Sevana". He was initially employed by the deceased to carry

out repair work to the roof of the guest house and as his relationship grew

with her destitute daughter, he settled with her supporting financially and

undertaking various jobs in the construction sites around Ampara town

area.

Witness Vinitha, came to Ampara town on her own with a troubled

past, found shelter in the house of one Singer Some. Although pregnant for

5 months, she had to provide services as a sex worker at the insistence of

person called Singer Some. She then got friendly with the deceased who

lived alone, and was a regular visitor to her lodge. At the time of the

deceased's death, Vinitha has rented out a place and lived with her infant

and her own mother. She continued her employment as a sex worker and

was known to Sub Inspector Saliya Gamage who was attached to

intelligence unit of Ampara Police. She was one of his informants.

Vinitha's regular acquaintance with the deceased and her daughter

led to a friendly relationship with the Appellant. She treated him as a

younger brother and was fond of him in memory of her late brother. She

regularly mediated and provided counselling to the Appellant when he

had problems in his relationship with de facto partner, Rasika/Ajantha .

4

About 2 days prior to the death of the deceased, the Appellant had

assaulted his partner. Vinitha was informed of this and she had spoken to

Rasika about it. On the day of the incident, the Appellant arrived at

Vinitha' 5 place early in the morning. He claimed that he did not feel like

going to work and had switched off his mobile phone. He played with

Vinitha's child for some time and then went away. Towards midday, she

heard a screech of the Appellant's blue colour moped cycle. He came in

and sat near her. He then wanted to convey her something important.

Vinitha thought it's about his problematic relationship with his partner

Rasika.

But the Appellant got the witness to swear on her child to keep it as

a secret and revealed that he had killed the deceased by throttling her with

his hands. He described how he got hold of the deceased. According to the

Appellant, he told the deceased, Rasika told him to meet her with regard to

the completion of remaining work on toilet and having followed her, he

had throttled her in the room near to the toilet. He had the clothing worn

by the deceased at the time of her death removed and had it in a parcel.

Vinitha told him to throw it to the canal. He then went away.

The witness was distressed and was in a dilemma after hearing of

the killing. She decided to inform SI Gamage about this incident, against

advice of her mother. SI Gamage received a call from Vinitha at 1.00 p.m.

and was told that the deceased was killed by the Appellant. He

immediately alerted the officers of the crimes branch of Ampara Police and

visited the crime scene. He found the back door was unlocked and the

5

deceased was on the bed wearing a yellow skirt and a night dress. The

skirt was raised leaving her body half naked. The cassette radio was on

with its sound set in very high volume. The front door of the house

remained locked from inside. When he was at the crime scene, the

Appellant had arrived there and was arrested for the murder.

One of the neighbours of the deceased, Kanthilatha, saw the deceased

wearing a black skirt covering her bust at about 11.30 in the morning and

at that time she had applied some medication to the upper part of her

body. They chatted at the rear of her house and when the bell rang, the

deceased went in to check. The witness saw the back door being closed.

She heard sound of running water and the radio set switched on. When

her son returned at about 1.00 p.m. she learned from him that the deceased

was killed. Her son, Sampath returned home at about 1.45 p.m. and was

approached by a policeman who disclosed information about the death of

the deceased. He had seen the Appellant among the police officers who

have already arrived at the deceased's house.

The Appellant had injuries on his face and the medical officer who

examined him is of the opinion that they were fresh injuries and could

have been caused by finger nails.

Medical evidence also revealed that the death of the deceased was

due to manual strangulation and the external injuries to her neck and the

6

corresponding internal injuries, especially to the hyoid cartilage, confirm

the fact that pressure was applied to her throat, resulting a necessarily fatal

injury. There were several injuries around the neck of the deceased.

In the light of the evidence referred to above it is reasonable to

expect the Appellant to challenge the acceptance of most damning item of

evidence, his confession, in appeal, seeking to vitiate his conviction. The

contention of the Appellant that it is improbable for him to make a

confession to Vinitha, with whom he had only a limited relationship and

known as a person visited the deceased lodging. In addition, the Appellant

sought to shake her credibility placing reliance on her troubled past,

working as a sex worker and the mental disorder she was treated with.

The troubled history of Vinitha which eventually led to her seeking

shelter and employment in Ampara is revealed in great detail during her

examination in chief itself. She candidly admitted that she was treated for

mental ailment suffered due to an abortion. However, this background has

little or no relevance as to her credibility when her reasons for such a

troubled past are considered. An attempt was made by the Appellant that

the learned trial Judge was overtly sympathetic towards the witness by

equating her to destitute Patachara from Buddhist literature, which in fact

only a quotation from the submissions of the learned State Counsel.

It is significant to note that during her lengthy cross examination,

only two minor omissions were marked. There was no contradictions

marked either from her statement or deposition in relation to the fact that 7

the Appellant made a confession and on its contents. On the contrary,

there is clear evidence that no sooner she heard the confession, she

conveyed it to Police through her mobile phone, a fact confirmed by SI

Gamage, which supports the position that she made a spontaneous and

consistent claim of admission of guilt by the Appellant. Vinitha did not

visit the crime scene. But she gave description of how the death of the

deceased was committed by throttling the neck, which in line with the

opinion of the medical officer, that the death of the deceased was due to

manual strangulation. She described the place where the dead body was,

and the Police witnesses have confirmed that it was lying in the room next

to the toilet. The only way she could describe these, confirms that she was

made aware of them by the Appellant himself when he made the

confession. Of course, he took the precaution of getting her to swear on her

child wanting her not to reveal it to anyone. She explained her reasons for

going back on this promise. She decided to pass that information, to the

Police understandably with reluctance by weighing over loyalties. She was

so distraught that the Appellant had killed the deceased, she banged his

head twice on the handle of his moped. Naturally it was a difficult

decision for her and she felt as if she had surrendered her own child to

authorities.

The claim that making a confession to Vinitha is not probable by the

Appellant, is apparently based on the evidence he presented before the

trial Court. In his evidence, the Appellant maintained that she was a mere

acquaintance and thereby downplayed any significant role attributable to

Vinitha in the sequence of events. However, this is not a position put to

Vinitha and throughout her evidence she maintained that she had very

8

close emotional relationship with him and treated him like her own

younger brother. There was no denial that she knew the Appellant's

relations with Rasika had soured in the last two days. Vinitha claimed that

she mediated on behalf of the Appellant.

Considering their relationship, it is very probable that the Accused

turned to the only woman he could rely on to find solace by confessing to

what he did and to seek her support to get away from the inevitable

consequences. Hence, the claim by the Appellant that it is an improbability

is devoid of any merit.

Another factor that supports the making of confession is, that the

Appellant returned to the compound where the dead body was, from

Vinitha's place, with the belief that he would not be betrayed by her, only

to find the Police who had already arrived there upon her information.

The other inconsistency highlighted by the Appellant is the evidence

In relation to the colour of clothing worn by the Appellant. Witness

Kantilatha spoke of a black colour skirt worn by the deceased when she

was last seen by her, just before she entered her house. The dead body was

clad in a yellow skirt and a night dress, according to the medical and

Police witnesses. This contradiction is easy to explain as Vinitha says the

Appellant admitted that he had removed clothing worn by the deceased

9

when she died and had them in a parcel with him when he arrived at her

place.

These considerations amply demonstrate that the Appellant had in

fact made an unqualified admission of committing the death of the

deceased to witness Vinitha.

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance makes such confessionary

statements, admissible evidence against its maker, provided that the

circumstances under which it was made does not offend its conditions.

There is clear evidence before the trial Court that it was voluntarily made

by the Appellant, quite spontaneously when he arrived at Vinitha's house.

Of course, he took the precaution of getting her assurance that she would

not reveal it to anyone, which in turn, supportive of the fact that it was

made voluntarily. Therefore, the confession of the Appellant has been

rightly admitted by the trial Court and considered against him in support

of the prosecution case.

In Nagamani Theivendran v Attorney General S.C Appeal No.

65/2000 SCM of 16.10.2002, Ismail J, with the agreement of Wigneswaran J,

adopted the reasoning of a judgment of the Supreme Court of India

(Shankaria v State of Rajasthan AIR 1978 SC 1248), where it was held that

in placing reliance on a confession the Court must apply following two

tests;

(i) Whether the confession was perfectly voluntary?

10

(ii) If so, whether it is true and trustworthy?

In describing the second test, the Court further expanded its scope

as it held that;

"The Court could carefully examine the confession and compare it

with the rest of the evidence, in the light of the surrounding

circumstances and probabilities of the case. If on such an

examination and comparison the confession appears to be a

probable catalogue of events and naturally fits in with the rest of

the evidence and the surrounding circumstances, it may be taken

to have satisfied the second test."

However, Ismail J also endorsed the view adopted by the Court of

Appeal, that in relation to confessions there is a "presumption that a person

would not make an admission again his interests unless it were true."

When the contents of the confession and the surrounding

circumstances under which it was made are considered against the back

drop of the other items of circumstantial evidence that had been placed

before the trial Court by the prosecution, we are of the considered view

that the confession of the Appellant has satisfied these two tests beyond a

reasonable doubt.

11

The other basis on which the Appellant sought to challenge the

validity of his conviction and sentence was that the trial Court had

imposed a burden on him to establish his defence of alibi.

It is evident from the journal entries that the indictment was served

on the Appellant on 29th September 2010. With the passing of Criminal

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 14 of 2005, Section 126 of the Code

was amended by insertion of Section 126A, imposing a duty on an accused

to notify that he wishes to adduce evidence in support of the defence of

alibi, after satisfying certain conditions. There is no indication that the

Appellant had complied with the provisions of this Section in leading

evidence of his alibi. However, the Appellant in his evidence stated that

the Police had took him to several shops in Ampara town to check on his

claims that he was making certain purchases during the relevant time.

Nonetheless, the trial Court has considered his evidence on his defence of

alibi and rejected the same owing its inherent inconsistencies and

improbabilities. One such improbability the trial Court had emphasised is

that the Appellant could have called the shop assistants who he claims to

have served him. It is this observation that the Appellant complaints as

having imposed an evidentiary burden on him.

This statement in the Judgment could not be ripped off from the

context in which it was stated by the trial Court. The Appellant, during his

cross examination, stated in evidence what the shop assistants said the

Police when they took him there to verify his claim. What those shop

assistants said the Police was rightly excluded by the trial Court upon the

basis of hearsay. To render that evidence admissible, the Appellant needed

to rely on the direct evidence of those shop assistants which he failed to 12

do. It is in this context that the trial Court has commented on his failure to

call them. It is very relevant to note in this context that when the Appellant

cross-examined investigating officers, he did not suggest to them that he

was taken to these shops and that his claim of alibi was verified in their

presence. Further his claim is that he made certain purchases of some

hardware items on the request of his de facto partner at these shops and he

handed the receipts confirming the purchases over to her.

When the inquiring police officers have questioned the Appellant at

the crime scene, Rasika was present. If he made a reference to his receipts,

the investigators could have easily obtained them and verified. In the light

of this, the trial Court justifiably held that the claim of alibi was not

consistently made and proceeded to reject it.

Similarly, the Appellant sought to explain the InjurIes that were

noted on him by stating that he suffered them when engaged in some

repair work. However, this position was never put to the medical officer

when he gave evidence that there were fresh injuries noted on the

Appellant, which are consistent with finger nail scratches.

The trial Court had rejected the evidence of the Appellant as not

credible due to the said infirmities and held that the prosecution has

proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It was mindful of the legal

principle that in taking up the defence of alibi, the Appellant need not

proved anything. Having considered the evidence in its entirety we are in

full agreement with the view held by the trial Court that the Appellant is

guilty of murder.

,

Accordingly, the judgment and the sentence imposed on the

Appellant is affirmed. The appeal of the Appellant is therefore dismissed.
