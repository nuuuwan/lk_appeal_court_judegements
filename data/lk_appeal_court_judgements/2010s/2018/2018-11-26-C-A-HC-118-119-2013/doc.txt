A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the 1 S\ 2nd and 3rd Appellants) were indicted on 3 counts namely, for causing the

death of William Hettiarachchi, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the

Penal Code, as count 1, the robbery of a Van belonging to Mapatunage Wilson

Wijesinghe, an offence punishable under Section 383 of the Penal Code as count

3

2, and retention of the said Van knowin~ it ~o be stolen property, an offence

pUl'1ishable under Section 394 of the Penal Code, as count 3.

At the conclusion of the trial the Learned High Court Judge convicted the

Accused-Appellants on all charges and were sentenced to death on count 1, and

imposed 20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/- each with a

default sentence of 5 years imprisonment, on count 2. There was no sentence

imposed on count 3.

According to the prosecution, on 25/08/1996, a dead body of an

unidentified person had been found op. the Aguruwella - A vissawella Road, which

was later identified as that of the deceased, William Hettiarachchi.

On 06/09/1996, the 1 st and 2nd Appellants were arrested while they were

seated in a Van in the Ruwanwella Police" Area. At the time of detection, the 3 rd

Appellant had approached the parked van. The police have recovered two knives

concealed in the Van in which the 1 st and 2nd Appellants were seated. A purse had

been recovered with several personal documents belonging to the deceased from

the possession of the 3rd Appellant.

The prosecution case is based on 3 incidents which took place in separate

locations.

Firstly, the body of the deceased is found on 25/08/1996, in an isolated

place at Habaragala in the Ruwanwella police area.

Secondly, the 1S\ 2nd and 3rd Appellants are arrested on 06/09/1996, by the

Bandaragama police. The I st and 2nd Appellants while seated in a van, the 3rd when

approaching the Van.

Thirdly, the 1 st Appellant entrusted a van to PW6, to be re-painted.

I will now evaluate the relevant evidence.

According to Sunil Russell Kumara (PW4), on 24/08/1996, around 10 p.m.,

the 1 st Appellant had walked to his house stating that they were returning from Sri

Pada. The next morning, Russel Kumara on his way to work had seen the 1st

Appellant and another unidentified person in a white Van parked about a quarter

of a mile away from his house. When he inquired, the 1 st Appellant had told him

that he had slept the previous night in the Van. In his evidence this witness failed

to positively identify the van he had seen that morning.

Sisira Kumara, (PW6) in his evidence states that, a person .like the 1st

Appellant had come to him to get a vehicle re-painted. Resorting to a dock

identification, this witness has repeatedly stated to Court that a person like the 15t

Appellant brought the Van in question to be re-painted. Since identity is in issue,

the ability to have positively identified the 15t Appellant for the first time, in the

5

dock, after a lapse of several years, is certainly questionable. The 2nd Appellant

was not identified by this witness.

Professor Ian Dennis in his book titled, The Law of Evidence (3rd Edition),

at page 274, has this to say about dock identifications;

"the term "dock identification" refers to the procedure whereby a

witness is asked whether he or she can see in the courtroom the

person who committed the offence, and the witness then identifies the

defendant in the dock. It has been recognized for many years that

such identifications may be very unsatisfactory where identity is in

dispute. "

In this case further caution is necessary, since the witness refers to the 1st

accused as a person "like the 1 st appellant".

The counsel for the Appellants have referred to the case of Kekulkotuwage

Don Anton Gratien Vs. The Attorney General (CA 226/2007 decided on

01107/2010), in a similar situation, where the witness could not affirmatively

identify the accused, the Court held, that it was unsafe to act on such evidence to

convict the accused.

According to Sub Inspector Pradeep Ananda Silva (PW12), the 1st and 2nd

Appellants were arrested while seated in a Van parked in an isolated place in the

6

Bandaragama police division. According.to his evidence the 3rd Appellant who

was arres~ed at the same place was in the poss'ession of a pu~se which contained a

photograph, an Identity Card and documents belonging to the deceased.

According to the evidence of the Commissioner of Motor traffic (PW22),

the registration number of the Van taken into custody did not correspond with the

engine number. It is also in evidence that the registration documents recovered

from the Van did not correspond with the said Van. However, there is no

satisfactory identification of the Van, by PW6, which is alleged to have been given

by the 1 st Appellant to be re-painted, or a positive identification of the 1st

Appellant by this witness as the person who brought the Van to be re-painted. The

only reference to the 2nd Appellant is that, he is the brother of the 1 st Appellant and

was seated in the Van at the time of arrest.

Two knifes have been recovered on statements obtained from the 1 st and 2nd

Appellant's.

In the case of Devidas Vs. State of Maharashtra, 1982 Cr LJ 2189, 2193

(1981) Bom Cr 577, it was held that,

"the mere discovery by the accused cannot be said to be of any legal

consequence, if it is not preceded by an informative statement on the

part of the accused".

According to evidence, a knife had been concealed between the upholstery

and the roof of the Van and a second knife concealed inside the rear frame of the

Van. The discovery of fact with regard to the information given by the 1 st and 2nd

accused are marked as P13a and P14,a, respectively, in which the 2nd accused state,

"on instructions given by my brother I removed the rear upholstery and concealed

it. I can show it to you", with no reference with regard to any discovery of fact.

Therefore, the fact discovered cannot be considered as consequent to the statement

given by the accused led in evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance,

with regard to any discovery of fact. The discovery of the knifes were made 10

days after the recovery of the dead -body. It is also observed that the information

leading to the discovery was made after the alleged re-painting of the Van.

Therefore, we are of the view that the said statement allegly made by the accused,

and led in evide'nce is not protected under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

When evaluating evidence against the 3rd Appellant the learned, Trial Judge

has concluded that the items of evidence belonging to the deceased, recovered

from the possession of the 3rd Appellant was within the knowledg~ of all the

accused. This is on the basis that the 3rd Appellant was in the company of the 1 st

and 2nd Appellants at the time of arrest. We find that there is no basis on which the

learned trial judge could have arrived at such a conclusion. Such adverse

8

inferences cannot only cause prejudice to the accused but also attach undue weight

to the prosecution case.

We also observe that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

the dock statement given by the Appellant's in its proper legal context,

considering the evidence led by the prosecution.

In S.H. Badurudeen Vs. Hon Attorney General CA. 16712006, decided on

2310212010, the court held that,

"it is trite law that when an accused sets up the defence of denial,

there is no burden on the acc-used to prove the truth of his version

and it is more than sufficient to create merely a reasonable doubt on

the prosecution case ".

In the case of The Queen vs. M.G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 at 351, it was

held that,

"Suspicious circumstances do flot establish guilt. Nor does the proof

of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of

its burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give or call evidence ....

The burden of establishing circumstances which not only establish

the accused IS guilt but are also inconsistent with his innocence

9

remains on the prosecution througkout the trial and is the same in a

case of circumstantial evidence as in.a case of direct evidence. J1

The prosecution case is based on circumstantial evidence gathered from

three separate and distinct events: However, it is observed that the evidence

presented before Court lies in limbo, with no nexus between the accused and the

incriminating evidence. Accordingly, the totality of evidence before Court does

not lead to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt and to the irresistible inference

and conclusion that it was the Accused-Appellants who inflicted the fatal injuries

on the deceased or to the robbery of a van.

Therefore, for all the above reasons, we hold that the impugned judgment

dated 15/07/2013, cannot be upheld. Accordingly, we decide to set aside the

conviction and the sentence of the Learned High Court Judge and acquit the

Accused-Appellants.

Appeal allowed.
