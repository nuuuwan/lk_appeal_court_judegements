The Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner has filed a revision application in this court to set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge in Case No.932/Rev dated

10.03.2018 ::mcl to set 'l~ide the order of the Learned MagistrZl1f' ')f Elpi:l):a ill the case No. 70009 dated 20.10.2015 ordering the confiscation of the vehicle bearing registration No. SPLB 0492. At the stage of argument it was agreed to conclude the case by way of filing Written Submissions and both parties had agreed to abide by the same.

Facts of the case

The Accused (a person named R.W.Wasantha Kumara) was charged in the

Magistrate Court of Elpitiya for transporting Sand without a valid permit on

01.12.2010, an offence punishable in terms of section 20 read with the sections 40,

40(a) and 40(b) of the Forest Ordin.::.ucc. Since the Accused pleaded guilty to the

said charge, a fine of Rs.1 0, 000 and Rs. 4,000 crown cost were imposed on him

(Case No. 67582). The claimant petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

3

i.--//

...

submitted that being the registered owner of the said motor Lorry, he had

immediately terminated the service of the Accused as Driver of the Lorry and the

Accused had lodged a complaint against him at the Labour Department claiming

compensation. Subsequent to the Order of the Magistrate court, the Learned

Magistrate of Elpitiya proceeded to hold an inquiry for the purpose of deciding

whether the said vehicle allegedly used for committing of the offence should be

confiscated or not.

While the Inquiry was pending, the vehicle was released to the Petitioner on a

Bond and he submitted that he had to re-employ the Accused as per the requests of

his parents. He further submitted that he had warned the Accused not to use the

vehicle for any illegal purpose and he closely monitored the mOVements of the

Accused.

However, on 22.06.2011 the Driver (The Accused) had been again arrested by the

Officers of the Forest Der:'a:tnlcnt for transporting Bamboo valued at Rs. 15,37S

without a valid permit. Accordingly, he had been charged for the second time

before the Magistrate court of Elpitiya in terms of section 25 read with sections 40

and 40(a) of the Forest Ordinance as Amended. While the confiscation inquiry of

the second incident (Case No.70009) was pending, the Learned Magitrate of

Elpitiya concluded the coniiscation inquiry of first incident (Case No. 67582) and

made an order dated 02.03.2012 to confiscate the said vehicle. Being aggrieved by

that order, the Petitioner made a revision application to the High Court of

Balapitiya and the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya had ordered for a fresh

confiscation inquiry to be held by another Magistrate. Accordingly a fresh inquiry

'vV(lS held by another tv1agistrate Dppoin1ed hy the Judicial Service Commission and ',., ,.

the Learned Magistrate by his order dated 21.11.2014 had released the vehicle to

the Petitioner having satisfied that the Petitioner had taken all the precautions to

4

prevent the vehicle being used for any illegal purpose. A lengthy trial was held

against the Accused with regard to the second incident (Case No.70009) and the

Learned Magistrate of Elpitiya had found the Accused guilty of an offence

punishable under of section 25 read with sections 40 and 40(a) of the Forest

Ordinance and imposed a fine of Rs.IOO, 000 if default 06 months simple

imprisonment and a sentence of 01 year imprisonment suspended for 05 years.

Again a confiscation inquiry was held and the Learned Magistrate pronounced

order dated 20.10.2015 to confiscate the alleged vehicle and to sell it by public

auction. Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner filed a revision

application bearing No REV 932116 before the High Court of Balapitiya which

was dismissed by the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya.

The Petitioner being aggrieved by the said dismissal of the High Court and the

Order of the Learned Magistrate of Elpitiya vvishes to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of this court.

In the case of Manawadu v The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30, it was held

that

" ... if the mvner on the balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was committed

without his knmvledge nor he lvas privy to the commission of the offence then the

vehicle has to be released to the owner ... "

It is settled law that the burden is casted on the claimant to prove that the he took

all precautions to prevent the otTence being committed and such burden needs to be

discharged on a balance of probability.

In the aforementioned Manawadu case, Sharavananda, C.J, stated that,

5

II

..

.. ... Dixon c.J., in Commissioner of Police v. Tanes(1957-58) 68 CLR 383,

underlined this canon of interpretation:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can be punished or

prejudiced in his person or his property by any judicial or quasi-judicial

procedure, he must be afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

It is important to note that the Petitioner was afforded with this opportunity of

being heard by the Learned Magistrate of Elpitiya and the confiscation order was

made only after considering the evidence placed before him.

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva, Vs. P.B. De Silva rCA (PBC) 86/971

Sisira De Abrew, J has stated that,

"For these reasons I hold that giving mere instructions is not sl{tJicient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were in

fact given and that she rook eve,y endeavor to implement the instructions ... !f

Accordingly we are of the view that giving mere verbal instructions to the driver

by the owner of the vehicle does not sufficiently establish the precautionary

measures. It is pertinent to note that the vehicle was previously involved in another

offence as well. Therefore the degree of preventive measures that should have been

taken by the owner of the vehicle to prevent an offence being committed again

using the vehicle is comparatively higher. But the Petitioner had re employed the

Accused driver after giving mere verbal instructions which in fact is insufficient to

establish, on a balance of probability, that he has taken every possible precaution to

prevent an offellce being committed.

6

/ I,

Considering the above, this court is of the view that the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya affirming the order of the Learned Magistrate of Elpitiya is in accordance with the law. Thus, we see no ground to interfere with the decisions of both the High Court and the Magistrate Court.

Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
