This is an appeal against the judgment of the Learned District Judge of

Matale (dated 12.02.1999) in respect of a partition action Number P

2143. The Plaintiff-Appellant instituted this action seeking to partition

the land called "Maussagala Rubberwatte" more fully described in the

schedule to the plaint as per the pedigree set out in the plaint.

According to the Plaintiff-Appellant's pedigree Segu Mohammed Lebbe,

Rahuma Umma and Kassim Mohammed Sheriff were the original

owners of the land described in the schedule to the plaint as per the

pedigree set out in the plaint.

According to the Plaintiff-Appellant's pedigree an undivided 1/3 share

originally belonged to Segu Mohammed Lebbe transferred to five

persons namely Abdul Aziz, Sulaiman Taufiq, Mohammed Rauf, Jinnah

Umma and Abuza Umma and after the demise of the Segu Mohammed

Lebbe his heirs and the above said five persons transferred their

undivided shares to Pragnadasa by way of Deed bearing No. 484 dated

17.09.1979 marked as P 9.

In addition to another person called Rahuma Umma who own

undivided 1/3 share of the same land above described transferred her

rights to Pragnadasa through Deed marked as P 9. Then Pragnadasa

who transferred his rights to the Plaintiff-Appellant, 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants-Respondents.

Later Rahuma Umma and Kassim Mohammed Sheriff transferred their

undivided 2 Roods to 5th Defendant-Respondent. And then Kassim

Mohammed Sheriff had transferred his undivided 2 Acres 2 Roods 20

Perches to the 4th Defendant-Respondent.

The land called "Maussagala Rubberwatte" more fully described in the

schedule to the plaint is in extent of 10 Acres. But according to the

Preliminary Plan 8047 dated 24.08.1994 (Marked as 'X') prepared by

the Licensed Surveyor J. M J ayasekara was in extend of 9 Acres 3

Roods 32 Perches consisting of Lots 1,2,3 and 4.

The Learned District Judge of Mattale delivered his judgment on

12.02.1999 admitting the corpus only Lots 1, 2 and 3 which had been

shown in the Preliminary Plan and he has allocated the shares to the

parties as follows:

Plaintiff-Appellant undivided

1st Defendant-Respondent undivided

2nd Defendant-Respondent undivided

OA 1R 19.33P

1 A 3 R 19.33 P

1A 3R 19.33P

3rd Defendant-Respondent undivided

4th Defendant-Respondent undivided

2 A 0 R 38.00 P

2 A 2 R 20.00 P

(Page at 165)

The Plaintiff-Appellant being dissatisfied with the Judgment of the

Learned District Court judge appealed and prayed before this Court to

set aside the judgment of the Learned District Judge on the basis that

there is an error in the calculation of the shares by the Learned District

Judge of Matale.

It is to be noted that according to the Plaintiff-Appellant's pedigree set

out in the plaint the land was originally 10 Acres extent. After the

survey the specific above mentioned land was found to be in extent of 9

Acres 3 Roods 32 Perches consisting of lots 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The Plaintiff-Appellant pleaded that the corpus of the action consists of

Lots 1 to 4 meanwhile 2nd , 3rd and 5th Defendants-Respondents argued

that Lot 4 Cannot be a part of the land sought to be partitioned and

thus it be should be excluded.

Later after the trail before the Learned District Judge of Matale the

subject matter was resolved and that Plaintiff-Appellant also admitted

himself only to the lots 1, 2 and 3 and then the partition action was

proceeded accordingly in the District Court. (Page at 163)

It is clear that lot 4 was excluded from the corpus and the corpus IS

restricted to lot 1, 2 and 3 in the Preliminary Plan and now the land

available to be partitioned is only 8 Acres 3 Roods and 36 perches.

It is also to be noticed that one Pragnadasa who acquired undivided

shares from the original owners had transferred to the Plaintiff-

Appellant, 1st, 2nd and 3 rd Defendants-Respondents i~ equal shares.

I am of the view that the Learned District Judge of Matale in his

judgment has calculated the shares of the Plaintiff-Appellant, 1 st, 2nd

and 3rd Defendants-Respondents according to the reduced extend

which is 8 Acres 3 Roods and 36 Perches, but when calculating the

shares of the 4th Defendant-Respondent he has not considered the

reduced extent and misdirected himself considering according to the

proportions in 4th Defendant-Respondent's respective deeds and came

in conclusion that the 4 th Defendant-Respondent entitled for 2 Acres 2

Roods 20 Perches.

In Mather vs. Tamotheram Pillai 6 NLR 246, Layard C.J. clearly

pointed out the duty of a trail judge that he should ascertain the

portion (land) and the correct parties.

' ... the paramount duty is cast by the Ordinance upon the Judge himself

in partition proceedings to ascertain who the actual owners of the land

ought to be partitioned ... '

( ... no loophole should be allowed to a Judge by which he can avoid

performing the duty cast expressly upon him by the ordinance.' (Page at

250)

Therefore, I am of the firm view; the allocation of the shares to all the

parties should have been on the basis of 8 Acres 3 Roods and 36

Perches.

For these foregoing reasons, I allow the appeal and set aside the

judgment of the Learned District Judge of Matale.

Page' 5 of 6

I further hold that calculation on the basis of 8 Acres 3 Roods and 36

Perches as follows:

Plaintiff-Appellant undivided

1st Defendant-Respondent undivided

2nd Defendant-Respondent undivided

3rd Defendant-Respondent undivided

4th Defendant-Respondent undivided

Appeal Allowed.
