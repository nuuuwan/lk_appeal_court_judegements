ACHALA WENGAPPULI I.

The Accused-Appellant who was the acting Registrar of the

Magistrate's Court of Maligakanda at the relevant time. was indicted before

the High Court of Colombo for committing Criminal BrE'ach of Trust, an .

offence punishable under Section 392 of the Penal Code read with Section

5(1) of the Offences against the Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982! in

respect of a sum of Rs.206,320.00

After trial, he was convicted as charged and was imposed a five-year

term of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 618,960.00 coupled with a d.efauIt '

sentence of two years of imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Accused .

Appellant preferred the instant appeal: seeking-intervention of this Court ~

to set aside the said conviction and sentence.

At the hearing of his appeal, Learned Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant, raised only one ground of appeal by presenting a contention '

2

I -

that the evidence led by the prosecution revealed an 1/ illegal" entrustment

of the amount of money in respect of which the offence of CBTis said to

have been committed. Since there is no legally- acceptable entrustment,

learned Counsel contended that the Accused-Appellant is entitled to be .

acquitted of the offence he was found guilty ...

The case presented by the prosecution is that the Accused-Appellant

was handed over Rs. 206,320.00 whilst he was serving as the acting

Registrar of Maligakanda Magistrate's Court. These amounts of monies are

production items of case Nos. 3854jC and 125224 that were pending

before the said Court. The prosecution relied on the evidence of witnesses

including the production officer, the Magistrate who served during the

time period, and the auditor who conducted the audit investigation to

establish the charge levelled against the Accused-Appellant.

, .

According to the Counsel, the evidence revealed that the Accused-

Appellant was 1/ entrusted" with the amount specified in the indictment by

a clerk who was attached to the Registry of the relevant Magistrate's Court

as its production officer. The said amount of money was handed over to

the custody of the Accused-Appellant by the said production officer

without following proper procedures and had no authority to do so.

Learned Counsel submitted that therefore the evidence presented by the

prosecution before the trial Court raises the important issue whether the.

production officer had the authority to handover monies to the Accused-

Appellant legally. He further raised the question that if the anSwer to that

issue is in the negative then could there be .Criminal Breach of Trust of

property illegally obtained as a subject matter of Robbery?

3 .

.. l

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his reply submitted that there

was clear evidence presented by the prosecution in relation to the element

of entrustment and the conduct of the Accused-Appellant during the audit

investigation clearly established his complicity in committiI!g. CBT on

items of productions which are related to criminal prosecutions that are

pending before the relevant Magistrate's Court. He invited the attention of

this Court to the relevant segment in the judgment of the trial Court,

where it has been held that there was no necessity for a Magistrate to make

a specific order in relation to the items of productions for its safekeeping

and the Accused- Appellant failed to specify any regulation that had

imposed such a requirement.

In the light of the above matters, we now proceed to consider the

solitary ground of appeal that had been relied upon by the Accused-

Appellant in support of his appeal.

The said ground of the Accused-Appellant is apparently based on

the folloY"ing items of evidence presented before the trial Court;

a. the Accused-Appellant was the acting I-<.egistrar of the

Magistrate's Court of Maligaknnda during the relevant

period as specified in the indictment,

b. the production officer ( PW4 Abeysinghe Bandara) has

handed over cash amounting to Rs. 59,320.00 along with

several other items of productions in respect of case No.

125224 in the said Court to the Accused-Appellant on

15.07.1997,

c. PW4 also handed over cash amounting to Rs. 1,48,480.00 in

respect of case No. 3854 in the said Court to the Accused-

4

Appellant with an entry in the case record, which reads to

the effect that as per the order of the Magistrate, Rs.

1,48,480.00 was handed over to the Accused-Appellant to

be retained in the safe on 9.09.1996,

d. there are entries made in the production register as well as

in the relevant case records confirming the act of handing

over cash in respect of these two cases by PW4 and its

acceptance by the Accused -Appellant,

e. there are no requests made by the production officer or the

Accused-Appellant to the Magistratt::, informing him of the

difficulty in retaining cash and, to grant authorisation for

the cash to be deposited in the bank account,

f. there are no orders by the Magistrate directing the

Registrar to deposit the cash that had heen accepted by the

prod uction officer in the bank account,

g. PW4 claims that he had obtained verbal instructions from

PW3 A.M.M. Saheeb, who was serving as the Magistrate of

the said Court to hand over cash to the Accused-Appellant

in the steel safe und.er his custody,

h. PW3 contradicts PW4 on this point by stating in evidence

he never gave any verbal instructions to the witness

directing him to handover cash to the Accused-Appellant,

i. PW7 Gunasekara who conducted audit investigation in

respect of this detection stated in evidence that he had

perused the relevant case records and found that even

though the cases were called before the Magistrate on

I

5

several days no order was made directing the cash to be

deposited in the bank by the Magistrate,

j. PW7 also said in evidence that the cash should have been

with the production officer (PW4) who claimed th?t he

handed over cash to the Accused-Appellant for safe

keeping as he had no such facility.

Thus, the Accused-Appellant claims that the element of

"entrustment" in the offence of CBT has not been made out by the

prosecution owing to the "illegality" of the process of handing over cash

by PW4, the production officer, to him.

Section 392 of the Penal Code states that;

"Whoever, being in any mr.:1r.e'" <;ntrlstecf with property, or with

any dominion over property, in his capacity of a public serva,"lt or

in the way of his business, as a banker, merchant, factor, broker,

attorney, or agent, commits criminal breach of trust in respect of

that property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to tPn years, and shall

also be liable to fine."

There is no challenge to the fact that the Accused-Appellant was

indicted for committing CBT as a "public servant" as per section 392 of the

Penal Code. The only element that had been contested by the Accused-

Appellant is the element of entrustment.

6

I I

In M.E.A. Cooray v The Queen 54 N.L.R. 409 the Privy Council

considered the scope of the offences of CBT in its order of aggravation

upon the sentence prescribed in each of the situations mentioned in the

different sections starting from section 388 to section 392(B) Qf the Penal

Code.

Their lordships observed that;

"It will be observed that the widest and most general provision is

that contained in section 388 inasmuch as it applies to all

members of the public.

On the other hand sections 390 to 392 (A) apply to limited

classes, treat their behaviour as more heinous and impose a

heavier penalty. The final section 392 (B) which like 392 (A) is a

later addition, creates a different crime and treats it as subject to

the same penalties as those prescribed byseciion 389.

In our view this judgment deals with somewhat similar factual

situation that had arisen for consideration by this Court in the instant

appeal. It is evident from the text that the appellant before their Lordships

was the President of a Co-operative Union which supplied goods to retail

stores of the Union through wholesale depots. He was also the President of

the Committee which controlled the depot at Moratuwa in addition to be

the Vice President of the Colombo Co-operative Central Bank.

Their Lordships, considered the method by which-the business was

. carried on by these establishments. In orderto identify the similarity with

the instant appeal, the process of /I entrustment" had to be reproduced

below in detail.

7

I I 1 j t

It was observed by the Privy Council that;

1/ the Colombo Co-operative Central Bank advanced monies to

member business societies to enable them to buy their stocks.

These advances were repaid weekly and except in the case of small

sums should have been so paid by money orders and cheques and

not in the shape of cash. The Central Bank in its turn paid in the

money orders, cheques and any cash which might have been

received in that firm to its account with the bank of Ceylon.

... it appears that the appellant secured the appointment of a

certain Ranatunga to be manager of the A-10ratuwa depot.

Through him as manager payments of sums due from t~lat depot

had to be made to and deposited promptly with the Cv-operative

Central Bank.

The appellant appears to have insfnl('fed R!!n(1t!Jr!g!l~ instead of

following out the prescribed routine, to collect large sums from

the retail stores in cash and hand them over to him to be

transmitted to the bank. Ranatunga acted upon those instructions

and transferred the cash which he had collected to the appellant,

who instead of paying it over appropriated the cash and

substituted for it his own cheques for the amount due.

All cheques received by the Co-operative Central Bank should

have been immediately sent to the Bank of Ceylon for collection.

The appellant however as vice president of the Central Bank

ensured that in many instances his cheques were not sent fonuard

for collection, with the result that when ultimately his activities

were discovered some thirty-five cheques had not been presented.

These cheqlles were some of those which the appellant had

substitllted for the cash which he had receiz 1ed from Ranatllnga

8

IIl II II

and it was for misappropriation of Rs. 57,500 being part of this

cash that the appellant was ultimately convicted for criminal

breach of trust as an agent."

The question of law that had been presented before. the Privy

Council by the appellant in support of his appeal was whether he was

entrusted with property in the way of his business as an /I agent" and

converted it into his own use and consequently comes directly within the

words of the statute.

Having considered the said question of law, their Lordships have

allowed the appeal of the appellant on the footing that the appellant had

not acted as an /I agent" and thereby the prosecution has failed to prove the

aggravated form of the offence he was charged with.

__ -_ '-",- \\T.h!3L1s relevant to the instant appeal in thatjlJdgP1~J1t js.Jhat their

Lordships, having found that the appellant in the said appeal is 1/ intLO

sense entitled to receive the money entrusted to him in any capacity nor indeed

had Mr. Ranatunga authority to make him agent to hand it over to the bank",

nonetheless conclu~ed that /I the appellant has however plainly been gu~lty of a

criminal breach of trust under section 389 of the Penal Code /I and therefore

recommended to /I discharge the conviction under section 392 and substitute for

it a conviction under section 389./1

This is a clear instance where the Court has accepted that the

applicability of the term /I entrustment" ,in relation to the offence of

Criminal Breach of Trust, should not be restricted only to the instances

where the offender was "legally" entitled to receive any property as the'

Accused- Appellant contends. Section 392 of the Penal Code does not

recognise such a qualification since the applicable phrase of the said

9

I

section is "whoever, being in any manner entrusted with

property ... "(emphasis added). The said phrase does not imply a restricted

scope of the manner in which the entrustment could take place. Since the

use of the words "in any mam1er" clearly connotes an all-encompassing

notion of entrustment without attaching any adjectives such as immoral,

irregular or illegal to it, we are not inclined to accept the Accused-

Appellant's contention on this point.

As referred to by the learned Deputy Solicitor General in his

submissions, the trial Court had already concluded that there is no

"illegality" of handing over the production items in the form of cash to the

Accused-Appellant by the production officer without prior approval of the

Magistrate.

. "IH:.s1m the-pb.-rpose of clarity, this finding c.f the~tr~~:-.2'.u.r~neceled

to be considered in reference to relevant factors. The terms "illegality" or

/I contrary to law" used in the judgment of the trial Court originated from

the position taken up by the Accused-Appellant before it. The trial Court

had used these terms Dlerely to reject the claim of the Accused-Appellant

that the entrustment is not legal. Therefore, the trial Court had correctly

refrained from examining the "legality" of the entrustment and merely

made references to them in a rather loose sense and not in relation to

actual violation of any statutory provision.

The evidence before the trial Court, as elicited by the Accused-

Appellant during cross examination of the prosecution witnesses, is that

PW4 had acted in violation of the procedures that govern handling of cash

and not in violation of any statutorily laid down provision of law. Even if

the Accused-Appellant's submission is accepted at most his claim could

10

III

I

only be termed as an instance of "irregular" entrustment and not an

"illegal" entrustment.

It is evident that the applicable procedure governing instances

where the productions included cash are found in the' Financial

Regulations.

Chapter X of the Financial Regulations deals with "Accounts of

Courts", FR 580(1) lays down the instances where Court officers are

authorised to accept moneys and FR 580(1)(f) refers to "productions in

criminal cases". The indictment refers to two instances where the cash that

had been accepted by the Court are in fact "productions in criminal cases".

FR 316(1)(e) and FR 587(2) imposes duty on the Court officers to deposit

"cash" which are itenlS of productions in "iron safes", Note 1 to FR 316(1)

furthe.r ,_ emr1J;as~f.'~. t.bis.. requirement by stating ."~.JJ-.~bl~ :.J=9..u.rt

productions" such as cash "should always be kept in the Court safe," The

presiding Judges of Courts, who are considered as Accounting Officers,

are required under FR. 128(1)(e) to ensure adequate and proper

arrangements for the safe custody and preservation of money.

P\Af4 in his evidence had explained as to what compelled him to

hand over the cash received as productions to the Accused-Appellant. He

had stated in evidence that during the relevant time the Court house was

shifted to a location in Colombo 7 and he had to shuttle back to

Maligakanda where the Registry continued to function. He had cash kept in

separate but sealed envelopes. The production room of the Court in

Colombo 7 premises was a small temporary unit, partitioned with wooden

planks and valuable items were kept in a steel cupboard. Due to exposure

to rain water the partition had rotted away posing a threat of security

11

breach. This segment of evidence remains unchallenged by the Accused-

Appellant.

The witness also claims that this insecure environment to valuable

productions compelled him to hand them over to the Accused-Appellant

with the concurrence of the presiding Judge. Of course, the Magistrate in

his evidence, had denied that he was ever consulted, or he gave his

approval for such a change of custody. However, the fact remained that

the cash was handed over to the Accused-Appellant with entries made in

the productions register and in the relevant case records with written

acknowledgement by the Accused-Appellant. In these circumstances, the

mere absence of the Magistrate's concurrence does not render the act: of

transfer of custody by PW4 to the Accused-Appellant as an instance of

irregular transfer of custody of cash, when viewed in the light of the

applicable Financial Regulations. As the trial Court notes there cannot be

any artificial boundaries that exist, in discharging of the responsibility of

ensuring the safe keeping of valuable items of productions, between the

Court officers who are entrusted with its custody.

Lastly the factual position in relation to the alleged acknowledgment

by the Accused-Appellant should be considered.

Learned Counsel highlighted that the Accused-Appellant had

denied the signatures that are claimed by the prosecution as proof of

entrustment in his evidence and the manner in which these signatures

appear on paper raises issues in relation to its authenticity.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to counter this challenge

on the basis that the said question of fact that had already been decided in

12

i j I i

I 1

favour of the prosecution by the trial Court. He further submitted that

those signatures are in fact of the Accused-Appellant's, by referring to his

subsequent conduct to the detection of the fraud.

All the prosecution witnesses, whose evidence had alieady been

referred to, are consistent in their evidence in relation to the conduct of the

Accused-Appellant. It is revealed that the Accused-Appellant, although

reported to work on the day the auditors were to examine the contents of

the steel safe, deliberately avoided them by remaining in the canteen area

disregarding the direction by the Magistrate to be present. The Accused-

Appellant thereafter did not report to work and requested that he be

placed under medical leave. He was thereupon notified at his residential

address through the Police to be present for an audit investigation. But he

opted nottQ,_ Th~ steel s)~te to vlhich only the Accused-Ap-Dell~nt pa(t~ .

key, had to be opened without his participation by employing a lock smith

for that purpose by the auditors. Until then it had been sealed off by the

auditors and when it was opened in the presence of the Magistrate and

PW4, they found empty enveloiJs which had the markings of the case

numbers that are specified in the indictment on them. The fact of finding

these empty envelops with case numbers written on them in the safe to

which only the Accused-Appellant had a key, amply support the claim of

the PW4 that he had handed them over to the Accused-Appellant for safe

keeping.

Therefore, the denial of the authorship of the acknowledgement of

cash from PW4 was raised by the Accused-Appellant for the first time in

Court was rightly rejected by the trial Court. The witnesses called by the

prosecution are familiar with the handwriting of the Accused-Appellant

13

II ,I

II

and had no difficulty in identifying his signature. Witness Gunasekara who

is not familiar with the handwriting of the Accused-Appellant had taken

extra care to compare them with his other signatures that appear in the

attendance register and was satisfied that it was similar.

During the cross examination of the Accused-Appellant, he had

admitted that he did not participate in the audit inquiry. He also admitted

that he did not make any statement affirming his position taken up before

the trial Court. -The trial Court, having considered the evidence presented

on behalf of the Accused-Appellant, correctly finds that it did not result in

raising a reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case.

We have carefully considered the submissions of the Counsel and

are of the considered view that for the reasons stated in the preceding

paragraphs, tlle"'tqJpe-ai of ih-eAccused-Appellant is without dn5nheritartd ~L" --.:

therefore ought to be dismissed.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence of the Accused-Appellant

is affirmed and his appeal is thereby dismissed.
