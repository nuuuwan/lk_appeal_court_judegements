The Petitioner-Appellant has filed an appeal in this court seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge ,:>f Provincial High Court of Wayamba

province holden in Puttalam dated 01.0,' .2008 in Case No. HCR 04/2007 and

seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of

Anamaduwa dated 02.08.2007 in Case No; 451741 A.

Facts of the Case:

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter refeI ~ed to as the' Appellant') was the owner

,~f a tractor bearing No. 36 Shri 2507 and ,t trailer attached to it. His son named V.

Nuwan Kumara (Accused-driver) was ch'irged before the Learned Magistrate of

Anamaduwa for illegally transporting 'K uratiya' sticks on or about 26.02.2007

valued at Rs.15201=, an offence punishabl,! under section 40 read with sections 24

and 250f the Forest Ordinance (as amended). On 15.03.2007, the Accused-Driver

had pleaded guilty to the said offence and the Learned Magistrate of Anamaduwa

had imposed a fine of RS.50001=. Thereafter a vehicle inquiry claim was

conducted with regard to the confiscation of the Tractor bearing No. 36 Shri 2507

along with the trailer, which was allegedly used for the said offence. After

concluding the inquiry, the Learned Magi~trate of Anamaduwa had ordered to

confiscate the vehicle by order dated 02.08.2007. Being aggrieved by the said

Page 3 \If 11

order, the Appellant has filed a revision al'plication in the Provincial High Court of

Wayamba province holden in Puttalam under case No. HCR 04/2007. The Learned

High Court Judge of Puttalam has dism,issed the said revision application by the

order dated 01.07.2008.

Being aggrieved by said dismissal, the Appellant has preferred an appeal to this

court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant has averred following grounds of appeal;

i) The order of the Learned Magistnte dated 02.08.2007 was contrary to law

and the Learned High Court Judge tJTed in law for the failure to consider the

same,

ii) The order of the Learned Magistrate was contrary to the weight of

evidence adduced at the vehicle inquiry, ..

iii) The Learned Magistrate had failed to consider from the circumstances of

the case that the vehicle being used for the committing of offence was

beyond the control of the Appellant

iv) The order of the Learned Magistrate was contrary to principles of natural

justice, particularly audi alteram partem rule,

v) The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by taking the preVIOUS

conduct of the offender into consideration and caused grave prejudice to the

Appellant by considering the Appellant's failure to disclose his relationship

with the offender,

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that the evidence led at the

vehicle inquiry had disclosed that the Appellant had no knowledge of the

Page 4 of 11

commISSIOn of the offence. The Learn ~d Counsel has submitted the case of

Manawadu V. The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30, in which it was held that,

"By Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1981? it was not intended to deprive an owner

, of his vehicle used by the offender; in committing a 'forest offence' without

his (owner's) knowledge and without his participation. The word 'forfeited'

must be given the meaning 'liable t:) be forfeited' so as to avoid the injustice

that would flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the accused. The amended sub-section 40 does not

exclude by necessary implication 'he rule of 'audi alteram partem' . The

owner of the lorry not a party to' the case is entitled to be heard on the

question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfies the court that the accused

committed the offence without his lt710wledge or participation, his lorry will

not be liable to forfeiture.

The Magistrate must hear the owner of the lorry on the question of showing

cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied

with the cause shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. The Magistrate

may consider the question of releasing the lorry to the owner pending

inquiry, on his entering into a bond with sufficient security to abide by the

order that may ultimately be bindin_5 on him"

The Appellant in his evidence had stated, that the Accused-driver was his son and

! he had given the vehicle to the son to tra1sport sand and gravel. However, during

the cross-examination the Appellant had stated that he clearly instructed the son,

II. not to transport any sand and gravel or not to take vehicle away from home at all

(Page 55 and 56 of the brief). This position had been identified by the Learned

Magistrate as a contradiction.

In the aforesaid case ofManawadu, ShaH vananda, C.J further stated that,

" ... Dixon C.J., in Commissioner of Police v. Tanes(1957-58) 68 CLR 383,

underl i ~d this canon of interpretation:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can be punished ! or prejudiced in his person or his property by any judicial or quasi-judicial

procedure, he must be afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

It is pertinent to note that the instant case ~as decided prior to the Amendment Act

No.65 of 2009 which amended Section 4C of the Forest Ordinance. We find that

the Learned Magistrate of Anamaduwa had correctly followed the aforesaid

decision of Manawadu Case and had givfn ample opportunity to the Appellant to

show cause against an order of confiscatio~1. Therefore we reject the contention of

f the Appellant that the Learned Magistrate had acted contrary to the principles of

natural justice.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Learned Magistrate had

failed to consider that the Appellant was not at all involved in the offence and the , tractor being used for the offence was beyol1d his control.

In the case of Orient Financial Service~ Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appe:al No. 120/2011], it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore it is 'settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. ,

I If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commis.sion of the offence or the offence was

Page 6 of 11

..

committed without his knowledge n(1r he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P,H. De Silva rCA (PH C) 86/97), it was

,1 held that. I ,

"For these reasons I hold that givt'1g mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the

instructions ... "

It is our considered view that the Appellailt is bound to show cause that he had no

knowledge of the offence being committed and he had taken every possible step to

prevent an offence being committed. TLerefore merely stating that he had no

control over the vehicle or had no control! over an offence being committed would

~ not in fact be sufficient enough to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner . . ' "

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant ',.mbmitted that the Learned High Court

Judge of Puttalam had considered the previous conduct of the offender. The

Learned Counsel further submitted that be Learned High Court Judge caused a

grave prejUdice to the Appellant by focusing on the failure of the Appellant to

disclose, in the petition submitted to the High Court, the relationship of father and

son between himself and the accused.

In the case of Dabanayake and otbers V. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation

Ltd. and otbers (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 67, it \\:as held that,

"If there is no full and truthful disclosure of material facts, the Court would

not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination ... "

Page 7 ,of 11

In the case of Lokugalappaththige Cyril & Others V. Attorney General [S.C

(Spl.) L.A. No. 272/2013] it was held that,

"In a brief manner a fair and fun disclosure of all material facts would be

essential and should be pleader;J in applications to Superior Courts by

), parties aggrieved of orders and judgments of the lower courts. In the same

~

" manner a ''plain and concise statements of all facts and material" would be

mandatory for special leave to Appeal Applications to the Supreme Court ... "

However, we observe that the Learned I-ligh Court Judge has stated as follows;

" ... D6~zm~ 8c..:)Ja~oe3 q@z53zm~ ~2:rl'2AldDJ ~w 6zm d'dJ25)0'd' a~oeJD 80. e:3

of the brief)

We are unable to find any reference m{de with regard to the previous conduct of , the offender in the confiscation order. Upon perusal of the order it is understood

that the Learned Magistrate had referred to the fact that the same tractor was

involved in an offence earlier as well.

The Appellant had answered during the cross-examination of vehicle inquiry as

follows;

c: ~zsi'25)DJ" (Page 59 of the brief)

Page 8 of 11

This Court held in a recently decided case of R.W. Chaminda Parakrama V.

Attorney General and another rCA (PHC) APN 54/2016], that,

"It is pertinent to note that the vf!hicle was previously involved in another

offence as well. Therefore the degree of preventive measures that should

have been taken by the owner of the vehicle to prevent an offence being

committed again using the veaicle is comparatively higher. But the

Petitioner had re employed the Accused driver after giving mere verbal

instructions which in fact is if/sufficient to establish, on a balance of

probability, that he has taken every possible precaution to prevent an

offence being committed. "

Accordingly we find that the above reaspning of the Learned Magistrate as well as

the Learned High Court Judge was corr~ct in law and had not caused prejudice to

the Appellant as contended by the Learned Counsel.

In the case of Rust om V. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 SLLR 225, it was stated that,

"The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers

of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available only if the

existence of special circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of

this court to exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then this court will not exercise its powers in . . " reVISIOn ...

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exerCise them whether an appeal lies or not or

Page ~ of 11

whether an appeal had been ta,bn or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the court ... "

Accordingly we are of the view that the Appellant had failed to demonstrate the

exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of Provincial High Court and

therefore the Learned High Court Judge was correct in dismissing the said revision

application.

We see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of

Puttalam and the Learned Magistrate of Anamaduwa.

The Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
