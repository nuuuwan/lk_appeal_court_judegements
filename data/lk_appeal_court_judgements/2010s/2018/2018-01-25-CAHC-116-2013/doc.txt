Accused - Appellant is present produced by the Prison Authorities. The

counsel makes submissions and points out certain defects in the

proceedings, any how he had instructions from his client to withdraw the

appeal and to make an application to re consider the sentence imposed on

him. The accused -appellant who is present before the court informs that

he wants to withdraw the appeal. Counsel makes submissions in

mitigations and he submits this had happened in 2001 and the sentence

was passed in 2013. Now the accused-appellant is 68 years old in latter

part of his life serving in the prison. Therefore, the counsel moves court

to reconsider the sentence and to give a maximum possible concession to

the accused-appellant. He is not only regretting and also repending for the

offence that he has committed. Further he is not contesting the case and

he is only seeking redress from the court. Senior Deputy Solicitor General,

Mr. Chethiya Gunasekera maintaining the highest tradition of the Attorney

General's Department and submits that he IS supporting

the conviction but as far as the sentence is concerned he is leaving to the

discretion of the court, any how he has no objections for the reasonable

reduction of the sentence. Considering all submissions and the facts of

the case we find that the conviction is warranted by the available evidence.

Therefore, we are affirming the conviction.

Regarding the sentence we consider 20 years is excessive. The sentence

imposed on the 2nd and 3rd counts 20 years rigorous imprisonment is

replace with 10 years rigorous imprisonment other than this alteration, all

the other conditions will remain as it is. For clearance, the sentence is re

produced as follows;

For the 1st count seven years ngorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

2,500/ - in default 6th months simple imprisonment.

For the 2nd count 10 years ngorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

10,000/- in addition Rs. 50,000/- victim to be paid to the Kapugikiyanage

Lakshika Sanjeewani in default 1 year rigorous imprisonment.

For the 3rd count 10 years rigorous imprisonment in addition to that Rs.

20,000/ - fine in default 6 months simple imprisonment. Additionally, Rs.

700,000/- compensation to be paid to said victim Sanjeewani in default

2 years rigorous imprisonment. The sentences imposed on the 1st, 2nd and

3rd namely 7 years, 10 years & 10 years will run concurrently. If the fine

I !

and the compensations are not paid the default sentences will be

implemented consecutively. Regarding the main sentence the accused

appellant was in remand from the date of conviction. Therefore, we direct

the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from the date of

conviction namely, 04.04.2013. The Appeal against the conviction IS

affirmed and the appeal against the sentence is allowed.
