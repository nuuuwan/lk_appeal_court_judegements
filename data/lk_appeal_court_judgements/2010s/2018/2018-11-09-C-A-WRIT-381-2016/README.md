The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the cancellation of the nomination of the

Petitioner as successor to a permit issued to A.M. Methiyas Appuhamyl;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to grant

the Petitioner the right to succeed to the said permit issued to A.M.

Methiyas Appuhamy.

The facts of this case briefly are as follows.

1 A copy of the said permit has been annexed to the petition, marked 'Pl'.

2

The Petitioner and the 4th and 5th Respondents are the children of Abeyweera

Manage Methiyas Appuhamy and Samarasinghe Kankanamge Nonahamy. The

Petitioner states that Methiyas Appuhamy had been issued a permit by the 1st

Respondent Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka in respect of a land in extent of

1.067 hectares, under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. A

copy of the said permit dated 8th September 1990 has been annexed to the

petition, marked 'Pi'.

The Petitioner states that in terms of Section 51 of the Land Development

Ordinance, Methiyas Appuhamy had nominated the Petitioner as the successor

under the said permit 'Pi'. The s.::Jid nomination had been duly registered on

20th September 1994, as borne out by the land ledger produced by the 1st

Respondent marked 'lR3'.

By letter dated 27th June 1997, produced by the 1st Respondent marked 'lR2',

Methiyas Appuhamy had informed the Divisional Manager of the 1st

Respondent that the original permit issued to him had been misplaced and had

requested that a new permit be issued to him and to cancel the said misplaced

permit. Accordingly, the office copy of the original permit had been certified

and issued to Methiyas Appuhamy. The 1st Respondent has submitted with his

Statement of Objections a copy of the certified copy of the permit, marked

'lRi' .

Methiyas Appuhamy had made an application at about the same time to

cancel the nomination of the Petitioner as the successor to the permit 'Pi'.

This Court observes that in terms of Section 53 of the Land Development

Ordinance, any nomination of a successor may at any time be cancelled by the

permit-holder who made such nomination. It appears from 'lRl' that the

3

cancellation of the nomination of the Petitioner had been duly effected. Thus,

the cancellation by Methiyas Appuhamy of the nomination of the Petitioner is

within the law.

It appears from the complaints made to the Hambantota Police Station by

Nonahamy, produced by the 4th Respondent marked '4RSi' - '4RSiii' that the

Petitioner had ill treated his parents at about this time and that this may have

prompted Methiyas Appuhamy to cancel the nomination made in favour of the

Petitioner. It also appears that the original of the permit 'P1' was in possession

of the Petitioner and that his refusal to hand over 'P1' to Methiyas Appuhamy

had prompted Methiyas Appuhamy to make a complaint that the permit had

been misplaced. Having cancelled the nomination in favour of the Petitioner,

Methiyas Appuhamy had nominated Nonahamy, his spouse as the successor.

This nomination of Nonahamy as successor had been duly registered on 28th

June 1997 and is reflected on the reverse of '1R1', as well as on the land ledger

relating to this land, marked '1R3'.

By a letter dated 9th October 1997 produced by the 1st Respondent marked

'1R4', Methiyas Appuhamy had nominated his daughter, 5th Respondent

Abeyweera Manage Padmawathie as his successor. This nomination too had

been duly registered on the reverse of the permit marked '1R1', as well as on

the land ledger relating to this land, marked '1R3'.

Methiyas Appuhamy had passed away on 4th February 1998. On 10th June

1999, a grant had been issued to Nonahamy under Section 19(4) of the Land

Development Ordinance, in respect of the land that was the subject matter of

the permit. A copy of the said grant has been produced by the 4th Respondent,

marked '4R7'.

4

On 6th June 2003, Nonahamy had nominated the 4th Respondent Abeyweera

Manage Dharmasiri as her successor under the grant '4R7'. A certified copy of

the said nomination has been annexed to the grant which has been produced

with the petition, marked 'pg'. After the passing away of Nonahamy on 21st

February 2008, the nomination of the 4th Respondent had been entered in the

'Register of Permits / Grants under the Land Development Ordinance',

annexed to the petition marked 'P7'.

It is in the above factual circumstances that the Petitioner has filed this

application seeking to quash the cancellation of his nomination as successor.

The basis of the Petitioners' case inter alia is that the cancellation of his

nomination as successor is contrary to Section 87 of the Land Development

Ordinance and that as the original of the permit is still with him, the issuing of

a certified copy of the permit and all steps taken thereafter, are invalid.

The Respondents have submitted that the Petitioner is guilty of laches, in that

this application has been filed in 2016 seeking to quash the cancellation of a

nomination effected in June 1997 - that is 19 years later. The Petitioner has

not offered any explanation as to why he delayed until 2016 to file this

application, except to state in paragraph 23 of the petition that, 'he is not

guilty of unreasonable delay or acquiescence or laches'. The Petitioner has

however not explained the basis of the said statement.

This Court observes that there have been two District Court cases between the

Petitioner and the 4th Respondent and others relating to the nomination of a

successor under the permit and the issuing of the grant. However, the filing of

these two actions in the District Court has not been offered as an explanation

5

i f

.~ I

for the delay by the Petitioner nor can the filing of the said District Court

actions be considered as an explanation for the delay in filing this application.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has not

only failed to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court within a reasonable time, but

has also failed to offer a reasonable explanation for the delay.

Our superior Courts have consistently held that a petitioner seeking a

discretionary remedy such as a Writ of Certiorari must do so without delay and

that where a Petitioner is guilty of delay, such delay must be explained to the

satisfaction of the Court. To put it differently, unexplained delay acts as a bar

in obtaining relief in discretionary remedies, such as prerogative Writs.

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis2 Sharvananda, J (as he then was) set out the

rationale for the above proposition, in the following manner:

itA Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be

held to be a writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise

of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well accepted principles.

The Court is bound to issue a writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by

the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled

himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like

submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver...... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury

is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay

defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a Writ

application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay ...... An application for a Writ of Certiorari

should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the order which

the applicant seeks to have quashed."

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another3 Amerasinghe, J

adverting to the question of long delay, commented as follows:

"lf a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the

law both to punish his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus,

subveniunt, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing4 Bandaranayake J,

dealing with a belated application for a Writ of Certiorari held as follows:

lilt is however to be noted that delay could defeat equity. Although there

is no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limits in filing

an application for judicial review and the case law of this country is

indicative of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding a good

and valid reason for allowing late applications, I am of the view there

should be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such

belated applications. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic

characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay

in applying for the remedy".

This Court must observe that since the cancellation of the said nomination,

many events as explained above, including the cancellation of the very permit

that the Petitioner is now seeking to resurrect, the issuing of a grant in lieu of

the said permit and the registration of a successor under the said grant, have

occurred. The Petitioner is not seeking to quash any of the above. Thus,

equitable considerations will certainly not permit this Court to grant a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the said cancellation of the nomination.

This Court therefore upholds the objection raised by the Respondents that the

Petitioner is guilty of inordinate delay and therefore, is not entitled to the

discretionary remedy of Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus. The Application of

the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000 payable

by the Petitioner to the 4th and 5th Respondents at the rate of Rs. 25,000 each.
