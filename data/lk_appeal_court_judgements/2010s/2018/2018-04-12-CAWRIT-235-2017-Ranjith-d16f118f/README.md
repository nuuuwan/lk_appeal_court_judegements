This matter came up today for the learned Counsel for

the petitioner to support for notices.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as learned

President's Counsel for the 7th Respondent were heard in

support of their cases. The petitioner seeks to quash in this

proceeding the decision contained in the document produced

marked P 53 which is dated 08.04.2014. At the outset this

Court observes that this is a decision which had been taken

almost four years ago.

The complaint of the petitioner is that he was not

gIven a fair hearing in the inquiry which led to the said

decision. Perusal of the document P 53 shows that the

petitioner has failed to establish his entitlement to this liquor

license at the said inquiry.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner relies on the

affidavit marked P 54 to establish that he had furnished all

material pertaining to his entitlement at the said inquiry.

However, this Court observes that this is an affidavit which

had been prepared on 12.08.2014. When queried by this Court

from the learned Counsel for the petitioner as to the

background which led to the preparation of this affidavit, the

learned Counsel was unable to explain any back ground

reason as to why such affidavit was prepared in the year 2014.

(This application has been filed in the year 201 7.) Therefore

there is no justification before this Court as to why the

particular Attorney-at-Law who is said to have appeared for

the petitioner was prompted to prepare this affidavit almost

four years ago. This casts a serious doubt to the credibility of

this affidavit.

5 1

On the other hand, the affidavit produced marked P

54 only refers to the fact that the petitioner had tendered

such documents to the inquiry which led to the decision dated

18.04.2014. We observe that there is no such decision made

on that date. Learned Counsel for the petitioner also concedes

that. Thus, the assertion in the said affidavit is not relevant to

the impugned decision in this case.

Learned President's Counsel for the 7th respondent

brings to the notice of this Court that the 7th respondent had

entered into a lease agreement with the petitioner to run this

liquor shop. Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that he

is not aware of the said lease agreement. He informs Court

that he is not aware as to who ran this liquor shop between

the period 2014 - 2017 (That is the period in the lease

agreement) .

We observe that this liquor shop is situated in

Monaragala. We also observe that the petitioner too resides

in Monagarala (according to the address given in the petition).

This Court is not inclined to accept the position of the learned

.. 6

Counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner was not aware as

to who ran the liquor shop during the said period.

For the above reasons this Court refuses to issue notices

on the respondents. The application is dismissed without

costs.
