Samayawardhena, J.

The respondent-petitioner-appellant (appellant) filed this

application under section 62(1) of the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951, as amended (the Act), seeking leave to

appeal against the order of the Board of Quazis dated 13.05.2017

whereby the revision application of the appellant dated 27.04.2017

to quash the maintenance orders made against him by the Quazi

Court of Colombo South dated 31.01.2015 was dismissed even

without notice being issued on the applicant-respondent-respodent

(respondent). By the said maintenance orders, the appellant was

ordered to pay maintenance to the respondent and the three

children.

Counsel for both parties agreed the leave matter and the main

appeal to be taken up together, and made brief oral submissions

on 31.05.2018. Then counsel for both parties were directed to file

comprehensive written submissions on or before 29.06.2018 with a

copy to the Attorney-at-Law of the opposite party, and submissions

in reply if any on or before 20.07.2018, and fixed the matter for the

Judgment. However only counsel for the respondent has filed

written submissions and no written submissions have been filed

on behalf of the appellant.

Counsel for the respondent takes up a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of this application. Section 62(1) of the Act, which

confers jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal in respect of orders

made by the Board of Quazis, reads as follows: "Any party

aggrieved by any order of the Board of Quazis on any appeal under

section 60 may, with leave of the Court of Appeal first had and

obtained, appeal to that Court from such order." Section 60 refers to

appeals to the Board of Quazis from orders of Quazis. Counsel

3

argues that an order dismissing the revision application filed

before the Board of Quazis under section 44 of the Act is not an

order of the Board of Quazis "on any appeal under section 60" and

therefore application for leave to appeal against such order of the

Board of Quazis under section 62(1) of the Act is misconceived in

law. Counsel does not cite any authorities to buttress this

argument as if this argument is presented for the first time before

this Court.

However, I find that this is not the first time that argument has

been taken before the Court of Appeal. To mention two

contradictory Judgments, in Ameera Jabir v. Yasmin Jabir nee

Nazick1 this argument has been accepted, but in Rizniya v.

Naushad2 it has been rejected.

If section 62(1) is inapplicable, it is interesting to note that counsel

for the respondent does not state the applicable section of the Act

under which the aggrieved party can come before the Court of

Appeal against an order of the Board of Quazis made in a revision

application.

There is no dispute that sections 43 and 44 of the Act deal with the

revisionary powers of the Board of Quazis. Section 44(3) thereof

reads as follows: "Every order made by the Board of Quazis under

this section shall have the same effect as an order made on appeal

from an order made by a Quazi." Hence it is clear that an order

made by the Board of Quazis on a revision application shall have

the same effect as an order made on appeal from an order made by

a Quazi, and therefore is circumscribed by section 62(1), which, if I

may repeat, states, "Any party aggrieved by any order of the Board

1 [1991] 1 Sri LR 282 2 [2002] 2 Sri LR 343

4

of Quazis on any appeal under section 60 may, with leave of the

Court of Appeal first had and obtained, appeal to that Court from

such order". Hence I overrule the preliminary objection.

The main ground upon which the revision application has been

dismissed by the Board of Quazis in limine is the long delay in

filing the applicationa delay of two years and three months from

the orders of the Quazi Court. The Board of Quazis states that "no

explanation to this delay has been given by the petitioner."

Admittedly, if the delay can be explained, that shall not be a

ground for dismissal of the application in limine. (Bisomenike vs.

Cyril de Alwis3, Gnanapanditham & another vs. Balanayagam and

another4, Camil v. Podimenike5, UDA v. Wejayaluxmi6)

According to P16a Report from the Quazi of Colombo South in

relation to proceedings of Fasah Divorce filed by the respondent

the respondent wife is admittedly living in adultery, and the three

children have been left by the respondent in Malaysia against the

wishes of the petitioner. The appellant does not at least have

access to the children. It is to those four, wife and three children,

the Quazi has ordered the appellant to pay maintenance.

The petitioner had been unhappy with the way the inquiry into the

maintenance was conducted by the Quazi. The maintenance

orders have been made on 31.01.2015.

Soon after the maintenance orders were made on 31.01.2015,

according to the impugned order of the Board of Quazis, the

petitioner has complained against the Quazi alleging inter alia bias

3 [1982] 1 Sri LR 368 at 379 4 [1998] 1 Sri LR 391 5 [2012] 1 Sri LR 190 6 [2006] 3 Sri LR 62

5

to the Board of Quazis on 05.02.2015 and to the Judicial Service

Commission on 10.02.2015. The Secretary to the Board of Quazis

by letter dated 16.02.2015 has informed the petitioner to make a

formal complaint following the proper procedure, and the Secretary

to the Judicial Service Commission by an undated letter in April

2015 (P6) has appointed Quazi in Colombo North to hear and

determine these maintenance applications. When the Judicial

Service Commission appoints a new Quazi in April 2015 to hear

and determine the maintenance applications, the appellant had

been satisfied that his grievances would be addressed by the new

Quazi.

However the appellant has been arrested by the police and

produced before the Magistrate's Court on 27.03.2017 upon failure

to pay maintenance in terms of the order of the Quazi dated

31.01.2015. It is thereafter, the petitioner has filed the revision

application before the Board of Quazis. It is my considered view

that the delay is explainable and therefore it should not have been

a ground for refusal of the application. The Board of Quazis has

gone wrong on that point.

The Magistrate's Court proceedings have commenced upon receipt

of the Certificates of Enforcement sent by the Quazi Court. It is

the position of counsel for the respondent that the letter of the

Judicial Service Commission in April 2015 appointing another

Quazi was received by the Quazi who made the maintenance

orders on 09.05.2015 and the Certificates of Enforcement were

sent to the Magistrate's Court on 06.05.2015.

When an official letter is received by any Court or any institution,

it is the practice to place the date stamp on the said letter to

signify the date of receipt of that letter. However I find no such

6

date stamp placed on the letter sent by the Judicial Service

Commission in April 2015 to establish that it was received by the

former Quazi on 09.05.2015.

According to the Magistrate's Court proceedings (P14), the 1st

Journal Entry is dated 21.12.2015 and there is no indication

whatsoever that the Magistrate's Court received the Certificates of

Enforcement on or around 06.05.2015.

The sheet of Journal Entries prepared separately by the Quazi does

not seem to me to be a contemporaneous record maintained by the

Quazi Court as it is done in any other Court.

In any event, when the Judicial Service Commission has taken the

matter out of the former Quazi and appointed another Quazi in

April 2015 to hear and determine the matter, the former Quazi

cannot deal with that matter anymore. Therefore, the former

Quazi has no authority to send the Certificates of Enforcement to

the Magistrate's Court in May 2015. The new appointment is

effective not from the date of the receipt of the letter but from the

date of the letter. The Board of Quazis has not considered this

fundamental matter in its order.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the order of the Board of

Quazis dated 13.05.2017 and the order of the former Quazi dated

31.01.2015 and direct the new Quazi appointed by the Judicial

Service Commission by the letter in April 2015 to hold a fresh

inquiry into the maintenance applications filed by the respondent

and make a suitable order according to law. The Certificates of

Enforcement sent to the Magistrate's Court shall be recalled.

Appeal allowed. No costs.
