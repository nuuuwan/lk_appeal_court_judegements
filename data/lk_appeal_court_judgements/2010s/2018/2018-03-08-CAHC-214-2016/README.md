Judgment

S. Thurairaja PC J

The Accused Appellant (Hereinafter sometimes referred as the Appellant) together

with others was originally indicted before the High Court of Kuliyapitya under case

number HCj176j13 for Robbery. The 4th Accused Kandawala Pathirannalahe Upul

Sanjeeva who was indicted for retention of stolen property, pleaded guilty at the

beginning and sentenced accordingly. The 1st Accused Rajapakse Arachchige Thushara

Ranjan Rajapakse was found guilty under section 380 of the Penal Code and sentenced

to 8 years Rigorous Imprisonment. The 2nd and the 3rd accused persons were acquitted

from the charges for want of evidence.

CA /214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 8

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and Sentence the appellant preferred this

appeal to the Court of Appeal and submitted following grounds of appeal;

I. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Prosecution has not

proved the identification of the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

II. The Judge has not considered inadmissible evidence, particularly section 27

evidence at arriving the said decision.

III. The Judge has failed to consider the inter se and per se contradictions of the

prosecution witness.

IV. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence favourable to

the Accused Appellant.

V. The right to a fair trial had been denied to the Accused, when the learned trial

judge directed the state to treat a prosecution witness as a friendly witness,

after the State Counsel cross examined him under section 154 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

At this stage, it will be appropriate to have some knowledge about the case for the

Prosecution.

At the trial before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya the State lead the evidence of ten

witnesses namely, PW 24. Kandawala Pathiranehelage Upul Sanjeewa, PW 01 Hetti

arachchilage Namal Sujeewa, PW 05 Kokma Duwa Liyanage Don Mahinda Sumith, PW

08 Janitha Fernando, PW 03 Raufdeen Mohamed Irshad, PW 13 Chief Inspector Athula

Shyaman Chrishantha Karunapala, PW 02 Deepal kumara Ratnasekara, PW 11 Police

Inspector Koswatte Liyanage Shirai Perera, PW 22 Police Seargent 57525 Edirisinghe,

PW 26 Police Seargent 32626 Kularatne and the Court interpreter When the Defence

was called the Appellant and two other accused persons made Dock Statements and

closed their case.

Prosecution Witness Mohamed Irshad was involved in transport business, Traders from

far places like North and East buy their trade commodities in Colombo in small

quantity, and hands it over to Irshad, he transports all the items in big lorries for a fee.

CA /214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 8

On the 1st March 2010, as usual the lorry bearing registration number LG- 5767 was

sent to north with goods. Namal Sujeewa was the driver of the said lorry. They travelled

through Negombo. Wariyapola and reached Hettipola Police area there a white

coloured Town Ace van came across their vehicle and made them to stop the same.

When they stopped gang of people who were covering their faces came up to the lorry

and said that they are from the Finance Company and they came to seize the lorry. The

driver replied them saying that there is no finance to their lorry, then the assailants

took control of them and the lorry by force, it was noted by witnesses that they were

armed with swords and things like hockey sticks. The Lorry Driver had seen the face of

the Appellant and identified him at the identification parade conducted by the

Magistrate and from the dock at the High Court. Police conducted investigations and

arrested the Appellant and other accused persons. They also recovered most of the

goods and a white van similar to the description given by the witnesses.

The 1 st ground of appeal is that the Identity of the Appellant was not proved beyond

reasonable doubt. The Counsel for the Appellant submits that there are contradictions

among the prosecution witnesses, therefore the identity was not proved.

Counsel submits that the prosecution witness Upul Kumara Ratnasekara had informed

the Court that the assailants were seen covering their face at the time of the incident,

but the other witness said that he saw the face of the assailant of whom he identified

as the Appellant. The Counsel Submits that this is a contradiction between two

witnesses.

Considering the evidence of all prosecution witnesses specially the driver who claims

that he saw the appellant, it reveals that all of them didn't have the same view. One is

on the Driver's side and the other one was seated in the passenger (Cleaners) side.

Cleaner says that he saw the people covered their faces, but the driver who had a long

encounter with the appellant says that he could see the face and he clearly identified

the appellant not only the face on a glance he describes the appellant in the trial and

CA /214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of8

clear identification at the identification parade also. There is no doubt created in the

minds of the trial judge and our mind sitting in appeal.

Section 124 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA) provides for identification

parade. Even though there are no procedural steps spelled out in the relevant law, it

was developed by case laws.

Attorney General vs. Joseph Aloysius and Others 1992 (2) SLR 264, it was held that "an

identification parade is a means by which evidence of identity is obtained. But it is

certainly not the only means by which it could be established that a witness identified

the accused as the person who committed the offence. Identification can take place,

depending on the circumstances, even where in the course of an investigation the

witness points out the person who committed the offence to the Police. That evidence

too would be relevant and admissible subject however to any statutory provision that

may specifically exclude it at the trial."

The Appellant had admitted the identification parade notes under section 420 of the

CCPA, and filed of record.

Considering the evidence of the persons who were present at the time of the incident,

it is clear that the Appellant was clearly identified therefore the findings of the learned

Trial Judge is acceptable.

Considering the 2nd grounds of appeal, the Appellant submits that the Learned Trial

Judge had considered inadmissible evidence, particularly section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance. The Counsel submits that the Prosecution did not properly produced the

27(1) statement. Generally, a confession made to a Police Officer is inadmissible under

the Evidence Ordinance. But Section 27 (1) is an exception to that rule, because if a

fact is recovered (found) the statement becomes a well-found information.

In the present case the accused appellant was accompanied by the Police Investigation

Officers, had given information to recover some productions. Considering the facts in

this case, it is revealed that some goods were recovered with the assistance of the

CA /214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 8

Appellant's conduct. The learned Trial Judge had considered section 8(2) of the

Evidence Ordinance, not section 27 of the said ordinance.

Section 8 is reproduced for easy reference.

Section 8 Motive, or preparation.

(1) Any fact is relevant, which shows or constitutes a motive or preparation for

any fact in issue or relevant fact Previous or subsequent conduct

(2) The conduct of any partYt or of any agent to any partYt to any suit or

proceeding in reference to such suit or proceeding or in reference to any fact

in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any person an offence

against whom is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant if such conduct

influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact, and whether it

was previous or subsequent therein.

Considering the situation of this case in our view the Learned Trial Judge is correct in

considering section 8 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance than section 27. It is also

appropriate to consider the goods recovered and the explanation given by the

Appellant.

Considering the Judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge, we are of the

view that he was well advised on this issue. Therefore, we have no reason to interfere

with his findings. Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails in its own merits.

3rd and 4th grounds of appeal submitted by the Counsel was that the trial Judge had

failed to consider the contradictions per se and inter se which were favourable to the

appellant.

This issue mostly discussed in identification, recovery of productions and some other

issues. Identification of the Appellant was sufficiently discussed above. It was our

considered finding that the learned Trial Judge had addressed these issues and

satisfied himself regarding the identity of the Appellant. It is also observed that the

CA 1214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 8

Learned Judge of the High Court was not satisfied of the identity of the 2nd and 3rd

accused persons at the trial hence he had acquitted them for want of evidence.

Counsel also submits that the evidence in favour of the Appellant was not considered.

Prosecution witness Upul Sanjeewa (who was the 4th Accused in this case) revealed

many facts in connection with this case. One of them was that the Appellant around

11 - 12 in the night came in a Container type full bodied big lorry and instructed them

to unload the goods. That factor was not contradicted in fact, it was corroborated by

the prosecution witnesses. Further goods recovered also tallies with the goods loaded

and the list of the lorry in question.

Similarly, many other facts submitted by the Counsel were considered by this court,

we also observed that the learned trial Judge had considered almost all the factors in

his judgment. Considering the submissions, evidence and the judgment, we find that

there is no necessity for us to interfere with the findings of the Learned Judge of the

High Court. Hence, these two grounds of appeal also fail in its own merits.

Last ground of appeal submitted by the Counsel for the Appellant is that the Appellant

was denied a fair trial. In support the Counsel submits that the procedure adopted

under section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance is unacceptable.

It will be appropriate to refer the relevant section. For easy reference section 154 is re

produced below;

Section 154 - The court may in its discretion permit the person who calls a

witness to put any question to him which might be put in cross-examination by

the adverse party.

The above section is used in the court under certain circumstances. This section is

provided there to provide reasonableness to both prosecution and accused persons.

Moncrieff J in King vs. Thegis 57 NLR 107 at page 113 stated that "it may be that the

evidence of the party or his witness is very adverse to his own contention, and possibly

it may be in favour somebody else, or even of the other party in the suit. But it is not

CA /214/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7of8

therefore excluded as evidence and questions may be put. And the answers of an

adverse character elicited by them are admissible. It is true that in England a party may

not cross examine his own witnesses unless hostile, but section 154 of our Evidence

Ordinance has released him from that restriction"

Most of the grounds of appeal and the argument advanced by the Counsel for the

Appellant were considerably dealt by the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment.

Considering all Facts, Evidence and the submissions of both Counsels we find the

Learned Judge of the High Court is justified in coming to the decision he arrived. We

have no reason to interfere with the same.

Regarding the sentence the Counsel did not challenge it. According to the evidence

this offence of Robbery had occurred at night at the Highway. Further if this type

actions are allowed, it will be detrimental to the Right of free movement of the people

of this country. Considering the sentence imposed, we find that the Learned trial judge

had imposed a reasonable sentence, we have no reason to reconsider the same. We

affirm the Conviction and the Sentence, and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
