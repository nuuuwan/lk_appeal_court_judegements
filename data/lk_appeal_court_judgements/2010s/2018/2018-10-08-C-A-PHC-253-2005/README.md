ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

" Appellant") invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, seeking to set

aside an order dated 18.10.2005 by the Provincial High Court holden in

Rathnapura in H.C.R.A. 69/2005 and an order of ejectment issued by the

Balangoda Magistrate's Court on 15.06.2005 in case No. 95811.

The 1st Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 1/1 st Respondent") made an application, supported by an affidavit, to

Balangoda Magistrate's Court unde~ Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended, seeking an order of ejectment

of the Appellant from the portion of State land described in its schedule.

After affording an opportunity for the Appellant to show cause, an

inquiry was held by the "Magistrate's Court. The Appellant did not

produce any permit or other lawful authority to justify his continued

possession of the said land, instead, relied on a preliminary objection as to

the validity of the affidavit, filed by the 1st Respondent in support of his

application.

The basis of the objection is that the 1st Respondent had not deleted

the inappropriate words whereby it is not clear that whether he had

affirmed to or sworn as to the correctness of the facts stated therein.

After the inquiry, the Magistrate's Court has issued the impugned

ejectment order by rejecting the said preliminary objection and thereafter

the Appellant invoked revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court, challenging its legality. At the conclusion of the hearing, the

3

Provincial High Court affirmed the order of ejection prompting the

Appellant to prefer this appeal against the said order.

In support of his appeal, the Appellant has raised a solitary ground

of appeal on the basis that both Courts have erroneously rejected his

objection as to the validity of the affidavit and have thereby failed to

appreciate the failure of the 1st Respondent to fulfill the statutory

requirements imposed by the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Appellant heavily relied on the reasoning of the judgment of

Kandiah v Abeykoon Sriskantha L.R. Vol. IV, p.96. He also relied on the

judgments of CA(PHC) 175/2008 --C.A.M. of 10.11.2016 and CA (PHC)

102/2011 - C.A.M. of 01.10.2014, to emphasis the point that conditions

stipulated in the said Act should be followed.

In addition, he relied on a series of judgments where the defects in

the affidavit in relation to the affirmation or oath and jurat are considered.

The 1st Respondent, in his reply invited this Court to the judgment

of the Supreme Court in Facy v Sanoon and 5 Others 2006 [B.L.R.J 58, in

support of the decisions of the lower Courts to overrule the preliminary

objection.

Upon examination of the affidavit of the 1st Respondent filed before

the Magistrate's Court it is observed that there is no clear unambiguous

averment in it indicating whether there was an instance of swearing or of

affirming to. This uncertainty as to whether he has sworn or affirmed as to

the truthfulness of its contents is due to the fact that the inappropriate

words as appeared in the affidavit "~c3~ (5)o)6)~G.i02 C)~@G.i.!D ~g6) g~)~

0>0 85/ ~'~QJ(3)OOClOJ O(3}Cl.!lS (3))03oo)) g6oo>o~ qooo>o~ oom @o~

CJ.!lS gO(3}0>6 85." remain undeleted.

However, the Commissioner of Oath, who placed his signature at the end

of the affidavit, states that "gO>J(3}O> ~8.!lS 2004-02-24 ~~ ~@.!lS(3))C)~ )

<g)'GB80 ocs:>O)o> 0>6~ @~".

In consideration of the reasoning of the judgment of Kandiah v

Abeykoon (supra), it is clear that the order of eviction was challenged on

the basis of "legality of the proceedings" before the Magistrate's Court.

This submission had two components in it.

Firstly, the learned Counsel_submitted before their Lordships that

there was no valid application which complies with the requirements of

Form B in the schedule to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Secondly, it was submitted that there is no valid affidavit in support

of the application, in compliance of Form C of the schedule to the said Act,

as the said affidavit is defective since it had not indicated the place of

deposition and " ... according to the body of the affidavit and the jurat, one does

not know whether the deponent took an oath or made an affirmation and for that

reason as well this affidavit was defective."

It is thus clear that the second component had two parts in it. The

first part dealt with the deficiency of the affidavit as to the place it was

affirmed/ sworn to while the second part deals with the ambiguity of

"whether the deponent took an oath or made an affirmation".

It is on this second part of the second component that the Appellant

before us, seeks to challenge the validity of the order of ejectment, claiming

that there was no valid affidavit in support of the statements of facts

5

contained in the application filed by the 1st Respondent since the said

affidavit is defective as to "whether the deponent took an oath or made an

affirmation" is not clearly evident.

In Kandiah v Abeykoon (supra), the Respondent sought to counter

the challenge mounted on the validity of the affidavit by placing reliance

on Section 9 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance.

H/L Goonewardene J, in delivering the judgment of Court, rejected

this argument by holding that Section 9 applies to judicial proceedings and

not to affidavits. Further His Lordship held that;

"One must 1 think be guided in this regard by the form of affidavit

as contained in the schedule to the Act (Form C) and it must

indicate on its face whether it was,. that the deponent took an oath

or made an affirmation, before it could be said that it was capable

of "verifying to the matters set forth in such application 1/

The Appellant's contention solely based on the above quoted

judicial precedent of Kandiah v Abeykoon (supra) which had been decided

on 02.09.1986, in its support.

Learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent, seeking to

counter the submissions of the Appellant, in relation to the instant appeal

placed reliance of the judgment of the apex Court in Facy v Sanoon and 5

Others (supra) decided on 31.03.2006.

6

.-

In that instance, the contention before the Supreme Court was that

the affidavit-was defective due to the fact that;

/I , the Appellant has commenced his purported affidavit by

stating that he is a Muslim and proceeded to take oath and swear

to the truth of certain facts from his personal knowledge and

documents at his disposal and the Justice of Peace or

Commissioner for Oaths has purported to attest the said affidavit

stating in the jurat clause therein that the Appellant affirmed to

the purported affidavit before him, there is no affidavit valid in the

eyes of the law."

In determining the validity of this submission, their Lordships,

. having considered several judicial precedents which dealt with similar

issues, concluded thus;

"There is no doubt that the jurat clause is the most crucial part of

an affidavit, and as G.P.S. de Silva, CJ pointed out in D. Silva v

L.B. Finance (1993) 1 SLR 371 at page 373, if that jurat expressly

set out the place and date on which the affidavit was signed before

a Justice of Peace that affidavit is in fact valid. It is relevant to

note that in this case the Supreme Court was not inclined to

uphold a purely technical objection to the affidavit on the ground

that the jurat clause did not expressly state that the affidavit was

affirmed before the Justice of Peace when that fact could

reasonably be inferred from the statement contained in the jurat

7

that the affidavit was read over and explained to the "within-

named affirmants".

Returning to the affidavit before us, it is noted at the outset that the

facts are slightly different in this particular instance to that of Kandiah v

Abeykoon (supra) to the extent that, in the appeal before us, it is clearly

stated in the jurat clause that the place where the affidavit was affirmed to

whereas in Kandiah v Abeykoon (supra) it is stated that there was no

indication of the place of the II deposition". In relation to the appeal before

us, there is a pronouncement by the apex Court that II if that jurat expressly

set out the place and date on which the affidavit was signed before a Justice of -Peace that affidavit is in fact valid". This is relation to the first part of the

second segment as noted above.

At the time of Kandiah v Abeykoon (supra), their Lordships did not

hav.e the benefit the reasoning of the authoritativ.e judgment of Facy v

Sanoon and 5 Others (supra).

It has already been observed that in the instant appeal the jurat

clause clearly states that the affidavit of the 1st Respondent was "affirmed"

to before a Commissioner for Oath on 24th February 2004 at Balangoda, thus

fulfilling the necessary requirements as per Facy v Sanoon and 5

Others(supra)making it a valid affidavit, since their Lordships have held;

" the Supreme Court was not inclined to uphold a purely

technical objection to the affidavit on the ground that the jurat

clause did not expressly state that the affidavit was affirmed before

the Justice of Peace when that fact could reasonably be inferred

8

.-

from the statement contained in the jurat that the affidavit was

read over and explained to the "within-named affirmants".

This would result in the applicability of the reasoning in Kandiah v

Abeykoon to be adopted subject to the above quoted segment of the

reasoning of the judgment in Facy v Sanoon and 5 Others.

Section 5(2) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act reads as

follows;

"Every such application under subsection (1) shall be supported -by an affidavit in the Form C set out in the Schedule to this Act

verifying to the matters set forth in such application and shall be

accompanied by a copy of the quit notice."

Upon a plain reading of the said sub section it is seen that the

purpose of an affidavit to be tendered along with an application under

Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is for" ...

verifying to the matters set forth in such application ... 1/ In this sense, the

emphasis of strict compliance to Forms B and C of the said Act by a

Competent Authority, as per the judgment of Kandiah v Abeykoon

(supra) is to be understood in the context that they apply to the contents

of the application and the affidavit which had the character of " ...

verifying to the matters set forth in such application ... "and not to the jurat

clause of the affidavit in view of Facy v Sanoon and 5 Others(supra).

The impugned orders of the Magistrate's Court as well as the

Provincial High Court, though pronounced before Facy v Sanoon and 5

Others (supra) was decided, nonetheless adopted a similar reasoning in

9

rejecting the preliminary objections raised by the Appellant on the

validity of the supporting affidavit to the application under Section 5 of

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The judgments of CA (PHC) 102/2011 - C.A.M. of 01.10.2014 relied

upon by the Appellant re-emphasises the mandatory compliance of the

requirements of Form Band C in applications and affidavits. The

judgment of CA (PHC) 175/2008 - C.A.M. of 10.11.2016 is an instance

where the original of the affidavit bears deletion of the inappropriate

words affirmed/ swear, and as such no disqualification is attributable to

the affidavit.

In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs, it

is our considered view that the solitary ground of appeal of the Appellant

fails. Accordingly, we make order that the appeal of the Appellant stands

dismissed.

In consideration of the nature of the ground of appeal, no cost is

ordered.

IANAK DE SIL V At I.

I agree.
