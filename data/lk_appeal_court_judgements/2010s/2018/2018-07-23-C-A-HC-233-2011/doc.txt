Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

possession and trafficking of 523.5 grams of Heroin an offence

punishable under Sec. 54 A (d) and 54 A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. After trial the appellant was conwicted on

both charges and was sentenced to death.

The prosecution has led the evidence of four witnesses, namely

two police officers who participated in the arrest and recovery of heroin

and the evidence of the police officer who took over the productions till

they were handed over to the Governrnent Analyst. An officer from the

Government Analyst's Department also has given evidence on the report

produced by them and also on the acceptance of the productions. By

these witness the prosecution has produced evidence on the arrest of the

appellant, recovery of the heroin and handing thern over to the

Government Analyst and the learned High Court Judge has acce pted the

prosecution evidence.

On behalf of the accused one witness has given evidence and the

first accused has given evidence on oath and was cross exarT\.illed and

2

the second accused has made a dock statement. The second accused

was acquitted on both charges.

The grounds of appeal argued by the learned counsel for the

appellant was that the learned High Court Judge misdirected himself

when he acquitted the second accused for want of evidence and thereby

casting a doubt on the prosecution evidence on which the first accused

was convicted. The second ground of appeal was that the learned High

Court Judge misdirected himself when he failed to analyse the dock

statement made by the appellant and the evidence given regarding the

productions and not attached any weight to the defence evidence. The

defence counsel further stated that the learned High Court Judge' failed

to appreciate the fact that the police had not carried out investigations

into the bank deposits which had a serious connection to the incidence

which caused a miscarriage of justice.

The counsel for the appellant stated that the learned High Court

Judge failed to consider the principles laid down in judicial authorities by

Superior Courts and misdirected himself by not analyzing the evidence in

proper contest in a capital punishment case.

3

The appellant argued that the test of probability can not be passed

~ -. .

in the instant case as the meter reader of the police jeep iriCficated they

have run 100 kilometers whereas it was impossible to have run so much

according to prosecution evidence. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

said it was 10 kilometers and not 100 as stated by the appellant.

The appellant's counsel also argued that the informant was not

present when the appellant was arrested. The respondents stated that

the police officers acted on information received over the telephone.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the learned

High Court Judge had the advantage of observing the demeanor and

deportment of all the defence witness and has gone into great lengths in

assessing each witness and rejected the evidence as unreliable. He has

also analysed the dock statement of the second accused and rejected it

but acquitted the second accused stating that the prosecution evidence

did not establish that heroin was recovered from his possession. The

argument of the respondent was that this alone show how well the

learned High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence in this case. He.

has stated that the learned High Court Judge has found no doubts raised

in the productions marked and the chain of recoveries and productions.

4

He cited the judgments in Alwis vs Piyasena Fernando 19932 SLLR

119 and AG vs Mary Theresa 2011 2 SLR 292.

In Alwis vs Piyasena Fernando, G.P.S. De Silva CJ has said "it

is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who hears

and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed in appeal. "

In AG vs Mary Theresa it has been held that "there is simply no

jurisdiction in an Appel/ate Court to upset trial finding of fact that has

evidentiary support. 11

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge has carefully

analysed the evidence and as stated by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General this is borne out in his judgment.

The respondent's argued that the tests of consistency and

probability has been put into effect by the learned High Court Judge and

has come to conclusion of accepting the evidence of prosecution witness

giving detailed reasons for accepting them. He cited the judgment in AG

vs Devundarage Nihal 2011 1 SLLR 409 where it was held.

5

(1). There is no requirement in law that a particular number of wi~nesses

shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Unlike in a

case where an accomplice or a decoy is concerned~ in any other case

there.is no requirement in law that the evidence of a police officer

who conducted an investigation or raid resulting in the arrest of an

offender need to be corroborated on material particulars.

(2). Howeve~ caution must be exercised by a trial Judge in evaluating

such evidence and arriving at a conclusion against an offender. It

cannot be stated as a rule of thumb that the evidence of a Police

witness in a drug related offence must be corroborated in material

particulars where Police officers are the key witnesses.

I We find that in the instant case the evidence of the prosecution

witness number one who is the main investigating officer has been more

than satisfactory and his evidence was corroborated by the prosecution

witness number two. As stated in Mary Therresa's case there is no

requirement in law that the evidence of a police officer who conducted a

raid resulting in the arrest of an offender need to be corroborated in

material particulars.

The appellant's argument that the police failed to carry out

investigations with regard to the bank deposit ships made to a third party

by the appellant is not an essential element in the charges against the

6

appellant and this does not affect the credibility of the prosecution

witness.

For the afore stated reasons we decide that the learned High Court

Judge's reasoning is sound and warrants no interfearance by this court.

The judgment dated 25/07/2011 is affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
