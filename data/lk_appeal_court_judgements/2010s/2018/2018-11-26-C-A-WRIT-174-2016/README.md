Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner Farmers Organization-Ekamuthu Govi

Sanvidanaya of Anuradhapura filed this application on

31.05.2016 seeking a mandate by way of a writ of mandamus

compelling the 1st Respondent-Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development, the 2nd Respondent-Deputy

Commissioner of Agrarian Development of Anuradhapura, the

3rd Respondent-Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Development of Anuradhapura, the 4th Respondent-Director

General of Irrigation, the 5th Respondent-Provincial Director of

Irrigation of Anuradhapura, the 6th Respondent-Zonal Director

of Irrigation of Anuradhapura, the 7th Respondent-District

Secretary of Anuradhapura, the 8th Respondent-Divisional

Secretary of Nuwaragama Palatha (Central) of Pandulagama to

discharge their public duties under the Agrarian Development

Act, No. 46 of 2000 and the Irrigation Ordinance, No. 32 of

1946, as amended, to prevent the 9th Respondent-Road

Development Authority and the 10th Respondent-Chief Engineer

of Road Development Authority from constructing a 30 foot wide

roadway over Lolugas Wewa (also known as Kuda Abhaya

4

Wewa1 or Katukeliyawa Wewa2) causing destruction to the

Wewa, its bund, bund reservation and adjacent area.

Notwithstanding notices were served on the Respondents in

June and July 2016, they, not only neglected to file objections,

but also, as I now understand, neglected to file at least proxies.

When this case came up before me on 06.06.2018, I directed the

Respondents to file objections on or before 25.07.2018, and

counter objections on or before 30.08.2018, and fixed the matter

for argument finally for 01.10.2018. The Respondents did not

comply with this direction either.

At the argument, a State Counsel appeared for the Respondents,

without filing objections and, as I now understand, without filing

a proxy. After the argument, the 9th and 10th Respondents-Road

Development Authority and its Chief Engineer have filed a proxy

through their Legal Officer. No proxy has so far been tendered

on behalf of other Respondent Public Officers against whom

mandamus is sought.

Lolugas Wewa is an ancient agricultural water tank in

Anuradhapura. According to the petition of the Petitioner and

P6 of the Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian Development of

Anuradhapura, an extent of over 30 acres is cultivated by 22

farmer families under this Wewa, and nearly 250 people depend

on the supply of its water for drinking, bathing, washing, brick

making, fishing etc. other than agricultural purposes.

1 Vide P6 and P10(a).

2 Vide paragraph 3 of the Petition.

5

The bund of the Wewa, which is about 8 feet wide on top, was

being used as an access road by the farmers and the villagers for

agricultural and related purposes. There has also been a line of

trees along the bund of the Wewa to fortify the bund.

When facts remained as such, on or around 16.03.2016 the

Petitioner had come to know that some people claiming to be

employees of the 9th Respondent-Road Development Authority

constructing a 30 foot wide road using heavy machinery over the

bund and reservation of the Wewa causing heavy damage to the

bund and the Wewa itself.

The Petitioner has tendered photographs marked P4(a)-P4(n) to

show the wanton destruction caused to the Wewa by this high-

handed, illegal activity. Those photographs, in my view, shocks

the conscience of anybody who loves our values, culture and the

ancient irrigation system, leave aside economic losses to the

farmer community. Photographs P4(a)-P4(g) show how a 30 foot

wide new road has been constructed using heavy machinery.

Photographs P4(h)-(l) show how old trees which were along the

bund have been uprooted in the process. Photographs P4(m)-(o)

show how concreate structures have been planned to be built

right inside the Wewa presumably for a bridge!

The Petitioner has obtained an expert opinion from a retired

Regional Director of Irrigation regarding the damage caused and

likely damage to be caused to the Wewa. This Report has been

marked as P12. It reads as follows:

(A) Spill approach area just in front of the spill inside the tank located at

the left bank corner of the tank bund.

6

(i) Partly constructed 4 numbers piers and 2 abutments with

reinforcement bars exposed. (presumed to be for a bridge)

(ii) Earth filling from either ends of the up stream of spill

structure inside the tank.

As a result of these constructions inside the tank,

(a) spill approach is not free and restricted, thus creating

an unwarranted increase in flood lift (ie. temporary

detention in the tank) than designed for during flood

situation causing bund failure due to overtopping, and

(b) a definite reduction in tank capacity as the filling is in

the tank bed.

(B) Down stream slope of the bund through the entire length has been

disturbed exposing the earlier formal bund with clayee material and

refilling with a gravel material which is not suitable for bund

forming.

(i) some trees have been cut and removed leaving the

roots as they were.

(ii) some clayee material have been removed from the

down stream toe of the bund and dumped elsewhere.

(iii) formerly 8 feet wide bund top width has been

increased to around 44 feet by dumping gravel

material on the down stream slope of the bund.

(iv) spaces created by removing some trees in the bund

have been filled with gravel material.

(v) excessive seepage flow was visible at the places

where down stream slope excavations are open yet.

(vi) some pieces of rock (rubble or boulders) have been

placed underneath gravel filling.

(vii) a field canal along the toe area of the bund from

the left bank canal (Goda Sorowwa) supplying tank water

to paddy fields has been completely covered with new

filling.

7

Following adverse effects could be anticipated owing to

above stated activities,

(a) as some heavy machinery have worked in the

area, certain instability could be originated in the

old bund due to vibration.

(b) the clayee material of the bund has been

disturbed and hence an increase rate of

seepage can cause failure of the bund.

(c) once the roots decay, cavities may develop

along these traces thus facilitating seepage

increase to cause failure of the bund.

(d) there could be a weak bond between the old

bund material and the new filling and this can lead

to slipping away a portion causing bund failure.

(e) some paddy fields cannot get irrigation water

from the tank as the field canal that supplied water

to these paddy fields has been completely

destroyed by now.

(f) now these seepage water can easily escape

through the newly introduced rock fragment layer

aggravating the seepage process.

It appears from P9 that some party interested in setting up a

purported Buddhist Monastery has carried out this wanton

destruction to the Wewa, which has been objected to, as seen

from P8(a)-(c), not only by the Petitioner Farmers Organization,

but also by the North Central Provincial Council of

Anuradhapura and the Chief Prelate of Anuradhapura

Atamastanaya.

The high-handedness and the manifest illegality of this activity

is clearly seen by the following letter dated 04.04.2016 marked

P7 sent by the 8th Respondent-Divisional Secretary of

8

Pandulagama to the 7th Respondent-Divisional Secretary of

Anuradhapura. It reads as follows:

This letter has been sent, as seen from P5(a)-(c), after repeated

requests made by the Petitioner inter alia to the 7th Respondent-

Divisional Secretary of Anuradhapura, the 3rd Respondent-

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development of

Anuradhapura, and the Head Quarters Inspector of Police of

Anuradhapura.

This is how the 2nd Respondent-Deputy Commissioner of

Agrarian Development of Anuradhapura has stressed the 10th

Respondent-Chief Engineer of the Road Development Authority,

by his undated letter sent in March 2016 marked P6, the

importance of the Wewa, and the legal requirements to be

fulfilled, if the construction is to be continued.

As the 10th Respondent-Chief Engineer of the Road Development

Authority has not complied with the legal requirements, the 3rd

Respondent-Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development

with the concurrence of the 2nd Respondent-Deputy

Commissioner of Agrarian Development has sent P10(a) dated

18.04.2016 to the 10th Respondent-Chief Engineer of the Road

Development Authority to stop construction until the necessary

approvals are taken from the relevant agencies including the

Petitioner. That letter reads as follows:

It is thereafter the 10th Respondent-Chief Engineer of the Road

Development Authority by P10(b) dated 27.04.2016 has sought

the consent from the Petitioner. By that time, the destruction,

as seen from the photographs P4(a)-(o), has been done!

15

The Petitioner has, by P10(c) dated 22.05.2015, rejected to give

the consent for obvious reasons.

Section 81 and 82 of the Agrarian Development Act, No.46 of

2000, as amended, read as follows:

81(1) Every tank, canal, watercourse, embankment, reservation

or other irrigation work, within the area of authority of any

Farmers' Organization, shall be subject to the supervision of that

Farmers' Organization.

(2) Regulations may be made setting out the manner in which

such supervision shall be exercised by a Farmers' Organization.

82(1) Where any government department, public corporation,

person or body of persons, proposes to construct a tank, dam,

canal, watercourse or commence any development project, within

the area of authority of Farmers' Organization, it shall be the duty

of the head of such department or corporation or such person or

such body of persons to inform the Farmers' Organization of the

proposed construction or project and invite its comments thereon.

(2) Upon receipt of the comments of a Farmers' Organization

under subsection (1), the head of such department or corporation

or person or body of persons shall forthwith inform the Farmers'

Organization whether and how he has taken into account the

comments of the Farmers' Organization in the finalization of the

plans for construction or the development project, as the case may

be, or why he has not been able to give effect to such comments in

such plan or project, as the case may be.

The duties of the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development are set out in the Agrarian Development Act, and

there is no necessity for the poor farmers or Farmers

16

Organizations to remind them to the Commissioner. Conversely,

it shall be the duty of these high-ranking public officials to

educate the poor farmers of their legal rights. I reject the

argument of the learned State Counsel who appeared on behalf

of the Respondents (without filing objections and without filing a

proxy) that, as the Petitioner Farmers Organization has not

specifically spelt out in detail the public duties the Respondents

have failed to perform, the Petitioners application shall be

dismissed in limine.

If I may quote the section immediately after section 82, it reads

as follows:

83(1) The Commissioner-General may, if it appears to him that

any person has:

(a) blocked up, obstructed or encroached upon or caused

to be blocked up, obstructed or encroached upon,

damaged or caused to be damaged, any irrigation

channel, water course, bund, bank, reservation tank,

dam, tank-reach or irrigation reserve: or

(b) willfully or maliciously caused the waste of water

conserved in any irrigation work: or

(c) without the prior written approval of the

Commissioner-General carried out any cultivation in,

or removed earth from or caused earth to be removed

from, a tank, canal within the catchment area or from

a minor irrigation channel, water course, bund, bank,

reservation tank, dam, tank-reach or irrigation

reserve, make an order requiring such person to take

such remedial measures as are specified in the order.

17

(2) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions

of an order made under subsection (1), the Commissioner-

General may seek the assistance of the Peace Officer within

whose area of authority such channel, canal, watercourse,

bund, embankment, reservation tank, dam, tank-reach or

irrigation reserve in respect of which such order is made lies,

and it shall be the duty of such Peace Officer to render such

assistance as is sought and the Peace Officer may for such

purpose use such force as may be necessary to ensure

compliance with such order.

(3) Every person who fails to comply with an order under

subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.

(4) A certificate issued by the Commissioner-General to the

effect that the person specified in the certificate has failed to

take the measures specified in an order made under subsection

(1) and committed the acts specified therein shall be prima

facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

This is only one section of the Agrarian Development Act

whereby the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development is

cast upon the duty of protecting irrigation work. I quoted it as

an example only.

The Deputy and Assistant Commissioners of Agrarian

Development of Anuradhapura by P10(a) has very politely

requested to stop further construction until necessary approvals

are obtained after the damage has considerably been done. The

Commissioner in P10(a) has referred to the steps that shall be

taken up under the Irrigation Ordinance as well. This letter has

been copied to the Provincial Director of Irrigation of

18

Anuradhapura also, but, regrettably, the said officer has taken

no notice of it.

Under the Irrigation Ordinance, No. 32 of 1946, heavy

responsibilities have been cast upon the Director General of

Irrigation and the Government Agents (District Secretaries) in

protecting irrigation work. In the instant matter, they have

conveniently turned a blind eye.

If I may, only as an example, quote section 65 of the said

Ordinance, it says:

65(1) Where any person obstructs or encroaches upon any ela,

channel, watercourse or tank, or causes damage to any ela,

channel, watercourse or tank or any irrigation structure connected

to such ela, channel, watercourse or tank, it shall be lawful for the

Government Agent, by notice in writing served on such person, to

require him within such time as may be specified in the notice to

remove or abate such obstruction or encroachment or to repair

such damage.

(2) If any person served with a notice under subsection (1)

refuses or neglects to comply with the requirements of such notice

within the specified time, or if there is any doubt as to who is the

proper person to be served with such notice, it shall be lawful for

the Government Agent to cause such obstruction or encroachment

to be forthwith removed or abated or such damage to be repaired;

and for that purpose it shall be lawful for the Government Agent

to enter any land or premises, with such workmen, instruments

and things as may be necessary, and to proceed to do therein, or

cause to be done, all such things as may be necessary for such

removal or abatement or repair.

19

In this case, the Divisional Secretary of Pandulagama, as a

responsible public officer, in a strongly worded letter addressed

to the District Secretary of Anuradhapura marked P7 (which I

quoted above), has sought instructions from the latter about the

steps he shall take to undo this illegal work. The District

Secretary of Anuradhapura, it seems, has thrown it into the

waste paper basket!

I issue the writ of mandamus against the 1st-8th Respondents as

prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition of the

Petitioner-Farmers Organization, which is: to carry out the duty

imposed by law under the provisions of the Agrarian Development

Act, No. 46 of 2000, and the Irrigation Ordinance No. 32 of 1946,

as amended. Mandamus was issued against the 8th

Respondent (who sent P7) to carry out the orders which would

be given in future by the 7th Respondent-District Secretary of

Anuradhapura.

The Farmers Organizations need not spend money and time on

litigation to protect ancient irrigation work. It is largely the duty

of the Respondent Public Officers to do so. The 2nd, 5th and 7th

Respondents shall pay a sum of Rs.120,000/= (each

Rs.40,000/=) as costs of this application to the Petitioner

Farmers Organization.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
