ORDER

P Pad man Surasena J

CA Imisc/06/2017

The petitioner in this application has prayed inter alia for following relief;

a) make order varying the judgment and interlocutory decree in the

case No: 1782/P of the District Court of 8alapitiya by excluding the

lot 4 in final plan 13/06 from the corpus,

b) or in the alternative to prayer (a) make order varying the judgment

and interlocutory decree in the said case No: 1782/P of the District

Court of 8alapitiya to include an order for the sale of lot 4 in the said

final plan 13/06 to the petitioner at the present market value of the

said lot 4,

c) make order staying further proceedings in the said case No: : 1782/P

of the District Court of 8alapitiya until the final determination of this

application

Admittedly, the Petitioner has never been a party in any of the previous

proceedings in the case pertaining to this application. Thus, it is correct to

8

identify the Petitioner as a total outsider to the proceedings he has chosen

to challenge in the instant application. Therefore, at the outset, this Court

must state here that it is not satisfied that the Petitioner has any locus

standi to challenge the proceedings he has chosen to challenge in this

application. This is so, particularly because the case pertaining to this

application is a partition action between some other parties other than the

Petitioner in the District Court of Balapitiya. This Court was kept informed

that even the final decree of the said case has now been entered.

This Court notes that section 5 A of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, has conferred the

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court

established by Article 154 P of the Constitution in respect of judgments,

decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a Family

Court within such Province and the Appellate jurisdiction for the correction

of all errors in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such District

Court or Family court, as the case may be.

The said Act also has provided that the provisions of Sections 23 to 27 of

the Judicature Act, No. 02 of 1978 and Sections 753 to 760 and sections

765 to 777 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written

9

law applicable to the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection

(1) by the Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a

reference to a High Court established by Article 145 P of the Constitution

for a Province and any person aggrieved by any judgment, decree or order

of a District Court or a Family Court, as the case may be, within a Province,

may invoke the jurisdiction referred to in that subsection, in the High Court

established for that Province.

Thus, it is clear that it is the forum referred to in the above provision that

any aggrieved person must approach for appeals or for revision

applications.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner sought to argue that the jurisdiction to

call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of first Instance

conferred on the Court of Appeal by Article 145 of the Constitution is a

jurisdiction different to the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. He

submitted that as the reason as to why the instant application has been

made under Article 145. He categorically stated that he does not seek to

support this application under Article 138 of the Constitution.

Article 145 is as follows;

r

10

" .... The Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or on any application made,

call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of First Instance and

in the exercise of its revisionary powers may make any order thereon as

the interests of justice may require . ... ff

This Court in the case of Vithana Kuruppu Arachchige Anura,

Municipal Commissioner, Colombo Municipal Council Vs Burns Trading

Company ePvt) Ltd., and four others! took the view that Article 145 is an

article which merely sets out yet another step this Court can take when it

exercises revisionary jurisdiction vested in it under Article 138 and that any

order that this Court may make when it invokes its power to call for, inspect

and examine any record will necessarily be in the exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction.

It is Article 138 of the Constitution which confers revisionary jurisdiction on

this Court. However, Article 138 requires this Court to exercise its revisionary

jurisdiction subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law.

1 C A (PHC) APN / 49 / 2017 decided on 2017 - 10 - 31.

r

11

The Supreme Court in the case of Weragama V Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya2 stated as follows; "However, the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction,

because Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions "of any

law"; hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to

be reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled to

exercise judicial power) ...... "

That is exactly what the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, has done through its sections. In these

circumstances, since this Court cannot exercise revisionary jurisdiction over

the subject matter pertaining to the instant case, even if this Court invokes

its powers vested in it by Article 145 of the Constitution, this Court is

denuded with jurisdiction to make any order thereon as such order has to

be made by this Court only in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction as

per Article 145 of the Constitution.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to refuse to issue notices on

the Respondents and dismiss this application without costs.

This revision application must therefore stand dismissed without costs.
