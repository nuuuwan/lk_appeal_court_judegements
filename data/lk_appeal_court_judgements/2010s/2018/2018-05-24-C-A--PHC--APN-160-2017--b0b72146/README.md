ORDER

P Padman Surasena J (PLCA)

The 2nd Respondent -Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the 2nd Respondent) had arrested two suspects on an

allegation that they were transporting timber without a valid permit, an

offence punishable under the provisions of the Forest Ordinance. They had

thereafter pleaded guilty to the charges framed against them. The learned

Magistrate had then convicted and sentenced them.

Learned Magistrate had thereafter taken steps to hold an inquiry to decide

the question whether the vehicle (which is the lorry bearing registration No.

NC PV 7952) should be confiscated or not.

At the end of the said inquiry learned Magistrate by his order dated 2017-

02-15 had confiscated the said lorry on the basis that the petitioner -

Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Petitioner)

who is the registered owner of the vehicle has failed to satisfy Court that she

had taken all possible steps to prevent this vehicle being used for illegal

activities.

Thereafter, the Provincial High Court has also refused the application for

revision filed by the Petitioner on the same basis. Petitioner has filed the

instant application for revision in this Court, to challenge the said order of

the Provincial High Court.

Evidence of three witnesses on behalf of the Petitioner including the

Petitioner herself had been recorded before the learned Magistrate. The

evidence of the Petitioner shows that there is only a cursory remark with

regard to giving instructions to her son who had driven the vehicle at the

time of detection.

The second witness called by the Petitioner, Subasinghe Arachchige

Chandrasiri is the son of the Petitioner who stood as an accused in the case.

It was his position that her mother who is the Petitioner, was not aware that

he was committing this offence. He has also stated that he has received

instructions from his mother not to do 'unwanted activities' with the lorry.

He had also stated that her mother gets on to the lorry to inspect it. This

evidence also only includes just a passing remark with regard to the fact

which the Petitioner was expected to prove in Court.

The third witness called by the Petitioner is an agent of the Central Finance

Company which is the absolute owner of this lorry. His evidence does not

5

relate to the question whether the Petitioner has had knowledge about the

commission of this offence.

In the case of K Mary Matilda Silva Vs P H De Silva, Inspector of Police,

Police Station, Habarana1, which is a case under the Animals Act, this Court

took the view that in this type of situation giving mere instructions is not

sufficient to discharge the burden placed on the owner. This Court went on

to hold in the said case that the owner of the vehicle must not only prove

that genuine instructions were in fact given but also took every endeavor

to implement the instructions so given. This Court in that case had held

that the failure to prove the above requirements would indicate that indeed

no genuine instructions had been given.

The burden of proving that the Petitioner did not have knowledge or that

she had taken all precautions is on the Petitioner. Therefore, the Petitioner

should prove this fact through evidence for the satisfaction of the Magistrate.

Section 3 of the evidence ordinance has defined the word 'proved'. It is as

follows.

1 CA (PHC) 86/97 Decided on 2010-07-08

'A fact is said to be proved when, after considering matters before it, the

Court either believes it to exist or considers its existence is so probable that

a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the case, to act upon the

supposition that it exists.'

Perusal of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Petitioner shows clearly

that the Petitioner has failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that a

prudent man ought not to have believed that the Petitioner has taken all

precautions to prevent the relevant lorry being put to illegal use.

Further, one must be mindful that in the instant case the Provincial High

Court was called upon to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. According to

the caption of the revision application filed in the Provincial High Court, it is

under Article 154 P of the Constitution read with the provisions of the High

Courts of provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 that the said

application has been filed.

Article 154 (3) (b) states that notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and

subject to any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province; .... ".

7

Section 5 of the High Courts of provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 has made the provisions of written law applicable to appeals and

revision applications made to Court of Appeal applicable to such cases filed

in the Provincial High Courts. Thus, chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal

procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is applicable to the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction by the Provincial High Courts as well.

According to section 364 therein, the Court can examine the record of any

case for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any

order passed therein or as to the regularity of the proceedings of such

Court. Thus, three aspects, which a Court could consider in revisionary

proceedings, have been specified by that section. They are legality,

propriety and regularity.

In the instant case there is no complain about the last aspect i.e. regularity

of the proceedings.

Moreover, when there is a right of appeal provided for by law, an applicant

in a revision application must show the existence of exceptional

circumstances for any intervention by a revisionary Court. Perusal of the

Petition shows that the grounds urged therein are not acceptable as

exceptional circumstances.

8

This Court sees no basis upon which the Provincial High Court could have

interfered with the conclusion of the learned Magistrate as the Court can

satisfy itself with its regularity, legality and propriety.

It is the view of this Court that the learned Provincial High Court Judge is

correct when he decided to refuse and dismiss the application for revision

fi led by the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, this Court has no basis to issue notices on the

Respondents.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this application without costs.
