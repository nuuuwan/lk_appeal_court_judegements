ORDER

P. Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Respondent - Respondent - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Petitioner) had filed this application seeking a revision of the

order made by the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in

Awissawella dated 2014-03-18. It is an order directing the learned Primary

Court Judge to enforce the order made by the Primary Court in respect of

an information filed in terms of section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act).

It is the Petitioner - Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) who had instituted this case in the Primary

Court qf Awissawela in terms of section 66 (1) (b) of the Act.

Learned Primary Court Judge by his order dated 2012-12-07 had concluded

that the Petitioner is entitled to the possession of the disputed property.

Upon an application being made by the Respondent to the Provincial High

Court seeking a revision of the said order, learned Provincial High Court

Judge by his order dated 2014-03-18 had proceeded to set aside the order

of the learned Primary Court Judge and directed the Petitioner not to

obstruct the possession of the property by the Respondent.

The Petitioner has appealed against the said order of the Provincial High

Court and the said appeal has been assigned the number CA (PHC)

59/2014 by this Court!.

In the meantime learned Primary Court Judge had refused an application

by the Respondent to have the order of the Provincial High Court dated

2014-03-18 enforced. Admittedly there is no order from any Court staying

further proceedings of this case.

Upon a revision application filed by the Respondent the Provincial High

Court by its order dated 2017-08-10, had directed the Primary Court to

enforce the order of the Provincial High Court dated 2014-03-18 on the

basis that the mere filing of an appeal against it does not stay the

operation of the said order.

It is clear from the above facts that the sole purpose of this revision

application is to get the enforcement proceedings in the Primary Court

stayed. This is apparent even from the averments contained in the

application filed before this Court.

It is to be observed that the Petitioner at no stage has challenged the

order dated 2017-08-10 pronounced by the Provincial High Court directing

the Primary Court to enforce the order dated 2014-03-18.

What the Petitioner has chosen to challenge in this proceeding is the

judgment of the Provincial High Court pronounced on 2014-03-18. It is

only after more than three and half years that the Petitioner had suddenly

entertained an idea to file a revision application despite the fact that an

appeal on the same issue is pending before the same Court. The Petitioner

has not explained the delay in filing this application.

It is trite law that when there is a right of appeal provided for by law, it is

mandatory that an applicant in a revision application must show the

existence of exceptional circumstances for the intervention of the

revisionary forum. However the Petitioner in this instance has not shown

any of such circumstances.

Another observation this Court has to make is that the Petitioner, although

seeking to obtain a stay order from this Court, has failed to fulfil the

obligation placed on him by rule 2 (1).2 This Court, in the case of E

Haffmann-La Roche Ltd. and A. Baur & Co. ePvt) Ltd. Vs. National

Medicines Regulatory Authority and four others 3 held as follows,

" .. It could also be seen that Rule 2(1) is a rigid one and that any petitioner

supporting an application for interim relief must do so with notice to the

respondents. This meaning could be gathered from the presence of the word

'shall' in Rule 2(1). It clearly indicates that giving notice to the respondents

is mandatory and stands as a pre requisite to supporting an application for

interim relief. Any applicant for interim relief must therefore necessarily

comply with it. It is not open for anyone to deviate from that provision ... "

It is to be noted that the Supreme Court did not grant leave to appeal against

the above order. It has dismissed the said application for leave to appeal.4

Section 74 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act has specifically taken

away the right of appeal against any determination or order made under

the provisions of its part VII. The primary object of proceedings under that

2 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

3 C A (Writ) Application No. 98/ 2016, CA minutes dated 2016-06-22. 4SC SPL. LA. No. 106/2016, decided on 2016-07-28

part is to prevent breach of peace amongst the parties disputing the claims

for possession of lands. The Court when exercising this jurisdiction would

take only a preventive action. The order that would be made is of a

provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a civil Court.

In any case, this Court in the case of Jayantha Gunasekara V Jayatissa

Gunasekara and othersS had held that mere lodging in the Court of Appeal,

an appeal against a judgment of the High Court in the exercise of its

revisionary power in terms of article 154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution, does

not automatically stay the execution of the order of the High Court. It

would be appropriate to quote the following passage from that judgment.

It is as follows;

" .... Obviously, to put off the execution process until the appeal is heard

would tantamount to prolong the agony and to let the breach of peace to

continue for a considerable length of time. This in my opinion cannot be

, the remedy the Parliament has clearly decided upon. Hence I am confident

that the construction we are mindful of placing by this judgment would

definitely suppress the mischief and subtle inventions and evasions for

continuance of the mischief . ... "

For these reasons one cannot find fault with the order made by the

Provincial High Court directing the Primary Court to enforce the order of

the Provincial High Court. It is to circumvent the said order that the

Petitioner has filed the instant application. It is the view of this Court that

in these circumstances it should not issue notices on the Respondents.

Therefore this Court refuses to issue notices on the Respondents. The

revision application must stand dismissed without costs.
