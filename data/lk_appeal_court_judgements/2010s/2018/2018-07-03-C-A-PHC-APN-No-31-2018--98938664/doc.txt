P.Padman Surasena,] (PLCA).

Court heard the submissions of the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioner and also the learned Senior State

Counsel for the Respondent.

Petitioner in this application seeks a revision of the

order of the learned High Court Judge pronounced on

01/02/2018. The said order has permitted an application made by

3

the learned State Counsel. The application made by the learned

State Counsel which is at page 56 of the brief, has been a request

for permission of Court, for the witnesses and the legal officer of

the Sri Lanka Transport Board to examine the documents before

the Registrar of the High Court.

Learned Senior State Counsel agrees before this Court to

implement the said order as if the learned High Court Judge has

only permitted the learned Senior State Counsel and the Legal

Officer of the Sri Lanka Transport Board to examine the relevant

documents before the Registrar of Court excluding the witness

who is under cross- examination at present

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner is contended

with this arrangement.

In these circumstances, this Court directs that the order

dated 01/2/2018 of the leaned High Court Judge be carried out as

4

agreed by the learned Senior State Counsel on behalf of the

respondent.

In these circumstances, we decide to terminate the

proceedings of this case.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

A.L.Shiran Gooneratne,l.

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
