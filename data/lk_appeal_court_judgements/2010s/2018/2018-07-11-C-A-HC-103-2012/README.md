ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The accused-appellant was indicted for committing rape on

Maddumage Misihamy and for committing her murder. After trial without a

jury, he was convicted for rape as charged but in relation to the count of

murder, the High Court convicted him for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. He was sentenced for 12 years of imprisonment and

a fine of Rs. 15,000.00 for each of the two offences and in default of the fine,

he was to serve a term of imprisonment of six months.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused-

appellant sought to have them set aside on the basis that the trial Court has

failed to consider the case presented by the prosecution, based purely on

items of circumstantial evidence, is incapable to support the inescapable

inference that he alone has committed these offences.

The prosecution presented evidence before the trial Court that the

90-year-old widowed deceased woman lived alone in the house in which

her dead body was discovered apparently by the villagers in the morning

of 22nd April 1999. Witness Susilawathie was her immediate neighbour who

made string hoppers for living. On the same morning of the discovery of

the deceased's body, the accused-appellant came to her house at about 7.00

a.m. and sat on a half wall in front of her house. He requested some water

to drink. The witness asked him to draw water from the well as she was

busy making string hoppers. The accused-appellant then told the witness

2

that the deceased was sleeping covering herself with several clothes. In

addition, the accused-appellant told witness that he had entered the

deceased's house by removing few roof tiles and left. She did not see him

thereafter.

The accused came to the witness's house for the first time that

morning and the witness has never seen him employed by the deceased

woman. But she knew him well as the person who plucked coconuts and

arecanuts in her village and was generally known as "Gas Nuwan".

After about 15 minutes, when the witness finished her morning

chore, she went over to her neighbour's house. There were several people

already gathered and she saw through a partly open window that the

deceased was "sleeping" covered herself with several pieces of clothing

including her face. She was lying on the floor, but would normally sleep

on her bed. Later the witness noted that several roof tiles were removed.

The prosecution also led the evidence of Alice Nona, a 73-year-old

woman, as she was the deceased's sister-in-law who regularly visited her.

According to this witness, she had complained to her that Gas Nuwan had

entered the deceased's house through the tiled roof and had removed

some packets of milk powder and a Cheeththa. She does not know the

identity of the accused-appellant. She identified a Cheeththa cloth shown to

her as one of the Cheeththas that her deceased sister-in-law wore. This item

3

of production was recovered upon the information provided by the

accused-appellant after his arrest from his house and the prosecution has

led that evidence under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The medical evidence revealed that the deceased woman had died

due to manual strangulation and the injuries seen in her genitals confirm

that there was vaginal penetration probably by an erect penis.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant was emphatic in his

submissions that the evidence of Susilawathie depicts an improbable claim

and it is due to the prompting by the prosecutor that she reluctantly said

that the accused-appellant told her that he got into the deceased's house

through its tiled roof. As admitted by the witness, there was no animosity

between the deceased and the accused-appellant and it was he who spread

the news around the village about the death of the deceased.

Learned Counsel then posed the question that, would the accused-

appellant, having raped the woman and removing some items from her

house, return to the same neighbourhood and confess about it?

He further contended that in the absence of any finger print

evidence or DNA evidence to link the accused-appellant to the incident,

these items of circumstantial evidence are insufficient to impute criminal

liability on him.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to counter the submissions

of the accused-appellant based on his admission of knowledge of the death

of the deceased and that she was covered with several layers of clothing.

She further submitted that there was no challenge to the evidence of

Susilawathie and there was no cross-examination of the evidence of Alice

Nona who identified a knife and a Cheeththa cloth that belonged to the

deceased and later recovered from his house. In addition, there was no

challenge to the item of evidence that the deceased had told the witness

that it was the accused-appellant who removed these, having entered her

house through its roof. Coupled with the admission that the accused-

appellant had entered the deceased's house in the morning, her body was

discovered, strongly suggest that it was only the accused- appellant and no

one else has had the opportunity to commit the two offences.

She also referred to the subsequent conduct of the accused-appellant

as he was arrested at about 2.00 a.m. on the 24th April 1999, hiding in a

jungle where he had spent the night. He resisted arrest.

The evidence placed before the trial Court had to be examined by

this Court in the light of the ground of appeal raised by the accused-

appellant.

It is clear that by 7.00 a.m. on 22nd April 1999, the accused-appellant

knew that the deceased was lying in her house covered by several layers of

clothing. He had admittedly entered through the tiled roof of the house.

He then informed the immediate neighbour about it. After a gap of 15

5

minutes, when Susilawathie went over to her neighbour's house, she found

there were already several people who have gathered and she saw the

deceased through a partly open window. The accused- appellant elicited

from this witness and the investigating officer that it was he who spread

the news to other villagers. However, the accused-appellant did not

accompany Susilawathie and the purpose of visiting her was to ask for

some water.

If one could see the deceased by the window, then there is no need

for one to creep through the roof to verify the condition of the deceased.

The accused-appellant did not say that he saw the deceased through the

window. If there were inquisitive villagers who have already gathered at

the deceased's house, then the accused-appellant should have got to know

of the death of the deceased prior to the villagers. This fact justifies

drawing an inference that it was the accused-appellant who first came to

know about the fate of the deceased.

It is also reasonable to infer that he came to know about it before

7.00 a.m. and before the villagers have gathered around the house. The

timing is important in this context. Susilawathi came to know about the

deceased through the accused-appellant and that was about 7.00 a.m. This

fact is consistent with her claim that she was making string hoppers for the

eatery in her village. The Consultant JMO, in his evidence placed the

probable time of death between 6.00 p.m. of 21st April to 7.00 a.m. on the

6

22nd April 1999. This could lead to an inference that the accused-appellant

may have entered the deceased's house when she was alive.

Since the accused-appellant was the first person to know of the

death of the deceased, then why he did not wait with the crowd and reveal

what he saw to the Police when they arrived at the scene by 9.00 a.m.?

Instead, he went missing until his arrest. He was sleeping in a jungle

despite having a house to sleep in the village. Then he knew whereabouts

of the Cheeththa cloth and manna knife that went missing from the

deceased's house barely a week ago.

The fact that the deceased told Alice Nona that the accused-appellant

has removed packet of milk powder and her Cheeththa cloth only supports

a suspicion entertained by the deceased woman about him. But this

suspicion was confirmed when the cloth was recovered from the house of

the accused-appellant after his arrest. The accused-appellant had

admittedly entered through the tiled roof in the very morning the

deceased had died and when he was examined by the Consultant JMO

after arrest, he had an injury which may have resulted in while creeping

through a roof as per his Medico Legal Report.

Learned High Court Judge, in her judgment was mindful that the

case presented by the prosecution is entirely a one based on circumstantial

7

evidence. She has correctly applied the legal principles that are applicable

to such a case as indicative by her reference to them in the judgment.

In Karunaratne v Attorney General (2005)2 Sri L.R. 233, this Court re-

emphasized the following principles;

"In the case ofState of V.P. vs Dr. Ravindra Prakash

Mittal(1992) 2 SCI 549, it was held that the essential

ingredients to prove guilt of an accused person by

circumstantial evidence are:-

1. The circumstances from which the conclusion

was drawn should be fully proved:

2. The circumstances should be conclusive in nature;

3. All the facts so established should be consistent

with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent

with innocence;

4. The circumstance should; to a moral certainty,

exclude the possibility of guilt of any person

other than the accused.

In the case ofPodi Singho vs. King 53 N.L.R. 49 it held

that "in a case of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the

trial judge to tell the jury that such evidence must be totally

inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must only

be consistent with his guilty. In the case of King Vs.

Appuhamy 46 N.L.R. 128, Keuneman I. held that in order

to justify the inference of guilt purely on circumstantial

evidence, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the

8

innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon

any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt. "In the

case of State of Tamil Nadu vs Rajendran1999 Cri.J. 4552,

justice Pittanaik observed that" In a case of circumstantial

evidence when an incriminating circumstance is put to the

accused and the said accused either offers no explanation or

offers an explanation which is found to be untrue, then the

same becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstance

to make it complete"

The Learned High Court Judge arrived at the correct finding by

applying these principles of law governing cases presented on items of

circumstantial evidence that it was the accused-appellant and no other

who caused the death of the deceased and who penetrated her vagina and

thereby committing the offence of rape. She has rightly rejected the

statement of denial made by the accused-appellant from the dock.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General did not challenge the conviction of

the accused-appellant for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and

therefore this Court need not venture to examine the validity of the said

determination by the trial Court.

In view of the above reasoning, it is our considered view that the

ground of appeal of the accused-appellant is devoid of merit and therefore,

the conviction entered by the High Court and the sentences imposed by it,

9

. ,

should be affirmed. Accordingly, we make order dismissing the appeal of

the accused-appellant. The conviction and sentences of the High Court are

affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
