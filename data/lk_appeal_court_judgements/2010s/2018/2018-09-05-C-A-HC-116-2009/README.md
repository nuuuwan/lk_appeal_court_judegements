DECIDED ON 31st August, 2018

****************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI T.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

is indicted for committing the offence of murder on Mohammed Kadeeja

Umma. After a trial without a jury, the High Court of Trincomalee found

him guilty of murder and was sentenc~d to death. In preferring this

appeal, the Appellant seeks to set aside said conviction and sentence.

The prosecution presented a caSE; based on circumstantial evidence

against the Appellant.

In support of the appeal, learned Counsel for the Appellant

submitted that the trial Court had erroneously convicted his client since

the items of circumstantial evidence are insufficient to establish his guilt.

He relied on principles laid down in the judgment of King v Appuhamy 46

N.L.R. 128, which are applicable to prosecutions presented on

circumstantial evidence.

2

1his ground of appeal requires an examination of the items of

circumstantial evidence led by the prosecution before the trial Court.

The evidence presented before the trial Court reveals that the

deceased is married to the Appellant and at the time of her death was

living with him and their married daughter. The house they lived in

consists of the front part and the hall with two rooms. The front part was

used by the Appellant to run a boutique and the other section of the house

was occupied by them. Only the Appellant, the deceased and their

daughter were living in that house and !he doors are locked from inside.

On the night of 11.04.2003, the deceased's daughter woke up from

her sleep as she felt thirsty. She went to the front part of the house to drink

some water and saw her mother fallen on the ground, just outside of the

front door, facing up. She noted blood where the deceased was fallen. She

then shouted for her father the Appellant who was sleeping on a mat close

to the place where the deceased was. She had to wake him up from his

sleep. Then the Appellant carried the deceased and cried. She states that

her mother was stabbed but did not know who stabbed her.

When she raised cries, her brother and neighbours have gathered

around and took the deceased to Hospital where she was pronounced

dead. The post mortem examination revealed that she has suffered a single

stab injury above her right breast which penetrated 12 centimeters into her

3

chest cavity with a downward slant causing injuries to her lung and heart.

Her death was due to excessive bleeding and damaged heart. The medical

officer was of the opinion that her death would have been instantaneous

considering the injury to her heart. He further expressed opinion that the

knife recovered upon the Appellants pointing to it could have caused the

single stab injury which resulted in the death of the deceased.

When the Police visited the house of the Appellant the next morning

after the death of the deceased was reported by the Hospital to them,

investigating officer observed that the hall of the house had been washed

just before he arrived, and he took charge of several items of male clothing

either washed or soaked in soapy water. These clothing had stains like

blood on them and the Appellant pointed out the knife in the kitchen. He

also noted blood like stains in the walls of the hall in which the Appellant

slept at the time of discovery of the deceased by her daughter.

When the trial Court ruled that the Appellant had a case to answer,

he made a statement from the dock. He denied any involvement with the

death of the deceased. He stated that the deceased was sad that her

daughter's marriage was heading for trouble and repeatedly claimed she

would commit suicide. He claimed that "when I looked, my wife was

fallen on top of the knife and she was bleeding".

"'.:.~/

The h'ial Court correctly rejected his statement from the dock. It is

clear that the claim of falling on the knife to commit suicide is almost a

near impossibility and is clearly an afterthought since it was not suggested

either to the medical officer or to his daughter. The daughter's evidence

was that she woke him up. But the Appellant claims that his wife fell onto

a knife, implying that he had witnessed the alleged act of suicide/ accident.

The trial Court had itemised the several items of circumstantial

evidence presented before it by the prosecution. When the prosecution

evidence is considered in its entirety, as the trial Court correctly did, it

satisfies the criterion laid down in Kin$ v Appuhamy (supra) as it was

held,

1/ in order to justify the inference of guilt from purely

circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of

explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of

his guilt."

In a more recent judgment of Karunaratne v Attorney General

(2005)2 Sri L.R. 233, this Court re-emphasised the following principles;

"In the case of State of v.P. vs Dr. Ravindra Prakash Mittal

(1992) 2 SCI 549, it was held that the essential ingredients to

prove guilt of an accused person by circumstantial evidence are:-

5

1. The circumstances from which the conclusion was

drawn should be fully proved:

2. The circumstances should be conclusive in nature;

3. All the facts so established should be consistent

with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with

innocence;

4. The circumstance should; to a moral certainty,

exclude the possibility of guilt of any person other

than the accused.

In the case of Podi Singho vs. King 53 N.L.R. 49 it held that "in

a case of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial judge to

tell the jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent with

the innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his

guilty. In the case of King Vs. Appuhamy 46 N.L.R.

128, Keuneman J. held that in order to justify the inference of

guilt purely on circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts

must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and

incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis

than that of his guilt. "In the case of State of Tamil Nadu vs

Rajendran 1999 eri. L.J. 4552, justice Pittanaik observed that"

In a case of circumstantial evidence when an incriminating

circumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either

offers no explanation or offers an explanation which is found to be

untrue, then the same becomes an additional link in the chain of

circumstance to make it complete"

The Apex Court, in its judgment of S.C. Appeal 232/2014 - S.C. M.

of 11.07.2017, quoted the same passage from the judgment of Supreme

6

Court of India in Tamil Nadu v Rajendran (1999) Cr. L.J. 4552 as the Court

of Appeal did in Karunaratne v Attorney General.

The prosecution evidence clearly points that only the Appellant the

deceased and their daughter was in their house that night. The doors were

locked from within. When the witness got up in the night, the deceased

had already received her fatal injury and was lying outside the house on

the steps. The Appellant was apparently fast asleep as she had to wake him

up. The medical evidence establishes that the stab injury could not be self-

inflicted. When the deceased was -ru~hed to hospital, the Appellant

remained behind. He did not reveal to any of the persons who gathered

around that the deceased fell on the knife. In fact, his daughter claims her

mother was "stabbed".

The blood like stains in the hall clearly points to the inference that

the deceased had received her stab injury inside the house. However, the

body was found outside of the house. There was no challenge by the

Appellant that the knife produced by the prosecution is not the one which

caused the stab injury. Appellant knew where the knife was and in fact it is

his claim in cross examination of the investigating officer. The dentures

worn by the deceased was found lying on a table broken and soiled.

All these circumstances points to the position that the deceased was

stabbed inside the house and was placed outside by someone. That

7

someone is the Appellant who pretended to be fast asleep, when his

daughter came out in the night. The Appellant has lied in his dock

statement by introducing a fiction that she fell on the knife. This is after the

medical witness clearly excluded suicide by self-inflicted stab wound.

It is obvious that almost all the lay witnesses were reluctant

witnesses who provided evasive answers in relation to the conduct of the

Appellant. Despite their reluctance, sufficient items of circumstances were

elicited by the prosecution, justifying an inference of guilt against the

Appellant. When he lied in Court, tJ:lat fact provided 1/ an additional link in

the chain of circumstances" as per Tamil Nadu v Rajendran.

In view of the above considerations, we are of the firm view that the

conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant should be affirmed. His

appeal is accordingly dismissed.
