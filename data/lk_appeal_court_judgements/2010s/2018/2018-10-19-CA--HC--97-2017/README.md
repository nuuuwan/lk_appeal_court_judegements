Appellant.

Haripriya Jayasundera SDSG for

the Attorney General

: 28th September 2018

: 19th October, 2018

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kegalle for

committing rape under section 364 (2) (f) of the Penal Code. After trial he

was convicted and sentence to ten years RI with a fine of Rs. 5,0001=

running a default term of three months. He was also ordered to pay Rs.

50,0001= as compensation to the victim with a default sentence of two

years.

The prosecution case was that the victim Nilmini was a grown up

woman but a mentally disabled person. A Psychiatrist's report was called

2

by High Court to ascertain her ability to testify in court, which had stated

that she is capable of testifying in court.

On the day in question she has been alone at home where she

lived with her father when the appellant Kaluwa had come and dragged

her into his tea plantation. She had said the appellant had sexual

intercourse with her but due to her disability she had failed to give the

exact date on which thi~, happened. When the father came home she has

informed him about the incident and he has told the aunt what had taken

place and the victim had been having a mistaken idea that the aunt saw

whaf took place. The father had gone to see the place where the alleged

incident took place shown by the victim and had observed that the grass

had been crushed. Father of the victim Nandasena while giving evidence

had stated the victim was of the habit of narrating everything that

happened while he was away from the house and that he could

understand her very well.

Nandasena had gone and confronted the appellant and then gone

and made a complaint to the police. By the time the police carne to inspect

the scene the appellant had got the scene cleared. This had been stated

in the police evidence.

." ~. .' .

Witness Seelawathi while giving evidence has said that the victim

told her about the incident and that she did not remember the month but

the date was a 18th on which day she gave alms to the temple.

On the 21 st of June 2001 the victim was examined by the Judicial

Medical Officer. While giving evidence he has stated that the victim

described to him that "Kaluwa" took her to the jungle and engaged in

sexual intercourse. He had said that merely because there were no

injuries he can not rule out that an incident had taken place a day or two

prior to the examination. He has also informed court that he observed that

the victim was not used to having sexual intercourse frequently. The

Psychiatrist had given evidence to state that with the kind of mental

retardation the victim could not have given a valid consent for sexual

intercourse nor could she have understood the repercussions.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the victim had

sexual intercourse with other men prior to this incident and due to a land

dispute with him his name had been implicated by the victim's father.

Having prior sexual relations with another man is not a ground for appeal.

The victim was not in a proper mental condition to give consent according

to both doctors therefore the question of giving consent does not arise.

::.., .

I \ :';" ~

There is no evidence tc SclY thrr~ ~1ad been a land dispute betweerl the

parties. These grounds of appeal have no merit.

. The counsel for the appellant citing the judgment in Sathasivam

murder case argued that the learned High Court Judge failed to

understand what subsequent conduct of an accused is. It is the counsel

for the appellant who has failed to understand the subsequent conduct of

the appellant and not the learned High Court Judge. The appellant after

he was confronted by the father had cleared the scene of the incident.

The father while giving evidence had stated very clearly what he saw this

piece of evidence is not contradicted.

The appel/ant's counsel cited the judgment in AG vs Priyantha CA

(PHC) APN 19/99 to say that according to medical evidence the appellant

could not have been convicted for rape.

This judgment is totally irrelevant to the instant case. The

circumstances are different and it does not apply to this case.

5

The learned counsel for the appellant failed to raise specific

grounds of appeal. No leg;)1 argument had been made by the appel/ant

to set aside his conviction.

For the afore stated reasons we are of the view that this appeal can

not be allowed. We affirm the learned High Court Judge's judgment

delivered on 31/05/2017 and affirm the conviction. Appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Achala Wengappuli J.

I agree.
