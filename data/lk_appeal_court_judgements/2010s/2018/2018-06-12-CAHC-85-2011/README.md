ACHALA WENGAPPULI I.

The accused-appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

The accused-appellant was indicted for abduction to murder of one

Warnakulasuriyage Nishantha and also for his murder on 21.05.2000. The

accused -appellant opted for a trial without a jury. After the trial, he was

found guilty to both these counts. He was sentenced to seven years

Rigorous Imprisonment for the charge of abduction with a fine of Rs.

25,000.00, in default of the payment of fine he was sentenced to six months

Simple Imprisonment and was sentenced to death on account of murder.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions and sentences, the accused-

appellant sought to challenge their validity on the following grounds;

a. the trial Court has misapplied the last seen theory when the

prosecution has failed to prove exact time of death of the

deceased,

b. the trial Court has misapplied the Ellenborough dictum,

c. the trial Court has erroneously used the dock statement to

support motive.

The prosecution presented a case based on circumstantial evidence

to prove the two counts. According to the prosecution, Katherine is a sister

of the accused-appellant and her husband has died four years ago leaving

their four children. The deceased was distantly related to them and was

about 17 or 18 years of age at the time of the incident.

The evidence before the trial Court revealed that the accused-

appellant has taken the deceased from the house of one Katherine in the

night of 21st May 2000, on his motor cycle while armed with a cutting

weapon. The deceased's body was recovered from a newly dug grave after

7 days. The body was in a putrefied state and its head was separated from

the torso. A strip of cloth was also seen around the neck area of the

deceased and his hands were tied behind using a thick rope. The lower

part of the body had a blue colour pair of jeans, which was later identified

by the witnesses as an item of clothing worn by the deceased when they

saw him last. The post mortem revealed that the deceased had died due to

strangulation. A sarong worn by the accused-appellant, when he took

away the deceased that night, was also recovered from the same grave

when the body of the deceased was exhumed. The accused-appellant has

evaded arrest and was eventually arrested after 70 days at a sand mine in

a different Police area. A sword was recovered by the Police under Section

27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Learned Counsel g the accused-appellant, in support of the first

ground of appeal submitted that the evidence led by the prosecution,

specially the medical evidence, only supports the fact that the death of the

deceased may have occurred 10 days prior to the post mortem

examination, which predates the date of offence and therefore the

3

imposition of criminal liability on the accused-appellant on the last seen

theory is clearly an erroneous conclusion reached by the trial Court. He

relied on the judgment of The King v Appuhamy 46 N.L.R. 128 in support

of her submission.

Learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondent in his submissions

referred to the admission marked at the trial that the body on which Dr.

Gnanaratne performed the post mortem examination is that of the

deceased. Then he invited the Court to consider the medical evidence on

the post mortem examination conducted on 29.05.2000 by Dr. Gnanaratne.

The medical witness was of the opinion that the death of the deceased may

have occurred about 10 days prior to his examination. When the

prosecutor questioned whether it is possible that the death of the deceased

could have occurred 8 days prior to his examination, seeking to include the

date of offence, the witness answered in the affirmative.

In addition, referring to the stomach contents of the deceased, the

medical officer was of the opinion the deceased had died after about less

than 2 or 3 hours since his last meal. He has founded this opinion on his

observation that he could clearly identify the rice and curries separately,

although in a semi digested state, in the stomach of the deceased.

Learned Senior State Counsel then referred to evidence of the

witnesses Katherine and Sunil where both of them stated that they had

dinner late in that night before they went to sleep. It was about midnight

4

when the accused-appellant barged into Katherine's house and took away

the unwilling deceased showing a sword.

In the light of these items of evidence, learned Senior State Counsel

submitted that the prosecution has established the time of death of the

deceased around the time he was abducted by the accused-appellant.

In The King v Appuhamy(supra), the Court of Criminal Appeal has

held thus;

"The prosecution failed to fix the exact time of death of the

deceased, and the fact that the deceased was last seen in the

company of the accused loses a considerable part of its

significance. The presence of rice and curry in the stomach of

the deceased also indicates a strong possibility that the death

took place some hours after the deceased set out with the

accused".

Their Lordships decided to allow the appeal due to several

infirmities in the prosecution case, including the one reproduced above. It

is seen from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal that the

deceased was last seen with the accused late in the evening and his body

was found only on the following morning. Post mortem examination was

performed on his body on the next day in the early afternoon. According to

medical evidence, "it was possible for the man to have died about 9.00

p.m." and had his last meal three to four hours before his death. But, none

of the witnesses spoke of the deceased having a meal since" midday". The

accused has taken up the position that the deceased has taken a meal after

5

i IIf II

he went with him and "have been killed some hours after he had this

meal." It is in these circumstances, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that

the prosecution has failed to "fix the exact time of death."

However, in the matter before us, there is evidence of deceased

having his last meal of rice and curry late in the night of his abduction. The

deceased has then slept in the house of Katherine with Sunil. The accused-

appellant has then woken up the deceased from his sleep at about mid

night and took him on his motor cycle. In these circumstances, the medical

officer's evidence that the deceased had died after 2/3 hours since his last

meal, places the time of death around midnight, the time he was taken

away by the accused-appellant. We are inclined to accept the submissions

of the learned Senior State Counsel in relation to this ground of appeal.

The second ground of appeal concerns the applicability of the

Ellenborough dictum to the case presented by the prosecution before the

trial Court. The accused-appellant contended that the trial Court has

considered the evidence presented by the prosecution under four separate

segments in applying the Ellenborough dictum and erroneously concluded

that each of these segments cumulatively presented a strong prima facie

case.

The trial Court, in considering the evidence placed before it, by the

prosecution has considered them under the following segments;

i. evidence in relation to motive

6

11.

iii.

IV.

evidence in relation to preparation

evidence in relation to opportunity

evidence in relation to subsequent conduct.

The accused-appellant's contention is that the evidence presented by

the witnesses negates any motive entertained by the accused-appellant in

relation to the commission of offences he was charged with. According to

the accused-appellant, none of the witnesses said there exists a previous

enmity between him and the deceased. Both the accused-appellant and the

deceased were related to each other and there was clear evidence that the

deceased went along with the accused-appellant quite willingly that night.

The accused-appellant further claimed that there was no indication to

suspect any untoward incident. In view of this, the accused-appellant

contended that the trial judge's conclusion that the accused-appellant was

angry with the 17-year-old deceased for staying with his widowed sister in

her house is not supported by evidence.

Witness Sunil, in his examination in chief, denied the existence of

any resentment between the accused-appellant and the deceased.

However, during cross examination he was questioned, whether he told

the Police of an incident where the accused-appellant has verbally abused

the deceased and the witness admitted it. It is evident from his evidence

that the accused-appellant was not happy with the deceased for his act of

leaving Katherine's two of her four children at her parental house. This

incident took place only in the previous evening. In addition, the witness

7

\ t I ! ,

f

also admitted that he was assaulted by the accused-appellant for visiting

his sister's house. Thus, it is reasonable for the trial Court to infer that the

accused-appellant was against any association with his sister either by

Sunil or the deceased.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant contended that the trial

Court has attributed a motive to the accused-appellant merely on

speculation. She relied on the judgment of Queen v Sathasivam 55 N.L.R.

255 in support of his contention that speculative motive is not admissible.

Considering the available evidence in its proper context, we are

unable to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel that the trial

Court attributed motive to the accused-appellant merely on speculation.

The accused-appellant also sought to challenge the conclusions

reached by the trial Court under the segment termed as evidence in

relation to subsequent conduct. The prosecution led evidence before the

trial Court that the accused-appellant was arrested 70 days later whilst

employed as a labourer in a sand mine which was located along the banks

of Kelani river in Dompe Police area. There was also evidence, led through

the Police witnesses, to the effect that despite several visits to the place of

residence of the accused-appellant, he was not to be found.

8

In addition, the evidence of Krishantha, the brother-in-law of the

accused- appellant, revealed that either in April or May 2000, the accused-

appellant came to his house on a motor cycle and having left it with him,

returned hurriedly in a bus without explaining as to why he is leaving the

motor cycle with him. The accused-appellant never enquired about it

thereafter. This motor cycle was later identified by Sunil and other

witnesses as the motor cycle used by the accused-appellant to take the

deceased away on that night.

Learned High Court Judge, considering the segment of evidence in

relation to subsequent conduct, concluded that it supports the inferences

she has reached under the other segments. This is a correct finding of fact,

in view of the items of circumstantial evidence reproduced above.

Learned High Court Judge, before applying the Ellenborough

dictum, concluded that the prosecution has established a strong prima

facie case against the accused-appellant. Then only she applied the

Ellenborough dictum on the accused-appellant. The accused-appellant

relied on the judgment of Wimalaratne Silva and Another v Attorney

General (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 103 where it was observed that;

"It must be emphasized that the Ellenborough dictum should

not be drawn haphazardly in order to bolster the sagging

fortunes of an otherwise weak prosecution case ... "

The clear identification of the sarong worn by the accused-appellant

by witness Katherine at the time of abduction of the deceased, connects him

to the grave from which the body of the deceased was recovered. This

sarong marked as P6, too was recovered from the same grave by the

investigators at the time of exhumation of the dead body. The accused-

appellant did not challenge this evidence nor did he offer any explanation

in his statement from the dock.

As already noted, in the instant appeal, the prosecution did present

a strong case before the trial Court and therefore its application of the

Ellenborough dictum is clearly justifiable.

In relation to the third ground of appeal, the accused-appellant

contended that the trial Court has erroneously considered the contents of

the dock statement as supportive evidence of the strong motive

entertained by him against the deceased when he disregarded the advice

not to visit Katheryn's house.

This submission stems from the learned High Court Judge's finding

that the accused-appellant's claim in his dock statement stated that the

deceased was sleeping with Katherine on a mat when he entered her house

that night is a lie.

10

rf

The accused-appellant stated in his statement from dock that he took

the deceased from the Katherine's house that night. When they reached his

motor cycle which was parked at some distance from the house, the

deceased opted to come in his push cycle. Then the accused-appellant

went away. Later he learnt from the Police that he is wanted in connection

of a murder.

In totally rejecting the dock statement of the accused-appellant, the

trial Court held that he has uttered falsehood in it.

This conclusion could not be faulted as Sunil in his evidence clearly

stated that it was he who was with Katherine when the accused-appellant

entered the house that night. The accused-appellant did not suggest to

Sunil during his cross examination that it was the deceased and not the

Sunil who was there with Katherine. The witness said that the accused-

appellant took the deceased on his motor cycle. This item of evidence was

not challenged. The accused-appellant however, said in his statement

from the dock, that the deceased opted the push bicycle. These assertions

could clearly be termed as an afterthought by the accused- appellant. It is

further confirmed, when he implicated his sister was in an immoral

relationship with the deceased. The trial Court also observed that the

accused-appellant has failed to offer any acceptable explanation through

his statement from the dock. The trial Court has totally rejected his dock

statement.

11

, , .

It is in this context that the learned trial Judge finally concludes that

his statement does not provide any explanation to the strong prima facie

case established by the prosecution.

In view of the above reasoning it is our considered view, that there

is no merit in the appeal of the accused-appellant. Therefore, the

convictions entered against the accused-appellant on 28th June, 2011 and

the sentences imposed on him upon the said convictions are hereby

affirmed.

The appeal of the accused-appellant is accordingly dismissed.
