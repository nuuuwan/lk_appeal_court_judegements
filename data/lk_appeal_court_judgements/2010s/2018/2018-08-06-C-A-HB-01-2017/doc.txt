ACHALA WENGAPPULI, I.

The Corpus-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the "Petitioner"),

invokes jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter alia; for the issuance of a

Writ of Habeas Corpus in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution and

Section 11(1) of the Extradition Law No.8 of 1977 as amended (hereinafter

referred to as the" Extradition Law") and to declare the order of committal

by the High Court of Colombo, made against him on 30th August 2017 as

null and void.

The Petitioner, who holds a Lebanese passport, was arrested at the

Bandaranaike International Airport in the early hours of 5th February 2017

when he presented himself to the Airport for his departure by the officers

2

attached to Criminal Investigations Department claiming that there was an

"International Red Alert" against him. On 7th February, 2017 the Petitioner

was served with a notice that the 1st Respondent had instituted extradition

proceedings against him at the request of the Government of the United

States of America (hereinafter referred to as the US Government).

In requesting the extradition of the Petitioner, the US Government

stated that the Petitioner is named as a Defendant in case No. 13M689

before the District Court of New York in August 2013 and a warrant of

arrest has been issued. During the proceedings before the High Court of

Colombo, the Petitioner was enlarged on bail and after an inquiry, the

High Court made the impugned 9rder of committal directing the

Petitioner to be extradited. Pending his extradition, the Petitioner was

remanded again.

Thereafter, the Petitioner sought relief from this Court by filing the

instant application in terms of Section 11 of the said Extradition Law. The

Respondents objected for granting relief to the Petitioner and an inquiry

was held after objections and counter affidavits were filed. The

Respondents, thereafter sought leave to tender further affidavit in order

to challenge the contents of certain documents that were tendered along

with the counter affidavits of the Petitioner and were allowed to do so.

Parties were afforded an opportunity to tender written submissions, in

addition to the oral submissions made before us in support of their

respective cases.

At the hearing of the application as well as in the written

submissions, learned President's Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner

3

contended that the order of committal insued by the High Court of

Colombo is bad in law as it had failed to consider that;

1. it had no jurisdiction over the Petitioner, since he is a citizen

of a third State and therefore he is not bound by the Articles of

the Extradition Treaty signed between the Governments of Sri

Lanka and United States,

ii. the Respondents have failed to discharge the required

evidentiary burden as per the provisions of the Extradition

Law in Sri Lanka in relation to the alleged complicity of the

Petitioner to the offences pe was charged with in the District

Court of New York,

iii. the Respondents have failed to identify the Petitioner as the

alleged fugitive Ahamed Fakih.

The submissions that the High Court of Colombo had no jurisdiction

to make an order of his extradition should be considered at the outset.

It is submitted by the learned President's Counsel that the

Extradition Treaty, entered into by the Governments of Sri Lanka and

United States, is only applicable to the citizens of the two countries as they

are the parties to it and it has no authority over citizens of a third State.

The treaty recognizes only two parties to it as its contents refers to

"Requesting State" and "Requested State". Since the Petitioner is a

Lebanese National who arrived in Sri Lanka as a tourist and not a citizen

4

of either the Requesting State or the Requested State, he could not be

extradited to United States as the treaty has no application on him. He

invited attention of Court to the fact that " ... the Petitioner alleged to have

committed the purported offences whilst he was in and within the

territorial waters of Lebanon" .

Learned President's Counsel placed heavy reliance on the Article 3

of the said treaty in support of his contention. He also relied on the maxim

1/ Exprassio Unius Est Exducio Alterius".

Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty states thus;

1/ Extradition shall not be r~fused on the ground that the person

sought is a national of the Requ~sted State."

In view of the said Article, learned President's Counsel submits that

1/ when the two contracting States specifically covenant to extradite their

own citizens, according to the core objective of the Treaty, and there is a

specific nationality clause to warrant the extradition of the citizen of the

Requested State, it has to be construed that the contracting States intend

only to extradite citizens belonging to the two contracting States and not

the extradition of citizens belonging to a third State."

Learned Additional Solicitor General in his submissions in reply

referred to the preamble of the Extradition Law which states that 1/ to

make provisions for the extradition of fugitive persons to and from

Commonwealth countries and foreign States ... "(emphasis original) and

therefore Extradition Law in Sri Lanka does not prevent extradition of

nationals of a third State. He further submits that the actual obligation to

5

extradite arises from Article 1 under the sub heading "obligation to

extradite" .

It is also submitted by the learned A.S.G. that" ... what Article 3,

which embodies the nationality clause does is, it creates a further

obligation on the parties not to refuse extradition on the ground that the

wanted person is a national of the Requested State. Therefore, what can be

clearly inferred this article is that, any person who is lawfully required to

face trial in the Requesting State is liable to be extradited under this treaty

irrespective of his nationality. In other words, he said treaty does not

preclude the extradition of nationals of even third States present in the

territory of the Requested State."

In the light of these submissions, it has become imperative for this

Court to consider the contents of the relevant Articles of the said treaty

along with the provisions of Extradition Law.

The bi-lateral treaty titled "Extradition Treaty" between the

Governments of Sri Lanka and United States, in its preamble states " ...

desiring to provide more effective cooperation between the two 5 tates in the

suppression of crime, and, for that purpose, to conclude a new treaty for the

extradition of offenders, have agreed as follows ... ".

The Article 1 of the said treaty is titled "Obligation to Extradite".

The Article 1 reads as follows;

"The Contracting States agree to extradite to each other, pursuant

to the provisions of this Treaty, persons sought by the authorities

in the Requesting State for trial or punishment for an extraditable

offence."

6

Plain reading of the said Article gives the impression to the reader

that the said treaty is applicable to " .. . persons sought by the authorities in the

Requesting State for trial or punishment for an extraditable offence." No mention

of nationality is found in this Article which forms the primary obligation of

the contracting parties. In Article 3 of the said treaty it is stated that

"Extradition shall not be refused on the ground that the person sought is a

national of the Requested State."

When these two Articles are read together, it becomes clear that the

scope of the applicability of the provisions of the treaty applies to "persons

.. sought by the authorities in the Requesting State for trial or punishment for an

extraditable offence" whether they are nationals of either of the contracting

States or not. If the treaty is intended to be applied only to the citizens of

the two contracting States, then the provisions of Article 3 becomes a mere

reiteration of the very purpose for which the treaty was entered into by the

two contracting States.

At the hearing before us, learned President's Counsel invited our

attention to several such bi-lateral treaties for extradition of fugitives

entered into by the US Government. In doing so, learned President's

Counsel emphasised that there are instances where the contracting States

have excluded their own citizens from the applicability of such treaties.

Learned A.S.G. has annexed the Extradition Treaty of the Governments of

Japan and United States to his written submissions. Common feature of all

these treaties is the reservation of the applicability of the treaty provisions

to their own nationals in varying degrees.

7

If the submissions of the learned President's Counsel on this point

are accepted then it would lead to the absurd situation where the

contracting States have decided to exclude their citizens from the scope of

applicability of treaty provisions and thereby leaving no person who could

be subjected to its provisions. If that is the case, then such a treaty simply

becomes a dead letter as the exclusion has effectively defeated the very

purpose of signing of such a treaty.

Coming back to the treaty between the Governments of Sri Lanka

and United States, when one reads the Articles 1 and 3, it is evident that the

intention of the contracting parties to have the provisions of the treaty to

apply to the class of persons descrjbed as /I... persons sought by the

authorities in the Requesting State for trial or punishment for an extraditable

offence." That forms the fundamental obligation between the parties. The

fact that nationals of the contracting States may also include in this larger

class of persons is indicative by the provisions of Article 3, which prevents

any of the contracting States to refuse a request for extradition on the basis

of it concerns a citizen of a contracting State. It is therefore clear that the

intention of the contracting States is to apply the provisions of the said

treaty on all /I persons sought by the authorities in the Requesting State for

trial or punishment for an extraditable offence" irrespective of their nationality.

Similarly, the statutory provisions of the Extradition Law No. 8 of

1977 makes no reference to nationality of the person in respect of an order

of extradition could be made. Section 6(1) refers to /I a person accused of

or has been convicted in any designated Commonwealth country or any

treaty State ... ". Section 7, which specifies the grounds on which a

Requested State could refuse to extradite a fugitive also refers to /I... a

8

person ... ". In providing a safeguard to such a fugitive, Section 11 provides

that" ... a person ... " could make an application for habeas corpus to the

Court of Appeal.

In Section 17(1) of the Extradition Law, a more explicit provision

which runs counter to the submissions of the Petitioner could be found.

The said section reads thus;

""Where a person accused of or convicted of an offence in Sri

Lanka, whether committed before or after the commencement of

this Law, is, or suspect:d of being, in any designated

Commonwealth country or 'treaty State, or within the

jurisdiction ot or of a part ot such country or State the

Minister may make a request to that country or State for the

extradition of that parson, ... ".( emphasis added)

Thus, it is clear from the above, if a fugitive who is concerned with

an extraditable offence, is within the jurisdiction of the Requested State,

and if Sri Lanka makes such a request, the liability to extradite that fugitive

arises for the Requested State, irrespective of his nationality. In the instant

application, the situation is reversed. The fugitive is in the territory of the

Requested State and the treaty obligates the extradition of that fugitive.

With due respect to the learned President's Counsel, in view of the

above reasons we are not inclined to agree with his submissions on this

point as it runs contrary to the provisions contained in the Extradition

9

Treaty between the two Governments and the provisions of the Extradition

Law.

The other challenge mounted on the order of the High Court of

Colombo by the Petitioner is that the Respondents have failed to discharge

the required evidentiary burden as per the provisions of the Extradition

Law in Sri Lanka as to the alleged complicity of the Petitioner to the

offences he was charged with in the District Court of New York.

In support of this ground, learned President's Counsel submitted

that in terms of Section 10(4)(a) of the Extradition Law there should be

evidence" sufficient to warrant his trial for that offence ... " and in Benwell

v Republic of Sri Lanka (1978-79) 2 Sri L.R. 194, it has been held that " ... the

standard of proof required is nothing less than a prima facie case" and that

should be established by the rules of evidence that are applicable in Sri

Lanka. The Petitioner further relies on the provisions of Section 608 of the

Criminal Resource Manual which also imposes a similar burden on the US

Government that it must satisfy the Court of the Requested State that a

prima facie case against the fugitive.

It is alleged by the Petitioner that "... the purported affidavits of

Richard M Tucker and James Edward do not adduce even an iota of

evidence to properly and independently establish the identity of the

Petitioner or the elements and ingredients of the offence ... ".

The Respondents state they have sufficiently discharged the

evidentiary burden before the High Court. In his submissions, learned

A.S.G. referred to the alleged acts of the Petitioner are criminalised by the

provisions of Sections 3(1)(e) and (9) of Payment Devices Frauds Act No. 30

10

of 2006 and thereby they have satisfied the requirement based on the

concept of dual criminality, that the offence on which the Petitioner is to be

extradited is punishable within the jurisdiction of the Requested State.

In relation to the complaint of sufficiency of evidence, the learned

Additional Solicitor General submits that the dicta in Benwell v Republic of

Sri Lanka applies to extradition proceedings among Commonwealth

countries. In this instance, the extradition request is by a treaty State and

the provisions that are applicable in this instance are to be found in the

Article 8(3)(c) where it is stated that the Requesting State to provide " ...

such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person to

be extradited committed the offence for whi~h the extradition is requested and is the

person named in the 'warrant of arrest. "

When the submissions of the parties on the question of sufficiency of

evidence are considered a question arises whether the treaty provisions

supersede the statutory provisions contained in the Extradition Law?

Answer to this question could be found in the provisions of Section 3

of the Extradition Law. It provided the Minister, upon publication of an

"Order" in the Gazette and with the approval of the Parliament, to declare

any "modifications, limitations or conditions" of the Extraditions Law in

relation to a treaty State, in spite of the provisions of Section 4 which

restricted the scope of such "Orders".

Article 9 of the treaty provides for the" Admissibility of Documents"

as it states, "the documents which accompany an extradition request shall

be received and admitted as evidence in extradition proceedings" and then

11

it lays down certain conditions which the US Government as the

Requesting State must satisfy in making a request.

Article 9(a) states as follows;

"in the case of a request from the United States, they are signed

or certified by a judge, magistrate, or an official of the United

States and sealed with the official seal of a competent authority

of the United States."

The resultant position then would be, if an accompanying document

to the extradition request satisfies the requirements of Article 9(a), then it

shall be received and admitted as evidence. Similar provisions are found

in Section 14(1)(a) of the Extradition; Law. Therefore, the accompanying

affidavits of Robert Walsh and Richard M Tucker are admissible evidence,

along with the documents annexed to them and marked as Exhibits A to E

and Attachments 1 to 3. They were the items of evidence presented before

the High Court in support of the extradition application.

It is upon this evidence the question of sufficiency of evidence

should be decided.

In the affidavit of Walsh, it is alleged that the person identified as

" Ahmad Fakih" operated two email accounts identified as

"darkyemail@yahoo.com" and "validshop@gamil.com" and the email

received by these two accounts contained compromised details of the

credit/ debit cards. The activities of these email accounts were monitored

by Walsh and his colleagues upon search warrants obtained through

Courts in the United States. It is alleged that "Ahmad Fakih" then

transferred such compromised details of credit/ debit cards to individuals

12

who purchase such compromised account information to perform

unau thorised monetary transactions called "carding". These details, too

voluminous and technical to be reproduced here and are found in the

averments Nos. 8 to 20 in the affidavit of Walsh.

Its suffice to refer to an instance mentioned therein as an example.

On 14th July 2011, email account .. darkyemail.@yahoo.com.. received

compromised information in relation to 410 credit/ debit cards. The illegal

processes by which this information is retrieved from computer networks

of financial service providers are known as "hacking" and "phishing". This

information then distributed to prospective buyers through another

account, which was identified as" th~ "primary means" to operate the

website .. www.validshop.su ... The connected email account to this website

was also identified as "validshop@gamil.com" and Ahmad Fakih was its

administrator. The prospective buyer of that compromised information

would then make plastic cards containing those electronic data and use

them to perform unauthorised monetary transactions.

The contents of the said averments clearly establish a prima facie case

against the person" Ahmad Fakih" for his complicity in committing access

device frauds as per the Grand Jury Charges under CR 1700119 (formerly

referred to as case No.13 M 698).

This finding warrants the consideration of the third ground upon

which the Petitioner sought to challenge the order of the High Court. The

Petitioner described it as an "identity crisis" as he claims that the

Respondents have failed to identify the Petitioner as the alleged fugitive

Ahamed Fakih.

13

In support of this contention, learned President's Counsel relied on

the fact that the Respondents merely obtained a print from the photograph

from the Facebook account of the Petitioner subsequent to his arrest to

secure his connection to the person known as "Ahmad Fakih". The

affidavit of Andrew P Yanchus that was tendered to High Court contained

these photographs. In addition, learned President's Counsel relied on

another fact which was tendered by way of counter affidavit to impress

upon this Court that one "Rami Fawaz" was indicted before the District

Court of Nevada for similar offences particularly in relation to illicit

transactions through the "validshop" account. The Respondents counters

this claim by the affidavit of Mark c Elrath.

The Respondents claim they obtained the photograph of the

Petitioner on 14th August 2011 through his email account, long before the

request for extradition is made. In support of the identity established

through a photograph, the Respondents relied on the judgment of In Re

N aresh Parsaram Butani (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 350 where this Court opted to

follow the judgment of R v Governor of Holloway Prison re Siletti (1902)

71 LJKB 931 which held /lthat a photograph may be sufficient by itself as proof of

identity if attested to by the witnesses in the Requesting State and is enclosed in

their depositions".

In the affidavit of Richard M Tucker, the attachment marked as

" Attachment 1" refers to a "photograph of Ahmad Fakih from an August

14, 2011 email received by the email account darkyemail@yahoo.com".

Attachment 2 refers to a "photograph of Ahmad Fakih from the Facebook

account in the name of 1/ Ahmad A. Fakih" and Attachment 3 refers to

"photograph of Ahmad Fakih from his Lebanese Passport". The affidavit of 14

James Edward referred to an affidavit of Tucker, who states that

photographs In Attachments 1 to 3 "are all photographs of the same

individual" .

Thus, the claim of the Petitioner of mistaken identity could not be

accepted as a valid basis to interfere with the order of the High Court. The

Respondents have provided sufficient proof of identity to satisfy the High

Court that the person who operated the two email accounts was known as

"Ahmad Fakih" and he is the person now held in custody by the Sri

Lankan authorities. The Respondents have thereby complied with the

requirements imposed by R v Governor of Holloway Prison re Siletti

(supra).

In the light of these considerations we are of the firm view that the

principle enunciated in the reproduced portion from the judgment of R v

Governor of Brixton Prison ex parte Schtraks (1964) AC 556, in the

judgment of In Re Naresh Parsaram Butani (supra) that II on appeal this

House can and must consider whether on the n1aterial before the Magistrate a

reasonable Magistrate would have been entitled to commit the accused but neither

a Court nor this House can retry the case so as to substitute its discretion for that

of the Magistrate" should be utilized to determine the Petitioner's

application.

The judgment of the House of Lords in R v Governor of Brixton

Prison ex parte Schtraks quoted Lord Russel of Killowen CJ where it was

observed that II we should after the order of committal, be entitled to review the

Magistrate's decision, not in the sense of entertaining an appeal from it, but in the

15

sense of determining 'whether there was evidence enough to give him jurisdiction to

make the order of committal."

When the order of committal issued by the High Court of Colombo

is perused, it is evident that the contention of the Respondents they have

established a prima facie case against the Petitioner is a valid one.

Therefore, we are of the opinion that there is no basis for this Court to

interfere with the order of committal under Section 11(3) of the Extradition

Law, issued against the Petitioner by the High Court. We are satisfied that

1/ there was evidence enough to give him jurisdiction to make the order of

committal" .

Application of the Petitioner is accordingly refused.
