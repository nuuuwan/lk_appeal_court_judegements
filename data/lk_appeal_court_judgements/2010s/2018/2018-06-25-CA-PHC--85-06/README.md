The Accused-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant')

was charged'in the Magistrate's Court of Kekirawa for committing the offence of

storing and being in possession of drugs without a valid permit contravening the

provisions of the Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Act No. 27 of 1984 punishable in

terms of Section 26 of the Act. A preliminary objection was raised by the appellant

before the commencement of the trial stating that in view of Circular No. 1819

dated 8th March 1994, the complainant had no authority to carry out an inspection

of the said Ayurvedic dispensary as the supervision of Ayurvedic dispensaries

came under the purview of the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine and should be

dismissed in limine. By order dated 4th November 1998, the Learned Magistrate

upheld the preliminary objection and discharged the appellant.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Attorney General filed a revision application in

the High Court of Anuradhapura on the 1 st July 1999. In order dated 12th December

:005, 1hc LC.:llned HIgh Court Judge held \'(~Lll ill,..; rt;::,polldcih and ordered the case

to be sent back to the Magistrate's Court for retrial. Aggrieved by the said order,

the appellant has filed this appeal in this court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that there were defects in the

respondent's application to the High Court. It is submitted by the Learned State

Counsel for the respondent that the imperative provisions of Rule 46 of the

Supreme Court Rules do not apply to revision applications filed by the

respondents (AG).

The absence of exceptional circumstances and delay of seven and a half months

has also been submitt~d as defects by the Learned Counsel for the appellant. The

State Counsel had made oral submissions to the effect that delay was due to the

3

fact that the Attorney General was made aware of the case only after a delay which

delayed the filing of the revision application. With regard to the absence of

exceptional circumstances and for the delay, the Learned State Counsel submitted

the fact, that the matter was not referred to the Attorney General within the

appealable period. However, the Counsel for the appellant submitted that no such

explanation was given in the petition filed in the High Court.

The Counsel for the appellant has submitted the following judgments:-

1. Rustom V Hapangama and company [1978-79-80 (1) SLR 352] the Supreme

Court held, "the trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary

powers of the Court of Appeal are invoked, the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available, only if the existence of

special circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of this court to

exercise its powers in revision".

2. Brt;retoil v Ratranhamy 42 NLR 149 tile prosecution'was sanctioned by the

Tea Controller but not by the Attorney General as required by Ordinance No. 11 of

1933. It was held that the absence of the Attorney General's sanction was not

curable under section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code and rendered the trial a

nullity.

3. A.Kanagarajah V The Queen 74 NLR 378 it was held that "a conviction of an

indictment of an offence punishable under section 76 C(J) of the Post Office

Ordinance was invalid in the absence of a complaint made by order of or under

authority from the postmaster-general. In such a case, the absence of the required

complaint was a dpfect wJ-t/:ch could not be cured by the application of the

provisions of section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code either to the

proceedings to the Magistrate's Court or to the proceedings of the District Court".

4

The Learned Counsel for the appellant also submitted that there were defects in the

order of the Learned High Court Judge as well. The Learned High Court Judge had

not given reasons for not complying with the provisions of the Supreme Court

Rules by the respondent.

With regard to the delay) the Learned High Court Judge has held th8.t a delay of

seven and a half months could be excused according to the judgement in the

following case.

In the case of Attorney General V Ransinghe and others 1993 2 SLR 81 it was

held that "(3) A delay of six months to make the application for revision of

sentence will not be considered unreasonable in view of the circumstances of the

case - see (6) below.

(6) the aggravating circumstances in the case were removal of the prosecutrix

when she was sleeping with her mother, the fact that she was very young (J 1 years

old), below the age wherp she tt'!ay consent to sexual intercourse, thp rlogree of

preplanning and the repeated commission of the offence for 2 days before the

rescue by the police".

In the case of Attorney General V Chandrasena (1991) 1 SLR 85, it was held "the absence of an affidavit by the Attorney General did not violate the provisions of Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules, as the Court was invited to decide only a question of law, and the relevant matters for that decision, have been admitted by the Accused-Respondent".

In the present case, the respondent had filed a revision application in the High Court of Anuradhapura to revise the illegal order made by the Learned Magistrate. Filing a revision application against an order which is illegal and contrary to law itself become an exception which walTants the respondent to invoke i.he revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. Therefore the Learned High Court Judge has called for the record from the Magistrate's Court under Section 364 of the Code of

5

Criminal Procedure according to law (under the provisions of the revisionary and appellate jurisdiction empowered to the Provincial High Courts by the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution).

'.

A circular does not prevail or override a legislation where it was not amended or

repealed by the parliament by way of legislation as a fundamental principle of the

Constitution. Therefore, the raid conducted by the Food and lJrug lnspector was

legal and was under his powers.

In the case of Soysa V Silva 2000 2 SLR 235, it was held that "power given to a

superior court by way of revision is wide enough to give it the right to revise any

order made by an original court. Its object is the due administration of justice, and

the correction of errors, sometimes committed by the court itself in order to avoid

miscarriage of justice".

Considering the above mentioned circumstances, the order of the Learned High

Court Judge to refer the case to Kekirawa Magistrate's Court to commence trial

~gaiIl~~ ill.:; J.F(.iCllunt is legal and within the pun'icw li[{ht; bw.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without costs.
