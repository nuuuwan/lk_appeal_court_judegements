CA 187/2010 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 10

It will be appropriate to narrate the facts of the case briefly as revealed at the trial. The

prosecution version is that Sirisena who is an illicit liquor seller from Urubokka area

had called the Bribery Commission and informed that the OIC of the Police Station of

Urubokka, the appellant is demanding money for not to file action against him and for

him to sell illicit liquor. The Commission laid trap and arrested the appellant on

accepting Rupees 5000/- The appellant's version is that one of the Commissioner Mr.

Nevile Guruge had a grudge against him and he presented a fabricated case.

Prosecution called five witnesses to prove the case, that including the Virtual

complainant Ranavithanthrige Sirisena, his son Ranavithanthrige Wasantha,

Investigating officers CI. Liyanage, PS. 29243 Kahatadeniya and SP. Palitha Bandara.

The Accused appellant gave evidence and called two witnesses namely SSP Gamini

Wijetunga and OIC Chandrasena.

Witness Sirisena who is also known as Kottawa Siri, gave evidence in court and said

that he is involved in selling illicit liquor (seeni karingjang) for about 17 years. He was

arrested by the Police on many occasions and been convicted more than 10 times. In

the recent times (period relevant to the indictment) he was approached by the

appellant and demanded money from him, and told him that if it is not paid he cannot

do his business. He submitted that he paid earlier to the appellant and felt he can't

pay any more hence he decided to complain to the authorities. Since he doesn't use a

phone he asked his son R. Wasantha to call the Bribery Commission, he called and the

officers came to him and laid the raid. On the day in question 13th June 2007 he was

given 5 marked Rupees 1000/- currency notes by the bribery official Liyanage. He took

it and went to the Police Station of Urubokka with an official Kulendran attached to

the Bribery Commission, in the pretext of employing him at his work place. They

discussed about the clearance letter to Kulendran and at the office room of the

appellant, there the appellant had asked what happened to that message ((fO o~ea>m

Gl:)))Gl5)>~ Then the witness replied saying I can't give Rs. 15000/- I will give Rs. 5000/-

and gave Rs. 5000/- to the appellant. (() ot8m~ 15000 1m mo&> m&> Gt;.~m &It(5)t

5000 a;) Of;.~i5) ~GI@ ot8G1S 5000 a;) ~~i5)) The appellant took it in his hand and put it,

in the table drawer. At that time Kulendran left the room and signalled the others to

come, they entered the office room of the appellant, after identifying CI Liyanage took

the money from the drawer. This witness admitted that he had many cases in the court

and he was convicted on many occasions. 10 days prior to this incident he was raided

by the Police officers attached to Urubokka Police Station for possession of about 25

litres of illicit liquor. His son Wasantha was arrested for another offence previously.

Chief Inspector Liyanage who was the team leader in the raid testified before the court

and submitted that Kulendran was a Police officer attached to the Bribery Commission.

He was a member in the team which was involved in this investigation. He was detailed

to accompany the virtual complainant and he took part and made relevant notes,

subsequently he had left the department and presently residing overseas.

The first ground of appeal is that the decoy didn't give evidence hence the conviction

could not stand.

It is appropriate to see who is a decoy. According to the definition by Merriam-

Webster;

lure, entice, inveigle, decoy, tempt, seduce mean to lead astray from one's true

course. lure implies a drawing into danger, evil, or difficulty through attracting

and deceiving. (lured naive investors with get-rich-quick schemes) entice suggests

drawing by artful or adroit means. (advertising designed to entice new customers)

inveigle implies enticing by cajoling or flattering. (fund-raisers inveigling wealthy

alumni) decoy implies a luring into entrapment by artifice. (attempting to decoy

the enemy into an ambush) tempt implies the presenting of an attraction so

strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or better judgment. (tempted

by the offer of money) seduce implies a leading astray by persuasion or false

promises. (seduced by assurances of assistance)

Decoy is also defined at another place as;

"a person who entices or lures another person or thing, as into danger, a trap, or

the like"

Chambers Thesaurus, New Edition 1988, Defines as follows;

Decoy - (n) attraction, bait, ensnarement, enticement, inducement, lure, pretence,

roper(-in), shill, trap. Inveigle, lead, lure, seduce, tempt.

(V) allure, attract, bait, beguile, deceive, draw, ensnare, entice, entrap. entice

Macmillan English Dictionary for advanced learners (New edition, second edition

2007) Defines as follows;

"a person or thing that you use to trick someone into going somewhere or doing

something . .... "

The word decoy is common for both animals and human beings whenever the purpose

of their employment is to trap someone else. Hence, a decoy witness is a person who

is employed by investigating agencies to bring culprits into trap. It is an easy and

efficacious manner resorted to in a number of jurisdictions to bring to justice such

criminals who are otherwise successfully evading process of law.

It is important to differentiate a decoy from accompanying witness. Decoy is a person

who is involved in the transaction, accompanying witness is a person who goes with

the decoy or person in concern to witness the transaction.

In this case, as per the evidence, persons involved are, the appellant and the virtual

complainant R. Sirisena, Kulendran was there in the pretext of getting clearance for

employment. The alleged transaction was related to the illicit liquor business, nothing

related to the employment clearance of Kulendran. Considering the available evidence

submitted before the High Court and the submissions of Counsels before the Trial

court and appellate court we conclude that Kulendran is not a decoy as defined in the

dictionary and decided case laws.

Considering the available materials, we conclude he is not an accomplice, he is a

person sent by Bribery investigators to observe and corroborate the virtual

complainant.

The available evidence reveals that the virtual complainant Sirisena had gone with

Kulendran into the office room of the appellant. As we concluded earlier that

Kulendran is not a Decoy, hence there are two witnesses apart from the appellant to

speak what happened in the office room. This will bring us to a point of acceptability

of the evidence of Sirisena. The evidence Ordinance and other case laws will govern

and guide the Judge. In this case the trial judge had found the evidence of the witness

Sirisena can be relied upon. Further this witness was independently corroborated by

many other factors such as recovery of money from the drawer of the appellant's table

which was occupied by the appellant.

Credibility of the virtual complainant R. Sirisena is challenged by the appellant in the

original court. It is the content of the appellant that this witness is involved in selling

illicit liquor and he has previous convictions therefore, he is unreliable.

Then the next question arise can a Judge depend on a single witness to convict an

accused. Time and again this was discussed by Courts, Legislators and other forums.

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance clearly provides answer to this question.

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof

of any fact.

In Sunil vs Attorney General 1999 (3) Sri LR191, F.N.D. Jayasuriya J held,

"There appears to be a misgiving among trial Judges in bribery court that the

testimony of a witness in bribery prosecution is required to be corroborated

before it could be acted upon; such a proposition is a manifest error of law. "

[Emphasis added]

Earlier days, in rape cases, character of the victim was a material fact, but now it had

changed and the law has developed to the extent to protect animals, fauna and flora

even things without life. Courts held, that prostitutes also can be subject to rape.

Recognition of human values and rights, made the courts to decide the incident

(offence) not the persons involved. It is immaterial on whom by whom it is committed.

In this case the test is whether the witness is reliable to accept his evidence. Therefore,

the court cannot be told to reject because he was involved in illicit liquor trade nor he

has previous convictions.

Considering the reasons given by the trial judge and the evidence before the court, we

find that the witness was not contradicted or found fault on material points. Therefore,

we agree with the trial judge in accepting the evidence of Sirisena.

The appellant submits that the trial judge has not considered defence documents

marked V1 to V8. It will be appropriate to list down all those documents for easy

reference.

a) V1 - Charge Sheet against R. Sirisena, in Morawaka MC case 86500 (Page 87 of

the brief) Marked through Sirisena and produced on 9/9/2009)

b) V2 - B Report against Wasantha at MC Morawaka case number 95641 (at page

c) V3- First B report of this case filed by CI Liyanage at MC Morawaka number B

d) V4- Entry made by Nelie Guruge on the Bribery office file dated 11/06/2007,

(Page 136, produced through CI Liyanage on 11/05/2010)

CA 187/2010 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 10

e) Vs-Contradiction marked on ASP Palitha Bandara (Page 187 date

f) V6 - Sirisena Pleaded guilty on a charge and fined Rs. 51000/-9Page 197,

g) V7 - Entry dated 09/03/2007 made by appellant regarding Nevile Guruge's

phone call (Page 200, marked and produced through the appellant on

28/06/2010)

h) V8 - Certified copy MC Morawaka case number 95641 assault regarding a land

dispute of Gamini wasantha (page 207 marked and produced by the appellant

on 28/06/2010).

The above list shows the documents and its details, we perused the said documents,

evidence and the reasons given by the trial judge and we conclude, that the learned

High Court Judge has considered these documents and concluded that there is no

reasonable doubt was created, we have no reason to interfere with his findings.

The final grounds of appeal of the appellant is the High Court Judge failed to consider

the motive, for Sirisena make this complaint.

It is a proven fact that the virtual complainant Sirisena was involved in the trade of

illicit liquor for more than 17 years. He had been arrested on many occasions and

convicted more than 10 times. So, arrest by the appellant is not a new thing. On one

hand, the witness may have had the reason or even vengeance to complain against

the appellant. On the other hand, as he claims in his evidence, it had become

unbearable to give money to the appellant, for him to make the complaint to the

bribery commission.

Anyhow the witness when this was suggested to him he categorically denied it and

said it had become unbearable to make "payment" and to run his "business", made him

to make the complaint to the Bribery Commission. The learned trial judge after

evaluating all the evidence and the circumstances accepted the evidence of the virtual

complainant Sirisena.

The appellant also submitted, that the commissioner in charge of investigations Mr.

Nevile Guruge, had a grudge on the appellant was the cause of this investigation. This

matter had extensively dealt by the trial judge, we also perused the evidence and

documents before the court. After careful consideration, we have no reason to

interfere with findings of the trial judge.

Considering all the submissions, evidence, documents and the judgement we find that

there is no merit in the grounds of appeal hence we conclude that the conviction is

acceptable and we have no reasons to interfere with the same. Hence we affirm the

conviction.

We draw our attention to the sentence imposed, considering the gravity of the offence

we find the sentence is very lenient.

It is disheartening to note, that time and again the law makers, Courts and the public

had expressed serious concern on bribery cases. As it claimed it is cancer to the society.

All of us talk about it but when it comes to implementation we take the side of the

convict and not the society at large.

In this case mitigatory circumstances submitted by the accused were; he has no

previous convictions, his wife is sick, children are studying. The appellant is a Police

officer serving the government, he cannot have any previous conviction, it is

mandatory so, this cannot be a mitigatory circumstance. Informing court that Wife is

not well, children are studying are mere submissions, there is no evidence before the

court. Hence this cannot be considered as a mitigating factor.

The learned trial Judge had invited his attention to the guidance given by the Supreme

Court in reference number 3 of 2008 and imposed 1-year Rigorous Imprisonment on

the 1 st and 3rd count and suspended the same for a period of 10 years, and a fine of

Rs. 5000/- in default 3 months simple imprisonment. In laymen's view other than losing

the job the appellant is not getting a substantial punishment. One of the purpose for

sentencing is deterrent, which is not present here.

Anyhow the sentence was imposed on 22/11/2010 and the Respondent state agency

had not appealed or moved in revision against the sentence. Further the counsel for

the respondent did not make any application to enhance the sentence. Therefore, we

are not revising the sentence at this juncture, anyhow we place on record of our

concern for the trial judges and the Respondent to be mindful in the future.

Appeal dismissed.
