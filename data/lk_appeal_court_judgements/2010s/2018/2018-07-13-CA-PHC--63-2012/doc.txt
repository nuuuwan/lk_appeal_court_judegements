This is an appeal by the 1st Party Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) against the order of the learned

High Court Judge of the Western Province holden in Panadura dated 25.06.2012 by which she

dismissed the revision application filed by the Appellant.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent reported facts to the Magistrate of Moratuwa under

section 66(1) of the Primary Procedure Code Act. It was reported that a boundary dispute had

arisen between the Appellant and the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent (Respondent).

The learned Magistrate after inquiry delivered order on 27.04.2012 permitting the Respondent

to hold possession of the land in dispute.

The Appellant preferred a revision application to the High Court of Panadura in case no. RA

17/2012 on 22.06.2012 and sought to support the application in open court on 02.07.2012. The

journal entry dated 25.06.2012 is evidence of the said application.

However, the learned High Court Judge had, without calling the matter in open court on

02.07.2012 as requested by the Appellant, made order in chambers on 25.06.2012 dismissing the

revision application. The reasons given was that the Appellant had failed to disclose reasons for

the delay in filing the petition, the petition has failed to disclose that reliefs sought in the revision

application cannot be obtained in a civil action, there was an alternative remedy for the Appellant

and that no exceptional circumstances are set out in the petition. Hence this appeal by the

Appellant.

The fundamental question that arises for determination is whether it was competent for the

learned High Court Judge to have made the impugned order in chambers without hearing the

Appellant in support of the revision application.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary objection that this Court cannot

entertain the appeal because the dispute has been gone into in the District Court in a partition

action and an appeal lodged against the judgement which is pending.

Two issues engage my mind on the fundamental question.

Firstly, Article 106(1) of the Constitution mandates that the sittings of every court established

under the Constitution or ordained and established by Parliament shall subject to the provision

of the Constitution be held in public, and all persons shall be entitled freely to attend such sittings.

The rule requiring public sittings is a fundamental constitutional provision in the exercise of

judicial power as in terms of Article 4(c) of the Constitution it is the judicial power of the people

that is exercised by Courts. There can be no doubt that the people whose judicial power is

exercised by Courts should have unimpeded access to court sittings. The exception to this rule is

found in Article 106(2) of the Constitution which has no application to the instant matter.

In Piyasena De Silva and Others v. Ven. WimaJawansa Thera and another [(2006) 1 SrLl.R. 219]

the Supreme Court held that the failure of a single judge, who made order in chambers refusing

an application to intervene, to hear parties infringed Article 106 (1) of the Constitution which

requires "public sittings" save in exceptional cases and as such the order made by a single judge

sitting in chambers was invalid. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in concluding that the learned

Page 3 of 6

High Court Judge violated a fundamental constitutional provision which guides the exercise of

judicial power of the people and as such the order dated 25.06.2012 is illegal and must be set

aside.

Secondly, the learned High Court Judge has blatantly disregarded one important aspect of the

rules of natural justice which has profound root in our legal system. It was a basic principle of

law in medieval Sri Lanka that a decision should be given only after both parties to a dispute had

been heard: ubhaya paksayen ma adyanta asa ganna dadek da. [A.R.B. Amerasinghe, The Legal

Heritage of Sri Lanka, p. 211 citing Saddharmaratanavaliya, page 365].

"In general, however, a judge cannot decide a matter without hearing the parties; nor maya

judge decide a matter before hearing both parties to a dispute, for, it is 'an indispensable

requirement of justice that the party who has to decide shall hear both sides, giving each an

opportunity of hearing what is urged against him." [Erie C.J. in Re. Braok (16 CB NS 416)]

There are instances where the law does provide for the making of ex parte orders such as Rule

2(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 and sections 84 and 87 of the Civil

Procedure Code or sections 148(4), 188, 192, 241, 325 and 326 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

where the party has failed to exercise his right to be heard. In the absence of such statutory

exceptions, a judge must hear all parties to a dispute before making any order. A statutory

exception for the need to hear both parties is not present in the instant case. In fact, the learned

High Court Judge did not hear any party before making the impugned order.

In Piyasena De Silva and Others v. Ven. Wimalawansa Thera and another (supra) the Supreme

Court held that for the reason that the failure to hear the parties was contrary to natural justice

constituted a failure of a fair hearing for which the appellant had a legitimate expectation, the

order made in chambers was invalid. For the same reasons, I am of the view that the order dated

25.06.2012 made by the learned High Court Judge is illegal and must be set aside.

Page 4 of 6

Unfortunately, this is not the first time that a blatant breach of a fair hearing is reported to have

occurred in the High Court. In Rupathunga v. Attorney General and another [(2009) 1 SrLL.R. 170]

Ranjith Silva J. stated:

"It is pathetic to note that the High Court Judge has not even been mindful of Section 14

and Section 15 of the Bail Act when she made the impugned order. These are orders which

could be founded as capricious, arbitrary and unjust ... what shocks the conscience of this

Court is that the High Court Judge has not even cared to provide an opportunity to the

accused, at least to show cause as to why bail should not be cancelled instead has

considered some extraneous matters which are not even covered by Section 14 and has

rushed to the conclusion that bail should be cancelled which I shall say is indecent".

Justice Ranjith Silva in fact went on to direct the Registrar of the Court of Appeal to forward

copies of his order to the Secretary to His Lordship Hon. Chief Justice and the Secretary to the

Judicial Services Commission.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that this Court is entitled to go into the merits

of the revision application filed before the High Court of Panadura and make order thereon.

Having given my anxious consideration to this submission I am of the view that legally it is not

permissible to do so. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the merits of the revision

application made by the Appellant. In these circumstances, this Court will be usurping the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court by examining the merits of the application when the

High Court has not done so. Such a course of action on the part of this Court will also deprive a

party the right of appeal it has against the order of the High Court on the merits of the application.

I am of the view that the preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Respondent

that this Court cannot entertain the appeal because the dispute has been gone into in the District

Court in a partition action and an appeal lodged against the judgement which is pending is not a

matter that we must determine given the reasons set out above. That objection may, if the

Respondent so wishes, be raised before the High Court when the revision application filed by the

Appellant is considered by the High Court.

Page 5 of 6

For the reasons set out above, I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Western Province holden in Panadura dated 25.06.2012.

The maxim "actus curiae neminem gravabit" means that an act of Court shall prejudice no one,

becomes applicable in the instant case as the Appellant has been forced to litigate in the

appellate forum for over 6 years due to a blatant and fundamental mistake made by the learned

High Court Judge. In such a situation the Court is under an obligation to undo the wrong done to

a party by the act of Court. This must of course be done within what is permissible in law. In the

instant case, the best that this Court can do is to direct the learned High Court Judge of Panadura

to expeditiously hear and determine the revision application filed by the Appellant giving it

priority over all other cases pending in the said Court.

The revision application is partly allowed. The Appellant is entitled to the costs of this application.
