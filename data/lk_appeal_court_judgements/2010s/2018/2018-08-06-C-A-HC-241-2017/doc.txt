Accused - Appellant.

A.R.H. 8ary S.S.C. for the

: 25th July, 2018

: 06th August, 2018

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for an

offence punishable under section 367 of the Penal Code. After trial he

was convicted under section 395 and sentenced to five years RI. He was

acquitted on the first and second charges.

2

The appellant had been working for the Rupavahini Corporation on

a technical job. The appellant was arrested on suspicion for theft of some

copper metal rods. The metal was recovered from a scrap metal shop.

The owner of the said shop has identified the appellant and has said that

he brought pieces of copper to sell to his shop, on several occasions.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the metal taken

into custody from the shop was not proved as stolen property from the

Rupavahini Corporation by the prosecution. The owner of the metal shop

(vide page 136-137 of the brief) has stated in evidence that the appellant

came to his shop on several occasions to sell pieces of metal. He has

identified the appellant as the person who came to sell piece of metal

rods. On this evidence the first point of argument of the appellant's

counsel fails.

The next point of argument was that the conviction was bad in law

as it was not proved by the prosecution that the goods recovered were

stolen property. He cited the judgment in AG vs Oewapriya Walgamage

and another 1990 2 SLR 212. This judgment is not relevant to the instant

case.

3

The appellanfs counsels' next point of argument was that section

395 conviction is bad in law. He said to be a habitual offender it has to

prove that he did this habitually. Citing the definition in the Oxford

Dictionary the counsel argued the word habitual means "done constantly"

or "as a habit, regular usual, given to a special habit". The owner of the

Metal shop from where P1 and P2 were recovered has given evidence to

say that the appellant came to his shop several times with pieces of metal

to sell. This shows that the appel/ant has been going to this shop to sell

metal constantly.

The argument that the prosecution failed to prove that the ball of

copper marked as P2 was made out of the 32 meter long cable which

was alleged to have been stolen from the Rupuvahini Corporation by the

appellant. He argued that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider

this and shifted the burden of proof to the appellant. He cited the judgment

in Gunasekera vs AG 79 NLR 348 and interpreting section 114 (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance said evidence which could be and not produced

would if produced be unfavorable to the person who withholds it. This

argument is totally out of context to this case.

4

The appellant in his Dock statement has made a total denial when

there has been a strong prima - facie case against him. The appellant

has failed to explain on the third charge for which he was convicted.

On perusal of the judgment given by learned High Court Judge it is

quite clear that the learned High Court Judge has carefully analysed the

evidence placed before the High Court. This court is not inclined to set

aside a judgment which has been delivered after careful consideration.

For the afore stated reasons we affirm the judgment and the

conviction dated 08/06/2017 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
