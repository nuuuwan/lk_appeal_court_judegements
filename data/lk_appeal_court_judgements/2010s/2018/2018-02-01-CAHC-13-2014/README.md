Saliya Pieris P.C. with Pasindu Thilakaratne for The Accused-Respondent.

s. THURAIRAJA, PCJ.

This matter is taken up for argument. Mr. Saliya Pieris,

President's Counsel raises a preliminary objection at the very outset and

submits that the appeal is contrary to Section 15 of the Judicature

Act No.2 of 1978 and he submits that Section lS(a)(ii) is the operative

section reads follows:-

"On a question of fact alone or on a question of mixed law and fact

with leave of the Court of Appeal first had an obtained in a trial

without a jury."

In this case, there is no leave obtained from the Court of Appeal.

Therefore, the State cannot maintain this appeal and he submits a

judgment of H/L Justice Ranjith Silva, in C.A. Appeal No. 210/2005

unreported decided on 26th of March 2010 where His Lordships have

decided if there is no leave obtained, the appellant cannot maintain

an appeal.

Learned Senior State Counsel Ms. Anoopa de Silva who is

appearing for the Attorney General maintaining the highest tradition of

Attorney General's Department, concedes that in this case there is a

mixed issue of fact and law is averred in the petition of appeal.

Therefore, the said section and the act is applicable to them. Further,

she submits that in Collet's case the Supreme Court has interpreted

what are the "facts". That matter is an appeal from the Court of Appeal

to the Supreme Court and its of civil in nature. Further Article 128 is

applicable in that case.

Considering all submissions before us we find that the appellant

has not obtain leave under Section 1 5 (a)(ii) of the Judicature Act.

Therefore, we uphold their preliminary objection and dismiss the appeal.
