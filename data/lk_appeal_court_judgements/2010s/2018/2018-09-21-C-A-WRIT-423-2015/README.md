Decided on: 19.09.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash, by way of

certiorari, the Quit Notice issued under section 3 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979, as amended,

and; to issue a writ of prohibition preventing the 1st-4th

respondents from ejecting the petitioner from the land described

in the schedule to the Quit Notice.

3

The Quit Notice has been issued on the basis that the said land

belongs to the State Plantation Corporation, whereas the

petitioner states that it belongs to the Land Reform Commission-

the 5th respondent to this application. It is on that premise,

learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the issuance of

Quit Notice is fundamentally flawed.

The sole document relied on by the petitioner to say that the

land belongs to the Land Reform Commission is the letter issued

by the Land Reform Commission marked P7.

However, that letter refers to a land known as Bagawantalawa

Estate, and not Kotiyagala Estate, which is the land relevant to

the Quit Notice. Therefore, that letter cannot be of any

assistance to the petitioner. Hence the application of the

petitioner is liable to be dismissed.

Even though it is not necessary, let me now consider the

position taken up by the Land Reform Commission in

supporting the application of the petitioner.

The Land Reform Commission in its purported statement of

objections states that an extent of 1518 and acres of

Kotiyagala Estate was vested in the Land Reform Commission

under the Land Reform Law, No.1 of 1972; and by the

Extraordinary Gazette No.150/12 dated 24.07.1981, out of that

land, an extent of 1081 acres 2 roods and 1 perch has been,

arbitrarily and illegally, vested (by the subject minister) in the

State Plantation Corporation; and the balance portion of 147

acres is still owned by the Land Reform Commission; and

therefore the State Plantation Corporation has no right to evict

the petitioner from the balance portion.

4

A close perusal of the said Gazette marked 1R1 reveals that,

what has been vested in the State Plantation Corporation is not

an extent of 1081 acres 2 roods and 1 perch, but an extent of

1754 acres 2 roods and 12 perches (that is, 1081 acres 2 roods

and 1 perch from Kotiyagala Estate, and 673 acres and 11

perches from Chapelton Estate, which is part of Kotiyagala

Estate). In addition, an extent of 543 acres 1 rood and 39

perches from Bogawantalawa Estate (the land referred to in P7)

has also been vested in the State Plantation Corporation. Then it

is clear that nothing is left with the Land Reform Commission in

Kotiyagala Estate, after vesting in the State Plantation

Corporation.

The alleged illegality of the said vesting order (1R1) in favour of

the State Plantation Corporation is not being challenged in these

proceedings.

There is no merit in this application.

In view of the above finding of fact, there is no necessity for this

Court to consider in detail, the grounds upon which Quit Notice

can be challenged in law, the point stressed by learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General at the argument.

Application is dismissed without costs.

The parties in the connected writ applications: 424/2015,

425/2015 and 426/2015 will abide by this Judgment.
