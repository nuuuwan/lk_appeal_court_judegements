The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Jaffna for the

murder of his wife Amirthalingam Suya punishable under section 296 of

the Penal Code. After trial he was convicted and sentenced to death on

06/03/2014. This appeal is against this said conviction and sentence.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the

circumstantial evidence placed before the High Court by the prosecution

was not adequate to convict the accused and that the Learned High Court

Judge failed to apply the principles governing the evaluation of evidence.

The appellant's counsel also stated that the Learned High Court Judge

erred when applying the principle relating to section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance and also applying the last seen theory and Ellenborough

principle.

The story of the prosecution is that the appellant and the deceased

were husband and wife and the deceased was 9 months pregnant at the

time of the incident. There had been a cyclone in the area and residents

of the area have taken refuge in a nearby church and temple. The

appellant has made a complaint to police to say the deceased his wife

2

/

has gone missing. The father and the brother of the deceased along with

the appellant and some others have gone in search of the deceased. Both

the brother and father have given evidence to say that the appellant

prevented them from going towards the place where the deceased's body

was later found.

The father of the deceased has given evidence to say that when

he asked about the deceased from the appellant he has said she was at

home whereas when he went there she was not there. Thereafter the

appellant had said that she had gone to her brother's house. It has also

transpired in evidence that the appellant had constant quarrels with the

deceased over her jewellery. The gold chain and bangle was recovered

after the appellant's statement was recorded by the police under section

27 of the Evidence Ordinance. The jewellery was identified as the

deceased's jewellery by the father and brother. The medical evidence

revealed that the deceased had died due to strangulation, and not due to

drowning. The body had been dumped in water after being strangled. The

appellant had remained silent after the prosecution case was closed.

The jewellery of the deceased was recovered by the police after

the appellant made a statement and showed the place they were hidden,

this has been done under section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

The argument of the appellant's counsel was that the finding that

the deceased was last seen with the appellant is a factual misdirection of

the learned High Court Judge. And also submitted that the last seen

theory can not be considered as an incriminating item of circumstantial

evidence as they were married. It was also stated that the prosecution

failed to prove there was no third party present, at the time of the incident.

Learned counsel cited the judgment in Don Sunny vs The AG

(1998) 2 SLR 1, R vs Clarke (1995) 98 A Crim R 226, R Akpan vs State

(2001) FW1 R (pt.56) 735 and argued that the Learned High Court Judge

has failed to apply the principles governing the circumstantial evidence

and has burdened the appellant to explain the disappearance of the

deceased.

When the prosecution has proved its case and a finger is pointed

at the accused appellant accusing him of the charge it is a requirement

of the accused to give the court an explanation. The appellant had chosen

to remain silent.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the appellant had

a burden to explain to court the whereabouts of his wife since she was

last seen with him. The respondent cited the judgment in Dissanayake

Appuhamilage Amarasiri Dissanayake vs The AG S.C. appeal 232/14

and stated that it is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that the

appellant refrains from explaining because the by doing so it would have

adversely operate to his interests.

In Dissanayake Appuhamilage Amarasiri vs The AG it was

stated thus;

"the appel/ant in his short dock statement had not offered any

explanation with regard to the strong and incriminating evidence

led against him. When a strong prima facie case has been made

out by the prosecution the appellant has, though he has not been

bound by law to offer any explanation, failed and omitted to

explain the strong circumstantial evidence let against him."

In the instant case the evidence placed before the High Court

clearly showed that there had been constant arguments between the

deceased and the appellant and that he wanted the deceased's jewellery.

The said jewellery was recovered after a statement was made by the

appellant and section 27 recovery was made by the police. Had he not

known about the deceased's whereabouts' how he did get hold of her

5

/. If /

jewellery? It had also transpired at the trial that he tried to mislead the

search party who went in search of the deceased. He had told two

different stories to the deceased's father when he inquired about the

deceased. This shows that he had tried to divert his attention from the

deceased.

On perusal of the learned High Court Judge's judgment and the

evidence placed before the High Court it is evident that the prosecution

has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has

caused the death of the deceased and the Learned High Court Judge had

correctly evaluated the evidence placed before the High Court.

For the afore stated reasons we are not inclined to set aside a well

considered judgment. We affirm the judgment dated 16/03/2014 and the

sentence of the High Court. We accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
