ORDER

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called

and referred to as the 1st Respondent) had filed a charge sheet against two

accused on an allegation that they were transporting timber without a valid

permit, an offence punishable under the provisions of the Forest Ordinance .

The said accused had pleaded guilty to the charges framed against them.

Learned Magistrate had then convicted and sentenced them.

Thereafter the learned Magistrate had taken steps to hold an inquiry to

decide the question whether the vehicle (which is the lorry bearing

registration No. 325 - 3976) should be confiscated or not.

At the end of the said inquiry the learned Magistrate by her order dated

2008-01-29, had decided to confiscate the said lorry on the basis that the

Claimant - Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes called and referred

4

to as the Petitioner) who is the registered owner of the lorry has failed to

satisfy Court that he had taken all possible steps to prevent this vehicle being

used for illegal activities.

The Petitioner being dissatisfied with the said order of the learned Magistrate

had filed an application in the Provincial High Court seeking to revise the said

order. The Provincial High Court Judge however has decided to refuse to

issue notices on the Respondents and proceeded to dismiss the said revision

application on the same basis. Petitioner has filed the instant application for

revision in this Court to challenge the said order of the Provincial High Court.

The sole argument put forward by the learned President's counsel for the

Petitioner is that the learned Magistrate had erroneously stated in his order

that the Petitioner had suppressed the fact that his son drove the vehicle at

the time of detection of this lorry transporting timber without a permit. It is

his submission that such a finding is not supported by the evidence of the

Petitioner.

Although this Court can observe that the learned Magistrate had stated so

in his order, he had also taken care to qualify the said statement immediately

thereafter. Even if this Court holds with the Petitioner on that point, this

Court is still required to consider whether the Petitioner has discharged the

5

burden cast by law on him as the registered owner. Such a step would be

necessary if this Court is to vary the learned Magistrate's conclusion.

It is to be noted at the outset, that only the evidence of the Petitioner was

adduced on behalf of the Petitioner before the learned Magistrate.

It would be convenient to set out here briefly the law pertaining to the

burden, which a registered owner is required to discharge at an inquiry of

this nature.

The burden of proving that the Petitioner did not have knowledge or that he

had taken all precautions is on the Petitioner. Therefore, the Petitioner

should prove this fact through evidence to the satisfaction of the Magistrate.

This Court observes that the evidence of the Petitioner does not contain at

least a cursory remark with regard to the fact that he did not have knowledge

of commission of this offence. He is also silent on the question whether he

had taken any steps as precautionary measures to prevent the relevant

vehicle being used to commit illegal activities.

Thus, it would be correct to say that the Petitioner had adduced no material

with regard to the facts he must prove before Court.

6

Furthermore, this Court had gone further to state in the case of K Mary

Matilda Silva V P H De Silva, Inspector of Police, Police Station, Habarana1,

which is a case under the Animals Act, that in this type of a situation,

giving mere instructions is not sufficient to discharge the burden cast on

the owner of a vehicle. This Court went on to hold in the said case that the

owner of the vehicle must not only prove that genuine instructions were in

fact given, but also took every endeavor to implement the instructions so

given. This Court in that case had held that the failure to prove the above

requirements would indicate that indeed no genuine instructions had been

given.

It would not be irrelevant to refer at this stage to section 3 of the evidence

ordinance, which has defined the word 'proved'. It is as follows.

'A fact is said to be proved when, after considering matters before it, the

Court either believes it to exist or considers its existence is so probable that

a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the case, to act upon the

supposition that it exists.'

1 CA (PHC) 86/97 Decided on 2010-07-08

7

Perusal of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Petitioner shows clearly

that a prudent man ought not to have believed that the Petitioner has taken

all precautions to prevent the relevant lorry being put to illegal use.

Further, the Petitioner has chosen not to lead the evidence of the driver of

the vehicle. Thus, the Petitioner has also failed to adduce any material to the

satisfaction of the learned Magistrate to establish that the relevant offence

was committed without his knowledge.

Moreover, one must be mindful that in the instant case the Provincial High

Court was called upon to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. According to

the caption of the revision application filed in the Provincial High Court, it is

under Article 154 P of the Constitution read with the provisions of the High

Courts of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 that the said

application has been made.

Section 5 of the High Courts of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 has made the provisions of written law applicable to appeals and

revision applications made to Court of Appeal, applicable to such cases filed

in the Provincial High Courts. Thus, chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is applicable to the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction by the Provincial High Courts as well.

8

Article 154 (3) (b) states that notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and

subject to any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province; .... ".

Further, this Court is mindful that this is a revision application. According to

section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, the

Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction, can call for and examine the

record of any case for satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any

order passed therein or as to the regularity of the proceedings of such

Court. Thus, three aspects, which a Court could consider in revisionary

proceedings, have been specified in that section. They are

i. legality of any order,

ii. propriety of any order and

iii. regularity of the proceedings of such Court.

This Court in the case of Attorney General Vs Ranasinghe and others2 had

referred to this criterion embodied in section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act in the following way;

2 1993 (2) Sri. L. R. 81.

9

" ..... This power can be exercised for any of the following purposes;

1) to satisfy this Court as to the legality of any sentence or order passes

by the High Court or Magistrate's Court,

2) to satisfy this Court as to the propriety of any sentence or order

passed by such Court,

3) to satisfy this Court as to the regularity of the proceeding of such

Court.

"

Having this in mind, it is the observation of this Court that the Petitioner in

the instant case has failed to prove any ground, which is at least

suggestive of any illegality or any impropriety of the order under challenge.

In the instant case there is no complain about the last aspect i.e. regularity

of the proceedings.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court has to conclude that there had been

no basis for the Provincial High Court to interfere with the conclusion of the

learned Magistrate as the Court can satisfy itself with the legality and

propriety of the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate.

..

10

Therefore, this Court holds that the learned Provincial High Court Judge is

correct when he decided to refuse to issue notices on the Respondents and

dismiss the application for revision filed by the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, this Court decides not to issue notices on the

Respondents. This Court proceeds to dismiss this application without costs.
