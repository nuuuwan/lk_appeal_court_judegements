The Petitioners have filed this application, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 13th - 15th Respondents

to grant an environmental protection clearance to the 9th Respondent to

operate a filling station in Galenbindunuwewa;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st - 8th Respondents to

grant approval to the 9th Respondent to operate a filling station in

Galenbindunuwewa.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner is a resident of Galenbindunuwewa. In addition to cultivating

a paddy land which he claims is owned by his brother-in- law, the Petitioner is

A

engaged in business and is the proprietor of Nimalsiri Motor Enterprises. The

2nd Petitioner is operating a filling station owned by the 1st Respondent Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation situated in the Galenbindunuwewa town, since 1994.

The family of the 2nd Petitioner had been operating the said filling station prior

to that for several years.

The Petitioners state that in May 2018, the 9th Respondent had commenced

filling a land situated in Galenbindunuwewa1 and had commenced construction

on the said land. The Petitioners had made inquiries and found that part of the

said land2 had been sold by its owner Priyantha Fernando to the 9th

Respondene. The Petitioners state that in July 2018, underground tanks had

been installed on the said land and the Petitioners had found out that the 1st

Respondent had granted approval to the 9th Respondent to commence a filling

station.

The Petitioners have two grievances with regard to the construction of the said

filling station on the said land. The Petitioners' first grievance is the violation of

a decision that the Petitioners claim the 1st Respondent had taken that new

filling stations will not be approved within a distance of 1km from an existing

station. This Court is of the view that any such decision would have been taken

by the 1st Respondent for commercial reasons and that the 1st Respondent has

the right to vary such commercial decisions from time to time depending on

the circumstances prevailing at such time. The 2nd Petitioner has not stated in

his petition that he adjusted his business affairs based on the said commercial

1 The said land is depicted as Lot No. 453 in Plan No. FVP1420, produced with the petition marked 'P1A,. The Tenement List annexed to the petition marked 'P1B' describes the property as a 'garden containing coconut trees and a permanent house.'

2 The total extent of Lot No. 453 is 2A OR 1P. The extent of land sold to the gth Respondent is 1R 22P and is depicted as Lot No.2 on Plan No. 1427 produced by the gth Respondent marked '9R1'.

decision of the 1st Respondent. This could not be the case in any event as the

said decision is said to have been taken in 2012 whereas the 2nd Petitioner has

been operating his filling station since 1994. This Court is of the view that the

said decision is not justiciable through the jurisdiction conferred on this Court

by Article 140 of the Constitution. For these reasons, this Court does not see

any merit in the Petitioners first complaint.

The second grievance of the Petitioners is that the said land is surrounded by

paddy lands, streams and water ways and the construction of the filling station

would cause environmental damage to the surrounding paddy lands and water

resources. The Respondents, whilst denying that there is environmental

damage caused by the construction of a filling station, state that the

Petitioners have not come to Court with clean hands and that this application

has been filed by the Petitioners for a collateral purpose. This Court would

consider this submission of the Respondents as a preliminary issue as it goes to

the root of this application and would determine if this Court should consider

the purported grievance of the Petitioners.

The 1st Petitioner claims he is affected by the construction of the filling station

as the land he is cultivating is situated in front of the land on which the filling

station is being constructed and the discharge of waste water and affluent by

the filling station would pollute the water ways from which water is obtained

for cultivation.

The 1st Petitioner however admits that he too had wanted to purchase part of

this land in 2015 for the identical purpose of starting a filling station and that

he had in fact paid an advance to the owner of the property. The 1st Petitioner

claims that the transaction did not go through as he was informed by the

authorities that approval cannot be granted as the said land is situated close to

a large paddy field. This Court observes that proof of such refusal has not been

submitted with the petition. Therefore, the fact that the authorities did not

grant approval for the 1st Petitioner to go ahead with the setting up of a filling

station on this land as the land was situated close to a large paddy field is a fact

that the Petitioners have failed to prove.

Be that as it may, the question that arises is how a land which was suitable for

the 1st Petitioner to commence a filling station in 2015, has become unsuitable

for the 9th Respondent to start a filling station in 2018? The same

considerations of polluting the same water ways would have applied

irrespective of who is constructing and operating the filling station.

It is admitted by all parties that the 2nd Petitioner is operating the only filling

station presently available at Galenbidunuwewa and that the closest filling

station is presently situated 18km away. The 2nd Petitioner, by a letter dated

21st February 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'pll' has complained to

the 1st Respondent that his business would be severely affected if approval is

granted for another filling station. Thus, it is clear to this Court that the filing of

this application by the 2nd Petitioner is to unfairly protect his business interests

and ensure that there is no competition as opposed to being concerned with

damage being caused to the environment.

This conduct of the Petitioners gives credence to the claim of the Respondents

that this action has been filed for a collateral purpose, namely to prevent

another filling station being established in close proximity to the filling station

operated by the 2nd Petitioner, and not because of any potential damage being

caused to the environment. In these circumstances, this Court is in agreement

with the objection taken by the Respondents that this action has been filed for

a collateral purpose and that the Petitioners have not come to Court with clean

hands.

The Respondents have submitted that there are several averments in the

petition which are clearly untrue or false. The first is the 1st Petitioner's claim

that the land cultivated by him belongs to his brother in law. This has been

rebutted by the 9th Respondent who claims that the owner of the said land,

Wasantha Jayalath is not the brother in law of the 1st Petitioner. This is

corroborated by the affidavit of Wasantha Jayalath, marked '9R6'. Thus, the 1st

Petitioner has uttered a falsehood to this Court, for which no explanation has

been offered. Furthermore, although the 1st Petitioner states that it is he who

is cultivating the said land, the 9th Respondent has submitted that it is not the

1st Petitioner who is cultivating the said land but the wife of the 1st Petitioner, a

fact which has not been denied by the 1st Petitioner. In any event, Wasantha

Jayalath has stated that 4 acres out of his 5 acre land is being cultivated by him

and that he has no objection to the construction of the filling station by the 9th

Respondent.

The Petitioners state that they made inquiries and became aware only in May

2018 that the 9th Respondent had submitted an application to establish a filling

station. This is clearly wrong when one considers that by letter dated 21st

February 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'Pll', the 2nd Petitioner

informed the 1st Respondent as follows:

o

't~ >ecsS ~ ~ ftC)@ &:> 9Dd 25 C) oi'rl coSo ~ceeD eDe> ~ ~ ~ ~(5)6) COes> Q)e> ~z;!) ffiem.'

This clearly establishes that the 2nd Petitioner was aware of the construction of

the filling station as far back as February 2018 but has chosen to state that

they became aware only in May 2018. Quite apart from attempting to mislead

Court on this matter, 'Pll' is proof that the Petitioners did not invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court for more than 6 months and are guilty of laches.

The next misrepresentation of facts by the Petitioners is their statement that

the application of the 1st Petitioner to operate a filling station was refused by

government officials on the basis that the said land is situated in close

proximity to a large paddy field and would have an adverse impact on the

environment. However, according to the 1st Respondent, the application

submitted by the 1st Petitioner4 to operate a filling station in 2016 had been

rejected on the basis that the 1st Petitioner did not have the financial capability

to run a filling station, a fact which is established by the documents submitted

to this Court by the 1st Respondent marked 'lRS' and 'lR6'.

Our Courts have consistently held that a party invoking the Writ jurisdiction of

this Court must come with clean hands and utmost good faith. The Supreme

Court in Liyanage & another v Ratnasiri, Divisional Secretary, Gampaha &

OthersS citing the case of Jayasinghe v National Institute of Fisheries and

Nautical Engineering and Others6 has held as follows:

4 A copy of the said application along with the annexures have been submitted to this Court by the 1st

Respondent marked 'IRS'.

"The conduct of the Petitioner in withholding these material facts from

Court shows a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner. When a

litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into a

contractual obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship

requires the Petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly.

This is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from Court.

In the case of Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Limited v. Wilfred Van Els and Two

Others7, the Court highlighted this contractual obligation which a party

enters into with the Court, requiring the need to disclose uberrima fides

and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to Court. Any party who

misleads Court, misrepresents facts to Court or utters falsehood in Court

will not be entitled to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established

proposition of law, since Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank

and open with the Court. This principle has been applied even in an

application that has been made to challenge a decision made without

jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go into the merits of the case in such

situations."

In Timberlake International (Pvt) ltd. Vs. The Conservator General of

Forests8, the Supreme Court, having held that the conduct of an applicant

seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is of great relevance because such

Writs, being prerogative remedies, are not issued as of right, and are

dependent on the discretion of court, stated as follows:

7 1997 (1) Sri lR 360.

B S.c. Appeal No: 06/2008 SC Minutes of 2nd March 2010.

lilt is trite law that any person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to show

uberrimae fides or (utmost) good faith, and disclose all material facts to

this Court to enable it to arrive at a correct adjudication on the issues

arising upon this application."

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the lack of good faith on

the part of the Petitioners, the filing of this application to achieve collateral

purposes and the aforementioned suppression and misrepresentation is

sufficient for this Court to reject this application of the Petitioners.

This Court would like to advert to one other matter. The Petitioners have

complained to this Court that there is a possibility of water ways, streams and

paddy fields being polluted and damage being caused to the environment by

the construction of the said filling station by the 9th Respondent. This Court

observes that obtaining the approval of the 13th Respondent Central

Environmental Authority is one of the criteria laid down by the 1st Respondent9

for the selection of new dealers. This Court further observes that at the

request of the 1ih Respondent Divisional SecretarylO, the 13th Respondent has

conducted a site inspection prior to the construction of the filling station and,

by its letter dated 6th April 2016 produced by the 9th Respondent marked

'9R9b', granted environmental clearance for the construction of the filling

station subject to the conditions set out therein. This demonstrates that due

consideration has been given to the provisions of the National Environment

Act at the time construction of the filling station commenced. Clause 18.1 of

'9R9b' states further as follows:

9 The criteria for selection has been produced with the Counter Affidavit, marked' A9'. 10 h f th th T e request 0 the 12 Respondent has been produced by the 9 Respondent, marked '9R9a'.

This clearly establishes that the 9th Respondent must obtain an Environmental

Protection License for the operation of the filling station from the 13th

Respondent. In these circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to

quash the environmental clearance granted by '9R9b'.

For the reasons set out in this Order, this Court does not see any legal basis to

issue notices on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed,

with costs fixed at Rs. 100,000 payable by the Petitioners to the 9th

Respondent.
