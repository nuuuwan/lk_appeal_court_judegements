JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent -

Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant),

in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

4

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Kalutara seeking an order to evict the Appellant

from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2011-

03-04 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of Western

Province holden in Kalutara seeking a revision of the order of the learned

Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2013 -06-06, holding that there is no basis

to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate. The

Provincial High Court on that basis had proceeded to dismiss the said

revision application.

It is that judgment that the Appellant is canvassing in this appeal before

this Court.

Upon consideration of the material adduced in this case this Court is unable

to see any basis to assail the orders of the lower Courts as the scope of the

inquiry to be conducted by the Magistrate is very limited one in the

proceedings of this nature.

It must also be noted that section 9 of the Act sets out the scope of the

inquiry to be held before the Magistrate in following terms;

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid . ... If

6

This is so particularly in view of the conclusion by this Court in the case of

Muhandiram vs. Chairman, No.11l, Janatha Estate Development Board1

which is to the following effect;

" ... Unless the respondent-petitioner had established before the learned

Magistrate that he was in occupation of the land stated in the schedule to

the application on a valid permit or other written authority of the State, he

cannot continue to occupy the said land and in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, NO.7 of 1979, the Magistrate has to make

an order directing the respondent and his dependents to be ejected from

the land . ... ff

In the case of L H M B B Herath, Chief Manager Welfare and Industrial

Relations, Sri Lanka Ports Authority V Morgan Engineering (Pvt) Ltd.2 the

Supreme Court had held that section 9 of the Act has placed limitations on

the scope of the inquiry which should be conducted by the Magistrate.

As the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act has been enacted for the

speedy recovery of state lands from unauthorized possession or

occupation, the Supreme Court went on to state in the above judgment as

follows;

1 1992 (1) SLR 110

2 SC Appeal 214/2012 decided on 2013-06-27.

.

" ... if the language of the enactment is clear and unambiguous, it would

not be legitimate for the Courts to add words by implication into the

language. It is a settled law of interpretation that the words are to be

interpreted as they appear in the provision, simple and grammatical

meaning is to be given to them, and nothing can be added or subtracted.

The Courts must construe the words as they find it and cannot go outside

the ambit of the section and speculate as to what the legislature intended.

An interpretation of section 9 which defeats the intent and purpose for

which it was enacted should be avoided .... "

In the instant case, it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced

before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

possession or occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by

section 9 of the Act.

Thus, the conclusion arrived at by the learned Provincial High Court Judge

that the learned Magistrate has issued the eviction order correctly is

affirmed by this Court as well.

, ,

8

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with

costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/= payable by the Appellant to the state.

Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/=.
