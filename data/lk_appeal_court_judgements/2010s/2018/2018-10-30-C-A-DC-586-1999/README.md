M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District

Judge of Gampaha in respect of a Partition Action bearing case

Number 36204/P. The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the 'Respondent') instituted this action seeking to partition

the land called "Kahatagahawatta" depicted in Plan Number 864

dated 14.06.1996 made by L. A. G. Perera, Licensed Surveyor

produced and marked as "X" and filed of record.

The Respondent in her Plaint dated 07.06.1993, sought an

interim injunction and an enjoining order against the 1 st to 6th

Defendants preventing them from constructing a building

besides partitioning of the corpus as pleaded.

Prior to the commencement of the trial both parties came to a

settlement and the 1 st to 6th Defendants agreed to stop the

constructions (vide page 49 in the Appeal briefJ.

At the trial, the Substituted Plaintiff gave evidence and stated

that the Original owner of the corpus was Chala Fernando who

transferred his title to Herath Singho. Herath Singho was

unmarried and his rights devolved on his mother Mencho Hamy

and later on her daughter Elisa Hamy.

Elisa Hamy gifted undivided 1/2 share to Kirinelis as per Deed

No. 48622 dated 06.11.1965 (marked as 1 ~ 1 at page 139) and

the balance 1/2 share to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 48690,

attested by P. P. Jayawardena, Notary Public dated 15.11.1965

marked as ~l 1 (page 134 o/the Appeal briefJ.

Page I 2

Kirinelis died intestate, accordingly the 1 st Defendant, the widow

entitled to 1/2 share and the 2nd to 6th Defendants entitled to the

balance 1/2 of Kirinelis's share of the corpus.

1 st to 6 th Defendants filed their answers on 23.07.1997 and

claimed entirely of the questioned land on Prescription.

The Defendants' position is that the Plaintiff is not entitled to

any rights in the land sought to be partitioned and as well as 1 st

to 6th Defendants have had possession of the corpus for over 10

years. Therefore, they had argued that there is sufficient

evidence to establish prescriptive title against the Plaintiff.

At the end of the trial, the Learned District Judge delivered his

judgment dated 07.07.1999 in favour of the Plaintiff. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment, the Defendant-Appellants

appealed to this Court seeking to set aside the judgment and

interlocutory decree.

It is settled law that according to the provisions of section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance Act, No 2 of 1889 the claimant must

prove the following elements:-

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to independent or adverse to the claimant

and

3. Then (10) years previous to the bringing of such action.

In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a

change in the nature of the possession and the party claiming

prescriptive right should show an ouster.

Page I 3

According to the evidence presented at the trial it is revealed that

the Respondent and the Defendants are blood relations and the

questioned corpus is an undivided land. And both parties

claimed that the right of the corpus through the same person

namely Elisa Hamy.

The Substituted Plaintiff produced a Deed No. 48690 dated

15.11.1965 attested by P. P. Jayawardena, Notary Public marked

as ~l 1 and claimed that his late mother (the Plaintiff) received

the balance 1/2 share of Elisa Hamy in the questioned land.

This fact was testified by the Substituted Plaintiff (Respondent)

as follows:-

In Corea vs. Appuhamy (1911) 15 NLR 65 the Privy Council

held that the possession of a co-owner was in law, the

posseSSIOn of the other co-owners and thus, not adverse to

them. In other words even if one co-owner's possession of the

common property or part thereof was of a character incompatible

with the title or the other co-owners, yet that co-owner possess

the common property on behalf of all co-owners. It was not

possible for him to put an end to the possession by any secret

intention in his mind, nothing short of ouster, or something

equivalent to ouster could bring about this result.

In Corea vs. Appuhamy, the Privy Council decision laid down for

the first time in clear and authorities terms the following

principles:

1. The possession of one-owner, was in law, the possession of

others;

2. Every co-owner must be presumed to be possessing in that

capacity;

3. It was not possible for such a co-owner to put an end to

that title and to initiate a prescriptive title by any secret

intention in his own mind; and

4. That nothing short of an ouster could bring about that

result.

In Wickramaratne and Another vs. Alpenis Perera (1986) (1)

SLR 190, G. P. S De Silva, J. held that,

((In a partition action for a lot of land claimed by the

plaintiff to be a divided portion of a larger land, he must

adduce proof that the co-owner who originated the

division and such co-owner's successors had prescribed to

Page I 5

that divided portion by adverse possession for at least ten

years from the date of ouster or something equivalent to

ouster. Where such co-owner had himself executed deeds

for undivided shares of the larger land after the year of

the alleged dividing off it will militate against the plea of

prescription. Possession of divided portions by different

co-owners IS in no way inconsistent with common

possession. "

"A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of the

co-owners every co-owner is presumed to be in possession

in his capacity as co-owner. A co-owner cannot put an end

to his possession as co-owner by a secret intention in his

mind Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to

ouster could bring about that result."

In Tillekeratne vs. Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12, Betram, C. J.

referring to the real effect of the decision in Corea vs.

Appuhamy upon the interpretation of the word "adverse" with

reference to cease of co-ownership stated that the word must be

interpreted in the context of three principle of Law:-

1. Every co-owner having a right to possess and enjoy the whole property and every part of it, the possession of one co-owner in that capacity is in law the possession of all.

2. Where the circumstances are such that a man's possession may be referable either to an unlawful act or to a lawful title, he is presumed to possess by virtue of the laWful title.

3. A person who has entered into possession of land in one capacity is presumed to continue to possess it in the same capacity. (Page at 1 9)

Page I 6

In the present matter the Defendants clearly knew from the

beginning that the corpus in dispute is a co-owned property.

Though the Defendants have sought title under prescription for

long term possession they have not provided any cogent evidence

to prove the same and for adverse possession.

Though the Defendants have possessed the corpus knowing it is

a co-owned property here is no such evidence presented at the

trial by the 2nd Defendant to support their claim.

The only evidence was once when the Plaintiff went to the

questioned land, the father of the 2nd Defendant told her as,

" ... ~o~ q:> q:>) q)~))25) 2)):>25)"2)):> ~D):>, C~C) qSe'3C-'~

Z)IWI. ~CC-'2rl C-'2rlZ) ~C-':>." (Vide page 71 in the Appeal brief).

To prove a prescription against a co-owner there must be cogent

evidence if he is a family member for adverse possession and for

prescriptive title against to other co-owner.

It is noted that the 1 8t to 6th Defendants mere possession for a

long period does not quality them to claim absolute ownership

and they had failed to prove an over act of ouster.

For the forgoing reasons, I see no reasons to interfere with the

judgment of the learned District Judge; and dismiss the appeal

with Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
