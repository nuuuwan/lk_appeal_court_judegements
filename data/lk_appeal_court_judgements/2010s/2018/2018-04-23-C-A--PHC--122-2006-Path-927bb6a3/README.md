JUDGMENT

PPadman Surasena J

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent -

Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant),

in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the 1st

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Rathnapura seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 1998-

08-13 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

4

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Rathnapura seeking a revision of the

o~der of the learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the concl usion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2006 -05-11, holding that there is no basis

to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate. The

Provincial High Court had therefore proceeded to dismiss the said revision

application.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Although the Appellant had been represented before this Court on the

initial stages when this case had come up in this Court, he had thereafter

been absent and unrepresented in this Court on the subsequent stages. He

has also failed to respond to the notices this Court had sent to him.

Nevertheless, this Court has proceeded to consider the merits of his

appeal.

5

It must also be noted that section 9 of the Act sets out the scope of the

inquiry to be held before the Magistrate in following terms; \

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid .... "

This Court in the case of Muhandiram vs. Chairman, No.llL Janatha

Estate Development Board! has re-iterated this position in following terms;

" ... Unless the respondent-petitioner had established before the learned

Magistrate that he was in occupation of the land stated in the schedule to

the application on a valid permit or other writt.en authority of the State, he

cannot continue to occupy the said land and in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, No.7 of 1979, the Magistrate has to make

an order directing the respondent and his dependents to be ejected from

the land .... "

6

In the instant case, it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced

before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

possession or occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by

section 9 of the Act.

Thus, the appellant has to be necessarily evicted from this land.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiSS this appeal with

costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
