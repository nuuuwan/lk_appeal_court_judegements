Judgment

S. Thurairaja, PC. J

Honourable Attorney General preferred an indictment under Section 296 of the Penal

Code against Rathnayake Widanalage Nimal Rathnayake (2nd Accused-Appellant,

hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) and Hapuwita Badahelayalage

Jepin Nona (the 1st Accused) fer committing the Murder of Withanage

Chandrarathna. The 1st accused had passed away in 2006 before the commencement

of the trial and the trial proceeded against the 2nd Appellant and he was found guilty

after the trial and convicted and sentenced to death. Being aggrieved with the said

conviction the Appellant has appealed to the Court of Appeal and submitted four

sets of grounds of appeal. Counsel for the Appellant at the stage of argument

content the following grounds of appeal.

I. Body was not properly identified according to the law.

II. Item used to death was not identified.

III. Credibility of the witnesses.

IV. Witness No.2 has given evidence before Magistrate Court however he has not

called before High Court to give evidence.

V. Evidence given by the Doctor and evidence of 1st Accused are contradicted.

VI. Learned Trial Judge has misdirected herself.

The Prosecution led the evidence of, Withanage Chaminda Sampath Withana (son of

the deceased), Rajapaksege Mangalika Nayanakanthi Rajapakse (a neighbour of the

deceased), Chief Inspector of Police Herath Mudiyanselage Somapala, Police

Constable Godawalage Sumanaweera and Judicial Medical Officer L.B.M. Alwis.

It will be appropriate to mention the facts of the case.

As per the Prosecution witnesses on 31 st of January 1992, the deceased, his wife (the

1st Accused), son and three daughters were sleeps in their house which had two

rooms. The deceased, his wife and one of their daughters were in one room and son

CA 13/2012 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 6

and Chamila Kumari (a daughter) and the other sister of them were in the other

room. Around 12 mid-night Chaminda, the son of the deceased (1st Prosecution

Witness- hereinafter sometimes referred to as PW1) and Chamila Kumari (a daughter

of the deceased) while they were sleeping, they heard a loud cry which somebody

was shouting "g;~ q@@@j'.

When they heard that shouting, immediately they went to the door-step of their

father's room of that house and he saw the person called "Ranji Mama" (2nd Accused-

Appellant) hitting the deceased with an axe. However Chamila Kumari stated that,

she saw Ranji Mama hold an axe with his hand, with the light of a kerosene lamp.

Then Chaminda tried to enter the room, Cit which point the 2nd Accused walked out

the rom. Chamila Kumari stated to the Police that their mother (the 1st Accused) told

them, "Q@@) tS5CJeJ) ~eD eJe:)) J!3c;:)@). tfi)~Jaf eJ(5) @(j))(;J)eJ) tS5CJeJ)." (don't shout and

don't tell anyone if (you) do so not I will take poison).

Immediately, after the incident, all children of the deceased were sent to their

grandfather's house, which was situated 50 yards away from their house, and they

stated that they slept there and got up at about 6 a.m. Thereafter in the' morning

they were sent them to their relative's house which was situated in Eheliyagoda

where they heard that their father had passed away.

Bulathkohupitiya Police, received an information about missing of a person on or

about 15th of February 1992. Then the investigation was commenced. During the

investigation Police came to know and parts of the body of the deceased were

recovered near a cave which was situated a kilometre away from the deceased's

house. PW1 gave evidence and identified his futhers' partially burnt body and pieces

of a bed sheet which was used at his house.

Considering the 1st ground of appeal is that the identification of the body of the

deceased was not properly done according to the law.

CA 13/2012 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 6

The Defence contents that the evidence gi~en by the PW1 in relating to the

identification of the body is insufficient, as the said witness had only identified the

body by the bed sheet in which the said body was wrapped and burned in. PW1 was

able to identify the bed sheet with the colours and pattern which was used by his

parents, hair of the head of deceased and parts of the legs (in page 42 and 43). In

relation to whether the identification of the deceased by way of his hair, the JMO

stated and confirmed that such identification could be made by a person who is

closely related with the deceased and who is familiar with any characteristics or

features of the deceased's physical appearance. As Justice Collin Thome stated in the

case of Jagathsena v. Bandaranayake [1984] 2 Sri L.R. 397-

"Deportment and demeanour as the all important factor when it relates to the

-arriving of findings in regard to credibility even in a case where there were

contradictions inter se in the evidence of the prosecution witness"

After carefully considering all facts, we are of the view that there is no merit in the 1 st

and 5th grounds of appeal.

The 2nd and 3rd grounds of appeal are that weapon used to commit death was not

identified and the credibility of the witnesses.

PW1 stated that the murder weapon used in this case was an axe (@o>6e. According

to the evidence given by the PW1, he did not refer about any weapon at any time as

anything other than an axe. This was evidenced and corroborated with the evidence

given by the Chamila Kumari before the Learned Judge of the Magistrate Court in

Case No.242/92 N.S.

Section 33 of the evidence Ordinance states that,

"Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person

, authorized by law to take it, is relevant, for the purpose of proving, in a

subsequent judicial proceeding or in a later stage of the same judicial

proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or

CA 13/2012 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 6

cannot be found, or is incapabLe of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by

the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of

deLay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the court considers

unreasonabLe:

Provided-

(a) That the proceeding was between the same parties or their

representatives in interest;

(b) That the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and

opportunity to cross-examine;

(c) That the question in issue were substantially the same in the first

as in the second proceeding.

Further both the weapon and the body of the deceased were recovered under

Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance and were identified by the PW1, Chief

Inspector of Police Herath Mudiyanselage Somapala and Chamila Kumari before the

Learned Judge of the Magistrate Court in the said Case No.242/92 N.S. Therefore,

this ground of appeal also fails on its own merits. Therefore, the 2nd and 3rd grounds

of appeal also fail on its own merits.

The 4th ground of appeal is that the witness No.2 has given evidence before

Magistrate Court was not called before High Court to give evidence. In Stephen and

three others v. Republic of Queen [66 NLR 264] held that,

"In a triaL upon an indictment, the deposition made by a witness at the

non-summary inquiry is not admissibLe in evidence after his death unLess

the originaL record of the non-summary proceedings is duly produced in

evidence together with a certified copy of the deposition. II

This case was followed by H.N.J. Perera J in Rupersinghe Arachchige Upali

Rupersinghe v. The Attorney General ICA 204/2012J.

CA 13/2012 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 6

"

Considering the facts of this case, the evidence was led at the non-summary inquiry

and submitted to the High Court under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Therefore, the evidence given by Chamila Kumari before the Learned Judge of the

Magistrate Court in the said Case No.242/92 N.S. is admissible under Section 33 of

the evidence Ordinance.

The 6th ground of appeal urged by the Appellant is that Learned Trial Judge has

misdirected herself. We carefully considered the judgment and we find that the

Learned Trial Judge had carefully analysed the evidence before her and critically

analysed the acceptability of the same. Thereupon she had come to her own

conclusion. Considering the given circum.stances we do not find there is any merit in

this ground of appeal.

We carefully considered the grounds of appeal in the light of the evidence available

before the trial court and the judgment and conclude that all grounds of appeal fails

on its own merits.

Therefore, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.

Appeal dismissed.
