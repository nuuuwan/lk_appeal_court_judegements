JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of Central

Province holden in Kandy praying for a writ of certiorari to quash a quit

4

notice issued by the 2nd Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 2nd Appellant) who is the Chairman of the National

Livestock Development Board, under section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge, after the hearing by his order dated

2014-09-24, had issued a writ of certiorari quashing the said quit notice.

Although a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court had been raised on behalf of the Appellants, perusal of the judgment

shows that learned Judge of the Provincial High Court had held in his

judgment that the Provincial High Court has jurisdiction to issue the writs

prayed for by the Respondent.

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned State Counsel

brought to the notice of this Court that this position of law has now been

decided by the Supreme Court in the case of The Superintendent, Stafford

Estate and two others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu 1,

The Supreme Court in that judgment had clearly held that the jurisdiction

conferred on the Provincial High Courts under Article 154 P 4(b) does not

12013 (1) Sri. L. R. 25.

5

extend to matters in respect of powers relating to recovery/dispossession

encroachment or alienation of state lands since they are not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) in the 9th Schedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

The subject matter under challenge in that case as well as in the instant

case is whether the Provincial High Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of

certiorari to quash a quit notice issued under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act.

This question of law has now been settled by the Supreme Court in the

case cited above.

Therefore the Provincial High Court does not possess jurisdiction to issue

under Article 154 P 4(b), writs of this nature in respect of matters relating

to alienation of state lands since such a subject is not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) in the 9th Schedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Thus, the

Provincial High Court in the instant case has no jurisdiction to issue the writ

it had issued. The Provincial High Court should have upheld the preliminary

6

objection raised against its exercise of writ jurisdiction in respect of this

case.

In these circumstances this Court decides to set aside the judgment of the

Provincial High Court dated 2014-09-24 and direct that the application

made by the Respondent to the Provincial High Court be refused and

dismissed.

Respondent is directed to pay a state cost of Rs. 40,000/=

Appeal is allowed.
