Counsel: Shantha Jayawardhana with Chamara Nanayakkarawasam for

the Petitioners

Nayomi Kahawita SSC for the Respondents

Argued on: 2018-01-29

Decided on: 2018-05-09

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioners are unemployed graduates who claim a legitimate

expectation that the examination to fill 500 vacancies for teachers, existing

in Sinhala medium schools in Uva province, would be filled as has been

advertised in the advertisement dated 2017-01-27. A copy of the said

1 newspaper advertisement has been produced marked P 1. The said

advertisement P 1 has stated that the method of recruitment is the school-

based method as provided for in the service minutes of the Sri Lanka

Teachers Service. The said service minutes published in the Gazette

Extraordinary of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka bearing No.

1885/38 dated 2014-10-23 has been produced marked P 2 (b).

10

The said Gazette has specificified a method of recruitment and has

particularly specified the method of Examination for the selection of

candidates for appointment.

The said Gazette has categorically stated that the conducting authority of

the written examination is the Commissioner General of examinations.

It is the position of the Petitioners that this is a public examination within

the meaning of Public Examinations Ordinance.

The respondents do not dispute the fact that this examination had not been

conducted as per the method set out in the said Gazette.

Learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the Respondents relied on the

t

document produced marked R 5 to argue that the Governor of Uva Province

had amended the said Gazette. It is her argument that the impugned exam

was conducted as per the said amended service minutes. When inquired by

this Court as to when that amendment was effected to the said Gazette, the

learned Senior State Counsel was unable to provide a specific answer to

Court in that regard.

11

The document, the Senior State Counsel relied upon, when taken without

the hand written part (the purported amendment, which has been made by

some handwriting entered at the end of the Gazette without any date), is

the same Gazette that the Petitioners rely on.

Further, this Court observes that the amendments referred to in the

newspaper advertisement calling for applications (P 1) are amendments,

which would be made to the said service minutes published in the said

Gazette.

The said Gazette has been issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education on the orders of the Public Service Commission. Thus, it is the

View of this Court that it is not open for the Governor to amend the said

Gazette. Thus, this Court is not inclined to accept the impugned hand written

insertion as an amendment that has been promulgated to the relevant

Gazette.

For the foregoing reasons, it is difficult for this Court to resist the thought

that the purported amendment is a part, somebody has inserted by

handwriting after the authorities had realized that the impugned

12

examinations had not been conducted as per the method set out in the said

newspaper advertisement (P 1).

Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that the Petitioners are entitled to

succeed.

In these circumstances, this Court issues;

1. a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st to 9th Respondents and/or any

one or more of them from making recruitments to the Teachers'

Service in Uva Province based on the said examination held on

09.04.2017 pursuant to the advertisement marked P I,

1

2. a Writ of Mandamus directing the 10th Respondent to organize and

conduct a written examination afresh in accordance with the Service

Minute of the Sri Lanka Teachers' Service marked P 2 {al and P {2l

!Ill for the recruitments contemplated by P 1;

3. a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 9th Respondents to take

necessary steps for the conduct of a written examination afresh by the

10th Respondent, in accordance with the Service Minute of the Sri

13

Lanka Teachers' Service marked P 2 (a) and P 2 (b) for recruitments

contemplated by P 1;

4. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the results of the written examination held

on 09.04.2017 pursuant to the advertisement marked P 1;

Application is allowed.
