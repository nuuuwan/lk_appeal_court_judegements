M.e. Jayaratne: with M.D.]. Bandara for the lA Defendant--Appellant

Ms Sudharshani',Coorey with N. Nayanakanthi for the Plaintiff, Respondent

22.06.2018

The pt, 2nd 3rd and 4th Plaintiff.-Respondents (hereinaft~r sometimes referred to as "the

r Plaintiffs") instituted this action against the originai five Defendants on 13.11.1985,

seeking inter alia that they be declared entitled to a pa~dy field called UAmbagahamula

Asswedduna" alias "Ambagahamula Kumbura" which \vas in an extent of about two pelas

paddy sowing area and morefully described in the schedule to the plaint and that the

Defendants be evicted and all those holding under them.

3

The Plaintiffs had also prayed for an interim injunction preventing the Defendants from

interfering with their possession and this relief had been granted against the Defendants

by an order dated 14.11.1985.

The pt Defendant--Appellant (hereinafter sometime referred to as "the pt Defendant")

filed her answer on 27.11.1986 and it was thereafter amended on 25.11.1991 and in the said

amended answer, the pt Defendant--Appellant specifically admitted that the Plaintiffs

.. were the lawful owners of. the four paddy fields in question. She further averred that her

late father l.M. Gunasekera, who was the husband of the 5th Defendant was the "Ande

Cultivator" of the four paddy fields in question until June 1985, during which month,

l.M. Gunasekera passed away--see paragraphs 3 and 9 ~f the said amended answer. The

Plaintiffs unlawfully entered the paddy fields in question, while the Defendants were

preparing the paddy fields for the next season and dest~oyed the paddy that had already

been cultivated by the Defendants. The damage to t~~ corpus has been assessed at Rs.

\

~o,ooo/--. It was asserted in the said answer that the pt Defendant--Appellant was the

daughter of the said l.M.Gunasekera and the 5th Defenqant who had passed away during

the pendency of this action.

In the circumstances, the pt Defendant prayed inter alit;l that she be declared the lawful

"An de Cultivator" of the paddy fields in question, bhe plaintiffs be ejected and the

possession of the paddy field be handed over. During the season of 1980/1986 damages

~n sum of Rs. 10,000/-- were also claimed as compensatipn, in addition to a further claim

of Rs. 10,000/-- per season to be recovered from the I;,'laintiffs till the possession was

restored.

When the adjourned trial commenced on 24.06.1992 ~o admissions were recorded and

issues were raised i.e Issues Nos. 1--5 by the Plaintiffs and Issues No. 6--4 on behaU of the

pt Defendant--Appellant. TJpon a perusal of the issues i~ would appear that the principal

issue in this action was \'!hether l.M. Gunasekera was or was not the tenant cultivator

of the paddy field in question.

PLAINTIFF's CASE

The Plaintiffs summoned an officer from the Department of Agrarian services who

marked and produced a document Pl3 dated 13.11.1985, This was a letter that had been

addressed to Thilakawathie ---another daughter of L.r;1. Gunasekera--- by the Agrarian

Services Commissioner to the effect that the "Ande Cultivator" of ~~Ambagahamula

J(umbura" which was in e)~tent of 1 acre and 32 perches~ ~as L.M. Gunasekera and it was

only after an inquiry that it could be decided whether Thilakawathie was or was not the

next "Ande Cultivator" qf the said "Ambagahamula Kum~ura". 1-he letter further notified

-rhilakwathie that until then she could not be considered the lawful tenant cultivator.

This document "P3" dated 13.11.1985 and issued by' the Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Services, Kuruncgala just 5 months after the death of L.M. Gunasekera described

the said L.M. Gunaseker~ as the registered "tenant cultivator" of Ambagahamula I(umbura

in extent of 1 acres and 32 perches. It has to be noted that P3 \vhich was marked by the

Plaintiffs themselves established quite clearly that LJ,1:. Gunasekeara the father of the

pt Defendant---Appellant ~'as indeed the tenant cultivator of the land called Ambagahamula

Kumbura. Thus the tenancy of L.M.Gunasekera had beehestablished by the doculuentary

evidence which was on the own showing of the Plaintiffs. Apart from the docull1entary

evidence of the Plaintiffs, 'the 4th Plaintiff himself testiHed that L.M. Gunasekera worked

in the disputed paddy ie~Jd namely "Ambagahamula F(t~mbura" alias by force. The 4th

Plaintiff produced a Deed of Gift bearing No. 141~33 that had been exec~ted on

03.08.1968.

It was in this deed of gift that the two lands called "Ambagahamula Kumbura" and

"AmbagahawulaAsscduwa" h.re described as two distinct lands.

Although the two lands cl~~e described separately, the 4th Plaintiff testified that both are , One and the same land. He also testified that L.M. Guri~skerd father of the pt Defendant---

Appellant cultivated this composite land, albeit by forc.;~. Even the schedule to th~ plaint

describes the land as Ambagahamula Asseduma I<umbura alias Ambahagahamula

5

'1 Kumbura. It is only in the Deed of Gift of 1968 th'ilt the two lands are described

separately. But the evidence of the 4lh Plaintiff and th~ schedule of the plaint describe

them as one and the same land. This leads one to the j.rresistible conclusion that L. M. , Gunasekera the deceaseq father of the 1st Defendant--Appellant had been cultivating on

the ground one composite land. In other words although the deed of gift described two

distinct lands, on the ground it had been cultivated as,one land. Otherwise why: should

the schedule to the plaint refer to one and the same land? Why should the 4th Plaintiff

~estify that "Ambagaham~la Kumbura" and Ambahagahamula Kumbura are one and the

same land?

No doubt the Plaintiff produced a document marked .as P4, which was an order of an

inquiry officer called Dissanayake of the Office of the Agrarian Services, Kurunegala. Upon

a complaint made by a daughter of L.M. Gunasekera namely Thilakawathie, this inquiry

had been initiated and th~ Plaintiffs were cited as the Respondents at that inquiry.

Ihilakawathie produced documents V2 to V6 to establish her tenancy rights but at the

conclusion of the inquiry the Inquiry Officer concluded that all these documents point . to a different land. But th~re is nothing to suggest that the inquiry officer made a visit to

the corpus to satisfy himself as to whether they constituted one land or two lands.

On a perusal of this evidence that had been led, I take the view that there was sufficient

evidence before the learn~d District Judge that the pt Sefendant was a tenant cultivator

:of this land. Even the prima facie evidence led in thecase remains unrebutted. In the

circumstances I take the view the appeal of the appellant must be allo\ved and I set aside

~he judgment and allow the appeal.

Evidentiary value of the documentary evidence V2.

V2 an entry in the agricuiturallands register has also been produced at the trial. Section

45(3) of the Agrarian Services Act provides that any entry in the register of agritultural

Jands shall be admissible in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated

therein.

Prima Facie Evidence '

In civil cases, where the lovver standard of proof on a balance of probabilities prevails, a

party may satisfy his burden by a prima facie case, if the other party fails to disprove it ---see

the English Court of Appeal decision of Abrath v. North Eastern Railway CoJ Our

Courts have followed the' above principle in a number 'Of cases. F.N.D. j ayasuriya j sets

out in detail the long line of precedents that have in~erpreted the words, "prima facie

evidence."---see Wicremasuriya v. Dedoleena and Others (substituted}.2 I would set

down the cases which F. I~.D. j ayasuriya j has cited in his illuminating judgment.

a) Drieberg,j's dictum in Velupillai v. Sidembranli

"Prima facie proof in effect means nothing more than sufficient --- proof --- proof which should be

accepted if there is nothing established to the contrary; but it must be what the law recognizes as

proof, that is to say, it must be something which a pnldent man in the circumstances of the

particular case ought to act upon --- S.3, Evidence Ordinance II

b) Neville Samarakoon C.J in UndugodaJinawansa Thero v. Yatavvara Pi)7aratne

Thera S.C. Appln. 46.18), S.C.M. 5.4.82

lilt is only a starting point and by no means an end to the nzatter. Its evidentiary value can be lost

by contrary evidencelrl rebuttaL.If after contrary evidence has been led the scales are evenly

balanced or tilted in favour of the opposing evidence that which initially stood as prima facie

evidence is rebutted ana is no longer of any value. Evidel.?ce in rebuttal may be either oral . i ~ or documentary or both .... The Register is not the only evidence" . .

Samarakoon C.J is quite Hlustrative. Once prima facie evidence is produced by o~e party,

I , '. the onus is on the other to rebut it by contrary evidence.,!he opposing evidence can erase

1 (1883) 11 Q.B.D 440 -this decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in (1886) 11 App. Cases 247.

the effect of the prima facie evidence evenly or it is so cogent that the case could tilt in

favour of the party who tenders the opposing and contrary evidence. This evidence need

!, not necessarily take the form of oral testimony. It could be documentary evidence alone.

In my view both prima facie evidence and contrary evidence in rebuttal can be oral or

documentary or both. Wftat matters in the end is how cogent the evidence is in order to

establish the fact in issue in the case. The list of authorities on prima facie evidence is

exhaustive.

c) S.B. Goonewardenc] in Herath v. Peter' -- another case which expressed similar

II views in regard to the construction of the words "prima facie evidence" in relation to

Agricultural Lands"Register entries.

d) Parinda Ranasinghe] (as he then was) in Dolawatte v. Gamage.s -- as stated before

" in this judgment, Justice S.B. Goonewardene J follo\ved in Herath v. Peter the '. views expressed by Parinda Ranasinghe J (as he then was) in Dolavr,atte v.

Gamage."

'F.N.D. Jayasuriya ] in his judgment in Wicremasur!ya v. Dedoleena and Others

(substitutedJi also cites comparative jurisprudence. .

f) Rex v Jacobson a~d LevY (Stratford J.A)

~n fact the dictum of Str.atford ] .A. in the South Afric~n case of Rex v. .Jacobson and

Levy on prima facie proofis worth recapitulation--

"Prima facie" evidence in its more usual sense, is used to mean prima facie proof of an issue the

burden of proving which is upon the party giving that evidence. In the absence of further evidence

, , from the other side, the prima facie proof becomes cOrldusive proof and the party giving it

,.

discharges his onus.

Additionally let me also cite A. T. Denning (Lord Denning) on Presumptions and

Burdens in 61 Law Quarterly Review 379 (1945), ,Presumptions, standards and

burdens-managing the cost of error 13 Law, Probability & Risk (2014) 13 at 221..-242

and Evidential Presumptions (2002) New Law Journal 152 at 217..-218.

, 1 , The Agricultural Lands R.egister entry VI, being an entry for the duration of the years

between 1980 and 1985 shows L.M. Gunasekera to be the tenant cultivator of the paddy

land known as Ambagaht} Kumbura.

The prima facie evidence 'thus led remains uncontradic:ted. There were no objections

raised to the admission of the document when it was ruarked..-see page 135 of the appeal

brief. If the entry in the Agricultural Lands Register is false, it must have been established

to be so by contrary evidence. The Agricultural Lands Register (ALR or PLR as it was

known before) describes the land as Ambagaha Kumbura though. The rejection of V2 by

the learned District Judge is thus erroneous for the reapons set out above as the burden

of rebutting prima facie evidence on the Plaintiff and this has not been borne in rnind by

~he learned District Judge. If V2 does not give the metes and bounds the provision of that

information cannot be cast upon the Defendants.

, It has to be noted that w.hen the tenancy was created., 'the owner did not subject it to a

survey plan and there is no evidence of identification that Ambagahamulla Assedduma,

and Ambagaha Kumbura are two distinct lands. The fact that physically they constitute

one land has not been takc.u away or whittled down by positive evidence. In thi.s regard

I do not wish to attach 111uch weight to the inquiry notes produced at the trial for the

reason that there was no mention of a visit made by thE. officer to the corpus .

There were other documf~nts that were marked namelyV3, V4, VS and V6. Two of them

I . . were receipts issued by the Cultivation Committee and the Others were receipts for

acreage taxes. These documents had been issued in favour of L.M.Gonasekera and it is

apparent that these documents too were not objected to when they were marked in

evidence.

;'

On a perusal of this evidence that had been led, I take the view that there was sufficient

evidence before the learned District Judge that L. M. Gunasekera was the tenant

cultivator but the learn~d District Judge misdirected himself on the fact and law.

Accordingly I proceed to allow the appeal and set aside'the judgment dated 2S.0~.l999.
