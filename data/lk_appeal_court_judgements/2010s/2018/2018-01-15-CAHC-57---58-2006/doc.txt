II. The trial Judge failed to consider the evidence which was in favour of

appellants

III. The trial Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence given by the 1 st accused

IV. Prosecution failed to call the EQD.

It will be appropriate to consider the facts of the case in brief.

The 1 st accused appellant is an Attorney at Law and Public Notary. The Second Accused

is a brother of the Complainant. 3rd Accused is the son of the 2nd accused. pt accused

and the 3rd accused sometimes will be referred to as the 1st appellant and 2nd appellant

respectively.

As per the evidence the complainant is the youngest child in a family of 7 children,

consists of 2 boys and 5 girls. She was unmarried and living in Colombo. She was gifted

with a property by her parents, which had a house in 60 perches of land. She has a

sister called Salmiya, she brought couple of proposals to complainant Fathima. The 2nd

accused being an elder brother rejected all and showed no interest in giving her

married.

On 19/02/1999 the second accused had come with a person called Rafeek and told

Salmiya that a marriage been organised to the complainant Fathima and asked her to

bring Fathima with her deed documents and also said that the other party had come

there. When Salmiya and the complainant went there, the second accused forcibly took

the deed and chased Salmiya away and locked down Fathima in a room. Salmiya

promptly lodged a complaint at the Police station, there all parties were summoned

and the Police reached a settlement by keeping the complainant at the house of the

CA 57-58/2006 JUDGMENT Page 4 ofB

2nd accused at Mutuwal, Colombo. Thereafter she was kept in the house of the 2nd

accused incommunicado.

On 01/03/1999, the complainant was taken by the second and third accused to the

house of the 1st Accused at Beruwala. There she was asked to sign 6 blank forms, when

she asked why and what are those, she was told thatfor her to stay at Kimbula-ela,

Colombo, she had to register herself with the police for that purpose she had to sign

those documents. She was told that the 3rd accused will also sign documents and he

too signed some documents. Being convinced with the explanation Fathima signed

those unfilled documents. Thereafter she was taken to the house of 2nd accused at

Colombo.

On the 16th March 1999, the 2nd accused had informed the complainant that her

property is now written in his name. On the following day i.e. 17th she managed to call

her sister Salmiya and told her the situation. The second accused then gave her Rs.

100/-, and her National Identity card and chased her away. Complainant then called

her sister and cried and told that she wants to commit suicide. Salmiya consoled her

sister Fathima and told her that she will send the father to bring her to back. Thereafter

they lodged a complaint at the Police Station of Aluthgama. It was referred to the SCIB

of Kalutara, who conducted the investigations.

The trial held before the High Court of Kalutara and it was heavily contested by the

accused persons. The Prosecution case in brief is that the 2nd and 3rd accused persons

prepared fraudulent deeds and transferred the property of the complainant Fathima.

The 1st Accused being a Notary Public collided with the 2nd and 3rd accused persons

and made the transactions. The defence version is that the complainant voluntarily and

wilfully placed her signature and transferred the property to 2nd and 3rd Accused

persons. Therefore, no offence committed.

State called six witnesses to prove the case for the prosecution. Three of them were

lay witnesses and the balance were officials. When the defence was called, pt accused

gave evidence under oath and the 3rd accused made a dock statement.

The Complainant Mohamed Saly Siththi Fathima gave evidence and narrated the facts

stated above. There are no material contradictions. or omissions marked by the

defence.

The next witness was Mohamed Saly Siththi Salmiya, she is the sister of the

complainant and the 2nd accused. Her evidence corroborates the evidence of the

complainant on salient points. It is worthy to note that her evidence was not

contradicted on any material points.

Ms. Dharshika Mallika Beatrice Abeywardana, Additional Registrar of Lands was the

next witness called by the prosecution. She gave evidence and submitted that the 1st

accused had submitted deeds bearing numbers 2147 and 2148. It is her evidence that

the pt accused had attested those deeds and they were properly registered.

Police Investigator Sankaran Rajendran was the next witness called by the prosecution.

He told the court about the investigation and recovery of documents.

Mohamed Ismail Mohamed Rafeek was called by the prosecution. Initially he was

reluctant in giving evidence hence the State treated him as an adverse witness,

subsequently he filled an affidavit and gave evidence that he did so because he was

influenced by the 1 st accused. His evidence further corroborated the case for the

prosecution.

When the State Counsel closed the case for the Prosecution the trial Judge called for

the defence of the accused persons. The 1 st accused appellant opted to give evidence

CA 57-58/2006 JUDGMENT Page 6 of8

!I

under oaths and the 3rd accused appellant made a statement from the dock. Both

denied their involvement and submitted that the complainant voluntarily signed the

deeds.

When the 1 st accused gave evidence and said on the day in question he was appearing

at the District Court of Kalutara, appearing in couple of cases, the State not only

suggested that fact is wrong but also called the Registrar of the District Court Ms.

Wanninayake Mudiyanselage Heenamma Kumarihami to give evidence. There, the

witness submitted evidential proof that those cases were not taken up on that date

and there is no record to show that this accused was in courts on that date.

Considering the evidence and comprehensive reasons given by the learned trial judge,

we find that the learned High Judge was satisfied that the prosecution had proved the

case beyond reasonable doubt. Independently when we peruse the evidence, we are

of the view that the prosecution had proved the necessary ingredients of the charges

levelled under section 454,459 of the Penal Code and also 39 (d), 34 to be read with

31 (3) of the notaries Ordinance.

The learned counsel for the accused appellants submitted that the Prosecution had

failed to call the Government Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD), hence they

failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Considering the submissions made

by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG), and the evidence of this case,

we find that there is no question of TESTING or EXAMINING a document. In this case

parties agreed that it was their signature, the only question is that it was not signed

for the purpose stated in the document in question. Further perusing the deeds in

dispute anyone could see the way those are typed. Especially the typing at the place

where the signatures are placed. It is so obvious to any person to come to a conclusion

that these documents were filled after obtaining the signatures. We are convinced with

CA 57-58/2006 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 8

I

tI

the submission of the SDSG that there was no necessity to refer these documents to

the EQD.

Considering all available materials especially the reasons given by the learned trial

Judge, we agree with the findings of the learned judge of the High Court that the

Prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. We find no merit in the

grounds of appeal and dismiss the appeal.

Regarding the Sentence we find the learned trial Judge was very reasonable in

evaluating the facts of the case and imposing adequate sentence. We have no reason

to interfere with the said sentence.

After carefully considering all arguments, and evidence before us, we dismiss the

appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence.
