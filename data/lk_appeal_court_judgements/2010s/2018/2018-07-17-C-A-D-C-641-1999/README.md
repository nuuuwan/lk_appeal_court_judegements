T

his is an appeal against the order of the learned District Judge of Matak dated

26.03.l999 which refused to set aside the judgement entered upon default of

appearance of the 1st Plaintiff in the case on 11.12.l997. The factual background to the

case becomes apposite. The 1st Plaintiff along with her son,the 2nd Plaintiff (the

Plaintiff, Appellants before this Court) instituted this action against the Defendant,

Respondents and their 2nd amended plaint dated 27.08.l993 averred inter alia that:

2

(a) The Defendants, without any rights whatsoever, had forcibly entered the

property as depicted in the second schedule to the amended plaint dated

27.08.1993 and cut and destroyed some of the trees on the plaintiff's property,

thereby causing severe damage and loss to the Plaintiffs.

(b) The Plaintiffs, their predecessors in title and all those holding under them had

been in possession of the property depicted in schedules 1 and 2 for over lO

years and as a result they had obtained prescriptive possession of the property.

(c) The Defendants had forcibly entered the property and paddy field depicted in

schedule 2 of the amended plaint and consequently the Plaintiffs continued to

suffer loss amounting to a sum of Rs 500 per month:

Thus the Plaintiffs sought a declaratory relief praying for the eviction of the Defendants

from the lands described in schedules 1 and 2 to the plaint.

The original 1st and 2nd Defendants filed their answer on 28.Ol.1994 traversing inter alia

that:~

(a) they disputed the claim of ownership by the Plaintiffs;

(b) they had been in uninterrupted possession of the land since 1938 and in 1988

the Plaintiffs who had no title or ownership and/or never possessed the said

land sought to cause problems to the Defendants on or about 17.05.1988.

In other words the 1st and 2nd Defendants claimed the property on a different pedigree

and sought a dismissal of the action.

Disputing the title of the Plaintiffs inter alia, the 3rd and 4th Defendants also prayed for a

dismissal of the plaint in their amended answer dated 11.03.l994.

On 3l.07.l997, the trial was fixed for 11.l2.l997 ~the fateful day that has given rise to this

appeal on the part of the Plaintiffs.

Absence of the Plaintiffs on 11.12.1997

Admittedly this was the first date of trial but as neither the Plaintiffs nor were their

representatives were present in Court, on an application made by counsel for the

Defendants, the action was dismissed with costs/vide Journal Entry No.42 at page 42 of

the appeal brief.

Application to Purge Default

By a petition dated 29.12.1997, only the 1st Plaintiff moved the District Court to have the

order of dismissal for default of appearance set aside. At the conclusion of the purge/

default inquiry, the learned District Judge of Matak refused the application to have the

order of dismissal set aside.

The main reason that underpins the judgment of the learned District Judge of Matale is

that a witness who testified on behalf of the 1st Plaintiff/an Ayurvedic doctor cannot be

believed.

The testimony on behalf of the 1st Plaintiff came from two professionals namely Dr.

Fahim from the Raththotta Hospital and one Ayurvedic physician called Gunapala

Welgama. In fact they gave evidence first before the 1st Plaintiff testified.

Dr. Hameed Mohamed Fahim giving evidence testified that the 1st Plaintiff was

admitted to the hospital with a complaint of stomach ache and vomiting on the 12th and

she was discharged on the 15th. It is worth noting that the trial date was the nth but the

date of admission was the 12th. But the fact remains that there was this government

doctor who asserted that the 1st Plaintiff had been hospitalized at the Raththota

hospital a day after the date of trial and it resonates with the rest of the evidence that

she had been sick on the nth. Dr. Fahim's evidence and his testimonial trustworthiness

were not challenged seriously. In a nutshell Dr. Fahim testified to the effect that the 1st

Plaintiff Pinchi Amma was hospitalized from 12.12.1997 till 15.12.1997. The witness

further stated that the patient was examined by the former D.M.O. and the Diagnosis

Sheet showed that she was suffering from stomach pains and was vomiting and Dr.

4

Fahim went on to state that he too treated the patient. He also testified that as the

patient was getting better and recovering she was released on the 15th. The record

maintained at the hospital and the bed head ticket indicated that she had gastritis.

The next witness was one Welgama the A yurvedic Physician. He produced the medical

certificate that he had issued to the Plaintiff on 12.02.1997. According to him, the

symptoms manifested by the patient connoted that she was weak and dizzy and he also

stated that he had treated her from 05.12.1997 onwards albeit intermittently and the

treatment was repetitive from this date. The medical certificate PI shows that she was

recommended leave from 05.12.1997 to 12.121997.

The tenor of the argument advanced before this Court was that there was no

documentary evidence in support of the position that the Plaintiff had been treated

form 05.12.1997 till 12.12.1997. But this witness quite categorically stated that the

Plaintiff had asked for a medical certificate on the nth but he gave the certificate on the

12th and from the categorical evidence given by Welgama it is not inconceivable that she

was not in a position to move about. With the evidence of both the 1st Plaintiff and

Welgama~the Ayurvedic Physician taken in their correct perspective, it is apparent that

she had been obtaining treatment regularly from the 5th December to nth December.

Cumulatively the follOwing points of salience emerge from the testimony of the two

witnesses~the Plaintiff had been certainly sick. She had been hospitalized from 12th

December to 15th December and the A yurvedic Doctor had treated her from the 5th

onwards and a medical certificate was given to her only on the 12th, though requested

on the nth. This clearly shows that the illness was not a figment concocted by the tt

Plaintiff.

The Counsel for the tt Plaintiff~ Appellant posed the question~ If two professionals

qualified in medicine state that the Plaintiff had been sick and was not recommended to

travel why could not this evidence be accepted? Both men were not intimately known

to the Plaintiff. No suggestion was ever made to them to this effect. They came off as

independent witnesses. Having gone through the evidence of these two witnesses I find

5

that the witnesses were giving direct evidence of what they saw, heard and perceived. It

does not appear to this Court that the medical certificates of these two doctors were

given to suit the story of the 1st Plaintiff.

Pinchi Amma~the 1st Plaintiff testified that as she had been ill on the nth December 1997

she had to visit an Ayurvedic Doctor to be treated with medicines on the nth. At page 85

of the brief she describes as to how herillness had progressed rather than regressed. She

first fell ill on the 5th and she was too weak to get up or walk. So she first got treatment

from an Ayurvedic Doctor called Welgama and as she did not get better, she went to a

Government hospital. She was warded therein for 4 days. It goes without saying that if

the Plaintiff had not been so sick as she described, she would not have been kept as a

patient for 4 days.

Her testimony reveals the fact that she had asked for a medical certificate on the nth but

it was given only on the 12th and collected by her son. There is corroboration of this

testimony to a great degree by the two medical men. But there is a misappreciation of

evidence as the learned District Judge wonders as to how the Plaintiff could get a

medical certificate from the Ayurvedic doctor if she had been in the hospital on the 12th.

The observation of the learned District Judge on this score is thus erroneous having

regard to the fact that the medical certificate was collected by her son.

What strikes this Court as a factor to be taken cognizance of is the evidence of two

doctors who had treated the 1st Plaintiff successively and no suggestion was ever made

that they were lying on oath. In this context the perennial observation of H.N.G.

Fernando, J. in the case of Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de Silva 70 N.L.R. 165 at 179

becomes applicable.

"If the petitioner leads evidence and the respondent does not contradict it, this is an additional

"matter before the Court," which the definition in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance reqUires

the Court to take into account".

6

.. The Defendant remained silent by not posing any questions on the testimonial

trustworthiness of these two witnesses and it is additional proof of the fact in issue and

therefore the witnesses have to be believed.

Apart from the evidence that transpired at the purge~default inquiry, Journal Entry

No.42 of 11.12.1997 indicates that it was the 1st date of trial. On this date the Plaintiff and

their Attorney~at~ Law had been absent and the Court dismissed the plaint.

Journal Entry No.Sl indicates that on 06.01.1998 the Plaintiff filed papers with notice to

the contesting parties seeking to get the matter relisted. The application to purge

default was dismissed on 26.03.1999.

In my view the learned District Judge of Matak failed to appreciate the probabilities

that arose on evidence and they indicate that the Plaintiff fell ill on the 11th December

1997. This was a land action for which the Plaintiffs sought vindication and in my view

the Plaintiff made out a case that her illness on the 11th prevented her from attending

Court on the day in question. The learned District Judge should have been guided by

the testimony of the two men who spoke to a continuous stroke of ill health on the part

of the 1st Plaintiff and both the doctors corroborated her.

In the circumstances I decide to allow the appealand set aside the order of dismissal

made on 26.03.1999 in regard to the application to purge default. The order dated

11.12.1997 dismissing the plaint of the Plaintiff is also set aside.

I direct the learned District Judge of Matak to proceed with the trial according to law

and on the pleadings that have already been filed.
