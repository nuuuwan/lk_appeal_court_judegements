ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

"1st and 2nd Appellants" ) were indicted before the High Court of Panadura

, for committing murder of Chamudi Kaushalya Fernando on 13th December

1992. After a jury trial, both Appellants were convicted for murder upon

unanimous verdict and were sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by their conviction and sentence, the Appellants

sought to challenge its legality on several grounds of appeal.

The 1st Appellant raised following grounds of appeal in his written

su bmissions;

a. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on the presumption of

innocence and burden of proof

b. the trial Court misdirected regarding the defence of alibi

c. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on the principle of common

intention

d. the trial Court failed to direct the Jury on Section 114(f) of the

Evidence Ordinance

e. the trial Court failed to direct the Jury on Section 134 of the

Evidence Ordinance

f. the trial Court failed to direct the Jury regarding the necessity of

proof of omissions and contradictions

g. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on assessing credibility of the

defence witnesses

2

h. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on identification of the

accused

1. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on evaluation and assessing

credibility of the witnesses

The 2nd Appellant raised following grounds of appeal In his written

submissions;

a. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on the presumption of

innocence and burden of proof

b. the trial Court misdirected regarding the defence of alibi

c. the trial Court failed to direct the Jury on Section 114(f) o(the

Evidence Ordinance

d. the trial Court failed to direct the Jury on Section 134 of the

Evidence Ordinance

e. the trial Court misdirected the Jury on assessing credibility of the

wi tnesses called by him

f. there are highly prejudicial comments made by the learned High

Court Judge in that they have effectively and incorrectly

narrowed down the scope of the Jury assessing the credibility of

the wi tnesses.

In view of the above quoted grounds of appeal as urged by the

Appellants, it is appropriate at the outset of this judgment to consider the

case for the prosecution that had been presented before the Jury.

3

The prosecution primarily relied on the eye witness testimony of

PW1 Wasantha Sriyani to establish the charge against the Appellants.

It is stated by the witness that she had come to live in Kaikawala

about three months prior to the incident. 1ne deceased is her-20 months

old daughter. On the day of the incident, at about 7.15 in the evening she

heard a knock on her kitchen door. She opened it with the impression that

it was her husband who usually arrives home at that time. She saw the two

Appellants just outside her door. They came into the house uninvited. Her

house was lit by oil lamps. She identified both Appellants. The 2nd

Appellant had a large wooden club and a manna knife in his hands. The 1st

Appellant was unarmed.

As they entered her house through the kitchen door, the 2nd

Appellant said that they came for a particular "business" and wanted her

child. She retorted back saying that she had not raised children to be given

away to them. The 2nd Appellant then went to the bed on which the

deceased infant was sleeping and had inflicted three cut injuries on her

neck area. The 1st Appellant had threatened the witness not to shout and

had then attempted to prevent her leaving the house. She however,

succeeded in her attempt to leave the house and ran directly to her

neighbour Kanmawathie claiming her "child is finished" Thereafter, the

witness returned to her house with Kanmawathie and Kamal, another

m~ighbour of hers. She had picked up her child from the bed and saw the

pillow was soaked in blood. Her husband too had arrived at this juncture

and he immediately took away their child to Horana hospital in a motor

cycle.

4

-.

The witness too had gone to the hospital with the pillow of the child

in another motor cycle with one Nishantha. At the hospital, they learnt that

the child was dead. The witness had narrated what she witnessed to the

medical officer, implicating the Appellants. Thereafter, the witness and her

husband went to Horana police to make a complaint but were redirected to

l'v1oragahahena Police where they finally made a complaint at about 10.00

p.m. about the death of their daughter.

The evidence of Dr. Ariyasinghe, who performed the post mortem

examination on the body of the deceased, is that she has suffered 3 deep

cut injuries located on- the right side of her neck parallel to each other.

Particularly the injury No. 1 had penetrated cranial cavity by cutting

through her skull bone and had thereby caused damage to outer

membrane to the brain. There were no injuries caused to her brain, but her

death was due to haemorrhagic shock. He believed her death could have

occurred within 15 minutes of receiving such injuries due to heavy loss of

blood as some of the blood vessels were also cut.

The Police evidence revealed that Moragahahena Police received 1st

information on the same night at 10.00 p.m. from PW1 and, having visited

the scene at 11.15 p.m., the 1st Appellant was arrested from his home on

the same night at 3.30 a.m. The 2nd Appellant surrendered to Court on

15.12.1992.

5

-.

On inspection of the crime scene, IP Rajapakse observed a chimney

lamp still burning and there was a polythene sheet with stains like blood

on a bed. He also noted a mosquito net by the bed and some cooked food

in the kitchen.

At the close of the prosecution case, the trial Court called for defence

from the Appellants. They gave evidence under oath and called witnesses

in support of their alibi.

In this backdrop of evidence, we now tum to consider the several

grounds of appeal of the Appellants.

At the hearing of this appeal, learned President's Counsel for the 1st

Appellant modified his grounds of appeal and amalgamated some. He had

then made extensive submissions on the alleged failure of the trial Court to

follow the "mandatory" statutory provisions contained in Section 227(2) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as it failed to

administer the oath of separation on the Jury on each day at the end of the

day's proceedings. He relied on the judgments of K v Appuhamy 46 N.L.R.

304, The Queen v Aladdin 61 N.L.R. 7, Fernando v The Queen 76 N.L.R.160

and In re Lilian Rajapakse 72 N.L.R. 352 and requests this Court to

"pronounce whether the provision is mandatory or not". The 2nd

Appellant also associated himself with this submission.

6

The learned Senior State Counsel in his reply on this ground of

appeal contended that there is no such "mandatory" requirement to

administer an oath of separation at adjournment and in this instance the

learned High Court Judge has adopted a more effective method of

ensunng that there is no external communication by the Jurors by

directing them of the importance of observing the restriction to

communicate.

Section 227(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, states that

"where the jury is allowed to separate during the course of any trial the jurors

may be first sworn or affirmed not to hold communications with any person other

than a fellow juror upon the subject of the-trial during such separation."

In Regina v Pinhamy 57 N.L.R. 169, Basnayake ACJ (as he was then)

observed thus;

"Jurors are administered an oath of separation whenever the

Court adjourns. By that oath Jurors undertake not to hold

communication with any person other than a fellow juror upon

the subject of the trial during their separation.

In view of that oath the need for the Judge satisfying himself that

there has been in fact an improper conversation between Juror and

witness is greater. For a discJzarge without inquiry may cast on

the Juror an undeserved reflection that Jze had acted contrary to

the terms of hIS oath. A Juror should be free to talk to anyone on

matters unconnected with the subject to the trial. it would be an

interference with the rights of the Jurors if they were to totally

debarred from conversing with n witness under nny

circumstances. Nevertheless, prudence demnnds that n Juror

7

should avoid conversing in public with a witness during a trial.

similarly, a witness should avoid conversation with a Juror in

public however familiar and friendly he may be with him in

private life. The importance attached to keeping the jury beyond

any kind of influence can be realised from the fact that in the early

days in England Jurors are kept together from the commencement

of the trial till its conclusion. But today we are satisfied with the

safeguard of an oath of separation. The greater is the need

therefore not only to ensure that the oath is observed strictly but

also make it appear that it is so observed. II

It is evident from the above quotation that the emphasis should be

on "keeping the jury beyond any kind of influence" during their tenure of office

as Jurors. The Legislature in its wisdom thought it fit to achieve this

objective by administering an oath of separation at adjournments. But it

did not think fit to impose such a condition as a mandatory obligation on

the trial Court as it used the word "may" and did not lay down any

consequence, in the event of failure to administer such an oath. Section 9 of

the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance provided that "no omission to take

any oath or make any affirmation ... shall invalidate any proceedings or render

inadmissible any evidence whatever in or in respect of riJhich such omission,

substitution or irregularity took place, or shall affect the obligation of a witness to

state the truth."

In the instant appeal, instead of administering an oath of separation,

the trial Court took the responsibility to itself to warn the Jurors not to

8

have any communication about the trial with outsiders. This warning, as

admitted by the 1st Appellant, was repeated faithfully by the trial Court on

every adjournment.

We do not propose to impose a mandatory duty on a trial Court in

complying with Section 227(2) when the Legislature opted not to. None of

the authorities relied upon by the 1st Appellant held such a view. In the

circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that, in this particular

instance, the failure to administer an oath of separation had not caused any

prejudice to the Appellants denying their right to a fair trial, in view of the

trial Court's repeated warnings reminding the Jurors not to indulge in any

communications other than with the fellow Jurors in relation to the trial

before them and in the absence of any allegation that the verdict of the

Jury was corrupt due to outside influence.

However, we take this opportunity to re-emphasisc the importance

of strict adherence to the statutorily laid down procedure in which a Jury

trial is conducted since the Jurors are not persons who are learned in law

and Court procedures. All Courts must ensure that those provisions are

faithfully given effect to as it is vital for the prosecution as well as to the

accused to have a fair trial.

Connected to this ground of appeal, the 1st Appellant also claimed

that the trial Court had failed to comply with the provisions of Section

223(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, at the end of the summing

up. Learned President's Counsel invited our attention to p.l097 of the

9

appeal brief where it is recorded that the Jurors are only handed over to

the Registrar of the Court.

Section 223(2) lays down the procedure to be followed once the

summing up is concluded by the trial Court. When the Jury retires" they

shall be committed to the charge of the Court" and the Court had complied

with that requirement. The Court officer in whose responsibility that the

Jury was placed must then administer an oath on them in the prescribed

form. There is no reference in the record of such compliance.

It is also observed that throughout the proceedings it is evident that

at the commencement of further trial for each day the oath was

administered, and that fact had been recorded. This indicates the Court

officers were aware of the importance of administering such an oath on

Jurors. In this particular instance, it had not been recorded that the

Registrar had administered the oath when the summing up was

concluded.

In Attorney General v Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292, the Supreme

Court held that;

"Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance contains the presumption

that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed or

done with due regard to form and procedure... VVlzile the

presumption is used sparingly in criminal cases, it will be

presumed even in a murder case that a man acting in public

10

capacity has properly discharged his official duties, until the

contrary is proven (vide R v Gordon (1989) Leach 515)."

As noted above, the administering of the oath on Jurors had been

done regularly throughout the trial by the relevant Court official. It

appears that the Jury retired for deliberations late in the evening and it is

therefore reasonable to infer that the oath had been administered as usually

done by the Court official but due to an oversight that fact had not been

recorded. As such the presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence

Ordinance applies, as decided by the apex Court.

Learned President's Counsel, in support of the ground of appeal in

relation to alibi contended that the trial Court directed the Jury to compare

the cases of prosecution and defence side by side and thereby violated

fundamental principle of criminal law as laid down in lames Silva v The

Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 167 where it was held n to examine

the evidence of the accused in the light of the prosecution is to reverse the

presumption of innocence". He referred to pages 1071 and 1072 of the brief

where these references are made in the summing up.

Examination of the summing up of the trial Court, we find that the

references to comparison of evidence is made in relation to alibi has no such

objectionable feature. The trial Court, having dealt with the prosecution

evidence invited the Jury to consider whether it is acceptable or not. If it is

not acceptable, then the Jury was told to give that benefit to the Appellants.

11

Then the trial Court referred to the evidence of the Appellants. The trial

Court directed the Jury that if they accept that evidence then the defence is

successful. If that evidence could not have accepted, then the defence has

failed. The reference of comparison of evidence is in relajion to the

evidence of each appellant and the witnesses called by them and not in

relation to the evidence of sole eye witness to the prosecution (p.1072).

The 1st Appellant then addressed us that the trial Court failed to

distinguish between common and similar intentions and left this question

of fact to be inferred from the illustration given by the Court in its

-summing up and thereby acted in violation of Section 229 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

It is clear from the perusal of the summing up that the trial Court

invited the attention of the Jury to the submissions made by the Appellants

in relation to the concepts of similar and common intention before it

ventured to offer directions on the point. Having reminded them on the

submissions of the Appellants, the trial Court directed the Jury to an

illustration and had dealt extensively on this aspect particularly at page

979, where it clearly directed them that common intention and similar

intentions are two distinct concepts. The trial Court also directed them of

the instances where there is common intention and where there is similar

intention. It further directed them when a similar intention transforms

itself and thereby becomes common intention.

12

The 1st Appellant relied on the evidence of the PW1 to impress upon

us that there was no common intention by referring to the evidence of the

prosecution where PW1 clearly admitted that he did nothing and had no

arms with him at the time of intrusion.

In countering this submission, learned Senior State Counsel

submitted that there is ample evidence to infer the common murderous

intention of the 1st Appellant he shared with the 2nd Appellant. He relied on

the evidence of PW1 that it was the 1st Accused who prevented her from

seeking help by restricting her movements and thereby ensured that none -

of them seen -and apprehended at the scene itself by her neighbours.

The evidence of PW1 clearly implicated the 1st Appellant having a

common murderous intention shared with the other Appellant. The two of

them entered the house uninvited and demanded her daughter. PW 1

retorted back marking her protest. Then the 2nd Appellant cut the infant

with a manna knife while the 1st Appellant prevented PW1 from calling out

help by shouting or seeking help by running to her neighbours. At no

point of time the 1st Appellant made an attempt, at least verbally, to

prevent the 2nd Accused from repeatedly inflicting cut injuries on the neck

of the sleeping infant with a manna knife. The entire episode lasted less

than five minutes and both Appellants have disappeared into darkness

before the arrival of neighbours upon being alerted by PWI.

13

These circumstances amply justify drawing of an inference of

common murderous intention of the 1st Appellant that is shared with the

2nd Appellant as the "necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the

case and an inference from which there is no escape" as per the Jy.dgment of

Wijesinghe and three Others v The State (1984) 1 Sri L.R. 155.

In addition, the 1st Appellant made submissions as to the erroneous

evaluation of the evidence of PW1 on the basis that the version and

sequence of events as narrated by her is improbable when viewed in the

ordinary conduct of people. He particularly relied on the evidence of PW1

". lhat she dId "not implicate any of the Appellants when -she" ran to

Karunawathi for help and her husband did not even ask her who is

responsible for this when he rushed home. The 1st Appellant claimed that

non-disclosure of a known suspect raises a reasonable doubt as to the

truthfulness of PW1.

The evaluation of the evidence of PW1 is a question of fact attributed

to the Jury and they found it credible. We are in agreement with this

finding. It is correct that PW1 did not implicate any of the Appellant until

she was questioned by the medical officer who pronounced the death of

her infant. This behaviour had to be considered in the light of the

circumstances under which the witness was placed at.

14

It is her evidence that when the Appellants forced themselves into

her house that evening she initially thought they have come to sexually

molest her. She did not suspect that the 2nd Appellant would attack the

sleeping infant with the manna knife he was armed with. No~ doubt she

was frightened at the sight and as she claimed. The thought of escaping

death crossed her mind. She ran out of the house overpowering the

resistance offered by the 1st Appellant when she saw what happened to her

child. She only said to Karunawathii that her "child is finished". Then she

rushed back to her house with two of her neighbours directly to where her

infant was. She had then picked her up from the blood-soaked pillow.

What was foremost in her mind was to take the child to a hospital. Then

---her husband arrived. Without wasting time, he grabbed their child and

rushed her to hospital in a pillion of a motor cycle. PWl too got into the

next available motor cycle and rushed to hospital with the pillow, only to

be told that the child was dead.

She provided an acceptable answer as to her delay as she said what

was foremost in her mind was to save her child and not to give description

of the attack to anyone. She implicated the Appellants, in her complaint to

Police made in less than three hours since the incident. Considering the fact

that they initially went to Horana Police from the hospital to lodge a

complaint only to be turned away and it was at 10.00 p.m. her statement

was finally recorded, we find the delay in implicating the Appellants are

justified in the circumstances.

15

The 1st Appellant complained that the trial Court put" embroidery"

in its summing up by providing an explanation for the delay in making a

statement to Police at p. 995. This complaint is based on the directions

given by the trial Court to the effect that Police would <not record

complaints as you go to them and to have her complaint recorded at 10.00

p.m. PW1 would have to turned up at Police by at least 9.30 p.m. This

sentence ends with the invitation to consider what the trial Court had

directed on these lines. There was no determination by the trial Court of

the delay is justified.

It would have been more appropriate if the trial Court left these

considerations in a different presentation directing the Jury to utilise their

knowledge as members of public whether the delay in reporting to police

is justified under the circumstances. However, we find no prejudice caused

to the Appellant with this direction even if it is considered not appropriate,

when considering the directions given during the entirety of the summing

up.

Another ground urged by the 1st Appellant is what he termed as

"Ellenborough syndrome" and this is based on, as alleged by him, by

"arguing for the prosecution" and showing "partiality" as disclosed in

pages 1019 and 1020 of the appeal brief. Upon perusal of the segment of the

summing up contained in these two pages, it is revealed that the trial Court

was merely inviting attention of the Jury as to the conduct of the PW1

when the intrusion by the Appellants into her house that evening. The trial

Court wanted the Jury to consider the several probabilities of her conduct.

16

With due respect to the submissions of the learned President's Counsel, we

do not find any objectionable direction on the part of the trial Court in

these two pages.

Lastly the complaint by the 1st Appellant that the trial Court failed to

record some remarks it made during the cross examination by the 1st

Appellant of PW1. The proceedings revealed that there was some

observations made by the trial Court and communicated that in English

language to the learned Counsel for the 1st Appellant in the presence of the

Jury. Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant who appeared for him at the

trial requested the Court to record them, but the Court decided not to. The

record does not indicate the content of the observation or at least any

indication as to the topic on which such observations were made. In the

absence of any record, we are not in a position to make a positive

determination. It must be recorded that it is always best for the trial Courts

to make whatever observations on the conduct of the Counsel in the

absence of the Jury. The fact that there was no application to discharge the

Jury by the Appellants after this episode indicates that it did not have an

adverse effect on the minds of the Jury in relation to the Appellants.

The 2nd Appellant, whilst associating himself with the grounds of

appeal as raised by the 1st Appellant, nonetheless relied on an exclusive

ground of appeal that his defence of alibi had been wrongly rejected by the

Jury upon misdirection and non-direction by the trial Court on its

evaluation as to its credibility. He submitted that he suggested his defence

of alibi to the prosecution witnesses before he took up it in his evidence

under oath maintaining consistency.

17

There was no omission or contradiction was marked off his defence. The

trial Court had commented upon his belatedness in making the defence

and also had commented of his surrendering to Court after several days

after the incident, when there was no evidence of II absconding:'. He drew

our attention to the directions to the Jury in pages 1980 and 1087 where the

trial Court, having referred to the evidence of the 2nd Appellant that he

heard a shouting from the direction of PW1's house and had then ran

towards it, directed the Jury to consider the evidence of his witness who

has given an inconsistent evidence.

The 2nd Appellant then referred to the direction of the trial Court at

p.1087 where it is stated that the ~itn~sses called lJ.y the 2nd Appellant had. ,

taken II different positions". It must be noted that this particular statement

follows the directions that the evidence given by the wife of the 2nd

Appellant is inconsistent when questioned by the prosecution and by

Court. Then the trial Court proceeded to direct the Jury to consider

whether that evidence is consistent with the evidence of the 2nd Appellant.

When considered these directions in the context in which it is stated, we

find no wrong in inviting attention of the Jury to the inconsistencies of

evidence in assisting to evaluate the credibility of the evidence of the 2nd

Appellant. There is no difference in the process of evaluating the credibility

of evidence, whether that evidence is presented by the prosecution or by

the accused. In evaluating any evidence the same yardstick would apply.

The trial Court is duty bound to assist the Jurors to evaluate the credibility

of evidence placed before them irrespective of the party presented them. In

this instance the Court was merely fulfilling its duty by assisting them in

evaluation of evidence.

18

In the circumstances, we are of the view that there is no merit in the'

appeals of the Appellants and therefore their appeals ought to be

dismissed. Therefore, we affirm the conviction and sentence of the

Appellants and proceed to dismiss their appeals.
