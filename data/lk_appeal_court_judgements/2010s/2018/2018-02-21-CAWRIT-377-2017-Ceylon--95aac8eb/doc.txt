P. PADMAN SURASENA J (PICA)

When the cases bearing Nos. CA (Writ) 377/2017 and CA

(Writ) 378/2017 came up for support before this Court, learned

Senior State Counsel informed this Court that the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue has decided to accept the appeals

produced marked 'PS' (in both cases) filed by the petitioner, as

Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006. As the relief prayed for by the

petitioners in these two applications is to compel the Commissioner

Revenue to conclude the appeals filed before him within two years

from the date of the receipt of the appeals. In view of that

requirement learned Counsel for the petitioner agrees that the period

of two years mentioned in Section 165(14) be treated as having

reckoned from the date of receipt of the appeals by the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, i.e. 01.02.2018. Learned Counsel for the

petitioner therefore agrees that the two year period referred to in

Section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 must be

calculated from 01.02.2018 onwards.

Subject to these terms, the learned Counsel for the

petitioner moves to withdraw these applications. The application for

withdrawal is allowed. The applications are dismissed without costs.
