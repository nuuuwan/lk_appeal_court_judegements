Decided on 05.12.2017

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

A preliminary objection has been taken to the maintainability of this appeal. In a

nutshell the contention of the Plaintiff/Respondent is that the petition of appeal dated

09.12.1999 does not contain a prayer for setting aside the judgment of the court a quo

and therefore it is fatally flawed. Mr. Anuruddha Dharmaratne for the Plaintiff/

Respondent quite eloquently submitted that it is imperative that the petition of appeal

must contain a demand for relief namely a prayer that the judgment of the District

Court be set aside. He submitted that it is only then that the petition of appeal would

comply with Section 755(3) and Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Code" or "CPC").

The impugned petition of appeal before this Court contains only the following plea /

"It is respectfully, submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed".

Signed

Attomey/at/ Law for the Appellants

Both Counsel for the Plaintiff/Respondent and Ms. MokshiniJayamanne for the 26th

Defendant/ Respondent on behalf of the legal aid commission contended that the

aforesaid sentence / "It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed" would

not suffice for purposes of Section 755(3) and 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Both counsel chorused in unison that the way in which the petition of appeal is

couched as above, would not qualify, without more, to be a proper petition of appeal

and hence it has to be rejected in limine.

The argument was that the petition of appeal must pray for what the counsel called a

"substantive relief" such as a demand that the judgment of the District Court be set

aside and an "incidental relief" such as ''plaintiff's action be dismissed". Only then the

6

-petition of appeal will become compliant with Sections 755(3) and 758(1)(f) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

At this stage both the above provisions of the Code bear scrutiny.

Section 755(3) Code states as follows:~

"Every appellant shall within sixty days from the date of the judgment or decree appealed

against, present to the original court, a petition of appeal setting out the circumstances out of

which the appeal arises and the grounds of objection to the judgment or decree appealed

against, and containing the particulars reqUired by section 758, which shall be Signed by the

appellant or his registered attorney. Such petition of appeal shall be exempt from stamp duty.

Provided that, if such petition is not presented to the original court within sixty days from the

date of the judgment or decree appealed against, the court shall refuse to receive the appeal."

Section 758(1) which is a concomitant accompaniment to Section 755(3) reads thus:~

"The petition of appeal shall be distinctly written upon good and suitable paper, and shall

contain the followingparticulars:~

(a) the name of the court in which the case is pending;

(b) the names of the parties to the action;

(c) the names of the appellant and of the respondent;

(d) the address to the Court of Appeal;

(e) a plain and concise statement of the grounds of objection to the judgment, decree, or

order appealed against~ such statement to be set forth in duly numbered paragraphs; form

of relief

(f) a demand of the form of relief claimed"

At first blush upon a careful reading of the two provisions it would appear that "a

demand of the form of relief claimed" as described in Section 758(1)(f) of the Code is an

indispensable adjunct to a petition of appeal because the word "shall" is used in the

7

chapeau of Section 758(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Has such a demand been made

for a form of relief in the petition of appeal? If so, is it sufficient for purposes of

Section 758(1)(f) of the CPC?

The form of rellef that has been couched in the petition of appeal goes as follows: /

"It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed"

Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC submitted in his forceful reply to the prehminary objection

that the precatory words / "It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed" is

certainly a demand as a demand could well be. A demand could be a precatory plea as

above and the draftsman of the provincial bar who formulated the petition of appeal

did not commit a cardinal sin when he put pen to paper what he thought he must

demand of the Court of Appeal. But Mr. Anuruddha Dharmaratne submitted that

there has to be an order in which the rellef must sequentially be demanded from the

Court of Appeal namely,

1. the judgment of the District Court be set aside

2. dismiss the plaintiff's action

3. any other rellef

In the petition of appeal under impugnation, Mr. Anurudda Dharmaratne submitted

that the above order is missing or the absence of prayer (1) above from the petition of

appeal renders the petition incurably deficient and so it must be dismissed. He

further argued that the sentence "It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be

dismissed" is not a demand and additional forms of rellefs must have been demanded

such as "the judgment of the District Court be set aside."

As opposed to this contention, Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC submitted that a demand

could be respectful and the words "It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be

dismissed" amount to nothing but an unambiguous form of demand which duly

complles with Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code.

8

If I may summarize Mr. Anuruddha Dhramaratne's argument in yet another way, the

learned Counsel argued that there must be prayers that must plead the following

namely "appeal be allowed" and "the judgment of the District Court be set aside". If

these prayers are not inserted in a petition of appeal, such a petition of appeal must be

dismissed in limine. The learned President's Counsel countered this by contending that

this objection was being raised rather late in the day and such a belated objection was

being put forward to deprive the appellants of the merits of their appeal being

investigated by this Court and in fact the learned President's Counsel invoked the

celebrated words of Sydney Abraham, CJ in Dulfa Umma et al v. u.D.e. Matale 40

N.LR. 474 at p. 478:~

"Civil procedure should be a vehicle which conveys a litigant safely, expeditiously and cheaply

along the road which leads to justice and not a juggernaut car which throws him out and then

runs over him leaving him maimed and broken on the road."

Ms. Mokshini Jayamanne who appeared for the 26th Defendant~Respondent

associated herself with the submissions made by Mr. Anuruddha Dharmaratne.

If I once again summarize the submissions made towards the dismissal of the petition

of appeal, the pith and substance of the submission is that the plea "it is respectfully

submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed" does not satisfy Section 758(1)(f) of the

Civil Procedure Code. In other words it does not amount to a demand.

The petition of appeal must have incorporated pleas such as "appeal be allowed" or

"the judgment of the District Court be set aside". In fact, the argument was that no

relief has been claimed and so this Court must dismiss the petition of appeal.

Before I determine the interesting issue arising in this appeal, let me deal with some

case law that the Counsel for the Plaintiff~ Respondent cited to buttress his argument,

which succinctly put, meant "if there is no demand, there will be no relief".

Surangi v. Rodrigo (2003) 3 Sri LR. p.35 was the first case to be cited. Section 40( e)

of the Civil Procedure Code stipulates that a demand of the relief which the Plaintiff

9

claims must be specified as an essential particular in a plaint. Gamini Amaratunga J.

adverting to the above at p.38 of the judgment stated that no court is entitled or has

jurisdiction to grant rellefs to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the

plaint. The learned Judge cited Sirinivasa Thero v. Sudassi Thero 63 N.LR. 31;

Martin Singho v. Kularatne CA 248/1995 CA minutes of 18.l2.96; Wijesuriya v.

Senaratne(1997) 2 Sri LR. 323.

It has to be remembered that the failure to comply with Section 40( e) of the Code

does not result in an automatic dismissal of the plaint. Under Section 46(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code, the Court may return the plaint for amendment then and there,

or within such time as may be fixed by the Court. So ''no prayer for rellef, no relief" is

not a mantra that gives an unqualified llcence to reject the plaint. As far as plaints are

concerned, a curative provision exists in the form of Section 46(2) of the CPC to

ensure audi alteram partem. But the question before me is whether there is a relief or no

rellef at all that has been claimed in the petition. I take the view that the plea "It is

respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed" is certainly a form of rellef

demanded of the Court of Appeal as contemplated in Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil

Procedure Code. It is a demand, albeit in pollte terms, as there is no prohibition for

demands to be made in precatory terms. It is not as if a demand for a rellef has not

been prayed for in the petition of appeal. The invocation "the plaintiff's action be

dismissed" certainly qualifies to be a form of rellef as contemplated within the ambit of

Section 758(1) (f) of the Civil Procedure Code.

So in my view the allusion to Surangi v. Rodrigo (supra) could not be pertinent as

Justice Amaratunga was dealing with a situation where there was no demand at all

for permanent alimony in that case. In Surangi v. Rodrigo (supra), the Plaintiff

claimed a divorce on malicious desertion/constructive desertion from her husband

and also damages at Rs. 700,000// as permanent alimony. The Defendant contended in

the answer that the Plaintiff had no right to claim damages. The Plaintiff, after her

evidence was led, raised an issue whether the Plaintiff was entitled to permanent

10

alimony in a sum of Rs. 700,OOOr. This was objected to on the basis that there was no

prayer for permanent alimony. This was upheld by the District Court.

Upon appeal, Gamini Amaratunga J. held that;

1. No Court is entitled to or has jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a party which are

not prayed for in the plaint.

2. In the absence of a prayer for alimony, the Court was correct in refusing to

allow the Petitioner to frame an issue relating to alimony.

As I said before, the case before me does not present a situation where no relief has

been demanded in the petition of appeal. The relief demanded is that the action filed

in the District Court should be dismissed. The question is whether this Court

possesses the power to grant this relief in its appellate jurisdiction. The answer

would be in the affirmative for the following reason.

The power of the Court of Appeal on an appeal is set out in Section 773 of the Code:/

"Upon hearing the appeal, it shall be competent to the Court of Appeal to affirm, reverse,

correct or modify any judgment, decree, or order, according to law, or to pass such judgment,

decree or order therein between and as regards the parties, or to give such direction to the

court below, or to order a new trial or a further hearing upon such terms as the Court of

Appeal shall think fit, or, if need be, to receive and admit new evidence additional to, or

supplementary of, the evidence already taken in the court of first instance, touching the

matters at issue in any original cause, suit or action, as justice may require or to order a new

or further trial on the ground of discovery of fresh evidence subsequent to the trial."

In fact Articles 138 and 139(1) of the Constitution expatiate on the appellate

jurisdiction in extenso. Article 139(1) of the Constitution which is marginally titled as

Powers in appeal sets out as follows:/

The Court of Appeal may in the exercise of its jurisdiction, affirm, reverse, correct or modify

any order, decree or sentence according to law or it may give directions to such Court of First

11

Instance, tribunal or other institution or order a nevv trial or further hearing upon such terms

as the Court of Appeal shall think fit.

Thus one can see how both Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code and Article 139(1)

of the Constitution echo the identical language and mirror the appellate power of this

Court in similar import. They are so extensive enough to enable this Court to set

aside the judgment of the District Court and dismiss the case of the Plaintiff provided

this Court finds for the Defendant/Appellant. It has to be remembered that Section

773 does not use the words "allow the appeal or set aside the judgment of the District

Court" though these words do often appear in pleadings. But words to that effect are

reflected in the provisions. Words such as "affirm, reverse, correct or modify any judgment,

decree, or order .... " connote among other things the setting aside the judgment and once

it is done by the Court of Appeal, what follows would be the dismissal of the action.

Even the most commonplace pleadings do not pray for " reversals" but rather invoke a

"setting aside or allowing the appeal" words which are not found in Section 773 but

the legalese "setting aside the judgment", though not found in Section 773, passes

muster owing to its over frequent usage.

What then could be the objection to a petition of appeal that prays for the ultimate

relief namely "the plaintiff's action be dismissed"? Even if the exact formulae as found in

these provisions namely "affirm, reverse, correct or modify any judgment, decree, or order,

according to law, ...... " are not used by pleaders in their petitions of appeal, the Court of

Appeal in its final judgment achieves these results and one cannot then cry foul of a

petition of appeal that submits in precatory terms that the plaintiff's action be

dismissed.

As Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC quite rightly submitted, such an invocation is a form of

relief demanded of this Court and on reflection this conclusion that it is a demand as a

demand could be is also supportable having regard to the following considerations

too.

12

If in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction the Court of Appeal proceeds to reverse a

judgment, it would necessarily have the effect of dismissing the action of the Plaintiff

in the court below and if a Defendant~Appellant qua the Appellants before me submits

that the action be dismissed, it is implicit in that submission that he invokes the

appellate jurisdiction of this Court to do one of the acts stipulated in the aforesaid

provisions namely" ...... reverse the judgment, decree, or order, according to law, ...... ". Because

the Appellants have not used a particular form of words such as "the appeal be allowed"

or "the judgment of the District Court be set aside", it is no reason that their appeal must be

dismissed.

So it becomes clear that the relief sought in the petition of appeal namely "the plaintiff's

action be dismissed" is capable of being granted by this Court in its appellate jurisdiction

and therefore Surangi v. Rodrigo (supra) has no application at all to this case because

in Surangi there was no relief sought whereas in this case before me there is clearly a

relief sought namely "the plaintiff's action be dismissed". In the same way the case of

Weragama v. Bandara 77 N.L.R. 289 would be similarly inapposite to this appeal.

In this case the 1st Plaintiff had sought a declaration that he was the Maha Kapurala of

the Maha Saman Dewale. The trial Judge held that it had not been proved that there

was an office of Maha Kapurala of the Dewale. Nevertheless he answered the issues

framed relating to the 1st plaintiff's claim to be Maha Kapurala and granted him a

declaration that he was a Kapurala of the Dewale.

Samarawickrame J. held that the trial Judge had erred in granting the 1st Plaintiff relief

not prayed for and not claimed in the action by him.

As is apparent the instant appeal before me does not throw up such issues. The form

of relief demanded in the instant petition of appeal is the dismissal of the plaintiff's

action. At the end of the conclusion of this appeal, this relief is capable of being

granted by this Court if this Court takes the view that the appeal must be allowed

and the judgment of the learned District Judge should be set aside. Merely because

the Appellant has omitted to add the prayers, "appeal be allowed and the judgment be set

13

aside", it does not disentitle him to maintain this appeal. It is open to him to have and

maintain the appeal because he has added a prayer/ "the plaintiff's action be dismissed".

Thus there is a form of relief that has been sought in the case and this is exactly what

Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code requires a pleader to do and the pleader

in this case has done just that/namely couching his relief in the form/"the plaintiff's

action be dismissed."

In an identical manner Inaya v. Fathima (2006)2 Sri L.R. 124 was also cited by

Counsel for the Plaintifr Respondent. The Court of Appeal held in that case that in

the absence of a prayer seeking leave to appeal from a specific order made by the

original court and without praying to set aside that order, one cannot seek a

declaration and a direction to be given to the trial judge. The Counsel for the 2nd

Defendant/ Respondent in Inaya's case had taken up a preliminary objection that there

was no prayer for leave to appeal from any order or a prayer for setting aside any

order. In any event an application for leave to appeal must seek permission of Court of

Appeal for an order in terms of Section 753(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and that

plea was non/existent in Inaya v. Fathima (supra). It was in those circumstances that

the Court of Appeal rejected the application for leave to appeal.

In the instant appeal against a partition judgment from the District Court of

Balapitiya, a form of relief has been demanded and I have held that a precatory plea for

a dismissal of the plaintiff's action is within the four corners of the relief that is

contemplated within Section 758(1)(f) of the Civil Procedure Code. I have held that

this relief sought in the petition of appeal is capable of being awarded in terms of the

wide powers of the Court of Appeal bestowed on it by both the Civil Procedure Code

and the Constitution /see Section 773 of the Code and Articles 138 and 139(1) of the

Constitution.

I must also allude to the submissions made by Ms. MokshiniJayamanne. The learned

Counsel cited the case of lllangakoon Mudiyanselage Gnanathilaka Illangakoon v.

14

Anula KumarihamiS.C .H.C.C.A.LA 277/2011 (SC minutes of 05.04.2013). She placed

reliance on the following words of Sripavan J. (as His Lordship then was) in the case:~

"The plaintiff in paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition seeks to set aside the judgment of

the Court of Appeal when in fact no judgment was delivered by the Court of Appeal but by the

High Court of Central Province in Kandy."

Thus in that case the pleader committed the faux pas of praying for an annulment of a

judgment of the Court of Appeal when the judgment had in fact been delivered by the

Provincial High Court. It was this defect along with some other cardinal errors such

as non~compliance with Rules 28(2) and 28(5) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1990 that

eventuated in the dismissal of the application for leave to appeal in IUangakoon

Mudiyanselage Gnanathilaka Illangakoon v. Anula Kumarihami (supra). Sripavan,

J. (as His Lordship then was) also made some pertinent observations as to the

importance of applying the skill and diligence required of an Attorney~at~Law.

"I must emphasize that when accepting any professional matter from a client, it shall be the

duty of any attorney~adaw to exercise his skill with due diligence in drafting the necessary

papers with due regard to its duty to Court and to the client."

I must say that the degree of negligence that the Supreme Court found in the drafting

of the application for leave to appeal in that case, which resulted in the dismissal of

the application, is non~existent in this case. In the instant appeal before me it was

only an omission to add two more prayers namely~ "the appeal be allowed and the judgment

of the District Court be set aside" that is being complained of as vitiating the petition of

appeal. In my view these two remedies are subsumed in the relief that has been

sought~ "the plaintiff's action be dismissed". I would further expatiate on this later in the

judgment.

The Supreme Court in IUangakoon Mudiyanselage Gnanathilaka Illangakoon v.

Anula Kumarihamihad also followed the previous precedent of Sudath Rohana and

Another v. Mohamed Zeena and Another (2011) 2 Sri LR. 134; (2011) B.LR 277

15

-,

where Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J. (as Her Ladyship then was)

reiterated the importance of procedural law and cited with approval the pertinent

observations of His Lordship Dr. Amerasinghe, J. in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando

and others (1997) 3 Sri L.R. 1, wherein the learned Judge proclaimed:/

"Procedural law is not secondary; the two branches are complementary. When it is stated that

the substantive law and procedural law are complementary, it signifies the importance of

procedural law in a legal system. Whilst the substantive law lays down the rights, duties,

powers and liberties, the procedural law refers to the enforcement of such rights and duties. In

other words the procedural law breathes life into substantive law, sets it in motion, and

functions side by side with substantive law."

The combined effect of the respective arguments of Mr. Dharmaratne and Ms.

Jayamanne was that the petition of appeal is defective and it should be dismissed. Mr.

Dharmaratne also submitted that the plea "setting aside of the judgment of the District Court"

must have been prayed for, because he contended that it was the substantive relief in an

appeal, whilst the dismissal of the plaintiff's action is only incidental. Here the

Appellants have only asked for the incidental relief as they have only prayed for a

dismissal of the plaintiff's action without having asked for a setting aside of the

judgment dated 22.10.1999. This is the fatal flaw that infects the petition of appeal.

This was the argument of both Counsel for the Plaintiff/Respondent and the 26th

Defendant/ Respondent. The Counsel for the Appellants Mr. Marapana, PC quite

forcefully traversed the arguments on two frontal positions.

1. The objection was belated.

2. There was a relief that has been properly prayed for.

On the question of belated objection he argued that this is a case which was argued

thrice and after written submissions were filed by all parties, the hearing Judge had

fixed the matter for judgment but the judgment was not pronounced as the learned

Judge went into retirement thereafter. The PlaintifrRespondent had filed his written

16

# -,

submissions and at no stage had he taken up this objection. An objection that has not

been taken in time is deemed to be waived ~ so he argued. In Navaratnasingham v.

Arumugam and Another (1980) 2 Sri LR. lone finds this poignant observation.

"Where a matter is within the plenary jurisdiction of the Court, if no objection is taken, the

Court will then have jurisdiction to proceed and make a valid order. In the present case, the

objection to jurisdiction was raised for the first time when the matter was being argued in the

Court of Appeal and the objection had not even been taken in the petition filed before that

Court".

It was in this context that the learned President's Counsel Mr. Garnini Marapana, PC

cited the ever resonant words of Dr. Amerasinghe,]. in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando

and others (supra)

'Judges, do not blindly devote themselves to procedures or ruthlessly sacrifice litigants to

technicalities, although parties on the road to justice may choose to act recklessly."

This was in addition to his harking back to the analogy of Sydney Abraham, C] in

likening the usage of civil procedure like a juggernaut to throw a litigant out and run

over him leaving him maimed and lame.

It is axiomatic that a court should not be fettered by technical objections on matters

of procedure ~see Dias,J., in Podihamy v. Simon Appu47 N.LR 503 at 504; G.P.S. De

Silva, C.]., in Colgan and Others v. Udeshi and Others (1996) 2 Sri LR. 220. I take

the view that a defect in a petition of appeal, real or imaginary, cannot fetter and

shackle the appellate jurisdiction of this Court so as to frustrate the administration of

justice when this Court finds that the so called defect does not go to jurisdiction.

Be that as it may, it is his second argument that resonates with this Court and to

which Mr. Dharmaratne responded again in reply reiterating his argument that one

cannot ask for an incidental relief of dismissal without asking for a substantive relief of

setting aside a judgment.

17

The learned President's Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the assertion in

the petition ~ i.e., "It is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff's action be dismissed" is the final

relief which would result when the court sets aside the judgment and in order to

grant the final relief, this Court has to necessarily set aside the judgment of the

District Court.

In my view, one cannot be too legalistic and literalistic with the terms "substantive

rdief' and "incidental rdief'. What reliefs that this Court can grant upon the conclusion

of an appeal have already been set out by me, as is quite manifestly clear upon a

perusal of Section 773 of the cpe. This Court is statutorily enjoined to grant these

reliefs at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. Should the Appellant use the

appropriate words stipulated in the said provision? In my view, it is preferable that if

those words are used by pleaders. But what is the consequence that would ensue if

the pleader omits to couch his relief in the words found in the Section 773 of the CPC?

What if he does not use the commonplace phrase such as "the appeal be allowed"? Is it a

ground on which the petition of appeal must be dismissed? Both upon principle and

law I answer the question in the negative.

Section 759(2) of the CPC

I take the view that if there is clarity and no ambiguity as to the relief that an

Appellant is praying for, an insistence on a strict adherence to language is bound to

drive a coach and horses through the procedural enactment of Civil Procedure Code

which has curative provisions that go a long way to ensuring due process for parties.

In fact the better part of the argument before me was focused on Section 759(2) of the

CPC~the curative provision that excuses mistakes, omission or defect on the part of

any Appellant in complying with the provisions relating to appeals and Section

759(2) is a provision which vests a discretion in the Court of Appeal to grant relief to

an Appellant for his lapses prOvided the Respondent has not been materially

prejudiced.

In fact Mr. Anuruddha Dharmaratne argued that Section 759(2) cannot be applied in

the case of these Appellants who have not prayed for a relief, whilst Mr. Marapana,

PC contended that recourse to Section 759(2) does not arise as his Appellants have

prayed for a relief and they have not violated any provisions pertaining to the

procedure of appeals.

Allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment

After having given anxious consideration to the interesting arguments placed before

me, I must observe as I have done in this judgment that there is a clear enough prayer

that leaves no room for ambiguity. When the Appellants have pleaded that the

plaintiff's action must be dismissed, the dismissal encompasses the process of

"allowing the appeal" and "setting aside the judgment".

The final destination of dismissal of the plaintiff's action cannot be reached without

passing the signposts of allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment. In any

event Section 773 of the CPC statutorily enjoins this Court to reverse any judgment

according to law and this reversal necessarily entails the final result of diSmissing the

action of the plaintiff's action. The relief sought - Le., dismissal of the plaintiff's action

admits of no doubt as to what the Appellants have sought in this appeal and before

this relief is granted, this Court has to do one of the constituent acts of Section 773

such as reversing the judgment to grant the relief that the Appellants have specifically

sought in the petition of appeal.

One cannot put labels such as substantive relief and incidental relief on the remedies that

this Court is empowered to grant namely an Appellant must use particular formulae

in petitions of appeal (setting aside a judgment etc.,) and in default of such language

being used, the Appellant must suffer the consequence of dismissal of his petition of

appeal.

The Twelve Tables and Formalism of Roman Judges

This is reminiscent of Roman Judges who insisted on formalism in pleadings. In

Roman law, the Twelve Tables introduced an action against anyone who secretly cut

19

-..

.. ' . down trees belonging to another's property. The action was known as actio arborum

furtim caesarum. The fixed penalty of 25 asses for each tree was later changed to double

value by the Praetorian action actio de arboribus succicis. So if one wished to sue a

wrongdoer for cutting down trees, he had to use the exact form of words ~actio de

arboribus succicis. Gaius in his Institutes 4.11 attests to the odiously technical view

Roman Judges took of the form of the action. It so happened that one wanted to sue

another for cutting down his vines. The Roman Judges were so formalistic that a man

who, in suing for the cutting down of his vines, used the word "vines" lost his case; he

ought to have used the word "trees" (arboribus). Though later this action was extended

by interpretation to the case of "vites succisae" (the cutting down of vines), the Plaintiff

was still bound to state the case in the terms of the original rule "de arboribus succicis"

only and any omission or variation in the prescribed form nullified the action. Once

the pleadings were filed, it could not be retracted, repeated or amended, and it

completely extinguished the party's statutory right of action. So in Roman law the

exact verba legiS (the letter of the law) should be employed.

We cannot act a la the RomanJudges, because our civil procedure does not require us

to make a fetish of the written word. That is why the words such as "allow the

appeal" are used quite liberally in a prayer even though this exact collocation of

words is nowhere found in the Civil Procedure Code. It is non~existent in Section 773

of the cpc. The liberality shown towards drafting in our procedure, provided what

the Appellant seeks is plain as a pikestaff, is in total contrast to the uncompromising

literalism shown by Roman Judges and I am not inclined to dismiss this petition of

appeal merely because it does not contain two additional prayers namely "appeal be

allowed" and ')udgment of the District Court be set aside". In my view they are subsumed in

the relief that has been sought~ "the plaintiff's action be dismissed" though this plea is,

more often than not, found in plaints ~see the Latin maxim Omne majus continet in se

minus (the greater includes the lesser). But that plea in the petition of appeal under

20

impugnation brings home what the Appellants want this Court to do provided it is

permissible in law.

Before I part with this judgment I would like to make a few general observations.

Non-compliance with any procedural enactment relating to a pleading should not

entail automatic dismissal or rejection and irregularities which are curable should not

be allowed to defeat substantive rights or to cause injustice. Our Civil Procedure

Code teems with curative provisions to undo irregularities and I do not deem it

necessary to resort to Section 759(2) of the CPC as I find that the plea "the plaintiff's

action be dismissed" is a relief that has been demanded of this Court and it is within the

plenary jurisdiction of this Court to grant such relief in appeal.

Procedure, a handmaiden to justice, should never be made a tool to deny justice or

perpetuate injustice, by any oppressive or punitive use.

A code of procedure is a body of law designed to facilitate justice and further its ends,

and should not be treated as an enactment providing for sanctions and penalties. Ubi

jus ibi remedium (where there is a right, there is a remedy) is a principle that is

ingrained in our legal system and this Court is invested with the widest possible

discretion to see that proceedings that affect lives and property must continue in the

presence of parties and they should not be precluded from participating in them

owing to linguistic paucity imaginarily perceived in their pleadings.

So I would overrule the preliminary objections to the maintainability of this appeal

and proceed to order that the argument on the merits is set down for hearing.
