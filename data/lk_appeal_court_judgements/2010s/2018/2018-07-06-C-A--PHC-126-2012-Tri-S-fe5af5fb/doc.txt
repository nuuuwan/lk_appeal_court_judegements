The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a notice under section 46 (3)

of the Wages Boards Ordinance on the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) calling upon it to pay

Rs. 111,096,0/= as wages of its employees before 2006-07-19. The said

notice has been produced in the Provincial High Court marked e:> 4.

Thereafter, as the Appellant did not comply with the said direction, the 1st

Respondent had instituted proceedings in the Magistrate's Court by filing a

4

certificate in terms of section 3 D of the Wages Boards Ordinance to

recover the said sum of money from the Appellant.

The position taken up by the Appellant before the Magistrate's Court is that

a part of the amount of money referred to in the certificate relevant to this

case had already been paid to the employees. The Appellant has relied on

copies of some cheques to attempt to prove that the said part of the

relevant payment has been made by it. It is to be noted that the Appellant

had merely produced this documents along with his written submission

before the learned Magistrate. Therefore, at the very outset it must be

observed that the Appellant has failed to legally adduce any evidence to

satisfy Court that such payment has duly been made. This is because no

responsible officer or for that matter no person has taken the responsibility

of the impugned assertion that a part of money due has been paid. The 1st

Respondent on the other hand had challenged the genuineness of the said

document produced by the Appellant.

Learned Magistrate having considered the material so placed before him,

being not satisfied with the Petitioner's position, by his order dated 2009-

04-24, had ordered that the said amount of money be recovered as a fine

and ordered the Appellant to pay the total sum of money referred to in the

5

certificate. He has also imposed a term of imprisonment of 12 months RI in

the event of its failure to pay the said sum of money. This sentence has

been imposed on the directors of Appellant company.

The Appellant thereafter had filed an application for revision in the

Provincial High Court of Colombo seeking a revision of the order made by

the learned Magistrate.

The position taken up by the Appellant before the Provincial High Court is

that the relevant certificate has been signed by the Acting Deputy

Commissioner of Labour and that he had no authority to sign the certificate

and that such power only lies with the Commissioner of Labour under

section 3 (D)(2) of the Wages Boards Ordinance.

The Provincial High Court after considering the material had dismissed the

application holding inter alia;

i. that the Appellant had failed to establish that a part of the sum of

money set out in the certificate has been paid,

ii. that the documents relied upon by the Appellant to prove the above

position cannot be accepted,

6

iii. that the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Labor is a competent person

to issue the relevant certificate under section 3(0)(2) in terms of

section 53 of the Act which has empowered the Commissioner of

Labour to generally or specially authorize any Deputy Commissioner

or any person appOinted under section 52 to exercise, perform or

discharge any power, duty or function of the Commissioner under

this Ordinance,

iv. that the said objection had not been raised by the Appellant before

the learned Magistrate.

The Appellants in the course of the proceedings before this Court,

restricted its argument only to one ground of appeal. The said ground is

that the Appellant has already paid a substantial part of the money payable

and that they are not liable to pay the full sum of money (i.e Rs. 1.1

Million) sought to be recovered through the certificate filed by the

Commissioner of Labour.

As has been pointed out by the learned State Counsel the Respondent has

written to the Appellant calling upon it to pay the said sum in default by

the letter dated 2006-06-26. This document has been annexed as E) 1 to

7

the statement of objections filed in the Provincial High Court in the revision

application filed before it. In response to that letter, the Appellant had

replied by the letter dated July 2006 (annexed to the statement of

objection filed in the High Court in the revision application as t> 2),

claiming that a substantial sum of money has already been paid. Then the

Commissioner of Labour replying to the said letter by the Appellant, called

upon the Appellant to substantiate the position that it had paid a part of

the dues. However, the Appellant had chosen not to reply to the said

letter. It was thereafter, on 2006-07-19, that the 1st Respondent had

issued a notice under section 46 (3) of the Act.

It is the position of the Appellant that the payment it claims to have been

made had been made by cheque numbers 536253, 156258, 536254,

536261, 536259, 536256, 536260, 536257. (The Appellant has set out the

details of these cheques in his written submissions filed before this Court

also.)

However, as has been pOinted out by the learned State Counsel this Court

observes that the above cheques are dated in the foliowiAg manner.

CHEQUE NO. DATE OF THE CHEQUE

1. 536253 2008-05-28

2. 156258 2008-06-26

3. 536254 2008-05-28

4. 536261 2008-06-26

5. 536259 2008-06-26

6. 536256 2008-05-28

7. 536260 2008-06-26

8. 536257 2008-05-28

When considering the above facts, it is not possible for this Court to see

any basis to disagree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge in his order dated 2012-05-24.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to affirm the said order and

dismiss this appeal.

9

This Court notes that the 1st Respondent had written to the Appellant to

pay this amount of money which is wages due to its employees, in as far

back as in 2006. By way of a frivolous revision application and an appeal

the Appellant has resorted to delaying tacticts. In these circumstances, this

Court directs the Appellant to pay a state cost of Rs. 50,000 (payable by

the Appellant to the state).
