A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j,

Defendant~ Appellant absent and unrepresented

P. Peramunagama with Pushpika Peiris for the Plaintif~Respondent.

24.03.2016

The Plaintif~ Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action on 18.03.1994 against the Defendant~Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") for a declaration of title to the land which

is morefully described in the schedule to the plaint, for ejectment of the Defendant,

his agent and all those who claim under him, and for damages and costs.

Denying all averments stated by the Plaintiff, the Defendant filed his answer on

29.08.1994 and stated that since 1973 he had been in possession of the land in

dispute and he secured the right to be in possession of the said land from one

Punchirala, who had obtained from him a sum of Rs.5,000/~ on the promise that he

would get a permit from the Government in defendant's name. He further said in

his answer that though Punchirala is now dead, the Defendant has been in

possession of the land over 20 years and he has obtained prescriptive title to the said

land.

When the case was taken up for trial on 10.02.1997, the Plaintiff raised Nos. 1 to 11

issues and the Defendant raised 12 to 20 issues. A consequential issue No. 21 was

also raised by the Plaintiff on the defendant's predecessor Punchirale's title. When

the trial commenced, the Plaintiff and one Dingiri Banda testified on behalf of the

Plaintiff and on behalf of the Defendant, the Defendant and one Herath Banda gave

2

..

evidence. Thereafter the parties closed their cases. The learned Additional District

judge delivered his Judgment on 07.04.2000 in favour of the Plaintiff.

This appeal is filed by the Defendant against the judgment entered in this case. After

filing of the petition of appeal, the Defendant has not taken any steps to prosecute

the appeal.

This is a rei vindicatio action filed by the Plaintiff against the Defendant, who was in

possession of the land in dispute. In an action like this, it is the responsibility of the

Plaintiff to prove his title to the satisfaction of the Court. Incidentally, it must be

noted that the Defendant had been placed in possession of the land, consequent to a

Magistrate Court's case in Nikaweratiya namely Case No. 27406, and the Plaintiff

was directed to file a civil action to prove his title to the said land.

According to the evidence of the Plaintiff, originally the land belonged to the State

and by a Crown Grant (the date thereof does not seem to be clear) PI, one Ran

Menika became the Grantee of the land, who by Deed of Transfer No. 15188 dated

13.09.1957 marked P2 transferred the land to one Ukku Bandage Punchirala. After

his death, his children Somawathie, Dingiri Banda and Ukku Banda became entitled

to the said land. These three persons by Deed No. 1678 dated 16.12.1993 marked P3

sold and transferred the said land to the Plaintiff, who thus became entitled to the

same. Thus the plaintiff's title goes back to the crown grant which is admittedly

over several years.

According to paragraph 8 of the plaint, the dispute had arisen only on 03.01.1994

when the Defendant forcibly entered into the land by cutting the barbed wire fence,

which averment the Defendant denies. His position is that since 1973, he has been in

possession of the land and has been cultivating vegetables and the said Punchirala

received Rs.5,OOO/~ from him to transfer all his rights to the Defendant. But the

Defendant has failed to prove his possession and prescriptive title over ten years.

Although the Defendant stated in his answer and raised issue to the effect that since

1973 he had been cultivating vegetables in the land in dispute, yet in his evidence he

has shifted his position and given unsatisfactory evidence. The learned Trial Judge

has commented on this in his judgment at pages 6 and 7. In short, it is clear that the

Defendant has not given cogent evidence to prove his possession of the land.

The learned Additional District Judge at page 5 of his judgment states that he was

satisfied that the Plaintiff has proved his legal title without any contradiction, and

at page 6 he further says that the Defendant was not entitled to prescriptive title.

One of the persons who sold the land to the Plaintiff is Dingiri Banda, who in his

evidence states that when they sold the land in 1993 to the Plaintiff there was no one

living on the land and the Defendant was living on a land closer to the land in

dispute and the Defendant had never possessed this land.

In Siyaneris v. De SUva 52 N.L.R. 289, it was held that in an action for declaration

of title to property, where the legal title is in the Plaintiff but the property is in the

possession of the Defendant, the burden of proof is on the Defendant. If a person

goes into possession of a land as agent of another, the Privy Council held that

prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is holding

adversely to his principal.

The learned Trial Judge has analyzed the evidence given on behalf of the Plaintiff

and the Defendant (oral and documentary) and come to a correct conclusion that

defendant's prescriptive possession has not been proved and that the Plaintiff has

proved his title to the land morefully described in schedule to the plaint, and

therefore the Plaintiff is entitled to an order for ejectment of the Defendant and his

agents and servants therefrom and to get vacant possession of the said land. I am of

the considered view that this conclusion is correct and I am of the view that I would

not disturb the judgment of the learned District Judge.

Once a Trial Judge comes to a finding on the facts relating to the rights of the parties

the case must be decided in accordance with such finding. In the instant case,

therefore, when the learned Trial Judge came to the conclusion that Defendant was

4

not in possession of the land in 1993 and that he has disbelieved the Defendant on

the question of prescriptive possession, that conclusion must be allowed to stand.

In the circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment and decree

entered in this case. I accordingly dismiss the appeal without costs.
