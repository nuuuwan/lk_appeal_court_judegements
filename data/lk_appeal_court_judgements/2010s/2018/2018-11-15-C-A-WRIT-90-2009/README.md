Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 26th June 2018, the learned

Counsel appearing for all Parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment

on the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties. While

written submissions have been tendered on behalf of the Petitioners and the

1st and 2nd Respondents, the Attorney-at-Law for the 3rd Respondent has

informed this Court by a motion dated 31st August 2018 that written

submissions would not be tendered on behalf of the 3rd Respondent as no

relief has been prayed against the 3rd Respondent.

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the Notices of Assessments issued to the 1st Petitioner by the 1st Respondent

Minuwangoda Pradeshiya Sabha. The said notices have been annexed to the

petition marked 'P4' and 'PS'.

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act No.7 of

2007. The 2nd Petitioner states that he is the Chairman and Managing Director

of the 1st Petitioner. The Petitioners' claim that the Board of Investment of Sri

Lanka has granted approval to the 1st Petitioner to engage in a project to

assemble motor vehicles and that the total value of the project is Rs. 500

million. The Petitioners claim further that the 1st Petitioner has secured from

the Ministry of Enterprise Development, Industrial Policy and Investment

Promotion, a land in extent of approximately 2 acres, on a SO year lease. This

Court observes that the Petitioners have not submitted any documents to

3

1 1 I i

~

establish that the 1st Petitioner had received approval from the Board of

Investment nor has a copy of the lease agreement been submitted with the

petition.

The Petitioners state that the said land is situated within the Japalawatte

Industrial Estate, Minuwangoda, within the administrative limits of the 1st

Respondent. The Petitioners state further that the 1st Respondent had issued

the 1st Petitioner a Notice of Assessment! dated 1st October 2008 in terms of

Section 141(3) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 in respect of the

aforementioned land. A copy of the said Notice of Assessment has been

annexed to the petition, marked 'p4'. The 1st Petitioner had been informed by

'p4' that the annual value of the said land had been assessed at Rs.

17,850,0002 and that the rates payable per quarter is Rs. 35,700, which is 8% of

the annual value. The 1st Petitioner, by a letter dated 21st October 2008,

annexed to the petition marked 'PS', had objected to the said assessment on

the following basis:

a) The said land belongs to the State and therefore is not subject to rates3;

b) The assessment is excessive and arbitrary;

c) No reasons have been adduced.

l~~t~~

2 The 1st Respondent states that the value should have read as '1,785,000'.

3 The Petitioners have not pursued with this objection, probably in view of the provisions of Section 136 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, which reads as follows: "All houses, buildings, lands and tenements within the limits of any Pradeshiya Sabha belonging to the State and leased or let by the State to any person, shall be liable to be assessed in respect of the rate or rates ..... Ieviable under section 134 and every lessee or occupier of any such premises shall be liable to pay, and shall pay to the Pradeshiya Sabha, the rate or rates ...... Ieviable in respect of the house, building, land or tenement so held or occupied."

4

In response to 'PS', by a letter dated 25th November 20084, the 1st Respondent

had requested the 1st Petitioner to be present at an inquiry scheduled for 1st

December 2008, in order to consider the objections raised by the Petitioners.

The Petitioners state that at the inquiry held on 1st December 2008 with the

participation of the 2nd Petitioner and the officials of the Valuation

Department, they took up the position that rates cannot be imposed as no

services are being provided by the 1st Respondent to the 1 stpetitioner, that no

reasons have been adduced for the sudden imposition of rates and that in any

event, the quantum of the assessment was excessive.

Bya letter dated 5th December 20085 sent after the inquiry, the Petitioners had

stated further inter alia that imposition of rates is arbitrary and unreasonable

for the following reasons:

a) No services are provided by the Pradeshiya Sabha which therefore has no

moral right to impose rates;

b) No reasons have been set out for the sudden imposition of rates from

October 2008;

c) In any event, the quantum of rates assessed is excessive in view of the

locality and neighbourhood;

d) The 1st Petitioner, the other investors and the Ministry of Industries have

not been consulted prior to the imposition of rates.

4A copy of the said letter has been annexed to the petition, marked 'PG',

5 This letter has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P7',

5

Thus, it is apparent that the gravamen of the complaint of the Petitioners was

that the 1st Respondent had no right to charge rates as no services were being

provided to the 1st Petitioner and that the sudden imposition of rates in 2008,

without affording the Petitioners a hearing and without adducing any reasons

for such imposition, was arbitrary and unreasonable.

By a revised Notice of Assessment dated 22nd December 2008, annexed to the

petition marked 'PS', the 1st Respondent had informed the 1st Petitioner that

the annual value had been revised to Rs. 1,511,111 and that the rates payable

for each quarter had been reduced to Rs. 30,222, which is 8% of the annual

value.

The Petitioners have invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court, seeking a Writ

of Certiorari to quash the Notices of Assessment marked 'p4' and 'PS', inter

alia on the following grounds:

a) The assessments 'p4' and 'PS' are totally without jurisdiction and

unsupported by evidence;

b) No reasons have been furnished for the issuing of the assessment;

c) In any event, the quantum of rates is manifestly excessive in view of the

locality of the land and in view of the fact that no services are rendered by

the 1st Respondent;

d) The assessment offends the principles of proportionality.

The basis of the Petitioners' case before this Court therefore was that the

sudden imposition of rates is unreasonable as no services are being provided

by the 1st Respondent. This is similar to what was set out in 'P7' referred to

earlier. The Petitioners have not complained to this Court about the basis of

the valuation applied by the 3rd Respondent.

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioners, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners has strenuously taken up the position that no

reasons have been adduced by the 1st Respondent for the said assessments

and that in any event, the quantum of rates is manifestly excessive. The

learned Counsel has also cited the judgment of this Court in Gunewardena vs

The Colombo Municipal Council and others6 where it was held that in order to

effectively challenge and canvass the decision of the Municipal Council, the

assessee must be informed of the reasons for the increase in the quantum of

rates.

The Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 contains several provisions relating to

the imposition of rates. The power of a Pradeshiya Sabha to impose rates is

contained in Section 134{1} of the Act, which reads as follows:

"Every Pradeshiya Sabha may, subject to the approval of the Minister,

impose and levy a rate on the annual value of any immovable property or

any species of immovable property situated in localities declared by the

Pradeshiya Sabha, with the approval of the Assistant Commissioner to be

'built up localities7'.

I f:

The 3rd Respondent has submitted to this Court, marked '3Rl', a copy of the

notification by which the 1st Respondent had declared the area within which

the aforementioned land is situated as a 'built up locality'. It is only upon a

determination being made that a particular area is a 'built up locality' can the

Pradeshiya Sabha impose rates. Thus, the decision of the 1st Respondent to

charge rates from the 1st Petitioner is within the provisions of the said Act.

The Petitioners appear to be under a misapprehension that the levying of rates

is directly attributable to the provision of services by a local council. This Court

observes that the Act does not draw a direct nexus between the provision of

services by a Pradeshiya Sabha and the charging of rates. It is common ground

that a person living within the administrative limits of any local council area is

provided common amenities and services such as public roads, street lighting,

garbage disposal, medical clinics, burial grounds etc. The finances necessary for

the provision of such services may not be provided entirely by the Central

Government and hence, a local council should have the right to collect rates

from persons and entities resident or carrying on business within their

administrative boundaries. The fact that the land leased by the 1st Petitioner is

situated within an industrial estate and that services within that estate are

paid for by the members of that industrial estate, does not exempt such

persons from paying rates for the services that may be provided by the 1st

Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha. Furthermore, the quantum of rates chargeable

has no nexus to the scope of the services or the quality of the services that

may be provided by a local council, as long as the determination of the

quantum is not arbitrary, unreasonable or disproportionate. Thus, this Court is

of the view that the 1st Petitioner is liable to pay rates to the 1st Respondent

8

Pradeshiya Sabha in respect of the land that it has leased in the said industrial

estate.

Once a determination is made in terms of Section 134{1} of the Act, the next

step required in terms of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act is to assess the annual

value of the properties in question. Provision in this regard is found in Section

140{1} of the Act, which reads as follows:

"For the preparation of a new assessment, the annual value of each

house, building land and tenement within the limits of any Pradeshiya

Sabha shall be assessed by the Chief Valuer or any person or persons

approved by the Pradeshiya Sabha with the approval of the Assistant

Commissioner."

Thus, the determination of the annual value is not made by the Pradeshiya

Sabha but by the Chief Valuer, who not only has expertise in the valuation of

land but is independent of the 1st Respondent. Furthermore, the Chief Valuer

would have to abide by the principles relating to valuation, which would

ensure that arbitrary valuations are not imposed. The 3rd Respondent Chief

Valuer has stated in the Objections filed in this Court that the initial annual

valuation reflected in 'p4' was determined by the 3rd Respondent and that the

annual value has been correctly assessed by the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd

Respondent has also stated that, 'the valuation is made having regard to the

principles and tenets of rating valuation and the applicable provisions of the

Act'. The 1st Respondent has also stated that the said assessments are

computed based on principles of valuation. This Court observes that the

Petitioners have not denied this position of the Respondents in their counter

9

affidavits nor presented any material to contradict the annual value given by

the 3rd Respondent.

In terms of Section 141(3) of the Act, the Notice of Assessment must specify

that written objections to the assessment will be received at the Pradeshiya

Sabha office, within thirty days from the date of service of the notice. Any

objections received shall be recorded on a book maintained by the Pradeshiya

Sabha and the person objecting shall be informed of the place and the time at

which the objections will be investigated. Section 141(6) provides that once

any objection to an assessment is investigated and disposed of, the Pradeshiya

Sabha shall cause the decision thereon to be notified to the objector, and for

such decision to be noted in the book of objections, and for any necessary

amendment to be made in the assessment list.

There is no dispute between the parties that the above procedure was

followed by the 1st Respondent and that the 1st Petitioner was duly afforded an

opportunity of presenting its objections. The amendment of the annual value

to Rs. 1,511,111 too has been carried out by the 3rd Respondent, taking into

consideration the representations made by the Petitioners.

This Court must observe that the 1st Respondent has followed the procedure

laid down in the Act when determining the rates payable by the Petitioner and

to that extent, the decision of the 1st Respondent to issue 'P4' and 'PS' is

neither illegal nor arbitrary.

The Petitioners' complaint to this Court is that there was no legal basis to issue

an assessment to pay rates and that reasons have not been adduced as to why

10

1

an assessment had been issued. This Court has already expressed the view that

the 1st Respondent has the legal authority to issue a notice of assessment

requesting the 1st Petitioner to pay rates. This Court is of the view that in doing

so, the 1st Respondent is not required in law to provide any justification or

reasons as to why an assessment is being issued or as to why the 1st Petitioner

has to pay rates.

This Court observes that the Petitioners have not challenged the basis of the

valuation. This becomes significant in the context of the Respondents' position

that the valuation has been done according to the principles and tenets of

rating valuation.

While it is not practical for a local council to inform each and every

householder the basis on which the initial annual value has been determined

or the basis on which the annual value has subsequently been amended, this

Court is of the view that the valuation must be determined on a rational basis

and such determination must be available with the Pradeshiya Sabha to be

made available, if requested, to an assessee. This is especially so because the

Act provides an assessee dissatisfied with an assessment an opportunity of

objecting to the assessment. This Court must observe that the Petitioners in

this case have not requested the Respondents to submit the basis of the

valuation. However, if such a request is made, the 1st Respondent is under a

legal duty to provide the necessary material.

The Petitioners have cited the judgment of this Court in Gunawardena8 in

support of its argument that reasons must be given for the assessment. In that

8 Supra.

11

case, the Municipal Council had assessed the annual value of the first property

at Rs. 5000, in 1989. In 1991, this had been increased to Rs. 34,200 and in

1995, it had been increased to Rs. 144,000, but after objections, reduced to Rs.

120,000. With regard to the second property, the Municipal Council had

assessed the annual value at Rs. 6000, in 1989. In 1991, this had been

increased to Rs. 32,400 and in 1995, it had been increased to Rs. 134,400 but

after objections, reduced to Rs. 96,000. Court observed that no reasons had

been given by the Municipal Council for the increase of the annual value of the

first property by 24 times and 16 times in respect of the second property. The

Court also found it difficult to fathom how a property initially valued at Rs.

5000, was subsequently valued higher than a property which was initially

valued at Rs. 6000. The situation was compounded by the failure of the

Municipal Council to explain the increase, even to Court. It is in this context

that this Court held that there is no rationality with regard to the assessment,

which when challenged required an explanation be provided for the

extraordinary increase and the sudden change. The situation that has arisen in

this application is different to that in Gunawardena and as stated earlier, the

basis of the valuation has not been put in issue by the Petitioners before this

Court or previously.

In these circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue Writs of

Certiorari to quash the Notices of Assessment marked 'P4' and 'pg'. The

application of the Petitioners is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
