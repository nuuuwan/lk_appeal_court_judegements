M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This refers to an appeal stemming from the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Matale in respect of a Declaration of title and the

possession to the land in action, bearing case Number 4872/L.

Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent")

filed this action to have that specific Deed of Gift No. 4510, dated

18.02.1986 attested by U. I Wijeyathilake, Notary Public been

revoked by Deed No. 8117 attested by the same U. I Wijeyathilake,

Notary Public on 09.09.1994 and vacate the Defendants-Appellants

(hereinafter referred to as the "Appellants") from the premises and

declare the title to the land and its possession to him, also claimed

compensation from the Appellants.

The learned District Judge on 30.07.1999 delivered the judgment in

favour of the Respondent as prayed for in the Plaint (page 56-65 of

the appeal brief).

Being aggrieved with the said judgment of the learned District Judge,

the Appellants preferred this appeal and prayed to set aside the

2

judgment of the learned District Judge and to make an order to call

for a fresh trial.

In the District Court, the Respondent pleaded that under the Partition

action No. 749/P (in the District Court of Matale) he had received the

premises in dispute and wilfully had gifted the specific premises to

the both Appellants by way of Deed of Gift No. 4510, dated

18.02.1986 (as mentioned above) marked as "P1" and he further

mentioned the following conditions were included that:

1. The life interest vested is to the Respondent

2. Respondent have the right to revoke the Deed of Gift when he

desires.

Further he pleaded that on 09.09.1994 by Deed No. 8117 attested by

the same U. I Wejethilake, Notary Public revoked the above

mentioned Deed of Gift No. 4510 and he has sent a notice to the

Appellants through his Attorney-at-Law informing that the Deed of

Gift No. 4510 had been revoked; and the said notice had been

received by the Appellants.

Further on 01.01.1995, the Respondent had asked them to pay

RS.5001- monthly as rental for the specific premises and asked them

to vacate but, the Appellants refused to vacate and also denied to

pay monthly rental of RS.5001. Then the Respondent persuaded this

action before the learned District Judge of Matale.

The Appellants argued that the Respondent only wilfully gifted the

specific premises to them and they are unaware of the revocation

made by the Respondent and also there were no proper reason to

3

revoke the Deed of Gift No. 4510 and this could be suppressed the

rights over the property.

Further they had pleaded that they have spent lot of money to

improve the premises and quoted as follows:

In the year of 1979 due to heavy storm the premises had been

severely damaged, they rebuilt the house and for the improvements

they have taken a loan amount of RS.50001- from National Housing

Scheme Office and still (1999s) they are liable to pay loan.

The 1st Defendant-Appellant claimed that she had faced 38721L and

38791L cases in order to obtain the right of way to the specific

property.

Further the 1st Defendant-Appel/ant claimed that she had spent

RS.50001- to dug a well in the premises and she had built a toilet and

took steps to get the electricity connection to the specific property.

The Appellants also pleaded that they are the two who possessed the

premises for a long period of time.

It is to be noted that the Respondent had properly revoked the Deed

of Gift No. 4510 through Deed No. 8117 attested by U. I

Wijeyathilake, Notary Public on 09.09.1994 and sent notice about the

revocation to the Appellants and all the evidence led by the

Respondent and been proved before the learned District Judge.

4

The learned District Judge approached in proper manner that the

revocation is valid and the clause of revocation clearly stated that in

Deed of Gift No. 4510 attested by the same Notary Public.

I am incline to accept the view of the learned District Judge that,

although the Appellants had stated that many improvements done by

them such as rebuilding the house after the said catastrophe, digging

the well, building a toilet, obtaining right of way through facing cases

and getting power supply but the important point to be noted that they

have not submitted at least a single evidence, therefore, they failed to

prove their all claims for the improvements.

The Appellants also averred that they have possessed the premises

for a long time. According to the provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance Act, No 2 of 1889 the claimant must prove the

following elements:-

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to independent or adverse to the claimant and

3. Then (10) years previous to the bringing of such action.

[Vide CHELLIAH vs. WIJENA THAN [54 NLR 337J, SIRAJUDEEN AND

TWO OTHERS vs. ABBAS [(1994) 2 SLR 365JJ

In this issue the Appellants prescriptive period had started on 1986 (by

Deed of Gift No. 4510) and ended on 1994 (by Deed No. 8117) and

which is lesser than 10 years according to Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance and it is clear that the Appellants cannot claim prescriptive

title.

, I further observed that the monthly rental of Rs.SOO/- claimed by the

Respondent is a reasonable prayer; and I hold that the Appellants are

liable to pay the rentals up to the date.

For the foregoing reasons, I affirm the judgment of the learned District

Judge and dismiss the appeal with Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
