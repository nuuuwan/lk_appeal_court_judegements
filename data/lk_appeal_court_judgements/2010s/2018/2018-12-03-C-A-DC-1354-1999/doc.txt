The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent")

instituted this action against the 151 to 3rd Defendants above named seeking

for a declaration of title to the property more fully described in the amended

plaint dated 11.02.1997.

In the District Court, the Respondent in his plaint pleaded inter alia that the

land in suit depicted in Plan bearing No. 1489 dated 18.06.1996 prepared by

A. Samararathne, License Surveyor and set out his chain of title thereto

emanating from one Halgoda Endirige Karlina who had acquired title to the

land in suit by a final decree of a partition action (instituted in the District Court

of Galle, bearing No. 11782) which is also depicted as Lot 1 and Lot 2 in the

final Partition Plan bearing No. 304A dated 27.01.1914 and 02.07.1914 which

is now superimposed by the above mentioned plan and the Defendants had

come to the possession of Lot C depicted in the said superimposed Plan

forcibly on or about 10.04.1995.

4

The Defendants had filed their joint answer denying all and singular the

several averments contained in the amended plaint (page 35 of the appeal

brief) and stated inter alia that one P. K Karolis and P. G. Sendiris Appuhami

were the original owners of Lot 4 and 5 depicted in Plan 304A who had

acquired title to the said allotments by the final decree of the said partition

action and over the course of time their title to the said lots were conveyed to

the Defendants through series of deeds and inheritance and is now depicted

as one land in the Plan bearing No. 543 dated 24.08.1997 prepared by L. S.

Dahanayake, Licensed Surveyor. The Defendants also stated that the

Respondent had narrowed 8 feet cart road to 2 feet road the situated along

the Eastern and Western boundaries of the lands of the Defendants and

Respondent, which they used as a common road to their land for a long

period of time and prayed for a dismissal of the Respondent's action, a

declaration of title to the allotments of the land depicted Plan No. 543.

With all the above mentioned averments the case was fixed for trial by the

learned Trial Judge and the case proceeded to trial on several issues raised

on behalf of the contesting parties.

When this case was taken up for trial on 04.05.1999, the Respondent and the

3rd Defendant, who were present in the Court, moved the Court to settle the

matter and said terms of settlement were recorded in open Court as agreed

upon by the parties and the learned Trial Judge fixed the case for site

inspection (vide page 61 & 62 of the appeal brief - said agreement and the

terms of the settlement).

Subsequently the 151 and 2nd Defendants made an application to the Court

seeking to set aside the said settlement entered into between the Respondent

and the 3rd Defendant in the absence of the 151 and 2nd Defendants and hence

the said settlement is not a valid settlement according to the law.

Attorney-at-Law for the Respondent making submissions stated that:

At the inquiry, the 1st and 2nd Defendants stated that they were not present in

Court on that fateful day due to illness of the 2nd Defendant and that they did

not take part in the settlement. They further stated that both Defendants never

instructed their Attorney-at-Law to come to a settlement of the above

mentioned nature.

After hearing the submissions of both the parties, the learned District Judge

made an order (dated 30.07.1999) refusing the application of the 1st and 2nd

Defendants on the basis that the District Court has no power to set aside a

settlement entered into between parties who were appropriately represented

by their respective Attorneys in Court and fixed a date again for the site

inspection (page 70 of the brief). Accordingly the said site inspection was

6

carried out by the learned District Judge on 29.10.1999 and after the

inspection the learned Judge fixed the case for order.

The said order was delivered on 26.11.1999 granting a 4 feet broad access

road to the Defendants along the Northern and Western boundaries of the

Respondent's land as agreed by the parties to the settlement and affirmed the

terms of settlement entered into between the Respondent and the

Defendants.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 26.11.1999, the 151 and 2nd

Defendant-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellants")

have preferred this appeal to seeking set aside the said order and this appeal

had been objected by the Respondent in the District Court on the basis that

the Appellants have no right of appeal against an order made affirming a

settlement. Even though, the learned District Judge overruled the objection of

the Respondent and ordered the case record to send to this Court.

Accordingly, when the instant appeal was taken up for hearing, the

Respondent raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this

appeal on the basis that there is no right of appeal to the Appellants as they

have appealed against an order made affirming the settlement entered into

between the parties in the District Court (vide journal entry dated 29.03.2016

(CA))

In this appeal, the Appellants' main averment was that they were not present

on Court on that fateful day due to an unavoidable circumstance as the 2nd

Defendant was ill; and they are further stated that they never instructed their

Registered Attorney to come to settlement (as mentioned in page 61 & 62 of

the appeal brief), which is highly prejudicial to their right, 3rd Defendant who

entered in to the settlement between the Respondent is not a party highly

prejudicial to his right.

7

In contrast, the Respondent's submission was that the 151 to 3rd Defendants

were represented by the same Registered Attorney in the District Court from

very inception until the settlement and that they have filed a joint answer and

therefore it is clearly evident that the Defendants were acting in cooperation

with each other and their interest were the same and that they had granted

the authority to their Registered Attorney to take all the necessary steps in the

Court on behalf of them by the proxy (para 15 of the Respondent's written

submission dated 01.06.2018).

Therefore, Counsel for the Respondent rely on the decisions of SINNA

VELOO vs. MESSERS LIPTON LTD. [(1963) 66 NLR 214] and CHARLES

PERERA vs. SHANTHA GUNASEKARA [CA 2044/2001] and submitted that

the views set out by these case law in respect of the settlement entered by an

Attorney-at-Law in the absence of his client is that such settlement cannot be

assailed on the ground of the absence of such party as the Registered

Attorney as regarded as acting under the authority of such party granted by a

proxy.

In this segment, it is important to note that the pronouncement of GARGIAL et

al. vs. SOMASUNDARAM CHETTY, [09 NLR 26], in this case the Defendant

was absent at the trial stage. The proctor moved for a postponement since

the Defendant was abroad. The judge refused a date. The court heard

evidence of the Plaintiff and entered judgment. The question arose in appeal

with the trial, whether it was ex parte or inter-partes. The Supreme Court (C.

P. Layard, C. J, and Wood Renton, J) held that it was inter-partes on the

basis that the Proctor for the Defendant must be taken to have appeared for

the Defendant at the trial. Therefore there was no default of appearance on

the part of the Defendant.

In the case of DE MEL vs. GUNASEKERA [(1939) 41 NLR 33], it was held

that if an advocate appeared and moved for a postponement, then

8

proceedings should be considered as inter-partes. In PERUMAL CHETTY vs.

GOONETILLEKE, [(1908) BAL. 02] the Supreme Court observed that there is

no requirement for the Defendant to appear personally and it is sufficient if he

is represented by counsel. This same approach followed by Wimalachandra,

J. in KANDASAMY vs. KANDASAMY, [(20062 SLR 260].

Thus, I am of the view that all the Defendants had been represented by their

Registered Attorney and he has entered in to the said settlement on behalf of

the all the Defendants.

Further, it is seen from the submissions made by Counsel for the Respondent

that, according to Section 754 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code, a party to

prefer an appeal should be dissatisfied with the judgment of the original Court

any error in fact or in law and it is clear that said provisions are not applicable

to an order entered in accordance with a settlement as there is no possibility

of being dissatisfied by an order made in accordance with terms of

settlements agreed upon by the parties.

Also, counsel for the Respondent correctly pointed out the above position with

the decision in the case SURIYAPPERUMA vs. SENANAYAKE [(1989) 1 SLR

325], this Court held that,

"Where parties agree to abide by the Court's decision after an inspection,

there is implied in it a waiver of all defences taken in the answer and a total

acceptance of the outcome of the Court's decision after the agreed

inspection. "

"The judgment and decree then are of consent of the parties and there is

no right of appeal. "

In the circumstances, this court in a view that the Appellants have no merits

to precede the appeal against the impugned order as it is clear that they

have represented and given their consent through their respective

attorneys to the terms of settlement on which the said order had been

made by the learned District Judge after carrying out a site inspection.

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned

District Judge. Accordingly I dismiss this appeal without Costs

Appeal dismissed.
