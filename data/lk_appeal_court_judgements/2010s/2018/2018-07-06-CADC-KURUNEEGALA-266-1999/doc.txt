T

his case raises the oft~recurring question whether the Plaintiff~ Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") has established title in a rei

vindicatio action.

The Plaintiff instituted this action on 15.11.1991 and an amended plaint was filed on

12.07.1996.The Plaintiff sought a declaration, inter alia, that she was the permit holder of

the land in question and ejectment of the Defendant~ Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Defendant").

The amended plaint led to an amended answer which was filed on 15.11.1996. The

respective cases as could be gleaned from the pleadings of the parties are goes as

follows:~

Plaintiff's Case

According to the amended plaint, the following averments are made.

2

a) On or about 15.09.1956 a Permit bearing No.32779 had been issued to her under

the Land Development Ordinance.

b) She developed the said land by bringing it under cultivation and in or about

December 1988 one ].M. Kirimudiyanse agreed to improve the said land by way

of cultivation and would possess the same paying the Plaintiff money for his

possession.

c) In early part of 1991 the Defendant who was claiming to be a son of

Kirimudiyanse entered the land and disputed the Plaintiff's title and possession.

d) She went before the Mediation Board to explore a possibility of a settlement, but

the Defendant did not agree to a settlement and he was in forcible possession.

e) In the circumstances she instituted this action seeking a declaration that she

was the lawful permit holder, ejectment of the Defendant and all those who were

holding under him.

Defendant's Case

The Defendant filed his amended answer and averred the following:-

a) The Plaintiff's purported permit was cancelled on 23.08.1993 and she was never

in possession of the corpus.

b) The subject-matter was a shrub jungle twenty years ago and it was he who had

cleared the jungle and effected the plantation.

c) The Plaintiff had fraudulently obtained a letter from his father to the effect that

he was cultivating the corpus under her.

d) The Defendant's father was originally cultivating the corpus and thereafter the

Defendant took over possession from the father and lived in the said property

having constructed a house.

e) The Defendant also claimed prescriptive title and prayed for a dismissal of the

Plaintiff's action.

Trial

No admissions were recorded at the trial. It would appear that Issues No.1 to 7 of the

Plaintiff are traceable to the amended plaint, whilst Issues No.8 to 14 of the Defendant

are hinged on the amended answer.

The permit produced on behalf of the Plaintiff was one that had been delivered in

favour of one Bramby Singho who subsequently transferred it to the Plaintiff. This

evidence emerged from one H.M. Ratnayake~the Colonization Office of the relevant

area~see Permit No.32779 dated 19.03.1957 marked as PI at the trial (p.142 of the appeal

brief).

Documents VI and V2 were marked through this witness in cross~examination. The

document VI (which is at p.50) notifies the Plaintiff that he had to deposit a sum of

Rs.1OO/ ~ and failure to deposit would result in a cancellation of the permit. This notice

of cancellation had been issued under Section 19 of the Land Development Ordinance.

The witness himself admitted VI to be a notice of cancellation.

The document V2 is a copy of a cancellation of the permit PI and the witness admitted

that it was indeed a proper termination of the permit. The witness indentified the

signature of the Divisional Secretary who had signed the said revocation of permit and

thus the witness testified in response to questions from Court that a cancellation of the

permit had been effected by 23.08.1993. The original plaint in the case was filed on

15.11.1993 and by that time there had been a defeasance of title of the Plaintiff.

The 2nd witness for the Plaintiff was the Plaintiff's son who produced Plan No. 95153

prepared by the Court Commissioner S. Wijetunga dated 25.09.1995 and his report

marked P3. Upon a perusal of the amended plaint dated 18.07.1996, it is clear that the

amended plaint came about after the Commissioned survey.

The Plaintiff's son also produced P4~a letter purported to have been given by the father

of the Defendant one Kirimudiyanse to establish the fact that the Kirimudiyanse came

into possession to cultivate the land as a result of an agreement between the Plaintiff

and Kirimudiyanse. Though the Plaintiff's son testified that his mother'S permit

4

devolved on him, he did not produce any instrument of devolution. When he was

confronted with V2, he admitted that this was a cancellation of the permit.

Kirimudiyanse who was summoned to prove P4 gave a different version that he did not

come into possession of the land consequent to P4.

There is also uncertainty as to the corpus. The Commissioner Wijetunga who gave

evidence testified that he could not properly identify the corpus described in the plaint.

As opposed to this evidence, the Defendant was assertive that he had been in exclusive

possession for well over 20 years and had been living thereon for more than 12 years.

The tenor of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Kurunegala

proceeds on the fact finding as to whether two very important aspects of a rei vindicatio

have been proved namely a) title to property and b) identity of corpus.

It is trite law that a permit holder is entitled to institute a rei vindicatio action~see the

dictum of Gratiaen, J. in D.P. Palisena v. KK D. Perera 56 N.LR. 407. Upon a perusal

of the evidence led in the case, when the Plaintiff instituted this action on 15.11.l993,

there was no title that inhered in the Plaintiff. Thus he could not have instituted this

action.

As regards the identity of corpus, the Commission issued to the Surveyor was to survey

Lot 37 in Final Village Plan bearing No. 2756 but the land he surveyed was quite

different~so stated the Surveyor in evidence.

Justice Marsoof in Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef and Another v. Abdul Majeed

Mohomad Mansoorand Another (2010) 2 Sri LR. 333 laid down that the identity of

corpus was a mandatory requirement in a rei vindicatio action. It accords with reason

because the decree to yield up possession must identify the property with its proper

metes and bounds.

Thus it is crystal clear that the Plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof

which was quite pithily summed up by Heart, J. in Wanigaratne v. Juwanis 65 N.LR.

167 ~ "In an action rei vindicatio, the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He cannot

5

ask for a declaration in his favour merely on the strength that the defendant's title is

poor or not established".

In other words the burden does not shift to the Defendant unless the Plaintiff has

established his title.

In the circumstances I encounter no error of law or fact in the judgment of the

Additional District Judge of Kurunegala and I see no reason to interfere with the

judgment dated 01.12.1998, wherein he had dismissed the case of the Plaintiff.

I accordingly affirm the said judgment and dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant

with costs.
