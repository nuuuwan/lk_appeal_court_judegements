The Petitioner- On 04.10.2018

The Respondent - On 15.10.2018

02.11.2018

The petitioner filed this revision applica' ion seeking to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge ofNegombo dated 29.05.2017 in Bail Application No:

HCAB 55/2017.

Facts of the Case:

The petitioner was arrested with another on 23.12.2015 with a quantity of Heroin

497g and 600mg and was produced before the Learned Magistrate of Negombo

under case No. 3691115. Thereafter the petitioner was remanded. The Govemmen:

analyst's report indicated that the amount of pure heroin was 158.65 grams. The

wife of the petitioner had filed a bail apphcation in the High Court ofNegombo on

behalf of the petitioner and the Learned High Court Judge had refused the same on

14.12.2016. Another bail application ;vas filed before the same Court on

14.02.2017 since the indictment was no: filed by that time. The Learned High

~ Court Judge dismissed the said applicfltion on 29.05.2017 as there were no

exceptional circumstances to grant bail.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the petitioner filed a revision application in

this Court seeking to revise the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Negombo dated 29.05.2017.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner Siubmitted that the order of the Learned

High Court Judge was contrary to law since the Learned High Court Judge had

, failed to consider that the petitioner had' no previous convictions and/or pending

cases.

It is trite law that the suspects and ~~cused under the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance shall be kept in remand unless exceptional

circumstances are demonstrated. The reqllirement of exc.eptional circumstances is

stated in section 83 of the said Ordinance as amended by the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs [amendment] Act No.13, of 1984.

In the case of Labynidarage Nishanthi V. Attorney General rCA (PHC) APN , 48/2014], it was held that,

"It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under the above

act will be admitted to bail only in terms of section 83(1) of the said Act and

it is only on Exceptional circumstan:es. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant

to note, the term "exceptional circumstances" has not been explained or

defined in any of the Statutes. Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding

in what creates a circumstance which is exceptional in nature ... "

In the case of Attorney General V. S.R.Dammika Gunawardene rCA (PHC)

APN 151/2016], it was held that,

"In the case of Mohamed Shiyam, it was held that for an offence of

committed under the above act, sec, ion 83 of the said act will be applicable

Page 3 )f 11

and according to section 83, bai' will be granted only on exceptional

circumstances.

In the case of CA (PHC) APN 119.1]009 a case where the quantity was 4. 7

I gms. It was held that "the first gro~tnd thefact that the suspect had been on

remand for over 4 years cannot t. (? taken as constituting the exceptional

circumstance in view of the punishment that could be imposedfor an offence

of this nature where the charge ca~'ries a sentence of life imprisonment or

death ... "

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted the case of C.A. No. 53/2000

(PH C) , in which it was held that,

"The suspect has no previous conviCtions or pending cases. Considering the

long period of incarceration, we enlqrge the suspect ... "

Accordingly the Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the time period

of incarceration coupled up with other facL such as having no previous convictions

or pending cases would constitute an exceI;tional circumstance.

However, we observe that the suspect in the aforesaid case was taken into custody

in connection with a fraud at the State Mot,~gage Bank. The petitioner of the instant

revision application had been remanded for offences of trafficking and possession

of heroin under the Poisons Opium and Dallgerous Drugs Ordinance. Therefore the

gravity and the nature of the offences and the punishments to be imposed are

different in both cases.

In the case of Ranil Charuka KulathungaV. AG lCA (PHC) APN 134/2015], it

was held that,

, Page 4 o~ 11

.<

"The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams, which is a

" commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the punishment is death or

life imprisonment. Under the.r;e circumstances, it is prudent to conclude the

trial early while the Petitioner is kept in custody ... "

Therefore we are mindful that tbjere is a higher risk of absconding since the

punishment to be imposed if convkted is death sentence or life imprisonment.

The Learned Senior State Coum ~l for the respondent has submitted that the

indictment was sent to the High Court of Negambo on 12.12.2017. Presently the

case has been fixed for hearing on 1)9.01.2019.

The Learned Counsel for the pe :itioner has submitted following two cases In

support of his contention;

1. Gurusamy V. Ramaling'lm [CA. 119/2000]

2. W. Neville Fernando V. O.I.C., Terrorist Investigation Unit [CA.

44/2002]

In these two cases suspects were \released on bail. However in the case or Cader

(on behalf of Rashid Kahan) V.: Officer in Charge, Narcotics Bureau (2006) 3

SLR 74, Justice Basnayake, observed as follows;

"In Gurusamy vs. Ramalil gam, the facts are as follows:

* The quantity ofher~in in possession - 6.2 grams.

* The period of remand - 23 months.

* The Government -(ftzalyst's Report was sent on 31.07.2001

* There were neither.previous convictions nor pending cases .

.'

Page 5 of 11

* The indictment had not helm sent although the State Counsel was , given five dates to forward tne same.

The Court of Appeal in their Order did not refer to any of the above facts

constituting exceptional circumste-.nces, but bail in a sum of Rs. 100,000/-

I cash bail "considering the long period ofremand". In Neville Fernando vs. o. I. C. Terrorist investigation Unit the Court of Appeal on 6.2.2003

enlarged the suspect on cash bai.': in a sum of Rs. 50,000/- in addition to

other conditions. The facts in this case are:

* The suspect was taken in tv custody with 14 Kilo grams of heroin

* The suspect had been 0"1 remand for a period of one year ten

months.

* The Indictment had alreqdy been dispatched to the relevant High

Court

The learned Counsel for the suspect submitted to court that trial would not

be taken for at least five months: due to the heavy trial roll. His Lordship

Justice Edirisuriya held that "end's of Justice will be met by granting bail"

and again the court does not re.:er to any of the above facts constituting

exceptional circumstances .

... In the six cases mentioned above, it was only in one case the court

considered the facts constituting exceptional circumstances in granting bail.

I In all the other cases the court refrained from referring to a specific

ground as constituting exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the question

\ is, should the facts of those cases be considered as constituting exceptional

circumstances? In Milroy Fernando's case the court allowed bail after

considering the extent to which the suspect had been involving in the

Page 6 of 11

commission of the crime. Could we consider the period in remand as a

ground constituting an exceptionc!/ circumstance? Provision has been made

in the Bail Act to release persons: on bail if the period of remand extends , . , more than 12 months .. No such ttovision is found in the case of Poison,

; Opium and Dangerous Drugs O~'dinance. Although bail was granted in

some of the cases mentioned abo;Je. None of these cases refer to the time ~

period in remand as constituting kn exceptional circumstance. Hence bail

! cannot be considered on that groU".'d alone. It appears from the cases cited

above that there is no guiding pr~l1ciple with regard to the quantity found

either. The fact of dispatching tire indictment too cannot be considered

either for or against the grantinb' of bail. In one of the cases mentioned

above, the fact of not sending th.; indictment was considered in favor of

granting bail while in another case, sending the indictment was not

considered to refuse bail ... "(EmpLasis added)

We agree with the observation of the Justice Basnayake in the aforesaid case. We

are of the view that a suspect of a case is not entitled to bail merely because

\. another suspect was granted bail in a pr~vious heroin case. A wide discretion has

been vested with Courts in deciding w4at constitutes exceptional circumstances

since statutes do not precisely define the same.

In the case of Ramu Thamotharampilla i V. Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri. L.R

180, it was held that,

"The decision must in each cas:, depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances. But in order that Vke cases may be decided alike and that

there will be ensured some unijorn:/ty of decisions it is necessary that some

guidance should be laid down for tIle exercise of that discretion. .. "

.. ~

Page 1 of 11

However we are unable to find any guidelines on exceptional circumstances from

the case of Wasantha Neville Fernando Since Justice Edirisuriya had not laid down

the same. In the said case it was held tha~,

"Having considered the submis~;;')ns made by Mr. Kulatunga I am of the

view that the ends of Justice will b;~ met by granting bail to the suspect ... "

We are not given the opportunity of knqwing the submissions which satisfied that

Court to grant bail. Therefore we are not inclined to grant bail in the instant

I application following the aforesaid dech;ion, simply because both cases are under

the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It is our considered view that

each Court has discretion to decide W!lat constitutes exceptional circumstances

depending on the facts of each case.

In the case of Rasheed Ali v. Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

"It is well established that the pqwers of revision conferred on this Court

are very wide and the Court has (he discretion to exercise them whether an

appeal lies or not or whether an ~ppeal where it lies has been taken or not.

i But this discretionary remedy !.can be invoked only where there are

exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of the Court ... "

Further we observe that by the time the\Leamed High Court Judge considered the

second bail application, remand period of the petitioner was one year and 04

months.

In the case of Labukola Ange Wisin ~Gedara Ashni Dhanushika V. AG lCA

(PHC) APN 4/2016], it was held that,

"In the present case the petitioner failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances warranting this cO~j;rt to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

Page B of 11

The petitioner's first point is that the suspect is in remand nearly for two

years. The intention of the legislatt.re is to keep in remand any person who

is suspected or accused of Poss?ssing or trafficking heroin until the , conclusion of the case. The section 83(1) of the Act expresses the intention of

the legislature ... "

Accordingly the Learned High Court JUdfe was correct in refusing to consider the

incarceration period as an exceptional cilbumstance. We are of the view that the

Learned High Court Judge would get a beltl~r opportunity to consider enlarging the

petitioner on bail when the trial commences in January 2019.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel <,lnd others [2004] 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

\ have occasioned a failure of justic~' and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irre~~ularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience'?f court. "

In the case of M.Roshan Dilruk Fernal1,jo V. AG rCA (PHC) 03/2016], it was

held that,

"It is settled law that the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision can be

invoked only on establishing the exc!f?ptional circumstances. The requirement

of exceptional circumstances has bze,'1 held in a series of authorities.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd (2003)

3 SLR 24, where it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstc:nces is the process by which the court

, selects the cases in respect of; which the extraordinary method of

Page 9l .< 11

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal ... "

We do not see any illegality, irregularity or defect in the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Negombo dated 29.05.2017. Therefore we affirm the same.

However we reserve the right to the petitioner to make another bail application

before the High Court when the trial commences.

The revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
