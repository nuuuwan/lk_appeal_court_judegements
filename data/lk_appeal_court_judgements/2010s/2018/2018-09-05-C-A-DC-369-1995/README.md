M.M.AGAFOOR, J.

This is an appeal stemming from the judgement of the learned District Judge of

Matale in respect ofa Partition Action Case No. 1525/P.

The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'Plaintiff') instituted

this action seeking inter alia to partition of the land called 'Gonnagahamula'

more fully described in the schedule to the Plaint.

According to the Plaintiff's pedigree, L.M. Mudiyanse, L.M.Tikiri Banda and

Appuhamy were the original owners of the land described in the schedule to the

plaint. As per the pedigree set out in the plaint, L.M. Mudiyanse and L.M.

Tikiri Banda transferred their each 113 shares to Tikiri Dureya by way of deed

No. 1686 dated 07.01.1932 and No. 1171 dated 06.02.1932 respectively.

(Marked as PI and P2)

In addition to another person called Appuhamy who owned undivided 113

share of the same land above described, transferred his 1/6 share to Dingiri

Banda. Later Dingiri Banda transferred his 1/6 share to Tikiri Dureya and

Bandiya as 116 for each of them. After this transfer (by the deed No. 9149 dated

18.02.1908) Tikiri Dureya has got 9/12 shares of the land. After demise of

Tikiri Dureya, the two sons of him Baalaya and Ukkuwa (2nd and 8th

Defendants) inherited the share each of 9/24th of the land.

But in the District Court the 1 st Defendant - Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the 'Appellant') claimed that she is a grand-daughter of Tikiri Dureya, as her

mother Sob ani is a daughter ofTikiri Dureya.

Thereafter, the Appellant fIled her statement of claim stating inter alia that the Ih

of shares of the land sought to be partitioned be allotted to her, since she has

inherited the said 112 share out from the corpus as described in the statement of

claim. Thereby she claimed for an additional share from Tikiri Dureya's

property.

The Appellant further claimed that the buildings marked as '5)', '8', '~', and '(5'

of the Preliminary Plan and the Plantation in the Lot No.3, 4 and 5 depicted in

the Preliminary Plan marked as 'X'. The Appellant further sought an order

from the Court directing the Respondent to furnish a Plan by which the land

sought to partitioned is correctly depicted. But the Plaintiff's position (according

to his plaint) was that entitlement of Tikiri Dureya was inherited to Ukkuwa

and Baalaya as they were the only children of Tikiri Dureya.

In the District Court trail, the Plaintiff gave evidence and produced the

documents marked as X, Y, Z and ~l - 1 to ~l - 4 while the pt Defendant-

Appellant gave evidence on behalf of the Defendants and produced the

documents marked ~ - 1 to ~ - 4.

After conclusion of the trail, the learned District Judge of Matale delivered the

judgment on 03rd February 1995 rejecting the position of the Appellant and

holding the corpus of the land called 'Gonnagahamula' in favour of the

Plaintiff.

Being aggrieved with judgment dated Q3rd February 1995, the Appellant has

preferred this appeal to this Court, seeking a reversal of the judgment and grant

of other prayed for in the petition of appeal. And further submitted before this

Court that the plaintiff has failed to identify the corpus because the Plaintiff has

sought to partition the land in extent of 2 Acres 2 Roods and 38 Perches as

described in the schedule to the plaint.

Page I 5

However, in the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 3265 prepared by K.S.

Samarasinghe Licensed Surveyor, the extent of land which was surveyed is a

land of 2 Acres 2 Roods and 19 Perches.

When this matter was mentioned in this Court, the Respondents were not

present, though the Court issued notices on them several occasions. Even after

the notices have been served, the Respondents were failed to present before this

Court. For that reason this Court decided to take up the matter ex-parte.

In this case, the Appellant claims for two different shares. She states that, Tikiri

Dureya had two children namely, Ukkuwa and Baalaya from a Marriage. And

Tikkiri Dureya had a daughter namely, Sobani in addition to said sons and she

is a daughter of Sobani, therefore the Appellant claims that she should entitle

the shares by way of inheritance from Sobani in addition to the portion of land

which received from the deed No. 22436.

The Appellant gave evidence and demonstrated her position as follows:

" .... Bt36 ~6GO:J~ ~~d &<c2lS)~ S~ ~&Q}2S)e):J. ~GO:J Bt36 ~6GO:J&a:f 1

<c6z.e)2ri C~~e):J e"w 6l:JCGO:J " (Page at 77)

In this court, the learned Counsel for the Appellant earlier submitted that, the

only issue to be determined of this case is whether Tikiri Dureya had three

children by the names of 'Baalaya', 'Ukkuwa' and 'Sobani' or whether he had

only two children namely, 'Baalaya' and 'Ukkuwa'. The pt Defendant-

Appellant claims title from M.P.Sarangi by way of a deed marked ID3 and she

also claims that she was a daughter of' Sobani' .

For this argument the Appellant did not provide any further evidence to lead

her claim. But she is in a position that in the cross-examination the plaintiff has

given evidence corroborating the fact that Tikiri Dureya had two families and

Sobani is daughter of him.

Even though, the learned District judge was not satisfied on Appellant's claim

that there was a lawful inheritance-relationship with Tikiri Dureya. Therefore,

he concluded that there is no evidence to prove that Sobani is a lawful

daughter of Tikiri Dureya.

As has been stated by this Court and the Supreme Court in several precedents

before, the duty of the Court in a partition action is primarily to investigate the

title of the parties to the case to its satisfaction.

In Peds vs Perera (1896) I N.L.R 362 Bonser C.J. held as follows;

"It is obvious that the court ought not to make a decree, except it is perfectly satisfied

that the persons in whose favour it makes the decree are entitled to the property. The

court should not, as it seems to me, regard these actions as merely to be decided on

issues raised by and between the parties.

The first thing the Court has to do is to satisfy itself that the plaintiff has made out his

title, jar, unless he makes out his title, his action cannot be maintained; and he must

prove his title strictly, as has been frequently pointed out by this Court. " (Page at 367)

Comparable dicta are found in many decisions such as Fernando vs.

Mohammedu Saibo (1899) 3 NL.R 32, Mather vs. Thamotheram Pillai (1903) 6

NL.R 246 and Neelakutty vs Alvar (1918) 20 NL.R 372.

It is most relevant to record the guidelines of Chettiar vs. Kumarihamy (1944) 45

N.L.R 332, Wijewardena J. held that

"In a partition action the duty is cast upon the Judge to satisfy himself that the

property to be partitioned does not belong to persons, who are not parties to the action.

Page I 7

With regard to the decision on this question the court would consider the evidence

without regard to the issue. "

I observe that in the instance case, there was a duty cast on the trail judge to

satisfy himself as to identify the interested parties of the land, and for this

purpose it was always open to him to find out the evidence from the entire fact

and call for further evidence or witness in order to make a proper investigation.

In Thayalanayagam vs. Kathiresapillai (1910) 5 Balasingam L.R 10, Hutchinson,

C.J said:

"In a partition action such as this is, I think that the judge has power, and that in

some cases it may be his duty, even after the parties have closed their case, to call for

further evidence. (But if he does, he must do it in a regular manner) ... "

In the case of Karunaratne vs. Sirimalie (1951) 53 N.L.R 444, the Supreme

Court held that,

"Where, in a partition action, all possible claimants to the property are manifestly

before the court, no higher standard of proof should be called for in determining the

question of title than in any other civil suit"

And further it is pertinent to recall the finding of Fernando J in Golagoda vs.

Mohideen (1937) 40 N.L.R 92, he said that a trail judge 'perfectly satisfy'

himself whether the claimants who are parties to the proceedings or property in

question actual parties or not.

I agree with the above rationales. And in the present case, the only outstanding

question for determination was therefore whether the Appellant had

satisfactorily established on a balance of probability that she has a valid title to

claim a different shares from said land as she is a grand-daughter of Tikiri

Dureya and whether she has an inherited additional - rights on the land.

In this point, I am of the view that in the District Court, the Appellant failed to

establish her claim that she is a lawful heir of Tikiri Dureya. Therefore, the

Page 18

learned District Judge answered this question in negative, he find in difficult to

fathom the validity of the marriage of Sobani.

In my opinion, the learned District Judge correctly evaluate the above issue,

firstly he evaluated the evidence to find a legal relationship between Tikiri

Dureya and the Appellant. Secondly, he evaluated the pedigree of the plaintiff

and found that the Appellant get the shares from Appuhamy who was an

original owner of the land not from Tikiri Dureya. Therefore, the pedigree

clearly shows the Appellant's position that she cannot inherited any shares from

Tikiri Dureya.

In Upageeris vs. Odanis (1964) 67 N.L.R 521, a partition action dismissed on the

ground that the marriage of a person from whom the plaintiff derived this rights

had not been registered. But in the appeal the Appellate Court allowed re-

submitting the marriage certificate. At the same time the Judges of the Supreme

Court directed the District Judge to investigate whether the appellant was a

legitimate child of that marriage.

Further, I think it is vital to have a note on the case of Appuhamy vs. Perera 56

c.L.W 32 and Cooray vs. Wijesuriya 62 N.L.R 158. In Appuhamy vs. Perera,

Basnayake C.J held that, a trail judge need to observe the provisions of

Evidence Ordinance even in a partition case and His Lordship further held that

'it is important that even in partition action evidence that is not relevant

according to the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance should not be admitted.'

Basnayake C.J. in Cooray vs. Wijesuriya emphasised that,

Section 25 of the Partition Act imposes on the Court the obligation to examine

carefully the title of each party to the action. Apart from proof by the production of

birth, death and marriage certificates, the relevant provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance in regard to proof of a pedigree are to found in sections 32 (5), 32 (6) and

50(2)

Page I 9

And the following phrases of the Basnayake C.J. are noteworthy:

" The relevant provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to proof of a pedigree

are to befound in section 32 (5), section 32 (6) and section 50 (2)-1 am omittingfor

the moment proof by the production of birth, death and maniage certificates. It

almost always happens that birth and death certificates of persons who have died very

long ago are not available: in such cases the only way of establishing relationship is by

hearsay evidence. Section 32 (5) of the Evidence Ordinance renders a statement made

by a deceased person admissible:-

UWhen the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood,

marriage, or adoption between persons as to whose relationship by blood,

marriage, .or adoption the person making the statement had special means of

knowledge, and when the statement was made before the question in dispute

was raised. "

It is under this provision of law that oral evidence of pedigree is generally sought to be

led. What practitioners and the Court sometimes lose sight of is the fact that before

such evidence can be led there must be proof that the hearsay evidence sought to be

given is in respect of a statement made by a person having special means of knowledge

: furthennore, it must have been made ante litem motam . Where the statement is

made by a member of the family such knowledge may be inferred or even presumed,

but where it is a statement made by an outsider proof of special means of knowledge

must first be established.

Therefore, these findings seem to me that, in partition action a party can build

their own evidence through in perfectly satisfied way with the Evidence

Ordinance too.

Therefore, the Appellant had a good chance to establish her position with

appropriate evidence. However, I observe that the Appellant failed on her

position at this juncture. It is quite manifest that the plaintiff has failed to

establish her claim (additional shares) by legally admissible evidence.

Page /10

Appellant's another submission before this Court was that the plaintiff has

failed to identify the corpus because the Plaintiff has sought to partition the land

in extent of 2 Acres 2 Roods and 38 Perches as described in the schedule to the

plaint. However, in the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 3265 prepared by K.S.

Samarasinghe Licensed Surveyor, extent of the land which was surveyed is a

land of 2 Acres 2 Roods and 19 Perches. Therefore, the Appellant further

submitted that the plaintiff has failed to identify of the corpus and learned

District Judge has not considered these discrepancy of the extent of the corpus

and variety of the boundaries.

After the evaluation of the deeds submitted by both parties, it is seem to me that

the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 3265 only indicate the extent of the land as 2

Acres 2 Roods 19 Perches but there is no a single discrepancy on the

boundaries.

Deeds marked by the Plaintiff, Appellant to the land called 'Gonnagahamula'

are indicating a same extent as 2 Acres 2 Roods and 38 Perches. The same

descriptions has probably been copied from an earlier original deed and

conveyed by all parties. The subsequent misdescription cannot alter the effect of

that conveyance. Further the trail of this action proceeded after certain matters

in dispute between the parties were recorded, but no specific issue was framed

regarding the actual corpus to be partitioned.

I am in a view that this is a case of "fa/sa demonstratio non nocet" (Dzd?

t}e.1tsJd",Zd fiJJzf)",td' Be @2:5)J@t) - page at 181, Glossary of Technical Terms,

Department of Official Languages). It is a legal maxim that means a false

description doesn't void a document if the intent is clear.

The maxim falsa demonstratio, defined in Oxford Dictionary of Law, 8th ed. by

Jonathan Law (Oxford University Press; 2015, page at 254) as follows:

"A mle applied where a description of something in a legal document (e.g. a will)

is made up of more than one part, and one part is tme, but the other false: if the

Page 111

part that is true describes the subject with sufficient legal certainty, then the untrue

part will not vitiate the document. "

To proceed further, I respectfully recall the vital findings of their Lordships

Basnayake and Gratian JJ in the case of Gabriel Perera vs. Agnes Perera and

Others 43 C.L. W 82. It is settled and well known rule of interpretation of deeds

that, where the portion conveyed is perfectly described, and can be precisely

ascertained, and no difficulty arises except from a subsequent inconsistent

statement as to its extent, the inconsistency as to extent should be treated as

mere falsa demonstratio not affecting that which is already sufficiently conveyed.

Their Lordships were emphasised their views with a land marked decision of

Llewellyn vs. EarlofJersev (1843) L. J. Ex 243.

The same approach followed by Akbar J. in the case of De Silva vs. Abeytileke

(33 NLR 154) in this case, following finding of Akbar J. is noteworthy;

" .. .[IJn the case of Eastwood v. Ashton (1915) A. C. 900, Lord Sumner quoted

with approval certain English decisions asfollows:-" My Lords, the principle on

which this case was decided in the Court of Appeal was thus stated by Parke B. in

Llewellyn v. Earl of Jersey. As soon as there is an adequate and sufficient

definition, with convenient certainty, of what is intended to pass by a deed, any

subsequent erroneous addition will not vitiate it. "

Moreover, it is further note that in the case of Eastwood v. Ashton held that, if

there any discrepancy in a description of a good (rem), the vonder is not entitled

to take over the good (rem). The furthest they can go is to make a claim for

compensation, vide Fernando v. Sumangala (1920) 22 N. L. R. 23 and De Silva

vs. Abeytileke (33 NLR 154).

In the light of above decisions and authorities, I observe that there are no

obstacles in front of me to ratify the deeds which have been submitted by the

plaintiff in the District Court.

The description on deeds - (2 Acres 2 Roods and 19 Perches) has probably been

copied from an earlier original deed and conveyed by all parties.

Page 112

Therefore, I do not interfere with the judgment of the learned District Judge.

For the forgoing reasons, I dismiss the claims made by the Appellant. And I

affirm the judgment dated 03.02.1995.

I dismiss the appeal. However, I order no costs.
