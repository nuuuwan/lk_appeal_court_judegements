The Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court inter alia, to

seek, a mandate in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1 st to

8th Respondents denying the Petitioners of their promotion to the post of Assistant

General Manager of the 1 st Respondent Bank. In the written submissions filed of

record the Petitioners state that presently they are not in service in the 1st

Respondent Bank and therefore, would not peruse a mandate in the nature of writ

of Mandamus for re-instatement, but instead be satisfied with the lessor remedy of

a declaratory order compelling the promotion of the Petitioners to the post of

Assistant General Manager. The Petitioners also seek a writ of Mandamus

compelling the said Respondents to pay back wages and other retirement benefits

applicable to the post of Assistant General Manager with retrospective effect.

4

The Petitioners were among several other semor officers of the 1 st

Respondent Bank, who were eligible to apply for the post of Assistant General

Manager in terms of circular 6112007, marked P2. According to the said circular,

when an application is received for consideration, the personnel Department

submits their comments and observations to the General Manager regarding the

acceptance or rejection of such application. Staff Department Circular No.

36/2002, marked P3, sets out the scheme of promotion and the evaluation criteria

of the applicants to the said post.

By this application, the Petitioners are challenging the decision dated

24/0112008, by the Board of Directors of the 1 st Respondent Bank, promoting nine

other applicants with the exclusion of the Petitioners, as reflected by the circular

marked P6.

The Respondents, have raised several preliminary objections to this

application, inter-alia, that;

(a) the relationship between the Petitioner's and the 1 st Respondent is based on

contract and is a relationship of employment which is not amenable to writ

jurisdiction.

(b) the Petitioner's are guilty of laches due to the undue delay in invoking the

jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the impugned decision and therefore

the application should fail.

5

In response, the Petitioners have drawn attention of Court to document

marked Pl(a), and submits that the 1st Respondent Bank is a statutory functionary

created by statute and therefore, the relationship between the parties are statutory.

The Petitioners have also drawn attention of Court to Section 6 of the Bank of

Ceylon Ordinance No. 53 of 1938, where it is stated that,

"The management and administration of the affairs of the bank shall be

vested in a board, consisting of six directors appointed by the Minister one

of whom shall be a representative of the Ministry in charge of the minister

to whom the subject offinance is assigned. "

In the said background, I will deal with the preliminary objection (a) stated

above, in the first instance, since the said issue goes to the root of this application,

which could decide its worth.

It is observed that, internal administration policy applicable to promotions

are communicated to the relevant officers by the Personal Policy Committee,

through staff department Circulars. As observed in documents marked PIB and

PIC, the Personal Policy Committee at its meetings decide on promotions of

applicants and communicates, inter alia, the date of such promotion, to the

relevant officers by way of circular. The Board of Directors at a meeting held on

18/0112008, has decided on promotions of applicants to the post of Assistant

General Manager, and has communicated the date of such promotion to the

relevant officers by the impugned Circular marked P6.

6

In the case of Piyasiri Vs. Peoples Bank (1982) 2SLR 47, this Court has

considered the effect of a direction given to the Board of Directors in terms of the

People's Bank Act, to implement the recommendations relating to promotions of

Bank clerks in consequence of the Board of Directors issuing a Circular to

formulate the implementation of the said recommendation. In this case,

"the Petitioner who is a clerk in the Respondent Bank has applied for an

order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondent to call

the Petitioner for an interview in terms of the Staff Circular No. 186/82

dated 27/05/1982, in respect of promotion to Grade IlL Class 1 "

The Respondent Bank took up several preliminary objections among which

was that the Respondent Bank "is not a public authority nor a department of the

state amenable to the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court, but is an independent

corporate body engage in the purely commercial activity of the business of

b k " an zng ... ..... .

The court held, inter alia, that;

"the Bank though subject to ministerial control is not a public body but

basically a commercial bank. "

In this context the Court has to determine whether the impugned circular

marked P6 has any statutory force.

7

The Petitioners submit that the appointment of staff to the Bank by Circular

marked P6, is not governed by ordinary contractual relationship but by a statutory

relationship which underpins a statutory right. However, the Petitioners have not

urged a violation of a specific statutory right which deprived the Petitioners of an

employment contract.

"In the case of Malloch Vs. Aberdeen Corp. (1971) 2 All ER 1278 Lord

Wilberforce said that it was the existence of statutory provisions which injects the

element of public law necessary to attract the remedies of administrative law".

This case has been cited with approval, in Piyasiri Vs. People's Bank (supra).

In terms of Section 56 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance, the Board of

Directors are empowered to appoint staff to the Bank. Accordingly, statutes can

expressly or impliedly confer power on a public body to enter into contracts in

order to enable it to discharge its functions.

However, as Sir Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law 5th Edition,

at page 558 has observed,

"Contracts of employment between public bodies and their staff may not

raise any public law issue, and the enforcement of specific contractual

rights and the question of the remedies available will be dealt with in

accordance with the usual principles applicable to such disputes. "

8

In the circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection marked (a), that

the impugned circular marked P6, does not raise any public law issue and

therefore, the Petitioners have no legal right for the reliefs prayed for. In view of

the said finding it would not be necessary to deal with the rest of the objections

raised by the Respondents.

Petition is dismissed without costs.
