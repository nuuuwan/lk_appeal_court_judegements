JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of the

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura praying for a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent

4

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Respondent) contained in the

letter dated 2010-06-09. That is a letter by which the 3rd Respondent had

informed the Appellant that the 1st Respondent is the tenant cultivator of

the paddy field relevant to the dispute.

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned State Counsel

submitted that the Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to grant a writ

in the instant case even if the arguments on behalf of the Appellant

succeeds. He cited the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

Maithilee Pathmanjalee Wijesuriya Vs. Nimalawathie Wanigasinghe and two

othersl.

The case cited above is an appeal filed in the Supreme Court against a

judgment of this Court holding that Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development is not a person exercising any powers within the province

and as such the Provincial High Court lacked the requisite jurisdiction to

issue writs against such decisions.

The Supreme Court in that case stated as follows;

1 SC Appeal No. 33/2007, decided on 2008-06-26 (A copy of this judgment is at page 132 of the appeal brief).

5

" .... The Commissioner General's order though acting upon a matter

occurring in a province (as it must since all matters arise in some province

or another), is merely an exercise of power in relation to such province.

Such "island-wide" powers are appropriately the domain of the jurisdiction

of the Appellate Courts with "island-wide" jurisdiction ..... "

The Supreme Court in that case, had proceeded to affirm the judgment of

this Court.

Although the above case was cited before the learned Provincial High Court

Judge, he has opted to rely on the judgment in the case of Madduma

Bandara V Assisstant Commissioner of Agrarian Development,2 to hold that

the Provincial High Court does have jurisdiction to issue the writs sought by

the Appellant.

Indeed the perusal of the judgment in Maithilee Pathmanjalee Wijesuriya

case, shows that her Ladyship and their Lordships who decided that case

had not attempted to deviate from the conclusions of that judgment.

Since Madduma Bandara V Assisstant Commissioner of Agrarian

Development,3 is also a judgment of the Supreme Court, this Court cannot

fault the learned Provincial High Court Judge in following that judgment.

On the other hand, the order of the Provincial High Court on the

preliminary objection had been delivered by it on 2012-02-01. The instant

appeal has been filed after the final judgment pronounced by the Provincial

High Court. The judgment of the Provincial High Court which is challenged

in this appeal is the judgment delivered by it on 2012-05-03. In these

circumstances it is the view of this Court that it should consider the merits

of this appeal.

It is the finding by the learned 'Provincial High Court Judge that the

Appellant had failed to tender before the Provincial High Court, certain

material namely a copy of the affidavit he had tendered before the

inquiring officer at the inquiry.

Perusal of the notes of inquiry reveals that both parties had undertaken to

tender affidavits setting out their respective positions before the inquiring

officer. This means that the above material should be available for the

32003 Sri. L.R. 80.

Petitioner to tender before the Provincial High Court. It is after

consideration of all relevant material that the 2nd Respondent had arrived

at the impugned decision.

The Petitioner has failed to produce before the Provincial High Court, the

said material despite the objection raised by the 1st Respondent regarding

the failure to tender it. It was therefore the conclusion of the Provincial

High Court that the Appellant had failed to prove that the decision made by

the 2nd Respondent is an illegality.

In the case of Council of Civil Service Unions and others Vs Minister for the

Civil Service 4 Lord Diplock classified the grounds for judicial review into 3

main categories in following terms.

''Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about one can conveniently classify under 3 heads the grounds upon

which the administrative action are subject to control by judicial review.

The 1st ground I would call "illegality~ the second "irrationality'; and the

third ''procedural impropriety'~ That is not to say that further development

on a case by case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I

have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle

of 'proportionality' which is recognized in the administrative law of several

4 1984 03 A E R 935.

8

of our fellow members of the European Economic Community; but to

dispose of the instant case the three already well-established heads that I

have mentioned will suffice. '" " 5

In the case of Sirisena Cooray Vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayaka and two

others6 the Supreme Court referring to the above case, stated as follows.

" ... The grounds of judicial review were originally broadly classified as

three-fold The first ground is illegality; the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and

must give effect to it. The second is ''irrationality// namely Wednesbury

unreasonableness (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd V Wednesbury

Corporation. The third is ''procedural impropriety/~ (Halsbury 4h ed./ Vol 11 ,

para 60). To these grounds a fourth may be added ''proportionality// See

Lord Diplock in CCSU V Minister for the Civil Service at 951. ... "

Perusal of the material adduced before Court clearly shows that the

Appellant has failed to satisfy Court that any of the above grounds for a

writ of certiorari has been made out.

Further, the Appellant has not explained as to why he could not provide

the material that he is alleged to have not produced before the Provincial

High Court along with his application.

Rule 3 (1) (aY states as follows:

Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

The Appellant has clearly breached the above rule also.

This Court is satisfied after perusal of the judgment of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge that the conclusions arrived at and the reasons

7Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

10

given thereto by him are in order and thus requires no intervention by this

Court.

In these circumstances, this Court affirms the judgment of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge dated 2012-05-03 and proceed to dismiss this

appeal with costs.
