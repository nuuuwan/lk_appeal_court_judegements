**************

The petitioner in this "application is a farmer and the 4th

respondent is the elder brother of the petitioner. The petitioner

claimed that he and his father from 1970 were in possession of the

land depicted as Lot Nos.188 and 189 in plan referred to therein

situated at No.13, Erabadu Oya, Parakrama Samudraya,

Pollonnaruwa and they developed the said land by cultivating

paddy and constructing a house.

The petitioner resided on the said land until 1984, after the

petitioner's 1st wife's separation, he came back to his parents but, he

continued to possess and cultivate the same and even though the

petitioner's father did not have a permit or a grant. The State

authorities and officials also had no objections for him and his father

cultivating and developing the land as they were to be alienated to

farmers in due course. He further submitted that in 2008 after the

4

death of the father, the 4th respondent succeeded to the petitioner's

father's lands and in the meantime the 4th respondent illegally

obtained a permit and claimed the land including lot Nos. 188 and

189.

The 4th respondent is a public servant attached to the Land

Commissioner's Department as a field officer. The original permit of

the 4th respondent is P15 but the said permit has been amended and

. marked as P34.

The petitioner submitted that the said permits issued to the 4th

respondent marked as P15 andP34 were illegal on the ground that

the said permits have been issued without holding a Land

Kachcheri which is required under Section 20 of the Land

Development Ordinance and the fact that the 4th respondent being a

public servant, he is not a fit and proper person to receive the above

described land under the Land Development Ordinance.

The Petitioner further submitted that the 1st Respondent, the

Divisional Secretary has admitted that there were no records in the

Divisional Secr~tariat pertaining to the permit issued to the 4th

respondent and P15 considered to be fraudulent.

5

The petitioner in this application is claiming a Writ of Certiorari

to quash the Permit P15 later amended as P34 issued to the 4th

respondent and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus to

issue a permit to the Petitioner under the Land Development

Ordinance in respect of lots 188 and 189 referred to in the plan

thereof.

The position of the 4th respondent is that he prays to set aside

the permit issued to him and claiming for a Writ of Mandamus to

issue the permit in the name of the 4th Respondent

It has been found that there were several serious irregularities

arose in the permit that had been issued to the 4th respondent. The

permit marked as P15 issued to the 4th Respondent in 2003 is in

respect of Lots 186 and 187.

Then in 2011 the Petitioner had attended the Land Kachcheri

under notification and requested a permit in respect of Lots 188 and

189marked as P20 and he has made some steps to get permit.

The 1st Respondent, the Divisional Secretary had cancelled the

permit which has been issued to the 4th Respondent in respect of lots

6

186 and 187 on the ground that the 4th respondent had not done any

development to the specified land.

But the 3rd Respondent, the Commissioner General of Lands

had found that the 4th Respondent had developed the specified land

and the 3rd Respondent had cancelled the decision of the 1st

Respondent then the 5th Respondent Minister of Lands and Land

Development had intervened in the matter and he had directed

initially to suspend the order of the 3rd Respondent, Commissioner

General of Lands but later he ordered and confirmed the decision of

the 3rd Respondent, the Commissioner General of Lands.

It has been noted that at the initial stage, permit P15 has been

issued to the 4th respondent for the lots 186 and 187 but later it had

been amended and marked as P34 and issued to the 4th respondent

for the lots 188 and 189. Those are the very lots in respect of which

the Petitioner had made application and attended a Land Kachcheri.

These facts are very clear and indicates that the original permit

is in respect of lots 188 and 189 were issued without a proper

inquiry and a Land Kachcheri. Further they have changed the lots

7

186 and 187 into 188 and 189 after the attendance of the petitioner for

the proper application to the permit.

Further, it is very clear that PIS, the initial permit had been

i~sued to the 4th Respondent without the Land Kachcheri which is a

mandatory requirement under Section 20 of the Land Development

Ordinance and where the 4th respondent was attached to the

Provincial Land Commissioner General Department as the field

officer.

Land Development Ordinance states that a permit only can be

issued to the persons who are below certain income and a permit

cannot be issued to a Public servant. It has been found there are

certain irregularities been followed in the issuance of t~e permit

PIS.

In terms of document marked as 'IRl', the permit has been

issued on approval given by the Provincial Authorities in 1994 and

that the Provincial Authorities do not have power to grant permit to

the 4th respondent.

PIS was issued on 2003 but on the face of PIS, it is a form

printed by the Government Printers in the year of 2005.

"

8

In accordance with Section 106 of the Land Development

Ordinance the 1st Respondent had cancelled the permit issued to the

4th Respondent by an ex-parte order marked as 1R3 stating that he

had failed to develop the land and this has been notified to the

Petitioner by document marked as P23.

It is important to be noted that in view of the document marked

as PS, the 1st Respondent, the Divisional Secretary has admitted that

the permit cannot be issued to the 4th Respondent under Land

Development Ordinance and also admitted in document marked P7

that the copies of the said permit or the ledger were not' available at

the Divisional Secretariat.

The permit issued to the 4th Respondent marked as P1S and

later amended as P34 were not followed the procedures and rules

which is mandatorily set out in the Land Development Ordinance

and issuance of a permit to a public servant is contrary to law and

the 4th Respondent cannot be claimed a permit to issue on his name

while being a public servant.

Considering the submissions made by the Counsel and the facts

and circumstances of this case, this Court allows to quashes the

9.

permit PIS, later amended as P34 which has been issued to the 4th

Respondent by way of a Writ of Certiorari and orders to hold a fresh

Land Kachcheri in respect of Lot Nos. 188 and 189 with the participation

of the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent.

This Court allows the application without Costs.
