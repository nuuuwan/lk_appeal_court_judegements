~ Written Submis3ions: Tendered by the Petitioner on 9th July 2018

Tendered by the Respondents on 13th July 2018

Decided on: 20th July 2018

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

iA) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to evict

the Petitioner from the land set out in the schedule to the pctition;l

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from evicting the

Pei itioncr from the 'and set out in the Schedule to the petition.

The Petitioner cJainls th:jt the JaLd in question, situated in Welimada, was

vested in the Sanitary Board of the Province of Uva by the then Governor of

Ceylon in terms of an order made in 1923 under Section '9L' of th(; Small

Towns Sanit~ry Ordinance No. 1[~ of 1892. The Petitioner has annexed to the

;.;etition, rr:z:rked 'Pl', an extract of the relevant folio Evidencing SJme.

According to the Petitioner, by operation of law, the said land had

subsequently vested in the Welimdda Town Council, the Badulla District

Development Council2 and the Welimada Pradeshiya Sabha 3

The Petitioner states that the Acting Secretary of the Badulla District

Development Council had executed a lease in respect of the said land in his

favour, a copy of which has been annexed to the petition marked 'P6'. The

Petitioner states that the said lease expired in 2011 and that the Welimadt:l

Pradeshiya SabhJ ;s in the process of executing a fresh lease in his favour.

T'le crux of the Petitioner's complaint to this Court is that the land belongs to

the Welimadil Pradeshiya Sabha and therefore, the 1st Respondent Divisional

Secretary is not the Competent Authority to institute procee"dings under the

provisions of the ~ tate L(Jnds (RecovEry of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, as

()rnended (the Act). On this bJsis, the Petit~oner claims that the decision of the

1st Respondent to i~~ue the Quit Notice lJnnexed to the petition marked 'P12' is

~

arbitrary and bad in law.

The ledrned State Cuunsel h2~ taken up the positivn that the Petitioner has no

entitlement to the said land and does not have a legal right to have and

maintain this Clpplication. Thi Court has examinf.d the lease agreement

marked 'PG' and note thut the period of the lease had expired on 30th June

2011. The Petitioner has produced severt.il letters to demonstrate that the

'vVelimada Fradeshiyt.1 Sabha has agreed to extend the said lease. By a letter

dated 26th October 2017,4 the vVelimada Pradeshiya Sabha had requested the

Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 2,476,110 being the lease rental due until 1st

November 2017 and that steps would be taken to execute a fresh lease

thereafter. However, the Petitioner has not produced any material to prove

that he h()s paid this sunl of money or that a fresh lease has been executed.

Thus, at this point of time, irrespectiVE: of who is the owner of the said land,

4 Annexed to the Counter AffidJvit of the PEt:tioner mdrked 'P1S', issue,.) after tLis

application was filed.

J

, the- J~<:etitiQner i~~ in unlawful occupation ()f .. th:~~ [and. -t:;i~ Court is therefore in

agreement with the :;ubmissioii cor the le;:~rned State Counsel that the

Petitioner has no legal right or standing to rnaintain this application.

The Respondents have denied the Petitioner's claim thiJt the land from whic.h

he is to be evicted belonged to the Sanitary Board of the Uva Province and

presently belongs to the Welimada PradeshiyJ Sabha. The Respondents state

that the rel~vant land forms part of the larger land depicted in Lot No. 75 of

Final Village Phn 517, in extent of 1 rood 24 perches anrl that the said land hurl

been acquired by the State on 8th June 1922, as reflected in the Register of

Settlements dated 4th June 1047, produced with the Statement of Objections

marked 'R~'. 'R1' does not reflect the Tact that this land had been vested in the

S~-lnitary Board. On this basis, the Respondents categorically st(Jte that the land

occupied by thf~ Petitioner is st2te land Zlnll that the 1st Respondent has the

power to issue the Quit Notice 'P~2'.

This Court notes that in terms of the extrCJct marked '.Pt', the total extent of

the land said to have been vested in the Sanitary Board is 1 rood 9.1 perches.

However, ~ccording to Plan No 1650 dated 12th Novernber 1986 annexed to

the petition marked 'P7' 2nd referred to in th(-~ le3se agreernent 'r6', the total

extent of land leased to the Petitioner is only 39 perches. Thus, there is a

discr pancy in the extent of land between 'Pi', 'P7' and 'R2'. No explanation

has been offered by the Petitioner with regard to this discrepancy. This Court

ulso notes that the western boundary in 'P1' does not t~lIy with the western

boundary set out in 'P7'. Thus, there appears to be a douLt with regard to the

identity of the I~nd.

The Petitioner has not established to the satisfaction of this Court that the land occupied by hinl is not state land. In these circumstances, thi~ Court has no

basis to hold that the land referred to in the Quit Notice annexed to the

petition marked 'P12' is not state land. This Court has consistently taken the

view that where the facts are disputed, this Court will not exercise its writ

jurisdiction. Therefore, the Petitioner's position that the 1st Respondent has

acted outside her jurisdiction in issuing the said quit notice is without any legal

basis.

This Court must note that the Petitioner has failed to name the Welimada

Pradeshiya Sabha or any of its office be(Jrers as a Respondent to this

application. If this Court is to look into the claim of thE; Petitioner that the land

belongs to the Welimada PradeshiyJ Sabha t.-nd the claim of the Petitioner that

a fresh lease was to be executed in his favour, the Petitioner ought to have

named the WclimJda Pradeshiya Sabha as J respondent to this application, <.lS

the Pradeshiya Sabha may have been able to shed more light on these issues

and produce the necessary documents including the vesting order said to have

been made by the Governor of Ceylon in favour of the Sanitary Board. This

Court is of the view that a failure to name as a respondent, a party necessary

for the effective determination of an application is fatal to the maintJinability

of the said application.

The Petitioner has claimed further that the 1st Respondent has acted in bad

faith on the influence of the Grama Niladhari, Welim3da Town. This Court

notes at the Gutset that the Petitioner has not named the said Grama Niladhari

as a party to this application nor has the Petitioner referred to the 1st

Respondent by nl.nne. This Court has consistently held thot whEre malice is

5

alleged, the relevant P<1rty rnust be referred to by name and made a party . .

Furthermore, details relating to the malicious conduct must be set out in the

petition. Mere iJlle~ations will not suffice. The Petitioner has done neither and

therefore, this Court is not inclined to consider the alleGw tions of malice.

On the basis of the above fuctuill positions, it is not difficult for this Court to

form the view thatlhe Petitioner h()s chosen an easy way out to possess this

land by invoking the jurisdiction of this Court instead of making the requisite

p<lyments. [)urine the argument, in re-:-ponse to a question rosed by this Court,

the Petitioner confirmed that he h<.1S not paid even a pdrt of the sum he had

been asked to pay. Thus, it appel:rs to this Court lha t the filing of this

application is an attempt on the part of the Petitioner to abuse the process cf

this Court.

Taking into r:on~idera tion c.d! cf the: above circumst2nces, this C.Jurt is of the

vie'IN that the application of the retit:oner is misconceivE:.;d in fact and in law.

Henr,, this Court :',ees no bdsi~ to exercise it:;; writ jurisdiction. The Application

of the PetitiGner i~ acc~)rdingly Jisniissed, without costs.
