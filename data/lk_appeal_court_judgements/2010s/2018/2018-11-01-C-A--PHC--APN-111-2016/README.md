This an application in revision made against the order of the learned High Court Judge of Puttalam

dated 12.07.2016.

This matter arises out of an information filed by the Officer-in-Charge of the Saliyawewa Police

under section 66(1)(a} of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act). Information was filed on

25.11.2014. The parties were permitted to file affidavits, counter affidavits and documents. The

1st Party-Petitioner-Petitioner (Petitioner) claimed that he was in possession of the land in

dispute from 17.03.2010 whereas the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) claimed

that he was in possession of the land in dispute for about 20 years.

The parties admitted that the land in dispute is depicted as "F" in the sketch filed by the Police.

(Journal Entry dated 25.11.2014).

The learned Magistrate held that the Respondent had established that he was in possession of

the land in dispute on the date that information was filed and that the Petitioner had failed to

establish the exact day on which he was evicted from the land in dispute by the Respondent.

Accordingly, he held that the Respondent was entitled to possession of the land in dispute.

The Petitioner moved in revision to the High Court against the said order. The learned High Court

Judge by his order dated 12.07.2016 dismissed the said application on the basis that the

Petitioner had failed to establish exceptional circumstances as well as him having an alternative

remedy. Hence this application in revision.

One of the main arguments of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that the land in dispute is

not properly identified. He submitted that whereas the land claimed by the Petitioner is identified

as Dangaha Kumbura the Respondents claimed a portion of land called Thambigewela. The

learned counsel for the Petitioner relied on Punchi Nona v. Padumasena and others [(1994}2

SrLL.R. 117]. However, as pointed out earlier, parties in the Magistrates Court admitted that the

land in dispute is depicted as "F" in the sketch filed by the Police. (Journal Entry dated

25.11.2014).

Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:

"No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree

to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to admit by any writing

under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed

to have admitted by their pleadings:

Provided that the court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved

otherwise than by such admissions."

Accordingly, an admission can be made in the following ways:

(i) Where the parties or their agents agree to admit a fact at the hearing;

(ii) Where before the hearing, parties agree to admit a fact by any writing under their

hands;

(iii) Where, by any rule of pleading in force at the time the parties are deemed to have

admitted a fact by their pleadings.

The admission in the instant case as to the identity of the land in dispute was one made within

(i) above. An admission of fact made by counsel is binding on the client [Coomaraswamy, The

Law of Evidence, Vol. I, page 129]. It is sometimes permissible to withdraw admissions on

questions of law but admissions on questions of fact cannot be withdrawn [Uvais v. Punyawathie

(1993) 2 SrLL.R. 46]. However, in Sivaratnam and others v. Dissanayake and others [(2004) 1

SrLL.R. 144 at 148] Amaratunga J. sought to explain the principle as follows:

liThe decision in Uvais v Punyawathie (supra) is authority for the proposition that a fact

specifically admitted at the trial and relied on by the opposite party in deciding how he

should present his case cannot be withdrawn or departed from at the stage of the appeal.

See also Mariammai v. Pethurupillal. Fernando, J.IS judgment in Uvaisls case makes it very

clear that what is not permitted is the withdrawal of an admission in circumstances where

such withdrawal has the effect of subverting the fundamental principles of the Civil

Page 3 of 6

Procedure Code in regard to pleadings and issues. That judgment is not authority for the

broader proposition that an admission once made cannot be withdrawn at all. An

admission made in a written statement may be subsequently withdrawn with the

permission of the Judge. Muhammad Altof All Khan v Hamid-ud-din. Section 183 proviso

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 explicitly demonstrates that an

admission can be withdrawn. Thus, the law's refusal to allow the withdrawal of an

admission is a matter depending on the circumstances of each case."

In the present case, no attempt was made to withdraw the admission as to the identity of the

corpus either in the Magistrate's Court or the High Court. Accordingly, I am of the view that the

Petitioner cannot now be permitted to do so and argue that the identity of the corpus is in issue.

In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [(1982) 2 SrLL.R. 693 at 698] Sharvananda J. (as he was then)

stated as follows:

"In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land, where a breach of peace is

threatened or is likely under Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the main point

for decision is the actual possession of the land on the date of the filing of the information

under section 66, but where forcible dispossession took place within two months before

the date on which the said information was filed the main point is actual possession prior

to the alleged date of dispossession."

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the documents tendered by the

Respondent does not establish that he was in possession of the land in dispute. However, the

learned Magistrate has correctly concluded that the evidence tendered on behalf of the

Respondent does in fact establish his possession of the land in dispute whereas the Petitioner

has failed to do so.

In this regard an important item of evidence is the document marked 20::>1 which is a certified

copy of the proceedings in D.C. Puttalam 2109/L which has been filed on 18.12.2013, more than

a year prior to information been filed under section 66(1)(a) of the Act, by the Respondent and 5

others against one Ferdinandusz and LB. Newton Pieris. The plaintiffs claimed that they were in

Page 4 of 6

possession of the land in dispute and sought inter alia a declaration that they are entitled to

possess the said land and preventing the defendants evicting them from the said land. The

defendants were two of the vendors who had purportedly sold the land in dispute to the

Petitioner. This is an important fact which establishes that the Respondent was in possession of

the land in dispute at least one year prior to the date when information was filed. The Petitioner

failed to establish that he took over possession of the land in dispute thereafter.

On a careful reading of the evidence, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge correctly

concluded that there are no exceptional circumstances to interfere with the assessment of the

evidence made by the learned Magistrate.

The Petitioner having moved the High Court by way of revision had a right of appeal to this court

against the order of the learned High Court Judge of Puttalam dated 12.07.2016. However, he

has filed a revision application instead of an appeal. In Dharmaratne and another v. Palm Paradise

Cabanas ltd. and others [(2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 24 at 30] Amaratunga J. held:

"Thus the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court selects

the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary method of rectification should be

adopted. If such a selection process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will

become a gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision

application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given right of

appeal.

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the

exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got hardened into

a rule which should not be lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not

indicate that it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice'."

There are no exceptional circumstances, which justifies this Court exercising the extraordinary

powers of revision against the order of the learned High Court Judge of Puttalam dated

12.07.2016.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000/=.
