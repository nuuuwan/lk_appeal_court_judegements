After trial the learned High Court Judge acquitted appellants on the

1st to. 7th COl mts,.cotUlictecLtha appellants .cm-8!'!..to-tJl.h .. counts-and

imposed a term of 15 years RI each. Imposed death sentence on the 11th

count. Imposed of a term of 17 years RI for the 12th and 13th counts and

ordered to run the sentence consecutively. The second accused was

acquitted on all the counts.

This appeal is from the said sentence and the conviction. The

grounds of appeal can be summarized as follows.

1. Whether the learned High Court Judge correctly analysed the

evidence of the sole eye witness.

2. Whether the evidence of identification given by sole eye witness

was satisfactory with regard to each of the appellants.

3. Whether the learned High Court Judge considered each

appellant's evidence separately before rejecting their evidence.

4. Whether the learned trial Judge in acquitting the appellant on

unlawful assembly based on charges correctly considered the

concept of liability under common intention with regard to each

appellants.

According to the evidence of the sale eye witness, on the fateful

day, he along with a group of his friends had played a game of cricket at

the Lunawa Primary School playground in the evening.

After conclusion of the said game around 6 p.m. they had been

--- -talking to each other outside the said playground until 7.30 p.m .. Then

Prosecution Witness No.3 Mahinda had come with a musical instrument

4

,~~~------------------I I I t 1 I 1

(~~) accompanied by one Suren and had engaged in a sing - song

which lasted till about 9.30 p.m. There had been a power cut in force at

that pOinfor-trme.ineeye-wlfnesssayS"tnaf P"rosecutfonWlfneSs" Roy

Pradeep Kumara to'o was with them.

The witness says that Mahinda went to get some cannabis (G)od)

and he walked about 185 feet towards the middle of the playground as

he does not smoke in the presence of the deceased and from there he

had observed a white coloured van approaching the crowd and the crowd

ran away leaving behind the deceased.

When Prosecution Witness No. 1 went towards the said van he had

seen a group of about 10 people inside the van and they had alighted

from the van and assaulted and put the witness and the deceased inside

the van. Under cross examination the eye witness testified that after the

van came to a halt another group of about 4-5 people armed with

weapons had come from different directions and he could not identify

them as it has pitch dark.

Out of the people who arrived in the said van the witness had

m Identlfieatfle flrsf anaslxtfl accLlsed. fr appears trom msevidencEf that

the first and sixth appellants were known people. He says that the head

lamps of the van were glowing and those two were identified with the aid

of the light shedding from the said head lamps (vide page 170 of the

brief).

The first appellant was identified by the witness in the dock whilst

giving evidence but the sixth appellant was not identified in court. The

5 II

witness refers to the sixth appellant as "Susil" whereas his name reflected

in the indictment is Bamunu Handige Sumanasiri Peiris.

It appears from the evidence of the eye witness that the person

called "Susil" uttered the words (ep @rn MeJ:> @rn ~~) which

voice identification cannot be attributed to the sixth appellant. As the sixth

appellant was not identified in the dock, the rest of the findings against

him will have no bearing on him and therefore he is entitled to an acquittal

on that score alone.

I again tum to the evidence of the eye witness. The witness further

testified that Roy Pradeep Kumara too was put inside the van and he

noticed that he was bleeding in his legs. But does not say under what

light he has identified.

The witness says that when he was put inside the vehicle there

were about five people in the same, whereas he initially said that about

10 (vide page 170 of the brief) people alighted from the said van. The

witness further says that first and fifth appellants tried to stab him but he

-~I'ldef-wilaHightAe:-FesegnisedthosaappsllantsL He further

says that the deceased was grappling with the people inside the van and

the deceased assaulted the first appellant but does not say that a light

was burning inside the van.

The witness says that the sixth appellant had driven the van a

distance about 500 meters towards Lunawa and after stopping the said

van they had dragged three of them to a bare land owned by the sixth

appellant and the sixth appellant inquired as to who had set fire to a van

6

(vide page 179 of the brief). The witness does not say as to whether there

was any light available in the said bare land.

The witness further says that at the said bare land he was held by

the sixth appellant and the fifth appellant cut him but does not say with

what instrument. He testified that he was forced to lie on the ground and

the fifth appel/ant dealt a blow with a sward which severed his right arm.

Unfortunately he does not say under what light he observed this incident.

The witness further testified that he saw the deceased about 1 %

feet away from him and the deceased was attacked by the third and fourth

appellants. Again the question arises under what light this incident was

observed by the eye witness. The evidence shows that the acts alleged

to have done by the third appellant is restricted to the assault to the

deceased.

It was the evidence of the witness that after assaulting him and the

deceased they were dumped in a three wheeler and taken towards

Lunawa Hospital at which pOint the witness has jumped out of the three

m ---:wbeelerand!hereafte!c:~~admitted-tohospitaLb some people. The

counsel for all the appellants argued that the identification of the

appellants have not been established by the prosecution.

On a perusal of the evidence it is evident that the identification has

not been established. The sole eye witness has not mentioned under

what light he identified the appellants. When there is only one eye witness

his evidence has to be cogent and reliable. The prosecution has failed to

establish how the appel/ants were identified by the eye witness.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the identification

are of two fold, the physical identification and voice identification. On a

careful reading of the evidence of the sole eye witness the voice

identification refers to two lines to the effect "(ffJ ~ ~ ~ ~o

~ 0)000)" whjch is not sufficient to establish voice identification.

We find that since the main ingredient has not been proved the

prosecution case has collapsed. The learned High Court Judge had

misdirected himself when he obselVed that the identification has been

proved.

In view of the above findings the conviction can not be allowed to

stand and accordingly we decide to set aside the conviction and the

sentence.

Appeal allowed.
