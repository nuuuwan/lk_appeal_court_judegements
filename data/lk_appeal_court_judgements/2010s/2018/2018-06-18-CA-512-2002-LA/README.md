Samayawardhena, J.

The Last Will was declared proved and admitted to probate. The

Probate was issued jointly to the three original petitioners.

Thereafter, the 3rd original petitioner and the intervenient

petitioner made applications by way of petition and affidavit under

section 537 of the Civil Procedure Code to recall the Probate

already issued alleging various grounds and to issue the same in

the name of both of them. The 1st and 2nd petitioners filed

objections to this application but did not participate at the inquiry

and the Court on 28.01.2000 allowed the said application of the 3rd

petitioner and the intervenient petitioner ex parte. Thereupon the

1st and 2nd petitioners filed an application on 23.07.2001 seeking

to set aside the said ex parte order dated 28.01.2000 and to recall

the Probate issued jointly to the 3rd petitioner and the intervenient

petitioner and to issue the same in the name of the 1st and 2nd

petitioners. The 3rd petitioner and the intervenient petitioner filed

objections to that application and after the inquiry concluded by

way of written submissions, the District Court by order dated

20.11.2002 refused the application of the 1st and 2nd petitioners. It

is against this order the 1st and 2nd petitioners filed this appeal

with leave obtained.

The District Judge has basically refused the application of the 1st

and 2nd petitioners on the premise that without first making an

application to purge default, they cannot seek any substantive

relief. That order, in my view, is flawless.

Whether the procedure is regular or summary, it is well settled law

that a default judgment or order cannot be canvassed on merits

before the District Court or before this Court on appeal (unless the

defaulter first purges default). The only exception is a revision

5

application filed before this Court. (Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake

v. Times of Ceylon Limited1, Arumugam v. Kumaraswamy2 ) Here

the portion "unless the defaulter first purges default" was added

within brackets for the purpose of better understanding the

principle, but in fact, that part is redundant because if the

defaulter is successful in purging default, the judgment or order

will automatically be set aside regardless of its merits.

There cannot be any dispute that the 1st and 2nd petitioners in

their application dated 23.07.2001 did not plead in the prayer to

purge their default, but pleaded to set aside the ex parte order on

merits.

It is the submission of the 1st and 2nd petitioners that the earlier

order of the District Court dated 28.01.2000 is per incuriam

because the summary procedure as stipulated in section 538 of

Civil Procedure Code has not been followed when recalling the

Probate and therefore the question of purging default does not

arise as a per incuriam order is a nullity ab initio.

It is noteworthy that the 1st and 2nd petitioners did not take up

such a position in their objections filed before the District Court

prior to the said order dated 28.01.2000 was made. Their

objections were based on the merits of the matter and not on the

procedure. They took up such a position for the first time in their

application dated 23.7.2001 made more than 1 years after

making the first order.

Unlike in a situation where there is patent or total want of

jurisdiction, when the Court has plenary jurisdiction to deal with a

matter and the question is invoking such jurisdiction in the right

manner, a party cannot keep silent and take up such an objection

as to procedure, if the final order is made against him. That is

against the law and against common sense. Any objection as to

latent or contingent want of jurisdiction shall be taken at the first

available opportunityvide section 39 of the Judicature Act, No.

32 of 1978, as amended. (Navaratnasingham v. Arumugam3) Long

silence in that context amounts to waiver or acquiescence. (Ranin

Kumar, Proprietor, Messrs Pharma Chemie v. State Pharmaceutical

Corporation4)

It is only if want of jurisdiction is patent, the matter can be raised

at anytime, even for the first time in appeal, and in which event,

the whole proceedings including the Judgment pronounced

become a nullity ab initio due to coram non judice. Parties cannot

confer jurisdiction to Court where none exists, and no amount of

silence or acquiescence can cure that defect. (Beatrice Perera v.

The Commissioner of National Housing5, Colombo Apothecaries Ltd.

v. Commissioner of Labour6, Ittepana v. Hemawathie7, State Timber

Corporation v. Moiz Goh Pte Ltd8, Malegoda v. Joachim9)

In Dabare v. Appuhamy10 the defendants objection to dismiss the

plaintiffs action on res judicata was overruled. On appeal by the

defendant, the plaintiff submitted that the dismissal of his former

action was invalid as the judge in the former case followed the

wrong procedure in that instead of summary procedure, regular

procedure was followed. At that time, the plaintiff had not taken

objection to the wrong procedure being followed. This Court

rejecting that argument and allowing the appeal stated that

notwithstanding the former judge had followed the wrong

procedure, the order of dismissal made by him was valid since he

had jurisdiction to hear and determine the action and the plaintiff

did not take objection to the wrong procedure being followed at

that time.

Hence the submission of the 1st and 2nd petitioners that the former

order dated 28.01.2000 is a nullity as the proper procedure was

not followed is not entitled to succeed.

In any event, the reason why the 1st and 2nd petitioners say that

the summary procedure was not followed is that the 3rd petitioner

and the intervenient petitioner did not obtain an order nisi in the

first instance and have the same served on the 1st and 2nd

petitioners.

There is no compulsion to obtain order nisi under summary

procedure as section 377 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for

either obtaining (a) an order nisi or (b) an interlocutory order

appointing a day for the determination of the matter. Here the

Court has acted under (b) above even though it does not expressly

state so.

The next question is whether it is mandatory to serve the said

order on the 1st and the 2nd petitioners as stated in section 379 of

the Civil Procedure Code. After the application was supported in

open Court, the Attorney at Law of the 1st and 2nd petitioners had

moved for a date to file objections and did file the same on a

subsequent date. Seeking for an adjournment to file written

objections in that backdrop is not obnoxious to the summary

procedure. (Rajenda v. Parakramas Ltd11) Under those

circumstances, there is no compulsion to go through the

prescribed formality and serve a copy of the order on the 1st and

2nd petitioners. (Amarasinghe v. Weeratna12)

Another complaint of the 1st and 2nd petitioners is that no notice

was served on them before the matter was fixed for the inquiry.

This is absolutely not necessary. After the objections were filed

they should know that the next step would be the inquiry, and it is

incumbent on their part, being the original petitioners as well as

the probate holders, to keep track of the case not only to oppose

this application for recalling the Probate, but also to take

mandatory steps including presentment of the Final Account in

accordance with law.

If the respondent does not appear on the date of the inquiry, the

Court can, in terms of section 383 of the Civil Procedure Code,

make the final order. The respondent in that event can, in terms

of section 389 of the Civil Procedure Code, make an application

within a reasonable time after passing of such order to purge

default. No such application has been made by the 1st and the

2nd petitioners.

The application of the 1st and 2nd petitioners dated 23.07.2001 is

misconceived in law. The impugned order of the District Judge

dated 20.11.2002 is correct. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
