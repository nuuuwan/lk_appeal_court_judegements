The accused appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

appellant) was indicted for soliciting a sum of Rs. 40,000/= between the

period of 02.10.2002 to 11.10.2002 from one Kumudu Kumari for taking

steps to discharge one Ajith Kumara from a case in Magistrate's Court in

Maligakanda under section 16 (b) of the Bribery Act. He was also charged

under section 19 (c) of the said Act for soliciting a sum of Rs. 40,0001=

from the said Kumadu Kumari during the course of the same transaction

while being a public servant.

After trial the appellant was convicted on both charges and

sentenced to a term of 3 years of imprisonment for each count to run

concurrently. This appeal is from the said conviction and the sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that when Prosecution Witness No.

1 Kumudu Kumari visited her brother on 30.09.2002 in tt1~!e'!lan~~son.

she was given a copy of the Government Analyst Report by one Piyadasa

and was told that it is a negative report and that he could be released if

i j ,

\ she met the appellant. She has gone to meet the appellant on 01.10.2002

and the appellant has promised to help her to get the brother released

from charges for a sum of Rs. 100,0001=. However the said amount had

been reduced to Rs. 40,0001= after bargaining.

The witness has testified that although the said report was a

negative report the Magistrate has called for a finger print report and the

appellant solicited a sum of Rs. 40,0001= for the purpose of submitting

the said report to court.

The appellant has suggested that to facilitate the process the case

to be called by a motion on the 04.10.2002 but the witness had not been

able to find the money by 04.10.2002. When she met the appellant in

court he had asked whether she brought the money and she had told him

that she will find the money before the next calling date. Thereafter she

has complained to the Bribery Commission and a raid was organized on

the 09.10.2002.

The team sent by the said Commission had included Prosecution

Witness No.4 and No.5. Prosecution Witness No.1 has gone with the

decoy and had met the appellant, the appellant had asked her to wait

near the canteen. According to Prosecution Witness No.1 the appellant

has felt suspicious of the decoy (Prosecution Witness No.4) and had

asked the witness to bring the money on the 11 th of October on which

date the case was to be called. However the Bribery Commission has not

pursued the matter thereafter.

-------~---------'-----------------------------

..

The appellant whilst giving evidence under oath has admitted that

he met Kumudu Kumari on few occasions and discussed about her

brother's case and ways of getting him released. He has not admitted

soliCiting a sum of Rs. 40,000/=. Therefore the only matter in dispute is

the fact as to whether the appellant solicited the said sum of Rs. 40,000/=.

According to Kumudu Kumari the solicitation has taken place on

the 01 st of October which falls outside the period referred to in the

indictment. The learned counsel for the appellant a~gued that the

Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is only a natration of evidence

and that the evidence had not been analyzed and the Learned High Court

Judge has failed in his duty.

On a perusal of the judgment we find that he has merely narrated

the evidence given before him and has failed to analyse the evidence.

Further the evidence of the main prosecution witness is not cogent and

not consistent.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to set aside the judgment

dated 29.01.2008 and allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.
