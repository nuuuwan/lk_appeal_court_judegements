T

his case quintessentially raises the question of proof of paternity and poses the

issue / is birth certificate the only made of proof of a person's birth? The whole

case revolves around one M.G. Piyasena alias Horathala who, the Plaintiff/Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff"), has asserted right throughout the

trial and argument before this Court, was the father of Merayal Gedara N andawathie/

the plaintiff's predecessor in title. It is the plaintiff's assertion that since her

predecessor in title/Nandawathie inherited one half of the property through Horathala,

Nandawathie passed good title to the Plaintiff. On the other hand another daughter of

Horathala/the tt Defendant Karunawathie claims that Horathala (her father) did not

father Nandawathie. In other words the 1st Defendant/Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the 1st Defendant") has consistently argued that the Plaintiff

did not get her title to the property in question because the plaintiff's predecessor

Nandawathie was not a daughter of Horathala at all.

In other words the 1st Defendant (Karunawathie) has asserted that Nandawathie (the

plaintiff's predecessor) is not her sister by consanguinity and as such Nandawathie

could not have passed title to the Plaintiff/Appellant. That position of the tt Defendant

is to advance the position that the 1st Defendant alone inherited the property from the

father figure/ Horathala and she remained the owner until she transferred her own title

to the 2nd Defendant.

So in the end the case presented to the learned District Judge of Kandy focused around

the paternity of the plaintiff's predecessor/Nandawathie. Was Nandawathie (the

Plaintiff's predecessor in title) the daughter of Horathala? Or was he the father of only

Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) as Karunawathie has averred? Or were Nandawathie

2

and Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) children of Horathala? Were they in fact

consanguine sisters? These are the issues that arise in this case. If they are in fact

consanguine sisters, they would become co~owners of the property left to them by

Horathala and if not, Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) alone would inherit the

property.

Did the Plaintiff establish on a balance of probabilities that her predecessor~

Nandawathie was indeed a child of Horathala? The learned District Judge of Kandy in

his judgment dated 04.04.1997 has dismissed the plaintiff's action holding inter alia that

the Plaintiff has not established that Horathala was the father of her predecessor~

Nandawathie. No birth certificate of Nandawathie was produced by the Plaintiff.

Neither was the marriage certificate of Nandawathie's mother and Horathala produced

at the trial. So the paternity was in doubt and the fact that Horathala fathered N andawathie was not

established~this was the reasoning of the learned District Judge.

The Plaintiff~Appellant has appealed against the judgment and revolving around this

factual matrix, one has to turn to evidence that has been led on the part of the Plaintiff

to ascertain whether the paternity of Horathala in relation to Nandawathie has been

established.

The issue, as encapsulated above, is whether Nandawathie (the plaintiff's predecessor)

is the daughter of Horathala. There were items of relevant evidence that were relied

upon by the Plaintiff~Respondent to establish that Nandawathie (the plaintiff's

predecessor) was in fact the daughter of Horathala. These items of evidence can now be

gone into.

M.G. Piyasena alias Horathala whom both Nandawathie and Karunawathie claim as

father became the owner of the property in dispute by a Deed of Transfer bearing No.

1403 and dated 10.02.1949. He had possessed the contiguous lands depicted in

Schedules A and B.

The Plaintiff giving evidence stated that she knew Nandawathie as a child of Horathala,

as she had lived in the same village. According to the witness, Horathala treated both

3

Nandawathie and Karunawathie as his daughters. Both went to school together as

sisters. In fact, Nandawathie was the daughter of his 2nd wife.

The plaintiff's predecessor/Nandawathie testified next: she emphasized that Horathala

treated her as his daughter and at no stage did her father tell her that she was not his

daughter. When this witness was cross/examined, this position was not challenged.

The defence never suggested to her that Horathala was not her father nor was it

suggested to her in cross/examination that she was somebody else's daughter. In fact, I

must observe that both Ganawathie (the Plaintiff) and Nandawathie (the plaintiff's

predecessor) spoke to the conduct of Horathala. In fact this conduct of Horathala is

indicative of his opinion that Nandawathie was not anyone but his daughter. This

evidence is relevant and admissible under Section 50 of the Evidence Ordinance which

states as follows:/

"When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the

opinion, expressed by conduct, as the existence of such relationship of any person who, as a

member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant

fact:

a) The question is, whether A and B were married. The fact that they were usually received

and treated by their friends as husband and Wife is relevant.

b) The question is, whether A was the legitimate son of B. The fact that A was always

treated as such by members of the family is relevant."

Another witness who was summoned to give evidence for the Plaintiff was one

Gamagedara Nondoris who was 72 years of age at the time of giving evidence.

There is abundant testimony from this witness that Piyasena alias Horathala had two

children namely Nandawathie (plaintiff's predecessor) and Karunawathie (the 1st

Defendant) who were both acknowledged as his daughters. I have already adverted to

Section 50 of the Evidence Ordinance which impinges on opinions of relationship. The

4

illustration (b) to Section 50 is to the effect that if a child was treated by a person as his

son, it would amount to legitimacy and is relevant.

In Wijesekera v. Welivitigoda 61 N.LR. 133, the question for decision was whether C

was of the lawful issue of a valid marriage contracted between A and B. The evidence

that during the lifetime of A his relatives regarded C as his legitimate child and

conducted themselves accordingly towards her was admissible under Section 50 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

The opinion must be of a person who as a member of the family or the person must have

special means of knowledge on the subject. Members and friends of the family will be

presumed to have special means of knowledge of the relationship and their conduct

would be an important factor in determining the relationship.

The head note to the case of Cooray v. Wijesuriya 62 N.LR. 158 states the following:

"Apart from proof by the production of birth, death and marriage certificates, the relevant

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to proof of a pedigree are to be found in sections

32(5), 32(6) and 50 (2) of the Evidence Ordnance."

Sinnetamby J. (with whom Basnayake, C.J concurred) stated at page 161:

"It almost always happens that birth and death certificates of persons who havedied very long

ago are not available; in such cases the only way of establishing relationship is by hearsay

evidence."

Whilst Sections 32(5) and 32(6) are exceptions to hearsay evidence, Section 50(2)

contains an exception to the exclusionary rule on opinion evidence.

It is to be noted that Section 50 differs from Section 32(5) in the following respects:~

(a) What is admissible under Section 32(5) is the statement giving the opinion

of a deceased person or a person who cannot be produced, whereas under

Section 50, the relevant fact is the opinion of persons, alive or dead,

expressed by conduct, the qualification of special means of knowledge being

common to both provisions.

5

(b) Under Section 32( 5), the statement must be made ante litem motam, but under

Section 50 the opinion may have been expressed before or after the

controversy arose.

In this case the birth certificate of Nandawathie (the plaintiff's predecessor) was not

produced. But yet the opinion of Horathala manifested by his conduct in

acknowledging her as his daughter was adduced. This was certainly admissible under

Section 50(2) of the Evidence Ordinance /one of the sections which make opinion

evidence admissible.

I must state this stage that the relevant evidence that was led of the conduct of

Horathala has not been rebutted and therefore the conduct is probative of the fact that

Nandawathie was the daughter of Horathala.

Deed of Mortgage

A Deed of Mortgage (PH) was produced wherein both Nandawathie and

Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) stated that they had inherited the subject/matter

from Horathala. In fact the 1st Defendant admitted the execution of this deed in cross/

examination (see page 92 of the brief). By way of P12, both Nandawathie and

Karunawathie partitioned the land into two portions. The documents PH and P12

connote that Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) held Nandawathie out as Horathala's

daughter and her sister. Apart from the fact that this is conduct manifesting an opinion

thus becoming admissible under Section 50, the fact that Karunawathie (the 1st

Defendant) joined Nandawathie (the plaintiff's predecessor) as a co/mortgagor in PH

unambiguously establishes her admission that Nandawathie is a daughter of Horathala.

In fact that Deed of Mortgage (PH) recited that N andawathie (the plaintiff's

predecessor) and the 1st Defendant/Karunawathie were owners of the land that was

being mortgaged, owing to a devolution on them through paternal inheritance. In other

words the 1st Defendant/Karunawathie conceded in the mortgage bond that Horathala

was the father of Nandawathie, inasmuch as he fathered her.

6

Horathala whose paternity of Nandawathie was denied at the trial by Karunawathie

had passed away at the time of trial. But it was established at the trial that

Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) joined Nandawathie in executing the aforesaid

mortgage of the land in question.

This mortgage speaks volumes. Both Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) and

Nandawathie (the plaintiff's predecessor) admit in the Deed of Mortgage bearing No.

6799 and dated 09.08.1974 that they are both entitled to the land uponan inheritance

from their father Horathala. The Sinhala version of the relevant assertion in the deed is

more specific as to the paternal inheritance of Horathala~the father flowing to both

mortgagors: "1n'-'tlO ctoC:> er@ld OO)~ eDl;8G>'-' @5)oO)@ @~cl ~CSA'35

COZ;'-'D er~ ............ "

Karunawathie admitted the execution of the mortgage bond along with Nandawathie.

She identified the signatures of both. This Court has to take cognizance of this

mortgage bond as one of the important items of evidence to determine Nandawathie's

status as a child of Horathala. By joining Nandawathie as one of the joint mortgagors to

the deed, Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) made an informal admission that Horathala

fathered Karunawathie. This assertion in the deed becomes relevant under Section 17(1)

of the Evidence Ordinance -a provision which enacts the 1st exception to the rule

against hearsay in the Sri Lankan Evidence Ordinance.

This statement of Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) in the mortgage bondto the above

effect~ "that both Nandawathie and she are from the same loins" is an out of court

statement which is prohibited as hearsay. But a hearsay statement is admitted into

evidence if there are exceptions to the exclusionary rule and apart from Section 17(1)

which defines an admission in a civil case, there are also other exceptions that would

render the admission in the mortgage bond relevant.

When the deed was marked as PH and Karunawathie admitted the contents of PH

(vide pages 90 and 92 of the appeal brief), these items of evidence became admissible as

an exception to the hearsay rule under Sections 17(1) and 21 of the Evidence Ordinance.

7

The effect then of the deed PH is that its assertion can be relied upon for the truth

thereof -namely Horathala was Nandawathie's father. There are other items of evidence

that strengthen the argument based on admissions. Karunawathie admitted that the

deed was prepared by the notary in accordance with the instructions given by them.

The lawyer read out the contents and explained them to her before she signed the deed.

Her husband signed as a witness. In the circumstances one is confronted with an

admission within the ambit of Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The trial Judge can use this statement to rely upon its truth namely Nandawathie is

also a daughter of Horathala, because Section 21 renders it provable against the maker

of the statement~Karunawathie.

Sections 17(1) and 21 of the Evidence Ordinance which go hand in hand lay down the

definition of an admission and its relevancy and admissibility as follows:~

"An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact

in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons, and under the

circumstance hereinafter mentioned "/Section 17 (1).

Admissions are relevant and may be proved against the person who makes them, or his

representative in interest... ................ Section 21

It is not every admission that is made relevant and admissible. Section 17(1) is

prescriptive of certain category of persons who should make the admissions in defined

circumstances. Admissions may be made in the first instance by a party himself, or it

may be an admission falling into one of the categories of vicarious admissions. Sections

18 and 19 of the Evidence Ordinance indicate the persons by whom an admission must

be made.

The relevant provision is Section 18 which lays down five classes of persons who can

make admissions, namely;

(l) A party to the proceeding,

(2) An authorized agent such party

8

(3) Party suing or sued in representative character (while holding such character)

(4) Persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject,

matter of the proceeding (during the continuance of such interest).

(5) Persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the

subject,matter of the suit (during the continuance of such interest).

In my view the admission made by Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) in the deed of

mortgage would amount to an admission she made against her proprietary interest in

the property in terms of Section 18(3)(a) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Statements made by (i) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the

subject,matter of the proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of

persons so interested; or (ii) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived

their interest in the subject,matter of the suit, are admissions if they are made during

the continuance of the interest of the persons making the statements.

When several persons are jointly interested in the subject,matter of a suit, an

admission of anyone of these persons is receivable not only against himself but also

against the other defendants, whether they be all jointly suing or sued, provided that

the admission relates to the subject,matter in dispute and be made by the declarant in

his character of a person jointly interested with the party against whom the evidence is

tendered. The three essential characteristics under this subsection are the joint

proprietary or pecuniary interest, the making of the statement, in the character of a

person so interested, and during the continuance of the interest. The requirement of the

identity in the legal interest is of fundamental importance' Amber Ali v. Lutfe Ali

(1918) A.I.R Cal 971; Sohan La] v. Gulab Chand A.I.R 1966 Raj 229.

Thus the pith and substance of my reasoning is as follows: Admissions under Section 17

go under the rubric of informal admissions as they are made outside Court but tendered

in evidence later in the trial. In this case the mortgage bond PH made outside Court but

tendered in evidence against the 1st Defendant contains an admission on the part of the

1st Defendant along with Nandawathie that Nandawathie is Horathala's daughter. It is a

9

relevant admission against Karunawathie~the maker of that admission under Section

18(3)(a) of the Evidence Ordinance. Admissions, oral or documentary must admit to a

fact in issue or relevant fact. Here the fact in issue was the paternity of Horathala over

Nandawathie namely was it Horathala who fathered her? Certainly the admission in

the deed by the 1st Defendant~Karunawathie is relevant to the fact in issue. It may be

proved against her under Section 21.

It is made relevant under Section 18(3)(a) because whoever makes an admission against

her proprietary interest must be uttering the truth. Had Karunawathie had been the

sole owner of this property, she could have mortgaged the entire property on her own.

But instead she joined Nandawathie acknowledging her as having an interest in the

land tracing it to paternal interest from Horathala. This shows that Karunawathie was

holding Nandawathie out as Horathala's daughter.

Effect of an Admission~Section 31 of the Evidence Ordinance

The effect of an admission is clearly set out in Section 31 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 31 is to the effect that admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters

admitted, but they may operate as estoppels under Sections 115~ 117. In other words the

person, who made the admission, may show that what she said was not true or that she

made a mistake~see Amritlal Narsilal v. Sadashive AI.R (1944) Bom.233; Mst. Munia

v. Manohar La] (1941) 194 I.C 161; Ram Jiwan v. Hanuman Prasad AI.R (1940)

Oudh.409.

The maker of the statement is at liberty to contradict it. Indian cases have gone to the

extent of holding that an admission, unless explained away, may shift the onus of

proof~see Rahmat Ali Sha v. Harbhajan Singh 223 I.C505; Bhag Singh v. Jai Singh

(1929) 116 I.C903; 10 Lah.694; Narayanan Bhagwant Rao v. Gopal AI.R (1960)

S.C100. In a domestic context, Gratiaen,j. held:

"An admission does not create a conclusive estoppel; it merely suggests an inference which a

court of trial may properly take into account and the Weight to be attached to it in any

10

particular case depends on many considerations."/see Rev. MoragoUe Sumangala v. Rev.

Kiribamune Piyadassi (1955) 56 N.LR 322 at 326.

So it was open to Karunawathie to contradict this evidence but instead she concurred

in full force with the terms of the mortgage bond. Admissions are not conclusive proof

of the facts admitted and may be explained or shown to be wrong. But they may raise

an estoppel and shift the burden of proof on to the person making them or his

representative in interest. Unless shown or explained to be wrong they are an

efficacious proof of the facts admitted/see A vadh Kishore v. Ram Gopal AI.R 1979 se

861; see also United India Insurance Co. Ltd, v. Samir Chandra Chaudhary (2005) 5 see 784, 787 (para 11).

In my view an admission is the best evidence that an opposite party can rely on and

though not conclusive is decisive of the matter unless successfully withdrawn or

proved erroneous.

So if the admission in the mortgage bond is not rebutted by cogent evidence which has

in any way not been led, Section 21 renders the admission provable against

Karunawathie.

An admission contained in a registered deed of adoption formerly executed by a party

with an endorsement showing that the executant was fully aware of the contents of the

deed and was executed with due deliberation and full understanding is conclusive

unless it is explained satisfactorily. The admission of an adoption in a deed amounts to

an admission both of the fact and of the validity of the adoption and shifts the burden

of proving the contrary to the party which made that admission/see Bhola v. Man

Matin AI.R 1965 All 258; Sooratha v. Kanaka AI.R 1920 Mad 648; Govinda v.

Chimabai AI.R 1968 Mys 309 .

I must state in passing that an admission which remains uncontradicted may also

operate as an estoppel/see Section 31 of the Evidence Ordinance. let me make a few

observations on estoppel before I part with this judgment.

11

Estoppel~Rule of Evidence

An estoppel, i.c., a representation acted on by the other party, by creating a substantive

right, does oblige the estopped party to make good his representation, in other words,

it is conclusive. The maker of the admission would be precluded from going back on it

based on the principle of estoppel if the person to whom it is made has acted on its

faith~see Narayan Neelakutti v. Krishnan Veki A.I.R 1955 TC 199; Bhattacharjee v.

Sentinel Assurance Co. Ltd, A.I.R 1955 Cal 594. Does this admission of Karunawathie

operate an estoppel? For that argument to be sustained, it must be shown that

Nandawathie must have acted on the admission of Karunawathie to her detriment. I

find evidence to the effect ~see for instance the partition plan marked as P12 where the

subject~matter was partitioned into two lots with the northern portion going to the 1st

Defendant and Nandawathie being allotted the southern part. How else could this have

occurred if Nandawathie was not a daughter? Is this not an affirmation of the

admission? Has she not acted to her detriment relying on the long held admission?

If one were to apply estoppel here, it would not be defence as it is the Plaintiff who

would be seeking to raise it by way of a rule of evidence, because it arises on evidence in

the case. Estoppel by representation would prevent the maker of a representation from

adducing evidence to contradict the state of affairs as previously represented and

adopted by the parties. Noteworthy is then the distinction between an admission and

estoppel by representation. An admission is not conclusive and it can be shown to be

false. If it remains uncontroverted, it is provable against the maker under Section 21 of

the Evidence Ordinance. This is the view I have taken of the admission. An admission

becomes conclusive when it is acted upon. When the representee acts on the admission

made by the representor, the admission would then become an estoppel.

Estoppel by representation or Estoppel in pais

But it is arguable that there could be an estoppel by representation on the facts that

emerged in the trial. This Court raised it in the course of argument but neither counsel

fully addressed Court on this matter and the written submission filed refers to it as a

12

defence. It may be or may not be so on the facts of each case. In this case it would be the

Plaintiff, if at all, to whom it is available and then it cannot amount to a defence.

Rather, it would be a rule of evidence as they say, since estoppel by representation or

estoppel in pais arises by evidence. Once the admission crystallizes into an estoppel by

representation, there is evidence that the party who raises estoppel has acted on the

representation to her detriment. Then the representor would be precluded from

adducing evidence to contradict the state of affairs as previously represented and

adopted by the parties~see Pickard v. Sears (1837) 6 Ad &. E1469 at 472; 112 ER 179 at

180~ 1 per Denman c.J; also see how this principle has been articulated in the celebrated

case on cheques Greenwood v. Martins Bank Ltd, (1932) AC 51 at 59 per Lord

Tomlin; Hopgood v. Brown (1955) 1 WLR 213 at 223; (1955) 1 All ER 550 at 559 per

Evershed MR; National Westminster Pic v. Somer International (UK) Ltd., (2002)

QB 1286 at 1302; (2001) EWCA Civ 970 at (36) per Potter LJ. Estoppel by

representation is concerned with maintaining a particular state of affairs according to

which the pre~existing rights and obligations between the parties will be determined.

As explained by Coke, "Estoppel is called as estoppel or conclusion, because a man's

owne act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth his mouth to allege or plead the truth" ~see

Coke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England or, A Commentary Upon Littleton, 18th

ed, corrected, 1823: reprinted by Law Book Exchange Ltd., New Jersey, 1999, vol 2, pp

352a~352b. See also Ben McFarlane, "The Limits to Estoppels" (2013) 7 Journal of

Equity 250 at 253~4; Ben McFarlane, "Understanding Equitable Estoppel: From

Metaphors to Better Laws" (2013) 66 CLP 267 at 272. Arguments were not addressed

to me on estoppel which is codified for us in Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance

though the Court raised it with counsel. Estoppel can arise by evidence and it can be

raised by a Plaintiff vis~a~vis the conduct of the Defendant. The Court raised it because

the parties informally partitioned the land by P12 after they had executed the mortgage

bond PH. To that extent there was a reliance placed by Nandawathie on the admission

of Karunawathie.

13

As I said previously this case can be disposed of on the relevant evidence that has been

led in the trial without reference to estoppel by representation and it is on the

unimpeached admission and opinion evidence by conduct that I proceed to determine

the issue in the case.

If what Karunawathie (the 1st Defendant) represented in the deed is false now and she

takes up a diametrically diverse position that Nandawathie is not an offshoot of

Horathala, she has then intentionally misled Nandawathie into agreeing to guarantee a

loan. The mortgage bond was a security for the loan given to them and if she was the

sole intestate heir of Horathala, why did not she execute the mortgage bond herself?

What is the import of stating in the mortgage bond that both of them (Nandawathie

and Karunawathie) are entitled to the property by paternal inheritance?

It is preposterous to allow the 1st Defendant to renege on her earlier assertion in the

mortgage bond. Other than a mere ipse dixit in the witness box that N andawathie was

not Horathala's daughter, there is no cogent evidence that inspires confidence in the

evidence of Karunawathie.

As I said, I need not go so far as estoppel to determine the status of Nandawathie. I

would rely on other items of evidence falling within Section 50 of the Evidence

Ordinance and provisions relating to admissions to conclude that Nandawathie was a

daughter of Horathala.

I find that no rebutting evidence has been led to contradict the mortgage bond or the

assertion in the deed. In the circumstances I take the view that the relevant evidence

pertaining to the paternity of Horathala over Nandawathie has not been rebutted nor

has it been whittled down. Thus I conclude that the Plaintiff has proved her case on a

balance of probabilities that Nandawathie-her predecessor in title was a daughter of

Horathala. But the learned Additional District Judge of Kandy has not considered the

import of some of the aforesaid relevant evidence and dismissed the plaint of the

Plaintiff who instituted this action to partition the subject-matter which she had

alleged belonged to her and Karunawathie.

14

I proceed to set aside the judgment of the l~arned Additional District Judge dated

04.04.1997 and allow the appeal of the Plaintiff~Appellant. Since I hold that

Nandawathie is a daughter of Horathala and the Plaintiff and the tt Defendant co~own

the property, I direct the learned District Judge of Kandy to conduct a trial to ascertain

their shares in the corpus and proceed to partition the property now that I have

determined that both are children of Horathala. The partition action can proceed on

the same pleadings that stand on the record with due changes necessary to bring in the

new parties if there has been any change in status.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
