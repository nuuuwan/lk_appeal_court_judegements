This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the Civil Appeal High

Court of Ratnapura dated 28.10.2009.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) was issued a permit in terms of section 19(2) of the Land

Development Ordinance (Ordinance) for state land 1 Acre in extent. However, the said land was

not surveyed and handed over to the Appellant although his grandfather and predecessors

possessed the said land from 1930. The Appellant requested that the land forming the subject

matter of the permit issued to him be surveyed and demarcated. However, according to the

Appellant steps were then taken to demarcate part of the said land to be given to the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents-Respondents (2 nd and 3rd Respondents) resulting in the land forming the subject matter of

the permit issued to him decreasing to about ~ an Acre.

In the circumstances, the Appellant filed the above styled action in the Provincial High Court of

the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura and sought the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision G'o.5 of the pt Respondent-Respondent (pt

Respondent) to grant a portion of land to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents without first giving

clear title to the land of an extent of 1 Acre possessed by the Appellant by virtue of permit

G'o.l numbered 51/625;

(b) A writ of mandamus compelling the pt Respondent to clear the land of 1 Acre already

given to the Appellant by virtue of permit G'o.l numbered 51/625.

Page 2 of 6

The position of the 1st Respondent-Respondent (pt Respondent) is that initially it was the mother

of the Appellant who was in unauthorized possession of the said state land and that once her

children, the Appellant and his brother Asela Sugath Senaratne the 2nd Respondent-Respondent

(2nd Respondent), became majors both of them were allowed to enter the land kachcheri.

Afterwards, the Appellant was issued the permit <3'0.1 while the brother was not given a permit

as he was a public officer.

According to the pt Respondent later the Appellant lost part of the said state land due to his

failure to develop it. At a survey conducted on 31.05.1992 it was found that both the Appellant

and his brother Asela Sugath Senaratne were in occupation of the said state land. Later the

Provincial Land Commissioner by letter dated 21.08.2007 (5.3) informed the pt Respondent to

take steps to issue a permit to the Appellant and a long-term lease of agricultural land to the 2nd

Respondent based on their present possession of the said state land. This decision of the

Provincial Land Commissioner was informed to the Appellant by the pt Respondent by letter

dated 15.10.2007 (5.4).

The learned High Court Judge after due inquiry dismissed the application of the Appellant and

hence this appeal.

Writ 0/ Certiorari

The learned High Court Judge held that <3'0.5 does not contain any decision but is only a letter

sent by the 1st Respondent to the Appellant's lawyer in response to a letter. It does refer to the

decision of the Provincial Land Commissioner by letter dated 21.08.2007 (5.3) which according

to the Appellant is only an advisory letter. I am unable to accept this proposition. <3'0.5 is not a

decision but only a letter sent to the Appellant's lawyer informing of the decision of the Provincial

Land Commissioner. It is trite law that a writ of certiorari will only issue to quash a decision where

the decision maker has determined questions affecting the rights of subjects. [De Mel v. De Silva

(51 N.L.R. lOS), Dias v. Abeywardena (68 N.L.R. 409), Fernando v. Jayaratne (78 N.L.R. 123), G.PA.

Silva and others v. Sadique and others (1978-79) 1 Sri.L.R. 166, Dayaratne v. Senaratne, Minister

of Lands and others (2006) 1 Sri.L.R. 7]. <3'0. 5 is not such a decision and as such the learned High

Court Judge was correct in concluding that it cannot be quashed by a writ of certiorari.

Page 3 of 6

The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of certiorari is that the

person or authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed should be made

a respondent to the application and the failure to do so is fatal and provides in itself a ground for

the dismissal of the application in limine [Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr.

Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero and four others (2011) 2 SrLL.R. 258]. The learned High Court

Judge correctly held that the Provincial Land Commissioner was a necessary party as he was the

person who had taken the decision to divide the land between the Appellant and the 2nd

Respondent and the application must be dismissed as necessary parties were not before court.

Writ 0/ Mandamus

The learned High Court Judge held that the pt Respondent does not owe a public duty imposed

by law towards the Appellant to give him an undisturbed possession of a clearly demarcated one-

acre land in terms of the permit 60.1. I will now examine the validity of this statement of law.

Section 19(3) of the Ordinance read with Transfer of Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act No. 58

of 1992 states that the Divisional Secretary shall cause the land alienated on a permit to be

surveyed by the Surveyor General, and the extent and description (by reference to metes and

bounds) of the land so surveyed shall be inserted in such permit. While this clearly imposes a

statutory duty on the pt Respondent to set out the extent and description (by reference to metes

and bounds) of the land surveyed in the permit, it is not clear whether that duty extends to give

a permit holder undisturbed possession of a clearly demarcated area falling within the permit

issued in terms of section 19(2) of the Ordinance when the permit is issued to the permit holder.

The preamble of a Statute may legitimately be consulted when interpreting any section of the

Act whose meaning is not clear [Pasangna v. The Registrar General and another (67 N.L.R. 33)].

The preamble to the Ordinance states that it is to provide for the systematic development and

alienation of state land. There certainly cannot be a systematic development of state land where

permits are issued to permit holders without giving them undisturbed possession of a clearly

demarcated area falling within the permit. In fact, there have been many disputes raised before

courts due to such actions on the part of public officials. Therefore, I disagree with the learned

High Court Judge and hold that that the Divisional Secretary is under a statutory duty in terms of

Page 4 of 6

section 19(3) of the Ordinance read with the preamble to give a permit holder undisturbed

possession of a clearly demarcated area falling within the permit issued in terms of section 19(2)

of the Ordinance when the permit is issued to the permit holder.

Although the position of the pt Respondent is that the Appellant lost part of the state land

described in the permit @0.1 due to his failure to develop it, no documentation has been

produced to support this assertion. However, a writ of mandamus cannot be issued in this instant

as Appellant has failed to seek a quashing of the decision taken by the Provincial Land

Commissioner by letter dated 21.08.2007 (eJ.3). In the circumstances, there is no question of

issuing a writ of mandamus compelling the pt Respondent to clear the land of 1 Acre already

given to the Appellant by virtue of permit @0.1 numbered 51/625.

There is also a further matter which stands in the way of any relief been granted to the Appellant.

The reliefs claimed by the Appellant are for a writ of certiorari quashing the decision @o.s of the

pt Respondent-Respondent (1st Respondent) to grant a portion of land to the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents without first giving clear title to the land of an extent of 1 Acre possessed by the

Appellant by virtue of permit @0.1 numbered 51/625 and a writ of mandamus compelling the pt

Respondent to clear the land of 1 Acre already given to the Appellant by virtue of permit @0.1

numbered 51/625.

In The Superintendent, Stafford Estate and two others v. Solaimuthu Rasu [(2013) 1 SrLL.R. 25]

the Supreme Court held that the Provincial High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear cases

where dispossession or encroachment or alienation of State Lands is/are in issue. That being the

situation in the instant case, the High Court in any event did not have jurisdiction to entertain the

application of the Appellant in any case. This is a patent lack of jurisdiction and the fact that it

was not raised in the High Court does not vest it with jurisdiction. Court directed the parties to

address this issue in the written submissions which has been done. I have considered the

submissions made by the learned counsel for the Appellant on this issue. Nothing therein moves

me to change my views expressed above.

For the forgoing reasons and subject to the statutory duty I have adverted to above, I see no

reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the Civil Appeal High

Court of Ratnapura dated 28.10.2009.

Before concluding, I am compelled to observe that there have been many instances where

disputes pertaining to state land have occurred due to the failure on the part of the Divisional

Secretary to give a permit holder undisturbed possession of a clearly demarcated area falling

within the permit issued in terms of section 19(2) of the Ordinance when the permit is issued to

the permit holder. Therefore, Court requests the Hon. Attorney General to inform the relevant

authorities that the Divisional Secretary is under a statutory duty in terms of section 19(3) of the

Ordinance read with the preamble to give a permit holder undisturbed possession of a clearly

demarcated area falling within the permit issued in terms of section 19(2) of the Ordinance when

the permit is issued to the permit holder. The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of the

judgment to the Hon. Attorney General.

Subject to above, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
