ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General

for illegal possession of an automatic firearm, an offence punishable under

Sections 22(1) and (3) of the Firearms Ordinance No. 33 of 1916 as

amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996.

After trial, he was convicted by the High Court of Nuwara Eliya and

was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Accused-

Appellant seeks to challenge its validity on the basis that he was deprived

of a fair trial. In further expanding this ground of appeal, the Accused-

Appellant contended that;

i. the findings of the trial Court were not supported by

the evidence,

11. the trial Court had failed to properly evaluate the

prosecution evidence, particularly on the consideration

of improbability,

111. the trial Court had failed to note that the Accused-

Appellant was denied of the procedural protection he is

entitled to during investigations,

IV. the trial Court had failed to properly evaluate the dock

statement.

In support of his 1st ground of appeal, the Accused-Appellant

submits that the trial Court had arrived at a finding that the firearm he is

alleged to have possessed is an automatic firearm when in fact the

Government Analyst Report (tendered to Court marked as P3) merely

described it as a "firearm" as per the definition of Section 2 of the Firearms

Ordinance. Therefore, the Accused- Appellant claims that the conclusion

reached by the trial Court on this fundamental element of the charge

against him is without any supporting evidence.

The 2nd ground of appeal is in relation to evaluation of the

prosecution evidence in its entirety.

The complaint of the Accused-Appellant is that the evidence of the

witnesses for the prosecution are contradictory inter se and per se and, in

addition, their version of events is not a probable one.

It was submitted that witness Dayaratne's evidence given before the

High Court of Kandy is contradictory to his evidence at the High Court of

Nuwara Eliya. In addition, it contradicted with the evidence of other

witnesses for the prosecution. The Accused-Appellant, in his oral and

written submissions highlighted those inconsistencies in relation to the

detection, delivery of the weapon, the way the magazines were attached to

it, arrest of the Accused -Appellant and his questioning.

The 3rd ground of appeal was based on the evidence that the

production item was not labelled when it was handed over to Maskeliya 3

Police, and it was done in the absence of the Accused-Appellant, contrary

to the procedure established by law. He also relied on the fact that there

was no marking made on the item of production by the Police before it

was sealed in a parcel.

In relation to the 4th ground of appeal, the Accused-Appellant

submitted that his evidence that the weapon belonged to one W.G.

Ranasinghe, who travelled in another vehicle and was a candidate of that

election, has not properly been considered by the trial Court as only a

passing reference has been made to it in its judgment.

Consideration of these grounds of appeal requires a brief description

of the case presented by the prosecution.

On 10th October 2000, an election was held to elect people's

representatives for the Provincial Councils. In order to assist the Police to

keep peace, Sri Lanka Army has assigned some officers and soldiers to

conduct mobile patrols in the designated areas and also to man road

blocks.

Second Lieutenant Hangilipola (PW 4) was in charge of a platoon of

28 soldiers and they have reported to Senior Superintendent of Police

Meegoda on the 9th October 2000 and was assigned to Maskeliya Police area

on the election day. He had reported to the Officer-in-Charge of Maskeliya

Police, Heenketiya at about 2.45 or 3.00 p.m. with some soldiers and had

immediately taken steps to set up a road block in close vicinity to the

Police Station, upon instructions of the SSP who conveyed the message

that there was an incident of shooting near Princess Junction of Hatton

town, to a Police mobile unit. PW4 instructed his men to stop all the

vehicles and check them.

PC 25766 Dayaratne (PW 2) was also assigned to the contingent led

by PW4 along with Lance Corporal Lalinda (PW 5) and eight others.

Soon after they set up the road block, a convoy of vehicles arrived,

and they were travelling towards Hatton. The vehicles were stopped at the

check point and PW 5 conducted a search on a white coloured van. On the

opposite side of its driver, PW5 saw, the Accused-Appellant was keeping a

weapon between his knees with one magazine fitted to it whilst being

seated. Then he alerted PW 4, that a weapon was found in the possession of

the Accused-Appellant. As PW4 walked up to the van, PW5 handed him

over a T 56 weapon taken from the Accused-Appellant. There were other

passengers in the back of the van.

Upon examination of the firearm, it was noted by the witnesses that

the serial number of the T56 weapon had been filed off, but upon

dismantling its number was seen by the witness carved on the spring in

the firing mechanism. When questioned about the authority to possess the

firearm, the Accused-Appellant could produce none. Altogether there

were 48 ammunitions in the two magazines that were taken charge by the

officers from the possession of the Accused- Appellant.

Then the officers have taken the Accused-Appellant into the Police

station where he was later arrested and detained at. The candidate who

travelled in the vehicle that came first in the convoy also came into the

Police. No other person was arrested since the weapon was found in the

possession of the Accused-Appellant.

Thereafter, he was produced before the Magistrate's Court. The T 56

weapon was sent for analysis and the Government Analyst Report

(marked as P3) confirmed that it is an automatic firearm.

In the light of evidence reproduced above, it is appropriate at this

stage to consider the reasoning of the trial Court vis-a-vis the several

grounds of appeal raised by the Accused-Appellant.

As already noted the first ground of appeal is about the absence of

any evidence that the firearm possessed by the Accused-Appellant is an

automatic firearm. When the evidence presented by the prosecution

through PWl and his report marked as P3 are examined there were clear

oral and documentary evidence before the trial Court to decide that the

firearm possessed by the Accused-Appellant is in fact an automatic

firearm. The evidence concerning this element of the offence has been

clearly referred to by the trial Court in its judgment. In the circumstances,

it appears that this particular ground of appeal is founded on a totally

misconceived notion of evidence.

The 2nd ground of appeal concerns two aspects of the evidence of the

prosecution. Firstly, the Accused-Appellant contended that the evaluation

of the credibility of the version of events as claimed by the prosecution

witnesses on the basis of probability is erroneous. Secondly, he contended

that due to the inconsistencies that exist in the prosecution evidence inter se

and per se, the trial Court fallen into error in accepting them as credible and

reliable evidence.

In support of the first segment of the 2nd ground of appeal, the

Accused-Appellant heavily relied upon the probability of the conduct

6

.~ i

J I ! j ! : 1 I

~

attributed to him by the prosecution witnesses by posing the question that

when the army soldiers stopped the vehicle he was travelling in, would he

hold an automatic weapon in between his knees as they claimed ?

Since the complaint of the Accused-Appellant is based on an

erroneous finding on a question of fact by misapplying the test of

probability should be considered at this juncture.

In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 95,

Jayasuriya J. observed that;

1/ A Judge, in applying the test of Probability and Improbability,

relies heavily on his knowledge of men and matters and the

patterns of conduct observed by human beings both ingenious as

well as those who are less talented and fortunate."

The trial Court, in accepting the prosecution version as credible and

probable, had the support of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses to

conclude that it is a probable version of events. There is clear evidence that

the decision to set up a road block was an instantaneous act upon hearing

the news of a shooting incident. It is therefore essentially a surprise move

by PW4 and when the convoy of vehicles arrived there with their

headlights on, its passengers had no prior notice of setting up of a the

road block. The Accused- Appellant was seated in the left front seat and

his movements could clearly be observed by the army officers who

manned the road block. When a person carries an unlicensed firearm, and

is about to be detected there is no other way for him to hide the weapon,

except to have it between his knees, hoping the examiner would not notice

7

it. In fact, PW5 had seen it only when he ventured to examine the

Accused-Appellant through the side window. Upto that point, the

Accused-Appellant was successful in concealing it from the notice of the

army officers.

The prosecution evidence in relation to the manner in which the

firearm was held by the Accused-Appellant, when viewed in this angle,

seemed a probable version and therefore we are not inclined to accept the

submission that the conduct attributed to him by the prosecution

witnesses, particularly by PW5, should be disbelieved only on the basis of

improbability.

The second segment deals with the acceptance of the prosecution

evidence, in spite of the inconsistencies that exist in it inter se and per se.

The trial Court had focused its attention to the inconsistencies highlighted

by the Accused-Appellant in his long closing address. It had the extra

benefit of considering the prosecution evidence when the Accused-

Appellant made an application under Section 200(1) of the Criminal

Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979. Having examined the evidence led by

the prosecution, in the light of the submissions of the Accused-Appellant,

particularly in relation to inconsistencies, the trial Court concludes that the

prosecution version is consistent and was corroborated and therefore is

credible. Having carefully considered the inconsistencies referred to by the

Accused-Appellant was concur with the conclusion reached by the trial

Court.

The judgment of Samaraweera v The Attorney General (1990) 1 Sri

L.R. 256, in relation to the evaluation of evidence, observed that;

" Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of skill in

observation upon any point or points, exaggeration or mere

embroidery or embellishment must be distinguished from

deliberate falsehood."

In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others (supra) it was observed that;

"After a considerable lapse of time, as has resulted in this

application, it is customary to come across contradictions in the

testimony of witnesses. This is a true characteristic feature of

human testimony which is full of infirmities and weaknesses

especially when proceedings are held long after the events spoken

to by the witnesses. A judge must expect such contradictions to

exist in the testimony."

When such discrepancies do exist in the evidence, a trial Court could

utilise the test adopted in Jagathsena v Bandaranaike (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397

that;

"Whether the discrepancy due to dishonesty or to defective

memory or whether the witnesses power of observations were

limited? "

9

1 1 j ! I f i 1 1

~

In the light of the collective reasoning of these judgments, that the

inconsistencies that were highlighted by the Accused-Appellant are on

insignificant points and could easily be attributable to human error in the

observation and in limitations of expression of what was observed.

It is noted that the learned High Court Judge who convicted the

Accused-Appellant has had the benefit of observing the demeanour and

deportment of all the witnesses for the prosecution when they gave

evidence before him. The Police witness had no notes to refresh his

memory as the relevant information books were destroyed in 2007. The

army officers, had only their memory to rely upon to give evidence. They

all gave evidence after 13 years since the detection.

In spite of all these negative factors, they have made a consistent,

probable and therefore a truthful and reliable version of events before the

trial Court for it to act upon. The credibility of a witness is clearly a

question of fact and when that question of fact is based on the demeanour

of the witnesses, as in this particular instance, this Court would be

reluctant to interfere with such finding of facts, unless II such evidence

could be shown to be totally inconsistent or perverse and lacking

credibility" (as per Kumar de Silva & two Others v Attorney General

(2010) 2 Sri L.R. 169).

10

The trial Court had devoted significant space in its judgment to

consider the challenge mounted by the Accused-Appellant on the

prosecution evidence on the footing that it had failed to prove the "chain

of production". Soon after the firearm was detected it was dismantled in

the presence of the Accused-Appellant and its serial number was recorded.

This number did match with the weapon examined by the Government

Analyst. The trial Court considered the oral and documentary evidence

presented before it in the light of the submissions of the Accused-

Appellant and correctly concluded that the prosecution has established the

inward chain of productions beyond reasonable doubt.

The 4th ground of appeal is also presented on a misconceived basis

that the trial Court had made only a passing reference to his dock

statement and failed to consider it in the light of applicable legal

principles.

At the commencement of the judgment itself, the trial Court had

clearly and accurately laid down the legal principles that are applicable to

a case presented by an accused and has referred to the "intermediate

position" as well. Then it summarises the version of the Accused-

Appellant as stated in his dock statement. The trial Court then holds that

his claim of pinning the culpability on him for illegal possession of a

firearm when in fact it was in the possession of his political leader, W.G.

Ranasinghe, is taken up for the first time in the dock statement as an

afterthought and proceeded to reject it on that basis. We are in agreement

with the view held by the trial Court in relation to the dock statement of

the Accused- Appellant.

11

In these circumstances, we are of the firm view that the appeal of the

Accused-Appellant is devoid of merit. Accordingly, his conviction and

sentence is affirmed and this Court makes further order to dismiss his

appeal.
