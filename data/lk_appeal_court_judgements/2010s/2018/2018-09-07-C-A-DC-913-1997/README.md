M.M.A GAFOOR, J.

The original Plaintiff-Respondent in this case who described herself as the

Administratrix of the deceased Semion Meeriyagalla (hereinafter referred to as the

'Respondent') instituted this action against the Defendants-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as 'Appellants') seeking inter alia, for a declaration that the original

Respondent (deceased) is the legal owner of the property described in the Second

schedule to the Plaint; to eject the Appellants and all those persons holding under the

Appellants from the said property; and also to recover the damages as prayed for in

the plaint.

The Respondent in her Plaint alleged that the deceased Semion Meeriyagalla was the

owner of the property in suit; he acquired it in 1982 (by deed No. 190 dated

16.06.1982 attested by Sujatha Liyanage, Notary Public - marked as P2); and the

Respondent is the duly appointed Administratrix of the estate of the said Semion

Meeriyagalla and further alleged that the Appellants have entered in to the said

premises unlawfully on or about 16.11.1991 and were occupation thereof causing

damages to the said property.

The Appellants whilst denying the Respondent's averments contained in the Plaint,

and pleaded that they in consequence to an advertisement appeared in 'Silumina'

newspaper met the H. Chandrasiri referred to in the Plaint and his wife G.M.

N andawathei, the owner of the property concerned and purchased the said property

after settling the State Mortgage Bank loan amounting to Rs. 60,2001-, and got the

said mortgage released and paid Nadawathie a sum ofRs. 150,0001- for the transfer

of the property. The Appellants further stated that they after purchasing the said

property and after having obtained the necessary approval from the local authority,

constructed a house spending over Rs. 500,0001- thereby they moved for the

dismissal of the Respondent's action with cost. Therefore the Appellants further

stated that by the above purchasing they have obtained title to the said property by

Page 4 of14

deed No. 157 dated 01.02.1990 attested by M.C.L. Mendis, Notary Public - marked

as V2.

Further, the Respondent stated that she became aware that the Appellants have

entered the property unlawfully and was building a house upon that she complained

to the Police. It was also her evidence that the Police in consequence of her

complaint investigated the matter and had filed a case against the aforesaid H.

Chandrasiri for forging a deed, in the Magistrate's Court of Nugegoda.

This case was taken up on 13.05.1996 before the District Judge of Mount Lavinia

and proceeded for trial and 2 admissions were recorded, i.e. the corpus and that one

H. Chandrasiri was the owner of this property at one time. 8 issues raised on behalf

of the Respondent and 6 issues raised on behalf of the Appellants. However, upon

objection by the Respondent, 2 issues (issues relating to Prescription) of the

Appellants were not allowed. Appellants raised an issue in relation to prayer (a) of

the Plaint but the learned trial judge rejected the said proposed legal issue.

The documents PI to P7 were marked on behalf of the Respondent and on behalf of

the Appellants the documents VI to V5 were marked and produced.

On 07.11.1997, after conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge delivered his

judgment holding in favour of the Respondent as prayed for in the plaint. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellants preferred this appeal.

The Appellants appealed on the following grounds:

a) The said judgment is contrary to law and against the evidence adduced at the trial.

b) The learned trial judge has erred in Law by rejecting the legal issue raised by the Appellants in relation to the relief prayed for in prayer (a) of the plaint without allowing the parties to make their submission in relation to the said important legal objection.

Page 5 of!4

c) The trial judge has completely misdirected himself in rejecting the documentary official evidence relating to the registration of deed No. 5706 in the absence of any cogent and properly proved evidence to the effect that in fact the deed No. 5706 is a forgery.

d) The trial judge in any event erred in Law by not considering the fact that the Appellants have effected extensive bona fide improvements to the property concerned in arriving at his said judgment.

With reference to the ground (b) of the Appellants, they further submitted that the

original Plaintiff-Respondent was acting in representative capacity as the

administratix of the intestate estate of deceased Semion Meeriyagalla and therefore

she cannot claim the property in question personally for herself and whatever the

relief she should ask on behalf of the deceased Semion Meeriyagalla's estate as she

was acting on temporary capacity as the adminstratrix of the estate of the said

deceased until the conclusion of the testamentary proceedings. In addition to that,

the Appellants further stated that the Respondent did not submit the administrtrix

certificate along with the Plaint to establish her capacity as a lawful representative

person to the deceased. However that certificate had been submitted on a trial date

(15.07.1996) and marked as P5.

Before dealing with crux of this appeal, it is necessary to dispose of a belatedness

question by the Appellants that focus on the representative capacity of the

Respondent on behalf of the deceased as mentioned above.

I am unable to agree with the above contention because there is no authority to

challenge the rights of an administrator who acting in representative capacity.

In Chelliah vs. M. Wijenathan (1951), 54 N.L.R. 337 Gratian J held that when a person

dies intestate, the title to his immovable property is transmitted automatically to his

heirs; an administrator is deem to represent the heirs of the intestate and date of

Page 6of14

appointment of the administrator is immaterial; the action may also bring for the

recovery of an immovable property from a trespasser too.

In a very large majority of actions in our courts for declaration of title to immovable

property, the claimant is required to sue in his own name in order to establish his

rights. But there are some forms of actions where the assertion of a claimant's rights

must be made on his behalf by some other person suing in a representative capacity.

In the present case, the administrator is the wife of the deceased; she has obtained the

letter of administration of Case No. 29617 IT in the District Court of Colombo duly

produced and marked as P5 in the trial without any objections of the Appellants,

thereby her position cannot be questioned.

Appellants argument on the above point is remind me the decision of Silva vs Silva

(1907) 10 N.L.R. 234. In this case a full bench judges from Supreme Court held that

the Civil Procedure Code did not entitle an administrator to bring an action for

declaration of title to immovable property. However, it is now settled law that the

executor or administrator has the same powers as regards immovable properties. In

Thornton vs. Velaithan Chetty, (1938) 40 N.L.R. 157. Justice Maartensz and Justice

Moseley held that under section 404 of the Civil Procedure Court, Plaintiff's right to

bring an action, as administrator for declaration of title to land belonging to the

estate cannot be questioned. The same affirmations already held in Moysa Fernando

vs. Alice Fernando (1900) 4 N.L.R. 201 and Fernando vs. Unnanse (1918) 20 N. L. R. 378.

Considering the above, I am of the view that the said Administratix does have

capacity to prosecute and maintain this action and appeal.

In the District Court the Respondent claimed a declaration of title to the land in

question. There is abundant authority that when a party claiming a declaration of

title must have title himself. In this case the Respondent institute her action for

declaration of title for the land (res) question with the Deed of Transfer No. 190

dated 16.06.1982 attested by Sujatha Liyanage, Notary Public. Whilst the Appellants

Page 7of14

also claim the ownership for the same land with Deed No. 157 dated 01.02.1990

attested by M.C.L Mendis, Notary Public. Further, the Appellants were not

challenging the fact that Respondent's husband Semion Meeriyagalla purchasing the

said property from H.Chandrasiri by deed No. 190 dated 15.06.1982, but they have

raised two different issues on the deed. (P2)

Firstly, the authenticity of Deed of Transfer No. 190 dated 16.06.1982 attested by

Sujatha Liyanage, Notary Public was questioned. The Appellants had questioned the

authenticity of the said deed as per the testimony alleged to have been given by the

said Notary Public (in page 61 of the brief), to the effect that the vendor was

unknown to the Notary and that she knew only one of the witnesses who signed the

deed.

Therefore, the Appellants take a position that the said deed cannot be considered an

authenticate evidence in this case because according to section 31 (9) of the Notaries

Ordinance, a notary only can attest a deed if he know both witnesses in the case if

the vendor or the maker of the document is unknown to him. But in this case said

notary testified that he knew only one witness. Thereby the Appellants argue that the

evidence of the Notary cannot be considered to prove deed No. 190 in terms of the

provisions contained in Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.

I do not think that the above argument raised by the Appellants is strong. In the case

of Wijeyaratne and Another vs. Somawathie (2002) 1 S.L.R 93, held that non-

compliance with the provision of the Notaries Ordinance will not invalidate a deed

as long as the provisions of section 33 of the Ordinance and section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. According to this scenario, the said deed cannot

invalidate. By this way, if the deed is valid, it could be used as evidence under

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. For this purpose, the said Notary may

consider as lawful witness; and trial judge may record his evidence. Not surprisingly

these all have been done by the Respondent.

Page 8 ofl4

In the case of Wilisindahamy vs. Karunawathi and Others (J 980) 2 S.L.R 136 this court

has taken a view that Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance was concerned there was

proof of execution if the evidence of this witness was believed, which permitted the

deed to be used as evidence. The two witnesses have signed a declaration that they

were well acquainted with the executant and that they knew his proper name,

occupation and residence. What the Notaries Ordinance Section 31 (9) states is that a

Notary had to satisfy himself that the witnesses were persons of good repute and that they

knew the executant's proper name, occupation and residence. Therefore, the claim made

by the Appellants questioning the validity of the deed No. 190 cannot be sustained

since the Notary had made and had attested the said Deed fulfilling the lawful

requirements stipulated in the Notaries Ordinance and Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance, therefore the Respondent would still has a valid deed which can be used

as a title.

Secondly, it was the position of the Appellants that thereafter the said Meeriyagalla

transferred back the said land in question to H. Chandrasiri in August 1982 (merely

after the earlier transaction) allegedly by deed No. 5706 attested by M.D.C.

Senaratne, Notary Public. Answering this fact, the Respondent stressed that this was

(deed No. 5706) a fraudulent deed. The said M.D.C. Senaratne, Notary Public who

attested the deed No. 5706, died before the commencement of the trial. Even though

when M.A. SUjatha Wijeyelakshmi Liyanage, Notary Public who was attested the

deed No. 190 called for the Respondent's witness, she has admitted that the said

M.D.C Senaratne was her father and she has handed over her father's deed protocols

to the Land Registry. Further she said that the Land Registry acknowledged that

protocols of deeds No. 01 to 5171 was received (marked as P7). Therefore it was the

position of Sujatha Liyanage, Notary Public, that her father attested deeds only up to

No. 5171, and he never had attested a deed numbering 5706.

Page 9 of14

Furthermore, the Appellants to build their averments regarding deed No. 5706, they

were marked and submitted a document (VI) which was an extract; the only

document shows of the existence of such a deed were being registered. But the said

witness (Sujatha Liyanage N.P) affirmed that the said deed could not be found even

in the land registry duplicates.

Counsel for the Respondent has submitted that the said H. Chandrasiri (Appellants'

witness), has admitted a fact that the Police has filed criminal charges against him in

the Magistrate's Court of Gangodawila, for preparing a forged deed - No. 5706

(Vide: proceedings at pages 224 and 225 of the Appeal Brief) and the case was still

pending therein. (According to the written submission on behalf the Respondent, dated

04.12.2017)

As I mentioned earlier, the Appellants further averred that H. Chandrasiri has

thereafter transferred the said property to his wife N andawathei, who in turn has

mortgaged it to the State Mortgage Bank. Appellants thereafter paid a sum of Rs. 60,

2001 - to that Bank and got the mortgage released and for a further sum of Rs.

150,0001- got it transferred in their names from Nandawathei. Likewise witness

Chandrasiri admit the above and he further said that earlier deed was at the

Mortgage Bank and once the mortgage was released by the Appellants, the deed

would have been given to the Appellants. But in contrast, the Appellants were taken

a position that no prior deeds were given to them either by the bank or by

Chandrasiri or N andawathei.

Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Appellants who have not acted with

prudence at the time of buying the property in question from N andawathie who did

not have any paper title to the questioned property could not be given proper title

merely because of claiming title under an instrument which is not even produced

before this Court. I am agreeing with these submissions. Also I observe that no

documentary evidence whatsoever was produced at the trial to prove that there in

Page 10 ofl4

fact was a Mortgage Bond to the said Bank and the Appellants have got it released by

paying Rs. 60,2001- to the Bank. He further submitted that if the Appellants' position

is true, no mortgage bond, Cancellation of bond, Land Registry extract where the

mortgage was registered or even payment receipts relating to the release of mortgage

was produced in this case. Thus the Respondent argues that the Appellants' position

could be dismissed.

I am in an accustomed legal view that in civil actions its paramount important that,

parties need to submit their relevant document which relates to important matters for

the court of law to keep in mind so long as a trial is in progress and they can

maintain the sustainability of their oral testimonies with those documentary

evidence. The learned District Judge was mindful on these accustomed procedures,

thereby he has rejected the Appellants' claims.

Similarly, I observe that N andawathie failed to testify before the district court when

her evidence was led before the court as to how he obtained title to the property

(from her husband H. Chandrasiri) in question through the alleged deed No. 157.

Admittedly, I see no reasons for accepting the Appellants' submissions regarding the

lawful title to land in question. The Appellants' position still remains skeptical and I

feel difficult to fathom the validity of the testimony and submissions.

I am mindful that, this present case instituted for praying a declaration of title for a

res (actio rei vindivatio) by the Respondent. An important feature of the actio rei

vindivatio is that it has to necessarily fail if the plaintiff cannot clearly establish his

title. These significances emphasized this Court and the Supreme Court in several

precedents before.

Page 11 of14

In De Silva vs. Goonatileke (1931) 32 N.L.R. 217 Macdonell, C.J. citing authorities

on Roman Dutch Law referred to principles applicable to rei vindicatio action in the

following manner:

UThere is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration of title must have title

himself. ..... The authorities unite in holding that the plaintiff must show title to the

corpus in dispute, and that, if he cannot, the action will not lie. "

As Ranasinghe, J., pointed out in Jinawathei vs. Emalin Perera (1986) 2 S.L.R. 121 at

page 142, a plaintiff to a rei vindication action "can and must succeed only on the

strength of his own title, and not upon the weakness of the defendant."

In Wanigaratne vs. Juwanis Appuhamy 65 N.L.R. 167 Herath, J. stated that

U the defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove anything, still less his own title.

The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength

that the defendant's title is poor or not established. The plaintiff must prove and

establish his title"

Accordingly, in this case obviously the Respondent has proved his own title with the

proper deed and other evidences. There is a accustomed procedure that once the title

is established by the plaintiff, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove that

he has a right to possession or occupation of the property (vide: Siyaneris vs. Udenis

((1951) 52 N.L.R. 289). But they were not done because their title skeptic and

dreadful.

For the aforesaid reasons, I am of the opinion that the Respondent had established

title to the subject matter of the action.

The Appellants in their submissions stated that they purchased the property as bona

fide purchasers and entered the property on the same capacity and thereafter

constructed a house within the said property without any obstruction.

Page 12 of14

Further they stated that the trial judge in any event erred in law by not considering

the fact that the Appellants have effected extensive bona fide improvements to the

property concerned in arriving at his said judgment.

However, the Respondent submitted that as per the maxim caveat emptor the

Appellants have not taken any precaution concerning the property in question prior

the sale; have failed to check the existence or non-existence of previous deeds by

which N andawathie alleged to have obtained title to the property in question.

Respondent stated further, the Appellants cannot claim remedies of a bona fide

purchaser since they have failed to exercise prudence and care in checking the

creditworthiness of the vendor and whether the vendor had title to the property in

question before purchasing.

After careful evaluation of all the documents marked by the Respondent, I observe

that P4 is a notice of quit which had been sent to the Appellants by the Respondent.

In the trial the Appellants admit that they received the notice; and no evidence from

them to show that they disputed the contents therein.

In the District Court, the Appellants in their answer had only sought the dismissal of

the plaint; they have not claimed a declaration that they are bona fide purchasers.

Further they were not raising any issues regarding the matter.

The Appellants for the first time in the appeal, state that they are bona fide purchasers.

This claim has to be decided by leading evidence and also after raising issues in that

aspect before the District Court, the said question is not a question of law. The

question under the reference is a question of fact.

Therefore, I am in a view that the Appellants cannot be permitted to raise a question

with regard to the question of fact for the first time in the appeal.

Page 13 of14

It is clear law as held in Jayawickrema vs. David Silva (1973) 76 NLR 427:

II A party cannot be permitted to present in appeal a case different from that presented in

the trial Court where matters of fact are involved which were not in issue at the trial,

such case not being one which raises a question of law. "

In Rev. Pallegama Gnanaratna vs. Rev. Galkiriyagama Soratha (1988) I SLR 99, a

Five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court held that a question which is not a pure

question of law, but a mixed question of fact and law, cannot be taken up for the

first time on appeal. See, Setha vs. Weerakoon 49 NLR 225, Violet Perera vs. Rupa

Hewawasam (1985) I SLR 229 and Candappa vs. Ponnamlampillai (1993) I SLR 184.

In all the circumstances of this case, in my opinion the learned District Judge has

entered judgment in favour of the Respondent based on admissions, issues,

documentary evidences and testimonies recorded at the trial. I have considered the

entire judgment, and see no basis to interfere and the trial judge has given enough

reasons inter alia on the validity of deed No. 190 which has been marked (P2) by the

Respondent in the District Court. All necessary primary facts have been considered.

And as held in Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) (1) SLR 119, generally this court

would not interfere with primary facts unless such findings are highly unacceptable.

Trial Judge has correctly held that Respondent's documents PI - P7 were used in

evidence without any enigmas.

In all the above circumstances, I affirm the judgment of the District Court dated

07.11.1997, and dismiss this appeal without costs.
