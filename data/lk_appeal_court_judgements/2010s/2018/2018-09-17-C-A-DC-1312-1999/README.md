A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

hiS case turns on the question of whether there was between the parties in the

case a contract of sale for 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium or the contract was

for 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The learned Additional District Judge of Galle by

his judgment dated 07.04.l999 held that the contract between the Plaintiff and the

Defendant in the case was for a sale of 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium and allowed

the claim of the Plaintiff on the premise that there had been a breach of contract on the

part of the Defendant Transport Board. The story goes as follows:

The Defendant~ Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") ~

Southern Region Transport Board advertised in newspapers for tenders to buy, among

other things, around 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The paper advertisement (PI)

was published on 15.01.l988. 13 days later, the Plaintiff~Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") submitted his bid (VI). The Plaintiff submitted

a bid (VI) after having filled in a standard form that had been issued by the Southern

Region Transport Board~the Defendant~Appellant. Along with an unfilled standard

form to submit the bid, another document (V2) containing conditions had already been

given to the Plaintiff. Any prospective buyer (bidder) of scrap Aluminium would have

to obtain a standard bid form and V2 (the list of conditions), before he could make his

bid to buy the scrap Aluminium. The prospective bidder (buyer) would have to deposit

a sum of Rs. 100/~ as non~refundable and another sum of Rs.5,OOO/~ as refundable

deposits and it was thereafter that the tender documents~the standard form to be filled

in and V2~the documents containing the conditions would be issued to the prospective

bidder.

In other words the standard bid form which had to be filled in by the prospective

buyerlbidder and V2 (the document imposing a list of conditions) were given together

to the prospective buyers (bidders) before they could perfect the standard form and

submit a properly perfected bid to the Defendant Southern Region Transport Board~see

page 75 of the appeal brief.

2

The list of conditions (V2) that had been given to the prospective bidder quite

interestingly contained a clause~i.e., clause 6 to be exact, which stipulated that the

prospective buyer would have to purchase more or less the stipulated quantity. In other

words, looking at the advertisement which called for tenders to buy 10 metric tons of

scrap Aluminium, one would gather from its import that the list of conditions imposed

a condition that the bidder would have to buy more or less than 10 metric tons of scrap

Aluminium, if the need arose.

One metric ton of scrap Aluminium attracted a price of Rs. 31,331/~. The bidder, if

successful, would pay a sum of Rs. 31,331/ ~ per metric ton. This would constitute the

factual template within which the resolution of the issues immanent in the case has to

be made. Nandasena Gamage~the Plaintiff~Respondent who was admittedly an

experienced businessman filled in the standard form given by the Defendant and

submitted his bid~VI on 28.01.1998. Between the paper advertisement (PI dated

15.01.1988) which called for bids and the bid from Nandasena (VI dated 28.01.1988),

Nandasena stated in his testimony that he visited a depot, albeit unspecified by name,

to inspect the stock of scrap Aluminium which the Defendant Transport Board was

intending to sell. Before he made the bid, he had visited a depot which housed a pile of

scrap Aluminium for sale.

It was after an inspection of the pile that he filled in the standard bid form and

submitted it to the Defendant Board. The bid dated 28.01.1988, just sets out that he

would be buying scrap Aluminium at a sum of Rs. 31,33l!~ per metric ton. No quantity

of scrap Aluminium was specifically mentioned in this bid. In other words when he

submitted the bid (VI), nowhere did he add a condition that he was offering to buy

only 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. But it has to be recalled that the list of

conditions that had been given to him (V2) imposed a condition that he might have to

buy more or less than 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. V2~the list of conditions that

contained the above condition had been signed by the Plaintiff~see page 75 of the appeal

brief. Nowhere did the Plaintiff say that he would not buy on this condition. It was the

seller's condition that they might increase the saleable stock of scrap Aluminium to be

3

...

above 10 metric tons but when the Plaintiff offered to buy by way of his tender (the bid)

dated 28.01.1988, he must be taken to have made his offer on the Defendant's

conditions, which the Plaintiff was well aware of.

No counter offer from the Plaintiff

He could have resiled from these conditions and made his offer on his own terms but he

did not. If he had had made an offer with his own conditions it would have amounted

to a counter offer. If he had specified as to how much he was willing to buy, that would

have also amounted to a counter offer. But the Plaintiff did not make such a counter

offer.

Acceptance of the offer to buy

After the Plaintiff had submitted the bid dated 28.01.1988, a letter dated 03.02.1988 was

sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff~see P3. This letter called upon the Plaintiff to pay

a sum of Rs. 657,951/~, which constituted the price for a total stock of 21 metric tons of

scrap Aluminium at the rate of Rs. 31,331/ ~ per metric ton. In other words the Defendant

was selling the Plaintiff 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. It was an acceptance of the

offer to buy 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium.

The letter directed him to deposit the sum (Rs. 657,9511~) with the District Accountant

of the Defendant Transport Board within 5 days of the receipt of the letter and remove

the stock within 14 days after payment. The letter also drew the attention of the

Plaintiff, more particularly to clause 6 of the list of conditions that had been given to

him~namely, he was liable to take on any amount of scrap aluminium, which could be

more or less than 10 metric tons. According to the Defendant, the contract of sale was

for 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium.

Response of the Plaintiff to P3

The Plaintiff responded to P3 (the letter of acceptance or awarding of the tender) by

making a payment of only a sum of Rs. 375,972/~. In other words he made a payment

only for a stock of 12 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. This payment had been made on

4

..

16.02.1988~see the receipt issued to the Plaintiff marked as P4. A little less than a week

later namely on 22.02.1988, the Southern Region Transport Board (the Defendant)

wrote to the Plaintiff that the tender that had been awarded to him was cancelled and

his deposit of Rs.375,9721 ~ could be refunded at the office of the District Accountant of

the Defendant.

The Plaintiff responded by despatching a letter dated 21.04.1988 (VB) and requested

that his deposit be reimbursed on or before 30.04.1988 and a legal officer of the legal

division of the Southern Region Transport Board wrote to the legal officer of the

Plaintiff by (V6) that the Defendant was willing to refund the money back to the

Plaintiff and he could come to have the reimbursement obtained on 29.04.1988 with

necessary documents.

Thus the documents speak for themselves and raise the issue of contract interpretation.

In the following year namely on 10.2.1989, the Plaintiff instituted this action against the

Defendant to recover a sum of Rs.1,33, 77501 ~, legal interest and further interest.

Based on the above facts, the question arises whether there was a contract between the

parties for a sale of 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium or more than that quantity. In

other words, did a contract for a sale of 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium come into

existence between the parties or was it only for a stock of 10 metric tons as the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle has found? One of the issues raised on behalf of the

Plaintiff was whether a contract existed between the parties for 10 metric tons~see Issue

No 3. This issue has been answered in the affirmative.

The Southern Region Transport Board (the Defendant) preferred this appeal against

the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle and as I said before, on

the facts established, principles of contract law surface to the fore in this case and in

my view the facts in this case could be compartmentalised within the notions of offer

and acceptance~two essential requisites to the validity of a contract between two

parties. Lord Wilberforce described the complementary ideas of offer, acceptance and

consideration thus: ~

5

..

"English Law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract,

in application takes a practical approach, often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into

the marked slots of offer, acceptance and consideration."~see New Zealand Shipping Co.

Ltd, v. A.M Satterthwaite & Co. Ltd, [1975] AC 154 at 167, [1974] 1 All ER

l0I5 at 1020.

Lord Wilberforce in the Privy Council in the above case which is also known sub nomine

The Eurymedon acknowledged that not all contractual situations are easily analysed

in terms of offer and acceptance, for example jumping on an (old style) London double~

decker bus~see The Eurymedon (supra) [1975] AC 154 at 167.

It is worth contrasting the view of Lord Wiberforce in the aforesaid Privy Council

decision that arose from New Zealand with that of Lord Diplock in the House of Lords'

decision in Gibson v. Manchester City Council CC [ 1979 ] 1 WLR 294. Lord Diplock

said in Gibson "there may be certain types of exceptional contracts which do not fit neatly into the

normal analysis of offer and acceptance but that the exchange of correspondence was not one of them."

In other words a straitjacket of offer and acceptance may prove elusive in certain types

of contract but it may not be so when contracts are concluded by an exchange of

letters.

In fact Steyn, LJ said in Trentham (Percy) Ltd v. Archital Luxfer [1993] 1 Uoyd's Rep

25 at 27 (CA):~

"Offer and Acceptance will in the vast majority of cases represent the mechanism of contract

formatiOn. It is so in the case of a contract alleged to have been made by an exchange of

correspondence. But it is not necessarily so in the case of a contract alleged to have come into

existence as a result of performance."

In my view this is a pragmatic affirmation from the English Courts that one needs to

apply the analysis of offer and acceptance in negotiations by correspondence and since

there has been an exchange of correspondence between the parties in this case, it is

once again apposite to itemise chronologically the transactions and correspondence

6

between the parties. I would also summarize my conclusions vis-a.-vis some of the

items. In a nutshell they would go as follows:-

PI. Paper advertisement calling for tender-this would amount to an invitation to

treat-This was in January 1988.

A standard form tender form (which finally became a perfected tenderlbid or

offer VI) and V2 were first obtained by the Plaintiff from the Defendant and the

standard form was thereafter filled and submitted as the offer to buy or the bid-VI. V2

contains a list of conditions.

VI. The Bid submitted by the Plaintiff having filled in the particulars that he was

making the offer to purchase scrap Aluminum at the rate of Rs.31,331/- per

metric ton. This would be the offer to buy. The Plaintiff specified no

quantity though.

V2. V2 contains Clause 6-a condition that the stock to be bought may rise above 10

metric tons.

P3. Letter by which the Defendant informed that the Plaintiff's offer to buy was

accepted for 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminum-Conclusion of the contract.

P4. The receipt that indicates that the Plaintiff paid only for 12 metric tons of scrap

Aluminum-Breach of contract by repudiation.

PS. 22.02.l988-the communication from the Defendant that the awarding of tender

was cancelled. The Plaintiff should collect his deposit of Rs. 375,972/- -The

repudiation was thus accepted and contract terminated by the Defendant.

V8. 21.04.l988-The Plaintiff's lawyer wrote to the Legal Officer, Southern Region

Transport Board calling for the refund of Rs. 375,972/- and this letter also

claims interest at 30 percent per annum on the said sum with effect from

01.05.l988, if the deposit is not refunded.

7

...

V6. 27.04.l988~the Legal Officer, Southern Region Transport Board wrote to the

Legal Officer for the Plaintiff stating that the Board had decided to refund the

money back to the Plaintiff.

Paper Advertisement~an invitation to treat

It is trite law that a paper advertisement calling for tenders in this case constituted an

invitation to treat. An invitation to treat occurs where one party (in this case Southern

Region Transport Board) invites the public to make an offer and the bid (tender)

submitted by the Plaintiff (VI) was really the offer to buy.

Codification of Contract Law~Restatements

Two leading academics in their superlative attempts to codify English contract law

published their Restatements in 2016, though in somewhat different formats and both

address basically the same audience of practitioners, judiciary, academics and students.

In his Contract Rules: Decoding English Law, Neil Andrews, Professor of Civil Justice and

Private Law, University of Cambridge pithily describes invitations to treat. He states

that unlike an offer, a mere invitation to treat is an opportunity for further dealings

before a contract can be formed~see Article 15 at page 28 in Contract Rules: Decoding English

Law by Neil Andrews (2016). In the other codification entided A Restatement of the English

Law of Contract (2016) by Andrew Burrows~ Professor of the Laws of England, University

of Oxford, he defines an invitation to treat in Article 7(4) as an expression, by words or

conduct, of a willingness to negotiate.

Article 7(5) itemises the following to be invitations to treat and not offers.

(a) Display of goods for sale;

(b) An advertisement of goods for sale;

( c) An invitation to tender.

As a general rule, a request for tenders is regarded as an invitation to treat so there is no

obligation to accept any of the tenders put forward. The tenders themselves are offers,

8

and a contract comes into existence when one of them is accepted~see Spencer v.

Harding(l869~1870) LR CP 561.

Thus the advertisement placed by the Defendant fell within Article 7 (5)(c) and the

perfected tender (VI) became the bid or offer to buy.

Apart from Spencer v. Harding (supra), for the proposition that every bid is an offer~see

The Law of Contract by Treitel (lIth edition, 2003 at p.3). Chitty on Contracts, 32nd Ed,

defines an offer as "an expression of willingness to contract on specified terms made

with the intention that it is to become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is

addressed" (para 2~003). Even Article 7(3) of A Restatement of the English Law of Contract

(2016) by Andrew Burrows defines offers as containing terms:~

An offer is an expression, by words or conduct, of a willingness to be bound by specified terms as

soon as there is acceptance by the person to whom the offer is made (,the offeree').

Then what are the terms on which the Plaintiff made his offer to purchase the scrap

Aluminium? By the time the Plaintiff made the offer, he had in his possession V2~the

list of conditions given by the Defendant, out of which clause 6 prescribed that the

stock to be purchased may rise above 10 metric tons. Other than these conditions that

the Plaintiff was in possession of, the Plaintiff did not prescribe or attach any

conditions of his own to the bid he was submitting and so he must be treated to have

made the offer on the terms of the Defendant namely the stocks to be bought may rise

above 10 metric tons. I must state that the conditions imposed by the Defendant in V2

were incorporated by reference into the offer made by the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff never testified that he had not read V2. This factor strengthens the

objective assessment that one has to make of the offer to purchase scrap Aluminium

namely it was made subject to the term that the offeree (the Defendant) might sell him

Aluminium above 10 metric tons. There was also no other condition which the Plaintiff

inserted in his own tender (offerlbid) to the effect that he was restricting his offer to

buy only up to 10 metric tons of Aluminium or 12 metric tons of Aluminium.

9

What was then the acceptance of this offer? By P3 dated 3rd February 1988 the

Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff that they were accepting the offer to buy, which was

fixed at 20 metric tons of Aluminium. When the Defendant thus wrote to the Plaintiff

by P3, a contract came into being for the sale of 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The

attention of the Plaintiff was drawn in P3 to clause 6 of the list of conditions.

A contract, being a legally enforceable agreement thus bound the Plaintiff to a contract

of sale for 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminium at the rate of Rs.31,33I1 - per metric ton.

But on 16th February 1988 the Plaintiff made a payment of only a sum of Rs.3,75,972/-,

which was the price for a stock of 12 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The contract of

sale was entered into for 20 metric tons but the Plaintiff paid for only 12 metric tons of

scrap Aluminium. What was the import of this underpayment?

In my view, there was a breach of contract of sale for 20 metric tons of scrap

Aluminium that had already come into existence between the Plaintiff and the

Defendant. A contract is said to be breached when one party performs defectively,

differently from the agreement, or not at all (actual breach), or indicates in advance

that they will not be performing as agreed (anticipatory breach).

Here was a contract which mandated the Plaintiff to pay for 20 metric tons of scrap

Aluminium, but he paid only for 12 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. This constitutes an

actual breach of the contract.

Effect of Breach

When there is a breach of contract, whether it be actual or anticipatory, the contract is

not automatically discharged. The innocent party can usually choose whether or not to

terminate. As Viscount Simon stated in Heyman v. Darwins Ltd, (1942) AC 356;

(1942) 1 All ER 337 (HL):-

"Repudiation by one party standing alone does not terminate the contract. It takes two to end it,

by repudiatiOn, on the one side, and acceptance of the repudiatiOn, on the other."

10

...

In other words, a breach entitling a party to terminate a contract does not

automatically cause the contract to be terminated. Instead, the innocent party has a

choice ("the right to elect"): he can choose to terminate the contract ("accept the

renunciation or repudiation") and sue for damages, or he can affirm the contract and

sue for damages or, where appropriate, debt (on the latter when a contract has been

kept alive). The House of Lords in 'The Simona' (1989) AC 788 confirmed the

fundamental proposition that where a party's breach justifies the innocent party in

terminating the contract, the latter has a choice: he can accept the repudiation and thus

terminate the contract and sue for damages, or he can affirm the contract and sue for

damages. Neil Andrews points out in Article 163 of his Contract Rules: Decoding English

Law that there is an exception to this "elective" or non-automatic termination in the

context of insurance contracts-see page 302.

A majority of the House of Lords in White & Carter v. McGregor (1962) AC 413 held

that the innocent party might sometimes have the capacity to keep open the contract

(the right to 'affirm the contract'), and complete his side of the bargain. He can then sue

for the agreed price. But there are later cases that have qualified this and prevented the

innocent party from burdening the other party with unwanted performance-see

Isabella Shipowner SA v. Shagang Shipping Co. Ltd, ('The Aquafaith ') 2012

EWHC 1077 (Comm).

So in this instance the repudiation of the contract came in the way of an underpayment

for 12 metric tons, quite contrary to the actual quantity agreed upon by the parties. But

the innocent party being the Southern Transport Board (the Defendant) did not want

to affirm the contract and sue for damages: rather they chose to accept the renunciation

or repudiation and terminate the contract. Their response was to cancel the tender.

The Defendant Board intimated to the Plaintiff by a letter dated 22.02.l988 (P5) that

the contract was at an end. By way of P5 the Plaintiff was informed that the tender that

had been awarded to him was cancelled. He was further instructed to collect his

deposit of Rs.3,75,972/- from the accountant. Unfortunately the learned Additional

11

..

District Judge of Galle treated the underpayment as a performance of the contract by

the Plaintiff, a reasoning which does not stand to reason having regard to the facts and

law.

The underpayment amounted to a renunciation or repudiation of the contract on the

part of the Plaintiff and the Defendant had a choice whether to accept it and sue him

for damages or affirm the contract and sue him for damages. The Defendant chose the

former but he did not proceed to sue. Ironically the contact breaker became the

Plaintiff in this case. The repudiation by the Plaintiff by way of an underpayment and

its acceptance by the Defendant brought about the termination for breach. Article 163

of Neil Andrews' Contract Rules, Decoding English Law explains how the decision to

terminate for breach could be manifested.

(i) Exercise of the choice by the innocent party whether to affirm or to terminate

the contract requires no particular form. However, the innocent party must

successfully communicate his decision to the guilty party, or at least that party

must be left in no possible doubt from the circumstances concerning the

innocent party's decision.

(li) The decision to affirm or to terminate can be manifested (a) expressly or (b)

impliedly. In situation (b), the innocent party's decision can be inferred from

conduct, exceptionally, even from silence, but only if the inference can be

clearly and safely be drawn from the relevant context.

The letter cancelling the tender dated 22nd February 1988 which is plain as a pikestaff

clearly manifested the decision of the Defendant to terminate the contract.

The Plaintiff too affirmed this position further by his Attorney,at,Law writing to the

legal officer, Southern Region Transport Board that in addition to the refund of

Rs.3,75,1972/, he would seek interest at 30 percent per annum on the said sum. In other

words, except for the element of interest that the Plaintiff was seeking, he could not

have been in doubt as to the termination of the contract. Again by V6 dated 27.04.1988,

the legal officer, Southern Region Transport Board wrote to the legal officer for the

12

..

Plaintiff that the Board was willing to refund the money back to the Plaintiff. This

letter did not though respond to the question of interest, which the Plaintiff had

demanded.

Remedies

An award of damages is the usual remedy for a breach of contract. It is an award of

money that aims to compensate the innocent party for the financial losses they have

suffered as a result of the breach. I have taken the view that it is the Southern Region

Transport Board that suffered as a result of the breach of contract occasioned by the

Plaintiff. But it was the Plaintiff who came to Court and won an award of damages in

his favour.

The learned Additional District Judge of Galle took the view that the contract of sale

between the parties was only for 10 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. This is a

conclusion which he could not have reached having regard to the fact that the Plaintiff

paid for 12 metric tons of scrap Aluminium. The learned Additional District Judge of

Galle fell into error when he quite erroneously treated the underpayment as

performance. It was a defective performance which amounted to a breach of the

contract to pay for 21 metric tons of scrap Aluminium.

I have taken the view having regard to the contractual principles of offer and

acceptance that the offer to buy incorporated the condition that the buyer (the

Plaintiff) was consenting to buy the increased quantity of 20 metric tons that the seller

decided upon and when the Defendant wrote P3 dated 3rd February 1988, the offer to

buy was accepted for a sale of 20 metric tons of scrap Aluminium.

If, as the learned Additional District Judge concluded that the contract was for 10

metric tons, it begs the question~i.e., why did the Defendant pay for 12 metric tons of

scrap Aluminium? The Defendant could have affirmed the contract by accepting the

underpayment and sued the Defendant for damages. The Defendant did not proceed to

do so and instead they wrote to the Plaintiff requesting him to take back the money.

This was an acceptance of the repudiation of the contract by the contract breaker, who

13

a-

in my view was the Plaintiff. The Defendant quite unequivocally treated the contract as

discharged and it was so treated as at an end.

None of these principles were borne in mind by the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle and thus there was a misdirection of facts and law that vitiates the judgment

dated 07.04.1999. The pleadings disclose that the Plaintiff has already obtained the

deposits that he had made with the Accountant of the Defendant and thus the

Defendant does not have to make any restitution to the Plaintiff~see paragraph 14 of the

amended answer dated 10th October 1991. If at all, the common law remedy of damages

was available only to the Defendant Board and not to the Plaintiff. The Defendant

though did not choose to sue the Plaintiff for damages nor has it sought any damages in

the answer. Once again the want of a cross claim for damages in the answer is no doubt

traceable to a misappreciation of the principles of contract law on the part of the

pleader. The amended answer has only sought the dismissal of the plaint. The Plaintiff

had no cause of action to institute this action against the Defendant as he was clearly in

breach of his contractual obligations.

For the reasons stated above, I set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Galle dated oth April 1999 and proceed to allow the appeal with costs.
