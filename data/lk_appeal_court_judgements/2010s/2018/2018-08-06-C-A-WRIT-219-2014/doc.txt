The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to seek a mandate

in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash the findings of the Arbitral Award made

by the 3rd Respondent dated 02/01/2014, marked P10, as contained in the

Government Gazette Notification No. 1848125, dated 06/02/2014, marked PI1,

3

and to quash the reference made by the 1 st Respondent to the 3rd Respondent under

Section 4( 1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

When this matter was take up for argument the parties agreed to proceed on

the following grounds of reference.

(a) Since the 4th Respondent has retired on a Voluntary Retirement Scheme

(VRS), is there any ground for Arbitration?

(b) Did the Arbitrator act ultra vires when deciding to refer the matter to

Arbitration.

The facts of the case briefly are as follows;

The 4th Respondent was appointed to the post of Book Keeper Grade VI, at

the Petitioner authority on 03/01/1983. On 23/09/1989 the 4th Respondents

employment with the said authority was terminated on the ground of misconduct.

The said Respondent thereafter, filed an application at the Labour Tribunal of

Ratnapura for re-instatement to the said post. By order dated 12/08/1998, the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal dismissed the application filed by the

said Respondent. By order dated 18/12/2000, the Provincial High Court, allowed

the appeal and ordered re-instated of the 4th Respondent with back wages.

However, the Petitioner re-instated the 4th Respondent without due promotions. By

letter dated 24/04/2002, the 4th Respondent has requested the Petitioner that he be

re-instated as Assistant Accountant Grade V and VI respectively, as at the relevant

4

dates. Due to the failure on the part of the authority to act fully on the said

determination, a compliant was made to the Human Rights Commission HRC, and

the HRC by its order dated 15/07/2005, recommended that the said promotions be

affected on the due dates. Since the Petitioner Authority did not comply with the

said recommendation, the 4th Respondent complained to the 2nd Respondent, the

Commissioner of Labor, and the matter was thereafter referred to Arbitration by

the 1 st Respondent.

It is observed that in the latter part of year 2004, the 4th Respondent applied

for retirement under the VRS, offered to the employees of the Petitioner Authority.

The 4th Respondent submits that he accepted the said retirement without prejudice

to his rights to pursue with the complaint made to the HRC, and his retirement

entitlements. In support, the 4th Respondent has drawn attention to documents

marked 4R2 (b) and 4R 3, pleaded in the statement of objections filed of record.

The Petitioner by circular dated 08/10/2004, marked P6, has called for

applications for VRS from all employees. The 4th Respondent by his application

dated 22/10/2004, marked P7, has accepted the VRS conditional to that he has no

further claims from the Petitioner, as reflected in the last paragraph of the said

application. Therefore, the Petitioner deny any further claim for relief by the 4th

Respondent.

5

In this background, before looking into the decision to refer this matter to

arbitration, I will proceed to deal with documents marked 4 R2 (b) and 4 R3 which

the 4th Respondent claims that gives him the right to accept the VRS "subject to

his entitlements and rights". It is important to note that the 4th Respondents

application to the Commissioner of Labour was based on the said documents, in

which the 4th Respondent claimed gave him a right to invoke relief by reference to

Arbitration.

The Petitioner submits that the 4th Respondent made an application in terms

of the said circular marked P6, for a VRS, by application marked P7, which was

duly accepted by the Petitioner. As contained in paragraph 6 of the statement of

objections, the Respondent has relied on the said application for VRS to advance

his stand at the Arbitration proceedings. However, having relied on the said

application marked P7, the Respondent in his statement of objections has failed to

explain adequately, the existence of document marked 4R2 (b), which he claims to

indicate that the VRS was submitted without prejudice to his rights and

entitlements as claimed in the said document. In the same paragraph the

Respondent has pleaded a document marked 4R2 (a), which is not filed of record.

By application marked P7, dated 22/10/2004, the Respondent has clearly

accepted the VRS with no further claims from the Petitioner, and as such the said

application was duly accepted by the Petitioner. The application dated 06109/2004,

6

marked 4R2 (b) was submitted before the application for VRS, marked P7. In the

circumstances, it is clear that the 4th Respondent accepted the said VRS with no

further claims from the Petitioner as reflected in the last paragraph of the said

application, and therefore the 4th Respondent should be denied of any further

claim.

I also note the following in respect of documents marked 4R2 (b) and 4R3;

Document marked 4R2 (b) dated 06/09/2004, is a photo copied document

which has not been duly certified. The space where the Petitioner

Authority endorses the application to certify acceptance of application is

left blank. The said document bears a rubber stamp of the Petitioner

Authority which is dated 27/08/2004, which is a date prior to the date of

. the purported application.

Document marked 4R3 dated 03112/2004, is also a photo copy which is

not duly certified. The said document has no endorsement of acceptance

by the Petitioner Authority. There is also no clear date of

acknowledgement of the document by the Petitioner.

As observed above, the 4th Respondent has failed to certify the copies of the

documents annexed to the Petition and therefore, has not complied with rule 3 (1)

(a) of the Court of Appeal rules of 1990, which amounts to a fatal irregularity.

7

For all the above reasons, I hold that documents marked 4R2 (b) and 4R3,

cannot be relied upon to justify the 4th Respondents purported rights and

entitlements and as such, are rejected. Therefore, I find that the Petitioners

application has merit and should be allowed.

Therefore, in the absence of any ground for reference to Arbitration, I hold

that the said reference is bad in law and therefore, I issue a mandate in the nature

of writ of Certiorari to quash the reference made by the 1 st Respondent in terms of

section 4( 1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, contained in document marked PI 0,

and also to quash the Arbitral award made by the 3rd Respondent as contained in

Gazette Notification marked P 11, as prayed for in terms of paragraph (b) and (c)

of the Petition.

Petition is allowed without costs.
