The appellant was charged under section 296 of the Penal Code

for the murder of one Laffir Sumaitha Banu on 20105/2006. After trial he

was convicted for the said offence and sentenced to death.

The deceased who was a nine years old girl was found missing in

the morning on 20105/2006. After 6 days her body was found buried in

the compound of the appellant. It appears from the evidence that the

appellant had been working in the bakery belonging to prosecution

witness number one, father of the deceased. His services were

terminated by the father. He has met the appellant on 12/05/2006, he has

inquired from prosecution witness number one whether he had memories

of any unforgettable incidents in his life. And when prosecution witness

number one answered in the negative the appellant is alleged to have

asked if someone kidnapped his child will that be an unforgettable

incident? Thereafter the prosecution witness number one has told the

appellant that no one will dare not enter his house as there is a dog in his

house.

conviction and sentence dated 10/10/2008 is affirmed.
