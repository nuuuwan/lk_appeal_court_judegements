The Petitioner - Respondent - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Petitioner) has made an application to the Magistrate's Court of

Colombo seeking a mandatory order from the learned Magistrate under

section 28 A (3) of the Urban Development Law (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as UDA Law), to demolish an unauthorized construction. This

was pursuant to the Respondent- Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Respondent) defaulting the compliance with a

notice issued under section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law.

As the Respondent has failed to attend Court on summons, the Petitioners

had taken steps to serve summons on the Respondent by way of

substituted service also. A report to this effect had also been filed in the

Magistrate's Court by the fiscal. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate having

considered the material before him, had pronounced his order dated 2013-

03-08, granting power to the Respondent, under section 28 A (3) of the

UDA Law, to demolish the said construction.

After the learned Magistrate delivered the order, the Petitioner having filed

a motion in the Magistrate's Court, had obtained permission of Court to

implement the order dated 2013-03-12. Accordingly, the fiscal had carried

out the said order and filed a report in that regard in Court on 2013-03-18.

The Provincial High Court of Western Province holden at Colombo, upon

an application for revision filed by the Respondent, has by its order dated

2016-09-13, directed that a course of action had arisen for the Respondent

to recover compensation and to file separate action in a Court of law for

recovery of damages and compensation.

This Court observes that the fundamental basis upon which the learned

Provincial High Court Judge had proceeded to arrive at the impugned

conclusion, is the alleged failure to serve summons on the Respondent.

However, this Court is of the view that the learned Provincial High Court

Judge had clearly misdirected himself when he had concluded that the

Petitioners had defaulted serving summons at least by way of substituted

service. The record bears testimony to the fact that the Petitioner indeed

has served the summons on the Respondent by way of substituted service.

The journal entries dated 2013-02-15, 2013-03-08 make this position

amply clear. Unfortunately, the learned Provincial High Court Judge had

failed to focus his attention on them. In these circumstances, this Court is

of the view that the order dated 2016-09-13 pronounced by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge is clearly erroneous and therefore should not

be permitted to stand.

Further, this Court is unable to find any basis upon which the learned

Provincial High Court Judge could have concluded that the Respondent had

acted within law in constructing the impugned construction and interfered

with the order granted by the learned Magistrate to demolish the said

unauthorized construction. In any case, the said construction has now been

demolished.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to set aside the order dated

2016-09-13 of the Provincial High Court Judge and proceed to restore all

the orders made by the learned Magistrate with regard to the said

demolition of the said unauthorized construction.

Appeal is allowed.
