({jn this action instituted by a wife (the Plaintiff-Appellant, hereinafter sometimes J referred to as the "the Plaintiff") on 20.05.1997 against her husband (Defendant-

Respondent, hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") the Plaintiff sought

a dissolution of her marriage with the Defendant.

The plaintiff's case was that she married the Defendant on 12.09.1972 and there were

three children born out of this marriage. She alleged in her plaint that;

1. the Defendant neglected her and the matrimonial home;

2. the Defendant was callous of the plaintiff's feelings;

3. the Defendant constantly quarreled and abused her in the presence of outsiders

and the children;

4. the Defendant did not heed any reasonable request of the Plaintiff and his

conduct brought an end to the marriage.

As a result of the above conduct of the Defendant, she averred that on 30.11.1994, she

was compelled to leave the matrimonial home with the children and that the Defendant

was guilty of constructive malicious desertion.

She sought a divorce a vinculo matrimonii on the ground of constructive malicious

desertion, a sum of Rs.75,000/- as alimony and the legal and physical custody of the

three children.

2

The basis of the plaintiff's claim was that her husband's conduct was such as to amount

to constructive malicious desertion which brought an end to the marriage.

The Defendant on the other hand denied all allegations of the Plaintiff and stated that

immediately after the marriage they had been living in the U.K. and after returning to

Sri Lanka, they were living together and in the latter part of 1994 his business suffered

loss and due to this reason they mutually agreed to shift their living to the plaintiff's

parental home at No.27/3, Chandraleka Mawatha, Colombo 8.

After the said house was sold in 1998, the Defendant stayed in a room which could not

accommodate the entire family, but he regularly visited the Plaintiff and children and

took them out as well. He further stated that he was still attached to the Plaintiff and

children and he wanted to live with them happily. It would appear therefore that the

Defendant denied constructive malicious desertion and he was on good terms with the

children.

According to the plaint, the first child was born in 1976, the second in 1981 and the

third was in 1986. As one could see, the births of the children had been sexennial. In

other words the three children had been born once every six years. This is indicative of

the fact that both the Plaintiff and Defendant had enjoyed conjugal bliss and had been

in good family relationship until 1986. The Defendant expressed his willingness to

return to the Plaintiff in order to resume cohabitation thus displaying animus revertendi.

When the trial was taken up on 15.02.1999, the Plaintiff raised the following two issues:

namely:~

1. As per the matters mentioned in paragraph 5 of the plaint, on or about 30.11.1994,

was the Plaintiff compelled to leave the matrimonial home?

2. If so, is the Plaintiff entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the plaint?

The Defendant did not raise any issue. At the trial only the Plaintiff had given evidence

on her behalf and no other witnesses were called to support her story. At least the first

daughter who was 23 years old in 1999, and had been living with the Plaintiff, could

3

have been summoned to give evidence if the plaintiffs allegations against the Defendant

had been true.

If the Plaintiff left the matrimonial home with her children on 31.11.1994, why did she

wait almost three years to institute this action on the ground of constructive malicious

desertion on the part of the Defendant? This is an irresistible question one is driven to

pose. The Plaintiff has not given any acceptable reason for this unusual delay. The only

reason given was that she wanted to discuss the matter with the children when they

had grown up. This is not an acceptable answer for the delay which this Court could

countenance. It shows that she too wanted the marriage to continue.

It is to be noted that even after the separation in November, 1994, the Plaintiff and the

Defendant, on many occasions, had been seen together. The Plaintiff has admitted these

events in her evidence under cross-examination. Firstly, she admitted that even after

the separation she had gone with her children and lived with the Defendant. She had

attended birthday parties with the Defendant. She had also gone to see a doctor with

the Defendant. This conduct on the part of the parties would show that neither of them

wanted to end their nuptial tie.

In the case of Rajeswararanee v. Sunthararasa, (1962) 64 N.LR. 366, Basanayake c.J.

observed at page 369:

"Although the parties were at variance as to where they should reside there was no intention on

the part of either to break up the marriage because they were willing to continue to live as

husband and wife".

This observation aptly applies to the instant case.

The testimony of the Plaintiff demonstrates that she went to her parents' house

because of financial difficulties the Defendant had, but it would be common ground

that a wife for this reason alone would not leave the husband for the abode of her

parents. There may be ups and downs and crests and troughs in life but it is an eternal

verity that at all times both parties would live together, shoulder the difficulties and

carry on in the interests of the children.

4

According to the evidence of the Plaintiff it is clear that though she had gone to her

parents' home with the children, she would often come to see the Defendant at his

place of abode during weekends. In front of society they comported themselves as

husband and wife without manifesting their differences. Did they put in an appearance

of a Darby and Joan? Yet the learned District Judge of Colombo did not believe the

plaintiff's story of constructive malicious desertion on the grounds she had urged in

paragraph 4 of the plaint. After having considered the evidence of the Plaintiff, the

learned District Judge has refused the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff. This appeal is

against that judgment dated 23.09.2000.

In my view the grounds averred by the Plaintiff in paragraph 4 of the plaint have not

been established by sufficient evidence. The subsequent conduct of both parties after

the alleged constructive desertion on 30.11.1994, clearly indicates that there was no

factum of constructive malicious desertion that could be deduced from any act on the

part of the Defendant. I would observe that there is not any tittle of evidence suggestive

of the fact that the Defendant ever neglected the welfare of his children.

In the event that the husband was at fault in driving the wife out of the matrimonial

home, the bona fide attempts made by the husband for reconciliation cannot be ignored

lightly. A Divisional Bench of the Supreme Court declared in Muthukumaraswamy v.

Parameshwary(1976) 78 N.LR. 488:

"T ennination of malicious desertion can take place by a supervening animus revertendi, coupled

with a bona fide approach to the deserted spouse with a view to resumption of life together.

Where the deserting spouse makes a genuine offer to return to the matrimonial home with a view

to resumption of life together, the deserted spouse cannot lawfully refuse reinstatement. A

deserted spouse must always, until the presentation of his plaint, affirm the marriage and be

ready to take back the deserting spouse."~ (per Sharvananda, J. [as he then was] with

Thomotheram, J. and Ratwatte, J. concurring)

Considering the evidence led in this case, I am of the view that the Defendant had

always demonstrated his animus revertendi with the intention of living together with the

5

Plaintiff and the children, and the Plaintiff has failed to establish constructive malicious

desertion on the part of the Defendant.

I therefore affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge and dismiss the appeal

without costs.
