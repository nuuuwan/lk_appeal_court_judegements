ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") against an order of dismissal of

his revision application filed before the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo bearing No. HCRA 10/06. In the

said application, the Appellant sought to revise an order made by the

Magistrate's Court of Mt. Lavinia upon an application of the Applicant-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent")

under Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Act No. 41 of 1978 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the said" Act").

2

The Respondent, in making the said application sought an order

under Section 28A(3) in respect of a development activity effected by the

Appellant in constructing buildings of 12 x 10 feet and 10 x 10 feet at the

premises bearing assessment Nos. 5 and 5A of Templers Road, Mt Lavinia.

At the inquiry before the Magistrate's Court, the Appellant only

contended that the Respondent has no Locus Standi to initiate such

proceedings as Dehiwala Mt Lavinia Municipal Council instead of Urban

Development Authority. This objection was overruled by the Magistrate's

Court and it had thereafter made order under Section 28A(3).

The Appellant, in his petition addressed to the Provincial High

Court, had reiterated his contention that the Respondent had no Locus

Standi. He had then, in paragraph 6, referred to a plan marked as "XII"

and stated that it was tendered to the Magistrate's Court by way of a

motion dated 12.12.2005.

However, the Appellant only in his submissions before the

Provincial High Court, raised a new ground that the Magistrate's Court

had failed to consider the approved plan for the development activity

tendered before it, marked as "XII".

3

The Provincial High Court, in its order had dealt with the issue

raised by the Appellant in relation to standing of the Respondent against

him and proceeded to dismiss his application.

In his submissions addressed to this Court, the Appellant now

concedes that the Respondent had standing to institute action against him

before the Magistrate's Court. The only ground of appeal he now raises

against the order of dismissal by the Provincial High Court and the order

of the Magistrate's Court is that it had failed to consider the document

marked "XII".

It must be noted that whether the development activity which gave

rise to the application under Section 28A(3), had already been approved by

the Respondent as the relevant municipal authority and whether the

Appellant constructed his building in conformity with the said approved

plan are questions of fact or at the most, mixed questions of fact and law.

It is also noted by this Court that the Appellant raises this question of

having prior approval to the development activity for the first time before

the Provincial High Court in his written submissions. This is not a ground

raised in his petition tendered before the Provincial High Court. He

contended in his written submissions tendered to that Court that" XII also

shows that the relevant building is a pre-existing building and that the building

application had been approved by none other than the mayor of Dehiwala Mt

Lavinia Municipal Council."

The Supreme Court, having considered the judicial precedents of

Talagala v. Gangodawila Co-operative Stores Society Ltd. (1947) 48

N.L.R. 472, Setha v. Weerakoon (1948) 49 N.L.R. 225, The Tasmania (1980)

15 A.C. 223, Appuhamy v. Nona (1912) 15 N.L.R. 311, Manian v.

Sanmugam (1920) 22 N.L.R. 249 and Arulampikai v. Thambu (1944) 45

N.L.R. 457 in its judgment of Gunawardena v Deraniyagala and Others

(2010) 1 Sri L.R. 309 concluded that;

II On an examination of all these decisions, it is abundantly clear

that according to our procedure, it is not open to a party to put

fonvard a ground for the first time in appeal, if the said point has

not been raised at the trial under the issues so framed. The

appellate Courts may consider a point raised for the first time in

appeal, where the point might have been put forward in the Court

below under one of the issues raised and where the Court has

before it all the material that is required to decide the question. "

In view of this clear determination by the apex Court, the

Appellant's contention that he had an already approved building plan for

the development activity complained of by the Respondent should not be

considered by the Provincial High Court or by this Court since he had

raised it for the first time in appeal.

Even if the document Xll is considered by the Magistrate's Court, it

had no effect on its order. The said building plan was approved on 20th

August 1991. The proposed building for which approval was granted is 12

5

x 5 feet in its dimensions. The Respondent's sketch of the unauthorised

development activity shows that the dimensions of two buildings are 12 x

10 feet. This sketch is dated 18th February 2005. There was no Certificate of

Conformity in relation to Xll is obtained by the Appellant for 14 years.

Therefore, Xll has no direct relevance to the development activity

complained before the Magistrate's Court by the Respondent.

In addition, this Court notes with concern the manner in which the

document marked Xll had found its way into the case record of the

Magistrate's Court. The motion is dated 12th December 2005. The previous

date on which the case was called is indicated as 9th December 2005 and

the next date is indicated as 6th January 2006, the day on which the

impugned order was pronounced. In the hand-written part of the

objections/ submissions of the Appellant to the Magistrate's Court, he only

referred to document marked X8. The motion merely requested Court to

accept documents X9 to Xll and to file them of record. No request has

been made to Court for it to be treated as supporting documents to his

submissions. The Appellant did not produce the journal entry of 12th

December 2005. Therefore, it is not clear whether there was any

application made by the Appellant to tender additional documents on that

day or whether the Court had allowed the Appellant to tender such

additional documents. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that

the Appellant merely filed those documents in the case record without

obtaining prior permission from Court and had tendered them after the

Court had fixed the matter for order. Having adopted such an irregular

procedure to introduce documents without even giving notice to the 6

, .

opposing party or to Court, the Appellant complained to the Provincial

High Court, and that too only in his written submissions, the Magistrate's

Court had failed to consider Xll.

In view of the forgoing, we are of the view that the appeal of the

Appellant is devoid of any merit. The Respondent sought to dismiss the

appeal of the Appellant with costs.

Accordingly, the appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs. 10,000.00.
