A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J.

This case throws up the usual occurrence of a dismissal of an

action for non app~arance of the plaintiff and the ensuing

1 tiga tion all the way to the Court of App'eal to have the lis

restored back to the trial roll. As one goes back in time, the

Plaintiff's case was dismissed for non appearance as far back as

08.10.1997. Though the plaintiff who was living overseas in the

United States was absent on 08.10.1997-a date specially fixed for

trial, there was present in court his counsel along with the

instructing attorney and the counsel dutifully made submissions

as to why the plaintiff was not present on the day in question.

The counsel for the plaintiff had submitted that there was a long

llPage

distance call made t.o the instructing attorney by the plaintiff

from the United States, wherein the plaintiff had informed the

instructing attorney that he was not in a proper state of health

to travel the long distance by air and the counsel implored Court

that if the plaintiff was granted reasonable time he would be

able to produce a medical certificate to this effect. The counsel

further submitted before the learned additional District Judge of

Mt. Lavinia that a material witness Mr. Alex Jayasekera could be

led on the day

plaintiff.

and thereafter they could lead evidence of the

The learned counsel for the plaintiff in other words suggested to

the learned additional District Judge that he was left with two

alternatives. Firstly, he would lead the evidence of Mr. Alex

Jayasekera on the day in que.=. tion and thereafter the plaintiff

would be led or otherwise he would move for a date to lead the

evidence of the plaintiff on the next date. It was in those

circumstances that an application for a postponement was made on

the trial date. However, this application did not find favor with

the learned Addiltional District Judge of Mt. Lavinia as he

rejected the application for the postponement and dismissed the

plaintiff's action on 8.10.1997.

The thrust of the reasoning of the learned Additional District

Judge to dismiss the plaint seems to be that the sudden illness of

21Page

the plaintiff could not be established before court. The learned

District Judge seems to have been influneced in his decision to

take up the case i~~ediately on the premise that the case had been

fixed for two days on the application of the counsel for the

plaintiff and also because the counsel for the defendant objected

to the application of the plaintiff's counsel for a date. It has

to be noted that when a Regist8red Attorney or an attorney at law

instructed by the Registered Attorney represents a party to an

action in court, it has to be treated as if that particular party

is present in court, because the representation of a party in court

by an attorney at law is in a representative capacity as the proxy

filed on behalf of the party clearly demonstrates the principal-

agent relationship between them and it is trite law that an agent

is authorized by the instrument of authorization (proxy in this

case) to act on behalf of a principal. Section 24 of the Civil

Procedure Code makes this position quite clear-See the comparable

observation to this effect of Camini Amarathunga, J. in Al.ima Umma

Vs. Siyaneris 2006 1 Sri.LR 32.

Though there exists no right of appeal against any judgement

entered upon default in terms of Section 88 (1) of the Civil

Procedure Code, the order setting aside or refusing to set aside

the judgement entered upon default is liable to an appeal in terms

of Section 88 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

When this case was dismissed by the learned Additional District

Judge of Mt. Lavinia, the plaintiff filed an application by way

of a petition and affidavit to have the dismissal set aside on

06.11.1997-Vide Pages 201-209 of the appeal brief. This court

also takes note of the fact that the motion accompaning the

petition and affidavit dated 06.11.1997 is day stamped by the

Registry of the District Court of Mt. Lavinia bn 06.11.1997 itself.

The motion clearly moves that the substituted defendant be noticed

for the inquiry to be held under Section 87 (3) of the Civil

Procedure Code. The inquiry to purge default was held on

26.01.2000. At the inquiry held on 26.01.2000, the plaintiff

gave evidence testifying as to why he could not come for the trial

on 08.10.1997. At the inquiry, the plaintiff stated that he was

expecting to fly to Sri Lanka from the United States on 06.10.1997.

But he met with a serious accident on 04.10.1997 and as a result

of this accident, he was unconcious for nearly 3-4 days. The

plaintiff also produced an air ticket which he had purchased to

travel to Sri Lanka-vide page 210 of the appeal brief.

However, the learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia delivered his

judgement on 12.12.2000 refusing to set aside the judgement that

had been entered upon default. It has to be noted that the Section

87 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code states that if the Court is

satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for the non appearance

of the plaintiff, the court shall make order setting aside the

dismissal.

In the course of rejecting the application to set aside the order

made upon default, I must observe that the learned District Judge

misdirected himself on the law and facts. In the case of Rev.

Sumanathissa Vs. Harry 2009 1 Sri.LR 31, this Court has laid down

that the Court must apply a liberal approach in determining whether

the plaintiff has satisfied court in adducing reasonable grounds

for non appearance. In other words the court alluded to the

yardstick of a subjective test rather than a less flexible

objective test in determining what is reasonable. The District

Court has misdirected itself in not having' considered the fact

that the plaintiff had given evidence on an earlier occasion when

this case was taken up at an ex-parte trial owing to the absence

of the defendant. This salient feature demonstates the diligence

manifested by the plaintiff to prosecute his action against the

defendant and there was an ex parte judgement and decree entered

in favour of the plaintiff in the case until the decree was set

aside upon an application made by the defendant.

Before a District Judge proceeds to dismiss an action filed by the

Plaintiff, he has to have regard to the past conduct of the

Plaintiff such as his presence in court on earlier occasions. The

Court should not visit the plaintiff with a stringent sanction

SIPage

such as a dismissal of his plaint if there had been due dilgence

shown on previous occasions but the plaintiff gets absent

thereafter on a solitary occasion. The fact that the plaintiff

has not exhibitted a blatant or wilfull disregard for the process

of court is a salient factor that the learned District Judge must

take into account before he mechanically and routinely dismisses

an action filed by the plaintiff. In an appeal under Section

88(1) of the Civil Procedure Code it is open to this court to have

regard to the circumstances in which the court dismissed the

plaintiff's action.

This is a case in which the learned District Judge couldn't have

dismissed the plaintiff's action at all when his counsel instructed

by an attorney at law was present in court and suggested

alternatives such as leading evidence of a material witness for

the plaintiff. In such a situation, the learned District Judge

should have framed the issues and begun the trial or if the

plaintiff was necessary he should have granted a date to the

plaintiff's Counsel.

In this context what Justice Mark Fernando stated in regard to

Section 91 (a) of the Civil Procedure Code in ABN AMRO Bank Vs.

Conmix (Private) Limited and Others (1996)1 Sri.LR 08 is apposite.

In this case, the learned Judge suggested that Section 91 (a)

empowers court to grant further time to a defendant and this is so

61Page

I l I

even if the plaintiff objects. This rationale has to be borne in

mind by Judges of the original court before they proceed to

dismiss actions or fix cases ex-parte in situations when such

orders could not be made at all.

In the circumstances, this court is of the view that the judgement

dated 12.12.2000 of the learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia

refusing to set aside the order made upon default has to be set

aside. The initial order dismissing the plaintiff's action on

08.10.1997 was per incuriam as the Counsel for the plaintiff was

present and moved for a date or even indicated that he was willing

to lead the evidence of a witness. In such a si tua tion the

plaintiff could not have been treated as if he was in default.

In those circumstances the District Court could not have made an

order of dismissal. The order was a nullity and though the

plaintiff erroneously invoked Section 87 (3) of the Code, those

proceedings too were a nullity and therefore the order of the

learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia dated 12.12.2000 refusing to

set aside the order of dismissal dated 8.10.1997 is also null and

void and is of no force or avail in law.

\\ If an act in law is void, then it is in law a nulli ty .... There

is no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is

automatically null and void without much ado, though it is

sometimed convenient to have the court declare it to be so.

And every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and

incurably bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect

it to stay there. It will collapse."-see Lord Denning in the

Privy Council, McFoy v United Arica Company Ltd, (1961) 3

AER 1169, 1172.

In the circumstances I proceed to set aside the impugned order of

the learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia dated 12.12.2000 and I

make further order restoring this case back to the trial roll to

be taken up in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia.

The learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia is directed to re-

commence the trial from the stage where it was dismissed namely by

framing issues and permitting the plaintiff to place his case

before Court.

The Registrar is directed to transmit a copy of this order along

with the original record forthwith to the District Court of Mt.

Lavinia. Having regard to the circumstances of this case, I make

no order as to costs.

The appeal is therefore allowed.
