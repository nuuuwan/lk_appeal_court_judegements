The Accused was the driver of the vehicle at the time of detection. He was arrested for transporting timber without a valid permit. He was charged in the Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya under the Forest Ordinance. The Accused pleaded guilty to the charged and accordingly he was sentenced. Thereafter, an inquiry was held with regard to the confiscation of the lorry. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate confiscated the lorry bearing No. 226-6075. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner sought to revise the same in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya, where the said revision application was dismissed. The contention of the Petitioner was that he gave the vehicle to a relative who was the Accused for the purpose of selling the above mentioned lorry. The said vehicle was kept in the custody with the Accused for two months. The Accused was residing sixty Kilometers away from the Petitioner. At that point of time, the Petitioner claimed that the instructions were given to the Accused by him not to use the vehicle for an illegal purpose.",
