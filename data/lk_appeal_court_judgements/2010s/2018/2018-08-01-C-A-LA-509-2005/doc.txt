Decided on 23.07.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, I. A

fter this Court had granted leave to appeal in this matter on 18.03.2009, the appeal

proper stood for argument and rehearing when the 5th Respondent-Petitioner

(who had since become- the Appellant after the grant of leave) passed away on

25.04.2016. His widow has made this application under Section 760A of the Civil

Procedure Code seeking to be substituted as Appellant.

The original action in the District Court of Colombo bearing No.5066/Spl had been

instituted for the purpose of winding-up of the Company known as Magpek Exports Ltd.

The Company was ordered to be liquidated and the 2nd to yh Respondent-Respondents

were appointed as the liqlJidators. It would appear that in regard to the disposal of sales

of assets of the company, the 2nd to 5th RespondeLt-Respondents called for public

tenders and the deceased 5th Respondent-Appellant had submitted a bid for Rs.3 million.

It is apparent that by its order dated 15.10.2004 the District Court of Colombo directed

the 2nd to 5th Respondents to award the tender to the deceased 5th Rtspondent-Petitioner

as his bid was the highest and had been made within the time period.

Subsequently, a joint application dated 01.11.2004 had been filed in the District Court

by both the Creditor-Respondent and the 2nd to 5th Respondents seeking to have the

order dated 15.10.2004 stayed.

It is consequent to this application that on 07.12.2005 the District Court vacated the

order dated 15.10.2004, thus allowing the sale of the subject-matter by way of public

auction as per the agree'ment between the Creditor" Respondent and the 2nd to 5th

Respondents.

It is against the order of the learned District Judge da:ed 07.12.2005 that the deceased

Petitioner had filed this application for leave to appeal in this Court. He was granted

leave.

. , .

As I said before, when th~ appeal was pending before this Court after the leave had been

granted, the 5th Respondent-Appellant (deceased Petitioner) passed away on 25.04.2016

~uring the pendency of the appeal.

The demise of the 5th Respondent-Appellant was brought to the notice of this Court on

05.05.2016 and by a petition and affidavit dated 03.08.2016, the proposed substituted

Petitioner (the widow of the Appellant) made this application moving that she be

, substituted in the room of the deceased Appellant.

I find that the appeal had been argued several times and it was during this period that

the Appellant passed away.

This situation attracts Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code, which reads thus:-

"Where at any time after the lodging of an appeal in any civil action, proceeding or matter, the

record becomes defective by reason of the death or change of status of a party to the appeal, the

Court of Appeal may in the manner provided in the rules made by the Supreme Court for that

purpose, determine who, in the opinion of the court, is the proper person to be substituted or

entered on the record in place of, or in addition to, the party who has died or undergone a change

of status, and the name, of such person shall thereupon be deemed to be substituted or entered of

record as aforesaid. "

In terms of this section, the Court of Appeal has to form an opinion as who is the proper

person to be substituted or entered on the record in place of the party who has passed

away. The section refers to the passing away of a party to the appeal and Section 760 A

of the CPC requires the substitution to be effected in the manner provided in the rules

made by the Supreme C011rt and oftentimes Rule 38 of the Supreme Court is cited as the

appropriate Rule.

"Where at any time after the lodging of an application for special leave to appeal, or an application

under Article 126, or a Hotice of appeal, or the grant of special leave to appeal, or the grant of Ie ave

to appeal by the Court of Appeal, the record becomes defective by reason of the death or change of

status of a party to tht: proceedings, the Supreme Court t~ay one application made in that behalf

5

by any person interested, or ex mere motu, require such applicant or the petitioner or the appellant

as the case may be, to place before Court sufficient material to establish who is the proper person ,

to be substituted or entered on the record in place of or in addition to the party who has died or

undergone a change of status;

Provided that where the party has died or undergone a change of the status is the Petitioner or

Appellant, as the case may be the Court may require such applicant or any party to place such

material before the Court."

It is clear that Rule 38 in this instance refers to a situation where a party has passed away

after the grant of leave to appeal by this Court and since it is the case in this instant

application, the requirement is that sufficient materia] must be placed before this Court

to establish that the person seeking to be substituted is the proper person in place of the

deceased Appellant.

Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code has been interpreted in the past.

In Kusumawathie v. KaIlthi (2004) 1 Sri.LR 350 at 354 the Court of Appeal (Somawansa J with Ekanayake J agreeing) stated that the intent and purpose of section 760 of the

Civil Procedure Code as well as Rule 38 of the Supreme Court Rules is substitution for

the purpose of prosecutirlg the appeal. Though in the original Court the person entitled

to be substituted is the next of kin who has derived the inheritance, there is no such

requirement in the case of an appeal.

The Supreme Court held in GamaraUage Karunawathje v. Godayage Piyasena (2011) 1

SrLLR 171 that Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code can be applied for matters

where the record has become defective upon the death or change of status of a party to

the appeal after the lodgi:lg of the appeal.

In De Silva v. De Croos (2002) 2 SrLLR 409 the COlIn of Appeal observed that if the

substitution is not effected, the judgment becomes an z.bsolute nullity.

In the case ofJayakumb'r v. Gunasekara C.A. LA. -L~o.258/2003, D.C. Colombo No.

2112/Spl (C.A. Minute dc:ted 02.11.2004) the plaintiff died pending appeal and his son,

6

the petitioner, was substituted in place of the original plaintiff in terms of SectiQn 760A

of the Civil Procedure Code and Rule 38 of the S.C. Rules. The Supreme Court, having

set aside the judgment of the District Court and the Court of appeal, entered judgment , in favor of the defendant, that he be restored to possession of the premises.

The Petitioner moved to stay the writ on several grounds, inter alia, that:~

(a) he had acquired undivided rights to the property in suit and those rights have been

acquired independently and not through the deceased Plaintiff;

(b) as a co~owner of the premises in suit he has a right to be in possession.

It was held that when a person is substituted under Se~tion 760A of the Civil Procedure

Code and Rule 38 of the Supreme Court Rules, in plac~ of a deceased party to a pending

appeal, he becomes the l:;~gal representative of such deceased party for the purpose of

such appeal. He, as the legal representative of such party, is entitled to all benefits arising

out of such appeal. Similarly, he has to accept all liabilities, if any, arising from the

judgment in appeal. Until the decree passed in the appeal is satisfied, he continues to be

the deceased party's legal representative.

In jayakodi Arachchilage Rannaide v. jayakodi Arachchilage Priyanbka

Wimalasooriya and Otllers (2012 Galle Law Journal VoU 308 at 312) Ekan<;lyake, J.

1 stated that when there is no 'live appellant', the Court has no jurisdiction to hear and

determine the appeal.

All these cases highlight the necessity to have a substituted Appellant for the purpose of

prosecuting the appeal and it would appear therefore in terms of Section 760A of the

Civil Procedure Code, coupled with the Supreme Court Rule 38, what the Court should

look for is a fit and prOptf person to be substituted for the prosecution of the appeal. If , the person to be substituted appears to the Court to be the fit and proper person (as the

doublet goes in the section), it would be sufficient for the purpose.

The present application for substitution has been made by no less a person than the

widow of the deceased Appellant who left behind the' Petitioner and his two children~

the children having been cited as the 6th and ?th Respondents to the application for

7

substitution. Sufficient material in the form of marriage certificate of the Petitioner and

birth certificates of the 6th and -rh Respondents have been filed with the petition marked

"X2" and "X4" and they go to establish a nexus between the Petitioner and the deceased

Appellant.

The children have not objected to their mother being substituted in the room of their

father. The liquidators too have consented to the substitution being effected.

I take the view that the Petitioner is a fit and proper person in terms of Section 760A of

the Civil Procedure Code to continue the appeal and this Court allows the substitution

of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is directed to file an amended caption reflecting the

substitution within two weeks and the Registrar is directed to notice the parties in

terms of the amended caption and take steps to mention this matter in the appropriate

court to fix the appeal for argument.
