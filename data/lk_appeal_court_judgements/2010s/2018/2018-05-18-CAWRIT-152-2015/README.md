Shiran Gooneratne, J

The Petitioner, the Liquidator of Janatha Fretilizer Enterprises limited

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Liquidator) inter alia, is seeking to quash

the determination of an award dated 25/8/2014, made by the 2nd Respondent

(Assistant Commissioner of Labour) embodied in document marked P21, dated 9/

10/2014.

3

The relevant facts briefly are as follows;

The 5th Respondent (D.K. Wijesundara) complained to the 2nd Respondent

that Janatha Fertilizer Enterprises Limited (herein after sometimes referred to as

JFEL) has defaulted in making contributions as required, under the Employees

Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958. Subsequent to an inquiry, the 2nd Respondent

held that JFEL is liable to pay a sum ofRs. 2,136,415.50 to the 5th Respondent.

JFEL was subjected to a voluntary winding up proceeding and by special

resolution in Gazette Notification dated 25/10/2013, marked X, the Petitioner was

appointed as Liquidator.

By document dated 9110/2014, marked P21, the 2nd Respondent informed

the Liquidator to make the said payment to the 5th Respondent in his capacity as

Liquidator.

The Petitioner objecting to the entorcement of the said determination of

award as contemplated in P21, inter alia, contends that the said award does not

bind the Liquidator and the Liquidator cannot be personally liable to the workman

concerned and therefore the said order has been made in violation of the law and

without legal authority. In support, the Petitioner has cited the case of Latif vs.

Fernando (1978) 79 NLR page 89.

The last paragraph of document marked P21 states,

The Counsel for the Petitioner contends that the inquiry held by the 2nd

Respondent which is embodied in the letter marked P21, was held in an informal

manner and no proceedings were made available to the Petitioner. This Court was

not apprised of the said inquiry proceedings even though, the Respondents

reserved their right to submit the relevant documents to this court at the argument

stage. The Petitioners undertaking to court to produce certified copies of the said

proceedings has also not been met. Therefore, this court cannot look into the

merits or the findings of the said inquiry. However taking into consideration

Document marked P21, the court can make a determination as to the liability of

the Petitioner, Liquidator, in his capacity as Liquidator to make good the award of

the Labour Commissioner.

The State Counsel appeanng for the 1st to 4th and 6th Respondents is

objecting to this application on the basis that the 5th Respondent in his capacity as

a fertilizer commission agent and an area coordinator was an employee of JFEL

and therefore comes within the definition of an employee in terms of the

Employee's Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 (EPF Act) and therefore is

entitled to draw benefits under the said Act.

5

According to the penultimate paragraph of P21, an award has been made

against JFEL to pay a sum of Rs. 2,136,415.50 as default EPF payment to the 5th

Respondent. By document marked P21, the 1 st Respondent has informed the

Petitioner that he is also liable to make the default payment in his capacity as the

Liquidator. In P 12, the 2nd Respondent has clearly communicated to the Petitioner

that in the event JFEL fails to satisfy the award made in terms of the said Act the

Petitioner would be held liable together with others in proceedings to be instituted

in the Magistrate's Court.

The Petitioners concern is that of the liability to the default payment in his

capacity as Liquidator of JFEL and not that of the company, (JFEL) which is

under Liquidation. Therefore, the Judgement of this Court would be limited to the

determination of legality of enforcement of the award by the 2nd Respondent

against the Petitioner Liquidator.

Initiated by the members of JFEL, the said company has adopted a

resolution for a Members Voluntary Winding Up in terms of Section 319 (1) of the

Companies Act No.7 of 2007. In Members Voluntary Winding up, the Liquidator

is appointed by a resolution at a General Meeting and the powers of the Directors

cease upon the appointment of a Liquidator except so far as the company in

general meeting or the Liquidator sanctions the continuance of the powers.

(Section 326(2) of the Companies Act) In every voluntary liquidation, the

Liquidator must apply the property of the company first in paying the preferential

6

debt, (Section 365 of the Companies Act) and then in discharging the liabilities of

the company pari-passu (Section 343 of the Companies Act). Also in terms of

Section 343 of the Companies Act, in every voluntary winding up, it is the dut) of

the Liquidator to pay the debts of the company and adjust the rights of the

contributories among themselves.

In the case of Latif vs. Fernando, 78 NLR 89 at page 90, the Supreme

Court has considered the effect of an award directing the company as well as its

liquidator to deposit certain amounts with the Assistant Commissioner of Labour,

Held,

"That a liquidator of a company which is being wound up cannot be

personally liable for the obligations of the company and no award

under the Industrial Disputes Act could have been made against him

by the Arbitrator. "

It was also held that,

"The liquidator assumes all the ./imctions of the directors, but in the

performance thereof he is charged with certain special statutory

duties of collecting and realizing the Company's assets and

discharging its debts and liabilities. He is given wide powers for the

purpose of winding up the Company's affairs and distributing its

assets. The property of the company does not vest in him,' the

company continues in existence and he administers the affairs of the

company on behalf of the company. Before a resolution to wind up

voluntarily is passed, the management of the company is in the

hands of the officers, the directors; after such a resolution, it is in

the hands of its agent, the liquidator and the Company, acting by its

agent, the liquidator, carries out its obligations towards its

employees. "

7

In the case of East West Research and Design (PVT) LTD. Vs.

Weerakoon, Commissioner of Labour ( 1993) 1 SLR 191 the Court held,

"It has to be borne in mind that the liquidator should not be

considered the alter ego of the errant employer. He is an officer of

Court whose functions are regulated by the provisions of the

Companies Act and the orders made by the winding-up Court from

time to time.

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that a liquidator performs a statutory duty

in collecting the company's assets and discharging its debts and liabilities and in

the execution of such statutory rights would not be liable for any obligations of the

company once liquidation has begun.

Therefore, in all the above circumstances, the relief prayed for in Paragraph

(d), (erroneously stated as paragraph (b) to the prayer) is granted, limited to the

finding, that the Petitioner in his capacity as liquidator, cannot be made personally

liable to the default payment as contemplated and embodied in the last paragraph

8

of the impugned document marked P2 L to an action to be instituted III the

Magistrate's Court pertaining to the industrial dispute in question.

I order no costs.
