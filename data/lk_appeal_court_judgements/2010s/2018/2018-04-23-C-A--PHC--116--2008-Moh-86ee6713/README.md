JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena J

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent

- Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Mannar seeking an order to evict the Appellant

from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2007-

11-05 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

4

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

Northern Province holden in Vaunia seeking a revision of the order of the

learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2008 -10-10, holding that there is no basis

to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate. The

Provincial High Court had then proceeded to dismiss the said revision

application.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant that the

Appellant had relied on the deed bearing No. 246 to establish that the

disputed land is a private land. Further, it was his submission that the said

deed had been attested by the particular Magistrate who had delivered the

impugned order pertaining to this case when he was practicing as a Notary

5

Public. It was his submission that the learned Magistrate was bias due to

this.

The deed above referred to, appears to have effected a transfer of the land

referred to therein. However, it does not set out how and when any title

was devolved upon the said vendor mentioned therein. In that sense, it is

no more than a declaration (rather than a transfer of an existing title).

Whatever the nature it ought to be, one has to bear in mind that such

matters have no relevance for the inquiry before the learned Magistrate

under section 9 of the Act. In any case, it is not a case where the learned

Magistrate either has been a party to this case or has been a party to the

transfer of the land. He is not alleged to have had any other interest in this

case. His only involvement remains as the Notary Public who had attested

this deed (may be amongst many other deeds attested by him) in the

course of his professional duties.

Section 49 (1) of the Judicature Act states as follow;

" .... Except with the consent of both parties thereto, no Judge shall

be competent, and in no case shall any Judge be compellable, to

6

exercise jurisdiction in any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter

in which he is a party or personally interested ... "

In view of the above, this Court is of the view that the learned Provincial

High Court Judge is right when he held that the Appellant had not proved

any bias on the part of the learned Magistrate. After all, the deed in

question is not a document that has relevance to the inquiry held before

the learned Magistrate.

It must be noted that section 9 of the Act sets out the scope of the inquiry

to be held before the Magistrate in following terms;

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid .... "

7

This Court in the case of Muhandiram vs. Chairman, No.11 L Janatha

Estate Development Boardl has re-iterated this position in following terms;

" .. , Unless the respondent-petitioner had established before the learned

Magistrate that he was in occupation of the land stated in the schedule to

the application on a valid permit or other written authority of the State, he

cannot continue to occupy the said land and in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, No.7 of 1979, the Magistrate has to make

an order directing the respondent and his dependents to be ejected from

the land ... ,"

The Supreme Court in the case of L H M B B Herath, Chief Manager

Welfare and Industrial Relations, Sri Lanka Ports Authority V Morgan

Engineering ePvt) Ltd.2 the Supreme Court in the said judgment had held

that section 9 of the Act has placed limitations on the scope of the inquiry

which should be conducted by the Magistrate.

As the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act has been enacted for the

speedy recovery of state lands from unauthorized possession or

occupation, the Supreme Court went on to state in the above judgment as

follows;

1 1992 (1) SLR 110

2 SC Appeal 214/2012 decided on 2013-06-27.

8

" ... if the language of the enactment is clear and unambiguous, it would

not be legitimate for the Courts to add words by implication into the

language. It is a settled law of interpretation that the words are to be

interpreted as they appear in the provision, simple and grammatical

meaning is to be given to them, and nothing can be added or subtracted.

The Courts must construe the words as they find it and cannot go outside

the ambit of the section and speculate as to what the legislature intended.

An interpretation of section 9 which defeats the intent and purpose for

which it was enacted should be avoided .... "

In the instant case, it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced

before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

possession or occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by

section 9 of the Act.

Thus, this Court sees no merits in this appeal.

9

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with

costs costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/= payable to the state by the Petitioner.

Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
