M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The original Plaintiff-Appellant on or around 26.01.1990 instituted an action

bearing Case No. 7428/RE in the District Court of Colombo against the

original Defendant-Respondent (deceased) seeking inter alia to eject the

Defendant-Respondent, his sub tenant and all those persons holding

under him from the premises described in the schedule to the Plaint which

is premises No. 431, Grandpass Road, Colombo 14, to recover arrears of

rental from the period of April, 1984 till 30.09.1989 and further damages at

Rs.25000/- per month from 01.10.1989 till the Plaintiff-Appellant is placed

in possession of the property in suit.

According to the said Plaint, the Plaintiff-Appellant instituted the above

action on three grounds, namely, arrears of rent, subletting and wanton

destruction or unlawful deterioration of premises.

3

The Defendant-Respondent in his answer dated 25.09.1990 (page 62 of

the appeal brief), stated that the said premises was initially given to him by

S. L. M. Hassen and he paid rent to the said S. L. M. Hassen up to

31.12.1985.

At commencement of the trial, the original Plaintiff-Appellant raised 7

issues and Attorney for the Defendant-Respondent objected to issue Nos.

2,3 and 4 but the learned Trial Judge by his order, refused those

objections raised by the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondent (vide page

73-78 of the appeal brief). Thereafter on 18.07.1991 the Substituted

Defendant-Respondent raised 4 issues in support of his contention (vide

page 83 and 84 of the appeal brief).

After trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs action with

costs. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plaintiff-Appellant

preferred this appeal to set aside the judgment and grant relief according

to his Plaint.

In the District Court, the learned District Judge has held that after demise

of the original owner of the premises which described in the schedule to

the Plaint, the Plaintiff-Appellant had become the owner of it. Therefore,

the Plaintiff-Appellant informed the Defendant-Respondent to attorn to him

from 01.07.1986. Thus, the learned District Judge correctly held that the

contract of tenancy (and the attornment) between the Appellant and the

Respondent commenced from that date (01.07.1986). Therefore, the

cause of action based on arrears of rent from April, 1984, could not stand.

Further, the authorized rent for the premises was Rs.67.08 per month,

which was subsequently increased to Rs.192.89. The Defendant-

Respondent had deposited a sum of Rs.2158.21 from July 1986 till

institution of the action with the authorized officer of the Municipal Council,

since the Plaintiff-Appellant refused to accept that sum by way of rent.

4

Furthermore, the Defendant-Respondent had paid rates to the Local

Authority in a sum of Rs.3754/- from the commencement of the contract

with the Plaintiff-Appellant (vide V14 to V32). Accordingly, it is clear that

the Defendant-Respondent was not in arrears at the time the action was

instituted.

Section 21 of the Rent Act, No. 07 of 1972 covers the same instances

where the landlord either refuses or avoids the receipt of the rents from the

tenant with designed purpose of finding a fault on the part of the tenant to

terminate the tenancy agreement.

Section 21 reads as follows:

1. The tenant of any premises may pay the rent of the

premises to the authorized person instead of the landlord.

2. Where any payment of any rent of any premises is made

on any day in accordance with the provisions of

subsection (1), it shall be deemed to be a payment

received on that day by the landlord of the premises from

the tenant thereof.

3. Where the rent of any premises is paid to the authorized

person, the authorized person shall issue to the tenant of

the premises a receipt in acknowledgment of such

payment, and shall transmit the amount of such payment

to the landlord of the premises. It shall be the duty of such

landlord to issue to the authorized person a receipt in

acknowledgment of the amount so transmitted to him.

5

4. In this section, " authorized person ", with reference to any

premises, means the Mayor, or Chairman of the local

authority within whose administrative limits the premises

are situated or the person authorized in writing by such

Mayor or Chairman to receive rents paid under this

section, or where the Minister so determines, the board of

the area within which the premises are situated.

(Vide: SAMARAWEERA vs. RANASINGHE, 59 NLR 395, DE SILVA vs.

ABEYRATNE, 56 NLR 574, SUBRAMANIAM vs.

PATHMANATHAN (1984) 2 SLR 252 and VIOLET PERERA vs. ASILIN

NONA (1996) 1 SLR 1)

Therefore, I am of the view that there is no error in the finding of the

learned District Judge on the first cause of action.

Further, the learned District Judge has, on the evidence placed before him,

concluded that one Sugath, to whom it was alleged that the Defendant-

Respondent sublet the premises, was only a Manager of the business run

by the Defendant-Respondent and he was paid a salary of Rs.1000/- per

month. In any event, the evidence led before the learned District Judge by

the Plaintiff-Appellant by his evidence failed to establish the two main

ingredients necessary to prove sub-letting, namely, exclusive possession

and the payment of rent by the sub-tenant and to the tenant. On that basis,

it is my view that the learned District Judge had correctly dismissed the

Plaintiff-Appellants second cause of action.

With regard to the third cause of action of deterioration of premises, apart

from the Plaintiff-Appellants evidence certain photographs have been

produced in support (marked as P9 to P14). However, the Defendant-

6

Respondent in his evidence stated that the premises was in such a state

dis-repair, he had requested the Plaintiff-Appellant to attend to the same;

and since the Plaintiff-Appellant failed to do so, he had with approval of the

Urban Development Authority (U.D.A) attended to necessary repairs

without any structural alteration. If there were structural alterations the

Local authorities should not have permitted the repairs to be attended to.

Further, if there were structural alterations, the Plaintiff-Appellant could

have pursued the matter with the U.D.A. Therefore, I am of the view that,

the learned District Judge had handled the case in a careful manner and

found that the Defendant-Respondent has in fact improved the premises

and caused no deterioration or destruction thereof and dismissed the claim

of the Plaintiff-Appellant on the third cause of action.

In the circumstances enumerated above, I see no reason to interfere with

the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 03.12.1991.

Therefore, I dismiss the appeal without Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
