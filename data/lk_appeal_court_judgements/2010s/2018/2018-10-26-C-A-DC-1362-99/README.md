The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant') instituted the

above styled action against the Defendant-Respondent above named now

deceased (hereinafter referred to as the 'Respondent') by his amended Plaint

dated 2ih February 1985, prayed inter alia for a declaration of title to Lot 2 of the

land called "Wanchawala Addara Kumbura" depicted in Survey Plan No. 618

dated 28th July 1984, made by Gamini Samarasinghe, Licensed Surveyor.

In the amended Plaint, the Appellant stated that the title to the land he claimed

commenced in the year 1901 by one Don Bronis De Silva Amarasinghe and as

per his pedigree recited in the amended Plaint became the owner to the land

under and by virtue of Deed of Transfer No. 2380 dated 22th July 1961. It was

averred by the Appellant that his predecessors in title have possessed the land

for the past 50 years.

It was also arrived by the Appellant that the Respondent who is the reputed

owner to the land known as "Wanchawala Watta" which forms the Western

boundary of the Appellant's field, on or about ih March 1982 had encroached

3

portion of his land from the Western boundary which portion is depicted as Lot 2

of the Plan No. 618.

The Respondent by his answer dated 2ih September 1989, whilst denying the

averments contained in the Plaint and stated inter alia that:

a) The land depicted as Lot 2 in Survey Plan No. 618, forms a part of his

land which is known as "Wanchawala Watta";

b) In any event, he has prescribed and obtained to the said Lot 2 in the Plan

No. 618 is the Lot B in Plan No. 1148 dated 28th February 1989 made by

G. H. A. A. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor.

Therefore, the Respondent prayed for a dismissal of the Appellant's action with

Costs.

The Respondent further averred that he and his predecessors in title have

possessed the lots A and B in Plan No. 1148 for more than 10 years prior to the

date of the action and had prescribed to the land.

The District Court trial commenced on 13th September 1991 on eight issues

raised on behalf of the Appellant and seven issues raised on behalf of the

Respondent.

The Appellant himself, Licensed Surveyor Samarasinghe who prepared the said

Plan No. 618 and the Grama Niladhari of the area gave evidence on behalf of the

Appellant and documents marked 'P1' to 'P8' were tendered on behalf of the

appellant, whilst the Respondent and Surveyor De Silva who prepared Survey

Plan No. 1148 on a Commission issued on application of the Respondent, gave

evidence and documents marked 'V1' to 'V4' were tendered on behalf of the

Respondent.

The Learned Additional District Judge of Galle delivered judgment on 6th

December 1999, dismissing the action of the Appellant with Costs.

4

Being aggrieved with the said judgment dated 6th December 1999, this appeal

preferred by the Appellant seeking to set aside the District Court judgment.

In the District Court trial, it was the evidence of the Appellant that prior to ih

March 1982 Lots 1 and 2 in Plan No. 618 were the paddy lands of the Appellant

and on ih March 1982 the Respondent filled the Western boundary of the paddy

land with sand and stones up to 20 feet length and that he complained to the

Grama Niladhari and the Commissioner General of the Agrarian Services.

Appellant also gave evidence and stated that prior to 1982 there had been some

minor incidents. Also it was the contention of the Appellant that although there

had been minor incidents, on or about ih March 1982 the Respondent built the

stony wall in his paddy land encroaching a portion.

However, I observed that, in the cross examination the Appellant has admitted

that the land of the Appellant is low land and Respondent's land is about 5 feet

above the paddy field. It is also admitted that he himself showed the boundaries

to the Surveyor Samarasinghe and they were shown in black (vide pages 107,

111 and 113 in the appeal brief- District Court Proceedings dated 16th July 1992).

Further, the Appellant has admitted that the land possessed by him was not in

conformity with the superimposed Plan (vide page 114 in the appeal brief).

Furthermore, Counsel for the Respondent has brought an important point to the

attention of this court that when the Appellant was questioned regarding the

possession of the land, Appellant was unaware of the land marks and

construction standing on the questioned area (Western boundary) - vide pages

96, 116 in the appeal brief

In contrast, the Respondent gave evidence to prove his title to Lots 14 and 15.

For this, he produced deeds marked V2, V3 and V4. And he stated that he

possessed Lot B along with Lot A during his father was alive and he further

stated that the well standing on in Lot 2 in plan No. 618 was used by his family

from old days. He also answered when cross examined that the stony bund had

been there when his father was alive and when he was questioned that in 1975

5

he removed the stony bund built by his father and re built it again by cement.

Also he stated that he never encroached and possessed Appellant's land but he

only possessed the land as per his partitioned Plan. Thus the Respondent

submitted that he was in undisturbed possession of the questioned land more

than 10 years prior to the institution of the present action.

Here, the Respondent must prove his averment with section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, Act No. 02 of 1889. According to said section the following

requirements are necessary:

1. Undisturbed an uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant and

3. Ten (10) years previous to the bringing of such action.

Therefore, in order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a change

in the nature of the possession and the party claiming prescriptive right should

show an ouster.

In Sirajudeen and Two others VS. Abbas (1994) 2 SLR 365, G. P. S. De Silva,

C. J. held that.

"As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general

statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for

a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of

the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title by

prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to

specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided

thereupon by Court."

"One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided

for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a

title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The

occupation of the premises must be of such character as is incompatible

with the title of the owner. "

6

In Chelliah vs. Wijenathan 54 NLR 337, at page 342, Gratiaen, J. held that:

"Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and squarely on him

to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

If that onus has prima facie been discharged, the burden shifts to the

opposite party to establish that, by reason of some disability recognized by

Section 13, prescription did not in fact run from the date on which the

adverse possession first commenced. Once that has been established,

the onus shifts once again to the other side to show that the disability had

ceased on some subsequent date and that the adverse possession relied

on had uninterruptedly continued thereafter for a period of ten years. "

In De Silva vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, 80 NLR 292,

Sharvananda, J. clearly and deeply observed that:

"The principle of law is well established that a person who bases his title in

adverse possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that

his possession was hostile to the real owner and amounted to a denial of

his title to the property claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession,

the possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The acts of

the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the rights of the

true owner; the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as

against the true owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial of the title of

the true owner there can be no adverse possession ... " (Pages 295 and

296)

Applying these principles to the present case, I take the view that the

Respondent has proved the specific facts regarding his possession; and

enjoyment of the property for ten years before the action was instituted.

,

7

In the above mentioned legit reasons, I am of the obvious view that the learned

District Judge had carefully analyzed the entire facts and evidence placed before

him.

Therefore, I affirm the District Court Judgment dated 6th December 1999; and

dismiss this appeal with cost.

Appeal dismissed.
