ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

was served with a quit notice, issued under Section 3 of the Local

Authority Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978 as

amended, by the 2nd Respondent-Respondent on behalf of the 1st

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondents") on 05.04.2011.

It is stated that the Appellant was employed by the 1st Respondent

as a meter reader since February 1976. He was provided with official

quarters, which he occupied until he was served with the said quit notice.

The official quarters was made available to the Appellant by the

Respondents, under an agreement of rent with the condition that it is only

a temporary arrangement and he is to handover its possession on short

notice. Parties have entered into the said agreement on 15.09.1976.

Thereafter, in November 1984 the parties entered into another

agreement of rent which included a clause that it is subject to the

provisions of Local Authority Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No.

42 of 1978.

2

When the quit notice was issued on the Appellant, he sought a Writ

of Certiorari from the Provincial High Court holden in Anuradhapura to

quash the said notice. The Provincial High Court, by its order dated

29.02.2012, refused the Appellant's application and he seeks to invoke

appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set it aside.

The Appellant, in seeking to quash the quit notice, sought a Writ of

Certiorari on the basis that he is not an employee of the 1st Respondent

since 01.11.1984 and therefore the 2nd Respondent could only claim

possession through a civil action instituted under the Rent Act.

In refusing relief to the Appellant, the Provincial High Court

considered primarily that he is not entj tIed for a Writ of Certiorari as he

claims relief under a contract. The Provincial High Court opted to follow

the reasoning of the judgments of Perera v NHDA (2001) 3 Sri L.R. 50, Podi

Nona v Municipal Council, Horana (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 141 and Jayaratne v

Wijesekere(1985) 2 Sri L.R. 413.

The Appellant, in support of his appeal submitted to this Court that

the quit notice was issued unlawfully as the parties are bound by the terms

of the agreement and therefore the Provincial High Court should have

issued the Writ.

In view of this submission, it is necessary to consider the said

agreement of tenancy and the applicable provisions of the Local Authority

Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law.

As already noted the clause 6 of the agreement of rent dated

10.10.1986, has reserved the Respondents' right to recover possession of

3

the quarters which the Appellant occupies, under the provisions of Local

Authority Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law.

Section 2 of the said Law states that;

"The provisions of this Law-

(a) Shall apply to all local authority quarters;

and

(b) Shall be deemed at all times to have

been, and to be, an implied condition of

the occupation by persons of such

quarters."

In relation to the Appellant, In addition to the said deeming

provision, there is specific clause in the agreement that in recovery of the

quarters, the provisions of the said Law will be resorted to. This particular

Section made all persons in occupation of such quarters under the purview

of the said Law.

A similar situation arose before the apex Court in Balasunderam v

The Chairman, JEDB and Others (1997) 1 Sri L.R. 83 for consideration. The

appellant before the Supreme Court was issued with a quit notice under

Section 3 of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7

of 1979.

It was held that;

"the power to serve quit notice is not limited to a case

where the person in occupation is an employee of the

4

estate. Quarters provided "to any person" by a public

corporation can be recovered under the act."

The Supreme Court also held that a "person who had been provided

quarters prior to the date of the Act would also be subject to be ejected under the

Act". This reasoning was followed by this Court in Thamel v Road

Development Authority and Others (2005) 2 Sri L.R. 175.

Considering the wording used in Section 2 of the Local Authority

Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978 as emended, it is

clear that the Respondent could serve a quit notice on the Appellant as the

occupier of the quarters. Clause 6 of the agreement of rent also referred to

the provisions of the said Law for the recovery of possession.

Therefore, the Appellant brought himself under the purview of the

said Law and is therefore subject to its provisions. Since there is no

challenge as to the 2nd Respondent's decision to issue quit notice on the

Appellant, this Court holds that the Appellant is not entitled with the relief

he sought from the Provincial High Court upon the very agreement he

relied on to challenge the quit notice.

In relation to the order of the Provincial High Court, it must be

observed that it proceeded to dismiss the Appellant's application also on

the basis that the Respondents have not acted in ultra vires. In addition, it

proceeded to hold that the availability of alternative efficacious remedy

under breach of contract and as the Appellant claimed that the parties are

bound by the terms of a wri Hen contract, he is not entitled to a

discretionary remedy by way of a prerogative Writ.

5

, ..

We see no reason to interfere with the order of the Provincial High

Court and therefore hold that there is absolutely no merit in the appeal of

the A ppellan t.

Accordingly, the Appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs. 25,000.00
