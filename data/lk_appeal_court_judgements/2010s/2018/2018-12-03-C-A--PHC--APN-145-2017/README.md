K. K. WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The petitioner-petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 31.05.2017 in Bail

Application No: HCAB 31/2017.

Facts of the case:

The petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter ref~lTed to as the 'petitioner') and three others

were arrested on or about 09.09.2015 ,)y the officers of Narcotic Bureau at the

Bandaranayake International Airport for possession of heroin. Thereafter all the

suspects were produced before the Learr.ed Magistrate ofNegombo under case No.

BI1 711 120 15 and the Learned Magistrate made an order to detain them until

15.09.2015.

On 15.09.2015, the petitioner and the 2nd suspect were remanded further and the

other two suspects were released. A bail application was filed on behalf of the

petitioner on 15.06.2016, in the High C:Jurt of Negombo in terms of section 83 of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act no 13 of

1984 and it was refused on 27.10.2016.

Thereafter another bail application W 1S filed on behalf of the petitioner on

20.01.2017 in the High Court ofNegomc,o. The Learned High Court Judge refused

to enlarge the petitioner on bail by the order dated 31.05.2017 due to the absence

of exceptional circumstances.

Page 3 of 12

Being aggrieved by the said refusal, the petitioner preferred a revision application

to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner'mbmitted that the petitioner was engaged

in a business of importing garments frOl'n India. The 2nd suspect had given Rs.20,

000/= to the petitioner and requested her to purchase four Black Label bottles.

Thereafter the 2nd suspect had requested the petitioner to give the remaining money

to one Mohammed Iyal at the Airport of Chennai. Accordingly she had done the

same. After taking the money, the said rvlohammed Iyal had asked the petitioner to

go and have a cup of tea and return while he was taking care of her baggage.

Thereafter the petitioner had left India with her bags. The Learned Counsel further

submitted that the petitioner had no knowledge that she was carrying a prohibited

drug inside her bag. She had thought that there were few bottles of liquor.

Accordingly the Learned Counsel has submitted following two cases;

i 1. The case of Van Der Hultes V. Attorney General (1989) 1 Sri. LR 204, in t

which it was held that,

"Mens rea is an essential ingredient of the offences of possessing and

attempting to export heroin under sections 54A and 54B of Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance amended by Act No. 13 of 1984. "

2. The case of King V. Haramanis .18 NLR 403, in which it was held that,

"As a matter of law the prosecution is neither bound to assign nor

prove a motive as to why a criminal act was done ... But when the facts

themselves are not clear,- and there is also the absence of an

intelligible motive, theses combined factors may have the effect of

creating doubts in favour of the accused"

Page IJ of 12

However we are not inclined to conside' tile m~rits of a case, which is pending in a

I lower court, for the purpose of grantin! J bail. Therefore we are unable to consider

the mens rea of an accused or facts ofJ--e case as exceptional circumstances. These , matters should be considered at the trial in the High Court.

! The Learned Counsel for the petitioner,' has further submitted that the petitioner is

60 years of age and has no previous con1victions or any pending cases. The Learned

Counsel has submitted the case of Peter Singho V. Werapitiya [55 NLR 155] in

which the Court has observed as follow~,;

"The accused had advisedly taken the risk of putting his "good

character" in issue. It was, therefore, open to the prosecution, if they could,

to prove his "bad character" un i2r section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Instead of doing so they suggested to him in cross-examination (and he was

forced to admit) that there was J'ending against him at the time a criminal

case in which he was charged with forgery. "The mere fact that a man has

been charged with an offence is no proof that he committed the offence.

Such a fact is irrelevant; it goes neither to show that the prisoner did the

acts for which he is actually being tried nor does it go to his credibility as a

witness". Maxwell v. D.P.P (1). "

However we observe that the case of P(~ter singho had dealt with the admissibility

of a question that was asked from an accused in cross-examination with regard to

pending criminal cases against him. \Ve find no relevance between the said

decision and the instant revision applica ::,"'n.

We observe that the petitioner was alT.!sted by the narcotic officers with a gross

quantity of 190 grams of heroin and ac(:ording to the Government Analyst'S report

the pure amount of heroin was 101.81gnms. (Page 59 and 60 of the brief)

Pag(~ 5 of 12

In the case of Ranil Charuka Kulathul1ga V. AG rCA (PHC) APN 134/2015], it

was held that,

"The quantity of cocaine involnd in this case is 62.847 grams, which is a

I commercial quantity. If Petition<r is convicted, the punishment is death or

life imp~isonment. Under these ~lii'cumstances, it is prudent to conclude the

trial early while the Petitioner is'cept in custody ... "

The Learned SSC for the respondent contended that it is in fact the trial judge who

has the best opportunity to correctly appreciate the impact of enlarging the

petitioner on bail during the trial. We are of the view that the Learned High Court

Judge has a better opportunity to assess the mindset of the accused and the Learned

Judge can consider the time period of the trial to grant bail accordingly.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted several cases including the

cases of Milroy Fernando V. Attorney General (CA Bail 542/90-H.C. Chilaw

AB 2/89) and O.I.C, Police Narcotics' Bureau V. Kanahala Gamage Suneetha

(C A Rev. 3 12002, H .C. Colombo - BA 454/02).

However in the case of Cader (on oehalf of Rashid Kahan) V. Officer in

Charge, Narcotics Bureau (2006) 3 SLR 12, Justice Eric Basnayake, observed as

follows;

"The exceptional circumstances 1ave not been defined in the statute. I shall

mention here some cases where bail has been granted. In Milroy Fernando

vs. Attorney General(lJ the aCL~used was taken in to custody with three

others for possession of 14 kiev grams of heroin. The following facts

transpired in this case, namely: ' * Heroin was found among the bales of textiles stored in a boat. * The suspect was merely a workman in the boat.

Page 6 of 12

* The suspect had been in remand for a period of 16 months. * The Government Analyst's report is not as yet available. * Therefore the indictment cannot be ready in the near future.

The suspect was released on Rs . . J 00,000/- cash bail with several other

conditions. In o.I.e, Police Narcotics Bureau vs. Kanahala Gamage

.:-Sun eeth am (2) the suspect was released on bail in a sum of Rs.1 00, 000/- in

addition to other conditions. The faNs are as follows:-

I * The suspect was arrested w:'th 134.1 grams of heroin

~ . * The suspect was in remand/or a period of over one year. * Indictment had already been sent. * There were neither previou," convictions nor pending cases. * The husband of the suspect /00 had been in remand. * The six year old child was left behind unattended.

The court considered as a special circumstance the fact that both parents

had been in remand and their child was left unattended.

... In the six cases mentioned above, it was only in one case the court

considered the facts constituting exceptional circumstances in granting bail.

In all the other cases the court refrained from referring to a specific

ground as constituting exceptionalj circumstances. Therefore, the question , . is, should the facts of those cases be considered as constituting exceptional

circumstances? In Milroy Fernando's case the court allowed bail after

considering the extent to which the suspect had been involving in the

commission of the crime. Could we consider the period in remand as a

ground constituting an exceptional circumstance? Provision has been made

in the Bail Act to release persons on bail if the period of remand extends

more than 12 months. No such provision is found in the case of Poison,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Although bail was granted in

Page 70f 12

some of the cases mentioned abo~'e. None of these cases refer to the time

period in remand as constituting an exceptional circumstance. Hence bail

\1 cannot be considered on that grou'nd alone. It appears from the cases cited

above that there is no guiding principle with regard to the quantity found

either. The fact of dispatching the indictment too cannot be considered

either for or against the granting of bail. In one of the cases mentioned

above, the fact of not sending th? indictment was considered in favor of

granting bail while in another j case, sending the indictment was not

considered to refuse bail ... " (Emphasis added)

We agree with the above reasoning of J(istice E. Basnayake since Court is vested

with a wider discretion to decide what constitutes exceptional circumstances.

Accordingly we are of the view that similar facts of another case do not constitute

exceptional circumstances for the instant application unless Court has laid down a

certain rule to grant bail in the particular judgment.

In the case ofW.R.Wickramasinghe V. !he Attorney General [CA (PH C) APN

"\ 3912009], it was held that,

"When Section 3 of the Bail Act :s considered it is seen that the Bail Act

shall not apply to a person accused or suspected of having committed or

convicted of an offence under

1. The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No 48 of

1979,

2. Regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance, or

3. Any other written law which makes express provision in respect of

the release on bail of pe/'sons accused or suspected of having

committed, or convicted of, offences under such other written law.

Page f of 12

It is therefore seen that when the legislature enacted the Bail Act it

was not the intention of the legislature to release each and every

suspect who has been on remandfor a period exceeding 24 months. "

}

In the case of Shiyam V. Attorney Ge;;neral (2006) 2 Sri L.R 156, it was held

that,

\

" ... Therefore, even if I am to agree with the submissions of the learned

I President's Counsel for the appellants, yet the provisions of section 83(1) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act would be applicable and the

proper forum for making an appli( ation for bail when a person is suspected

or accused of an offence under SE;'ction 54A or 54B of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Act would be the High Court where such bail would

be granted only in exceptional circumstances. The criteria therefore set out

by section 3(1) of the Bail Act fm exclusions are clearly dealt with by the

provisions contained in section 83;'1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous \ Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 qr 1984 ... 1 hold that the provisions in the

Bail Act would have no application to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act ... "

In the case of Labukola Ange Wisin Gedara Ashani Dhanushshika V. Attorney

General lCA (PHC) APN 4/2016], it was held that,

"In the present case the petitlOner failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances warranting this co!'{ ~t to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

The petitioner's first point is that the suspect is in remand nearly for two

years. The intention of the legislaz'ire is to keep in remand any person who

is suspected or accused of pos~<;essing or trafficking heroin until the

Page '1 of 12

conclusion of the case. The sectiol'l 83(1) of the Act expresses the intention of

the legislature '" "

Accordingly we are of the view that the.1remand period of the petitioner cannot be

considered as an exceptional circumstance.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the 2nd suspect was

released on bail after six months.

However it is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge in the order

dated 31.05.2017 has held as follows;

" ... ~ ~12S)2S)~ ctI~ l5) ~C;J wIB @ e.5I2S)2S)J5~C) q'C;JC ~5@ccl'Q 2S)~~zsf

According to the B reports of 171112015 the petitioner had a bag containing three

liquor bottles and two Cadbury chocolates. The officers had recovered heroin

inside the aluminum cover of those chccolates. The second suspect was arrested

subsequently as he had come to collect the aforesaid bag of liquor bottles. It was

revealed that the 3rd suspect was not involved in the offence but driving the vehicle

that was hired by the 2nd suspect. The 4.th suspect was a friend of the said 2nd

suspect. Therefore we agree with the a Jove finding of the Learned High Court

Judge since the petitioner was the key c ffender of the instant case and the heroin

was allegedly recovered from her possession.

In the case of Soysa V. Silva and Others (2000) 2 Sri L.R. 235, it was held that,

"This power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from Ih.e Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal. Its object is the due admiJ'istration of Justice and the correction of

error, sometimes committed by, the Court itself, in order to avoid

miscarriage of Justice (Merino ~.F. vs Seyed Mohamed(l)). The power

given to a Superior Court by way. of revision is wide enough to give it the

right to revise any order made by an original Court, whether an appeal has

been taken against it or not. This right will be exercised in which an appeal

is pending only in exceptional circumstances as, for example, to ensure that

the decision given on appeal is not rendered nugatory ... "

In the case ofRamu Thamotharampillai V. Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri. L.R

180, it was held that,

"The decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances. But in order that Uke cases may be decided alike and that

there will be ensured some uniformity of decisions it is necessary that some

guidance should be laid down for tlie exercise of that discretion ... "

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisiona.y jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irrEgularity that an ordinary person would

Page 1 ~_ of 12

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Accordingly we see no miscarriage of ju~tice, illegality or error in the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 31.05.2017. Therefore we see no

reason to interfere with the same.

The revision application is hereby dismis~ed without costs.
