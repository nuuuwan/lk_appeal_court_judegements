Judgment on 25/05/2018

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking a

mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision communicated

to the 2nd Petitioner by the Respondent, by letter dated 16/07/2014, marked P5,

that the Department of Buddhist Affairs does not recognize a Nikaya/ Chapter by

the name "Amarapura Siri Saddammawansa Dheerananda Sanga Sabawa",

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Sanga Sabawa") and the rejection of

registration of declarations made by 3rd to 19th Petitioners in terms of Section 4, of

the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 (as amended), (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Act") submitted in terms of Section 41, of the Act.

The Petitioners have also sought a mandate in the nature of writ of Mandamus to

direct the Respondent to take appropriate steps to register the said declarations in

terms of the said Act.

When this case was taken up for argument, both parties agreed that the case

could be disposed of by written submissions and accordingly, the Petitioners and

the Respondent's written submissions are filed of record.

The Petitioners state that, there are around 88 temples and about 243

bhikkhus belonging to the said Sanga Sabawa and further state that due to

divisions among the bhikkhu community a number of Nikayas or Chapters came

5

into existence other than the three main Nikayas in Sri Lanka, namely, Shyamopali

Maha Nikaya, Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa and Ramangya Maha Nikaya. The

Petitioners submit that under the said Act, there is no requirement for the said

Sanga Sabawa to be affiliated to either of the three main Nikayas in Sri Lanka, to

have their declarations registered under the said Act. However, by letter dated

09110/2013, marked R3, Rev. Belideniye Sridhamma and Rev. Rajawatte Wappa

made an application to the Respondent requesting approval for registration of the

said Sanga Sabawa as a new chapter under the Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa.

The Respondent inter alia, submits that in terms of the constitution of the Sri

Lanka Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa marked Rl and R2, it is conventionally

and customarily accepted that the appointment of a Maha Nayake Thero of a new

sub chapter affiliated to the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa has to be

accepted or recognized by the said Maha Sanga Sabawa.

Section 41(2) (a) of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (as amended) states;

(aJ in respect of every person who becomes a bhikkhu after the commencement

of this Ordinance.

(i) if he becomes an upasampada bhikkhu he shall procure from the

Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs copies of from A in the Schedule

and enter therein the details regarding himself for which space is

there provided; and

6

(iO if he becomes a samanera the robing tutor shall procure copies of

from B in the Schedule and enter therein the details regarding such

samanera for which space is there provided.

(b) ................ .

From B contains, cages 1-15 to be filed, inter alia, giving the name of the

Nikaya and the name of Mahanayake Thero.

The Respondent by letter date 07/1112013, marked R4, has sought advice

on this issue from the Mahanayake Thero of the Amarapura Sanga Sabawa, which

has been copied to the said bhikkhus.

For reasons stated in letter dated 1211112013, marked R5, the Mahanayake

Thero of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya has not approved the new chapter created in

the name of the Amarapura Nikaya. The Respondent thereafter has communicated

the said decision to the 15t Petitioner by the impugned letter dated 16/07/2014,

marked P5.

The Respondent by letter dated 0711112013, marked R4, has informed the

Petitioners concerns to the Mahanayake Thero of the Amarapura Sanga Sabawa

and sought counsel regarding the application to register a new chapter in the name

of the said Sanga Sabawa. Thereafter, by letter dated 1211112013, marked R5, the

Mahanayake Thero of the Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa, for reasons stated,

informed the Petitioner, that it would not be appropriate to grant the registration

sought by the said Sanga Sabawa. Accordingly, the Respondent has communicated

7

the said decision by the impugned letter marked P5, to the Petitioners. It is

observed that the decision not to grant the Sanga Sabawa of the required

registration as a chapterl Nikaya was made in consideration of the observations

submitted by the Mahanayake Thero of the Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa.

In the circumstances, the question arises, as a party affected by the outcome

of this writ application, shouldn't the Maha Nayake Thero of the Amarapura

Nikaya made a Respondent to the Petition. The Respondent in his statement of

objections has made reference to the Petitioners of directly violating the rights of

the Sri Lanka Amarapura Sanga Sabawa, and the Petitioners failure to produce

vital material documents to establish their claim for registration in terms of clause

5.00 of the Amended Constitution produced marked, R2.

In the case of Wijeratne Vs. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero and

others, (2011) 2 SLR 258, the Supreme Court considered the effect of necessary

parties to an application, where the court held, that;

"those who would be affected by the outcome o/the writ application should

be made respondents to the application"

As noted earlier, the said Sanga Sabawa, by letter dated 09110/2013,

marked R3, has made an application to be registered as a new chapter which is

formed within and submits to the authority of the Amarapura Maha Sanga

Sabawa. For reasons stated In letter dated 1211112013, marked R5, the said

declarations have been rejected to be registered by the said Amarapura Maha

.. 8

Sanga Sabawa, a party which is not before court. In the circumstances, the

Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabawa is a necessary party and should be made a

Respondent to this Petition, failure to do so, is fatal to the validity of this Petition.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
