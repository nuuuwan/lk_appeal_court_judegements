ARGUED AND DECIDED ON

K.G. Jinasena with D.K.V. Jayanath for the Petitioner

P. PADMAN SURASENA J (PICA)

Learned Counsel for the petitioner was heard in support

of his application. The grievance placed before this Court by the

learned Counsel for the petitioner is the fact that the petitioner was

not made aware as to how the marks had been given at the interview

held for the selection of candidates for the relevant promotion. This

Court observes that in the petition itself [paragraph 23(V)] the

petitioner has admitted that the 38.6 marks has been awarded to

her. This means that the petitioner has been made aware of her

marks.

This Court also observes that the University Service

Appeal Board also has considered the appeal lodged by the petitioner

and in the penultimate paragraph of the lengthy decision setting out

reasons, the said Appeal Board has explained the marking scheme

that has been adopted at the interview. The said decision is

;)

contained in a document that the petitioner has filed in this Court.

This means that the petitioner is aware of the overall marking

scheme as well.

It appears from the perusal of the decision of the Appeal

Board that the said Appeal Board has reasoned out the basis as to

how the petitioner had got lesser marks than those who had been

selected. In these circumstances, we see no basis for this Court to

issue notices on the respondents. Therefore, we refuse to issue

notices. The application is dismissed without costs.
