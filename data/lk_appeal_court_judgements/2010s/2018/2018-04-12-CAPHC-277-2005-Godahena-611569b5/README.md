JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) has made an application to the

Magistrate's Court of Balapitiya seeking a mandatory order from

the learned Magistrate under section 28 A (3) of the Urban

Development Law (hereinafter sometimes referred to as UDA

Law), to demolish an unauthorized construction. This was

pursuant to the Respondent-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellant) defaulting the compliance

with a notice issued under section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law.

Learned Magistrate thereafter had afforded the Appellant an

opportunity to submit any objection he may have regarding the

! ! !

5

said application. The Appellant pursuant to that had filed his

objections along with an affidavit and several documents.

Learned Magistrate having considered the material before him

had pronounced his order dated 2002-05-13, granting power to

the Respondent, under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law, to

demolish the said construction.

The Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden at

Balapitiya, upon an appeal filed by the Appellant has also

considered this case. The Provincial High Court after hearing

parties had pronounced its judgment dated 2006-07-31. It had

affirmed the learned Magistrate's order and dismissed the said

appeal.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal

in this Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellant in the course of the argument

which was concluded on 2017-06-14, confined only to one

({ fIItIIIIt i If!

6

argument. That was the argument that the Respondent has failed

to carry out his delegated power according to the terms of the

delegation. He relied on the document dated 1991-12-31 that had

been produced marked <3'~ 1.

Referring to the last two lines of that letter, learned counsel for

the Appellant submitted that the UDA has delegated its powers to

the Respondent subject to the condition that the Respondent

must act according to the direction control and supervision of the

UDA. Thus, it was his submission that the Respondent (Balapitiya

Pradeshiya Sabha) had not carried out this delegated power

under the direction control and supervision of the UDA.

It must be mentioned here that the argument of this case was

concluded before this Court as a normal appeal on 2017-06-14.

Indeed this Court reserved its judgement consequent to the

conclusion of the said argument on the merits of this case for a

later date (i.e. 2017-08-10). The parties undertook to file written

7

submissions on the merits of the case, which they had done

subsequently.

It is significant that neither of the parties had thought it

necessary to place before this Court the very important fact,

which directly shows that neither the Provincial High Court nor

the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to entertain this case.

This Court has perused the petition of appeal filed by the

Appellant in the Provincial High Court. It is clear that it is an

Appellate jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court that had been

invoked by the Appellant. Learned counsel for the Appellant in his

second set of written submissions! has conceded that the

Appellant indeed has no right of appeal to do what he did before

the Provincial High Court.

Thus, it is clear beyond doubt that the Provincial High Court had

exercised a nonexistent appellate jurisdiction in respect of the

1 After this Court raised the issue of jurisdiction with the learned counsel for both parties.

order of the learned Magistrate. Unfortunately, this matter had

not been brought to the notice of the learned Provincial High

Court Judge by either party.

Since the Provincial High Court had dismissed the appeal, the

appellant has filed an appeal against the said judgement to this

Court. The intention of the Appellant has been clearly to get the

judgement of the Provincial High Court overturned in his favour.

This is despite the fact that the Appellant had wrongfully

persuaded the Provincial High Court to exercise a nonexistent

appellate jurisdiction.

The Appellant had not stopped at that. He had attempted to do

the same thing before this Court also. It is settled law that

anyone. aggrieved by any order or judgement of the Provincial

High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, must file its

appeal before the Supreme Court. This Court does not have such

appellate jurisdiction in respect of such an order. It is unfortunate

t

~ tfI

that the Appellant had used all his resources to get this Court also

to exercise a non-existent appellate jurisdiction.

Pursuant to this Court reserving its judgement after the parties

concluded their submissions on the merits of the case2 this Court

commenced preparing its judgement. It is only in that process

that this Court found out that both the Provincial High Court and

this Court do not have appellate jurisdiction to entertain the said

appeals.

It is a fact that neither party had placed this matter before this

Court either in their oral submissions or in the written

submissions filed subsequent to the original argument. 3

When the above question of want of jurisdiction crossed the mind

. of this Court, it decided to withhold its judgement and seek

clarifications from the counsel for both parties. Then this Court

fixed this case for that purpose for a subsequent date and placed

this matter before the learned counsel for both parties.

~earned counsel for the Appellant had then filed his written

submissions on that point. He seeks to argue that what the

Provincial High Court had in fact exercised is its revisionary

jurisdiction and not the appellant jurisdiction. There is no

explanation forthcoming from the Appellant as to why that

argument was not placed before this Court at the first instance.

On the other hand, from what appears from, the petition of

appeal filed in the Provincial High Court, the record of the

subsequent proceedings that followed from that time onwards

and the judgement delivered by the Provincial High Court, it is

amply clear that it is not the revisionary jurisdiction that the

Provinciai High Court had exercised. The above material show

dearly that it is the appellate jurisdiction that the Provincial High

Court had exercised. Therefore, this Court has to conclude that

the argument put forward on behalf of the Appellant is an

t

I

IIi I If l II

11

argument belatedly formed without any basis to do so in order to

wrongfully regularize the illegal abuse of Court process the

Appellant had engaged in. This Court does not have any basis or

justification to conclude that the Provincial High Court should

have exercised its revisionary jurisdiction. This follows that there

is no such basis for this Court also to exercise its revisionary

powers. Hence, this Court has to firmly reject this argument.

As has been explained above this Court has to mention here that

the Appellant has deliberately abused the Court process. It is to

be noted that it was on 2002-05-13 that the learned Magistrate

had ordered to demolish the relevant unauthorized construction.

This order could not be enforced due to the abuse of court

process by the Appellant.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to dismiss this Appeal.

The Appellant is directed to pay a sate cost of Rs. 250,000/=.
