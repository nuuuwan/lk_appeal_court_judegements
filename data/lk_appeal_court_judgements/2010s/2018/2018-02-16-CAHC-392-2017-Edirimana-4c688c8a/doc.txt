Learned counsel was heard In support of this

application. The Petitioners have filed this

application in respect of the same grievance that

was the subject matter ln the case bearing No. CA

(Writ) 282/09. That case was filed by a group of

persons.

as well.

The said group includes the petitioners

Perusal of the order made by this court In that

case shows clearly that this court had decided (as

far back as on 2009.10.14) that this is not a fit

case in which this court should issue notices on

the Respondents. This Court on that basis had

refused to issue notices.

Learned counsel for the petitioners conceded in the

course of his submissions that it is the same cause

of action which the petitioners re-agitate in this

application. There is no submission on behalf of

the petitioners that the circumstances prevailed in

the year 2009 has changed.

3

The said order has been produced marked 'A' by the

petitioners. In view of the above situation this

court has no basis to lssue notices on the

Respondents or even to entertain this application.

This court therefore refuses to lssue notices on

the Respondents.

This application must stand dismissed.
