This order pertains to an application made by the Intervenient - Petitioners

to intervene in the application filed by the Petitioner - Respondent.

The Petitioner - Respondent has relied on the Divisional Bench judgment of

this court in the case of Weerakoon and another vs Bandaragama

Pradeshiya Sabhawa.1

This Court in the said Divisional Bench judgment has held that the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 do not provide for third party

interventions in applications for Prerogative Writs.

The Petitioner - Respondent has also cited the order of this Court in the

case of C A (Writ) Application No. 187 / 2016 2 in which this Court has

stated that in view of the said Divisional Bench judgment it is not in a

position to entertain the applications made by third parties for intervention

in that case which is also a writ application.

It is the duty of the Petitioner - Respondent to ensure that all relevant

necessary parties are added to the application because it is he who will

have to face a dismissal, in case this Court finds that he had omitted to add

necessary parties to the application.

As has been done by this Court in C A (Writ) Application No. 187 / 2016 3

and in view of the ruling of the Divisional Bench of this court above

referred to, this Court decides to refuse the application made by the

Intervenient - Petitioners to intervene in the application filed by the

Petitioner - Respondent.

Application for intervention refused.
