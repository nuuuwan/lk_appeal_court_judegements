Samayawardhena, J.

The Applicant (the Food Commissioner under the Ministry of Co-

operatives and Internal Trade)1 as the Competent Authority

made an application for ejectment in the Magistrates Court of

Trincomalee under section 6 of the Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 8 of 1981, as amended,

(hereinafter the Act) to recover possession of the Government

Quarters (in Danyagama Housing Scheme in China Bay) given to

the Petitioners father as an employee of the Prima Ceylon

Limited. The learned Magistrate has, in terms of section 7 of the

Act, issued the writ of possession forthwith. It is against the

said order, the Petitioner has filed this revision application.

CA/MC/REV/7/2014,CA/MC/REV/8/2014,CA/MC/REV/11/2

014,CA/MC/REV/12/2014,CA/MC/REV/13/2014,CA/MC/RE

V/14/2014 are similar cases where the Applicant-Competent

Authority is the same, but the Petitioners are different, in that,

in CA/MC/REV/7/2014, the Petitioner is the son of the Lessee,

and in all the other cases, the Petitioners are overholding

Lessees. Therefore, the learned counsel for the Petitioners and

the learned State Counsel for the Respondents agreed that the

parties in the other connected cases will abide by the Judgment

pronounced in this case.

As seen from the petition, the Petitioner challenges the eviction

order on three grounds. (In the other connected cases also, the

Petitioners are challenging the impugned orders on the same

three grounds.)

1 Vide Y2.

3

The first ground is that the premises are not Government

Quarters provided by the Government but the houses provided by

the private sector obtained on lease from the Government2 and

therefore the Applicant-Competent Authority could not have

used the provisions of the Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act to evict the Respondent and his dependents.3

According to the said submission, the Petitioner admits that the

premises/quarters belong to the Government, but the

Petitioners argument is that, it was given to the Petitioners

father by the private sector obtained on lease from the

Government. This is in the teeth of the admitted document

marked X/06-2014, which is the Tenancy Agreement, entered

into between the Food Commissioner in the Food Commissioners

Department hereinafter called and referred to as the Lessor for

himself and his successors in the said office for the time being

acting for and on behalf of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka as one Part; and the Petitioners father of Prima Ceylon

LTD hereinafter called and referred to as the Lessee as the other

Part.

Hence it is abundantly clear that the premises have not been

given by the private sector as alleged by the Petitioner, but by

the Food Commissioner for and on behalf of the Government.

More importantly, this Tenancy Agreement expressly states that

The demised premises are Government Quarters in terms of the

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act, No.7 of 1969.

2 Vide paragraph 12 of the Petition. 3 Vide paragraph 15 of the Petition.

4

Even though it has not been put in issue by the Petitioner in

this application, I must emphasize that the character of the

occupant is immaterial, so long as the premises in suit are

Government Quarters.

The Act does not speak of Government Employees, but of

Persons or Occupiers in occupation of Government Quarters.

The preamble to the Act reads as follows: An Act to make

provision for the recovery of possession of quarters provided by or

on behalf of the Government or a public corporation for the

occupation of persons, and for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto.

Section 2 explains Application of Act, which reads as follows:

The provisions of this Act (a) shall apply to all Government

quarters; and (b) shall be deemed at all times to have been, and to

be, an implied condition of the occupation by persons of such

quarters.

Sections 3, 4, 6 speak of Occupiers; and section 9, which is the

interpretation section, states: occupier, in the event or the death

of the person who first came into occupation, includes a

dependent of that person.

In defining Government Quarters, section 9, states:

Government quarters means any building or room or other

accommodation occupied for the use of residence which is

provided by or on behalf of the Government or any public

corporation to any person and includes any land or premises in

which such building or room or other accommodation is situated,

5

but does not include any house provided by the Commissioner for

National Housing to which Part V of the National Housing Act

applies.

Hence the first argument fails.

The second ground taken up by the petitioner is that the Quit

Notice is bad in law as it only states that the Petitioners father

has violated the terms of the Lease Agreement without giving

adequate reasons.4

The third ground is connected to the second ground. The third

ground is that the application to the learned Magistrate was

fatally flawed because the reasons given in the application are

not the same as the reasons given in the Quit Notice.5

I cannot understand on what basis the Petitioner states that the

reasons given in the application to Court are different from those

of the Quit Notice. In the Quit Notice (in Form A to the Schedule

to the Act) the reason given is Violation of the Tenancy

Agreement, and the reason given in the application for

ejectment (in Form B to the Schedule to the Act) is Violation of

the Tenancy Agreement by continuing in occupation without legal

authority even after the retirement of service.

There is no complaint that the Quit Notice is not in Form A to

the Schedule to the Act, and the Application for Ejectment

tendered to Court is not in Form B to the Schedule to the Act.

In Form A, there is no requirement to give detailed reasons, and

4 Vide paragraphs 16-20 of the Act. 5 Vide paragraphs 22-24 of the Petition.

6

in Form B, there is a requirement to give little more reasons, in

that, Form B says: State whether the period for which the

Government quarters were given to the occupier has expired, or

whether the occupier has been transferred from the station which

qualified him to occupy the Government quarters, or whether the

occupier to whom the Government quarters were originally given

has died, or any other reason which is considered.

In Balasunderam v. The Chairman, Janatha Estate Development

Board [1997] 1 Sri LR 83 at 88 it was held that: The reasons set

out in Form B are not exhaustive and are merely by way of

illustration; and the reasons contemplated at (iv) above [which

means, any other reason which is considered] need not be

"ejusdem generis". The relevant question is whether such reason

is adequate, which is a matter that would depend on the facts

and circumstances of each case. In interpreting the Act, I have

adopted the principle that words are to be construed in

accordance with the intention as expressed, having regard to the

object or policy of the legislation, which in the instant case is to

facilitate the speedy recovery of Government quarters.

Clause (d) of the Tenancy Agreement, which spells out one of the

several obligations to be discharged by the Lessee, reads as

follows:

To vacate the demised premises immediately the Lessee ceases

to be employed at the Prima Floor Milling Complex at Trincomalee.

A certificate from the District Manager of Prima Ceylon Limited

that the Lessee has ceased to be an employee of Prima Ceylon

Limited shall be treated as final and conclusive for purpose of this

7

Agreement irrespective of any dispute or doubt as to the Lessees

employment with Prima Ceylon Limited.

Admittedly, the Lessee has not vacated the demised premises

immediately after the Lessee ceased to be employed at the Prima

Floor Milling Complex at Trincomalee.

How the application for ejectment shall be made to the

Magistrates Court has been explained in section 6 of the Act. It

is significant to note that section 6(4) thereof particularly states:

Every application for ejectment shall be conclusive evidence of

the facts stated therein.

Section 7(1) of the Act enjoins: Upon receipt of an application for

ejectment in respect of any Government quarters, a Magistrate's

Court shall forthwith issue, and if need be reissue, a writ of

possession to the Fiscal requiring and authorizing such Fiscal

before a date specified in the writ, not being a date earlier than

three or later than seven clear days from the date of the issue of

such writ, to deliver possession of such quarters to the competent

authority or other authorized person specified in the quit notice

relating to such premises.

Section 7(2) of the Act further states that: Notwithstanding

anything in any other law, the issue or re-issue of a writ of

possession under subsection (1) shall not be stayed in any

manner, by reason of any steps taken or proposed to be taken in

any court with a view to questioning the issue or re-issue of such

writ of possession or the quit notice in pursuance of which such

writ of possession is issued or re-issued.

8

When it comes to recovery of possession of Government

Quarters, the Act leaves no room to adopt dilatory tactics to

further stay in occupation of the premises. There is no legal

requirement even to issue notice on the Respondent so long as

Notice to Quit has been served. Upon the application being

properly made to the Magistrate in terms of the Act, the

Magistrate has no alternative but to issue the writ forthwith.

The Act has only nine sections, and the procedure is

conspicuously simplified.

In the case of In re Senanayake (1972) 75 NLR 215, when an

application for ejectment was made under the Act, the learned

Magistrate took the view that notice should be served on the

party against whom the application for a writ is made on the

principle of audi alteram partem. The State moved in revision

against the said order. Samerawickrame J. setting aside the

order of the learned Magistrate stated:

In point of fact after the present application was filed in this

Court the widow of the police officer who had continued to be the

occupier has filed an affidavit. I have perused that affidavit and

do not find in it any matters which are legally relevant to the

question of ejectment. In view of the provision that every

application for ejectment should be conclusive evidence of the

facts set out therein, there is little purpose in notice being issued

on the party against whom the application is made. It appears to

me that this Act makes provision for the issue of writ upon an ex

parte application. It will no doubt be open to the party affected by

an order for issue of writ, if he is able to do so, to bring to the

notice of the Magistrate any matter that may constitute ground for

9

asking that the order for issue of writ should not stand and that

the writ should be recalled. It appears to me however that in the

first instance, upon an application that is regular and in proper

form, the Magistrate has no option but to make order for the issue

of the writ. I set aside the order made by the learned Magistrate

and send the case back with the direction that writ be issued in

terms of section 7.

By Act No. 45 of 1985, sub section 3 was introduced to section 7

of the Principal Act. It reads: Nothing in this Act shall be read

and construed as precluding any person who claims to have been

unlawfully ejected from Government quarters under this section

from instituting an action for damages or other relief. By this

section, the legislature has, to some extent, justified making

eviction orders ex parte.

I reject the second and third arguments.

The application is dismissed with costs.

The parties in CA/MC/REV/7/2014, CA/MC/REV/8/2014,

CA/MC/REV/11/2014, CA/MC/REV/12/2014,

CA/MC/REV/13/2014, CA/MC/REV/14/2014 shall abide by

this Judgment.
