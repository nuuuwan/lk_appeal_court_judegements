The Plaintiff~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff"), being a

minor, instituted this action on 05.05.1994, through her next friend, her father,

against the 1st and 2ndDefendants~Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

"the Defendants") in the District Court of Kuliyapittiya, claiming a sum of

Rs.500,000/~ being damages caused to her person and for the loss of care of her

mother, due to an accident that occurred on or about 21.08.1992 by the negligent act

of the 1st Defendant, who was employed as driver of the lorry belonging to the 2nd

Defendant.

The Defendants filed answer on 20.06.1995 denying the claim of the Plaintiff and

stating that the rider of the motor cycle bearing No.91~5340 on which the Plaintiff

and her mother were riding the pillion was negligent and the accident occurred due

to the contributory negligence of the said rider of the motor cycle and that, in any

event the damages claimed by the Plaintiff is excessive. The Plaintiff's mother died in

consequence of the accident.

When the case was taken up for trial on 30.06.2000, jurisdiction of the Court and the

fact that the 2nd Defendant was the owner of the lorry bearing No.41 Sri 3176 of

which the rt Defendant was the driver on the date of the accident, i.e., 21.08.1992 was

admitted. Thereafter, the Plaintiff raised 1~11 issues and the Defendant raised 1l~14,

and two additional issues 15 and 16 were also raised by the Defendants. The Plaintiff,

her father and two other persons gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff and on

behalf of the Defendants, the rt and 2nd Defendants testified. Thereafter the parties

closed their cases. The learned Additional District Judge delivered his Judgment on

23.11.2000 in favour of the Plaintiff, granting damages in a sum of Rs.75,000/~ for her

personal injuries and for the disruption caused to her educational activities, but

rejected the claim for loss of care and support of her mother. Issue No.8 is in respect

of the loss of care and support of the mother which has been answered in the

negative. Being aggrieved by this judgment, the Plaintiff has preferred this appeal to

this Court.

When the accident occurred on 21.08.1992, the Plaintiff was about 8 years old and a

minor child, who and another daughter were looked after by their deceased mother,

and she was employed as a clerk in the Open University at Nawala, drawing a

monthly salary of Rs.3,OOO/~. According to the evidence, the deceased mother of the

Plaintiff, with this meager salary had been looking after the two children.

As a result of the accident, the Plaintiff was hospitalized for about three months and

thereafter she was unable to go to school and do other work. During this period of

six months she had lost her education by not attending the school. The Plaintiff has

claimed a sum of Rs.100,000r as damages for her personal injuries and another sum

of Rs.400,000r for loss of maternal care and support of her mother due to her

mother'S death, altogether the Plaintiff has prayed for Rs.500,000/~ as damages from

the Defendants.

Contributory Negligence

In cross~examination of the Plaintiff, the defence tried to put the blame on the

Plaintiff for travelling as a pillion rider with her mother and she was to share

contributory negligence. Considering the age of the Plaintiff at the time of the

accident, she cannot be considered a party to contributory negligence. If at all

contributory negligence could be alleged, it must be alleged against the rider of the

motor cycle, Kumaradasa, but the defence tried to put the blame on the Plaintiff and

her deceased mother. Furthermore, no issue on contributory negligence was raised at

the trial by the defence.

Since the Plaintiff and her mother were pillion passengers on the motor cycle, the

lorry driver who came behind them should have been cautious and watchful. He had

knocked the cycle by his careless and negligent driving and caused the death and

injury respectively to the plaintiff's mother and the Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant who

drove the lorry behind the motor cycle is guilty of negligence. According to the

evidence the lorry had gone without stopping.

Conviction is Relevant

A case had been filed by the police in the Kuliyapitiya Magistrate's Court in case

No.98954 against the 1st Defendant and in that case the 1st Defendant had pleaded

guilty to tt, 2nd and 3rd charges and was fined Rs.l,OOO/~ by the Magistrate.

It is laid down that a conviction in a Magistrate's Court case is relevant to a civil

action instituted against the same driver in respect of the same accident. In the case

of Sinniah Nadaraja v. The Ceylon Transport Board 1979(II) N.LR. 48, the

Supreme Court held that where the driver of a vehicle (2nd Defendant) is sued along

with his employer (lst Defendant) for the recovery of damages resulting from an

accident in which the Plaintiff suffered injuries by being knocked down, a plea of

guilt tendered by the driver, when charged in the Magistrate's Court in respect of the

same accident, is relevant as an admission made by him and ought to be taken into

consideration by the trial judge in the civil suit.

The above judgment was followed by this Court in the case Rosairo v. Basnayake

2001(1) Sri LR. 34, where Abdus Salam]. observed, "A plea of guilt is most relevant and

ought to be taken into consideration in assessing the plaintiff's case and further a plea of guilt on a

charge of failing to avoid an accident by the driver cannot be lightly ignored in considering as to

whose negligence it was which caused the accident." See Section 41(A) (2) of the Evidence

ordinance.

Having pleaded guilty to the three charges in the Magistrate's Court Case No.98954

by the 1st Defendant, the defence has no right to suggest contributory negligence on

the part of the rider of the motor cycle or on the pillion passengers. On the admission

of guilt by the pt Defendant, it is admissible evidence that the accident occurred due

to the sole negligence of the 1st Defendant.

The Plaintiffs father has also filed another civil action claiming damages from the

Defendant in D.C. Kuliyapitiya Case No.l0816 in which he was awarded a sum of

Rs.350,000/- as damages for loss of his wife and for funeral and other expenses. The

Plaintiff's father admitted in his evidence that he asked for damages in the case

No.l0816 including loss of care of the wife towards the children. But the Plaintiff in

the present case is claiming Rs.400,OOO/- purely for her own care and support of the

mother. Though in her evidence she has not given clear evidence on the question of

maternal care and support for herself separately, the evidence of her father can be

considered in this respect. The plaintiff's father has given sufficient evidence with

regard to the role played by his deceased wife in looking after the children, the

Plaintiff and her sister.

The death of the mother will give rise to an action against a person who negligently

caused his/her mother'S death. If it is proved that before the death of the mother, she

had been supporting the claimant, the claimant is entitled to claim damages from the

Defendant. In this case it is established that before the death of the Plaintiff's mother,

she had been looking after the children in their want of necessities.

In Lokuge and Another v. Siriwardene and Another 1995(2) Sri L.R. 150, the pt

Plaintiff, an unmarried daughter and the 2nd Plaintiff, a minor son, claiming to be

dependents of the deceased mother, and arising out of loss of support, instituted this

action claiming Rs.l50,OOO/- as damages on the ground that their mother died when

a bus in which she was travelling met with an accident. The District Court granted

the said damages to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs. On appeal the Court of Appeal varied

the award by disallowing the claim of the minor son for the reason that he was 18

years of age at the time of the accident and entitled to an orphan's allowance until

the age of 21 years; and thereafter obliged to support himself, and awarded Rs.50,400

to the Plaintiff.

In the instance case, the Plaintiff was 8 years old at the time of the accident

(21.08.1992) and when she filed the action on 05.05.1994 she was 10 years old. Taking

into consideration of the age of the Plaintiff and other related matters with regard to

the loss of her mother's care and support, I am of the view that the Plaintiff has

actually lost that care and support of her mother at her tender age and therefore she

is entitled to reasonable damages which I assess at Rs.100,000r. I do not want to

disturb the finding of the learned District Judge as to the amount of Rs.75,000/~

awarded for the Plaintiff's personal injuries and educational disturbances caused to

her as a result of the accident in this case.

For the reasons stated above I hold that the Plaintiff is entitled to Rs.100,000/~ being

damages for loss of support of her deceased mother and Rs.75,000r being damages

for her personal injuries, totaling in all a sum of Rs.175,000/~. Subject to this variation

I affirm the judgment of the District Court and allow this appeal.
