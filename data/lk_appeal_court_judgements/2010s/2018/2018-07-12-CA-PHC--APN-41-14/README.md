Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Puttalam bearing case

No. HCR 09/2013 dated 11.11.2013 and to set aside the order of the Learned

".

At the stage of argument, both parties agreed to conclude the case by way of

written submissions and to abide by the SaIile.

Facts of the case:

The Accused was charged in the Magistrate Court of Puttalam for illegal

transportation of 05 square meters of wood valued at Rs.6000.00, an offence

punishable under section 40 read with section 25(1) of the Forest Ordinance (as

amended). The Learned Magistrate of Puttalam, on 09.11.2012, had convicted the

Accused on his own plea and imposed a fine. Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was

conducted with regard to the confiscatior. of the vehicle bearing No. 226-4220,

which was allegedly used for the said offence. After concluding the inquiry, the

Learned Magistrate of Puttalam on 06.03.2013, had ordered to confiscate the

vehicle. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Vehicle Owner of the said vehicle

(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) tiled a revision application bearing No.

HCR 09/2013 in the Provincial High Court of the North Western province holden

in Puttalam to have the said vehicle relea~ed to him. Pronouncing the order dated

11.11.2013, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the revision application.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, tq.e Petitioner preferred an application for

revision in this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Learned Magistrate of

Puttalam had failed to assess the Petition(:-' s evidence and the conclusion of the

Learned Magistrate was misconceived. TIe Learned Magistrate in the Order had

stated as follows;

"erE3~2m~ O@&zrl' ~Jzrl'fi ~ ~825f qa2mO~,", e"t~2mE) otrl'DZ) o8~ 2m~.f. WOE

)2S) @)C) @@ @2S)J8?5)@ " (at page 65 of the Case Record)

Page 4 of 10

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that the conclusion of the

Learned Magistrate of Puttalam was repugnant to the rule of evidence enshrined in

section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, that "No particular number of witnesses

shall in any case be required for the prqof of any fact" and the said misconceived

conclusion itself constitutes an exceptional circumstance to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of this court.

In the present case, what the Learned Magistrate meant was that the witness has

not given evidence to satisfy Court. That does not mean that there should be a

particular number of witnesses in a case. It is evident that the Learned Magistrate

was of the view that evidence of the P,~titioner was not sufficient enough to prove

Court that she had no knowledge of cOlnmitting the offence. The particular issue is

very well explained and adequately ela'::.orated by the Learned High Court Judge.

The Senior State Counsel for the Respondents raised a preliminary objection that

the Petitioner has filed this revision application in March 2014, after a delay of 4 , . months from the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Puttalam dated

11.11.2013. However, the seal of the High Court of the Puttalam on the Petition

reveals that the Petition was filed on 25.11.2013.

In the case of Orient Financial S~rvices Corporation Ltd. v. Range Forest

Officer, Ampara [SC Appeal No. 1~.)/2011], it was held that,

" ... if the owner on the balanc!~ of probability satisfies the court that he had

taken precautions to preventt'he commission of the offence or the offence

was committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission

of the offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner ... "

Page 5 of 10

However the proviso to Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended by Act

No.65 of 2009) reads as follows;

"Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in t/le commission of such offence, is a third

party, no Order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction 0/ the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the

use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case may

be, for the commission of the offence. "

Accordingly it can be construed that the Legislature intended to cast the burden on

the claimant to prove that he took all precautions to prevent the offence being

committed and such burden needs to be discharged on a balance of probability.

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva, Vs. P ,H. De Silva [CA (PUC) 86/97]

Sisira De Abrew, J has stated that,

"For these reasons I hold that gi~i11g mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the

instructions... "

The Learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Petitioner had simply

told the Accused to refrain from any illegal transportation and she had failed to ask ., what was being transported on the particular date. (Page 53 and 57 of the Case

Record).

The Learned Counsel for the Petiti{rler submitted the case of Atapattu

Mudiyanselage Sadi Banda v. OIC, Police Station, Norton Bridge [CA (PUC)

Page Ei of 10

Appeal No. 03/2013- decided on 25.07.~014], in which, Malinie Gunaratne, J,

held that,

"Nevertheless the learned Magistrate has confiscated the lorry. I am of the

view, before making the order of confiscation leaned Magistrate should have

taken into consideration, value of the timber transported, no allegations

prior to this incident that the 10rrY,had been used for any illegal purpose,

that the appellant and or the accuted are habitual offenders in this nature

and no previous convictions, arit' the acceptance of the fact that the

I Appellant did not have any knowt'edge about the transporting of timber

without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that the confiscation t of the lorry is not justifiable ... "

When considering the facts of the case, it ~s evident that the Accused in this case is

not a habitual offender, no previous convictions, etc., but no one can say that the

Petitioner had no knowledge of transporting the timber. Though she had given

instructions to the Accused not to use the ,vehicle for any illegal transportation, the

Petitioner was unable to satisfy the Court that, in fact she had no knowledge of

transporting timber and/or she had taken (,\rery precaution to stop an offence being

committed. Therefore we are of the view that the order of the Learned Magistrate

is in accordance with the law.

In the case of M.Roshan Dilruk Fernando v AG [CA (PH C) 03/2016], it was

held that,

"It is settled law that the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision can be

invoked only on establishing the exi:eptional circumstances. The requirement

of exceptional circumstances has been held in a series of authorities.

Ameen v. Rasheed 3 CL W 8,

Page 70f 10

Rastom v. Hapangama /19787-79J 2 Sri L R 225,

Cader (on behalf of Rashid Kahan) V s Officer - In - Charge

Narcotics Bureau, [2006J3 Sr~ LR 74, , 1 Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. ahd others V. Commissioner of Labour

/1998J 3 SriLR 320 are some of the authorities where it has been

emphasized that unless the existences of the exceptional

circumstances are been established in cases where an alternative

I remedy is available, revisionm "'jurisdiction cannot be invoked ... "

The significance of demonstrating exceptional circumstances had been held III

numerous judgments and it is mandatory to consider them in order to invoke the

jurisdiction of this court.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel & Others (2004) 1 SLR 284 it was held

that,

"To exercise the revisionary jurisdiciion, the order challenged must have

occasioned afailure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which is beyond

an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly

react to it... the order complained of is of such nature which would have

shocked the conscience of the court .. . , , .

In the case of Rasheed Ali v. Mohamed Alt (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only wher:e there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the court ... " ,

Page 8 of 10

In the case of Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 SLLR 225, His Lordship Ismail

stated that,

"the trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers

of the Court of Appeal are invoked' the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available only if the

existence of special circumstances 'tIre urged necessitating the indulgence of

this court to exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then this court will not exercise its powers in

revision. "

In the light of above circumstances, we an~ of the view that the Petitioner has failed

to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances to invoke the .,

revisionary jurisdiction of this court. Tht..:refore, we see no reason to interfere with

the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Puttalam dated 11.11.2013 and the

order of the Learned Magistrate of Puttalam in the case of 71179/121P dated

06.03.2013.

Accordingly the revision application is h~reby dismissed without costs.
