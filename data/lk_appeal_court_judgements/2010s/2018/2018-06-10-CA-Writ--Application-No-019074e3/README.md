The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to seek mandates in

the nature of writs of Mandamus,

a. to direct the 1 st to 11 th Respondents to absorb the Petitioner to the Technical

Service salary group and to pay the areas of salary with effect from 1995,

ie, the year of appointment, and the areas of pension as applicable,

b. to direct the 1 st to 11 th Respondents to amend the Public Administrative

Circular to include the post of Driver Overseer, and the relevant salary code

and grade.

The petitioner submits that in terms of the Public Administrative Circular

No. 96 marked P4, and taking into consideration the duties and responsibilities of

Driver Overseer, the Petitioner was on a higher salary scale than the Public Health

Inspector Grade II and Midwife, as reflected in documents marked P- 4A and P-

4B. However, by Administrative Circular No. 2/1997, (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the circular") the relevant salary scale and grade did not exist for

the post of Driver Overseer and therefore, the Petitioners salary was paid in terms

of the salary scale assigned to Heavy Vehicle Driver Class - I, as reflected in the

relevant documents marked P9, PlO and Pil. The Petitioner pleads that the failure

of the Respondents to include the post of Driver Overseer and the relevant salary

scale and group applicable to the said post, has caused injustice to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has relied on the Judgment in case, C.A. No. 407/2009,

delivered by this Court, marked as P27, and submits that in a similar application

filed by a Driver Overseer, the Respondents were directed by Court to rectify the

discrepancy caused to the said post by amending the circular.

The Petitioners application is based on the said Judgment. It is observed

that the Judgment cited has no bearing to the present application since the terms of

settlement reached in that case was confined to the said case and therefore, has no

precedence for any other application of similar nature, as stated in the said

Judgment.

In this background the Respondents contend that the Petitioner;

5

a. has no legal right to seek a writ of Mandamus to have the said circular

amended for the Petitioner to be absorbed into the Technical Service.

b. the post of Driver Overseer is not an approved post in the Uva Provincial

Public Service, where the Petitioner was attached to, prior to his retirement.

In the circumstances, the Court has to look into whether the conduct

complained by the Petitioner envisage a breach of a specific right and! or the

Respondents failure, to absorb the Petitioner into the Technical Service, by

amending the said circular. The post of Driver Overseer does not exist as an

approved post or salary group in the Uva Provincial Public Service. Therefore, the

Court cannot impose a legal duty upon the Respondents to create a post which is

not recognized by the Uva Provincial Public Service. As noted earlier the

Judgment marked P27, does not create any precedence over this matter.

Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to convince Court of an existing legal right

where the Petitioner has been deprived of by the omission or an act which can be

attributed to the Respondents.

In the case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Vs. Messrs

Jaf/erjiee (Pvt) Ltd. (20051SLR 89), the court held that;

"there is rich and profuse case law on mandamus on the conditions to be

satisfied by the applicant. Some of the condition precedent to the issue of

mandamus appear to be ... ...... "

6

Inter alia, the court held,

"the applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by

the parties against whom the Mandamus is sought ... ....... "

As observed in the said case, "the foundation of Mandamus is the existence

of a legal right." (Napier ex parte 1852 18 QB, 692 at 695)

Accordingly, the Petitioner has no clear legal right to demand the

Respondents to amend the Public Administrative Circular No. 96, which is the

basis in which writ of Mandamus has been sought. Therefore, no legal duty can be

cast upon the Respondents to amend the said circular in order to absorb the

Petitioner to the Technical Service Salary code and grade.

As pointed out by the Respondents, the Petitioner is seeking relief almost

after 9 years of retirement from the Provincial Public Service. No reasons have

been stated for the inordinate delay in submitting this application. Therefore, the

Petitioner is clearly guilty of laches and the action should be dismissed on this

ground alone.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
