ACHALA WENGAPPULI[

In this appeal, the Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the" Appellant") seeks to set aside an order of the Provincial

High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy dated 19.06.2014 in a

revision application No. Rev. 06/2011. The said revision application of the

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent") was filed seeking to set aside an order of ejectment issued

on him by the Magistrate's Court of Dambulla upon an application under

Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the" Act").

After inquiry upon the revision application filed by the Respondent,

the Provincial High Court had set aside the order of ejectment by adopting

~

the reasoning of the judgment of Senanayake v Damunupola(1982) 2 Sri

L.R. 621 and an unreported judgment of the Supreme Court in SC Appeal

No. 138/96. It further "suggested" that the Respondent to obtain a report

from the Surveyor General indicating whether the land in dispute is

located within the final partition plan of the partition action No. P2374 of

the District Court of Matale and FVP No. 349 or not.

The basis of the said order was the Respondent's claim that the land

in dispute is a private land as per the final partition plan of partition action

No. P2374 of the District Court of Matale.

In making his application under Section 5 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act before the Magistrate's Court of Dambulla,

the Appellant had informed Court that he has already issued a quit notice

on the Respondentan.d.upon his failure to hand over vacant possession of

the land described in schedule to the application, he seeks an order of

Court under Section 5 of the said Act.

The Magistrate's Court, after an inquiry to which the Respondent

submitted his position that the land in dispute is a private land, made

order of ejectment since he failed to tender a valid permit or written

authority to remain in possession of the said land. It also held that the

Respondent has failed to establish the identity of the disputed land, when

3

compared with the land described in the schedule to the application and

the material tendered by the Respondent.

This Court has consistently held that when a Competent Authority

has already formed an opinion that a particular land is a State Land and

having served a quite notice on its occupier, makes an application

thereafter to the Magistrate's Court under Section 5 of the said Act, the

Magistrate's Court has no jurisdiction to undertake an inquiry as to the

status of the land in dispute whether it is a State land or a privately owned

land.

In Farook v Gunewardene, Government Agent, Amparai (1980) 2 Sri

L.R. 243, it was held that "The Structure of the Act would also make it appear

that where the Competent Authority had formed the opinion that any land is State

Land, even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion."

The basis for this determination is the statutory provisions contained

in Section 9(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act where it is

stated that" At such inquiry the person on whom summons under Section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any matters stated in the application

under Section 5 ... ".

Section 5 of the said Act contains statutory provisions to indicate that

when a Competent Authority makes an application under its provisions, he

4

must set forth that "the land described in the schedule to the application is

a State land, ... ". The effect of sub section 9(1) of the said Act is to make

this assertion an incontestable fact before the Magistrate's Court to a

Respondent. In addition, Section 9(2) of the said Act debars any

Magistrate's Court from calling any evidence from the Competent

Authority in support of such an application.

In view of these clear and unambiguous statutory provisions, it is

abundantly clear that the Magistrate's Court had not been conferred with

jurisdiction to inquire into the assertions by a Competent Authority in an

application under Section 5 of the said Act.

Except for this error of considering an incontestable fact, the order of

the Magistrate's Court in ejecting the Respondent from the State land

described in the schedule to the application is affirmed by this Court as it

had otherwise correctly applied the relevant principles and issued the

ejectment order. But the Provincial High Court has fallen into error in

revising it on a mis appreciation of the applicable legal principles. The

order of the Provincial High Court is clearly erroneous on two

fundamental points. Firstly, it failed to appreciate the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate's Court over such an application. Secondly if failed to note the

fact that the Respondent is challenging the validity of the claim that the

land in dispute is a State land on an application to revise the order of

ejectment issued by the Magistrate's Court.

5

If a party wishes to challenge the validity of a claim of State land

which in turn would challenge the validity of quit notice issued by a

Competent Authority, it must advise itself properly as to the nature of

remedy it should seek from a competent Court. In Dayananda v

Thalwatte (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 73, referring to a preliminary objection raised

on this point, J ayasinghe J states thus:-

"] hold that the application for revision in terms of Article 138

and on application for Writs of Quo Warranto, Certiorari and

Prohibition under Article 140 of the Constitutions cannot be

combined as they are two distinct remedies available to an

aggrieved party and for that reason the Petition is fatally

flawed."

As per the principle enunciated in this judgment, when the

Respondent sought to challenge the validity of the claim of the Appellant

that the land in which the Respondent is in unauthorised possession is a

State land in a revision application against an ejectment order made by the

Magistrate's Court and not in an application for judicial review, his

application is "fatally flawed."

In relation to the applicability of the judgment of Senanayaka v

Damunupola (supra), de Silva Lin CA(PHC)APN 29/2016 - decided on 9th

July 2018, observed that "... the ratio decidendi in Senanayaka v

Damunupola(supra) is no longer valid" since the amendment Act No. 29 of

6

1983 which was brought in view of the said judgment" ... to provide a swift

and effective procedure by which the State can recover possession of State land ... ".

The other judgment relied upon by the Provincial High Court, the

judgment of Jayamaha and Others v JEDB and Others S.C. Appeal No.

138/96 - decided on 26.02.1999 was decided on a different factual setting.

In the said appeal, the Appellant, who had been served with a quit notice,

tendered to Court several receipts by the Competent Authority had

accepted payments as rentals. Considering this factual position, their

Lordships issued a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice as the

Appellant was not in "unauthorised possession or occupation". The facts are

therefore clearly distinguishable from that of the instant appeal before us.

In relation to the claim of the Respondent that the land in dispute is

in fact not a State land but private land owned by him, Section 12 provides

remedy for such claims. In CA No. 1299/87 decided on 14.06.1995, where a

Writ of Certiorari waS sought to quash the issuance of a quit notice, it was

decided that" ... the notice is the first step in the process of recovering possession

of State land from persons in unauthorised possession or occupation. It does not

relate to title and any dispute as to title should be resolved in an action that may be

filed as provided in Section 12 of the Act."

Therefore, having considered the submissions of the parties

carefully, we are of the view that the appeal of the Appellant ought to be

allowed. Accordingly, the order of the Provincial High Court on 19th June
