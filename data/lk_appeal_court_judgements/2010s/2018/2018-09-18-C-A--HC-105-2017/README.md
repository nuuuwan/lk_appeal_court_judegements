ACHAIA WENGAPPULI T.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

was ir.dicted before the High Court of Polonnaruwa for committing

murder of his wife Herath Mudiyanselage Ruvini Takshila on or about 14th

July 2004. After a t:ial without a jury, as per the election of the Appellant,

he was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to death. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant sought to

challenge its validity on the following grounds of appeal;

i. the trial Court failed to consider that a conviction could not be

based purely or solely-on "last seen theory" as the prosecution

did not prove the exact time of death,

ii. the trial Court erred by comparing the contents of the dock

statement with the prosecution case,

111. the trial Court erred when it concluded that the prosecution

has proved its case before the Court considered his dock

statement,

IV. the trial Court erred when it accepted the evidence in relation

to the complaint to Police by the deceased against the accused,

as the motive,

2

.-...... ---.'-..... -.. -.---------.-.-~-----------.--.-----... -----.'--~.

Since these several grounds of appeal requires consideration of the

evidence presented before the trial Court in its entirety, it is helpful to refer

to the nature of evidence led by the prosecution and the Appellant.

The prosecution case is based essentially on items of circumstantial

evidence. The Appellant and the deceased were married for over 12 years

and had two children. The Appellant was a soldier of Sri Lanka Army. At

the time of the death of the deceased, they were living with the deceased's

mother in Dummalasuriya Police area. According to the mother of the

deceased and her brother, the deceased had left her home at about 8.00 am

on the 14th July 2004 with the Appellant to attend an inquiry conducted by

Polonnaruwa Police. The deceased had made a complaint against the

Appellant but the details of the complaint is not known to witnesses. The

deceased did not return home thereafter and after three days, upon being

notified by Polonnaruwa Police, they identified her body at Polonnaruwa

Hospital.

On 14th July 2004, the security officers who manned the entrance to

the ruins of Galviharaya site called up the Appellant and the deceased as

they entered the site and their appearance aroused some concern. The

security officers had already been directed by the Police to record the

details of couples who enter the site on foot, since there was a spate of

"murders" that had taken place in the archaeological area. Acting on this

direction Wasantha Kumara recorded the name and number of the identity

card issued to the Appellant by Sri Lanka Army. As the deceased had no

3

-,-_._- .. _""' .... -"-_..-_---_.,-------_ .. _,-,----,-_ ... _.;,--------

------------------------------------------------,-------------------------------

identification only her name was recorded in the book maintained for that

purpose. The officers noted that the sturdy Appellant was dressed smartly

with a T shirt and a denim while the relatively thin deceased with a darker

complexion, who was introduced to the officers as the wife of the

Appellant was shabtily dressed. When t\ey saw the couple entering the

sacred site, the deceased was lagging behind the Appellant in about 50 feet

in distance between them. The time of recording of the entry is 5.49 p.m.

The sxred site is open to visitors from 6.00 a.~. to 6.00 p.m. and

accordingly the Appellant was advised by the security officers to leave the

site as it was closing time. However, the couple went in the direction of the

"Palace".

On the 15th July, witness Priyadharshar..i, a resident of the area went

to have a bath at about 2.00 p.m. in the nearby canal that brings water from

Parakrama Samudra to the paddy lands. She was alerted by another of

feeing a body of a human in the water. She saw a body floating under

water and when another person brought it to the can;-il bank, she covered it

with a cloth. The body is of a woman. When some of the security officers

got to know about it they identified it as the body of the deceased whom

they saw the previous evening wi:h the Appellant. Her clothing was

identified by the witnesses. They were the clothing she wore when she left

her house in the previous morning. The body also had a wrist watch.

It is stated in evidence that the canal runs along the land area

belongs to the Archaeological Department where the Galvihara ruins are

4

-.. -. ~ --- ----.----.--~--~-----_ .. ,- ------~.--.--.-----

located and the body was recovered downstream to this land area. The

prosecution evidence is that the Appellant is last seen with the deceased in

the same area at 5.49 p.m. when the Security Officers had told them to

leave since its closing time.

The medical evidence revealed that the deceased had died due to

vagal inhibition which in tum caused by strangulation by ligature. The

suicide by hanging was excluded owing to the nature of injuries on the

neck since the medical officer observed several injuries which she termed

as imprint abrasions. She could not- pronounce exact time of death as the

post mortem examination was performed only on the 19th July 2004, but

places the time since death sometime beyond 1 1/2 days prior to her

examination.

It is also revealed that the Police were altered by the villagers about

the discovery of a body and during their investigations they received

information about the Appellant who accompanied the deceased the

previous evening. The Appellant was traced to Giritale Army Camp where

he was arrested on 16th July 2004 at about 2.20 p.m.

After the Appellant was produced before the l\1agistrate's Court, an

identification parade was held, and he was identified by the security

officers, who recorded his personal information, as the person with whom

the deceased was last seen alive. The identification of the Appellant at the

5

--_._----_.-------------------- ---------------'

parade was recorded as an admission under Section 420 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the trial Court called for

his defence. In his statement from the dock he denied any involvement

with the death of the deceased and took up an alibi stating that he

attended the inquiry at Dummalasuriya Police upon a complaint against

him by the deceused as he could not return home for few months due to

exigencies of his service. He further stated that having come to

Polonnaruwa with the deceased, after inquiry and visited the sacred area

on her request, he boarded a bus from kaduruwela at about 2.30 p.m. to

reach his camp. Before leaving her he has instructed the deceased to return

horne on her own. He later came to know that he is accused for her death.

It is agai"nst this backdrop of evidence, we should proceed to

consider the several grounds of appeal of the Appellant.

In support of the first ground of appeal, learned Counsel for the

Appellant submitted that a conviction for murder could not be solely

based on the last seen theory and us such the trial Court fallen into error in

convicting the Appellant for murder. It could be reasonably inferred that

this submission is essentially based on the assumption that the only item of

evidence led before the trial Court is the fact that the deceased was last

seen alive in the company of the Appellant. This particular item of

evidence, presented by independent witnesses, substantiated by

contemporaneouG official record, no doubt is the strongest item of 6

____ ,. ____ .t- ...... __ ._ ... _- _____ _ -----_ .. __ ._-----------------

evidence that the prosecution presented before the trial Court and relied

upon.

But that is not all tLe evidence presented by the prosecution. As

reprod uced above in summery form, there were other items of evidence in

relation to the Appellant's previous and subsequent conduct, in addition

to tlds evidence. The perusal of the Jud3"ment of the trial Court revealed

that it had referred to all these items of evidence to arrive at the

inescapable and irresistible inference that was drawn against the

Appellant's presumption of innocenc~. Therefore, the Appellant's first

ground of appeal fails.

This finding leads to the consideration of his second ground of

appeal. The Appellant's contention is that the trial Court had compared

the evidence led before it, by the prosecution and the Appellant, side by

side and thereby imposing a burden of proof on the Appellant.

It is clearly seen upon perusal of the Judgment what the trial

Court has done w~th the evidence presented by the parties is to have them

compared with, in order to arrive at a conclusion <.is to the credibility of the

evidence. In fact, the Appellant, in his statement from the dock, had

admitted and even explained certain items of evidence presented by the

prosecution. When the mother of the deceased gave evidence, she had no

idea about the nature or the contents of the complaint her daughter had

7

made to the Police. She was undeI the impression that in fact it was made

to Polonnaruwa Police. But the Appellant, in his statement said that the

deceased had lodged a complaint with Dummalasuriya Police over his

long absence from m<1trimonial home zUld he was directed to attend an

inquiry. He further admitted that he did attend t:le inquiry with the

deceased. He further admitted that thereafter they came to Polonnaruwa

and, upon the request of the deceased, visited the ruins.

This shows that the Appellant, hu.ving admitted part of the

prosecution evidence, sought to dispute its most damning item of evidence

by stating that he left the deceased by 2.30 p.m. since he had to report back

to his camp, which is in total conflict with the prosecution's evidence that

he was with the deceased at 5.49 p.m. at the entrance to the ruins. It is in

these circumstances that the trial Court considered the evidence in the way . . it did and finally concluded that the Appellant's claim that he left the

deceased at 2.30 p.m. on the 14th July 2004 could not be accepted as a

truthful version of events.

In the light of these considerations it is appropriate to consider

the last two grounds of appeal at the same time.

The trial Court had itemised the several items of circumstantial

evidence presented before it by the prosecution. When the prosecution

evidence if, considered in its entirety, as the trial Court correctly did, it

satisfies the criterion laid down in King v Appuhamy46 N.L.R. 128 as it

was held, 8

/I in order to justify the inference of guilt from purely

circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of

explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that 4

his guilt. "

In a more recent judgment of Karunaratne v Attorney General

(2005)2 Sri L.R. 233, thi~ Court re-empLasisClI the following principles in

relation to the prosecutions based on circumstantial evidence;

"In the case of State of Y.P. vs Dr. Ravindra Prakash

lvlittal(1992) 2 SCI 549, it was held that the essential ingredients

to prove guilt of an accused person by circumstantial evidence

are:-

1. The circumstances from which the conclusion was

drawn should be fully proved:

2. The circumstances should be conclusive in nature;

3. All the facts so established should be consistent

with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with

mnocence;

4. The circumstance should; to a moral certainty,

exclude the possibility of guilt of any person other

than the accused.

The Court proceeded to cite another Indian judgment to high light

another relevant consideration in rdation to prosecutions based on

circumstantial evidence as it reproduced the following quotation;

9

-"" .. ,," . . -._,-_ ..... ----------}. . ..:-..... ~-----.-~---.. - -"'.~---- ---_._-----

"In the case of State of Tamil Nadu vs Rajendran 1999 Cri.L. J.

4552, justice Pittanaik observed that" In a case of circumstantial

evidence when an incriminating cii':umstance is put to the

accused and the said accused either offers no explanation or offers

an explanation which is found to be untrue, then the same

becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstance to make it

complete"

The Apex Court, in its judgment of S.C. Apped 232/2014 - S.c. M.

of 11.07.2017, quoted the same pa~sage from the judgment of Supreme

Court of India in Tamil Nadu v Rajendran (1999) Cr. L.J. 4552 as the Court

of Appeal did in Karunaratne v Attorney General.

The prosecution has prese:nted a strong prima facie ca~;e against the

Appellant.

It is already noted that the Appellant, in his statement from the dock

stated that he left at 2.30 p.m. for his camp leaving the deceased in

Polonnaruwa. This is in relation to an alibi he presented before the trial

Court. The presence of the Appellant with the deceased at 5.49 p.m. on the

14t~1 July 2004, at the entrance to the ruins was well established by the

prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a fact in issue, which was

to be decided by the trial Court. When the Appellant, having had the

benefit of listening to the evidence presented by the prosecution, stated in

his dock statement that he had left Polonnaruwa by 2.30 p.m. for the first

time in Court only in his dock statement. In Gunasiri a:1d two Others v

10

___ 'r_-~ ____ _____ ___ ~ ____ ... '~_'&_. __ ....... _ ............ ___ _____ ~_ ... I _ _

..

Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 39, it was held that "failure to suggest

the defence of alibi to the prosecution witnesses who implicated the accused

indicates that it was a false one."

When he lied in Conrt that he was elsewhere, that fact provided 1/ an

additional link in the chain of circumstances" as per the judgment of Tamil

Nadu v Rajendran. It is in consideration of all these items of evidence that

we reach the irresistible and inesc ... lpable inference that t1le Appellant is

guilty of murder, as the cumulative effect of the several items of

circumstantial evidence does not support any other hypothesis other than

the guilt of the Appellant.

The complaint that the trial Court erred when it conclucled that the

prosecution has proved its case before the Court considered the dock

statement is a mistaken notion based on the way the trial Court sought to

present its reasons for convicting the Appellant. The trial Court had

segmented the two cases and after the prosecution's case, it had stated that

the case was proved against the Appellant. The trial Court, then proceeded

to consider the case for the Appellant. If the trial Court had already arrived

at a conclusion about the guilt of the Appellant, then it need not consider

the case presented by him.

The other complaint that the trial Court erred when it accepted the

evidence in relation to the complaint to Police by the deceased against the

11

_~ _____________________ _____ , _________ . __ -,_-..I

e.

"

Clccused, as the motive, is a reasonable inference from the available

evidence. When the deceased lodged a complaint against the Appellant,

who was her husband for the past twelve years and a soldier attached to a

camp in the operational area, compelling him to attend an inquiry in a

Jistant Police stati0l-., would naturally crea~e a resentful feeli:pg in his

mind. This item and the inference that could be drawn from it would not

suffice to sustain a conviction of murder, if taken in total isolation from the

rest of the e,'idence. However, in this instance, it is a reasonable inference

to draw, when taken in conjuncticn with the evidence of the security

officers that the couple's behaviour in that evening is not of a normal

behaviour observed from the others:

In consideratio::1 of the submissions of the Appella..."'1t, it is our view

that the sevEral gruunds of appe3.1 raised by him cannot be considered as

grounds of 3ppeal with some merit, that would have the effect of viti"ting

hb conviction. Therefore, we affirm the conviction and sentence imposed

by the High Court.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed.
