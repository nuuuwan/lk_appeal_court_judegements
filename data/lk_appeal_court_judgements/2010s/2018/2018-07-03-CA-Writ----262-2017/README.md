A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter alia, seeking

mandates in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash the Special Commodity Levy

Gazette Notification bearing Nos. 1891/8 dated 02112/2014, marked X4, 1898/43

dated 22/01/2015, marked X5, 1907/19 dated 25/03/2015, marked X6, and

1913102 dated 05/05/2015, marked X7, and the Revenue Protection Order bearing

Gazette Notification No. 1913/3 dated 05105/2015, marked X8.

The said reliefs are sought on the basis of a claim for a refund! release of

revenue paid in excess of the amount chargeable on imports in terms of Section

18( 1) of the Customs Ordinance.

When this case was taken up for support for notice, the ASG, appearing for

the Respondents raised the following preliminary objections to the maintainability

of this application.

a) The undue delay caused in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court.

b) The futility of this application on the basis that the benefits, if granted,

cannot reach the consumer at this stage.

It is observed that, the Gazette Notifications sought to be quashed are dated

2 to 3 years prior to the date, the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

In paragraphs 9, 10 and 11, the Petitioner submits that the Gazette Notifications

marked X4, X5, and X6, have already been rescinded by the Minister of Finance.

In support of this application the respective parties have cited several

Judgments, where the Court has looked into the issue of undue delay in making an

application for judicial review.

In the case of Biso Menika Vs. Cyril de Alwis (1982) lSLR 368 at page

378, the court held,

"the proposition that the application for writ must be sought as soon as

injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine and

delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a writ

application dwindle and the court may reject a writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay. "

Accordingly, the length of the delay, the extent and the effect of the

decision under challenge are relevant factors.

It is trite law that, the Courts will not assist a claimant who sleeps on his

rights. Therefore, a claimant must bring his claim promptly. On the question of

promptness, a Court can refuse a remedy where there has been undue delay. As

noted earlier, the delay in filing this application for judicial review is more than

two to three years from the date of the impugned Gazette Notifications. The delay

in filling action is unexplained and on this ground alone this application should be

refused.

5

It is also observed that, as of now, the Commodity Levy charged on the

commodity items imported by the Petitioner, has passed on to the customer, by its

inclusion in the sale price of the relevant commodity item. Prayers (d) and (i) of

the Petition shows that the intention of the Petitioner, of filing this application, is

to appropriate the said commodity levy charged (already passed on to the

consumers) to his benefit. Such a move is neither justifiable nor is in line with

principles of equity referred to in the Judgment cited above. As such any relief

granted to the Petitioner at this stage, would adversely affect the rights of the

consumer. The Commodity Levy passed on to the consumer, if remedied, would

also be detrimental to good administration.

In the circumstances, notice is refused and the Petition is dismissed without

costs.

I agree.
