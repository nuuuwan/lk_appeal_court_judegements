Written Submissions:

by the Intervenient Petitioners on 26.06.2018

by the Petitioners-Respondents on 28.06.2018

Decided on: 03.07.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st petitioner is the manager and the 2nd-11th petitioners are

office bearers of the Special Education Development Services

Society which was the governing body of the school relevant to this

application until the 1st respondent Secretary to the Ministry of

Education took over the management of the school from the

petitioners and handed it over to the 4th respondent. The

petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by way of

certiorari the said decision of the 1st respondent and also the

decision of the 1st respondent to reinstate the 5th-7th respondent

teachers whose services were discontinued by the 1st petitioner

earlier.

After filing of this application, the proposed intervenient petitioners

made an application to intervene in the action, which was objected

to by the petitioners. This order is on that issue.

After the Divisional Bench decision of this Court in Weerakoon v.

Bandaragama Pradeshiya Sabawa1 the law is settled that no

1 [2012] BLR 310

intervention is permitted in writ applications. This decision has

consistently been followed by later decisions of this Court.2

Counsel for the intervenient petitioners says that those decisions

are per incuriam as they have been made without regard being had

to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Wijeratne (Commissioner

of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero.3 I am

unable to agree. Wijeratnes case (supra) is certainly not an

authority to say that intervention is permitted in writ applications.

What was considered in that case was the question of making

necessary parties to a writ application and not the question of

intervention in a pending writ application, which are two different

matters. Whilst emphasizing that the Supreme Court did not in

that case decide that in writ applications intervention is permitted,

I must state with respect that whatever may have been stated on

intervention in that case is obiter dicta and not ratio decidendi.

Conversely, the only matter decided by the Divisional Bench of this

Court in Weerakoons case (supra) was intervention and nothing

else and that is the ratio decidendi of that case.

On that ground alone the application for intervention shall be

dismissed.

However, for completeness, let me now consider why the

intervenient petitioners say that they shall be allowed to intervene

in this action. That is on the basis that they are necessary parties

to the action.

2 Nadaraja v. Suriyarachchi CA/187/2016/WRIT decided on 05.10.2016, India

Meditronic (Pvt) Ltd v. Meditek CA/99/2014/WRIT decided on 26.01.2017, Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians v. Jayasinghe CA/408/2015/WRIT decided on 11.01.2017, Gunapalan v. Minister of Rural Economic Affairs CA/431/2016/WRIT decided on 07.06.2018. 3 [2011] 2 Sri LR 258

If they are necessary parties, the 5th-7th respondents who are

supporting the application of the intervenient petitioners can take

up that position, and if the Court holds with the said respondents

on that point, the petitioners' application can be dismissed in

limine without considering the merits.

On what basis do the intervenient petitioners say that they are

necessary parties? That is on the basis that they would be affected

in the event this Court decides to quash the decision of the 1st

respondent to handover the management of the school from the

petitioners to the 4th respondent. If I may elaborate on that point,

what the intervenient petitioners say is that unlike when it was in

the hands of the petitioners, the school under the new

management is functioning properly, and grave prejudice would be

caused to the intervenient petitioners and the school as a whole if

the management again falls back to the petitioners.

If that argument is to be accepted as the base for intervention, not

only the thirteen intervenient petitioners who are two deputy

principles, six teachers and parents of five students of the school

respectively, all the teachers, parents and probably the students

are all necessary parties as all of them quite obviously aspire to see

smooth functioning of the school for the greater benefit of the

students.

I need hardy emphasize that the power to issue writs vested by

Article 140 of the Constitution in this Court is a supervisory power

and not an appellate jurisdiction (The Board of Trustees of the

Tamil University Movement v. F.N. de Silva4) and in exercising the

writ jurisdiction, this Court will not consider whether the decision

is right or wrong in the context of the greater benefit of the society

4 [1981] 1 Sri LR 350)

5

or otherwise, but whether the decision is lawful or unlawful in the

eyes of the law. (Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central

Environment Authority5)

The petitioners have made the party whose decision is sought to be

quashed and the parties directly affected by the outcome of this

case as respondents to this application.

In the facts and circumstances of this case I do not think that the

intervenient petitioners are necessary parties to this application.

Application for intervention is refused with costs.
