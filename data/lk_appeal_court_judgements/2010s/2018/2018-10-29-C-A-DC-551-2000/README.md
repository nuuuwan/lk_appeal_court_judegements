Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs instituted this action against the defendants

seeking declaration of title to the land described in the schedule

to the plaint, ejectment of the defendants therefrom and

damages. The plaintiffs thereafter, upon a commission issued

through Court, depicted the exact portion of land which they

claim by way of a Plan, which was marked at the trial as X. The

plaintiffs claim Lot 1 of the said Plan. The defendants filed the

answer stating that the plaintiffs are only entitled to the house

marked A in Lot 1 of the above Plan, and the entire land shown

in the said Plan is owned by the defendants. After trial, the

learned District Judge, by the Judgment dated 21.08.2000 held

that the plaintiffs are entitled to Lot 1 of Plan X including the

house standing on it and dismissed the other reliefs. The

defendants have preferred this appeal against this Judgment.

At the argument before this Court, learned counsel for both

parties agreed to dispose of argument by way of written

submissions, which have now been filed.

Learned counsel for the appellants takes up only two points in

his written submissions to say that the Judgment of the District

Court shall be set aside.

(a) The learned District Judge has not complied with

section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code in that no

reasons have been given for the decision.

(b) The plaintiffs have failed to identify the portion of land

which they claim.

Let me now deal with those two arguments.

In pursuance of the first argument, learned counsel for the

appellants has quoted the section 187 of the Civil Procedure

Code and two Judgments. That is all he has done. There is no

dispute to accept it on principle, but I cannot understand on

what basis the learned counsel for the appellants states that the

learned trial Judge has not complied with section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code when the learned trial Judge has given

adequate reasons to her decision. Conversely, it is the learned

counsel who has not given any reason why he says that the

learned trial Judge has not complied with section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

The first argument of the appellants is wholly devoid of merit.

The second argument of the appellants is no better. It is true

that the plaintiffs have described the portion of land they claim

by extent and boundaries sans the name of the land in the

schedule to the plaint. In the plaint the land they claim has not

been identified by way of a Plan. However, before the answer

was filed, the plaintiffs got a commission issued to properly

identify the portion of land they claim. It is thereafter the

defendants filed the answer, and in the answer, they referred to

the said Plan. Then at the trial, the plaintiffs raised an issue

whether the land described in the schedule to the plaint is

depicted as Lot 1 in the said Planvide issue No.2. This issue

has been accepted without any objection and answered by

learned trial Judge in the affirmative in the Judgment. There

was no issue raised contesting the identification of the land at

the trial.

It is trite law that the case is not tried on the pleadings, once

issues are raised and accepted by the court the pleadings recede

to the background. (Hanaffi v. Nallamma [1998] 1 Sri LR 73 at 77

per G.P.S de Silva C.J., Vide also: Dharmasiri v. Wickrematunga

[2002] 2 Sri LR 218, Gunasinghe v. Samarasundara [2004] 3 Sri

LR 28, Kulatunga v. Ranaweera [2005] 2 Sri LR 197, Peiris v.

Siripala [2009] 1 Sri LR 75 at 78) Hence it is pointless in appeal

for the appellants to argue that the plaintiffs have failed to

properly identify the land in suit in the plaint.

Hence the second argument must also fail.

For the aforesaid reasons, the Judgment of the District Court is

affirmed and the appeal is dismissed but without costs.
