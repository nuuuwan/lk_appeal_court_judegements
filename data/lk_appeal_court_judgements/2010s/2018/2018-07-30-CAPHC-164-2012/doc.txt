ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

" Appellant") invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside an

order of the Provincial High Court holden in Negombo. With the

pronouncement of the said order, the Provincial High Court has dismissed

the Appellant's application to revise the order of ejectment issued by the

Magistrate's Court of Negombo in case No. G 38377.

Case No. G 38377 of Magistrate's Court of Negombo relates to an

application made by the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the "Respondent") made under Section 6(1) of the

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1969 as

2

amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act), to recover possession of

Government quarters at No. 74/ A, Daluwakotuwa, Kochchikade belonged

to Road Develppment Authority.

The Respondent claimed that he has issued a notice to quit on

07.01.1998 against the Appellant and upon his failure to hand over vacant

possession on the due date, he moved Court to issue a writ of possession.

The Magistrate's Court has issued a writ of possession on 02.11.1998

under Section 7(1) of the Act, upon the ~aid application by the Respondent.

The Fiscal of the Court reported that he has executed writ of possession on

22.01.1999 by removing the belongings of the Appellant outside the

premises of the quarters. He has then handed over the vacant possession to

the representative of the Respondent. However, the Appellant has forcibly

re-occupied the quarters thereafter disregarding the Court order having

used abusive language on the officers of Court.

At a subsequent stage the Respondent has re-issued a quit notice on

18.06.2002 but withdrew it again on 27.12.2002. The Appellant claims that

he has challenged the 2nd quit notice by seeking a Writ of Certiorari before

this Court. As the Respondent agreed to withdraw the 2nd quit notice, he

too has withdrawn his Writ application. However, the Respondent has

reserved his right to pursue eviction under the quit notice which has

already served.

3

Thereafter, the Magistrate's Court has issued a writ of possession for

the 2nd time on 30.04.2010 and the Appellant sought to revise the said

order before the Provincial High Court.

In dismissing the Appellant's application for revision, the Provincial

High Court held that there were no exceptional circumstances established

by the Appellant. It also noted that the order sought to be revised is dated

02.11.1998 and the Appellant is guilty of laches.

In support of the appeal, learned Counsel for the Appellant made

submissions on the basis that the Provincial High Court was in error when

it failed to consider the fact that "the quit notice itself is against the

provisions of the act" as an exceptional circumstance. In addition, it was

contended that there was no undue delay.

The Appellant also contended that the disputed premises is not used

as a "residence" on the basis of the interpretation of the term "Government

quarters" .

In view of the submissions of the Appellant, it is appropriate at this

stage to consider whether the Provincial High Court was in error when it

dismissed his application for revision.

4

The Appellant invoked its revisionary jurisdiction to. set aside the

writ of possession issued against the quarters in which he operated his

office as a Grama Niladhari. In such an instance, the Provincial High Court

should consider the Appellant's application, as per the judgment of

Nissanka v State(2001) 3 Sri L.R. 78;

1. to satisfy itself as to the legality of the impugned order,

2. to satisfy itself as to the propriety of the impugned order,

3. to satisfy itself as to the regularity of the proceedings of the Court

below.

When an application for ejectment is made under Section 7(1) of the

Act against an "occupier" of any Government quarters, a Magistrate must

issue a writ of possession. He was not conferred with a discretion by the

said section to consider any ground other than what is stated in the

application. Whether the Government quarters was in fact used by the

"occupier" as his residence or for any other purpose is not a relevant

consideration before the Magistrate's Court. Similarly, whether the quit

notice complies with the relevant statutory provisions or not is also

beyond the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court. Section 6(4) of the Act is

clear as it states that "Every application for ejectment shall be conclusive

evidence of the facts stated therein." Therefore, when the Respondent

stated that the premises occupied by the Appellant is Government

quarters, the Magistrate's Court has no jurisdiction to allow the Appellant

to contest that fact.

In these circumstances, when the Provincial High Court examines

the validity of the issuance of a writ of possession by a Magistrate's Court,

5

in the light of the considerations enumerated in Nissanka v State there is

no basis for it to hold that such an order could be termed as illegal or

improper. If the issuance of an order of eviction is not tainted with any

such error then there is no basis for the Provincial High Court to interfere

with the issuance of writ of possession. The grounds urged by the

Appellant are only relevant if he sought judicial review of the quit notice

before a competent Court. In Dayananda v Thalwatte (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 73 it

was held that revisionary jurisdiction cannot be combined with writ

jurisdiction.

Therefore, it is our considered view that the appeal of the Appellant

I is devoid of any merit and accordingly it ought to be dismissed.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

25,000.00.
