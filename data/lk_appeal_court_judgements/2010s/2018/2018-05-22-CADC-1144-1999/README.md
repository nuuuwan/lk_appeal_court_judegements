DEFENDANT ~ RESPONDENTS

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J.

Nayomi Kahawita, SC for the 1st Defendant~ Appellant

Hemantha Botheju for the Plaintiff~ Respondent

28.11.2016

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

he 1st Defendant~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the 1st

Defendant") has preferred this appeal against the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Kurunegala dated 18.10.1999.

The Plaintiff~Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action in the District Court of Kurunegala seeking inter alia a declaration

that the election of the Alawwa Sasanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya (ASBM) held on

28.08.1997 was null and void and a fresh election be held according to the Constitution

of the ASBM.

When the matter came up for trial on 01.06.1999, the parties recorded fifteen

admissions and raised twenty seven issues, among which the 1st to 1th issues were

raised on behalf of the Plaintiff, whilst the 18th to 26th issues were raised on behalf of

the 1st Defendant. The 2th issue was raised as a consequential issue by the Plaintiff.

(see pages 94~ 101 of the brief)

The Plaintiff testified first and the examination in chief of the Plaintiff was concluded

on the 2nd day of the trial namely 17.08.1999. Even though the cross~examination of the

Plaintiff did not conclude on the said 2nd day of trial, it was decided that the parties

would dispose of their respective cases by way of written submissions. The learned

District Judge delivering his judgment dated 18.10.1999 allowed the relief prayed for in

the Plaint.

When this matter was taken up for argument in this Court, the learned State Counsel

brought to the notice of court that since the year 1999, a number of changes had taken

place and therefore at present none of the 6th, th and 8th Defendants held office in the

ASBM, and moreover, the 8th Respondent has since passed away. The term of office of

the 6th, th and 8th Respondents in the ASBM had ended a long time ago, and several

elections to the ASBM have been subsequently held since the delivery of the judgment

on 18.10.1999.

When this Appeal was taken up for argument, the learned State Counsel Ms. Nayomi

Kahawita on behalf of the 1st Defendant~Appeliant informed the court that despite her

best endeavours to settle this matter, she was unable to do so as the learned trial Judge

in delivering his impugned judgment dated 18.10.1999 had collectively answered all the

issues raised by the Plaintifr Respondent in the affirmative, and among such answers

the answer to Issue No.26, includes amongst others, a relief for cost of litigation against

the State and in the circumstances she could not effect a settlement, least of all a

withdrawal of the appeal. However, since the Plaintiff was not inclined to waive the

claim for cost of litigation against the State, the parties intimated that the Court could

proceed to pronounce its judgment on the written submissions of parties.

The learned State Counsel has sought to impugn the judgment dated 18.10.1999 on the

following grounds.

The judgment dated 18.09.1999 does not fulfill the requirements stipulated in

Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code

The complaint is that both the issues raised on behalf of the Plaintiff~Respondent as

well as those of the Defendant~ Respondent have been answered collectively and there

are no separate answers to each issue raised by the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The

learned State Counsel has contended that the court is bound to provide answers to all

the questions raised in a civil case. She has drawn attention of court to HanafD v.

NaUamma (1998) 1 Sri LR. 73 at page 77 wherein the oft cited pronouncement of His

Lordship G.P.S. De Silva, CJ occurs~

"..... once issues are framed, the case, which the court has to hear and determine becomes

crystallized in the issues and the pleadings recede to the background. .. ".

Germane to the above is Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code which stipulates the

requirements of a judgment thus:

" The judgment shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the

decision thereon, and the reasons for such deCision, and the opinion of the assessor (if any) shall

be prefixed to the judgment and Signed by such assessors respectively ... ".

5

In the case of Warnakula v. RamaniJayawardene 1990 (1) Sri LR. 206 it has been

held:

" ..... bare answers to issues without reasons are not in compliance with the requirements of

section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The evidence germane to each issue must be reviewed or

examined. The Judge must evaluate and consider the totality of evidence, giving a short summary

of the evidence of the parties ad witnesses and stating that he prefers to accept the evidence of one

party without giving reasons are insufficient....".

Therefore, it is indubitable that there is a bounden legal duty cast upon the Court to

answer and/or provide answers to the issues raised in a case. Whether there is a legal

duty entrusted upon the court to answer each issue separately has been discussed in a

number of reported cases. In the case of Horagalage Sopinona v. Kumara

Ratnakeerthi Pitipanarachchi and others SC Appeal No. 49/2003, His Lordship

Marsoof J. in his judgment made the following observations under the sub~heading

"Duty to answer all issues ..... if the answer to a single issue is in effect a complete answer to all the issues

arisingfor determination in this action whether it is necessary and incumbent on the District Judge to

give specific answers to other issues. In this context, it is relevant to note that in terms of section 187 of

the Civil Procedure Code, a judgment should contain a concise statement of the case, pOints for

determination and the decision thereon and the reasons for such decision. As was observed by Court in

Warnakula v. Ramani Jayawardene 1990 1 Sri LR. 206 at page 208, "bare answers to

issues without reasons are not in compliance with the requirements of section 187 of the Civil Procedure

Code". The judge must evaluate and consider the totality of evidence giving short summary of the

evidence of the parties and witnesses and stating the reasons for his preference to accept the evidence of

one party as opposed to that of the other. The learned District Judge in this case has totally failed to

discharge this duty by failing to even attempt answering all of the very material issues raised on behalf

of the Respondents and has also failed to explain why in this view it is not necessary to answer other

very important issues ... ".

.-

Furthermore, in the case of Mohideen and Another v. BOC20011 Sri L.R. 290 at page

299 Hector Yapa J. citing with approval the following dicta of WIjeratna J. in

Muthukrishna v. Gomes and others 1994 3 Sri L.R. at page 8 has observed as follows:

" ...... Judges of original courts should, as far as practicable, go through the entire trial and

answer all the issues unless they are certain that a pure question of law without the leading

evidence apart from formal evidence can dispose of the case .... "

Upon a careful perusal of the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kurunegala dated

18.10.1999, it is abundantly dear that the said judgment has not been delivered in due

compliance with the requirements of Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, and that

the learned trial Judge has failed in his duty to answer all the issues raised in the case

but instead provided a collective affirmative answer to the issues of the Plaintiff, and an

all embraCing negative answer to the issues of the Defendant without having evaluated

each and every issue. Thus the judgment is vitiated by its non~compliance with

imperative requirements being followed.

Let me advert now to what the State Counsel said was the inhibiting factor in the way

of a settlement namely the imposition of fine.

Issue No.26

The learned State Counsel has called in question the answer to Issue No. 26 raised by

the Plaintiff, which purports to deal with the relief pertaining to the cost of litigation

and any other relief that the Court may deem fit to grant. The contention of the State

Counsel is that the imposition of cost on the state has been mechanically made, as issue

No 26 along with all other issues has not been answered in the judgment dated

18.10.1999 in due compliance with the requirements of Section 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code. I cannot help but agree with that contention. If a financial burden is

imposed on a Defendant, there must be a legal basis and there is nothing that has been

mentioned by way of a rationale for this imposition of such cost on the state.

A careful scrutiny of Issue No.26 will bear out that the said issue is so broadly couched

that it would operate as an all~inclusive and omnibus last issue. In my view the over

7

breath of this issue cannot include a plea for a cost of litigation which in my view

should be a specific issue. This reasoning is consistent with the fact that the cost of

litigation has been prayed for by the PlaintifrRespondent in the prayer to the plaint

filed in the District Court of Kurunegala. Therefore a specific issue should have been

raised on cost of litigation and tried. Evidence should have been placed before the

learned District Judge and a specific answer to that issue should have been elicited.

Therefore I hold that in the absence of a specific issue raised and/or framed by the

Plaintiff pertaining to the relief of cost of litigation as prayed for in the plaint, the

Plaintiff would not be entitled to claim any cost of litigation as a relief against the

Appellant. If there was no specific issue raised in respect of cost of litigation, the

learned District Judge cannot make use of an omnibus issue to engulf it and award it as

a relief. This situation is reminiscent of the converse of what happened in the case of

Surangi v. Rodrigo (2003) 3 Sri LR. 35. In that case there was an issue that was

attempted to be raised on the question of permanent alimony but there was no prayer

for permanent alimony and so Gamini Amaratunga J. decided that the learned District

Judge was quite correct in refusing to allow the Plaintiff to frame an issue relating to

alimony. The mantra was that there would be no relief if there was no prayer. There

converse must also hold true. In this case there was a prayer for cost of litigation but no

issue was raised and no evidence was led to establish the issue of cost of litigation.

The above two questions of law which are pivotal to the resolution of the issues in this

appeal are also dispositive of the appeal and the judgment pronounced by the learned

District Judge of Kurunegala cannot be permitted to stand as it teems with illegalities

and I thus proceed to set aside the Judgment dated 18.10.1999 of the learned District

Court of Kurunegala and allow the Appeal.
