The PetitionE.:r::; have filed this application seeking an interim injunction in terms

of Article 143 of the Con'~titution.

Article 143 of the Constitution reads as follows:

"The Court of A.ppet:d ~hall have the power to grant and issue injunctions to

prevent any irremediable mischief which might ensue before a party making

;]n aJ:.plication for such injunction could prevent the same by bringing an

action in any Court of First Instance .... /1

The Petitioners are the owners of a land in extent of 3 roods 23.44 perches

situCJted in Delathura. The Petitioners do not have an independent right of way to

their land and have gained access to their land through the adjoining land owned

by the 1st Respondent Wattz:ilil Pradeshiya Sabha. The complaint of the Petitioners

to this Court rel:Jte to the construction by the 1st Respondent of a wall on the said

land belonging to the 1st Respondent, which the Petitioners claim would obstruct

their gate and their access to the main road.

Section 214 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended specifies

that no action shall be instituted against any Pradeshi'la Sabha for anything done

or intended to be done under the powers conferred by the said Act, until tl'"",e

Expiration of one month next after notice in writing shall have been given to the

Pr()deshiya Sabha.

It is in this factual background that the Petitioners are seeking an injunction in

terms of Article 143 of the Constitution to restrain the Respondents from

obstructing the right of way of the Petitiof lers, until such time it files action in a

cOlnpetent court upon the expiry of a period of one month from the date of the

notice issued in terms of Section 214.

This Court is of the view that the power vested in it by Article 143 of the

Constitu-Uon can only be exercised to prevent any irremediable mischief, before a

party mJking an application for such injunction could prevent the same by

bringing an action in any Court of First Instance.

The Petiti0ners have admitted th()t the contractor employed by the 1st

Respondent h()s already constructed the boundary wall obstructing the gate of

the Petitioners. The Petitioners have further admitted that the construction of the

boundary wall has been completed and that the Petitioners have already been

obstructed from gaining access to their land.

Thus, the "irremediablemischief" that the Petitioners are seeking to prevent by

seeking an injunction from this Court has already taken place. No useful purpose

would be achieved and no benefit would accrue to the Petitioners by this Court

granting the injunction prJyed for. Thus, it would be futile for this Court to is~ue

the injunction at this stage.

A p(~rty invoking the jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Article 143 of the

COil.stitution is not entitled to 2 n injunction ()s uf right. When its jurisdiction is

invoked, this Court will h~ve to consider inter alia the merits of the application

before dLciding to exercise the power vested in it in terms of Article 143. The

Petitioners have not satisfied this COl!rt that they are entitled to or is in a position

to prove before a Court of first instance any right of way. The Petitioners have

also fJiled to satisfy this Court that the 1st Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha h(]s no

right to construct a wall on its own land.

The Petitioners have fileu an (.4ddition(J1 affidavit by which they have complained

that the Responcients are erecting structures for a playground. This Court is of the

view that any further development by the Respondents would net affect the

Petitioners as by their own admission, their right of way has already been

ubstructed. Thus, this Court sees no urgency that requires this Court to issue an

injunction.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that this not a fit case in which

the jurisdlctio!l conferred on this Ccurt by Article 143 of the Constitution shoulu

be exercised. Accordingly, this Court decides to refuse this application and

dismisses this application, without costs.
