By this application, the Petitioner has sought a mandate in the nature of writ

of Certiorari to quash a decision of vacation of post and preventing the Petitioner

from entering the precincts of the 1 st Respondent Institution, by the 2nd

Respondent, as reflected in document marked P 11, andlor P 20.

The Petitioner held the post of Secretaryl Director of the Sri Lanka Council

for Agricultural Research. By application dated 09/12/2015, marked P7a, the

Petitioner has applied for overseas leave from 15th to 20th December 2015. The 2nd

Respondent by letter dated 1111212015, marked P7b, has forwarded the said

application to the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture for approval. By letter dated

14112/2015, marked P 18, the Petitioners application for overseas leave has been

refused.

.

The Petitioner states that by letter dated 11112/2015, marked P8, the 2nd

Respondent had confirmed that the leave out of Sri Lanka has been duly approved.

Furthermore, the Petitioner submits that despite the said approval he informed the

2nd and 3rd Respondents via telemail marked P 9a, P 9b, and P 9c, that to his

knowledge leave sought to be out of the country had been approved and therefore,

he would report back for duty on 21/1212015.

By letter dated 16/12/2015, marked PlO, the 2nd Respondent has informed

the Petitioner that he has failed to report to work on 15th December 2015, and

requested the Petitioner to report to work forthwith. Since the Petitioner failed to

comply with the said direction, by the impugned letter dated 18/12/2015, marked

Pll, the Petitioner was notified that he has vacated post. By letter dated

22/12/2015, marked P12, the Petitioner admits that he reported for duty on

2111212015.

In paragraph 11, of the affidavit filed of record the Petitioner admits that

the leave application submitted to the 2nd Respondent was pending approval of the

relevant authority as required by law. However, the Petitioner relies on documents

marked P9a to P9c, in support of absence without leave for the period 15th

December 2015 to 20th December 2015, to challenge the impugned decision as

reflected in documents marked Pll and P20. The Petitioners stand is that the letter

given by the 2nd Respondent marked P8, to facilitate his visa application is

sufficient proof of approval of leave for the relevant period.

4

The Petitioners departure from Sri Lanka on overseas leave from the 15th to

the 20th December 2015, was prior to the approval of his leave application marked

P 7a, by the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, who is the authority to grant or

refuse leave to the Petitioner. This is indicative by letter dated 14/12/2015, marked

P18. Document marked P8, has been issued to the Petitioner by the Director of the

Sri Lanka Council for Agriculture Research Policy, where the Petitioner served as

the Secretary, has no authority to grant leave to the Petitioner. Therefore,

document marked P8, issued to the visa officer of the relevant embassy with

reference to grant of leave has no validity and cannot in any way construe the

grant of overseas leave by the relevant authority.

In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish any

legal basis to challenge, vacation of post as contained in documents marked P 11

and P20, and therefore, the reliefs prayed for is denied.

Petition is dismissed without costs.

P. Padman Surasena, J. (PICA)

I agree.
