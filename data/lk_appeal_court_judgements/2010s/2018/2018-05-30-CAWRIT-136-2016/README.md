Judgment on 24/05/2018

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

Sandya Chamari Vithana, the 2nd Petitioner, states that her daughter, Risini

Ranulya Iduwaree Thennahewa, (1 st Petitioner) was unlawfully, unreasonably and

in contravention to circular marked P4, was prevented admission to Grade 1 of

Dharmashoka College Ambalangoda (herein after sometimes referred to as the

"said college") by the 1 st to 9th and 16th to 19th Respondents, who were members of

the Interview Board and the Appeals and Objections Inquiry Board for admission

to Grade 1 of the said college. The 2nd Petitioner further state that in the said

process, the 10th, 11th and 1ih Respondents, (applicants) who were not qualified,

were admitted to Grade 1 in an arbitrary and capricious manner and therefore the

said Respondents failed to exercise powers vested by virtue of clause 6.5 of the

circular to the Appeals and Objections Board marked P4, and accordingly, the

Petitioners are seeking, inter alia, a mandate in the nature of writ of Certiorari and

a writ of Mandamus to quash the decision refusing admission and to grant the 1 st

Petitioner admission to Grade 1 of the said college. The Petitioners have also

prayed for writ of Certiorari to quash the decision by the said Respondents to

admit the 10th, 11th and 12th Respondents to Grade 1 of the said college.

6

At the conclusion of the oral submissions, respective parties undertook to

file written submissions in the registry by 02/02/2018. However, the Petitioners

have failed to submit their written submissions as per the said undertaking.

The 2nd Petitioner submits that, consequent to an application submitted

under the transfer category for Grade 1 admission to the said college, marked P6,

the 1 st Petitioner was called for an interview by letter dated 17/9/2015, marked P7.

The Petitioners do not dispute the evaluation of the said application by the

respective Respondents. However, the Petitioners have submitted specific

objections for Admitting Applicant No. TR 22, 1. U. Heellage (represented by the

10th Respondent) Applicant No. TR. 09 A.H.N.P. De Silva, (represented by the

11 th Respondent) and applicant No. TR 46, M.D. Roshan (represented by the Ith

Respondent), in the list of admissions to Grade 1. The 2nd Petitioner contends that

due to improper and fraudulent considerations adopted to admit the said

applicants, the 1 st Petitioner was deprived of admission to the said college and

therefore, challenge the Interview Board for the said irregularities.

The Petitioners object to the admission of applicant No. TR 22, (loth

Respondent) on the following grounds;

(a) The application cannot be considered under the Transfer category as the

transfer was a special appeal transfer which was effected on a request and

not a transfer required by the State.

7

(b) Since the 10th Respondent was transferred to Elpitiya Base Hospital, with

effect from 11112016, there was no attachment to Balapitiya Base Hospital

at the relevant time.

Petitioners submit that the 10th Respondent was transferred from the

Narahenpita Military Hospital to the Balapitiya Base Hospital on a request made

by him by letter dated 15/7/2010, marked P12. The Petitioners also refer to P13,

and state that the 10th Respondent misrepresented facts to the Interview Board by

falsely claiming that on 11112015, he was working at the Balapitiya Base Hospital,

when in fact, he was transferred to Elpitiya Base Hospital and had assumed duties

at the said hospital by 30112/2014.

The Petitioners object to the admission of applicant No. TR 09, (11 th

Respondent) on the following ground;

"that the said applicant misled the Interview Board by producing a Grama

Niladhri Certificate in proof of his residence in Matale, when in fact, his

former place of employment was Negambo. "

The Petitioners object to the admission of applicant No. TR 46, (13 th

Respondent) stating that;

"the said Respondent misled the Interview Board to falsely believe that the

said Respondent's residence was closer to Dharmashoka College

Ambalangoda than to Buddhattha Primary School Ambalangoda. "

8

In response, to the objection raised to applicant No. 22, the DSG submits

that, there is no evidence that the 10th Respondent specifically requested to be

transferred to the Balapitiya Base Hospital.

Document marked P 12, makes it clear that transfers of "Grade" Medical

Officers are given after due consideration to the special appeals, and carried out on

the availability of the requested post at the Base Hospital. Further the "effective

date of transfer is considered as the date on which the officer has reported for duty

in the new station". It is observed that the transfers are effected on special appeals

against a general list of transfers, and therefore the transfer of the 10th Respondent

cannot be considered purely on the basis of a request for transfer made by the said

Respondent.

Accordingly, it is at the discretion of the relevant authorities to consider

special appeals, taking into consideration the vacancies existing for the said post.

The need to consider a request for a transfer would arise only on the availability of

a vacancy in the relevant Base Hospital and its requirements to fill such vacancy.

Accordingly, one cannot consider a request for transfer by a Medical Officer in

isolation, but necessarily to be considered with the requirement of the relevant

Base Hospital. Therefore a special appeal, has to be considered on the requirement

of the Base Hospital before the relevant appointment is made.

It is observed that at the time of evaluating the application submitted by the

10th Respondent, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 28112/2015, marked lR7, has

9

called for observations from the Secretary, Ministry of Health, where it was

confirmed by letter dated 6/3/2016, marked lR8, that the transfer of the 10th

Respondent was made on service exigency. Therefore it is clear that the 10th

Respondent was transferred due to the requirement of the relevant Base Hospital.

According to document marked lRl, the 10th Respondent was transferred

as an anesthetist to the Balapitiya Base Hospital with effect from 112/2011, and

thereafter was transferred to Elpitiya Base Hospital with effect from 11112015.

However as reflected in document marked 1 R2, the 10th Respondent was working

at the Balapitiya Base Hospital as at 19/6/2015.

It is submitted by the Respondents that the procedure in relation to the

transfer of Medical Officers is at the date of discharge from the previous

attachment as Medical Officer. The transfer from Balapitiya Base Hospital to

Elpitiya Base Hospital was effective from 11112015 (P13). However, the 10th

Respondent was attached to Balapitiya Base Hospital as at 19/6/2015, as indicated

by document marked lR2. The last date to submit applications for Grade 1 of the

said college was 1017/2015. Therefore it is observed that as contained in document

marked P12, the "effective date of transfer will be considered as the date on which

the officer has reported for duty in the new station".

Therefore the Petitioners contention that the 10th Respondent falsely

misrepresented facts relating to his transfer to the Interview Board by stating that

he assumed duties at the Balapitiya Base Hospital on or about the 30th December

10

2015, does not hold ground. It is also observed that, after due consideration of

relevant facts, the Appeals Objections Board has evaluated marks given to the 10th

Respondent (applicant) on priority of residence over applicant Gurusinghe (TR42)

and applicant W.A. Lakmal (TR35).

The Petitioners objection to applicant A.H.N.P. De Silva (TR09), is on the

basis that the said applicant fraudulently misrepresented facts to the Interview

Board by stating that he resides in Matale, when in fact his former place of

employment was Negambo. (paragraph 32 of the Petition) However, it is observed

that in application No.TR 09 marked lRll, there is no material to substantiate the

claim that the said applicants former place of employment was Negambo. In

terms of clause 5 (v) of letter dated 17/09/2015, marked P7, an application made

under the transfer category is required to produce documents to the satisfaction of

the Interview Board, regarding the applicants previous place of service.

The Petitioners objection is that the said applicant was not living in the area

of his place of service. The Grama Sevaka Certificate marked lR9, dated

25/09/2015, states that the applicant has lived in Matale in the given address, prior

to 01104/2015. The letter of transfer marked lRIO, shows that, the applicant has

commenced work at the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management

Department office at Balapitiya-Karandeniya on 12/05/2014. Together with the

application No TR 09, dated 20106/2015, the applicant has also submitted, Lease

, .---. 11

Agreement No. 3568, dated 21/02/2015, marked lR12, as proof of residence as

declared.

The Petitioners objection to the selection of applicant No. TR 46, is on the

basis that, the said applicant has been given the maximum marks in the category of

close proximity to the school, when Buddhadhttha Primary School is in closer

proximity to the applicant's residence. In support, the Petitioners have submitted

two maps marked P20 and P21, and has compared the distance between the said

schools, in which Buddhadhttha Primary School, with a distance of 496.17m is in

closer proximity to the residence of the applicant. However, on the Google map

marked IRIS, the school in closer proximity to the residence of the said applicant

is Dharmashoka College. Therefore, the said applicant has satisfied the criteria of

residence and the appropriate marks had been given.

When the Petitioners raised the aforesaid objections, the 2nd Petitioner was

called for an interview and was heard by the Appeals Objections Board. The 2nd

Petitioner submits that, the evaluation of her application by the respective Inquiry

Boards are not in dispute. However, the 2nd Petitioner complains that the said

Boards of inquiry failed to correctly evaluate critical documentation before the

selections were made and therefore the marks allocated to the respective

applicants are erroneous.

As noted above, the Petitioners have not been denied of the opportunity of

having their objections in the matter considered. The Petitioners have failed to

12

produce any material to substantiate their legal entitlement to meet the criteria for

admission on the basis that incorrect information or fraudulently prepared

documentation were considered in the process of evaluation of the said

applications. The Petitioners have also failed to disclose any procedural

irregularity in the process of selection of the challenged applicants. It is observed

that the Respondents have produced to court the documents relied upon to counter

the objections raised by the Petitioners, which the Petitioners were not privy to at

the time of evaluation of their objections by the Appeal Objections Board.

After due consideration of the disclosed documents relied upon by the

relevant Inquiry Board, I am of the view that the Petitioners application was

sufficiently considered and a proper determination has been made according to

circular marked P4, and I do not see any illegality or impropriety on the part of the

said Board in deciding in favour of the 11th, 12th and 13th Respondents for

admission to Grade 1 of the said College.

Therefore the Petitioners application is dismissed without costs.
