IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE DEMOCRAIC SOCIALIST

REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA.

CA Application No. CC/14/20 16

Before : L.T.B. Dehideniya J (PICA)

Shiran Goonarathne J

Decided on : 14/12/2017

L.T.B.Dehideniya L (PICA)

The Petitioner instituted this action under the Article 105 (3) of the

Constitution complaining that the 3 rd Respondent has committed a contempt of

court. The Petitioner's contention is that the 3rd Respondent in case Nos

CAlWritl158/2016 and CAlWritl484/2015 has presented incorrect material to

court and obtained interim relieves. The Petitioner's submission is that presenting

incorrect facts to the Court amounts to contempt of court and he moves that the

3 rd Respondent be punished.

We are of the view that the Attorney General, being the chief prosecutor,

should be heard in this regard. Accordingly we direct the Registrar to issue notice

on the Attorney General to appear as Amicus Curie and to express his opinion.
