(Section 2<'1 (1)).

The 1 5t Petitioner contends that, the application for registration of the 2nd

Petitioner. in terms of the Amending Act. could be made. within five months of

the date of "commencement" of such Amending Act. which he has (Iaimed to

mean, the 24th April 2013 the date on which the Amending Act was certified by

the Speaker - that is, on or before 24th September 2013; ignoring the provisions of

Section 1 of the Amending Act, which provides that the Amending Act

shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into operation on

January I. 2013", \\hich is relied on by the Respondents, who contend that,

accordingly, such application should have been made on or before the ::U~Max

2013. (As stated earlier, the date of the said application (marked 'XIO') is L9_lhJl)1),

20Ut

Section 2( e) or the Interpretation Ordinance provides that -

"2. In this Ordinance and in every written law, whether made before or after

the commencement of this Ordinance, unless there be something repugnant in the

subject or context

(e) "commencement" . "used with reference to an enactment. shall mean the

day on which such enactment comes into force; and "operation", Llsed with

reference to an enactment which is not to take effect immediately upon coming

into force, shall mean the dav on which such enactment takes effect".

Dealing with "Legislati\e Power", Ihe Constitution of tlh: i)CIllUlT,ttic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (1978) ("the Constitution"), provides in Article 75

that, "Parliament shall have power to make laws, including laws having

retrospective effect and repealing or amending any provision of the Constitution or

adding any provision to the Constitution:

Provided that",," (relating to the suspension or rcpeal of the Constitution,

which is not relevant in this instance),

Article 80 (I) of the Constitution prm'idcs, inter alia, that "Subject to the

provIsions of paragraph (2) of this Article. a Bill passed by Parliament shaJl

become law when the certificate of the Speaker is endorsed thereon," (Sub

paragraph 2 relates to a Bill requiring a referendum and is not relevant in this

instance.)

In relation to "Retrospective Operation of Statutes", Maxwell on "The

Interpretation of Statutes", Twel11h Edition by P. St. J. Langon states. at page 215,

that

"Upon the presumption that the legislature does nor intend what is

unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retro.speclive

operation. They are construed as operating only in cases or on /Cl(:ts which

come into existence ujier the statutes were passed unless a retrospective

effect is clearl1' inlended It is a /imdwnental rule of I~nglish ruw that 110

statute shalf be construed TO have a retrospective operatioll 1117/ess slIch a

construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by

necessary one/ dis/inc! implication ". This passage has been cited. with

approval, in Sivarlijasingllllm Vs Sivllsuhramaniam (1978-79-80) 1 SLR

327 at page 330.

Also, as pointed out earlier, Section 1 of the Amending Act provides. inter

alia. that such Act. ....... shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into

operation on January 1'[ 2013."

The Supreme Court has considered the effect of a "deeming provision" in a

statute. in the case of ,Jinawathie and others vs. Emalin Perera (1986) 2 SLR

121, and has stated. (at page 130). inter alia, as follo'ws-

"in statutes the expression "deemed" is commonly used for

the purpose of creating a statutory fiction so that the meaning of a

term is extended to a subject matter which it properZv does not

designate. 7hlls )rh('r(' (/ person is "deemed to be somethin?, " it (mil'

meuns that Yl'!zcreos he' is 110t in reo/i!y that something the :lel of

Parliament requires him to be treated as if he were. When a thing is

deemed to be something, it does not mean that it is that which il is

deemed to be, but it is rather an admission that it is not whol it is

deemed (0 be, and That notwithstanding it is not that particular thing

it is nevertheless deemed to be that thing. Where a statute declares

that a person or thing shall be deemed to be or shall be trealed as

I I i

I l I I j

j i I I I I

something which in reality it is not, it shall have to be treated (IS so

during the ell/ire COllI'S!! of the proceeding -vide /Jllltiru'

Interpretation oj},'tallll!!S (6/h Ed.) pp. <)12-914. "

Further. relating to the "Language of Legislation". Article 23 of the

Constitution. repealed and substituted by the Sixteenth Amendment tu the

constitution (certitied on the 17th December. 1988) provides, inter alia. as

follows -

'"23.( 1) All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made

and published in Sinhala and 'I ami!. together with a translation th(:rL'Oj' in

English:

Provided that Parliament shalL at the stage of enactment of any law

determin(: which text shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency

between texts.

Provided further (not relevant in this instance)".

Accordingly. th(: Fnglish text or the Amending Act IS onh a

translation thereof.

Section 7 of the Amending Ad provides that, "in the event uJ' ,1m

inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of this Act, the Sinhala

text shall prevail."

Therefore, it is the Sinhala text of the Amending Act, which should

be considered when interpreting the prmisions of the Amending Act. 1111:

Sinhala text of Sections I and 2A (1), which has been quoted earlier.

contains the word "~C5:JclZ5) eJ@@ ~~C5", in both such Sections 1 and

2A( 1).

Thus, it is clear that the date, on or before which the 1 sl Petitioner should

have made the application (marked "XI0"), in terms of the Amending Act. was

within live months or 1 sl January 2013, that is, on or before the 31 st May 2013,

whereas the lSI Petitioner's application \vas. (IS stated earlier. dated 19111 .luly 2013,

which is outside the time permitted by such l\mending Act.

There was also a dispute between the parties as to the date on which the

said application (marked .. x 1 0") was received by the 1st Respondent the 1 sl

Petitioner claiming that slIch application was submitted "by hand", 011 the date or

the application itselL that is, 191h July 2013. (paragraph 13 of the said Petition

dated 3rd July 2014); while, the Statement of Objections dated 14th October 2014

of the I SI and 211(1 Respondents claims that such application (marked "X 1 0") \\"as

received on the 2nd August 2013 (paragraphs 6 and 10 of the said Statement or

Objections). However, in view of this Judgment. it is immaterial vvhether the said

application (marked "XI0") was received by the 1st Respondent on the 19th July

2013 or on the 2nd August 2013.

Also, the I st Petitioner has stated that ""he had invested over Rs.I 00 million

for his new building and, the entire investment will go waste if the I ,( respondents

decision continued to prevail "(paragraph 19 of the said Petition dated 3rt! July

2014). In the case or The Chairman, Urban Council, Matara Vs. Abcvsuriva 52 . .

NLR 349, "The accused erected a new building within a limit of twcllty live feet

from the centre of a road, in contravention of the provisions of section 87 or the

Urban Councils Ordinance No.31 of 1939 and section 13 (l) of the I-lousing and

Town Improvement Ordinance. The chairman of the Urban Council was not

agreeable to granting any concession to the accused in regard to the demolition of

the building'", the Supreme Could held .. that the Court was bound to issue a

mandatory order under section 13(2) of the Housing and Town Improvement

Ordinance for the demolition urthe building. It is not open to a Court to take upon

itself the task of permitting a breach of an enactment on grounds that an accLlsed

person would suffer hardship or loss".

In the circumstances, the Petitioners application for the reliefs prayed for is

refused, without costs.
