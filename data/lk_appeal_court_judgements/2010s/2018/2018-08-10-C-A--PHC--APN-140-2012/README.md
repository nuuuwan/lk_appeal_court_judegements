This is a revision application against the order of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

(Admiralty Court) dated 08.08.2012.

The question of law that arises for determination in this case is what is the applicable exchange

rate in satisfying a judgement entered in foreign currency in Sri Lanka. The learned High Court

Judge decided that it is the rate of conversion as at the date of payment which is the position

urged by the Plaintiffs-Respondents (Respondents). The Defendant-Petitioner (Petitioner) on

the other hand relying on Mercantile Agency v. Ismail (26 N.L.R. 326) contends that the rate of

conversion should be the applicable exchange rate as at the date of breach or date of judgment

and hence this revision application.

Let me at the outset consider the possible dates at which the conversion may be done and

consider the advantages and disadvantages of each date.

The general principle is that the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of action

[Silva v. Fernando et al (15 N.L.R. 499)]. However, certain exceptions are said to exist to this

general principle [Thangavadivel v. Inthiravathy (53 N.L.R. 369)]. However, in Miliangos v. George

Frank (Textiles) Ltd. [1976 A.C. 443], Lord Wilberforce rejects using the date on which the action

is brought as the date for conversion since these dates still leave the judgment creditor at a

significant currency risk. According to Lord Wilberforce adopting the date on which the action is

brought as the appropriate date for conversion leaves the judgment creditor at the mercy of the

debtor's obstructive tactics and the law's delays (at page 469).

The next option is the date of breach. Support for this date appears to be based more on an

English law perspective. In Re United Railways of the Havana and RegIa Warehouses Ltd [(1960)

2 All. E. R. 332] one of the strongest reasons cited for continuing with the breach date rule was

that it sustained uniformity in the English legal system. Lord Viscount Simonds in this case stated

that it would be unrefined to have different rules as to the date of conversion depending on

whether the claim is for a breach of contract, in tort or for a debt.

Page 4 of 12

In Miliangos, Lord Wilberforce referred to currency stability and stated that floating currencies

have become the norm and fixed currencies the exception (at page 463). In such a context, the

breach date rule was held to be unsatisfactory because that rule was posited on a currency

system that was fixed. For instance, during the period the breach date rule was in existence it

was highly unnatural for the relative value of currency to change rapidly between the 'breach

date', date of judgment or 'date of payment'.

Therefore, even a creditor who recovered the sterling equivalent converted as at the date of

breach did not suffer a huge loss. However, in a context where world currencies are 'floating' this

will not be the case and rapid changes in the relative value of currency is the norm. For instance,

if the foreign currency in which judgment is sought appreciates between the date of breach and

the date of payment, the judgment creditor will be able to obtain a greater amount of sterling

based on prevailing exchange rates.

However, since the breach date rule requires him to rely on the past exchange rate he will recover

less than he is entitled to. This can be problematic especially in situations where the legal system

is slow moving and the judgment debtor has the necessary tools to drag on and delay the

litigation process.

Further, Lord Simon of Glaisdale in his dissent in Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd. (supra)

pOinted out that several statutory enactments and rules had been formulated in England on the

basis of the breach date rule and that disturbing the said rule is likely to create dislocations in the

English legal system (at page 487).

However, the breach date rule is inequitable even from a judgment debtor's perspective. For

instance, if the foreign currency in which the claim is made depreciates between the date of

breach and date of payment, requiring the debtor to pay for example the rupee equivalent as at

the date of breach is an imposition of an obligation on him to pay more than he should at

prevailing market prices.

Page 5 of 12

The other option is the date of payment. The main justification for the Miliangos formulation viz.

that a judgment creditor is entitled to judgment in foreign currency or the sterling equivalent as

at the date of payment is that the date of conversion enables the judgment creditor to obtain

exactly what he bargained for and that the judgment creditor is less affected by fluctuations in

the value of the sterling.

Therefore, the possible dates on which the conversion can be made has both positive and

negative elements.

For some time, it was uncertain whether a judgement can be entered in Sri Lanka in foreign

currency. The matter was authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank Ltd. v.

Manchester Yarn and Thread (Pvt) Ltd. [(2004) 3 Sri. L. R. 303] where it was held that judgements

can be given in foreign currencies in Sri Lanka.

The parties contend that there is a dispute on what is the applicable exchange rate in satisfying

a judgement entered in foreign currency in Sri Lanka and rely on several English authorities to

support the position taken by each of them. The relevance of these authorities can be discerned

only after a proper characterization of the issue.

What I mean by "characterization" or "classification" is the allocation of the question raised by

the factual situation before the Court to its correct legal category. Is the question before Court a

substantive one or procedural one and if it is substantive to what sub-category, such as contract,

tort etc. does it fall into? It is only after such an analysis can a court determine what is the law

applicable given that although Roman-Dutch Law is the common law of Sri Lanka, English law is

also at times relevant in our legal system.

Page 6 of 12

I am of the view that the question before this court is one dealing with procedure. I come to this

conclusion after considering the definition given to tithe law of procedure" by Lush U in Poyser v.

Minors [(1881) 7 Q.B.D. 329 at 333] and adopted in Re an intended action, Shoesmith vs.

Lancaster Mental Hospital Board [(1938) 3 AII.E.R. 186] which reads:

tiThe mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced, as distinguished from the law

which gives or defines the right, and which by means of the proceeding the court is to

administer the machinery as distinguished from its product".

There is a clear line of authority which holds that section 2 of the Civil Law Ordinance did not

introduce English rules of procedure to Sri Lanka. [Mudalihamy v. Punchi Banda (15 N.L.R. 350);

Suppiaya Reddiar v. Mohammed (39 N.L.R. 459); Oretra Enterprises and others v. Wijeykoon

(2003) 3 SrLL.R. 1]. In that context, the English authorities cited by parties are of little significance.

However, the case before court was decided by the High Court of Colombo exercising Admiralty

Jurisdiction. Therefore, this court must examine the procedure that governs proceedings before

the Admiralty Court.

In Elarca S. A. of Monrovia, Liberia & Another v. Oi/borne Shipping Co. Inc. of Liberia [(1979) 2 Sri.

L. R. 293 which was approved by the Supreme Court in (1978-79-80) 2 Sri.L.R. 55] a divisional

bench of this court extensively surveyed the history of admiralty proceedings in the country.

Among the courts observations was that historically admiralty proceedings in Ceylon/Sri Lanka

had not been governed by the procedure applicable to civil cases but always had a sui generis

procedural regime of its own. In coming to this conclusion, the court referred to the fact that

admiralty proceedings under the Ceylon (Courts of Admiralty) Ordinance had been governed by

procedural rules made in terms of section 23 of that Ordinance viz. the Vice Admiralty Rules.

After the coming into force of the Administration of Justice Law, although the admiralty

jurisdiction was transferred to the High Court, the Vice Admiralty Rules governing procedure

were kept alive by section 3(2) of the Administration of Justice Law.

Page 7 of 12

The court also concluded that the Admiralty Courts did not fall within the scope of the term 'civil

court' in the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). The reasoning of the court was based on the position

that a 'civil court' would be regulated by the procedures of the CPC, but that the Admiralty Courts

were governed by an equally extensive procedural regime reflected in the Vice Admiralty Rules.

The reasoning of the court namely that courts exercising admiralty jurisdiction are governed by

a sui generis procedural regime is the correct position even after the enactment of the Judicature

Act No.2 of 1978. In Mohamed Saleh Bawazir v. "M. V. Ayesha" EX M. V. Lying in the Port of

Colombo and Seyda Mansoor Ullslam, Acting Minister [(1986) 1 Sri L. R. 314] the Court of Appeal

concluded that the Vice Admiralty Rules of 1883 were kept alive by section 3 (2) of the

Administration of Justice Law (which was not repealed by the Judicature Act) read with Articles

169 (6) and 168 (1) of the Constitution.

Section 11(3) of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act No. 40 of 1983 (Admiralty Jurisdiction Act) reads:

"Rules may be made under Article 136 of the Constitution regulating the practice and

procedure of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act."

Accordingly, the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Rules of 1991 published in Government

Gazette No 672/7 dated 24.07.1991 is the present sui generis procedural regime governing

admiralty jurisdiction in the country. However, these rules do not provide for an answer as to

what is the applicable exchange rate in satisfying a judgement entered in foreign currency in Sri

Lanka.

The question then is what is the procedural rules which must be considered by this court in

determining this issue.

Section 12 of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act reads:

"Where in any proceedings instituted under this Act, any matter or question of

procedure arises in respect of which no provision or adequate provision has been made

by or under this Act or any other enactment or any rule, the Court shall have power to

make such orders and to give such directions which the Court exercising admiralty

Page 8 of 12

jurisdiction in England would have the power to make and give in like circumstances in

so far as such orders and directions shall not conflict or be inconsistent with any

provisions made by or under this Act or any other enactment or any rule." (emphasis

added)

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the legal position if the same issue arose before the modern-

day admiralty courts of England.

The learned President's Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the rule stated in Miliangos

v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd. (supra) has been continuously followed by the Admiralty Courts of

England in The "Halcyon Skies" (No.2) [(1977) 1 Lloyds Rep. 22], The "Transoceanica Franceska"

and "Nicos V" [(1987) 2 Lloyds Rep. 155] and Smit Tak International Zeesleepen Bergingsbedriff

B. V. v. Selco Salvage Ltd. and others [(1988) 2 Lloyds Rep. 398] and therefore should be followed

by the Admiralty Court.

Neither the Supreme Court Act of 1981 which vests admiralty jurisdiction in the UK High Court

(section 20 - 24), Part 61 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules1 which deal with Admiralty claims or

Practice Direction 612 which supplements Part 61 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules deal with the

question/matter of whether the UK admiralty courts are empowered to make foreign currency

orders in relation to claims over which it exercises jurisdiction. Practice Direction 61 states that

admiralty claims in personam will proceed in accordance with Part 58 of the UK Civil Procedure

Code. However, neither Part 58 of the UK Civil Procedure Code3 or Practice Direction 584

supplementing it deals with foreign currency orders.

However, Part 40 of the UK Civil Procedure Ruless which deals with judgments, orders, sale of

lands and Practice Direction 4096 which supplements that part is instructive in this respect. Part

40 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules is described as a section which:

" .... sets out rules about judgments and orders which apply except where any other of these

Rules or a practice direction makes a different provision in relation to the judgment or

order in question."7

Since the UK Civil Procedure Rules apply to courts including the High Court exercising admiralty

jurisdiction8 the procedural rules governing judgments and orders in Part 40 and the

supplementary Practice Direction 409 would be applicable to the UK Admiralty Courts. Practice

Direction 409 supplementing Part 40 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules recognizes the capacity for

civil courts9 to give judgments for an amount in foreign currency or their sterling equivalent at

the time of payment.10

This analysis results in the applicable exchange rate in satisfying a judgement entered in foreign

currency in Sri Lanka to be the rupee equivalent at the time of payment.

In M. V. "Ocean EnvoyN and another v. AI-Linshirah Bulk Carriers Ltd. [(2002) 2 Sri.L.R. 337] the

Court of Appeal held that Section 12 of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act provides that where there

is no provision or inadequate provision in the said Act, the Admiralty Court shall have the power

to make such order/ directions which the court exercising admiralty jurisdiction in England had

power to make and that if the Act is silent and if there is no provision in the Law of England for

de novo trials specially when the trial has been concluded, it is for the Judge of the Admiralty

6 See https:llwww.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part40/pd part40b#10.1

7 UK Civil Procedure Rules, Part 40.1 (See https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part02 )

8 UK Civil Procedure Rules, Part 2.1

9 This includes; (a) the County Court; (b) the High Court; and (c) the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal (See UK Civil Procedure Rules, Part 2.1)

10 UK Civil Procedure Rules, Part 40: Practice Direction 40B: section 10 Where judgment is ordered to be entered in a foreign currency, the order should be in the following form:

It is ordered that the defendant pay the claimant (state the sum in the foreign currency) or the Sterling equivalent at the time of payment.

Page 10 of 12

Court to use his judicial discretion and decide whether an application for a trial de novo should

be allowed or not.

Accordingly, if the Practice Direction 40B supplementing Part 40 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules

referred to above does not apply to the issue before court the Judge of the Admiralty Court can

in view of section 12 of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act use his judicial discretion and decide the

applicable exchange rate in satisfying a judgement entered in foreign currency in Sri lanka. The

learned High Court Judge appears to have done so in the instant case although the order is devoid

of any reasoning as to why he ordered that it is the rate of conversion as at the date of payment.

In this situation, it is useful to consider how the English Courts approach this question. In United

Railways of the Havanna and Regia Warehouses Ltd. (supra) lord Viscount Simonds restated the

old English rule which said that a claim in foreign currency for (a) liquidated debts, (b) damages

for breach of contract or (c) damages for tort must be converted to sterling at the rate prevailing

at the date of breach. He in fact classified the issue as primarily procedural.

However, the House of lords in Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd. (supra) departed from

the rule stated in United Railways of the Havanna and Regia Warehouses Ltd.(supra) and held

that if there was a necessity to convert a judgement given in foreign currency, the conversion

must be at the applicable rate at the date when leave was given to enforce the judgement, which

lord Wilberforce in delivering the leading judgment understood to mean (at page 813) the date

when the court authorizes enforcement of the judgement in terms of sterling pounds.

Thus, different formulas apply depending on whether the Practice Direction 40B supplementing

Part 40 of the UK Civil Procedure Rules referred to above applies or whether the Judge of the

Admiralty Court can use his judicial discretion and decide the applicable exchange rate in view of

section 12 of the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act.

Page 11 of 12

However, this uncertainty is resolved in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Seylan Bank

Ltd. v. Manchester Yarn and Thread (Pvt) Ltd. (supra) where Wigneswaran J. held (at page 313):

"I would therefore hold that the plaintiff in this case is entitled to obtain judgment in a

currency other than Sri Lankan rupees since there is no law which prohibits such a decree

being entered. When entering judgment in a foreign currency it is also necessary that

the rupee value at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment together with

legal interest should also be entered therein." (emphasis added)

That case was not a matter arising from the Admiralty Court. However, the statement in my view

stands to reason as applying the date of payment as the date of conversion enables the judgment

creditor to obtain exactly what he bargained for and the judgment creditor is less affected by

fluctuations in the value of the rupee.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo (Admiralty Court) dated 08.08.2012.

The revision application is dismissed with costs.
