At the end of the trial the learned District Judge delivered his

judgment dated 01.02.1998 in favor of the Plaintiff. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment that the 2nd Defendant appealed to the Court

of Appeal seeking,

Set aside the judgrnent,

That the shares allotted to the 4th and 5th defendants be deleted.

Legal issues.

1. Prescription amonA.co-ownerse.

That the 2nd Defendant (Appellant) states that she is in

possession of building 'C' in Lot 1 of the land and Lot 3 of the

said land for more than ten years and therefore, she has the

prescriptive title on the said building and Lot 3 of the land.

In Corea v. Iseris Appuhamy 15 NLR 65 the Privy Council held

that the possession of a co-owner was in law, the possession of

the other co-owners and thus, not adverse to them. In other

words even if one co-owner's possession or the common

property or part thereof was of a character incompatible with the

title of the other coowners, yet that co-owner possesses the

common property on behalf of all co-owners. It was not possible

for him to put an end to the possession by any secret intention

in his mind.

In Tlllekaratne V. Bastian 21 NLR 12 Bertram C.J referring to

the real effect of the decision in Corea V. Iseris Appuhamy

5

upon the interpretation of the word "adverse" with reference to

cases of co-ownership stated that the word must be interpreted

in the context of three principle of law:

1. Every co-owner has a right to possess and enjoy the whole

property and every part of it so that the possession of one

co-owner in that capacity is in law, the possession of all.

2. Where the circumstances as such that a man's possession

Inay be referabl,= either to an urJa\'\rful act or to a lawful

title, he is pTesumed. t::l possess by virtue of the lawful title.

3. A person who has entered into possession of land in one

capacity is presumed to continue to possess it in the same

capacity.

It is clear that generally a co-owner cannot establish proscriptive

title against other co-owners. Thus 'when a co-owner's possession is

not, at its incepti0!l a.dverse and he claims that it has later become

adverse, thu8 onus is on him to prove that possession has become

adverse.

He must prove not only an intention on his part to possess

adversely, but a nlanife~tLzion of that intention to the other co-owner

against whom be::;ets up his ponsession.

Referring into the present matter that the 2nd Defendant has

failed to establish that she has pos~,~ssed the said Lot 1 and Lot 3

against the other,~o--ov/r-"e!<3 ave:::: conE:klerable period of time.

6

And no evidence was adduced to establish the defendant's case for

prescription.

2. Whether 4th and 5th Defendant are entitled to the shares

allotted to them?

i. Muthu Manika gifted her undivided Y4 share of land to her

daughter R.M. Ran Menika upon deed No. 3268 dated

12.10.1959. (m2.l

4ked HS 45 1 at pg.129)

11. Ran Manika had sold that undivided Y4 share of land to her

brother R.M. Kiri Banda upon deed No. 18632 dated

05.07.1966. (marked as 45 2 at pg.129)

iii. 2nd Defendant claims that Muthu Manika had sold her Y4

share of land to her husband M.A. Kiribanda upon deed No.

6448 dated 02.01.1987. (marked as 6!> 1 at pg.109. But it is

not in the brief)

IV. Considering aforementioned evidence that Muthu Manika

can't transfer her undivided Y4 share of land to M.A.

Kiribanda which was already gifted to her daughter without

life interest.

v. Therefore, M.A. Kiribanda can't claim the right of said Y4

share of Muthu Manika's land.

7

VI. R.M. Kiri Banda died without a will and his widow Ariyawathi

and two daughters namely Ratnawathi and Seelawathie

entitled to the said undivided land 1/8 share each.

Considering the aforementioned evidence it is evident that the

2nd Defendants case has no merit. The appeal is dismissed without

costs.
