Accused - Appellant is present in court produced by prison authorities.

The counsel for the accused - appellant submits that he is contesting the

conviction and submits this is not a case of murder but a case of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of sudden fight and

explains the facts of the case to the court.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. Dileepa Piries who maintains

the highest tradition of the Attorney General's Department and submits

that this is a case which should have been convicted under section 297 of

the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the

basis of sudden fight. Considering the facts of this case submitted by both

counsel, we find that this is the case where two families, that is the family

of the accused and the deceased were involved in a fracas. The two

~

members of the deceased were injured and were taken to the hospital. At

the time the deceased was about to set out to the police station had a

quarrel with the accused party, the accused who was 67 years old and

assaulted the deceased who was 70 years at the time of the incident. It

was brought to the notice that the family members of the accused namely,

the son also received injuries and were hospitalized. It clearly shows that

there was a fight between two parties which was going for some time, on

the day of the incident the accused had assaulted the deceased who almost

of the same matured age 70 and 67. Considering the facts that we are

convinced that this is not a case of murder. Therefore, we vacate the

conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

After carefully considering the facts of the case, we find the accused guilty

for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of sudden

fight. Accordingly, we convict the accused-appellant under section 297 of

the penal code. We heard the submissions of both counsel regarding the

sentence this is the case where the deceased had suffered severe injury on

the head, anybody can easily presume, that the assault was very severe

therefore we do consider severity of the injury and the other circumstances

therefore we impose a sentence of 12 years rigorous imprisonment and a

fine of Rs.5000 / -in default three months in addition to that we

considering the facts of the case we impose Rs.50,000 / -as compensation

in default one year rigorous imprisonment. Compensation to be paid to

the wife of the deceased, if she is not available, it will be paid to the

,I

granddaughter who gave evidence (PW5) Since the accused appellant

was in remand from the time of the conviction, we direct the prison

authority to implement the sentence from the date of the conviction

namely 04.11.2015.
