The indictment was served on 1 st of July 2013 and the Accused-Respondent pleaded

not guilty at the initial 5tClge. On the 18tli November 2013 the Accused-Respondent

withdraw his pleading of not guilty and pleaded guilty on both counts of the

indictment. Accordingly, he vI/as found guilty by the Learned Trial Judge. Thereafter

. the Learned High Court Judge sentenced the Accused-Respondent as stated earlier.

The Learned DSG had filed written submis;ion regrettably which is not much helpful

for us to consider.

The Counsel for the Accused- Respondent filed written submissions justifying the

sentence imposed on the Accused- Respondent.

It is mandatory to see the legal prov:s:ons stipulated in Section 364(B)(2)(b) of the

Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

"Commits grave sexual abuse on any person under eighteen years of age shall

be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than seven years

and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay

compensation of 0:7 amount determined by court to the person in respect of

whom the oflence W':lS committed for the injuries caused to such person. "

The Counsels for the Accused-Respondent in the Original Court as well as in the

Appellate Court relies on SC Reference 03/2008 (HC Anuradhapura No.333/2004),

SC Appeal 179/2012 and 5C Appeal 17/2013 and submits that the Court is not bound

by the minimum sentence set out in the Penal Code.

In SC Reference 03J2008(HC Ai1lir~dhapura No.333/2004), the Accused was a boy

of around 15 years of aqe, and the victim on whom the statutory rape had been

committed, was also undtt" 16 years at the time of the incident.

In the case of Dharma Sri Tissa J'umara Wijenaike Vs. Attorney General (SC.

Appeal No. 179/2012- ,ninui'es of 78.71.2073) with reference to the SC Reference

03/2008 case, the facts revealed that, the victim was a girl of 13 years at the time of

the rape was committed. The Accused- Appe:iant a 28 year old male, was the driver

for the head priest of the temple, justice Tilakawardane commented that,

IIthis court ratifies the principle that in such cases, where the Accused is under

76 years of age, the sentencing 1;1,,'ould depend on the facts and the

circumstances of each case and if the age of the Accused was 76 years or under,

their age wouLd be a materiaL and relevant fact. This however in the eyes of this

Court, wouLd only apply in cases where the Accused is under the age of

16 ..

liThe decision appears to be based on the reality that the Court is the upper

guardian of Q child".

(Reproduced as it is)

This Court also mindful of the decision in Attorney General vs Ambagala

Mudiyanselage Samantha (SC Appeal No. 17/2013) which affirms the decision in

SC Appeal 179/2012.

It will be appropriate to refer the Supreme Court judgment delivered on under the

case no. SC Appeal 17/20E d 3ted 12th March 2015. That was an appeal by the

appellant arising out of CA 297/2008 and High CO'-lrt of Kurunegala 259/2006.

According to the said judgment, the facts of the case described as follows.

liThe Appellant, Q labourer in occupation had married the victim's sister. They

had no chiLdren in that morria;;e. The vi'.:tim's sister had Left the country without

the consent ol the husband about a year after the marriage. The Appellant was

then invited hy th~ victim's porents ie his mother in law and father in law, to

come and [i'le with them In thEir house. The victim was a 75 year old girl

CA251/2013 JUD.:iI\L:NT Page 40f13

attending school. Only four of them lived in that house. The girl was found to

be pregnant when her mother too,'( her to the hospital when she was unwell.

Then the pregnancy was 5 months old. The parents stopped her going to school;

told the Appellant not to come home again; took her to another village and kept

her there, with an older married couple who had no children, having in mind to

hand over the baoy to them when it is born. The parents did not go to the

Police. The victim girl did not make any complaint to the Police.

Most unexpectedly some outsider had informed the Police of the area that the

Appellant and the victim were mysteriously missing from that house. It is only

then that the Police had launched an investigation and found that the girl was

away in another hcuse whereas the Appellant was living with his parents in his

village closed by. The statement made to the Police revealed that the girl was

only 75 year oLd, and then the Appel/ant was taken into custody and was later

enlarged on bail.

The victim gave birth to a baby girl on 19/07/2007 in the Kuliyapitiya Base

Hospital. It is the Appellant who informed the Registrar of Births of the area that

the baby girl was born, according to her birth Certificate filed of record. It is

mentioned therein that the father of the baby is the Appellant A.M. Samantha

Sampath and that the parents were not legally married. It is accepted that at the

time of her birth, the baby girl Sanduni Wasana had a father, the Appellant and

a mother, the victim.

The Attorney General forwarded an indictment to the High Court dated

04/08/2006. It was taken up for '-"rial on 28/70/2008 for the first time. The

Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of rape of a girl below 16 years and he

was subject to punishment by the High Court under Section 364(2)(e) of the

Penal Code as amended ty Act 1"10.22 of 7995. The baby Sanduni Wason a is

being paid mainte,-!ance by the Appellant and moreover he visits the school as

the father of the child when called upon to do so; has arranged the

CA 251/2013 JUDGI\,!':NT ,Page 5 of 13

transportation to and from the school and sends money to maintain the child.

The High Court imposed a punishment of 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment

suspended for 70 years and imposed a fine and compensation. "

Further the Supreme Court has observed as follows.

"In the present ease, we must look at the big picture with the victim of rape the

Appellant, the father of the child born, and the 70 year old child who was born

into this world as a result of the victim having been raped. The victim of rape

never complained to the Police until after a pregnancy of 5 months when Police

on its own came to the victim in search of her when an outsider informed the

Police of her missing from the home. There was no chance for the victim to give

evidence as the Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of statutory rape of the

victim. There is a bar for the victim and the Appellant enter into a marriage as

the Appellant is already legally married to the victim's sister who is living

abroad. The child is been looked after by the Appellant father in the eyes of the

society, and the child is depend on the income earned by the Appellant."

Considering facts of the case we are not embarking to do a research on the

applicability of the sentence and decided cases.

Considering the facts of this case and the sentence we would like to consider the

appropriateness of the sentence.

A judge who imposes a sentence has a greater duty in balancing between society

and the convict.

Jayant Patel J, in case of Jusabbhai vs State (CR.MA/623/2012) stated that, "it is

now recognized principles that justice to one party should not result into injustice to

CA251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 60f13

the other side and it will ce for the Court to balance the right of both the sides and to

uphold the law .... 1/

According to Republic of Fiji laws 2009, sentencing and penalties decree guidelines

described as follows.

The only purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court are _

(a) to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the

circumstances;

(b) to protect the community from offenders;

(c) to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same

or similar nature,'

(d) to establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be

promoted or facilitated;

(e) to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of

such offences; or

(f) any combination of these purposes.

(2) In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to _

(a) the maximufY) penalty prescribed for the offence;

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline

judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

CA251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7of13

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss

or damage resulting from the offence;

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in

the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to

do so;

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or

the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or

damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply

with any order for restitution that 0 court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concermng the

offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the

offence,' and

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for appLying a

particuLar sentencing option.

Handbook Of International Standards On Sentencing Procedure, published by

the American Bar Association stated that (page 8),

"In the United States, the factors to be considered when imposing a sentence

include the grade of the offense; mitigating or aggravating factors; that nature

and degree of harm caused by the offense (including whether it involved

property, irreplaceable property, a person, a number of persons, or a breach of

public trust),' the community view of the gravity of the offense; the public

concern generated by the offense,' the deterrent effect a particuLar sentence may

CA251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 13

have on the commission of the offense by others; and the current incidence of

the offense in the community and in the Nation as a whoLe. II

In Sham Sunder vs Puran and another 1990 (4) sec 731 has observed that,

"The Court in fixing the punishment for any particuLar crime shouLd take into

consideration the nature of the offence, the circumstances in which it was

committed, the degree and deliberation shown by the offender. The measure of

punishment should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence."

Still further in Shyam Narain vs State (NCT of Delhi) 2013 (7) see 77 has ruled

that,

"Primarily, it is to be borne in mind that sentencing in any offence has a sociaL

goal. The fundamental purpose of imposition of sentence is based on the

principLe that the accused must realize that the crime committed by him has

not onLy created a dent in the life of the victim but also a concavity in the sociaL

fabric. II

It will be appropriate the Judges to follow a strict guideline in deciding sentence.

Penal Code which was enacted in 1883 (No. 02 of 1883) was amended after 112

years, that is in 1995 (No. 22 of 1995) by the Legislature to curtail the powers of the

Judges regarding the sentence. This does not mean that this Court curtailing the

discretion of the Trial Jud'Je. Sentencing :5 soiely rest on the trial judge. It cannot be

uniformed in al! the cases. It vari,9s and depends on the facts before the trial judge. It

is mandatory for the judge ~o consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances

before him and to impose an appropriate sentence. Therefore, it cannot be an

arbitrary decision. It has t,] be well considered and well balanced judicial decision.

CA251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 13

In the case of, Keith Biliam (1986) Vol 82 Criminal Appeal Reports 347 stated

that,

"The crime should in any event be treated as aggravated by any of the following

factors:

(7) violence is used over and above the force necessary to commit the

rape;

(2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim;

(3) the rape is repeated;

(4) the rape has been carefully planned:

(5) the defendant has previous convictions for rape or other serious

offences of a violent or sexual kind;

(6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities or perversions;

(7) the victim is either very old or very young;

(8) the effect upon the victim, whether physical or mental, is of special

seriousness.

Where anyone or more of these aggravating features are present, the sentence

should be substantially higher than the figure suggested as the starting point. II

In Attorney General vs Ranasinghe and others (1993 2 SLR 81) it was held that,

"Aggravating factors would be

CA251/2013

(a) use of violence over and above force necessary to commit rape

(b) use of weapon to frighten or wound victim

(c) repeating acts of rape

(d) careful planning of rape

(e) previous convictions for rape or other offences of a sexual kind

(f) extreme youth or old age of victim

(g) effect up:m victim, physical or mental

(h) sUbjection of victim to further sexual indignities or perversions"

JUDGMENT Page 10 of 13

Basnayake A. C. J. in the case of Attorney-General vs. H. N. de Silva (57 NLR 121)

observed as follows.

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender~ Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a

position of trust or belonged to a service which enjoys the public

confidence that must be taken into account in assessing the

punishment. "

(emphasis added)

We have observed in many cases{ if not all, the sentence is imposed without giving

reasons. As we discussed above{ this is important as a matter of right the accused

should know the sentence and the reasoning for the sentence.

Judicature Act provides an Accused can appeal only against his sentence when he

pleaded guilty at the Original Court. Similar to a judge giving reasons for conviction

or acquittal, he must give reasons for the sentence.

It is observed the Accused-Respondent had pleaded guilty to all four counts.

Therefore Section 14(b) (1) of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 is to be considered.

CA 251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 13

, ':4ny person who stands convicted of any offence by the High Court may appeal

there from to the Court of Appeal-

In a case tried with :Jut Q jury as of right, from any conviction or sentence except

in the case where-

/. The accused has pleaded guilty; or

ll. The sentence is for Q period of imprisonment of one month of whatsoever

nature or a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees:

Provided that in every such case there shall be an appeal on a question of

law or where the Accused has pleaded guilty on a question of sentence only.

Now the appeal before the Court is only against the sentence.

For the purpose of clarity, we will summarize our concern as follows.

1. The Trial Judge after finding the Accused guilty before he proceeds to impose

a sentence he must hear both parties on sentencing.

2. The Learned Trial Judge should give reasons for his findings.

3. It will be appreciated that the Trial Judge should briefly mention what are the

aggravating and mitigating circumstances for his decision.

In short the Learned Trial Judge should be accountable for his sentencing.

Considering the facts that the victim child vI/as 5 year old, he had a bleeding injury in

his anus, the Accused-Respondent was his own uncle who was on a trusted

relationship and he was a person who W35 attached to the Sri Lankan Army whose

prime duty to safeguard the citizens of this country including the victim child are

considered as an aggravating factors. The age of the Accused- Respondent, his

CA251/2013 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 13

, service in the Army and the injuries he had received while in the Army and the fact

that he pleaded guilty are considered as mitigating circumstances.

In the light of the above reasoning we affirm the conviction and vacate the sentence

imposed and impose the following sentence.

The Accused-Respondent is sentenced to 12 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine

of Rs. 10,000/- in default 6 months Simple Imprisonment. Further we ordered to pay

Rs. 250,000/-compensation to the victim child in default 4 years rigorous

imprisonment. (if the compensation is paid it should be deposited in a Savings

Account on a State Bank on the account of the victim child.)

We direct the Registrar to forward a copy of this judgment to the Judge who

delivered the order and to the Director of the Sri Lanka Judges Institute for their

attention.

Appeal Allowed.
