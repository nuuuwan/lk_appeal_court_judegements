This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Western Province

holden in Colombo dated 24.05.2007.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) was at all times material to this application the Regional

Manager of the Maththegoda Branch of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent (3rd Respondent). On

10.11.1998, the 3rd Respondent sent a letter demand to the Appellant (Vide page 53 of the

Appeal Brief) calling upon the Appellant to pay the 3rd Respondent a sum of Rs 1, 918, 796/15

in respect of shortage of goods and money which had occurred during the period the Appellant

was the Regional Manager of the Maththegoda Branch of the 3rd Respondent.

Page 2 of 11

As the Appellant refused to comply with the said letter demand, the 3rd Respondent referred

the dispute to the 1st Respondent-Respondent (pt Respondent) in terms of section 58(1) of the

Cooperative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972 (Cooperative Societies Law). Upon receipt of the

reference, the 1st Respondent referred the said dispute for arbitration to the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent (2nd Respondent).

The 2nd Respondent made his award on 2000.06.07 in terms of which, the Appellant was

ordered to pay the 3rd Respondent a sum of Rs 1, 276, 841.65. Being aggrieved by the said order

of the 2nd Respondent, both the Appellant (Vide page 209 of the Appeal Brief) and the 3rd

Respondent (Vide page 257 of the Appeal Brief) preferred appeals to the pt Respondent in

terms of section 58(3) of the Cooperative Societies Law. The 1st Respondent by order dated

2002.06.26, revised the sum imposed by the 2nd Respondent and ordered the Appellant to pay

the 3rd Respondent a sum of Rs 1, 578,697.88. (Vide page 243 of the Appeal Brief). The Appellant

sought to quash both the initial arbitral award and the order of the 1st Respondent by invoking

the writ jurisdiction of the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo and sought

the following relief:

a) A writ of certiorari quashing the arbitral award made in arbitration case no. 12179;

b) A writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 26-06-2002 made by the pt Respondent in

appeal from the said arbitral award.

The learned High Court judge by her order dated 24.05.2007 dismissed the application of the

Appellant and hence this appeal.

The Appellant in his petition of appeal (Vide Page 01 of the Appeal Brief) contends that the

learned High Court judge has erred by failing to consider that the impugned arbitral award of

the 2nd Respondent was;

a) made after the holding of an inquiry which was in violation of the rules of natural

justice

b) made in total disregard and failed to evaluate evidence led at the arbitral inquiry.

Page 3 of 11

The Appellant also contends that the pt Respondent has exceeded her statutory authority by

allowing the parties to make oral representations afresh at the appeal inquiry.

I will first assess the arguments adduced by the Appellant to impugn the arbitral award of the

2nd Respondent. The documents on record indicate that the letter demand (Vide page 53 of the

Appeal Brief) sent by the 3rd Respondent to the Appellant broke down the total sum of Rs 1,

918,796/15 that was demanded into different headings. The most significant sum of money

demanded from the Appellant was Rs 1,612,568.32 under the head of a shortage of goods that

occurred between 01.06.1998 to 12.07.1998 due to a fire which broke out at the Maththegoda

regional branch of 3rd Respondent on 12.07.1998. The 2nd Respondent concluded that the

Appellant was only liable to pay Rs 1,130,965.45 under this head and not the initial Rs

1,612,568.32 demanded (Vide page 212 of the Appeal Brief). The Appellant has nevertheless

contended (Vide page 35 of the Appeal Brief) that the imposition of the said sum was unjust for

the following reasons:

I. The 2nd Respondent had failed to consider evidence which indicated that the goods

were damaged by the fire on 1998.07.12 due to the contributory negligence of the

Management and Board of Directors of the 3rd Respondent who had acquiesced in

allowing goods in excess of the maximum limit to be stocked in the Maththegoda

branch.

II. The 2nd Respondent had failed to consider evidence which indicated that the sum of

Rs 1,612,568.32 had been calculated by the officers of the 3rd Respondent in an

irregular manner without the presence or participation of the Appellant.

III. The 2nd Respondent had imposed the said sum without ascertaining who was

responsible for the fire at the Maththegoda Branch.

IV. The documents relied on by the 2nd Respondent arbitrator in arriving at his decision

were not lawful documents.

Correctness versus Lawfulness of the arbitral award

Before dealing with these individual contentions, it is necessary for this court to take cognizance

of the contention of the 1st Respondent (Vide sub-section 10 of the pt Respondent's written

submissions) that the Appellant is attempting to challenge the 'correctness' as opposed to the

'lawfulness' of the arbitral award by way of the High Court's writ jurisdiction. It is trite law that

a court exercising judicial review does not concern itself with the correctness of the decision

but only with its lawfulness. [Nicholas v. Macan Markar Limited (1985) 1 SrLL.R. 130 at 139].

The scheme of the Cooperative Society Law also indicates that the 'correctness' or merits of an

arbitral award is left to be determined on appeal by the Registrar of Cooperative Development

and not a civil court.

Section 58(3) of the said Law states that;

Any party aggrieved by the award of the arbitrator or arbitrators may appeal

therefrom to the Registrar within such period and in such manner as may be prescribed

by rules.

Section 58(5) of the said Law states that;

A decision of the Registrar under subsection (2) or in appeal under subsection (3) shall

be final and shall not be called in question in any civil court.

Section 58(6) of the said Law states that;

The award of the arbitrator or arbitrators under subsection (2) shall, if no appeal is

preferred to the Registrar under subsection (3) or if any such appeal is abandoned or

withdrawn, be final and shall not be called in question in any civil court.

The first question that needs to be answered therefore is whether the grounds of challenge

raised by the Appellant are seeking to challenge the 'correctness' of the arbitral award or

whether they are alleging that the findings of the arbitral award were made in ignorance of

relevant and established evidence on record.

Page 5 of 11

Generally, courts exercising judicial review do not review errors of fact made by administrative

bodies/officials, unless those errors of fact are linked to the assumption of the administrative

body's jurisdiction i.e. jurisdictional errors of facts.l [R v. Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington

Rent Tribunal {1951} 2 K. B. 1 at 6; Walter Leo v Land Commissioner 57 NLR 178]. One exception

to this general principle is the Ino evidence rule'. Wade and Forsythe, Administrative Law, 7th

Edition at page 312 observes as follows:

"'no evidence' does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to any case

where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the

finding, or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably reach that conclusion

on that evidence" ......... "It seems clear that this graund of judicial review ought now to

be regarded as established on a general basis'~ and forecasts that 'no evidence' seems

destined to take its place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires, so that

Acts giving powers of determination will be taken to imply that the determination

must be based on some acceptable evidence. If it is not, it will be treated as 'arbitrary,

capricious and obviously unauthorised'. /I

The observations made by the text writers about this ground of judicial review have been

adopted and endorsed by the Supreme Court in Kiriwanthe v Navaratne [{1990} 2 Sri LR 393 at

409] and in Nalini Ellegala v Poddalagoda [(1999) 1 Sri LR 46 at 52]. In Nicholas v Markan Markar

[{1985} 1 Sri. L.R. 130, pp. 140 - 141] the Court of Appeal cited with approval the following

dictum about the Ino evidence rule' in the leading English case of Edwards v. Bairstow [1956]

AC 14:

If .. it may be that the facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly

instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal. In

those circumstances, too, the court must intervene. It has no option but to assume that

there has been some misconception of the law, and that this has been responsible for

I See Barnett H, Constitutional and Administrative Law, 3rd Edition, Routelege 2014 at page 763 where it is stated that a court will be reluctant to review a non-jurisdictional error of fact because it is presumed that administrative decision makers have all the factual information on hand and are best equipped to make factual determinations

Page 6 of 11

the determination ..... I do not think that it matters much whether this state of affairs is

described as one in which there is no evidence to support the determination, or as one

in which the evidence is inconsistent with, and contradictory oj, the determination, or

as one in which the true and only reasonable conclusion contradicts the

determination".

In effect, the no evidence rule has opened up a very narrow path for courts to review non-

jurisdictional errors of facts. In the UK, a finding by an administrative body that has been made

in ignorance of established and relevant evidence has been held to be amenable to judicial

review. [Regina v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex Parte A (A.P.) [1999] 2 AC 330;

Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside MBC [1976] UKHL 62].

In Hasseen v Gunasekara and others [CA Application No. 128/86 C.A.M. 02.10.1995] this court

considered an order of the Rent Board of Review, affirming an order of the Rent Board which

had been "arrived at without an adequate evaluation of the evidence and by failing to take into

consideration relevant items of evidence which could have influenced the finding" and held

the Rent Board as well as the Board of Review had "erred in law by failing to take into account

relevant items of evidence in arriving at the finding" and therefore quashed the orders of the

Rent Board as well as of the Board of Review

Therefore, when a factual finding by an administrative body is not supported by the evidence

on record, or has been made ignoring relevant and established evidence on record, the court

has the ability to exercise judicial review. The first and second grounds for challenging the

arbitral award (see above) seem to have been made on this basis viz. that the factual findings

of the 2nd Respondent are not supported by or have been made ignoring relevant and

2 Per lord Wilberforce Sections in this form may. no doubt, exclude judicial review on what is or has become a matter of pure judgment. But I do not think that they go further than that. If a judgment requires, before it can be mode, the existence of some facts, then, although the evaluation of those facts is for the Secretary of State alone, the court must enquire whether those facts exist, and have been taken into account, whether the judgment has been made upon a proper self direction as to those facts, whether the judgment has not been mode upon other facts which ought not to have been token into account. If these requirements are not met, then the exercise of judgment, however bono fide it may be, becomes capable of challenge

Page 7 of 11

established evidence on record. Therefore, these two grounds of challenge can be considered

by a court exercising judicial review.

Pre-Constitutional Ouster Clauses and the Writ Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

Even if a court exercising judicial review is ordinarily competent to examine whether a

decision/finding of an administrative body is supported by the evidence on record, a further

legal issue which arises is whether section 58(6) of the Cooperative Society Law read with

section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance excludes the Provincial High Court's writ jurisdiction.

However, our courts have in a long line of decisions held that pre-constitutional ouster clauses

in legislation read with section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance do not have the capacity to

oust or limit the writ jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by virtue of Article 140 of the

Constitution. [Atapattu v People's Bank (1997) 1 Sri LR 208, 221 - 222; Sirisena Cooray v Tissa

Dias Bandaranayake (1999) 1 Sri LR 1, 13- 14; Wijeypala Mendis v Perera (1999) 2 Sri LR 110,

119; Moosajees Ltd v Arthur (2004) 2 ALR 1, 15)].

The reasoning adopted in the above decisions is that ouster clauses were inoperative in the face

of the Court of Appeal's constitutionally enshrined writ jurisdiction. This reasoning is equally

applicable to the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court which is also constitutionally

enshrined by virtue of Article 154P (4). Therefore, I am of the opinion that the constitutionally

enshrined writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court cannot be ousted by section 58(6) of the

Cooperative Societies Law read with section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance.

Therefore, the law as it stands in Sri Lanka allows a Provincial High Court to review the

decision/findings of an administrative entity exercising power within the Province on any ofthe

accepted grounds of judicial review. This would include judicial review on the basis that a factual

finding by that administrative entity is not supported by the evidence on record or that the

findings were made ignoring relevant and established evidence on record. The learned High

Court judge's order is to that extent erroneous, since it seems to suggest that the High Court's

powers of judicial review is limited to the grounds mentioned in section 22(a) and (b) of the

Interpretation Ordinance. (Vide page 324 of the Appeal Brief) The learned High Court judge has

Page 8 of 11

also concluded that there is no basis for the court to quash the arbitral award on the limited

grounds mentioned. It is therefore incumbent on this court to remedy the learned High Court

judge's error and assess whether the arbitral award is liable to be quashed on the basis that its

findings have been made ignoring relevant and established evidence on record.

Factual Evaluation

The Appellant's first contention is that the 2nd Respondent had made his determination ordering

that the Appellant pay a particular sum of money without considering evidence which indicated

that the goods were damaged by the fire on 1998.07.12 due to the contributory negligence of

the Management and Board of Directors of the 3rd Respondent who had acquiesced in allowing

goods in excess of the maximum limit to be stocked in the Maththegoda branch. A perusal of

the arbitral award shows that the 2nd Respondent has in fact taken cognizance of this evidence.

The relevant portions of the arbitral award (Vide page 235 and 212) state as follows:

1IC5)~e9 @25(5) (5)~255 (5)Lt3@ @@@ )@~~Z5)c8 25dCl e9ft Z5)6 2S)L253 ~25)6

The above portion of the arbitral award shows that the evidence alleged to have been ignored

by the 2nd Respondent has in fact been a central piece of evidence considered by him to justify

reducing the sum demanded from the Appellant by four lakhs. The Appellant's contention that

the arbitral award failed to take account of evidence as to the contributory negligence of the

officials of the 3rd Respondent is therefore clearly unsustainable.

Page 9 of 11

II

The next contention of the Appellant is that the 2nd Respondent had failed to consider evidence

which indicated that the sum of Rs 1,612,568.32 had been calculated by the officers of the 3rd

Respondent in an irregular manner without the presence or participation of the Appellant. Once

again, the arbitral award itself is sufficient to show that the said piece of evidence has been

considered by the 2nd Respondent. The irregularities in the calculation of the remaining goods

by the officers of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent after the fire broke out was in fact used as

the basis to reduce the sum payable by Rs 81,622.87. The relevant portion of the evidence (Vide

page 235 of the Appeal Brief) is as follows:

"@@@ <33.253(5)255 Cf~af25)J@e)~ <g)~6 @25)J(5) .253~t6~~ (5)~255 (5)t~@@~ Cf~CSJ~ esf,~

Thus, it can be seen that the Appellant's request to this Court to quash the arbitral award on

the grounds that it failed to take account of relevant and essential evidence on record is

misconceived. It is only open to this court to ascertain whether the evidence referred to has

been given due consideration by the 2nd Respondent. I am of the opinion that the 2nd

Respondent has not ignored the said evidence but has given it due consideration.

The order of the 1st Respondent in Appeal

The Appellant has also argued that the pt Respondent has exceeded his statutory authority by

allowing the parties to make oral representations afresh at the appeal inquiry.

Section 58(4) of the Western Province Cooperative Societies Statute No 3 of 1998 states that

no party to an appeal made to the Registrar under subsection 3 shall be entitled either by

himself or by any representative to appear before or be heard by the Registrar on such appeal.

The wording of that section is identical to the wording of Section 58(4) of the Co-operative

Societies Law. Therefore, in ascertaining the scope of section 58(4) of the Statute, it is

permissible to consider interpretations given to the scope of section 58(4) of the Cooperative

Societies Law, as they are in pari materia. In Crosley v. Arkwright [(1788) 2 T.R. 603, 608, (1788)

100 f.R. 325, 328] Buller J. held that all Acts relating to one subject must be construed in pari

materia.

Page 10 of 11

to

Decisions on the scope of section 58(4) of the Cooperative Societies Law have recognized that

the section gives discretion to the Registrar to decide on the procedure to be followed when

hearing an appeal. [Piyadasa v. Sri Jayawardenapura Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd.

(2002) 3 SrLL.R. 294; P.R. Madduma Banda v. Mawanella Hemmathagama

Multipurposes Co-operative Society and others (C.A. (PHC) 68/2010, C.A.M 05.10.2018)]

Accordingly, it is open to the Registrar to determine an appeal either without hearing any party

to the dispute or by granting such hearing as he thinks fit.

Accordingly, I am unable to agree with the Appellant's contention that the pt Respondent-

Respondent exceeded his statutory authority by giving an opportunity for the parties to make

oral representations.

In any event, the record of the proceedings of the appeal hearing (Vide pages 224 -242 of the

Appeal Brief) shows that the Appellant has availed himself of the opportunity to make oral

representations before the 1st Respondent. It is trite law that an individual who has acquiesced

in a decision may not be granted a remedy if he subsequently seeks to challenge it. Therefore,

even if it be assumed that the procedure adopted by the pt Respondent was irregular, the

acquiescence on the part of the Appellant would have cured that irregularity, as that irregularity

would only have created a latent want of jurisdiction.

For the foregoing reasons I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court judge of the Western Province holden in Colombo dated 24.05.2007.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/=.
