E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J

The Petitioners filed this application on 09.02.2011 with regard to a construction

of an extension to a building within the Fasiyathul Nasriya Muslim Balika Vidyalaya

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the school) premises in Kalutara for the

purpose of a Ladies' prayer hall and subsequent naming of the said prayer hall by

the School Development Society (hereinafter sometimes referred as SDS). The said

building has been marked as X in the document marked P4 with the Petition. The

Petitioners' position is that the construction ofthe said extension was done without

obtaining the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities.

5

The Petitioners have pleaded that in December 2004, the school was severely

damaged by the Tsunami. Consequently, in or about the year 2007 the school was

reconstructed with the help of foreign donor agenesis. In January 2011, the School

Development Society (SDS) sought permission from the Zonal Director of Education

to build a Ladies' prayer hall annexed to the ground floor of the aforesaid building

marked as 'x' in P4.

It appears that the proposed prayer hall included an extension to the ground floor.

The Petitioners state that despite their objection, the said extension was

constructed by the SDS without obtaining the necessary approvals from Urban

Development Authority (hereinafter sometimes referred to as UDA), Coast

Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department ((hereinafter

sometimes referred to as CCRMD), and the Beruwala Urban Council. Furthermore,

the Petitioners aver that the new construction had been arbitrarily named as

"Masjid UI Abraar Ladies' Prayer Hall" and a colossal plaque had been erected

covering one of the side walls while permanently closing the large open windows

that were built on the said side wall for maximum view of the sea. The Petitioners'

contention is that the plaque too constitutes a structural change to the building.

The petitioners plead that;

1. The dedication of the building in the memory of persons named in the said

plaque is contrary to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education

marked as P8.

II

f f I

I I ! l

2. The new construction and the said structural changes to the building are

unauthorized and violate the provisions of UDA Law, the Coast Conservation

Act and the Municipal by Laws.

The Respondents have filed their statements of objections. Among other things

they plead the following grounds in opposing to the Petitioners' application.

1. This application of the Petitioners arises due to personal reasons based on a

rejection of a proposal by the 1st petitioner and his family members to name

the school in memory ofthe 1st petitioner's father and has nothing to do with

the said extension being an unauthorized construction. Hence the

Petitioners have not come to courts with clean hands.

2. In the aftermath of Tsunami, due to the urgency of resuming the education

of the students in the tsunami affected areas, with the approval of the

Ministry of Education and the Zonal Director of Education, the Non-

Governmental agencies with the collaboration of the Government

constructed the buildings.

3. However, the aforesaid constructions or reconstruction of damaged

buildings were done without the approval of the relevant authorities such as

UDA, Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department

(CCARMD) or relevant Urban Council. Therefore, they were originally illegal

constructions. (it appears not only the alleged extension and the structural

changes, even the main building too was illegal at the time of filing the

application by the petitioners.)

4. Nevertheless, after filing this application the 9th Respondent has regularized

the construction of the said extension by obtaining approval of the UDA, and

the CCRMD. Therefore, the proceeding with this application is futile. I

I l I I ,

1 j I I I I 'I I

5. The Ladies' prayer hall was a long felt need of the school and request to erect

a Ladies' prayer hall was made by the Trustees of the Masjid UI - Abraar

Grand Mosque (vide R2). With the approval of School Development Society

(SDS), the 9th Respondent with his recommendation forwarded the proposal

for the said prayer hall to the Zonal Director of Education and the Zonal

Director gave the approval to construct it under the supervision and

guidance of the Divisional Engineer. (vide R3)

6. A part of the ground floor of building marked X in P4 was converted to a

prayer hall. Since a space was required for worshipers to keep their footwear

etc., an additional extension was constructed as a veranda to the aforesaid

prayer hall.

7. Anyway, in view of an application made pending this application, the

Beruwela Urban Council has approved the said building plan and issued the

certificate of conformity on 03.09.2012 (Vide R6 & R7). Thus, the issues

relating to the legality of the said construction and structural changes of the

said building have now been cleared.

8. The Petitioners have not amended their petition and sought a quashing of

the said approvals which regularize any illegality that existed.

9. Though the Petitioners have stated in their counter affidavit that they are

entitled to get the Planning Committee Decision (4R18) quashed they have

not amended the prayer accordingly. Therefore, proceeding with this

application is futile.

10. Even though the approval of the UDA was not taken for reconstruction of

the buildings damaged by the Tsunami, pending this application, on an

1 i IIl f r I If I

I i l I I f ~ ~

I

8

application made by the 9th Respondent in September 2012, approval was

granted by the UDA according to law, rules and regulation.

l1.The Petitioners have not complained about the manner in which the

buildings had been reconstructed after the Tsunami without obtaining the

necessary approvals of UDA or the 4th Respondent, which clearly

demonstrate that the objection to the extension is due to collateral reasons

as mentioned before.

12.The building which is the subject matter of this action is situated within the

coastal zone and in terms of the Section 14(1) of the Coast Conservation Act,

no person can engage in any development activities within the coastal zone

without a permit issued by CCRMD.

13.The reconstruction of the building relevant to this application was without

obtaining any permit from the CCRMD. However, the Principal of the said

school made an application dated 20.04.2011 to CCRMD for the extension of

the ground floor of the said building (vide 3R1).

14.Since the said development activity was within the restricted area which falls

within the Set Back area where development activities are not generally

permitted, the said application was rejected (vide 3R2)

15.However, the principal of the said school made an appeal (3R3), urging a set

back area variance and which was considered by Cost Conservation and

Coastal Resource Management Advisory Council and the said Council

granted the approval for the extension of the said building subject to

conditions. {This court observes that as per the page 788 of the document

marked P22 by the Petitioners~ the said Advisory Council can determine

exceptions to the set back area (Buffer zone) for development activities

I I

~

within the coastal zone, if it is a nationally important project. Projects that

were done to recover from the damage caused by the Tsunami disaster

naturally falls within the term 'Nationally Important Project'.} The said

decision of the aforesaid Advisory Council has been communicated to them.

The facts revealed through the aforementioned pleadings filed by the

Petitioners and the Respondents clearly indicate that the relevant building itself,

not only the extension or structural changes complained of, was an illegal

construction at the time offiling this application by the Petitioners, but pending

the hearing of this application such illegalities were regularized by the relevant

authorities by granting relevant approvals.

In this backdrop it is important to see what the Petitioners have prayed for in

their Petition dated 09.12.2011. Among other things they have mainly prayed

for the following reliefs;

1. To Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 4th to

the 10th Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to allow and/or

facilitate the construction of the said new structure annexed to the said

Building X (as shown in PS) and the structural alterations effected on the said

Building X (as shown in P6)

2. To Grant and issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decisions if any, of the pt

to the 3rd Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to allow and/or

facilitate the construction of the said new structure annexed to the said

Building X (as shown in PS) and the structural alterations effected on the said

Building X (as shown in P6)

3. To Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the School

Development Society of the School comprising of the 9th Respondent and/or

the 11th to the 28th Respondents to name or facilitate and/or allow the

naming of the said Building X as "Masjid-UI-Abraar Ladies' Prayer Hall" and

the inclusion of a private memorial therein (as shown in P6)

4. To Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus against the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents compelling them to take all necessary actions under the

provisions of the UDA Law and the Regulations made thereunderto demolish

or remove the said new structure annexed to the said Building X (as shown

in P5) and restore the said Building X to the extent it is necessary thereof.

5. To Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus against the 3rd Respondent

compelling him to take all necessary action under the provisions of the CC

Act and the Regulations made thereunder to demolish or remove the said

new structure annexed to the said Building X (as shown in P5) and restore

the said Building X to the extent it is necessary thereof.

6. To Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus against the 4th to the 10th

Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to take all necessary actions

within their statutory powers to facilitate the demolition or removal of the

said new structure annexed to the said Building X (as shown in P5) and

restoration of the said Building X to the extent it is necessary thereof.

7. To Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus against the 1st to the 3rd Respondents

and/or the 4th to the 10th Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to

take all necessary actions within their statutory powers to remove the said

plaque erected along the elevation of one of the side-walls of the said

Building X (as shown in P6) and to restore the said Building X to the extent it

is necessary thereof.

8. To Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus against the 1st to the 3rd Respondent

and/or the 4th to the 10th Respondents and/or anyone or more of them,

compelling them to remove the denomination of the said Building X as

"Masjid-UI-Abraar Ladies' Prayer Hall" and the private memorial thereon (as

shown in PS and P6).

A careful perusal of aforementioned reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners indicate

that, they have prayed for writs of certiorari to quash the decisions taken by 4th to

10th Respondents, 1st to 3rd Respondents, 9th and 11th to 28th Respondents. Since

the date of the Petition is 09.12.2011, the decisions contemplated in those prayers

praying for writs of certiorari have to be understood as decisions that existed at the

time of filing the petition. As contended by the Respondents, no steps have been

taken to amend the prayers after the Respondents revealed that the relevant

building and/or extension including structural changes are now regularized by the

~ approval given by the relevant Authorities. What is not prayed for cannot be ....

granted by this Court. As there are no amended prayers to quash the approvals

granted pending the hearing of this application, the relevant buildings and/or

extensions or structural changes complained of have to be treated as authorized

constructions at this moment. Hence, the reliefs in the Petition that prayed for to

quash the decisions of the 1st to 3rd or 4th to 10th Respondents and the writs of

Mandamus prayed for to remove or demolish the relevant structures have become

futile now. Furthermore, as pointed out by some of the Respondents, neither the

11th to 28th Respondents nor the SDS they belong to, do any statutory functions.

,

i

\

f r

12

SDS does not appear to be a statutory body. Therefore, no administrative law

remedy is available against their actions.

Furthermore, this Court observes that the reliefs praying to quash the decision to

name the relevant building as 'Masjid UI Abraar' or to compel the Respondents to

remove the denomination of the said building are based on the guide lines and

instructions marked as P8 which were prepared by the Ministry of Education.

Basically, guide lines are given to develop best practices in the relevant service or

field. Since it is not a rule or regulation, this court doubts whether it creates any

public duty to be done by the relevant officers or rights that can be enjoyed or

enforced by the Petitioners. The Petitioners are silent with regard to the officer or

the officers who drafted or passed the said guide lines and the nature of the

authority he or they had to do that. However, it appears that the SDS has taken

approval for the contents of the plaque from senior officers of the Provincial

Education Department. (Vide X14 and X15).

On the other hand, the 11th to 28th Respondents have marked photographs of some

plaques within the same school premises containing similar details as X21 to X28.

This Court observes that the petitioners were not interested in challenging the

legality of constructions when the buildings were reconstructed after the Tsunami

disaster without necessary approval. They have become interested only when an

extension was done to an already unauthorized building. They were not interested

when other plaques were installed but only when the one in issue was installed.

This indicates that there may be a truth in the allegation made by some of the

Respondents that this application arose due to personal reasons.

For the foregoing reasons, I decline to issue writs of Certiorari and Mandamus as

prayed for in the Petition.

Hence, I dismiss the application.
