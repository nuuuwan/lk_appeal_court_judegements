M.M.A.GAFOOR, T.

This refers to an appeal from the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Badulla for the declaration of title to the land in

dispute action No.423/92 L.

The Plaintiff-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) both brothers had filed this action against their sister

who is the Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) for a declaration of title to the land and premises

described in the schedule to the plaint, which is produced and filed

of record.

The Appellants claimed their chain of title to the land in equal

shares by virtue of the Deed of Gift bearing No. 27248 dated

26/01/1967 attested by H.5.Abeysekera Notary Public, gifted by

their mother Heen Menike who was the original owner of the said

land in dispute.

Heen Menike had eleven children and all the children were

born in the land and premises described in the schedule including

the Appellants and the Respondent. Although there were eleven

5

children in the family, their mother had gifted the specified land

equally to the two children namely, D.M.Gunadasa and D.M.

Wijepala (the 1st and the 2nd Appellants) in 1968 and she died in

1978.

D.M.Gunadasa (the 1st Appellant) and D.M. Wijepala (the 2nd

Appellant) are the Donees of the Deed of Gift bearing No. 27248.

The 1 st Appellant was in Police service and lived in Horana.

When the Deed of Gift No. 27248 was executed, he was not

present to accept the gift made by his mother Heen Menike and then

the 2nd Appellant D.M. Wijepala (2nd named Donee) accepted the gift

for himself and on behalf of the 1 st Donee (D.M. Gunadasa).

Later the Appellants submitted that they had possessed and

enjoyed the land from 1968 to 1982, also they had rented out the said

premises and collected the rent for two years' of period somewhere

around 1974.

The Appellants further pleaded that in the year of 1982 they

allowed the Respondent being their sister to occupy the land and

house thereon with the leave and license of them and afterward the

6

Respondent commenced disputing the title of the Appellants and

refused to vacate the premises in suit and she had taken undue

advantage of the leave and license.

But the Respondent claimed that Deed of Gift No. 27248 is not

valid in law and she came into occupation of the said premises in

1982 and derived title to the property by way of uninterrupted

possession for over ten years and had been paying certain taxes for

the particular land and premises in dispute.

The learned District Judge of Badulla in his judgment delivered

on 22/02/1995, dismissed the Appellants action for the reason that

the Deed of Gift No.27248 executed by the parties in accordance with

Roman Dutch Law had not been properly accepted by one of the

Donee and held that hence after the demise of the Donor (the

mother) the 1/2 share of the premises had to be devolved upon the

other children of the Donor including the Respondent.

The Appellants pleaded that the finding of the learned District

Judge as to the acceptance of the Deed of Gift concerned was

erroneous as one brother could have accepted the gift on behalf of

\ r

7

the other and moves the aforesaid judgment of the learned District

Judge of Badulla be set aside and allow the appeal.

The bone of contention of this matter raises as an Issue No. 07,

before the trial Judge.

"Whether the Deed of Gift No. 27248 stated in the plaint is the

gift valid in law?"

General principles under Roman Dutch Law in regard to the

Deed of Gift is a contract and there must be a Donor and a Donee or

Donees to the transaction to make a valid gift.

The Donee by way of accepting the gift VIa placing his

signature at the time of its execution and no deed of gift is completed

until it is accepted by the Donee.

that:

In Wickremasinghe Vs. Wijetunga 16 NLR 413 Pereira J stated

"a donation of land must be notarially attested as much as the

making of the donation and the acceptance by the Donee

himself or by some person competent in law to represent the

donee for the purpose of entering into such contracts. But in

view of the long series of decisions it will be in expedient to the

question their correctness at this time of the day"

8

The Respondent submitted that though the both Appellants

got a gift of the land, there were eleven children in the family. The

mother gifted in 1968 and died in 1978. The gift has been accepted

only by one of the Donees. The 1st Appellant was in Horana, when

the gift was made. He did not accept the gift and also he admitted

the same before the learned trial Judge.

We have taken into consideration of the cases referred to us in

CheIIaih Vs. Sivasamboo 75 NLR 193, Abeywardana Vs. West 58

NLR 313, Bindua Vs. Untty 13 NLR 259, are which examined and

analyzed the relevant principle of law to develop and to implement

w here the property gifted to minors and the acceptance on behalf of

the minors.

It is noted that the 1st Appellant was 38 years old in 1968, and

lived in Horana could have been accepted the gift but he didn't. And

there was valid reasons shown by the 1st Appellant for his not

acceptance of the gift. The law and its principles favours the

acceptance of the gift on behalf of a minor but in the case of adults

there should b e a valid acceptance of the gift.

9

I am of the view that according to Roman Dutch Law, a Deed of

Gift is a contract and the principle of acceptance is essential for the

transfer of rights on a contract. And further the Donees were majors

at the time of the donation took place and there was no evidence led

to establish the fact that the 1st Appellant had accepted the donation

to complete the contract between himself and the donor. Further in

accordance with the judgment held in Wickremasinghe V s.

Wijetunga 16 NLR 413 that when a gift is being accepted by a third

party on behalf of a donee, the said person should have the capacity

and authority to accept the donation.

I am of the opinion that it has not adduced any evidence to

show any capacity or authority given to the 2nd Appellant to act or

sign and accept the gift on behalf of the 1st Appellant and by the 1st

Appellant.

It is observed that the learned District Judge relied strongly on

principles analyzed in the case of Wickremasinghe Vs. Wijetunga 16

NLR 413 and Roman Dutch Law principles and correctly arrived

his conclusions by answering Issue No.7 negative stating clear

reasons in his judgment.

10

I am of the firm view, that the 1st Appellant did not accept the

donation and therefore his half share remained the property of Heen

Menike and at her death should be devolved on all the eleven

children including the Respondent who is thus entitled to Ijllth

share of the 1/2 share. The 1st Appellant's gift is not valid and I affirm

the learned District Judge's judgment and dismiss the appeal with

costs.

I agree.
