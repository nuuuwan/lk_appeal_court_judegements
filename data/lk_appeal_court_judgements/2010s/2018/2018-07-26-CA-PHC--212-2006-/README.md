This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the North Central Province

holden in Anuradhapura dated 02.08.2006.

The Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent (Respondent) instituted proceedings in the Magistrates

Court of Anuradhapura in case No. 23670 under the provisions of the States Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 as amended (Act) to evict the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

(Appellant) from the land more fully described in the schedule to the aforesaid application.

The Appellant in his show cause moved for the dismissal of the said application due to, inter alia,

the failure on the part of the Respondent to comply with section 14 of the Act. The learned

Magistrate held with the Appellant and dismissed the application.

The Respondent moved in revision against the said order to the High Court of the North Central

Province holden in Anuradhapura. The learned High Court Judge revised the order of the learned

Magistrate on the basis that the learned Magistrate had incorrectly interpreted section 14 of the

Act. Hence this appeal by the Appellant.

Section 14 of the Act reads:

(1) In the exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under this Act

a competent authority shall be subject to the direction and control of the Minister in charge of

the subject of State lands.

Page 2 of7

(2) A competent authority shall not exercise any power conferred on him by section 3 in relation

to any land vested in, owned' by, or under the control of-

(a) the Sri lanka Army or the Sri lanka Navy or the Sri lanka Air Force, except with

the prior approval of the Minister in charge of the subject of Defence;

(b) the Urban Development Authority 'established by the Urban Development

Authority law. No. 41 of 1978, except with the prior approval of the Minister in

charge of that Authority;

(c) the Sri lanka Ports Authority established by the Sri lanka Ports Authority Act,

No. 51 of 1979, except with the prior approval of the Minister in charge of that

Authority.

The Appellant submits that in order for the Respondent to evict the Appellant from the state land

in dispute such process ought to be subject to the directions and control of the Minister in charge

of state lands. If not, the Respondent submits that a competent authority may act on his own

accord which may conflict with the control that the Minister exercises over the Respondent. It

was submitted that the Respondent had commenced proceedings against the Appellant without

the prior approval of the Minister in charge of state lands as such the proceedings cannot be

maintained. This submission is tenuous and devoid of any merit.

Section 14 of the Act has two sub-sections which deal with two entirely different situations.

Section 14(1) of the Act allows the Minister in charge of State lands to control and give directions

to a competent authority in the exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and

functions under this Act. It does not require a competent authority to obtain the sanction of the

Minister in charge of State lands prior to exercising, performing and discharging of his powers,

duties and functions under the Act. If the Minister in charge of State lands, gives lawful directions

to a competent authority, he is bound to follow them. Any unlawful exercise of such power by

the Minister is not binding on the competent authority.

On the other hand, section 14(2) of the Act prohibits a competent authority from exercising any

power conferred on him by section 3 of the Act in relation to any land vested in, owned by, or

under the control of institutions referred to therein without the prior approval of the respective

Minister.

If the legislature intended the restriction on the power of the competent authority set out in

section 14(2) of the Act to apply in a section 14(1) situation the same language would have been

employed in both situations. That has not been done. Therefore, I have no hesitation in rejecting

the submission of the Appellant on the need to obtain prior approval of the Minister in charge of

state lands where section 14(1) of the Act applies.

On the contrary, section 14(2) of the Act does impose a restriction on the power of the competent

authority. It is in this context that Jayasuriya J. held in Alwis v. Wedamulla, Additional Director

General of U.D.A. [(1997) 3 SrLL.R. 417] that proceedings in ejectment could be instituted by the

Urban Development Authority against a person who is in occupation of land vested in the Urban

Development Authority provided such application to eject is authorized and have had the written

approval of the Minister of Housing. He held that the proof of grant of such approval is a condition

precedent to the institution of proceedings in ejectment.

However, the judgement in Alwis v. Wedamulla, Additional Director General of U.D.A. [(1997) 3

SrLl.R. 417] was set aside by the Supreme Court in Wedamulla v. Abeysinghe [(1999) 3 SrLL.R.

26]. Amerasinghe J. in considering the second ground on which the Court of Appeal based its

decision stated as follows:

"With regard to the second ground, it might be assumed that the necessary steps were

taken, including the obtaining of the Minister's approval. Ominia praesumuntur rite et

solemniter esse acta. In fact, the Minister's approval under section 14 (2) of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act had been obtained prior to proceedings for ejectment

being taken. The Minister's order is dated the 17th of June, 1996."

Page 4 of 7

In my view, Amerasinghe J. did not uphold the position of the Court of Appeal that proof of grant

of such approval is a condition precedent to the institution of proceedings for ejectment. That is

why he sought to rely on the maxim Ominia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta which

means that there is a presumption known to the law that all legal and official acts are correctly

and duly performed by the relevant parties concerned. Omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter

esse acta (all official-acts are presumed to have been done rightly and regularly) [per Jayasuriya

J. in Jayasinghe v. Gnanawathie Menike (1997) 3 SrLL.R. 410 at 412]. It is only then that

Amerasinghe J. additionally refers to the fact that the necessary approval had in fact been

obtained.

Therefore, I am of the view that the correct legal position is that even where section 14(2) of the

Act applies, the competent authority need not produce the relevant approval with the

application made to the Magistrates Court. The scheme of the Act prevents such matters been

raised before the Magistrate.

A person who has been summoned in terms of section 6 of the Act can only establish that he is

in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. [Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd. v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority (1993) 1 SrLL.R. 219]

Where proceedings under the Act is commenced contrary to section 14(2) of the Act, the

competent authority is acting ultra vires which is an issue to be tested in appropriate proceedings

where administrative law principles apply. In Dayananda v. Thalwatte [(2001) 2 SrLL.R. 73 at 81]

this Court held that it was open for a party to seek to quash the quit notice by way of certiorari when

the determination was made by the competent authority.

In any event, the present application is not one that comes within section 14(2) of the Act as the

land in dispute does not come within that sub-section.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was correct in concluding that

the learned Magistrate had misconstrued the scope of section 14 of the Act.

Before proceeding to consider the other grounds urged by the Appellant I wish to state that

although I have held that the competent authority need not produce the relevant approval with

the application made to the Magistrates Court even where section 14(2) of the Act applies, the

procedure will be expedited by the competent authority submitting such approval along with his

application for ejectment. Such a course of action will certainly obviate separate proceedings

challenging the vires of the quit notice on that ground. The point I have made is that merely

because the competent authority fails to submit such approval to the Magistrates Court when he

initiates proceedings or during an inquiry, that is not a ground to dismiss the said application.

Another ground urged by the Appellant was that he had entered the land in dispute based on a

contract and as such no proceedings can be taken under the Act to evict him.

I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission which is the same position taken by the learned

Magistrate. A competent authority can have recourse to the Act to evict any person who is in

unauthorized possession or occupation of state land including possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land. Any possession or occupation without "a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law" is unauthorized

possession. The procedure in the Act can be resorted to even where a party came into possession

of the state land upon an agreement and the agreement has been terminated. The mere fact that

the rights and liabilities under such agreement can be the subject matter of a civil action does

not have the effect of placing the said state land outside the purview of the Act [Ihalapathirana

v. Bulankulame, Director General, UDA (1988) 1 SrLL.R. 416, (1988) II C.A.L.R. 100, Walker Sons &

Co. Ltd. v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another (C.A. 305/90, C.A.M. of 15.06.1995)].

In any event, the documents produced before the Magistrates Court clearly shows that the

permission given to the Appellant to occupy the land in dispute has been terminated by the time

proceedings were instituted under the Act.

The Appellant further submitted that the Respondent had failed to avail himself of the right of

appeal instead of which he resorted to the application in revision to the High Court. This

submission is devoid of merit. A right of appeal is a statutory right and must be expressly created

and granted by statute. [Martin v. Wijewardena (1989) 2 SrLL.R. 409]. Section 10(2) of the Act

Page 60f7

specifically states that no appeal shall lie against any order of ejectment made by a Magistrate

under subsection 10(1). Hence the Respondent correctly invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of

the High Court. Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was correct in

overruling this objection.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura dated 02.08.2006.

The Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.

The learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura is directed to comply with the aforesaid order of the

learned High Court Judge of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura expeditiously.
