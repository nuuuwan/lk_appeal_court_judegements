Argued and Decided on: 24.01.2018

S. Thurairaja, P.C. J

Accused Appellant is present in

Authority.

Court produced by the Prison

Counsel for the Accused Appellant made submissions and raises a

ground of appeal saying that the prosecution has failed to prove the

ingredient of the charge. Elaborating the ground of appeal she submits that

the weapon alleged to have used was not identified by the virtual

complainant. Therefore the charge failed. Learned Deputy Solicitor General

makes submissions and submits that he is supporting the conviction and

the sentence.

This incident had occurred on the 12.12.2005. The virtual

complainant was travelling from Batticaloa to Katunayake Airport to pick up

a passenger. On the way at Welikanda he was stopped by a torch signal.

When they stopped the vehicle the Accused Appellant had diverted them to

2

a by-road and robed the mobile phone and cash from them. Due to the

urgency and the importance, the virtual complainant had gone directly to

the Airport.

It was revealed before the Court that the Accused Appellant had

stopped the police vehicle in a similar manner and the Officer in Charge of

the police station had arrested the Accused Appellant almost close proximity

to the first incident. When the Accused Appellant was checked they found

an automatic weapon, a mobile phone and cash in his possession. He was

taken to the police station and the police were investigating into the issue.

The virtual complainant on the way returning from Airport to his

home at Batticaloa, proceeded to Police Station of Welikanda and lodged a

complaint. There he was shown the mobile phone and the cash. The virtual

Complainant identified the mobile phone and the amount of cash.

The Accused Appellant was tried before the High Court of

Polonnaruwa. There, the prosecution witnesses submitted that the Accused

Appellant had robbed them on a gun point. The virtual complainant had

submitted to Court that he can identify the type of the weapon and not the

particular weapon. He said that it is a weapon which is similar to a weapon

used by the police officers. When the weapon recovered shown to him he

could not identify that is the weapon being used for that robbery. The

counsel for the Appellant submits this brakes the prosecution by not

proving the ingredient. Reading the evidence of all witnesses it clearly shows

3

that the witnesses were very genuine and they have not been tutored by any

means because the witness could identify the type of the weapon and not

the exact weapon. In our view the exact weapon can be identified by the

serial number. A person who is maintaining the serial number or a ballistic

expert attached to the Government Annalist Department, after doing test

firing of the weapon. In this case the weapon comes within the definition of

the Firearms Act and which is not challenged by any party during the trial

nor in appeal.

Considering all the available material especially the judgment, the

Judge has considered all necessary ingredients of the charge and the

available evidence. Therefore we have no reason to interfere with the

judgment. Therefore we dismiss the appeal. Further regarding the sentence

the accused has been given the minimum mandatory sentence under the

relevant Act. Therefore we have no reason to interfere with the sentence.

Accordingly the appeal dismissed.
