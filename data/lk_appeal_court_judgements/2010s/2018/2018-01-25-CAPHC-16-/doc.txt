Judgement

K.K. Wickremasinghe The Absolute Owner Claimant Petitioner Appellant (herein after referred to

as the Appellant) in this case has preferred this appeal to this court after

being aggrieved by the order dated 18.02.2009 by the Learned High Court

Judge of Hambanthota and the order dated 21.02.2008 of the Learned

Magistrate Court of Tangalle.

Introduction

TheAppellant filed this appeal claiming the vehicle which was used to

commit an offence under the Animals Act. The accused pleaded gUilty to

the charge forwarded against him at the Magistrate Courts and he was

accordingly sentenced. The Registered Owner sought a vehicle inquiry. The

Registered Owner gave evidence and thereafter on 22.11. 2007 stated that

she would not be claiming the vehicle and that she has no objection for the

vehicle being released to the Appellant .At the conclusion of the inquiry,

which the vehicle was confiscated. The Appellant filed a revision application

to the High Court and the revision application was dismissed.

5

At the stage of the Argument the appellant submitted that owner is not

claiming the vehicle but he was making submissions on behalf of the

Registered Owner.

Facts of the Case

The vehicle in question was subject to litigation on two occasions, both

under the Animals Act .Both offences were under the Animals Act.

It transpired in evidence that the driver at the time of the second offence

which took place in 2005 was still in employment with the registered

owner. It was also laid before the Learned Magistrate in evidence that the

vehicle in question has holes, which facilitates transporting of cattle. The

registered owner took up the position that she was unaware of the changes

done to the vehicle.

She has simply stated that she has not told the driver to do anything illegal.

The registered owner stated that she has sublet the vehicle. According to

the registered owner the vehicle was used for the purpose of transporting

vegetables. In such event the registered owner was unable to explain as to

how the vehicle had cow don and blood.

The registered owner while giving evidence stated in examination in chief

that the driver's services were terminated, however in cross examination,

she admitted that the driver (the accused) was still in her services. This

demonstrates that the Registered Owner is not a credible witness as she

has contradicted herself in giving evidence.

The absolute owner has sent the registered owner a letter of demand,

which manifests that the absolute owner has sought refuge in civil law to

claim his rights.

6

Further, the Counsel for the appellant categorically stated, at the argument

stage, that the registered owner will not be claiming the vehicle. In view of

above, the only claimant is the absolute owner.

The learned counsel for the appellant stated that vehicle could be released

to the absolute owner as Sec.443A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

makes a preference of the absolute owner over the registered owner.

In the case of Orient Finance ltd Vs Range Forest Officer Ampara (SC

Appeal No.120/2011-Annexure 6) decided as follows

" ..... Generally the property is released to the person from whose custody or

possession the property was taken. The registered owner if he was not privy

to the commission of the offence on that basis he is entitled to possession of

the vehicle. Sec.443A changed this position when it stated that the absolute

owner is deemed to be the person entitled to possession of such vehicle ....

Under section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Ac, after the conclusion of the

case, if the vehicle is not confiscated, the vehicle should be released to the

absolute owner and not to the registered owner. "

However, in the instant case the conduct of the registered owner manifest

that she has not taken precautions to avoid the offence being committed.

The registered owner has also not been made a party to this case. The

name of the registered owner is Paragaha Thanthirige Suneetha Malkanthi,

is not apparent in the caption. The Registered Owner has stated that she is

in agreement to give the vehicle to the absolute owner. The Absolute

Owner then went in revision to the High Court against the confiscation

order and has now appealed to the Court of Appeal.

7

It is decided law in our Jurisdiction that in a vehicle inquiry the Registered

Owner has to discharge the burden on a balance of probability, on two

grounds. The decision in the case of Mary Matilda v OIC Habarana CA (

PHC )86/87 is amply clear that simply telling the driver is insufficient. It

was held that tithe owner of the vehicle to discharge the burden that she

had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence, mere giving instruction is not sufficient."

It was decided in the above case that the owner should take positive steps

to prevent the commission of the offence. And it was further decided

therein that simply telling the driver/ accused does not amount to a

positive step. The registered owner, in this case, has simply told the

absolute owner not to use the vehicle for any illegal purpose and has failed

to prove on a balance of probability that she took all precautions to prevent

the offence taking place.

In the case of Manawaduvs AG ( 1987 2 SLR 30 ) it was decided that the

onus of proof in a vehicle confiscation lies on the Claimant . The

Respondents state, that the Claimant in this instance failed to discharge his

burden.

The Orient Finance Services Corporation Ltd case ( SC Appeal no 120 /

2011)held that the owner should on a balance of probability prove that the

offence was committed without the knowledge or that all precautions to

prevent the offence was taken.

Therefore the registered owner, is not a party to this appeal. The registered

owner is estopped from making claim by her own actions, the registered

owner has not established on a balance of probability that she took all

precautions to prevent the offence taking place.

Considering the above circumstances we are of the view that this court has

no basis to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.

Therefore, the Appeal is hereby dismissed.
