ORDER RELATING TO THE APPLICATION FOR INTERVENTION

P Pad man Surasena J

This Court heard the submissions of parties with regard to the application

for intervention made by the proposed intervenient petitioners.

-A Divisional Bench of this court has decided in the case of Weerakoon and

another vs Bandaragama Pradeshiya Sabhawa {C A Writ Application No.

586/ 2007 [(Decided on 2011-11-22) (2012 BLR 310)]} that interventions

in a writ application is not possible.

The said Divisional Bench of this court after consideration of the relevant

judgments has held that the Court of Appeal Rules 1990 do not provide for

third party interventions in applications for Prerogative Writs.

Thus, due to the presence of a judgment pronounced by a Divisional Bench

of this court, this court at this stage does not intend to reconsider this

aspect of law in the instant case.

For the above reason, this court is not in a position at this moment to

entertain the instant application for intervention in this proceeding since

this is a proceeding with regard to an application for prerogative writs.

5

Thus, in view of the ruling of the Divisional Bench of this court above

referred to, this Court decides to refuse the application for intervention.

Further, this Court in a subsequent application! also has desisted from

allowing the application made in that case for intervention based on the

above divisional bench judgment.

Application for intervention refused.

PRESDIENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

A L Shiran Gooneratne 1

I agree.
