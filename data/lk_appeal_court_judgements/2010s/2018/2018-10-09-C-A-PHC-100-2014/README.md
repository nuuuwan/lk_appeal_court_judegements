ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

1/ Appellants") have invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court in

appeal Nos. CA (PHC) 126/2014, CA (PHC) 100/2014, CA

(PHC)101/2014, CA (PHC) 97/2014 and CA (PHC)173/2014 in respect of a

common order pronounced by the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo on 08.07.2014 in respect of their revision

application Nos. HCR 38/2012, 43/2012, 44/2012, 45/2012, 46/2012,

47/2012,48/2012 and 50/2012.

In seeking revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court, the

Appellants sought to set aside orders of the Magistrate's Court of

Colombo, upon applications made under Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act as well as Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

In issuing the impugned order under Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act, the Magistrate's Court had ordered the fiscal on

05.09.2007 to deliver possession of the lands described in the schedule to

the application as part 1 and 2. Thereafter, it made another order on

16.11.2011, directing the fiscal to re-deliver possession of the land. Upon

application, further time was granted by that Court to the fiscal to deliver

possession and with his report dated 12.02.2015, it was reported that he

could not deliver possession of the land, due to public intervention.

At that stage, the Appellants sought to invoke revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

3

It is stated by the Appellants, in their applications to Court that they

have occupied the land in dispute for a very long time and it has been

acquired by the State under provisions of Land Acquisition Act on the

basis that the lands are adjacent to the Kolonnawa Oil Refinery and there

exists a security threat to that facility.

The 1st, 3rd and 4th Applicant-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the 1/1 st , 3rd and 4th Respondents") in their statement of

objections took up the position that the land under dispute had already

been acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and they

have completed the payment of compensation to the list of interested

parties who were in possession when the acquisition process began. They

also stated that the notices of possession had been issued as admitted by

the Appellants and the Magistrate's Court has issued the impugned orders

after applying the relevant statutory provisions.

In dismissing the Appellants applications for revision, the Provincial

High Court is of the view that by the publication of an order in the

Government Gazette No. 488/13 of 13.01.1988 the land in dispute is clearly

vested in the State and is entitle to take its possession. It is further noted

that in an application under Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, the

Magistrate's Court had to issue an order as requested for if it is satisfied

that the applicant apprehends that he will be unable to take possession of

the State land because of any obstruction or resistance likely to be offered.

In this instance, the 1st Respondent, in his application under Section

42(2) clearly averred in paragraph 4 that he apprehends that he will be

unable to take possession of the State land because of any obstruction or

4

resistance likely to be offered. It also noted that prior to acquisition, the

Appellants had to be given an opportunity to present their position at

various levels, but once an application is made under Section 42(2) for an

order of possession, the law has not afforded an opportunity for the

Appellants to show cause.

The Appellants, in seeking to challenge the validity of the orders

contended that;

a. the 1st Respondent instituted eviction proceedings before the

Magistrate's Court unde~ the provisions of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act,whereas the Court had made order

under provisions of Land Acquisition Act,

b. since the Appellants were seryed with quit notice under the

provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, they

have a "mandatory right" to show cause in terms of Section 6 of

the said Act,

c. the Provincial High Court has failed to consider the fact that

there is a long delay of taking steps and as at now the public

purpose for which it was acquired, namely the security concerns

of the refinery no longer exits,

d. the Appellants were not paid any compensation.

==--;;;;..._-======

The proceedings before the :Magistrate's Court had begun with the

filing of applications under Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act. In

addition to his application under the said law, the 1st Respondent, having

served quit notice on the Appellants, had made a parallel application

under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act as well.

However, the order of the Magistrate's Court was made under

Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act and it appears that the

application under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

deemed abated since no order was made and no further interest was

shown by the 1st Respondent in pursuing it. -The Magistrate's Court, nonetheless acted correctly in making its

order under one of the statutes, although the 1st Respondent has invoked

its jurisdiction also under different statute, seeking identical relief.

The validity of the order under Section 42(2) of the Land.

Acquisition Act could not be challenged merely because a parallel

application is also made by the 1st Respondent under Section 5 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, which had not been acted upon by the

Court.

In relation to the Appellant's second ground of appeal that the

Appellants were served with quit notice under the provisions of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act and as such they have a "mandatory

right" to show cause in terms of Section 6 of the said Act should be

considered next.

In the preceding paragraphs, this Court noted that although parallel

applications were made by the 1st Respondent under two different statutes, 6

=================================~-=-=-=.======~

the Magistrate's Court had acted only under provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act.

A respondent in an application under Section 5 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, could show cause under Section 6(1) of the

said Act. Section 6(1), lays down the initial step a Court should take, as it

imposes a duty on the Court to issue summons on him. It is on the

summons, that a Respondent is directed to show cause, why he and his

dependents" should not be ejected from the land as prayed for in the application

for ejectment." In this particular instance, the Court had acted under Section

42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act. It did not assume jurisdiction by issuing

summons on the Appellants to show cause under Section 6(1) of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

In contrast to Section 6(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act lays down the

applicable considerations as follows;

"Where any officer directed by an Order under section 38 to take

possession of any land is unable or apprehends that he will be

unable to take possession of that land because of any obstruction

or resistance which has been or is likely to be offered, such officer

shall, on his making an application in that behalf to the

Magistrate I s Court having jurisdiction over the place where that

land is situated, be entitled to an order of that court directing the

Fiscal to deliver possession of that land to him for and on behalf of

the State."

7

The scope of the jurisdiction under Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act has already received attention of this Court. In

Gunawardene v D.R.D. Weligam Korale 69 N.L.R. 166, it was held that;

"The wording of section 42 (2) seems to contemplate that before

an officer could obtain an order under that section he must satisfy

the Court that he is unable or apprehends that he will be unable to

take possession of the land because of any obstruction or resistance

which has been or is likely to be offered. I find from the cyclostyled

application that has been filed in Court by the District Revenue

Officer that he proceeded to the land on 24. 9. 66 in order to take

possession of the land from the owner thereof who wrongfully and

unlawfully refused to allow the applicant to take possession. The

District Revenue Officer also states in the same application that

he apprehends he will be unable to take possession of the said land

by reason of obstruction or resistance that is likely to be offered by

the owner. While I agree with the observations of my brother

Sirimane, J. in Mohamed Lebbe v. Madana [(1964) 66 N. L. R.

239.1, that when an order under section 42 (2) directing the Fiscal

to deliver possession of the land is made, any person in occupation

of the land is not entitled to be heard in opposition to the

application, I think it desirable, even though these proceedings are

in the nature of execution proceedings, that there should be

evidence either orally or on affidavit led before the Magistrate in

support of the averments in the application before an ejectment

order is made, particularly when a request is made for the use of

force, if necessary, to take possession of the land. This evidence

may be led ex parte and if the Magistrate is satisfied with the

8

material placed before him, an ejectment order under section 42

(2) may be issued." (emphasis added)

Thus, it is clear that in an instance where an application is made

under Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act to the relevant Magistrate's

Court, there is no opportunity afforded to any Respondent to offer show

cause as to why he and his dependents" should not be ejected from the land as

prayed for in the application for ejectment" as in Section 6(1) of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act.

In relation to the contention of the Appellants that there is a long

delay in the application to evict them would not make them entitle to relief

as the issue placed before the Provincial High Court for its determination

was the legality and propriety of the order made by the Magistrate's Court,

and not the validity of the actions of the 15t Respondent.

The complaint that the Appellants were not paid any compensation

is also made without a legal basis. The 15t, 3rd and 4th Respondents, in the

objections filed before the Provincial High Court had adequately explained

this issue. When the authorities initiated the process to acquire the land

described in the 15t part of the schedule to the application under Section

42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, they have clearly identified the

individuals who were in possession of the said land and they were already

paid compensation. In any event, in an application under Section 42(2) of

the Land Acquisition Act, the non-payment of compensation could not be

considered as a relevant ground a Court should take note of.

9

In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs, it is

our considered view that the appeals of the Appellants are devoid of any

merits and therefore ought to be dismissed.

The appeal Nos. CA (PHC) 126/2014, CA (PHC) 100/2014, CA

(PHC)101/2014, CA (PHC) 97/2014 and CA (PHC)173/2014 are

accordingly dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 5000.00 on each appeal.
