CThis case raises the uS~Jal contest between the papt':r title pleaded by a Plaintiff and Q) prescription that is put forward by two defendant~ to defeat the paper title. Whilst

the plaintiff is the daughter of one M.M. Haniffa, thf two defendants claim to be the

children of one M.M. Noordeen who was the brother of the said Haniffa. In other words,

the two defendants are the children of the Plaintiff's pc.ternal uncle. By a plaint dated 5th

April 1994, the Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'Plaintiff')

instituted this action pleading her title to the land in contest which had devolved on her

by a deed of gift bearing No. 39143 of 28th September 1972. She prayed for a declaration of

title and ejectment of the Defendants in the main. Tie donor-- Mohamadu Haniffa of

Warakamura, Ukuwela, ~Aatale-- the father of the P!c:datiff made this settlement on his

daughter-- the Plaintiff as an irrevocable gift on her marriage. Admittedly, long before the

donor--father parted witl,. this property in favor of his daughter, he had permitted his

2

,-

'I

brother~ the father of the defendants~ Noordeen to oc,:~py the land. The land in contest

is more fully described in schedule 'B' to the plaint. The narrative of the Plaintiff as to her

ownership of the land gCI~s further in that in paragraph 7 of the plaint she asserts that

what is depicted in the sJ.:hedule 'B' to the plaint is the balance portion of the land that , remains with her after a;l extent of 15 acres was sold,by her to a 3rd party. It is worth

n~cording at the outset tl::lt at the trial the Defendants admitted the title of the Plaintiff

1 to the land which had devolved on her by the afores8:d deed of gift bearing No. 39143

dated 2srh September 1972. It was also admitted that the said Noordeen the paternal

uncle of the Plaintiff and bther of the Defendants passed away in 1987. The said NDordeen

had also been a witness to the deed of gift bearing No .. ~9143 dated 28th September 1972

wherein his brother Mohlmadu Haniffa had donated this property to the Plaintiff.

Thus, apart from the admi~sions the defendants made ~'~ to the ownership of the ,Plaintiff

to this property, the p~"?decessor of the Defendants namely Noordeen had been fully

aware of the transfer of tiJe to the Plaintiff by her fathe~ as he had subscribed to the deed

. -I of gift as a witness. It ':"1S the contention of the Plaihtiff that after the demise of her

paternal uncle Mohamad .... " Noordeen who had been le~ on the premises to look -after the

property, the pt and 2nd Defendants who claimed to be the children of the deceased

Noordeen entered the lan~ and began to dispute the 0'1 rnership of the plaintiff.

, ~ As opposed to this ven:ion of the Plaintiff RespOlldent the Defendant~ Appellants

(hereinafter sometimes foVferred to as the "Defendants':) filed answer putting forward a

deferent version of event~" namely they had been living with their father Noordeen on

-_ 1 :. these premises for a Ion 5 time and even after the death of their father in 1987 their

possession had continue,:-' giving rise to a possession of more than 10 years which would

entitle them to a prescriptive title. In the circumstances the Defendants prayed for a

dismissal of the Plaint and a declaration that they wel;c the sole legal owners of the land

described in the schedule to the answer.

.'

Thus, there were two rival claims before the learned 1 iistrict Judge of Matale namely a

declaration of title prayed for by the Plaintiff and ejectment of the Defendant on the one

hand and a claim for declaration of title based on prescription on the part of the

Defendants. When the trid was taken up, several admissions were recorded among which

one finds an unambiguous admission as to title of the plaintiff to the property.

It is trite law that once the title of the plaintiff is admitted in a re vindicatio action, the

burden shifts to the defendant to show that his possession is lawful~see Wanigaratne

, vs.JuwanisAppuhamy(65 N.LR.l67) where HeratJ~ (with AbeyesundereJ agreeing)

held:

"It has been laid down by this Court that in an action rei vindicatio the plaintiff should set out

his title on the basis on which he claims a declaration of title to the land and must, in Court, prove

that title against the defendant in the action. The defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not

prove anything, still less, his own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his

favour merely on the-strength that the defendant's title is poor or not established. The plaintiff

must prove and estab!ish his title".

Following the above dechion, it was held in the case of Sumanawathie vs. Jayakaduwa

(2012) B.LR. Vol. XIX Part II, p. 308 that in an action 'rei vindicatio' the Plaintiff must

prove and establish title. Only when the legal title to th~ premises is admitted the burden

of proof is shifted to the Defendant to show that his oC2upation is lawful. A similar view

was taken in the case of JVadduwage Dharmadasa fl,'. Manthree Vithanage jinasena

, " (2012) B.LR. Vol. XIX, Part II, p. 336, where Anil Gooneratne J held that, "in a rei

vindicatio action the Plail .tiff must prove and establish his title. If the Plaintiff has so

, established his title, the r ,urden of proof is shifted to th;: defendant to establish his lawful

occupation if any."

The allegation of the Plaintiff in this case was that the .IJossession of the Defendants had

been unauthorized.

Before I look at this que:,tion and dispose of it, the learned counsel for the Defendant

Appellants attempted to impugn the judgment of the learned District Judge of Matale

, dated lOth September 201') by reference to a document: marked P8 dated 28th May 1974.

This was an affidavit th.,t the uncle of the plaintiff and father of the two defendants

, Noordeen had executed 13 years prior to his death in 1987 deposing to the fac .. that he

had come on the land in contest with the leave and license of the plaintiff and her father

Haniffa. As this affidavit, which admitted the leave and license given to Noordeeli, would

~ . . . cut across the case of pre;;cription put forward by the ddendants, the learned Counsel for

the defendants Mr Ganesnarajah strenuously contended that this affidavit could ~lOt have

; .; been used by the Learned District Judge of Matale to ccnclude on permissive possession.

As this contention turns -:m the admissibility of an affi~vit given by a deceased person,

1 would focus on this ar~ument presently after having dealt with some other items of

,

~vidence, which Mr Gan::sharajah urged, advanced th~ case of prescription.

Other Items of Evidenct: to establish prescription.

The question arises whether the Defendants have established in this case that their

possession was lawful. H'lS their claim of prescription trumped the paper tit~e of the

plaintiff? It has to be bo "'ne in mind that the case of the plaintiff is that the leave and

licence terminated with rile demise of Noordeen in 19b? and therefore the possession of

this land by his adopted (hildren~the Defendants could not be lawful. The allega~ion was

that the defendants enteled the premises in 1987 follo.,ving the death of their father ~the

i licensee. But the defendaI~ts have traversed this plea and. taken the stance at the trial that

their predecessor and t4~y had been on the land for Dore than 10 years. What are the

, -items of evidence that the Defendants led to establish t~lis position? The learned Counsel

\ for the Defendants relied en electoral registers marked as 2V2 to 2V 4 where the :pames of

5

T

; .., the Defendants are refleqed under Mohamed Noordeql ~ a fact which only supports the

position of the Defendant~ that they had been living on the land with the said Noordeen,

., after having been adopted by him. Yet, one has to remember the evidence led on ~ehalf of

~he Plaintiff that the poss,ession of Noordeen was permissive. Noordeen had been left on

the premises with the leave and licence of the predeces<::or in title of the Plaintiff and this

title passed to the Plaintiff in 1972 by way of a deed of gift. Thus there was no adverse

possession on the part of j'~oordeen to tack on. This wa&~the argument of Mr N.M.Shaheid . : , ' who appeared for the Plaintiff. This is where the affida\it given by the deceased

Noordeen becomes vitaL , The fact that the adversity 'vyrhich is required for prescription

. '. never began is manifested by the affidavit of NoordeeJ1 dated 28th May 1974. Noordeen

passed away on 29.08.l98'?~see his death certificate marked as P17 at page 176 of the appeal

brief and in this affidavit Noordeen quite clearly declar~d that his possession of the land , was with the leave and licence of his brother Haniffa a~:~d thereafter the plaintiff~the one

who holds the paper title.to the land. I have to consider the effect of the affidavit at this

stage because the elector~tl registers I have spoken to,above have been put forward as

., , indicative of independen; possession by Noordeen and the defendants. The Defendants

argue that these electoral registers begin from as far :Jack as 1965. As opposed to the

electoral registers there i~ the affidavit of Noordeen in 1'~74 admitting a possession which

., depends on the title of t~Le plaintiff. Taken on its face value the admission by ~oordeen

that he was a licensee of tJ1e plaintiff and her father cut~ across the case of the Defendants

.1 that Noordeen's possession was adverse and they have rrescribed to the land. That is why , " , . the contents of the affich;vit given by Noordeen becomes dispositive of the issue in the

case~whose title is superbr? Is it the title of the plaintiff which has been admitted by the , Defendants or the presc"iptive title claimed by the Defendants, which if established

would defeat the paper tide.

I Contents of the affidavit dated 28th May 1974

It was only in 1972 that the plaintiff became the owner of the land and in 1974 the occupier , of the land Noordeen gavt an affidavit. In this affidavit ,Noordeen an ex~village headman , 1 6

affirmed that his brother Iv10hamadu Hanifa's daughter Siththy Sirin the Plaintiff in the

case was the owner or/ar.i proprietor of all that land called "Polgahamula Watta" situated

at Warakamura as depicted in Plan No.2056. He further stated in that affidavit that he

" had obtained permission 1,.0 occupy the said land called 'polgahamula Watta" and the house

standing thereon, with ,he leave and license granted to him by the Plaintiff and her

predecessor in title who\vas her father and his brother)

Giving the solemn underl~king to look after the said lind and house and maint(ljn them , in good condition and repair, the said Noordeen deposed in that affidavit that he would

vacate and deliver vacant possession of the said land a ld house to the said Plaintiff, her

heirs, executors, adrninist rators and assigns as soon as J I demand was made. This affidavit

.)f Mohamadu Noordeen ('vnfirmed that he had been there on the land with the leave and

license of the Plaintiff ani her predecessor in title M~ M. Haniffa. This shows that the

character of possession of Mohamadu N oordeen the pr~decessor in title of the Defendants

! had been qua a licensee. It is admitted by the predeces~or of the Defendants that he was

allowed to occupy the land in dispute as a licensee by h-)th the Plaintiff and her b.ther. In

other words, the said N00rdeen has accepted the own~rship of his brother and his privy

and he cannot therefore df~ny during the continuance Q~ such license the title of the other

person- see Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance Nhich codifies the common law

principle of estoppel. Noordeen who entered with the: leave and licence of the cwner of

the land could not claimi:dverse possession or ownership to th'~ owner unless t1lere was

an identifiable event wru(h signified an ouster.

"

In the case of CheUiah V~. Wijenathan 54 N.LR. 33Ttlt 342 GratiaenJ. (v,ith Alan Rose

C.] concurring) held:

"Where a party invokr::; the provisions of Section 3 of the pJ escription Ordinance, in order to defeat

the ownership of an ad-,ferse claimant to immovable prGfJ"~rty, the rJ1,lrden of proof rest~ squarely

and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or hfY acquisition ojprescriotive rights".

.-I 7

, I

The Defendants who clair1s prescriptive title to the land in dispute by adverse po~session

must establish a startinb point when their adverse ~)ossession commenced and they

~' ~ became entitled to the lalid. In Tillekaratne vs. Bastiall 21 N.LR 12~the full bench of the

Supreme Court (BertramCJ, Shaw and De Sampayo JJ) formulated three propositions of

law applicable to what .is meant by the word "advdse" in terms of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance {l~specially at page 18).

The proposition that is arposite to the instant case is a~ follows:

, "A person who has ent{;,red into possession of land in one capacity is presumed to continue to possess

it in the same capacit)i"

The Supreme Court obf.erved in the case that; "the 9Tect of this principle is that, where any

-, person's possession was origint;!1y not adverse, and he claims that,it has become adverse, the onus is on him

to prove it. And what must he }rove? He must prove not only an intention on his part to possess adversely,

but a manifestation of that intmtion to the true owner against whqm he sets up his possession. .... ,I (at page

19)

<

But here the predecessor i.n title to the Defendants claiined permissive possessi~~l rather

than adverse possessibh. If entry into possession is on a dependent title, the

fIcknowledged principle' in our law is that possessioq is presumed to continue in that

capacity. In other word,'" prescriptive possession \\~,ll not commence to run in this

situation until and unless: the possessor clearly manife~ts a change in causa to possess on

fin independent and adT).=:rse title. In this connectio~J the courts have postulated the

, , principle that the mere c,flimus to possess ut dominus is; insufficient and there must be a

verifiable manifestation of that intention as a precondition to the acquisit~on of a

prescriptive title. A coronary to this principle is that.the change of character must be

I ' shown to have begun "r': a particular point of time and continued undisturbed and

uninterrupted for ten y~ars prior to the institution of the action. The permissive

~ possession as is found in; this case must have turned adverse at one point. This is what

-, Gratiaen J. pointed out as the starting point of prescription in CheDiah vs. Wijenathan

54 N.LR. 337 (supra)~see also the dicta of G.P.S. De ?ilva C.J (with Kulatunga J. and

,I

,. 8

Ramanathan J. concurring) in Sirajudeen and two others vs. Abbas (1994) 2 Sri.LR 365

at p 370 (SC) alluding to the words of Gratiaen J. in Cl,eUiah vs. Wijenathan. G.P.S. De

Silva C.J pOinted out in.~lrajudeen that the necessity to look for a starting point is a

relevant aspect of the pleCl. of prescription which must be borne in mind by trial judges.

But has this starting poin : been established? The affida'.rit would negative any possibility

of a starting point being established in light of the fact that Noordeen deposed to a . . . permISSIve posseSSIOn.

Purpose of Giving the Affidavit

Noordeen had passed a\V:1Y on 29.08.1987 and the affidavit was produced and marked at

the trial through a Grama Sevaka/one Haniffa Mohamt:d Haseem who was married to the

daughter of a brother of l.Joordeen. The Grama Sevaka testified that he was a witness to

the affidavit given by Ncordeen. He saw Noordeen sii91ing the affidavit. Here was the

evidence of a witness who saw the deponent of the affidavit subscribe to the affidavit. The

witness further stated that the purpose of giving r:he affidavit was to enable the

disbursement of a bank h-;an to the plaintiff, by way of c. mortgage secured over this land.

By 1974 , the owner of the: land was the plaintiff who \vanted a loan and it is consistent

with reason and lOgic that the lender bank possil:Jy wanted a security free from

encumbrances and this:~eems to have been the objec~ive behind giving the afHdavit on

the part of Noordeen. Th~ occupier Noordeen affirmed to the bank that he was a licensee

with the sufferance of his brother and later his niece. AJ:ter this affidavit was given, there

is testimony on record th.".t the plaintiff proceeded to e~>;.ecute a mortgage on the same day

as the affidavit namely 2U.05.1974 in favour of the Rurcll Bank, Ukuwela and obtained a

loan of a sum of Rs 5,000.

It is this affidavit given hy Noordeen which has impelled the learned District Judge of

Matale to hold that the permissive possession of Noor(~een never turned adverse.

The learned Counsel for the Defendants Mr Ganeshal:ujah strenuously argued that the

affidavit was taken only -:or the purpose of obtaining J' loan and it is conclusive only on

; . that fact. It is not proof er:ough of leave and licence. In'vther words, this conteni:ion was

9

an invitation to reject the declaration of Noordeen in t(e affidavit that he was a licensee. , It is worthwhile to recall that Noordeen crossed the gfE~at divide in 1987 and his affidavit

was produced by a witn~ss to the affidavit in 1999 duriag the course of the trial. . . Mr Ganesharajah argued .:hat the contents of the affida'rit cannot be used to establish the

fact that Noordeen was a l~censee. It could only be used (0 attest to the fact that Noordeen

--the uncle of the plaintiff ~ave the affidavit for the purpose of enabling his niece to secure

the loan.

" lam afraid I would disagree with this argument. The cd:btents of the affidavit of Noordeen

were those of an absent:: witness when the trial came around. But his affidavit spoke

volumes of the leave and ~icense and his intention to gi'y'e up possession on demand. The

import of Mr Ganesharajah's argument was that other than for establishing the purpose

of the affidavit, the conV:nts of the affida'rit could not be used to establish leave and , ' licence. I must observe rrat when the affidavit was teOJ::lered in evidence, it became part

of the record without any' objections on the part of the. J)efendants. But it has to ~e noted

that the learned District J}dge of Matale relied on the cc ntents of the affidavit to conclude

that there was in esse leave and licence and this charactei'did not change at any stage prior

to the institution of thE-'. action in 1994. I must ob$~rve that no legal prindple was

; , advanced before me to pr.~clude Court from relying on :~he contents of the affidavit.

Admissibility of an Afftrlavit of a Deceased Person . ,

! , The only objection that c~)tild be possibly taken to the 'Jdduction of the affidavit ~vidence

is that the maker of the dbcument was not before Court~and therefore it would be hearsay

to lead the evidence of an'absent witness like NoordeeI1.

, But our Evidence Ordinance contains within it exceptions to hearsay from Sections 17 . It

is the general rule of law '(hat hearsay is no evidence, tl).at is, a witness who has received

from someone a narrati' e whether oral or written, ... lescribing some fact in issue or

I " relevant fact is not alloVv ed to give that narrative in eyidence to prove the truth of the

contents thereorsee the Privy Council decision from:, Malaya Subramanium v Public

10

Prosecutor (1956) 1 W.LR 965. The general rule is that the informant must be called as

a witness- The King v Karthigesu (1946) 47 N.LR 234.

,I But our Evidence Ordinance has enacted exceptions tdhearsay in Sections 17 td,39. It is

\ the general rule of law that hearsay is no evidence, that is, a witness who has received

from someone a narrative, whether oral or written, describing some fact in issue or

I' , relevant fact is not allowed to give that narrative in eVidence to prove the tru~h of the

contents thereof -see Sujramaniam v. Public ProsecLltion (1956) 1 W.LR. 965. The

general rule is that the il#ormant must be called as a ,witness- The King v. Kathigasu

! ~ " (1946) 47 N.LR, 234 at 235. But there are exceptions to this exclusionary rule of evidence

I that enable the adductio~~ of contents of a document s;uch as an affidavit of a deceased

person. The classic defirdtion of hearsay was given by ~.tt. Honorable LM.De Silva in the

i. Privy Council decision ofiSubramaniam v. Public Pro~;ecution (1956) 1 W.LR. 965:

Evidence of a statement made to a witness by ~ person who is nor himself called

as a witness mayor may not be hearsay. It is hear;say and inadmissible when the object of

the evidence is to estJ'b-lish the truth of what is contained in a statement. It is not hearsay and

admissible when ~ t is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the

" statement, but thr: fact that it was made.

, If the object of the affide.vIt evidence is to prove the truth of what it states to wit the

deponent Noordeen ente.:-ed the land as a licensee thel~ it is shut out as hearsay and the

affidavit cannot be led uni:~ss the maker of the affidavit is called. In this instance the maker

I . of the affidavit cannot be;~':alled but it is axiomatic that any item of hearsay evidence can

be led provided there i:,' an exception to the rule :against hearsay in the Evidence

Ordinance. So one has to find one rrovision between Section 17 to 39 (exceptions to

hearsay) to justify the reception of this hearsay evidenq.:. In my view it is section 32 falling

, under the rubric "Statemt;nt by Persons who cannot h~ called as witnesses" under which , the affidavit evidence of c'eceased Noordeen could be It'd..

11 ,I'

..

, Section 32 of the EvideEce Ordinance admits statements, written or verbal, of relevant

facts, and made by perso~s who are dead. Section 32(3) makes statements of a deceased

person relevant in a trial if,

1. it is a statement against the pecuniary or pn;prietary interest of the person

making it; or

2. it is a statement wI'Lich, if true, would expose hL;l or would have exposed him to a

criminal prosecuti<")l1 or to a suit for damages.

The section gives two illt:strations to this subsection, to wit, illustrations (e) and (f)

which show as to how st>ltements of deceased would 'r.: e used in a trial for their truth. In

f. the same way when Noordeen made a statement in the' affidavit that he was a licensee or

a tenant, it was definitelv a statement against his prGprietary interest. This admission

implies that his possession of the land was in a dependent capacity and it goes against , any claim of prescripti01~. To that extent of excluding an assertion of prescription, the

statement in the affidavit:,is against the proprietary irf~erest of Noordeen and i~ can be . . used in the trial for its trl~:th under Section 32 (3) of th~ Evidence Ordinance.

, .. , ~.'

The affidavit can be addu.qed under Section 32 (3) of t~lt: Evidence, as an exception to the

Iule against hearsay. The Court can act upon it as subst~ntive evidence. The rationale for

reception of such stater~lents is the presumption th8t what a man states against his , tnterest is generally true. Experience tells us that self-irt,erest induces men to be f.:autious

in saying anything ag;, . lnst themselves and wheII: one makts a declaration in

disparagement of his OWIl rights or interest, it is generally true and because it is so, the

~aw has deemed it safe te' admit evidence of such decl.~i:'ations. So the argument that the

; ~ ,: 1 affidavit cannot be relie~ '.1pon for the truth of what it 3f:ates is patently wrong and has to

be rejected.

In the end this statem~D.t in the affidavit is relevant and admissible to pr~)Ve that

Noordeen's possession \vas permissive and the leave ,.;Ind licence terminated :vhen he

passed away in 1987. In 1993 the plaintiff complained :.-lgainst the Defendants to police-

see the document 2VI.

12

~ .. ." .

This case was instituted in 1994 and if one takes the VIew that adverse possession was

, manifested in 1987 by the entry of the defendants into the land after their father had , passed away, there is no ~:ontinuous manifestation of adversity between 1987 and 1994,

which is only a period off years.

Therefore the claim of the Defendants that they had prescribed to the land cannot be

supported having regard LO the evidence. I must advert to another point Mr Ganesharajah

. \ raised namely Noordeen ~ad effected a partition by a ~eed bearing no 454. On a perusal . .' .I , of this partition deed it ~illy becomes apparent that th~ defendants had been living on a

different land. There is n) misdirection whatsoever as regards this deed of partition by

the learned District Judge.

In the end the prescriptfve plea raised by the defend(~nts fails and accordingly I affirm

1 the judgment of learned District Judge of Matale dated 10.9.1999 and I proceed to dismiss

the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants .
