Judgment

S.Thurairaja PC J

The Accused appellant (Hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant), was

indicted by the Hon. Attorney General at the High Court of Polonnaruwa for the

Murder of Hondamuni Soysage Tilakaweera, an offence punishable under section 296

of the Penal Code. After the trial the Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to

Death.

ThwProsecution lead the evidence of 11 witnesses, namely 1. Kadirawala Thambige

Podinona. 2. Deewala Gedara Piyaseeli. 3.Kontha Thambi Yogeswari. 4. Inspector of

Police (IP) Gabadage Don Namal Gunaratne. 5.Dr. Keerthi Kularatne Weerakody. 6.1hala

Arachchlage Jayantha. 7.IP. Wanasinghe Arachchilage Herby Nihal Jayatileke. 8.

PC.2085 Kandekumbura Gedara Weerawanse. 9. Velayuthan Sarojini. 10. Dharmarajage

Priyanganie. 11. Court Interpreter Mahesh. When the defence was called the Appellant

made a statement from the dock and called 3 witnesses.

The case for the prosecution is that the Appellant had shot the deceased. There is an

alleged eye witness to the incident. The Appellant denies committing the murder. The

learned Trial Judge being convinced with the evidence against the Appellant found the

appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to Death. Being aggrieved with the said

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 10

conviction and the sentence the Appellant had preferred the instant appeal and

submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. Appellant was denied of a fair trial by the refusal on the part of the learned trial

Judge to recall PW1 who was the sole witness and whose evidence was led

before the predecessor.

2. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself on a critical issue of fact thereby

causing serious prejudice to the appellant.

3. The Conviction which hinges on the unreliable and infirm evidence of the sole

eye witness is wholly unsafe.

4. Evaluation of the Dock Statement is legally and factually flawed.

The Prosecution witness number 1, Dharmarajage Priyanganie, was not available at the

beginning stage, because she had gone to Middle East for employment. Subsequently

when she returned her evidence was led by the prosecution. She is the only eye witness

to the incident.

The trial was taken up before several Judges and it was adopted under section 48 of

the Judicature act. On the 25th July 2007 when this case was taken up a new judge had

succeeded to the High Court. The Prosecutor made an application to adopt the

evidence up to that time, the Counsel for the Appellant conceded to all evidence but

the evidence of the PW1, and made an application to recall the witness. Both counsel

made submissions and the learned Trial Judge held that,

same application and the court will be inundated with these type of applications and

cases cannot be concluded, therefore this application cannot be allowed.

Adoption of proceedings is governed by section 48 of the Judicature act 2 of 1978.

Section 48 makes specific provisions. It will be appropriate to refer section 48, it is

reproduced for easy reference as below;

Section 48- Provision for continuing any case begun before a Judge becoming disabled.

In the case of death sickness, resignation removal from office, absence from

Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before whom any action, prosecution,

proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry preliminary to committal for trial

or otherwise, has been instituted or is pending, such action, prosecution,

proceeding or matter may be continued before the successor of such Judge

who shall have power to act on the evidence already recorded by his

predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him

or, if he thinks fit to re-summon the witness and commence the proceedings

afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter (except on

an inquiry preliminary to committal for tria/) is continued before the successor

of any such judge, the accused may demand that the witnesses be re summoned

and reheard (Emphasis added)

In the instant case the appellant had made an application to recall only one witness

out of 10 witnesses whose evidence were led earlier.

It is imperative to consider the legal provision, i.e. Section 48 of the Judicature Act

which says, that the accused 'MAY DEMAND' the witnesses be re summoned and

reheard.

https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com defines the demand as follows;

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 10

f f I: rt

Ir I f II

I

Demand

Peremptory allegation or assertion of a legal right

A demand is an emphatic claim, which presumes that no doubt exists regarding

its legal force and effect It is a request made with authority.

Cambridge Dictionary defines as follows;

Demand means, to ask for something forcefully, in a way that shows that you

do not expect to be refused

Oxford Dictionary defines as follows;

An insistent and peremptory request made as of right

The Law Dictionary (Black's Dictionary) defines as follows;

What is DEMAND?

v. In practice. To claim as one's due; to require; to ask relief. To summon; to call in

court.

When we read the definitions above it appears that the accused has a right to have

the witness to be recalled. But I, perused the Sinhala version of the Judicature Act it

says (~@~) that means request.

It will be of academic interest to discuss about the Demand and request. Whether, it is

Demand or Request, it stems from the Rights enshrined in the Constitution. Article 13

of our Constitution states as follows;

Art. 13 - Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment, and prohibition of

retroactive penal legislation.

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 10

f I ,

(1) No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by

law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest

(2) Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal

lIberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court

according to procedure established by la~ and shall not be further held in

custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of

the order of suchjudge made in accordance with procedure established by law.

(3) Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in person

or by an attorney-at-law, at a fair trial by a competent court

(4) No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of

a competent court, made in accordance with procedure established by law. The

arrest holding in custody, detention or other deprivation of personal liberty of

a person, pending investigation or trial, shall not constitute punishment

(5) Every person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty:

Provided that the burden of proving particular facts may, by law, be placed on

an accused person.

(6) No person shall be held guilty of an offence on account of any act or

omission which did not at the time of such act or omission, constitute such an

offence, and no penalty shall be imposed for any offence more severe than the

penalty in force at the time such offence was committed

Nothing in this article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for

any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal

according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of

nations.

It shall not be a contravention of this Article to require the imposition of a

minimum penalty for an offence provided that such penalty does not exceed

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 10

t i I I

the maximum penalty prescribed for such offence at the time such offence was

committed

(7) The arrest holding in custody- detention or other deprivation of personal

liberty of a person, by reason of a removal order or a deportation order made

under the provisions of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act or the Indo-Ceylon

Agreement (Implementation) Act or such other law as may be enacted in

substitution therefor; shall not be a contravention of this Article.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Sri Lanka is a signatory nation,

provides for fair trial;

Article 10: Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an

independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of his rights and

obligations and of any criminal charge against him.

Article 11: (1) Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be

presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which

he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence. (2) No one shall be held

guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not

constitute a penal offence, under national or international law, at the time when

it was committed Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was

applicable at the time the penal offence was committed

J.A.N. De Silva J (as he then) in Attorney General vs. Aponso (SC appeal No. 24/2008)

2008 BLR 145. Held that 1/ the right of an accused person to a fair trial is recognised in

all the criminal justice systems in the civilised world Its denial is generally proof

enough that justice is denied The right to a fair trial was formally recognised in

International Law in 1948 in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Since

1948 the right to a fair trial has been incorporated into many national regional and

international instruments.

Like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is also not capable of a clear definition but there

are certain aspects or qualities of a fair trial that could be easily identified"

In the instant case the reason given is that 90% of the case in the said Court are in

similar situation, allowing the application will open the flood gate. It appears that we

have to decide whether Right of an Accused or Convenience of the Court.

In Kaluwahumpurage Somapala vs. The Commission to Investigate Bribery and

Corruption CA (PHC) 37/2006 Decided on 03 -02 -2010. A.W.A.Salam J

discussed a similar situation "In Terms of the proviso to section 48 of the

Judicature Act the Accused has a right demand that the witness already

testified before the previous Judge be re summoned and reheard and it is

within exclusive discretion of the Judge to allow such an application or refuse it

for reasons to be stated as inasmuch the accused has a right to make a demand,

he has the unfettered right to know the reason for complying or not complying

with his demand as well."

Considering section 48 of the Judicature in the light of above legal provisions, the law

is clear that the Trial Judge must take a Judicial Decision. It is our considered view that

the reason given by the Learned Trial Judge does not come with in the ambit of a

Judicial decision.

Judicature Act section 48 proviso is a direct flow of Article 13 of the Constitution which

is there to safeguard the Right of Fair Trial. When the right is given to a person

especially, to an accused, it should not be denied or curtailed without acceptable and

valid reasons.

Jago Russell Said, " Every person accused of a crime should have their guilt or

innocence determined by a fair and effective legal process. But the right to a

fair trial is not just about protecting suspects and defendants. It also makes

societies safer and stronger. Without fair trials, trust in justice and in

government collapses."

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 10

Considering the impugned order, we find the reasons given for denial of the request

to recall the witness is incorrect and unacceptable, hence further proceedings from

that order becomes unacceptable. The formal order at this point is to send back to

continue the trial from the place where the denial order was made by the Judge, but

we will consider the entire case before we make the final order.

The second ground of appeal is that the Learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself

on the facts. The 3rd ground is that the Learned High Court Judge had not reasonably

considered the contradictions and omissions. The Fourth ground of appeal is that the

Learned Judge had not evaluated the Dock Statement legally and factually.

The Prosecution had led evidence of 11 witnesses. As per the Prosecution evidence the

story is as follows; on the 24th September 1999, the accused appellant who was a Home

Guard (Grama araksha Bataya) was seen shooting the deceased Hondamuni Soysage

Tilakaweera, with the gun in his possession. After the shooting he went away and

arrested late in the night. It appears they had some dispute previously.

Prosecution witness No.1 Dharmarajage Priyanganie, (Page 72 of the brief) was the

only eye witness to the incident, she claims that the deceased was related to her was

her uncle, on the fateful day at around 5.30 in the evening when she was at the veranda

of her home feeding her daughter. She had seen the deceased was going in a bicycle

and coming to her house, at that time the accused had also came on a bicycle. She

said that she knows the accused from her childhood. The Appellant was in the bicycle

and asked the deceased "Shall we Challenge today" Ccr: C5>t8@ ID@~t;) and shot him

once. The deceased collapsed on the spot. She identified the clothing's of the deceased

and the weapon used. She was subjected to cross examination there she admitted that

the appellant is related to her. The Defence brought to the notice of the Court, that

she did not say that the appellant challenged the deceased neither to the Police nor

to the Magistrate.

The Appellant had marked a contradiction (V1) to the effect that the Appellant had

fired two shots at the non-summary inquiry. Considering the omissions and

CA/54/2008 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 10

contradictions we are of the view that the learned Trial Judge has not given due

consideration to the facts.

Further, considering the reasons stated by the Trial Judge in the Judgment, we find

that the reasoning does not reveal of a well-considered finding.

After carefully considering the evidence, Judgment, submissions by both Counsels and

the written Submission of the Appellant (State had not filed their written submissions)

we find is not safe to up hold the Conviction. Therefore, we find that the Accused

Appellant is not guilty of the charges preferred against him, accordingly we allow the

appeal and acquit the Appellant.
