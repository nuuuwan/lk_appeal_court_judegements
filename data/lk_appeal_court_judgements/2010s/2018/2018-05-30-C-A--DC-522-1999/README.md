A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

The Plaintiff~Respondent instituted this rei~vindicatio action praying, inter alia, for;

a) declaration of title for him and 3rd to 6th Defendants (his siblings) is respect of a

land known as "Kethikanadeniya Owita" as depicted in the schedule to the

plaint;

b) ejectment of the tt and 2nd Defendants from the land and restoration of

possessions;

c) damages in a sum of Rs. 800 as prayed for it in the plaint.

The Plaintiff traced his title to his father Wijesundera Pathirana Arachchige Davith

Singho who, the Plaintiff alleged, owned the land in question. On his intestacy, the

Plaintiff averred that title devolved on his children, namely the Plaintiff, Missie Nona

(3rd Defendant), Hinnihamy (4th Defendant), Wijesena (5th Defendant) and Hinninona

(6th Defendant). The Plaintiff stated further in his amended plaint his siblings~the 3rd,

4th, 5th and 6th Defendants did not join him in the litigation to sue the 1st and 2nd

Defendants, he made them Defendants to the case.

The cause of action alleged against the 1st and 2nd Defendants~a wife and husband

combination was that they forcibly entered the land on or around 14.11.1983 and

unlawfully tapped the rubber trees for latex and ever since had remained on the land. In

other words, whilst the Plaintiff alleged title for him and his Defendant siblings flowing

from their late father, his complaint against the wife and husband (the Defendant) was

that of unlawful possession on the land.

Answer of the 1st and 2nd Defendants

The husband and wife (lst and 2nd Defendants) filed a joint answer denying the title of

the Plaintiff and set up their issues.

1. Was Wijesundera Pathirana Davith Singho entitled to Kethikanadeniya Owita

as referred to in the Amended Plaint?

2

2. Did the rights of Davith Singho devolve on his children as referred to in the

Amended Plaint?

3. Did the rights of the children devolve on Plaintiff and others referred to in

Amended Plaint?

4. Have the Plaintiff and other children have acquired a prescriptive title having

possessed for over 10 years?

5. Did the 1st and 2nd Defendants on or about 14.11.1983 forcibly entered the said

land and are in forcible possession?

6. If the said Issue is answered in the affirmative is the Plaintiff entitled to the relief

claimed?

7. Is the disputed land consist of Lots 16 to 20 of the land partitioned in B.1094 of

this Court?

8. If so can the Plaintiff maintain the above action?

9. Has the 2nd Defendant acquired a prescriptive title to the said land?

This is a rei vindicatio action and it is trite law that the requisites of a vindicatory action

consist of two elements, namely; (a) the Plaintiff must be the owner of the property

and (b) that the property is in possession of the Defendant. The basic principle of rei

vindicatio action is that the Plaintiff must have title to the land in dispute. Without a

proper title, he cannot ask for a declaration. It is therefore to be borne in mind that the

burden is on the party who claims title to a property must adduce evidence to prove his

title to the satisfaction to the Court. If he has no title, the Court cannot declare him

entitled to the property. Our Courts have always emphasized that the Plaintiff who

institutes a vindicatory action must prove title - see the pronouncement of Herat ]. in

Wanigaratne v.JuwanisAppuhamy65 N.LR.167 (with Abeysundere,].):

"In an action rei vindicatio the plaintiff should set out his title on the basis on which he claims a

declaration of title to the land and must, in Court, prove that title against the defendant in the

3

.-

action. The defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove anything, still less, his own title.

The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the

defendant's title is poor or not established. The plaintiff must prove and establish his title."

In this case, the Plaintiff alleged that he, along with his siblings 3rd to 6th Defendants

inherited the land from his father Davith Singho and the 1st and 2nd Defendants (the

appellants in the case) entered the land described in the schedule to the plaint entered

the land on 14.11.1983 forcibly and had been in possession since then.

No deed was produced by the Plaintiff to establish title but rather documents marked

as follows: /

Pl. 29.06.1960/ this letter sent from the Office of Rubber Controller in indicative of

subsidy given to Davith Singho (possibly the father of the Plaintiff) to re/

cultivate rubber on an estate called Kethikanadeniya Owita.

P2.04.06.1960 / this was a letter sent to an unnamed person in respect of an estate

small/holding known as Kethikanadeniya Owita, under a Rubber Replanting

Subsidy, Scheme, notifying the unnamed addressee that the application for

subsidy has been sent to a named officer therein.

P3.01.09.1959 / this is a voucher showing a payment of Rs.1,OOO// to W. Davith

Singho under the Rubber Planting Subsidy Scheme for replanting a small/

holding Kethikanadeniya Owita.

P4. 05.04.1961/ by P4 the said Davith Singho was informed that an inspection had

been placed for July 1961 for the purpose of considering the disbursement of the

5th installment of subsidy for rubber repainting.

P5.01.09.1050 / a cheque for Rs.100 was being sent as rubber subsidy to Davith

Singho for replanting.

All these letters marked PI to P5 originated from the Rubber Controller indicating

either a payment of a subsidy for replanting rubber on a small/holding called

Kethikanadeniya Owita or an intimation that some preparatory act prior to payment of

4

subsidy would be made. P3 shows that the extent authorized for Davith Singho to

replant rubber in 1958 was 2 roods, whereas his son Gnasena the Plaintiff claims a rei

vindicatio action for an extent of 1 acre and 6 perches.

In my view, these letters from the Rubber Controller could hardly demonstrate the title

of Davith Singho to the extent of 1 acre and 6 perches that the plaintiff claims. No

doubt, the letters show that Davith Singho had been engaged in replanting rubber on a

small holding called Kethikanadeniya Owita but on a smaller extent than that claimed

by the son (the Plaintiff) and these letters do not show that Davith Singho had been

engaged in rubber cultivation qua an owner or in a independent capacity. In my view,

these letters cannot amount to proof of title as adverted to by Herat,j. in Wanigaratne

v. Juwanis Appuhamy (supra).

The 1st issue on behalf of the Plaintiff was whether the land claimed belonged to

DavithSingho. This issue has been answered in the affirmative by the learned

Additional District judge of Balapitiya. The items of evidence relied upon by the learned

Additional District judge of Balapitiya to answer the 1st issue in favour of the Plaintiff

are PI to P5. Even though the Plaintiff produced these letters, it is crystal clear that he

could not have proved and established the title of his father on the strength of letters

dispatchedby the Rubber Controller.

Another reason proffered by the learned District judge to utilize PI to P5 as proof of

title is that according to him the Defendants had not challenged PI to P5 when they

were produced. In a rei vindicatio action, the onus of proof is on the Plaintiff to prove and

establish title by preponderance of evidence. The failure to object to the letters from

Rubber Controller, Colombo may go to reception and admissibility of hearsay evidence

provided they are relevant and admissible. Even if these letters are relevant items of

evidence, would there be any weight attached to these letters to prove title? Assuming

that the learned District judge admitted the letters in question, having decided that it

is relevant to the factors in issue, are they admissible in law in the sense that it does not

fall foul of any exclusionary rule in the Evidence Ordinance? It is then the task of the

5

fact finder to go into this question and assess the extent to which the evidence as a

whole proves the facts in issue in the case.

Ian Dennis in his' The Law of Evidence' (5th Edition 2013) quite pertinently observes

that weight of any particular item of evidence is the strength of its tendency to prove

one or more of the facts in issue, when considered in conjunction with the other

evidence in the case ~ see Ian Dennis para 4~00l at 4~001.

In no way does the learned District Judge give reasons as to how the weight of PI to P5

can prove the fact in issue in the case namely the title of Davith Singho. There is no

analysis as to how PI to P5 issued long time ago in 1969 and produced at the trial in

1994 are relevant and admissible. In the circumstances the affirmative answer given by

the learned Additional District Judge to Issue No.1 is erroneous and therefore there is

no proof that Davith Singho the father of the Plaintiff was proved to have been the

original owner of the land claimed by the Plaintiff in the schedule to the plaint.

If this was the case, issues relating to intestacy and devolution of title to the Plaintiff

and 3rd to 6th Defendants through the father could not have been answered in the

affirmative.

The partition case B.1094 wherein the final partition decree was entered as far back as

14.09.1969 merits mention at this stage. In this case Davith Singho was the 43rd

Defendant, whereas his mother Athukoraralage Emalishamy was the 42nd Defendant.

Despite the fact that Davith Singho contested and vied for rights in the land sought to

be partitioned in the case, in the end he did not obtain any rights in the land. The

Plaintiff whilst giving evidence admitted that his father Davith Singho did not get any

rights to soil or plantation in the land~see proceedings dated 10.09.1996 (page 185 of the

appeal brief). The final partition decree was marked at the trial as VI~see 57 of the

appeal brief and Gunadasa ~the 2nd Defendant~Appeliant in this case is reflected in VI

as the 94th Defendant. The Final Decree VI awarded shares to the 2nd Defendant~

Appellant Gunadasa and his case before the District Court was that he had been in

possession of the lots allotted to him namely lots 16 to 20 as one land as there were no

6

boundaries between these lots. It has to be remembered Lot 13 was allotted to

Gunadasa in common with the 92nd, 93rd, 95th, 96th and 9th Defendants in the case. This

partition action was decided in 1969 and if Davith Singho through whom the Plaintiff

claims in the case had a right to the land, it boggles one's mind as to why Davith Singho

could not get any rights in the land. It is also beyond comprehension as to why the

rubber planting subsidy documents which would have been available with Davith

Singho were not put forward before the District Court in that partition action. These

documents some of which were issued in the 60's were put forward only in this rei

vindicatio action. Therefore the Plaintiff's father could not have become an owner by

right of prescriptive possession. Neither did title pass to the Plaintiff's father in the

Final Partition decree entered in 1969.

Though an issue on prescription was raised by the Plaintiff as the 4th issue, there is no

starting point that has been established by the Plaintiff. It is trite law that where a

party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to

defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of

proof rests squarely and fairly on his or her to establish a starting point for acquisition

of prescriptive rights ~ see Sirajudeen and two others v. Abbas (1994) 2 Sri LR. 365 at

370. A facile story of receiving rubber replanting subsidy at different times cannot

found a claim for prescription on such scant material and the District Judge's

affirmative answer to issue No.4 is not supportable having regard to the facts that have

emerged in the case.

In the circumstances the prescriptive possession has not been established at all. Nor

has title been established by the Plaintiff.

Identity of Corpus

No doubt as His Lordship Justice Marsoof stated in Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef v.

Abdul Majeed Mohamed Mansoor20l0 2 Sri LR. 333:~

7

"To succeed in an action rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a balance of probabilities, not

only his or her ownership in the property, but also that the property exists and is clearly

identifiable. The identity of the land is fundamental for the purpose of attributing ownership,

and for ordering ejectment."

A better part of the argument before me also focused on the identity of the corpus. The

Counsel for the Plaintiff/ Respondent argued that the land was known as

Kethikanadeniya Owita, whilst the Counsel for the Defendant/Appellants contended

that the subject matter was indeed Kethikanadeniya Kumbura and not Owita. In fact

the contention of the Defendant/Appellants is that the subject/matter in dispute is

constituted by Lots 16 to 20 of a land called and known as Kethikanadeniya Kumbura

and in an extent of A I/RO/PI6, as depicted in Plan No 139.

The 2nd witness for the Plaintiff was a surveyor called Mendis who submitted Plan

No.2330 marked as X on behalf of the Plaintiff. In the course of his evidence, he

admitted that what he surveyed was the land surveyed by the Defendant's surveyor

Gallage. Thus it puts paid to any controversy on the identity of corpus but in the view

I have taken of the fact that the Plaintiff has failed prove title to the land he has filed

this rei vindicatio action for, I need not get into the nitty gritty of whether the land was

an Owita or a field (Kumbura) in view of the fact that the Plaintiff has not established

his title to the land that he has claimed as his own.

In the circumstances the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Balapitiya dated 05.07.1999 is set aside and I allow the appeal of the Appellants and

dismiss the action filed by the Plaintiff/Respondent.
