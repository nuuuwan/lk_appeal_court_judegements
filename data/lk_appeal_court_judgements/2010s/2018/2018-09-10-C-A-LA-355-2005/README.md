Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant in the

District Court of Colombo on 12.03.2004 seeking a declaration

that Deed No. 185 dated 06.02.1994 by which the defendant is

alleged to have got title to the land in suit is a fraudulent Deed.

The defendant filed the answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiff's

action (instituted more than ten years after the execution of the

said Deed) inter alia on the basis that the alleged cause of action of

the plaintiff on the face of the plaint is prescribed in law and the

plaintiff has not complied with section 44 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

A few days before the case was to be taken up for trial, the plaintiff

moved to amend the plaint (a) to say that she came to know about

the execution of the alleged fraudulent Deed around December

2001 and then (b) to claim exemption from the law of prescription

in terms of section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The plaintiff in the original plaint did state the date of execution of

the Deed but did not state when she came to know about the

execution of the same. Nor did she claim exemption from

prescription as contemplated in section 44 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

The application for amendment makes it abundantly clear that the

cause of action as it stood in the original plaint was ex facie

prescribed, for otherwise there was no reason for the plaintiff to

expressly plead exemption from the law of prescription in the

amended plaint.

This application for amendment was objected to by the defendant,

but the District Judge overruled that objection and accepted the

amended plaint by order dated 31.08.2005. It is against this order

the defendant has preferred this appeal with leave obtained.

When this case came up before me for the first time on 29.08.2018

counsel for both parties agreed Judgment being pronounced by me

on the written submissions already filed of record.

"An action for declaration that a notarially executed Deed is null and

void is prescribed within 3 years of the date of execution of the Deed

in terms of section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance." (Ranasinghe v.

De Silva1)

However, when a plaintiff seeks cancellation of a notarially

executed Deed upon concealed fraud, the three year period begins

to run not from the date of execution of the Deed but from the time

of the discovery of the fraud, or from the time the party defrauded

might by due diligence have come to know of it. (Kirthisinghe v.

Perera2, Dodwell & Co. Ltd. v. John3)

Under section 93(1) of the Civil Procedure Code the Court has the

full discretion to allow or disallow any application for amendment

of pleadings if it is made before the day first fixed for trial of the

action. However this discretion cannot be exercised arbitrarily or

capriciously, but judicially, guided by time-tested principles

enunciated by the Superior Courts in an array of decisions.

One such principle is that an amendment "which has the effect of

taking the action out of the provisions governing the limitation of 1 (1976) 78 NLR 500 2 (1922) 23 NLR 279 3 (1915) 18 NLR 133 (SC) and (1918) 20 NLR 206 (PC)

4

actions in the Prescription Ordinance or any other enactment of law"

shall not be allowed (Lebbe v. Sandanam4, Sherman de Silva & Co.

Ltd. v. Ariyalatha de Silva5), particularly, if it causes grave

prejudice to the opposite party. Needless to say that an

amendment which shuts out the plea of prescription causes

prejudice to the party who takes up such a plea. This is exactly

what the plaintiff in the instant action did by amending the plaint.

Section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code dictates that: "If the cause of

action arose beyond the period ordinarily allowed by any law for

instituting the action, the plaint must show the ground upon which

exemption from such law is claimed." It is significant to note that

the word used here is not "may" or "shall", but "must" pointing to

the fact that it is mandatory.

The learned District Judge in the impugned order states that as

the plaintiff in paragraph 24 of the plaint has explained the

reasons for the delay, section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code is

satisfied and therefore no prejudice is caused to the defendant by

allowing the amendment. The District Judge has manifestly

misdirected himself on law on that point.

Paragraph 24 of the plaint which the District Judge has referred in

order to allow the amendment does not speak about when the

plaintiff came to know about the execution of the Deed, but the

reasons for the delay in filing the action, which are irrelevant to the

plea of prescription raised by the defendant.

Counsel for the defendant in his written submissions has stated

that, in the circumstances of this case, the District Judge could in

4 (1963) 64 NLR 461 5 (1972) 77 NLR 275

5

terms of section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code return the plaint

for amendment even without any application from the plaintiff.

This submission is clearly untenable in law as paragraph (i) of the

second proviso to section 46(2) expressly states that "When the

action appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any

positive rule of law", "the plaint shall be rejected [not returned for

amendment]; but such rejection shall not of its own force preclude

the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect of the same

cause of action."

The impugned order of the District Judge is set aside and the

appeal is allowed with costs both here and Court below.
