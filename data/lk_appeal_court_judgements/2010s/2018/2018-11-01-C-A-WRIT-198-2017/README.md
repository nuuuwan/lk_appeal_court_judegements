The Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash an entry contained in the (Register of Permits

and Grants under the Land Development Ordinance', annexed to the

petition, marked (AS';

2

2. A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to devolve

on the Petitioners, the property referred to in the said entry 'AS'.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner informed this Court that he would only be pursuing the said Writ of

Certiorari.

The facts of this matter briefly, are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner is the eldest son of Hettiarachchige Don Jayasekara and

Kahandawela Arachchige Leelawathie. After the demise of Leelawathie,

Jayasekara is said to have married Kariyawasam Athukoralalage Jane Nona. The

2nd Petitioner is the eldest son of Jayasekara from this second marriage.

In January 1993, Jayasekara had been issued with a Grant by the State under

and in terms of Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance, in respect

of a land in extent of 0.169 hectares. A copy of the said grant has been

annexed to the petition, marked 'Al'.

In December 2010, Jayasekara had nominated the 3rd Respondent

Sendanayake Arachchige Premaratne as the successor under the said grant

'Al'. It is admitted between the parties that the 3rd Respondent is not a son of

Jayasekara nor is he a blood relative of Jayasekara and appears to be either a

nephew of Jane Nona! or the son of Jane Noni. Be that as it may, the said

nomination, produced with the petition, marked 'A6' has been accepted by the

1 As claimed by the Petitioners and as borne out by the Birth Certificate of the 3rd Respondent, annexed to the petition, marked 'A7'.

2 As claimed by the 3rd Respondent. However, no proof has been adduced in this regard.

Divisional Secretary and has been duly registered in the 'Register of Permits

and Grants under the Land Development Ordinance' maintained by the 1st

Respondent. The relevant page containing the said registration has been

produced with the petition, marked 'AS'.

The Petitionersdo not appear to have had any issue with the aforementioned

nomination of the 3rd Respondent. However, after the death of Jayasekara in

February 2016 and his wife Jane Nona in June 2016, the Petitioners appear to

have claimed title to the said land. In this application filed in 2017, the

Petitioners claim that the nomination of the 3rd Respondent as the successor of

Jayasekara in terms of Section 51 of the Land Development Ordinance is bad in

law as the 3rd Respondent is not a blood relative of Jayasekara. It is in these

circumstances that the Petitioners have sought the Writ of Certiorari to quash

the registration of the said nomination reflected in 'AS'.

The question that arises for consideration by this Court is whether the

nomination of the 3rd Respondent as successor under the provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance is bad in law and if so, whether the Petitioners

are entitled to a Writ of Certiorari to quash the registration of such

nomination.

Provisions with regard to the nomination of a successor are found in Section 51

of the Land Development Ordinance, which reads as follows:

((No person shall be nominated by the owner of a holding or a permit

holder either as his successor unless that person is the spouse of such

4

owner or permit holder or belongs to one of the groups of relatives

enumerated in rule 1 of the Third Schedule"

Rule 1 of the Third Schedule reads as follows:

liThe groups of relatives from which a successor may be nominated for

the purposes of Section 51 shall be as set out in the subjoined table.

Table

i. Sons

ii. Daughters

iii. Grandsons

iv. Granddaughters

v. Father

vi. Mother

vii. Borthers

viii. Sisters

ix. Uncles

x. Aunts

xi. Nephews

xii. Nieces

In this rule, 'relative' means a relative by blood and not by marriage."

5

The 3rd Respondent does not fall into the group of relatives in the Table nor is

he a blood relative of Jayasekara. Hence, in terms of Section 51, the 3rd

Respondent could not have been nominated as the successor of Jayasekara.

The necessary consequence of a nomination that is contrary to Section 51 is

that it is wholly invalid in terms of Section 75, which reads as follows:

"Any nomination of a successor ..... shall be wholly invalid if such

nomination or cancellation in any way contravenes the provisions of this

Ordinance."

Thus, this Court is of the view that the registration of the nomination of the 3rd

Respondent as the successor of Jayasekara was contrary to the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance and that this decision is liable to be quashed

by a Writ of Certiorari. In these circumstances, this Court proceeds to issue the

Writ of Certiorari prayed for in paragraph 'c' of the prayer to the petition. This

Court makes no order with regard to costs.
