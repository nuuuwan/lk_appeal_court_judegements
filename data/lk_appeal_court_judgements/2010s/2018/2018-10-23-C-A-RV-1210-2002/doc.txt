Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 5th defendant-petitioner has filed this revision application

seeking to set aside (a) the Judgment of the learned District

Judge dated 31.01.2001 and (b) the order of the learned District

Judge dated 21.05.2002.

The 5th defendant has not preferred an appeal against the

Judgment. After the Judgment, the Interlocutory Decree has

been entered, and Final Partition Plan has been prepared.

At the Scheme Inquiry, the learned District Judge has refused

the 5th defendant to participate on the basis that the said

defendant has not been allocated any shares in the Judgment.

Further the learned District Judge, ex mero motu, has set aside

some parts of the Judgment delivered by his predecessor which

are in favour of the 5th defendant on the basis of per incuriam.

This in my view is unwarranted. Everybody was satisfied with

the Judgment until that time. Had the learned District Judge

allowed the 5th defendant to participate at the Scheme Inquiry,

the 5th defendant would not have come before this Court

challenging the Judgment. On that basis, I refuse to grant the

first relief of the 5th defendant-petitioner, i.e. to set aside the

Judgment of the District Court.

The learned District Judge in the Judgment has given undivided

72/3456 shares to the 5th defendant subject to establishing the

entitlement to that share later. Even though that finding is

contradictory per se, grave injustice would occur to all the

parties, if this Court is to set aside the Judgment and order trial

de novo on that lapse on the part of the learned Judge.

3

In any event, such an order cannot be made by this Court unless

all the parties are before this Court. The 5th defendant-petitioner

has not taken steps to see that all the parties are properly

noticed before the case is taken up for argument finally for today.

It is also relevant to note that in the proposed Final Partition

Plan No. 4299, the 5th defendants said share has been identified

and left unallotted on behalf of the 5th defendant-vide Lot 6 of the

said Plan. Therefore, whatever it is worth, the 5th defendant had

a right to participate at the Scheme Inquiry.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the order of the learned

District Judge dated 21.05.2002, and direct the learned District

Judge first to hold the Inquiry into the question whether the 5th

defendant is entitled to the undivided 72/3456 share and then to

hold the Scheme Inquiry on the aforementioned proposed Final

Partition Plan.

Application of the 5th defendant-petitioner is partly allowed. No

costs.
