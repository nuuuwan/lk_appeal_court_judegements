COUNSEL Vijith Singh with Chithrananda Liyanage for the Petitioner

Yasas de Silva for the Petitioner-Respondent

M. Shaheem Wazeer for the Respondent

DECIDED ON 09.05.2017

A.H.M.D. Nawaz. J.

Having heard all the counsel in this case and having regard to the submissions

made by Mr. Yasas de Silva who appears for the Petitioner-Respondent namely,

Liyanarachchi Chirantha Prasath the Defendant in DC (Elpitiya) Case No.981/M,

this Court takes the view that the order dated 07.07.2016, and all the directions

contained in the said order of the learned District Judge of Elpitiya in DC 981/M

should be set aside. This Court on 15.12.2016, suspended the aforesaid order dated

07.07.2016, which had ordered a travel ban on the Petitioner. This Court also

suspended the order of the learned District Judge to arrest the Petitioner upon

arrival in Sri Lanka consequent to a civil warrant issued by the learned District

Judge of Elpitiya in his order dated 07.07.2016.

The Registrar of the Court of Appeal has already communicated the orders to the

District Court as well as the Commissioner of Immigration and Emigration,

Battaramulla. Both Counsel for the Petitioner-Respondent Mr. Yasas de Silva and

Ceylon Insurance Corporation Mr. Shaheem Wazeer, have no objections to this

Court making a final order setting aside the order of the learned District Judge

dated 07.07.2016.

In the circumstances, this Court proceeds to set aside the order and the learned

District Judge of Elpitiya is directed to continue with this case by taking steps that

are spelt out in the Civil Procedure Code.

In the circumstances, this application is allowed.
