A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

his is a partition action where the learned District Judge of Badulla delivered

judgment on 23.10.1998. The 8th Defendant who was dissatisfied with the

judgment has preferred this appeal against the judgment to this Court by filing a

Notice of Appeal dated 31.10.1998 which is within 14 days' time limit. The Counsel who

appears for the Substituted~Plaintiff~Respondent and the 2nd Defendant~Respondent

takes up a preliminary objection as follows:~

1 The Notice of Appeal has not been signed by the Attorney~at~law on record; and

2 Even though revocation of proxy had been filed along with the Notice of Appeal,

no leave was obtained from the District Court in terms of Section 27(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

Therefore, he submits that since there is no valid Notice of Appeal, there is no appeal

properly constituted before this Court to hear this matter.

The question that has now arisen before this Court is whether the Notice of Appeal

signed by the Appellant is in order or not.

In terms of Section 27(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, a proxy of a client to appoint a

registered Attomey~at~ Law to make any appearance or application, or do any act shall

be in writing signed by the client and filed in court.

Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code states:~

"when so filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the leave of the court and after notice to the

registered attorney by a writing Signed by the client and filed in court or until the client dies, or

until the registered attorney dies, is removed, or suspended, or otherwise becomes incapable to

act, or until all proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the

client. "

A revocation of a proxy can be effected either by the client or by a registered attorney. If

a registered attorney, for whatever reasons, wishes to discontinue his services to the

client, he may sign a revocation at his office before seeking permission of court.

4

Similarly, if a client chooses to discontinue the services of his registered Attorney~at~

law he could do so with or without the prior permission of court. The contract of

agency is always between the client and the Attorney~at~law and either party is at

liberty to terminate the contract. Hence I take the view that the words "leave of the

Court" in subsection (2) of Section 27 is directory and not mandatory.

What is important is the mutual agreement of the client and the registered attorney for

the revocation. Even if a proxy is revoked without the leave of the court but the

revocation is accepted by court and not rejected there is implicit leave immanent

therein. Only when a fresh proxy is to be filed the revocation becomes necessary and it

must be brought to the notice of court that the previous registered attorney has ceased

to be the registered attorney of the particular party, because there shall not be two

registered attorneys for one party in a civil action at a given time. There should be only

one valid proxy at a time.

In the instant case the proxy that was given to Mr. Prabath Illangathilaka was revoked

and a new proxy was filed along with the Notice of Appeal filed on 02.11.1998. The

objection taken against this procedure is that on 02.11.1998 the new registered attorney

had not signed the Notice of Appeal, but it was signed by the 8th Defendant~Appellant

himself. In my view this cannot be faulted and this cannot be classified as irregular. For

by the time the 8th Defendant filed his Notice of Appeal, on 31.10.1998, the earlier proxy

had been revoked and there was no registered attorney for him.

The revocation of the earlier Attorney~at~law is dated 31.10.1998 and on this date or

thereafter until the new proxy was signed on 02.11.1998, there was no Attorney for the

8th Defendant. In the absence of an Attorney~at~law the Appellant could file the Notice

of Appeal ~Section 755(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The law does not state that the revocation and proxy must be filed in the presence of

the registrar. It only requires the instruments to be filed in the registry. So if the proxy

was signed on 31.10.1998 and was date~stamped on 02.11.1998 it does not vitiate the

appeal. If the court registry date~stamped it two days later, it cannot be construed that

5

the Notice of Appeal was filed on the latter day.

In Nachchiduwa v. Mansoor 1995(2) Sri L.R. 273, the Petition of Appeal was handed

over to the Registrar by the registered attorney on 02.l2.l994. The Registrar placed his

initials and entered the time. According to the practice in the Registry, the petition of

appeal had to be taken thereafter to the record room where it was to be entered in the

Motion Book and filed in the record. These steps were not taken on 02.l2.1994. The

relevant entries were made only on 09.l2.l994, after period of 60 days of the appealable

period had elapsed.

When the Plaintiff made an application for execution of decree pending appeal under

Section 763, his application was allowed and the petition of appeal was rejected on the

ground that it was filed out of time. On appeal against this order, the Court of Appeal

held, inter alia, that:/

1. The act of the registered attorney tendering the petition of appeal to the

Registrar and the act of the Registrar in placing the date stamp and his initials on

the petition of appeal constitute presentation of the petition of appeal.

2. The act of filing the petition of appeal and that of forwarding the record to the

Court of Appeal are official acts of the District Court. Any delay in filing the

petition of appeal in the record cannot be attributed to the Appellant.

Considering the steps taken in the instant case, it appears that the motion and the

Notice of Appeal were both filed on 31.1O.l998 but the court placed the date stamp on

02.11.l998, and therefore the appeal has been filed properly. I see no fault in the

procedure followed in the filing of the Notice of Appeal and the petition of appeal in

this case.

In my view the objection that the Notice of Appeal had been filed on 31.1O.l998 without

obtaining the leave of the Court is unsustainable. It is generally the procedure that after

the filing of the instruments it must be brought to the notice of the court of the change

of the registered attorney and the court permits it by recording it. At what stage the

6

permission of court must be obtained is not stated in Section 27(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

Even in the case of leave to appeal, though the provision states that the leave of the

Court must be first had and obtained, this procedure is followed only after the papers

are filed~see Section S( c) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act, No.54 of 2006. Hence, before filing the revocation and the new

proxy the leave of the Court cannot be obtained and it can be obtained only after the

instruments are filed.

I am, therefore, of the view that the preliminary objection taken against the filing of the

Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal is untenable and is overruled. I allow the

appeal to proceed.
