***********

Accused-appellant IS present In Court produced by the

Prison Authorities.

Heard submissions of both Counsels. The Counsel for the

accused-appellant submits that she is challenging the conviction on the

grounds of identity and non-consideration of the dock statement.

Further, she makes submissions regarding the sentence. During the

submissions Counsel states that the accused was not properly identified

at the trial and there are certain shortcomings in the identity of the

accused. In addition to that, she states that the dock statement has not

been properly considered by the learned trial Judge.

Anyhow, the Counsel submits that this incident alleged to

have happened in 24th October 1995 before the amendment to the

2

Penal Code was brought in. Therefore, the new amendment and the

minimum mandatory sentence will not be applicable to this case.

The Counsel also submits that at the time of the incident, the

accused-appellant was 16 years of age and seeks indulgence of Court

to show mercy on the accused and she seeks a lenient sentence under

the old law.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submits that still the

identity is established even though it is not very satisfactory. Further he

submits regarding the sentence he leaves it in the hands of Court and he

concede to the fact that the accused was of his tender ages and this

case was under the old law. Therefore, there is no minimum mandatory

sentence.

Considering all the factors, specially the incident had happened in

1995 and the accused-appellant was 16 years of age at the time and he

is submitting to Court that he is repenting for the incident that had

happened. We also note that the accused-appellant was absent on many

occasions during the trial and that was the cause of this delay. Anyhow,

considering all material factors, we affirm the conviction and vacate the

sentence imposed by the learned trial Judge and impose the following

sentence:

!t I ! I

3

1. One year rigorous imprisonment on the 18t count and

a fine of Rs.5000/= in default 03 months simple

imprisonment

2. Three and half years ( 3 Y2) rigorous imprisonment on

the 2nd count and fine of Rs. 5000/= in default 03

months simple imprisonment.

Considering the submissions made by both counsel,

we order the both sentences to run concurrently.

The Prison Authorities is hereby directed to implement the

sentence from the date of conviction namely, 23rd July 2015. If the fine

is not paid the default sentence will be operative consecutively.

Appeal regarding the sentence is allowed.
