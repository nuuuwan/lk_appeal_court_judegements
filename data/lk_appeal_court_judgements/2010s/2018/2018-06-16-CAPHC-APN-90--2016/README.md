The Accused-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) has

filed a rev;~jon applir'~tion 1n. th!~ (,(,U1t seeking to revise ,he order ':.'-F !l-.~ r~~:-:-,_,:,:::

Magistrate of Kandy (Case No: 9058) dated 01.04.2016, cancelling the Petitioner's

driving license and to set aside the Order of the Learned Judge of the Central

Provincial High Court of Kandy (HC 28/2016) dated 28.04.2016.

Facts of the case:

The Petitioner was detected on 18.02.2016, by the Police, Kandy when he was

driving a three wheeler at Thannekumbura Kandy after consuming liquor.

Thereafter the Police instituted proceedings against the Petitioner in the Magistrate

court of Kandy for driving a vehicle on the highway after consuming liquor, which

is an offence under section 151(1) read with section 214A, punishable under

section 216 of the Motor Traffic Act as amended. The Learned Magistrate of

Kandy convicted the Petitioner since the Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge at

the commencement of the proceedings and imposed a fine of Rs.7500/= and if , . default a 3 months of simple imprisonment. In addition to that, the Learned

Magistrate cancelled the driving license of the Petitioner, acting under section

216B of the Motor Traffic Act. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 01.04.2016, the Petitioner preferred a revision application to the

Provincial High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy, which was dismissed

by the Learned High Court Judge on the ground that absence of exceptional

circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court. Thereafter the

petitioner filed an application to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

The counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the prosecution has to prove that the

accused had a minimum concentration of .08 milligram of alcohol per 100

milliliters of his blood when a person is charged under section 151 of the Motor

Traffic Act. The Learned counsel further submitted that Breathalyzer Test carried

out by the Police is contrary to the relevant Circular No. 697/87 dated 01.09.1987

issued by the Inspector General of Police and the Regulations made by the Minister

under section 151 of the Motor Traffic Act and published in the Gazette No.45

and dated 13.07.1979.

However we observe that the Learned Magistrate has convicted the Petitioner on

pleading guilty and has mentioned the same in the order dated 01.04.2016.

Therefore we are of the view that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove

that the accused had a minimum concentration of .08 milligram of alcohol per 100

milliliters of his blood. Accordingly we are of the view that the Learned Magistrate

was correct in mentioning only about the green colored crystals in the Breathalyzer

Test tube CPR 1027/16) and it was needless to adhere to the Regulations

aforementioned since the Petitioner had pleaded guilty.

4

However, we wish to consider the mitigatory factors put forth by the Learned

Counsel for the petitioner, i.e. absence of previous convictions against the

petitioner and pleading guilty at the first instance.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel & Others (2004) 1 SLR 284 it was held

that,

"To exercise the revisionary jurisdiction, the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which is beyond an

error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it ...

the order complained of is of such nature which would have shocked the

conscience of the court ... JJ

It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner was convicted under section 151 (1) read

with section 214A, punishable under section 216 of the Motor Traffic Act. Section

151(1) (as Amended) stipulates that,

"(1A) No person shall drive any omnibus or hiring car or any other vehicle

intended for the carriage of persons for fee or reward on a highway after he

has consumed alcohol or any drug.

(J B) Any person who drives a motor vehicle on a highway after he has consumed

alcohol or any drug and thereby causes death or injury to any person, shall be

guilty of an offence under this Act. JJ

Accordingly the Petitioner should have been convicted under section 151 (lA) of

the Motor Traffic Act. Section 216B of the Act specifies the penalties to be

5

imposed on any person who is guilty of the offence of contravening the provisions

of section 151.

Section 216A. Any person who is guilty of the offence of contravening the

provisions of subsection (lA) of section 151 shall, on conviction after summary

trial before a Magistrate, be liable to a fine not less than three thousand rupees

and to imprisonment of either description for term not exceeding six months

and to the cancellation of his driving license.

Section 216B. Any person who is guilty of the offence of contravening the

provisions of subsection (1 B) of section 151 shall, on conviction after summary

trial before a Magistrate, be liable

(a) where he causes death to any person, to imprisonment of either description

(or a term not less than two years and not exceeding ten years and to the

cancellation of his dri)ing licensp:

(b) where he causes injury to any person, to a fine not less than five thousand

rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding five

years or to both such fine and imprisonment and to the cancellation of his

driving license.

Though, the Learned Magistrate has the discretion to cancel the driving license of

any person found guilty in accordance with the aforementioned section, we are of

the view that, in the instant case, the Learned Magistrate has misdirected himself in

cancelling the driving license of the Petitioner under section 216B since no

evidence was produced to prove that Petitioner had caused ,any injury or death to

any person. Therefore the appropriate section to cancel the driving license of the

6

I

I

Petitioner was under section 216A instead of section 216B of the Motor Traffic

Act.

We are mindful of the fact that the Petitioner was employed as a driver and

cancelling the driving license for life time deprives him of a source of income.

Considering the above, we uphold the conviction and vary the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Kandy dated 01.04.2016 by cancelling the driving license of the

Petitioner for a period of two years and six months from 01.04.2016. Accordingly

the driving license can be released to the Petitioner on conditions after two years

and six months from 01.04.2016.

We set aside the order of the High Court of Kandy dated 28.04.2016.

The revision application is hereby allowed.
