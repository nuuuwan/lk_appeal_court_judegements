Plaintiff-Respondent

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena for the Defendant-Petitioner.

Written Submissions on: 19.07.2018

Decided on: 25.07.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

This is a peculiar application filed by the defendant-petitioner

against the plaintiff-respondent for restitutio in integrum for the

limited purpose of restoring her marital status pending

determination of the District Court ongoing inquiry into her

application for setting aside the ex parte divorce judgment which

she alleges to have been obtained by the respondent by fraud

without serving summons on her.

In the first place, if the petitioner thinks that she is entitled to seek

such interim relief pending inquiry, she must first make the

application before the Court where the inquiry is pending and not

before this Court. Even though the petitioner in her written

submissions drawing attention to proceedings of the District Court

dated 28.10.2015 states that the District Court refused to suspend

the decree absolute pending inquiry, I find no such order being

made in those proceedings.

On that ground alone, this application shall be dismissed.

However, for curiosity, let me consider, in brief, why the petitioner

makes this unusual application. At paragraph 4.1 of the written

submissions she gives three reasons. The first one is her inability

to claim maintenance from the respondent. I do not see any dire

need for her to claim maintenance in a desperate great hurry, as,

according to her own evidence, she is employed (and a graduate).

The second one is in the event of the respondent's death pending

inquiry her inability to claim rights of inheritance as the wife of the

respondent. This is highly hypothetical, and in case the respondent

dies pending inquiry her application to set aside the ex parte

judgement will not die. The third one is the likelihood of the

3

respondent contracting another marriage pending inquiry. As per

the proceedings of the District Court dated 28.10.2015 the

respondent has given an undertaking by signing the case record

not to contract another marriage pending inquiry.

There is no legal or factual basis whatsoever for this application.

I unhesitatingly refuse to issue notice on the respondent.

Application is dismissed.
