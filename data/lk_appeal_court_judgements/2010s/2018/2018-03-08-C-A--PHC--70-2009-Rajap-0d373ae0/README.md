JUDGMENT '

" j "

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

Officer in charge police station Meerigama' who has been named as the 1st

Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) has taken the motor car bearing. No. WJ 4898

into custody in connection with a complaint made by the t st Party -

Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter be referred to as the Appellant)

4

against her father in law who has been named as the 2nd Party - Petitioner

- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2,nd Respondent).

It is common ground that the 1st Respondent'(the police) had taken this

motor car into custody from the possession of the 2nd Respondent.

Perusal of the report filed in the Magistrate's Court' by the 1st Respondent

shows that the Appellant had made a complaint to the M~erigama Police

Station to the effect that her husband had gone missing after some people

had abducted him when travelling in the car bearing No. WPJB 4897. The

complaint further states that the 2nd Respondent had ~arted maintaining

and using this car from that time onwards. She has claimed that she is the

registered owner of this car.

The 2nd Respondent in is statement to police has stated that his son

Samanatha Kithsiri had been using this car unti~ he was abducted by some

,< persons. According to him whereabouts of his son is not known. It is his

position that he had started possessing and using it after police had

f handed over the said car to him. It is also his position that it was he who

advanced money for the son to purchase this car.

5

) I It is under those circumstances that the 1st Respondent had reported facts

to the Magistrate's Court.

Both the Appellant and the 1st Respondent had claimed this vehicle in the

Magistrate's Court. Learned Magistrate by his 1 ~t order dated 2008-03-07 , . had ordered that this motor car be handed back to the person from whose

. possession it was taken by the police. He has also stated in his order that it

is not clear as to why the police had taken this vehicle into custody.

Proceedings of this case has commenced after the Appellant made a

complaint to police with regard to a dispute between the Appellant and the

2nd Respondent for the possession of this vehicle. The said complaint has

nothing to do with anyone committing any crime or the relevant vehicle

being used to commit a crime. It appears to be purely a civil dispute to the

ownership of the car between the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent. In

I these circumstances this Court is also of the view (as has been observed by

, the learned Magistrate in his 1st order) that taking thi~ car into custody by

, I "

police is not justifiable. Therefore the learned Magistrate's order that it be

handed back to the person from whose possession it was taken is an

appropriate order. That order should remain valid.

6

Perusal of the report filed by the 1st Respondent in the Magistrate's court

1

shows that the 1st Respondent had taken this car into custody from the

I \ , possession of the 2nd Respondent. Therefbre the 1st Respondent in

. . complying with the order of the learned Magistrate is obliged to hand over

this car to the 2nd Respondent. However what appears from the

proceedings is that the 1st Respondent (police) had handed over the car to

/

the Appellant. This is not in conformity with the order of the Magistrate. . ,

It was under those circumstances that the 2nd Respondent had brought

. that fact to the attention of the learned Magistrate. However learned ,

Magistrate had refused to deal with that.

Once a court of law makes an order it is the duty and the obligation of the

parties to comply with that order. When a non-:-compliance of such order is

.,

.' i ~ brought before Court, the Court has a duty to deal with thafproblem .

..

Learned Provincial High Court Judge also' has held by his order dated 2009-

07-17 that this vehicle be given back to the 2nd Respondent

In these circumstances this Court directs the 1st Respondent (police) to

comply with the learned Magistrate's order dated 2008-03~07 and take all

necessary steps to handover his vehicle to the custody of the 2nd

' Respondent from whose possession the police had taken the vehicle into

custody. For the foregoing reasons this Court decides to dismiss this appeal

without costs.
