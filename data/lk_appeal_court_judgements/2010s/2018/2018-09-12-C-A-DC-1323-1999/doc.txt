The Original Plaintiff (now deceased) instituted the present action by Plaint dated

18.06.1990 against the now deceased 1st and 2nd Defendants seeking, inter alia, a

declaration that the Plaintiff is a co'owner of the land described in the schedule to the

3

Plaint and that he is the owner of the premises and cultivation thereon; ejectment of

the 1st and 2nd Defendants therefrom and to be placed in peaceful possession thereof and

interim injunction preventing the 1st and 2nd Defendants from causing any loss/damage

to the said land and premises.

In the said Plaint it was pleaded, inter alia, that:~

i. one Berakara Gedara Kaluwa being the original owner of the land in suit sold

and transferred same to one Berakara Gedara Ukku on Deed No.12496 dated

05.12.1911 attested by S.M.P. Wijayatilake, Notary Public who in tum

transferred an undivided 112 share each to one Suramba and one Gunaya on

Deed No.11366 dated 20.10.1941 attested by P. De S. Jayawardane, Notary

Public.

ii. the said Gunaya by Deed No. 9144 dated 22.06.1974 attested by A.L

Samarasekera, Notary Public transferred his undivided 112 share to one Asilin

who by Deed No. 9387 dated 04.03.1974 attested by A.L Samarasekera,

Notary Public transferred same to the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff's position therefore is that he had been an owner of an undivided 112 share

in the subject~matter when the 1st and 2nd Defendants unlawfully entered the said Land

and cut down a breadfruit tree. The Plaintiff also pleaded that the said dispute was

referred to the Primary Court of Palapathwela in Case No. 2872 and the 1st and 2nd

Defendants were placed in possession of the subject~matter. The Plaintiff described the

subject~matter of the action as being in an extent of about five nelliess kurakkan sowing.

At the interim injunction inquiry, the 1st and 2nd Defendants filed their Statement of

Objections dated 03.07.1990 and stated, inter alia, that they have no dispute with regard

to the land described in the schedule to the Plaint but that the Plaintiff is in fact

disputing the Defendant's right to the land described in the schedule to the Statement

of Objections which the Defendant claims. The said land of the Defendants is in extent

5 pelas paddy sowing. The Plaintiff later chose not to pursue the application for an

interim injunction ~ vide J.E. No.9 dated 15.01.1991 at page 33.

4

By an answer dated 02.04.1991, the 1st and 2nd Defendants took up the position that

although the Plaintiff was entitled to an undivided Y2 share in the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint, that said land was not possessed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants

but possessed by one Kiripuncha and one Gamini Hemachnadra. The 1st and 2nd

Defendants pleaded that they claim the land described in the aforesaid Statement of

Objections.

At the trial which began on 16.09.1998, six admissions and eight issues were recorded.

It was admitted, inter alia, that the Plaintiff is the owner of an undivided Y2 share of the

land described in the schedule to the Plaint and that the 3rd and 4th Defendants

possessed Lot A of Plan No. 4023 dated 19.02.1998 prepared by M. Rajasekaram,

Licensed Surveyor.

The 1st and 2nd Defendants' position was that the land surveyed by the Court

Commissioner was not the land described in the schedule to the Plaint, but a

completely different land owned and possessed by the Defendants.

Accordingly the main matter for determination is as to whether Plan Nos. 2909 and

4023 depict the land described in the schedule to the Plaint. Therefore the

determination of issue No.3 which reads as follows is crucial to the present action:'

The substituted lA Plaintiff, one Tissa Bulana (Officer of the Primary Court of

Palapathwela) and Murugaiya Rajasekaram, Licensed Surveyor testified marking in

evidence documents PI to P7. The 2nd Defendant testified for the 1st and 2nd Defendants'

case. The 3cd and 4th Defendants did not file an answer, call any oral evidence or tender

documentary evidence.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Matale delivered his

judgment dated 16.07.1999 answering the issues in favour of the Plaintiff and granted

the reliefs prayed for in the Plaint. It is against the said judgment of the learned District

Judge of Matale that the 1st and 2nd Defendants have preferred this Appeal to this Court.

It has to be noted that the Substituted Plaintiffs had been absent and unrepresented

before the Court notwithstanding notices on them.

The main contention of the 1st and 2nd Defendants is that Surveyor Rajasekaram by his

commission plans has failed to depict the land described in the schedule to the Plaint,

but instead depicted the 1st and 2nd Defendants' land. Therefore if judgment and decree

are entered on the basis of the said plans of Surveyor Rajasekaram, the 1st and 2nd

Defendants will be dispossessed from their own land. This has been the argument that

was run before this Court.

This Court bears in mind the settled principle of law that 'in a rei vindicatio action the

burden is on the Plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on by him. The

Defendant need not prove anything" ~see Dharmadasa v. Jayasena [1997] 3 Sri LR. 327.

It is incumbent on the Plaintiff to establish title to the lands depicted in the said Plans

Nos. 2909 and 4023. In fact it was De Kretser J. who stated in Mrs JMA. Morais v.

Mrs F. Victoria 73 NLR 409 at 4417:

"The right to possess (which is one of the rights subsumed in the conception of ownership)

implies the right to vindicate - i.e. to recover possession from a person who possesses without tile

to possess derived from the owner."

In fact the learned Judge further stated that that the cause of action in a re vindicatio

action is the trespass which has resulted in Plaintiff being kept out of property of

which he is the owner, and which may have caused him consequential loss.

Although the Plaintiff pleaded a long pedigree, at the trial the Plaintiff only marked the

deed upon which the Plaintiff purports to have received title ~ i.e. Deed No. 9387 dated

04.03.1974 attested by A.L Samarasekera, Notary Public marked on~see page 238 of

6

the appeal brief. So the corollary follows~ the Plaintiff did not make an attempt to prove

the title pleaded. Some salient points that arise are the following.

i. Although the plaintiff's evidence is that his land extends up to the

Gamsabawa Road to the north, the Gamsabawa Road is in fact to the south of

the land depicted in Plan No. 2909.

ii. The land depicted in Plan No. 2909 is substantially smaller than five nellies

kurakkan sowing and is in fact closer in size to the 1st and 2nd defendant's land.

iii. The boundaries of Plan No. 2909 and the schedule to the Plaint do not tally.

The above salient arguments will be gone into in tum.

Although the plaintiff's evidence is that his land extends up to the Gamsabawa Road to

the north, the Gamsabawa Road is in fact to the south of the land depicted in Plan No.

2909

The schedule to the said Deed marked exl describes a land in extent five nellies

kurakkan sowing. The boundaries in the said schedule are as follows: ~

North ~ by Gangagedera Hena Mala Ela

East ~ by the limit of the filed belonging to Diwalegedera Kaluwa

South ~ by the Agala on the limit of the land belonging to Kahallegedera Kiriya

West ~ by Gamsabawa Road

The Court draws its attention to the Plan No. 2909 at page 242 of the appeal brief.

From the said Plan No. 2909 it is clear that that the Gamsabawa Road is to the south of

the land depicted therein.

The Plaintiff's position in evidence is that Plan No. 2909 depicts his land and that the

land extends up to the Gamsabawa Road to the North. This evidence has to be

contrasted with the testimony of lA Substituted Plaintiff's Evidence in chief at page lOS

and 106 which reads as follows:~

7

"65 C) ~CB G>Ol: erm!mo~ ~,",ks)(':)fID 8C) ~. CoC5tDo

~Ofn 8@d G5 O) ~(5)~ ~) tc;.,en O) OZ;O~ G> C)5 0)0

~~) e~l: oz;o5mc) t~)."

Thus one could see the contradictory positions. The 1A Substituted Plaintiff has taken

up the contradictory position that the Gamsabawa Road is to the west according to the

schedule to the Plaint and Deed marked ex1; that the Gamsabawa Road is to the south

according to Plan No. 2909 marked oz;2 and that the Gamsabawa Road is to the north

in his own evidence at page 106. This does not inspire confidence in the testimony of a

witness who seeks to vindicate title. There is inconsistency per se in the plaintiff's case.

The land depicted in Plan No. 2909 is substantially smaller than five nellies kurakkan

sowing and is in fact closer in size to the 1st and 2nd defendant's land

In Ratnayake and others v. Kumarihamy and others [2002] 1 Sri LR. page 65 at page

81 which was affirmed in appeal ~ [2005] 1 Sri LR. 303 the Court of Appeal and the

Supreme Court set out the schedule by which the old Sinhala land measurements can

be computed by the modern day land measurements. By the said schedule five nellies

kurakkan sowing would approximate to one acre and one rood (A.l R.l P.OO).

However, the land depicted in Plan No. 2909 marked ex2 (page 242) depicts a land

which is only one rood and twenty nine point six zero perches (A.O R.l P.29.60). This

shows that this extent is a little under 1/3 the size of five nellies kurakkan sowing. It was

strenuously contended by Mr. Upendra Walgampaya Counsel for the 1A to ID and 2A

to 2D Substituted Defendant~Appellants that this substantial difference in extent goes

to show that the land depicted in Plan No. 2909 marked ex2 (page 242) is not the land

of the Plaintiff.

8

The attention of Court was also drawn to items 10, 11 and 1lA of the report to the said

Plan No. 2909 which is marked as ot3 (page 244) which reads as follows:~

lO. @ @ID@ COJo~ ~Q>e> (8) ~ e:>es>>e>m Qes> e:>moo e:>es> Cfa>O t;.~~

CQ1e> @t>Q>&5 Iffic.o) ~ es>~ ~~ Cf~ ~~t3S ~ 69.6 d e>.

Thus upon a perusal of the Surveyor's Report marked ot3, it is clear that the tt and 2nd

Defendants' position right throughout was that the wrong land had been surveyed and

the Surveyor himself has noted the substantial disparity in the extents. Surveyor

Rajasekaram confirms this position in his oral evidence~see page 130 of appeal brief.

One has now to contrast the schedule of the 1st and 2nd Defendants' Statement of

Objections at page 79. The said schedule describes the 1st and 2nd Defendants' land as

being in extent one pda paddy sowing. One pda paddy sowing according to modern

measurements is approximately two roods and twenty perches (A.O R.2 0.20). Thus

the argument of Mr. Upendra Walgampaya that this extent is closer to the land

depicted in Plan No. 2909 resonates with the case put forward by the 1st and 2nd

Defendants.

The lA Substituted Plaintiff under cross~examination at page 113 further contradicts

the position with regard to the extent by stating that the Plaintiff's land is only 20

perches. The said evidence which is at page 113 reads as follows:~

c:d -~ @ @ID t;.~~?

ooCSJ~ ct&:> ~.

Upon a consideration of all this evidence, I hold that the Plaintiff has failed to identify

the subject matter properly.

The boundaries of Plan No. 2909 and the schedule to the Plaint do not tally.

Mr. Upendra Walgampaya, the Counsel for the lA to 1D and 2A to 2D Substituted

Defendant-Appellants submitted that the boundaries do not tally in the case and this

adds a further uncertainly with regard to the identity of the subject-matter. Let me set

out the boundaries as set out in Plan No. 2909

North - by Agala

East - by Kahallegedera Kiriya's Agala

South - by Gamsabawa Road

West - by Gangagedera Hena Mala Ela

The aforesaid boundaries do not tally with the boundaries set out in the schedule to the

Plaint. Surveyor Rajasekaram's evidence at page 133 is quite pertinent in this regard.

e -~c:o~ ct~ (5)Z;S~ em. oz;M(tl>oz; B>e) ID @c.oC5 (j)~ en

ct~ Z;M).

It is therefore crystal clear that the directions of the land described in the schedule to

the Plaint do not tally with the land surveyed and that the Surveyor carried out the

survey according to the Plaintiff's wishes. At page 143 he further states that; ") 2009

~O!IrJ ~d ~ CS)l;S~ ~ ~ei)eD CieDlImCi@ ~Q)Cie,)eD ~~ ~ 6)Q>,

~Q~eD cs)l;S~eD em,"

Conceived in the conspectus of the evidence that has transpired in the case, it is quite

apparent that what has been surveyed and depicted in Plan No. 2909 marked ct2 (page

242) is not the land described in the schedule to the Plaint and as is apparent if the

judgment and decree are entered on the evidence, then the Plaintiff would wrongfully

execute the decree against the 1st and 2nd Defendants on the basis of Plan No. 2909

which has wrongly brought in the 1st and 2nd Defendants' land.

In the circumstances I would set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Matale dated 16.07.1999 and allow the appeal. I would proceed to dismiss the Plaintiff's

action with costs.
