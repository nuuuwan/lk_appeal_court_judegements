JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

When this case was taken up for argument on 2017-11-01 learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General at the very commencement raised a preliminary

\

8

objection to the maintainability of this case. It was his submission that the

relief, the Petitioner had sought from this application has been granted as

the 1st to 4th Respondents had conducted and concluded an inquiry in

terms of section 6 (m) of the Common Amenities Board (Amendment) Act.

Learned counsel for the 5th Respondent and the learned counsel for the ]1h

8th and 9th Respondents also associated themselves with the preliminary

objection raised by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General. Court

heard the submissions of all counsel pertaining to the said preliminary

objection and reserved its order and hence the need for this order.

Petitioner in this application has sought" ... a writ of Mandamus directing

the 1st to 4th Respondents to perform the statutory function imposed on the

1 st Respondent by section 6 (m) of the Condominium Management

Authority Law so known by section 3 (a) of the Common Amenities Board

(Amendment) Act No. 24 of 2003 .... " The Petitioner has prayed this writ to

compel the 1st Respondent " .... to resolve the dispute between the

Petitioner as an owner of a condominium parcel and the 6th to the 9th

Respondents as representing the Management Corporation under the said

law by making the necessary orders as to payment of the legitimate dues,

if any, as determined after such inquiry .... "

" 9

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General drew the attention of this Court to

the document produced Marked R 1 which is the report of the inquiry

conducted by the 1st Respondent with regard to the dispute complained by

the Petitioner. 1st Respondent after the said inquiry has come to a finding.

It is at page 13 of the said report.

However it is the contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that

the 1st Respondent had failed to resolve the dispute between the Petitioner

and the 6th to 9th Respondents although it had conducted an inquiry with

regard to the complaint made by the Petitioner.

It is to be borne in mind that the mandate that the Petitioner has prayed

for is a writ of Mandamus. Writ of Mandamus could only be issued to

compel a statutory functionary to perform a statutory duty imposed on him

by law. Indeed the prayer of the Petition is couched in that way. That is

"" .. " .. writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 4th Respondents to perform the

statutory functions imposed on the 1st Respondents by section 6 (m) of the

Condominium Management Authority Law so known by section 3 (a) of the

Common Amenities Board Act No. 24 of 2003 .. "

,,~,

. :"~~ ,i 10

Petitioner has not specified how this Court could compel the Respondents

to resolve the dispute between the Petitioner and the Respondents.

1 st Respondent indeed had conducted the inquiry which the Petitioner had

insisted that the 1st Respondent should conduct. The Petitioner has prayed

for a writ of Mandamus from this Court with a view to compel the 1st

Respondent to conduct that inquiry. As at present, the fact is that the 1st

Respondent has indeed conducted and concluded that inquiry.

The Petitioner has filed this application on 2013-12-10. The report of the

inquiry produced marked R 1 is dated 2016-01-13. Petitioner at no stage

has challenged the findings of this report. This report and the findings

being a decision taken long after filing this application cannot be

considered in this application. It is not open for the Petitioner to challenge

the said findings in this application.

For the foregoing reasons this Court is of the view that there is nothing left

for the consideration of this Court with regard to the application for a writ

of Mandamus.

Writ jurisdiction of this Court is a discretionary jurisdiction.

It appears that the Petitioner is interested in getting this Court to

-'

" ... resolve the dispute between the Petitioner as an owner of a

condominium parcel and the 6th to the 9th Respondents as representing the

Management Corporation under the said law by making the necessary . . ./" ~.~ "'''

orders as to payment of the legitimate dues, if any, as determined after

such inquiry ... "

What the Petitioner at this moment complains is that his prayer in the

following terms namely "to resolve the dispute between the Petitioner as

an owner of a condominium parcel and the 6th to the 9th Respondents as

representing the Management Corporation under the said law by making

the necessary orders as to payment of the legitimate dues, if any, as

determined after such inquiry .... " has not been fulfilled by the 1st to 4th

Respondents.

However the Petitioner has qualified that prayer by the phrase " .... as

determined after such inquiry .... "

As has been stated before, it is a fact that the 1st Respondent has

conducted an inquiry and made a determination. The Petitioner had not

challenged the said determination to date. This Court cannot compel the 1st

12

to 4th Respondents to come to a determination which is favourable to the

Petitioner.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that there is no basis for

this Court to allow this application to be further pending before this Court.

Therefore this Court upholds the preliminary objection raised by the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General and proceed to dismiss this

application without costs.
