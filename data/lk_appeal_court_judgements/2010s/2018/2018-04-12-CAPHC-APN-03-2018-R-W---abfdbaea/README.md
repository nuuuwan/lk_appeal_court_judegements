HIC Colombo HCRA 209/2016

BEFORE: P.PADMAN SURASENA, J (PICA) &

A.L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J

COUNSEL: Muditha Premachandra for the Petitioner.

Supported .. Decided on 29.01.2018.

PI PADMAN SURASENA, 1 (PICA)

At the outset, this court observes that the Petitioner's application is an

application for revision under Article 140 of the constitution. ( Vide the

caption.) This court is of the view that no such power is assigned to this

court by the said Article 140. Be that as it may the Petitioners seems to

2

have filed this application to revise the order dated 05.01.2018

pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Colombo. By

that order the learned Provincial High Court Judge had dismissed the

revision application filed by the Petitioners seeking a revision of the

order made by the Magistrate to evict the petitioners from a state land

under the Provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The said order pronounced by the learned Magistrate has been produced

marked X 1(2). Perusal of that order shows that the learned Magistrate

was satisfied that the Petitioner has no permit or any other legal

authority granted in terms of any law to occupy the said land.

Upon being inquired from this court from the learned counsel who

appeared for the Petitioner in this court ( in the course of her

submissions before this court) she conceded that the Petitioner does

not have any authority or permit issued under any law to occupy this

state land.

3

Section 9 of the said Act has specified the scope of the inquiry to be

conducted in respect of applications made under section 5 of that Act.

Such inquiries have very limited scope. Section 9 only empowers the

court to ascertain whether the occupier to be evicted is in possession

of the relevant land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such

permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid.

This court as well as the supreme Court has in numerous applications

has upheld this legal position. The burden of proof of that fact lies on

that particular person. It is clear that the Petitioner has not discharged

that burden. Learned counsel for the Petitioner also informed this court

that the petitioner had lodged an appeal also to this court against the

order made by the Provincial High Court. Learned counsel for the

Petitioner submitted that the sole ground as to why it was necessary to

file this revision application is to obtain an interim order staying the

enforcement of the learned Magistrate's order.

In view of this circumstances, this court has no legal basis to entertain

this application. Further, this court is of the view that the order dated

2016.11.04 made by the learned Magistrate is a legal order.

It is the view of this court that there is no merit in this application.

Therefore, we refuse to issue notices on the Respondents. Application is

dismissed without costs.

I agree.
