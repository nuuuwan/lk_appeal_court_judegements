The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

was indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura under the following

counts.

1. That during the period from 20th May 2011 to 18th May 2012 the

appellant committed grave sexual abuse on a person named

---- ------- -------~-... - -------------Weerasinghe Arachchilage Dhanuka Prabath Perera, which is an

offence punishable under section 365 (2) b (2) of the Penal Code

as amended.

2. During the same period except the occasion referred to in count

No.1, the appellant committed grave sexual abuse on the said

Weerasinghe Arachchilage Dhany.ka.Prabath Perera, which is an

2

,

offence punishable under section 365 (2) b (2) of the Penal Code

as amended.

3. The during the same period except the period referred to in count

No. 1 and No. 2 the appellant committed grave sexual abuse on

the said Weerasinghe Arachchilage Dhanuka Prabath Perera,

which is an offence punishable under section 365 (2) b (2) of the

Penal Code as amended. . After trial the appellant was convicted and sentenced to a term of 7

years RI and a fine of Rs. 500/= was imposed each for the first and

second counts. He was acquitted on the third count but the High Court

imposed 7 years RI and a fine of Rs. 500/= was imposed for the third

count as well. This appeal is from the said conviction and sentence.

The incident in this case was revealed as a result of a statement

recorded from the appellant in respect of another child abuse complaint

--- - ---- -- - ----.---- - ------ - -- - - -------made aga-inst -the- appeflant. The said complaint was made by-

Prosecution Witness No.2 namely Nelsonge Asanka Diloshini.

The story of the prosecution is that when the victim was studying in

grade 8 or 9, the appellant who was living all alone in her house has

him mounting on top of him. The appellant says that the act of intercourse

took place about 3 - 4 occasions.

Under cross examination the appellant has shifted from the original

position and says that they had sex on a bed in his house where three

other ladies were also sleeping in the same room.

The grounds of appeal urged by the counsel are as follows.

1. Whether the prosecution has established that the offence alleged

have been committed by the appellant, falls within the period

stipulated in the indictment and thereby place no charge to a~swer

by the appellant.

2. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that

___ the cas~_forthe pros~~~tlQD_ d_Q~~_not satisfy thedtest o~_spon!~~_eity.

3. Whether the learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to

consider the evidence favourable to the appellant.

4. Whether the learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that

the evidence of the victim does not satisfy the test of probability.

According to I.P. Roshantha the victim's statement was

recorded onOS.-oS:20tZ (vide page 142 of the brief) and he has

conducted investigation on the directions of his superior officer.

The victim under cross examination admits that he made the

statement to the police two years after the alleged incident (vide

page 82 of the brief). If the victim's evidence is relied upon the first

incident would have occurred on or about 05.05.2010 which falls

outside the time period stipulated in the first count. We find that this

item of evidence has not been considered in favour of the appellant

by the learned High Court Judge.

In view of the above finding of this court the question of

dealing with the rest of the grounds urged by the appellant would

not arise. Therefore we decide to allow the appeal and accordingly

quash the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant.
