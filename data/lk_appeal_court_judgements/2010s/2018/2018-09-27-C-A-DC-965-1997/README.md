The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'Respondent')

instituted this action bearing case number 616/M in the District Court of

Puttalam on 2~h October 1987 against the Defendant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the' Appellant'), claiming damages to the value

of Rs.100, 000/- for loss caused to the Respondent by the Appellant

flinging a bucket of excrement at the house of the Respondent.

The Respondent and his wife gave evidence and stated that on 30.03.1986

morning the Appellant came to his house and spilt a bucket of excrement

and asked the Respondent to eat it. The Respondent further stated that the

Appellant called him with a filthy language and the neighbors rushed to

the scene. He further explained the reasons for the Appellant to commit

this offence as the Appellant's brother-in-law owing some money to the

3

Respondent and the Respondent having had a strong worded conversation

with him sometime prior to this incident.

When the trial is commenced in the District Court, the Respondent and his

wife gave evidence and the brother of the Appellant gave evidence for the

defence, because the Appellant left a Power of Attorney with his brother

and had gone abroad. During the trial the brother of the Appellant denied

all these allegations leveled against the Appellant.

According to the answer filed by the Appellant dated 13.02.1990, he had

denied the claims of the Respondent but did not give any further

explanation as to the incident. However, he stated that this was a

malicious complaint and the Respondent was taking such measures

because he was prevented by the Appellant from stopping the scavengers

taking excrement through a road adjacent to the Respondent's house.

At the end of the trial the learned District Judge pronounced his judgment

dated 08.10.1997 and awarded damages of Rs.100, 000/-to the

Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment this appeal was filed by the

Appellant praying to set aside the said judgment of the learned District

judge dated 08.10.1997.

In this appeal, the Appellant's main averment was that the learned District

Judge has failed to consider and evaluate the evidence led by him; he

further stated that the judge has shifted the burden of disproving the case

on the Appellant and thereby erred in law.

4

However, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that, what the learned

District Judge had said was that the Appellant had failed to provide any

plausible answer to the claims made by the Respondents. The answer filed

by the Appellant (page 64 of the appeal brief) only deny the claim made by

the Respondent but did not give evidence at the trail. His brother giving

evidence (at page 50 of the appeal brief) merely stated that his brother did

not mention to him that he had done the things alleged by the

Respondents and that he did not believe that his brother would do such

thing.

I agree with the Respondent's submission, and I observe that during the

trial the Respondent and his wife gave evidence but the Appellant has

failed to participate or give evidence on behalf of him; the brother of the

Appellant testified as:

" q~J 0' E)0'aJ q9e3 e3S 2lS)CJ ~c.eCJ 2lS)E)i5)JE)l5f C) ~c..5CJ 25)l. q~J

6@ID @~c.ewr 2lS)OS ~c..5Cl5f J e3Szsf 8~(Dzsf@zsf 25)IID1 " (page 50 of the

brief)

Further I observe that, the Appellant has failed to present his defence at

the trial. Therefore, Appellant's aforementioned ground fails.

The Appellant's other averment was that the according to section 40 of the

Civil Procedure Code, Respondent has failed to give a plain and concise

statement of the cause of action or when and where it arose at all. But

when I consider the plaint dated 27.10.1987 that the Respondent stated on

30.03.1986, in front of his door step that the alleged act was done by the

Appellant. The learned District Judge also satisfied with this statement.

Therefore I see no merit in this issue. It is clear law that if the plaint is good

5

in ex facie it can be sustainable; if there are any objection from the

contesting party it must be taken by the answer.

In Actalina Fonseka and Others vs. Dharshani Fonseka and Others (1989)

2 S.L.R. 95 the Supreme Court held that:

"The plaint discloses a cause of action founded on fraud by forging a will

and non-disclosure of heirs. The law does not require that the plaint should

make out prima facie case nor carry the evidence by which the claim would

be proved. Hence the case must be heard"

Kulatunga, J. further held that:

1/ I am of the view that categories of fraud are not closed and that it should be left to

the Court to decide whether any particular contrivance constitutes a fraud on the

Court having regard to the facts and circumstances of such case." If the real

grievance of the defendant-appellant is that the plaint does not contain sufficient

particulars or even in a case where it is alleged that the plaint does not disclose a

cause of action the correct procedure under section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code is to move, before pleading to the merits, to have the plaint taken off the file. "

In Read vs. Samsudin, 1 N.L.R. 292, Bonser, C. J. held that:

It is not the duty of a judge to throw technical difficulties in the way of

administrating justice. He ought to remove them out of the way upon

proper terms as to costs and otherwise.

In a Court of Requests all technicalities of law should be avoided.

When a plaint, defective in some material respect, has been filed, it is not

necessary to move that it be taken off the file, but it is the duty of the court,

6

of its own accord, or upon its attention being called, to reject the plaint or

return it to plaintiff for amendment. If the plaint is good ex facie, any

objection thereto must be taken by the answer.

The Counsel for the Appellant further stated that the Respondent had

failed to prove the quantum of damages suffered by him due to the alleged

incident. To answer this averment, the Respondent stated that he is

seeking damages for the humiliation and mental agony; further stated that

he and his family had suffered due to this incident which is not

quantifiable by the Respondent in any way except by what the Respondent

feels is justified to be claimed. And the Respondent and his wife had

clearly given evidence as the humiliation and mental agony suffered by

them. (at pages 38 to 49 of the brief)

In Mahipala and Others vs. Martin Singho (2006) 2 S.L.R. 272,

Wimalachandra, J. held that:

"The plaintiff can claim compensation not only for the physical injury that

had been occasioned by the accident and its aftermath, but also for the

inconvenience and loss of amenities. This includes the deprivation of the

ability to participate in normal activities in day by day life. This may also

include the deprivation of sexual pleasure, mental suffering and frustration

resulting from the victim's inability to lead a normal life ... " (Page at 279)

Further His Lordship Justice Wimalachandra quoted Mickerron's view

(The Law of Delict, page at 114) as follows:

" ... there are no scales by which pain and suffering can be measured, and

there is no relationship between pain and money which makes it possible to

express the one in terms of the other with any approach to certainly. The

7

usual method adopted is to take all the circumstances into consideration

and award substantially an arbitrary sum. "

In all the circumstances of this case, I observe that the Respondent has a

valid claim; he and his wife gave evidence at the trial and explained the

mental pain and suffering incurred to him by the acts of the Appellant. But

the Appellant never give evidence nor explain his version of defense.

Therefore I see no any merit in this appeal.

For the forgoing reasons, I uphold the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Puttalam and dismiss the appeal. I also award costs in a sum of

Rs. 15,000/- payable to the Respondent by the Appellant.

Appeal dismissed.
