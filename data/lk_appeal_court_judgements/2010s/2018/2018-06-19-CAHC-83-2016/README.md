After trial, the learned High Court Judge has convicted the

Appellant for the said offence and sentenced him for 8 years

Rigorous Imprisonment together with a fine of Rs. 5000/- with a default term of 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment and he was also

ordered to pay Rs. 75,000/- to the victim with a default term of

2 years Rigorous Imprisonment.

When this case was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel

for the Appellant informed Court they are not contesting the

conviction but only the sentence.

Since there is a minimum mandatory sentence which is 7 years

evidence led at the trial, we decide to reduce the sentence to 7

years Rigorous Imprisonment commencing from the

conviction, which is 16.03.2016.
