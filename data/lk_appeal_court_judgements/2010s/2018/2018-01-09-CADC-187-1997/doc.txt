The Plaintiff - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs) instituted

action in the District Court of Kegalle by Plaint dated 26.07.1972 against the 1 st

-10th Defendants to partition the land more fully described in the Plaint.

Thereafter, the 11 th -13 th Defendants were added as necessary parties to the

action.

The ih, 8th and 9th Defendant - Respondents and the 10th Defendant - Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) filed their joint statement of claim

dated 21.02.1974 seeking inter alia a dismissal of the Plaint with costs.

When this case was taken up for trial on 06.05.1987 no admissions were

recorded by the parties and issue Nos. 1 - 3 were raised on behalf of the

Plaintiffs, issue Nos. 4 - 10 were raised on behalf of the ih, 8t\ 9th and 10th

Defendants, issue Nos. 11 -16 were raised on behalf of the 11 th and 1 i h

Defendants. Thereafter, the evidence of the 2nd Plaintiff was led.

However, when the learned District Judge who took up trial was transferred the

parties did not agree to adopt the evidence of the 2nd Plaintiff before the new

: I I I I

I "\

trial Judge. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge directed that new Issues be

framed and ordered to commence a fresh trial on 09.02.1989.

Accordingly, on 09.02.1989 issue Nos. 1 - 6 were raised on behalf of the

,-Plaintiffs, issue Nos. 7 -13 were raised on behalf of the 7th, 8th , 9th and 10th

Defendants, issue Nos. 14 - 19 were raised on behalf of the 11 t\ 1ih and 13A

Defendants.

It is clear that the learned District Judge by Judgment dated 24.03.1997 has

answered the original issues, numbered 1 - 16 framed on 06.05.1987 and has

not considered issue Nos. 1 - 19 which were framed on 09.02.1989.

This Court finds that the issues on which the original partition action ought to

have been decided were those which were framed on 09.02.1989. However, as

the learned District Judge has failed to address her judicial mind to the issues

framed at the commencement of the fresh trial and has failed to evaluate the

evidence presented at trial in light of these issues the said judgment is

manifestly wrong.

Therefore we set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge dated

24.03.1997 and order re trial.

Considering the time exhausted on the matter in dispute the learned District

Judge is directed to hear this matter expeditiously giving priority to this case.
