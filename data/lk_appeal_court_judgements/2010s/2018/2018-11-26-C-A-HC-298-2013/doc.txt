JUDGMENT

s. Thurairaja, PC. J

The Accused - Appellant, Arjunan Vinod Raju alias Ramesh (Hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellant), it is noted that the indictment and the petition of

appeal has different names. It is also observed that the written submissions and the

motions filed in the Court of Appeal have different names. For all purpose we use the

name as appeared on the indictment as well as the evidence before the trial court.

The Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo by the honourable

Attorney General on four (4) counts. On the 13th of July 2006 at Bloemendhal Road,

Colombo, the Appellant had possessed less than 1 gram of Heroin (dicetyl morphine)

and trafficked the same which is punishable under Section 54 A (b) and 54 A (d) of

the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act. In the same indictment the Appellant

also indicted for possession and trafficking of 6.36 grams of Morphine which is

punishable under Section 54 A (b) and 54 A (d) of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act.

Trial was held before the High Court and prosecution led the evidence of Inspector

of Police (IP) Mahinda Gamlath Welagedara, Kodikara Arachchilage Lal Kumara,

Government Analyst Pathirage Sandya Kumari and Inspector of Police (IP) Virath

Buddhika Gunasekara.

After the trial the Appellant was convicted and sentenced to 7 years rigorous

imprisonment each on the 1 st and 2nd count together with Rs. 50,000/- fine on each

count and in default 1 year simple imprisonment. For the 3rd and 4th counts the

Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and sentence the Appellant had preferred

this appeal to the Court of Appeal and submitted following grounds of appeal (the

following are re-produced from the written submission of the Accused-Appellant).

1) Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by not considering the

improbabilities of the narration of the Police Officers which cast a

reasonable doubt on the prosecution version.

2) Learned High Court Judge misdirected by failure to evaluate the dock

statement in proper context and thereby caused a miscarriage of justice.

3) Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to consider that

the chief investigation officer had not entered notes on very material

instances in the course of the raid and that creates a reasonable doubt on

the version of the prosecution case.

4) Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to consider that

the dock statement very clearly corroborates the version of the defence

suggested to the prosecution witnesses and thereby cast a reasonable

doubt on the prosecution version.

5) Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by not considering the

material inter se contradiction which casts a doubt on the prosecution

version and its credibility.

It will be appropriate to consider the facts of the case before we proceed to analyse

grounds of appeal.

According to the prosecution witness, IP Mahinda Gamlath Welagedara attached to

the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB), his junior officer PC Lal had received an

information from his personal informant regarding trafficking of heroin. They formed

a team and organized a raid. They left around 12.30, laid in ambush and arrested the

Appellant with narcotic substance.

The Counsel for the Appellant supported the 1 st, 3rd and 5th grounds of appeal. The

Counsel submitted that there is a discrepancy regarding the 1 st information of which

the Learned Trial Judge had not considered. According to Police Constable (PC)

Kodikara Arachchilage Lal Kumara, he received an information, that a person called

Naseer is coming with drugs to be given to Ramesh and he in turn to distribute

among his customers. But the Senior Officer when giving evidence said that Ramesh

is coming there to distribute drug among the customers. The Counsel submits that

the name of Naseer is not stated by the team leader. Therefore he submits that there

is a serious discrepancy in their evidence.

We carefully perused the evidence led before the trial judge and find that there is a

clear mention about the Accused-Appellant and the involvement in the transaction.

The officers and the informant who were involved in the raid had clearly identified

the Appellant. The person who supplied drugs to the Appellant is not a fact in issue

in this case. Therefore we do not see any discrepancy in the evidence before the trial

judge hence we find there is no merit in this case.

The 2nd and 4th grounds of appeals deal with the dock statement. The counsel for the

Appellant submits that the dock statement was not properly considered. It will be

appropriate to know how the proceedings were held before the trial judge. The

Appellant was present throughout the trial. When the case for the prosecution was

closed and defence called the Appellant made a dock statement and informed Court

that he will be calling witnesses on his behalf. But suddenly he avoided appearing in

Court. He never called any witnesses on his behalf. Therefore the Learned Trial Judge

had to consider only the Dock Statement of the Appellant. This does not mean that

the Appellant is expected to prove his innocence. I only mentioned what had

happened before the trial judge.

The Appellant made a short dock statement. In his dock statement, the Appellant

said that he did not have heroin in his possession. It was found elsewhere and they

took me from home. Thereafter they filed this case. I was assaulted after taking to the

Police Station. They assaulted and inquired "whose is this?", I told "I do not know".

Thereafter they filed the case on me. (almost direct translation of the dock

statement).

We re-produce the said Dock Statement for completeness .

The Learned Trial Judge has advised himself regarding how to handle a dock

statement. Further being judicially trained minded judge has given due consideration

for the dock statement. It appears he had clearly accepted the statement as evidence

and considered the truthfulness, veracity, probability and relevance of the dock

statement. After carefully considering he had rejected the said dock statement.

Acceptance of Dock Statement is discussed in many cases.

In Gunasiri and two other vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 (1) Sri L.R 39. It was held

that,

In evaluating a dock statement the trial judge must consider the following

principles:

(7) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

(2) If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case

the defence must succeed.

(3) Dock statement of one accused should not be used against the other.

In The Queen v. Kularatne [1968] [71 NLR 529] stated that,

"we are in respectful agreement, and are out of the view that such a statement

must be looked upon as evidence subject to the infirmity that the accused had

deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony".

The charges against the Appellant are possession and trafficking of heroin (dicetyl

morphine). Further the 3rd and 4th counts are for possession and trafficking of

,

, I

morphine. When we consider the dock statement, there he had denied only

possession of heroin. He had not denied or replied to 3rd and 4th counts in the

indictment. Therefore there is no express denial presented by the Appellant other

than pleading not guilty to the charges.

Considering the above circumstances it is the duty of the trial judge to consider the

evidence presented by the prosecution.

Considering the grounds of appeal submitted by the Learned Counsel for the

Appellant in his written submissions was reduced to the above two grounds of

appeal at the time of the argument. We carefully considered all grounds of appeal

and the submissions made by the counsel. For the purpose of completeness, we

considered all grounds of appeal stated in the written submission. We find that there

is no merit on all grounds of appeal submitted by the Appellant. Accordingly we

dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed. Conviction and sentences are affirmed.

Appeal Dismissed.
