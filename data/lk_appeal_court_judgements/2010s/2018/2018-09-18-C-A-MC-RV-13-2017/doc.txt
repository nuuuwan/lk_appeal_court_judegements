fully described in the application filed under State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 as amended.

g. To grant costs.

The sequence of events that paved the way for this application is as follows;

1. As per the amended Petition, the Applicant Petitioner (hereinafter called and

referred to as the Petitioner) filed an application under and in terms of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 as amended, against

the Respondent- Respondent (herein after called and referred to as the

Respondent) to recover the land and premises more fully set out in the said

application marked as P1 with the Petition.

2. The Respondent filed the statement of objection and/or show cause marked

as P2 with the Petition.

3. After considering the written submissions (P3 and P4) filed by both the

parties, the learned Magistrate of Hatton made an order in favour of the

Petitioner ejecting the Respondent. (vide P5)

4. As per the petition, this order was carried out and the Respondent was

ejected from the aforesaid land and premises

5. The Respondent filed an application for Revision in this court to set aside the

said order of the learned Magistrate and this court set aside the said order

of the learned Magistrate. The Petitioner's application to the Supreme Court

was withdrawn by the Petitioner.

6. Meanwhile Watawala Plantation Ltd, the Lessee of the Petitioner filed an

action in the District Court of Hatton as there is a Deed issued by the Land

Reform commission in favour of the wife of the Respondent.

7. The Respondent moved Magistrate's Court of Hatton to issue a writ to

restore the possession of the said land and premises to him, and after

hearing the oral submissions of both the parties, the learned Magistrate

made order dated 23.06.2017 marked as P9, placing the Respondent in

possession of the said land and premises.

8. The Petitioner filed this Application against the said order dated 23.06.2017.

4

As per the written submissions tendered, pending this application and the District

Court case, the Respondent was put back in possession of the said land and

premises as a result of the order marked P9 made by the learned Magistrate.

Since the order which ejected the Respondent and placed the Petitioner in

possession of the said land and premises was set aside by this court by its order

dated 28.06.2016 marked as P6F and the Special leave to Appeal application was

withdrawn by the Petitioner, the order of this court setting aside the order of the

learned Magistrate marked PS is the valid order with regard to the application filed

by the Petitioner under the State Land (Recovery of Possession) ordinance.

Hence the order ejecting the Respondent from the said land and premises by the

Magistrate is not valid. Further, the placing of the Petitioner in possession of the

said land and premises is not based on a valid order. In other words, the learned

Magistrate placed the petitioner in possession on the strength of an invalid order.

Magistrates' courts or any court has inherent power to repair the injuries done by

its Act. (see Jane Nona Vs Jayasooriya (1986) 1 CALR 31S.Sirinivasa Thero vs.

Saddassi Thero 63 NLR 31) A court whose Act has caused injury to a suiter has an

inherent power to make restitution. This power is exercisable by a court of original

jurisdiction as well as by the Supreme Court (see Sivapathalingam Vs

Sivasubramaniam (1990) 1 SLR 378).

It is not relevant whether the respondent prayed for restoration in his application

to revise the order of the learned Magistrate dated 09.08.2012 marked as PS. As

per the said application marked P6A, the Respondent had prayed for a stay order

restraining the Petitioner from taking steps to eject him from the premises. This

indicates that at the time the said application was filed in this court, the ejection of

the Respondent had not taken place. It should be noted that the Petitioner has not

revealed the date of ejection of the Respondent from the premises after the order

marked PS which was vacated by this court.

5

However, the Magistrate's Court order marked as P9 dated 23.06.2017 is an order

that repairs the injuries caused by its Act based on an invalid order.

I do not see that there is any ground for a successful case for the Petitioner. Hence,

I dismissed this application without issuing notice on the Respondent.
