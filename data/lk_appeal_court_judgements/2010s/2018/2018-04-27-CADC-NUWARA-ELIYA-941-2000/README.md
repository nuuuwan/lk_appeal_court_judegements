y a plaint dated 10.06.1993 the Plaintiff,Respondents (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the Plaintiffs") filed this rei vindicatio action against the

Defendant'Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant")

praying for a declaration of title to the lands described in the 1st and 2nd schedules

to the plaint, ejectment of the Defendant, his agents, servants and others holding

under him from the land morefully described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint and

damages in a sum of Rs.2,500r permensem with effect from 15.03.1993.

The Defendant filing his answer dated 16.05.1995 sought a dismissal of the action

of the Plaintiffs whilst praying for prescriptive title to the land described in the

schedule to answer, which he averred he had been in possession since 1983. The

Plaintiffs counter,claimed by his replication dated 04.06.1996, praying for a

dismissal of the Plaintiffs' claim.

The vindicatory action of the Plaintiffs is based on PI'an order confirming a fiscal

sale under the hand of the District Judge of Nuwaraeliya, which passed title to the

father of the Plaintiffs Wahalawatte Hemapala Gunatileke of a property as

depicted in PI. The fiscal sale had taken place on 11.06.1970. The father bought this

property morefully described in PI which was in an extent of 25.75 perches.

This order of confirmation of sale marked PI and bearing the signature of the

District Judge describes the land that the father of the plaintiffs Wahalawatte

Hemapala Gunatileke bought at the fiscal sale as "all that divided and specific

portion of Agra Ovuha Bazaar (being a portion of Lot G depicted in Plan No.870 dated

06.03.1956 made by T.I.A. Anandappa Licensed Surveyor also depicted in Plan

No.956 dated 04.05.1953). The father later conveyed the land to his two sons for a

consideration of Rs.40,000/~ on 21.01.1990.

As the learned Counsel for the Defendant~ Appellant contended, the schedules in

PI (what the father got in PI) and in P2 (what the father conveyed to the Plaintiffs

in P2) differ materially in that the southern boundaries to the land described in

both schedules are not the same. It is observed that even the southern boundary

described in the 1st schedule to the plaint to which the Plaintiffs seek vindication

of title differ from the southern boundary of the land described in the deed

conferring title on the Plaintiffs (P2). This leads me to the conclusion that the

identity of the corpus of the land to which the Plaintiffs seek vindication has not

been established satisfactorily and the discrepancies have not been explained at all

at the trial. In fact the power of attorney holder giving evidence did not give a

sufficient explanation as to how the discrepancy between the schedules in PI and

P2 could be reconciled.

Moreover, even the land depicted in the tt schedule to the plaint bears a different

southern boundary that remains unexplained. In the circumstances I am

irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the identity of the land as depicted in the tt schedule to the plaint to which the Plaintiff seeks a vindicatory title has not

been established. It is trite law that the identity of the property with respect to

which a vindicatory action is instituted is fundamental to the success of the action

as the proof of the ownership (dominion) of the owner (dominus)~see the

observation of Marsoof J. in Amaldeen Abdul Latheef v. Abdul Majeed

Mohamed Mansoor and Another (2010) 2 Sri LR 333.

If the subject~matter of an action to which a Plaintiff seeks a vindicatory title is

erroneously described in the schedule to the plaint, it has to be rectified by an

amended plaint filed with the permission of Court and a duty is cast upon the

Plaintiffs to explain the grounds for omission of the correct boundary and

identification of property to enable the Court to give him the declaration which he

has sought. In fact, the Counsel for the Plaintiff~Respondents, when he was

confronted with the issue of identification of the land sought to rely on an answer

given by the Defendant at the trial where the Defendant admitted in a question by

Court that the subject~matter of a previous 66 application and the instant civil

action was the same ~ vide p.67 of the appeal brief.

This admission, in my view, cannot create an estoppel as the primary Court in the

66 application would not have gone into title of the Plaintiffs and it was possible

that whoever had dispossessed the Plaintiffs, if they were the complainants in the

66 application, could have possessed more or less of the corpus of the rei vindicatio

action. Therefore, the admission as to the subject~matter of the 66 application

cannot be a substitute for the duty of the Plaintiffs in a rei vindicatio action to

establish the identification of property unless the corpus in this case was

identified as the corpus in the 66 application. In the absence of such an

identification, I take the view that as the identity of the corpus has not been

established to the satisfaction of Court, I proceed to allow the appeal and set aside

the judgment dated 06.12.2000.
