ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an appeal by the accused-appellant against his conviction on a charge of murder and imposition of a sentence of death by the High Court at Tangalle.

There are no eye witnesses to the incident to which the deceased has

sustained a stab injury on the upper abdomen. The prosecution relied on the

evidence of one Rotumba Arachchige lasing to establish that the deceased person

was last seen in the company of the accused-appellant. This witness also testified

to the fact that the deceased has made a dying declaration implicating the

accused-appellant as the person who stabbed him. The prosecution also relied on

the evidence of Koggala Liyanage Ranjith who also claimed that the deceased

made a statement.

In support of the appeal, learned Counsel for the accused-appellant

submitted that the trial Court was in error as;

i. it has acted on the evidence of an unreliable witness lasing,

11. it failed to note that the death of the deceased was not proved

by the prosecution,

111. it failed to note that the date of offence also was not proved by

the prosecution,

IV. it has erroneously imposed an evidentiary burden on the

accused appellant.

It was contended in relation to the 1st ground of appeal that the witness

lasing in his examination in chief said that the deceased did not name the person

2

who stabbed him and strangely after an adjournment of proceedings, and in

resuming his evidence, he has claimed that one jayantha has told him that the

deceased made a statement that" Uluwatte Punchi Aiya" has stabbed him. He also

claimed that the deceased repeated the accusation when he enquired from him as

to the person who stabbed him.

The accused-appellant submitted that the prosecution did not call jayantha

and, in addition, an omission was marked on this claim that in his statement to

the Police witness jasing did not mention that jayantha told him that "Uluwatte

Punchi Aiya" has stabbed him. The learned Counsel also submitted that jasing

identified the accused-appellant as "Uluwatte Punchi Malli" and not as "Uluwatte

Punchi Aiya". The accused-appellant also marked a contradiction on the evidence

of jasing that the deceased left his chena with "Punchi Mahatmaya" at the non-

summery proceedings as VI.

The accused-appellant contended that, in view of these infirmities and

inconsistencies, the evidence of jasing becomes unreliable and infirm.

In relation to the 2nd and 3rd grounds of appeal, it was contended by the

learned Counsel for the accused-appellant that the evidence only relates to the

death of a person called "Munupura" and there was no evidence placed before

the trial Court by the prosecution to establish the fact that the post mortem

report marked as PI is in fact in relation to the deceased.

The 4th ground of appeal was based on the contention that the trial Court

has shifted an evidentiary burden on the accused-appellant in holding that it was

up to him to establish that the deceased was unable to make the alleged

3

utterances and also it was for him to establish the fact that the deceased was

unable to speak due to the reason that he lost blood rapidly.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent,

contended that reference to layantha in the evidence of lasing was in fact a

reference to the 2nd prosecution witness Kongala Liyanage Ranjith. He further

submitted that lasing was a reluctant witness due to the threats and after the

adjournment, he has decided to give a truthful account of the sequence of events.

In relation to the identity of the deceased, it was submitted that there was ample

evidence by which it could safely infer that the death of the deceased and his

identity.

Considering the evidence of the prosecution and the several grounds of

appeal raised by the accused-appellant, it is convenient to deal with them in

consideration of the evidence of the prosecution in its totality.

Upon perusal of the evidence of witness lasing it is clear that he was

deliberately suppressing certain items of evidence even after the adjournment,

which apparently reassured him of some protection. The witness provided an

explanation for his reluctance to give evidence attributing it to fear he

entertained due to threats by two unidentified persons. The alleged threatening

occurred after about two months from the date of incident while the accused -

appellant was still in remand. He claimed that although he was threatened by

two unidentified persons, he did not lodge a complaint. Having admitted that he

told the .truth at the Magistrate's Court, he stated that he is still under the same

apprehension even after 12 to 13 years. Then he claimed that he need not fear in

giving evidence. In re-examination, the witness admitted that he has lied before

4

the Magistrate's Court as he was told not to reveal that it was "Punchi Aiya". He

further claimed that the deceased addressed the accused-appellant as II Punchi

Aiya" but he would call him II Punchi Malli".

It is also observed that although lasing claims that it was PW2 who told

him of the claim that II Punchi Aiya" stabbed the deceased, Ranjith in his evidence

contradicted this claim. According to Ranjith the deceased made the statement on

their way to the hospital in a three wheeler. Ranjith also claims there was a II Podi

Malli" among the group of people who gathered after the incident near the place

where the deceased lay fallen and the person known to him as "Punchi Aiya"

who had been discharged from the hospital that very morning and subsequently

died. He did not give any evidence connecting the accused-appellant with the

incident.

In addition, lasing maintained that he does not keep any illicit brew at his

chena, but Ranjith contradicted him with his evidence that both lasing and the

deceased were engaged in the illicit liquor trade.

The claim of lasing that PW2 told him of the statement made by the

deceased is not a consistent assertion, in view of the omission highlighted by the

accused-appellant on a very vital point, coupled with the fact that Ranjith was

silent on this aspect in his evidence. Therefore, the claim that lasing learnt from

PW2 that II Uluwatte Punchi Aiya" has stabbed him becomes unreliable.

Then the other assertion of lasing that the deceased told him that II Uluwatte

Punchi Aiya" has stabbed him has to be examined for its truthfulness and

relia bili ty.

5

According to lasing the deceased made this statement at the place where he

lay fallen and the witness has no clear recollection whether the deceased did

speak on his way to the hospital or not. This evidence is again contradicted by

witness Ranjith who clearly states it was on their way to hospital the deceased

has made the statement.

The contradiction marked as V1 adds another aspect. According to the

contradiction, lasing saw the deceased leaving his chena, with one "Punchi

Mahatmaya" whereas his evidence before the trial Court was that he left with

"Uluwatte Punchi Malli" and he would not address the accused-appellant as

"Punchi Mahatmaya". This is a vital contradiction on the evidence of this witness

as it related to the identity of the person who accompanied the deceased that

evening" but there was no effort was made to clarify this inconsistency by the

prosecu tion.

In Ranasinghe v Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 218, it was held that;

"When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence

against an accused person in a criminal trial the trial Judge or the junj

as the case may be must bear in mind following weaknesses.

(a) The statement of the deceased person was not made

under oath.

(b) The statement of the deceased person has not been

tested by cross examination; vide King v Asirivadam

Nadar 51 NLR 322 and ]ustinpaZa v Queen 66 NLR

409.

6

(c) That the person who made the dying declaration is not

a witness at the trial.

In addition, the Court of Appeal further held that;

/I As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying declaration ... the trial Judge or the

jury as the case may be must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the following

matters.

(a) Whether the deceased, in fact, made such a statement.

(b) Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and

accurate.

(c) Whether the statement made by the deceased person could

be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

(d) Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the

dying declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

(e) Whether witness is telling the truth.

(j) Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the

alleged declaration was made."

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant tendered the unreported

judgment of C.A. 21/2003 of CAM 13.09.2005 where a similar view was

adopted.

These six matters had to be considered by the trial Court, before it

proceeds to evaluate the truthfulness and reliability of the" dying declaration"

made by the deceased as per the three weaknesses of such statements as

reproduced above.

7

When the infirmities of the evidence of Jasing referred to above paragraphs

are considered in detail, in the light of the above considerations, it is clear that

the submission of the accused-appellant that the trial Court has fallen into error

when it acted on the unreliable evidence of the said witness had merit as it is

clear his evidence is unworthy of any credit. If the evidence of Jasing becomes

unreliable, then there is no connection established between the deceased and the

accused-appellant by the prosecution. The prosecution had to establish "the

evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying declaration could be accepted beyond

reasonable doubt". The prosecution has clearly failed in this task.

This Court is mindful that credibility of a witness is clearly a question of

fact and an appellate Court would be reluctant to interfere with a finding of fact

by a trial Court, in view of the priceless advantage it had in observing the

demeanour and deportment of the witnesses. In the judgment of Fradd v Brown

& Co. Ltd., (1915) 18 NLR 302 at 304, Wood Renton C,J. has held that;

"The House of Lords, in Montgomery v. Wallace-James [(1904) A.

C. 73.}, has pointed out the weight that is due in all matters affecting

the credibility of witnesses to the decision of the tribunal which has

had the advantage of seeing and hearing them, and there are

innumerable-local judgments to the same effect. But it must be

remembered that the law gives to litigants in this Colony a right of

appeal, such cases as the present, against the finding of the court of

first instance, even on questions of credibility, and in Khee Sit Nob v.

Lim Thean Teng [(1912) A. C. 323.} the Prilly Council, while

affirming the general rule above mentioned, was careful to explain that

it would not be applicable where, in deciding between witnesses, the,

trial Judge had clearly failed on some point to take account of

8

particular circumstances or probabilities material to an estimate of the

evidence, or had given credence to testimony, perhaps plausibly put

forward, which turned out on further analysis to be substantially

inconsistent with itself or with indisputable facts. The Supreme Court

of this Colony Jzas repeatedly interfered on such grounds as these with

the findings of courts of first instance on pure questions of fact, and

even credibility."

This principle has consistently been followed in several other judgments

including Mahawithana vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1962) 64 N. L. R.

217 and De Silva & Others v Seneviratne & Another (1981) 2 Sri L.R. 7.

In the instant appeal, the learned High Court Judge who delivered the

judgment had no opportunity of observing the demeanour of the two lay

witnesses. She has considered their testimonial trustworthiness upon perusal of

the transcript and therefore her determination on credibility could not be

equated to a finding of fact made on the credibility of a witness based on

demeanour and deportment.

In view of the above reasoning, I am of the considered view, that this is an

instance where the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the

testimonial trustworthiness of witness lasing and the conflicting nature of the

circumstances under which the dying declaration was made.

The 2nd and 3rd grounds of appeal relates to the identity of the deceased

and the dead body on which the post mortem examination was conducted as per

the PMR marked Pl.

9

It is noted that the indictment referred to the deceased as Shantha alias

Nishantha alias Munubura. Both lasing and Ranjith referred to a statement by a

person called Munubura and none of these witnesses knew his actual name.

The PMR did not have any names of the persons who identified the dead

body before the medical officer before she commenced the post mortem

examination. The Prosecution has failed to fill this gap in their case by tracing the

witnesses who did identify the dead body of Munubura before the medical

officer, which they could easily have done upon perusal of the notes of

investigation.

A similar situation was considered in Namaratne & Another v The State

(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 274 and this Court has rejected the submissions of the accused -

appellant on the basis that the PMR of the deceased contained the full name of

the deceased. In this instance however, the name of the deceased as appearing

in the PMR is "Shantha/VVijetunga/Munupura". Only the names of Shantha and

Munupura are common in the PMR and the indictment and it is not explained as

to who provided the name Wijetunga to the medical officer. The submissions of

the learned Deputy Solicitor General that an inference could be drawn from the

established facts as to the identity of the dead body cannot be accepted as it was

incumbent upon the prosecution to establish this fact beyond a reasonable

doubt.

The 4th ground of appeal is in relation to the complaint of burden of proof

erroneously imposed on the accused-appellant. The basis for this ground of

appeal is the pronouncement made by the learned High Court Judge that it was

for the accused-appellant to prove that the deceased was not in a position to

10

make a statement as to who stabbed him. The accused-appellant sought to

challenge the claim of the prosecution that the deceased has made a dying

declaration on the medical witness's opinion that he could have made a

statement soon after the injury to his liver and added that the time period

during which he could have make a statement depend on the severity of

bleeding.

In her judgment, learned High Court Judge, citing Section 101 of the

Evidence Ordinance, held that it was for the accused-appellant to establish what

he asserted and he has failed to support his position as he did not place

evidence as to the rate of bleeding of the deceased and the deceased had no

ability to make a statement implicating the accused -appellant.

It is clear from the judgment of Ranasinghe v Attorney General (supra)

that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

that" ... the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged declaration was made".

In Ariyadasa v Queen 68 NLR 66, it was held that "where in a prosecution for

murder the accused gives evidence without seeking to bring himself within the benefit of

a general of special exception in the Penal Code, the burden of proof does not shift on to

him at any stage." In this instance the accused-appellant in his statement from the

dock merely stated a denial. Therefore, it is clear that he is relieved of any

evidentiary burden as he did not claim the benefit of any general or special

exception.

Therefore, the complaint that the accused-appellant was erroneously

imposed an evidentiary burden by the trial Court and thereby depriving him of

11

a fair trial is a sufficient ground to vitiate the conviction that had been entered

against him.

In his allocutus the accused-appellant merely pleaded for leniency in the

sentence in allowing him to re-join his family. It is clear from the wording of the

allocutus, that the accused- appellant made no admission of guilt.

Considering the several infirmities of the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge, it is my firm conclusion that the appeal of the accused-appellant be

allowed by setting aside the conviction entered against him and the sentence of

death imposed.

Appeal allowed.
