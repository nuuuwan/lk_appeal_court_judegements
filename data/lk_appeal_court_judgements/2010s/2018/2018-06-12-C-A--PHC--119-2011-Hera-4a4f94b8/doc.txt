Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant), in terms of section 3 of the Government Quarters (Recovery

of Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter filed an application under section 6 of the Act in

the Magistrate's Court of Embilipitiya seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the quarters described in the said application.

Learned Magistrate thereafter had pronounced the order dated 2011-06-30

evicting the Appellant from the said quarters.

The Appellant had thereafter filed a revision application in the Provincial ,

High Court of Southern Province holden in Embilipitiya seeking a revision of

the order of the learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court by its order dated 2011-08-01 had refused and

dismissed the said revision application.

It is that order that the Appellant is canvassing in this appeal before this

Court. This Court has perused the petition of appeal filed by the Appellant.

However, this Court cannot gather any plausible argument from the

5

contents of the petition of appeal of the Appellant which this Court ought

to consider in favour of the Appellant.

The Appellant does not advance any argument against the Provincial High

Court Judgment.

The Appellant has not controverted the fact that he is indeed residing in a

quarters of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka.

In the light of the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that it has

no basis to interfere with the order pronounced by the learned Provincial

High Court Judge.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

K K Wickremasinghe 1

I agree,

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
