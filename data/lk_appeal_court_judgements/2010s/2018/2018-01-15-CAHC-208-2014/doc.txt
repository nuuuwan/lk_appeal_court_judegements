challenging only the quantum of the sentence namely that 10 years rigorous

imprisonment imposed is excessive. Senior State Counsel Ms. Lakmali

Karunanayake who is appearing for the State maintaining the highest tradition

of the Attorney General's Department and submits that, the facts does not

warrant a conviction under Section 296 and its absolutely falls under Section

297. Further, considering the mitigatery circumstances submitted in the original

Court as well as in the Appellate Court, and the submissions of reduction of the

Sentence, we find that the conviction is lawful, therefore we affirm the

conviction. Regarding the Sentence we find it is little excessive. Therefore, we

impose 6 years rigorous imprisonment and other conditions namely, fine and the

compensation will stand as it is. Since the Accused Appellant is incarcerated six

years rigorous imprisonment will be implemented from the date of conviction.

We direct the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from 31.07.2014. If

the Accused- Appellant failed to pay the fine and the compensation the default

sentence will be implemented consecutively.

Appeal regarding the sentence is allowed .
