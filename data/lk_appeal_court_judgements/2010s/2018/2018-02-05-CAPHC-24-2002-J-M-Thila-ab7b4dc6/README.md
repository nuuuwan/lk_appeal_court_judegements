JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court

of the Central Province holden in Kandy praying for a writ of

Mandamus to compel the Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Respondent) to pay him Rs.

550,000/= as back wages and other allowances.

Perusal of the material shows that the Appellant remains

suspended from his service from the time of his interdiction on

1981-06-14. He has not appealed or taken any action to have

that status changed. Therefore the question arises whether

indeed the Respondent is obliged to pay him back wages as

claimed by the Appellant.

Perusal of the judgment dated 2001-11-07 pronounced by the

learned Provincial High Court Judge shows that he has refused

the application of the Appellant on the ground that there is no

legal duty on the part of the Respondent to pay back wages to

the Appellant.

The written submission filed in this Court on behalf of the

Appellant also asserts the position that the Respondent had not

so far acceded to his request for re-instatement in service.

Thus, this Court too takes the view that the Appellant has failed

to satisfy that the Respondent is under a legal duty to pay him

back wages in these circumstances.

Therefore the question of paying back wages simply would not

arise. Resultant position would be for this Court to conclude that

this appeal is an appeal which has been filed without any

justifiable reason.

5

On the other hand, this Court is satisfied after perusal of the

judgment of the learned Provincial High Court Judge that the

conclusions arrived at, and the reasons given thereto by him are

in order and thus requires no intervention by this Court.

In these circumstances, this Court affirms the judgment of the

learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 2001-11-07 and

proceed to dismiss this appeal with costs.
