This is an appeal against the order given by the High Court Judge

of Chilaw on 27.02.2018. The appellant is a surety in Case No. HC

49/2013. We find that the High Court Judge has convicted the appellant

for contempt of Court. But there is no charge sheet served on the appellant

and no charge read out to the appellant. In the middle of the trial he has

found that the sureties were in Court and stating that they have given false

affidavit saying that the 3rd accused does not have a passport and

convicted them for contempt of Court. We find that the appellant's

affidavit does not say anything about the accused not having a passport.

Therefore, the finding of the learned High Court Judge is wrong and he

has convicted this appellant without reading out the charge or serving a

1

charge sheet and there has been no representation for the appellant. This

is contrary to all principles of natural justice. Section 18 of the Judicature

Act No.2 of 1978 provides that any person who commits contempt should

be tried in a summary manner. Section 449 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 also deals with summary punishment for

perjury in open Court.

Both these sections state that a person charged for contempt of

Court should be tried summarily.

Learned State Counsel concedes the fact that the appellant has been

convicted without a charge sheet. For the above stated reasons, we set

aside the illegal order of the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw delivered

on 27.02.2018 and acquit the appellant.

The appellant acquitted. Appeal allowed.
