A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking a mandate

In the nature of writ of Certiorari, to quash the determination by the 3rd

Respondent to cancel the registration of the Vidyawardhana Pirivena, as contained

in latter dated 29/411998, marked P7 (a), and the determination by the 3rd

Respondent, upholding the said cancellation in appeal as contained in latter dated

31107/1998, marked Pll, and writ of Mandamus, to compel the 1st to 5th

Respondents to re-register the Pirivena No. 2IPIRIIKU/32, and to appoint the

Petitioner as the Principal of the said Pirivena with back wages from 2110711998

to date.

It is observed that, the Petitioner been aggrieved by the said decision dated

29/0411998, marked P7 (a), has filed CAlWriti l339/98, to quash the same order.

However, due to a criminal case pending against the Petitioner on the same issue,

the Petitioner sought permission of Court to withdraw the said case with the

liberty to file a fresh application.

The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents have raised a preliminary

objection to the Petition that, the Petitioner has failed to certify the copies of the

documents annexed to the Petition and therefore, has failed to comply with rule 3

(1) (a) of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990, and contends that it is a fatal

4

irregularity upon which the Court must necessarily dismiss this application. The

Respondents have pleaded to the said irregularity in their Petition.

Rule 3(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990,

states that;

"Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 and 141 of the

constitution shall be by way of Petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified

copies thereof) in the form of exhibits, and where a Petitioner is unable to

tender any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and

seek the leave of Court to furnish such document later; where the Petitioner

fails to comply with the rule the Court may, ex mero motu or at the instance

of any party, dismiss such application. JJ

In the instant case a large number of marked documents are annexed to the

Petition, which are photo copied documents, however, not duly certified as true

copies by an Attorney-at-Law. It is observed that the impugned documents marked

P7 (a) and Pll are annexed marked "True Copy" without identifying the person

who certified the said document's as true copies. The said irregularity has

deprived the Court of its reliance on documentary evidence, which is essential to

deal with the merits of this application.

5

The State Counsel submits that none of the marked documents served on

the Respondents are certified copies as required by the said Supreme Court Rule.

It is observed that several documents which are material to this application are not

duly certified and the failure to comply to the said requirement is a violation of the

provisions of the Supreme Court Rules. The Petitioner has also failed to seek the

leave of Court to submit such documents even at a later stage explaining the

reasons for such inability.

In Perera Vs. Perera 2001 3 SLR 30, the Court cited with approval C.A.

Application No. 18/91, decided on 2611111991, where Justice Grero on the

question of whether the imperative provisions of the Supreme Court Rules where

by a Petition shall be accompanied by originals of documents material to the

action and duly certified copies need to be filed as exhibits held;

" the view that where the documents are essential and when the court is

required to go into the merits of the application, non compliance of

requirements regarding the tendering of such documents without

satisfactory explanation for such non compliance is a violation of the

provisions of the Supreme Court Rules and was fatal to the application".

As submitted by the State Counsel, the Court has taken a similar view on

numerous occasions where the Petitioner has failed to comply with rule 3(1) (a) of

the Supreme Court Rules which has been considered as a fatal irregularity, where

the Court must necessarily dismiss the application.

6

In the case of Urban Development Authority Vs. Ceylon Entertainments

Limited and others 2004 (1) SLR 95 the court held that;

"the appellant failed to file in the Court of Appeal duly certified copies of

material documents as required by Rules 3(b) read with Rule 3(a) of the

Supreme Court Rules. It is settled law that Rule 3 of the Supreme Court

Rules must be adhered to. "

It is also noted that, in spite of the undertaking to file written submissions

by 02/03/2018, the Petitioner has failed to do so.

It is mandatory that the Petitioner complied with the requirements of Rule

3(1) (a), of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990, and the failure

to comply as observed, necessitates a dismissal of this application.

Accordingly, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
