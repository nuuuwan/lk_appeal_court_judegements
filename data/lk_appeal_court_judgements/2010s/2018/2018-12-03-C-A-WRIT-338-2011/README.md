By an amended petition dated 31st May 2011, the Petitioners have sought the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the proceedings in Case No. NS/577 in the

Magistrate's Court of Pugoda;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order of the 3rd Respondene refusing to

discharge the Petitioners in Case No. NS/577 in the Magistrate's Court of

Pugoda;

c) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 3rd Respondent from proceeding with

Case No. NS/577 in the Magistrate's Court of Pugoda;

1 The 3'd Respondent was the Magistrate of Pugoda who made the said Order.

3

d) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd Respondent to discharge the

Petitioners from the proceedings in Case No. NS/577 in the Magistrate's

Court of Pugoda;

e) An interim order suspending and/or staying further proceedings in Case

No. NS/577 in the Magistrate's Court of Pugoda until the final

determination of this application.

The application for interim relief h,Jd been supported on 3rd June 2011. This

Court, having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners and the Hon.

Attorney General had issued the aforementioned interim order. Taking into

consideration the circumstances of this case, this Court had issued a direction

to release the Petitioners from the proceedings of Case No. NS/577 in the

Magistrate's Court of Pugoda, with a further direction to the Petitioners to

appear in the Magistrate's Court when noticed.

The facts of this case very briefly are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner was a Sub-Inspector of Police and the 2nd Petitioner was a

Police Constable serving at the Kirindiwela Police Station at the time the

incident, which is the subject matter of this application, arose. According to

the Petitioners, while they were on mobile duty on 13th August 2010 at about

2055 hours, they had been informed by the Kirindiwela Police Station that a

person under the influence of alcohol was behaving violently and cqusing

nuisance to the public, close to the Papiliwela junction in the Kirindiwela area.

The Petitioners, together with Police Driver Dharmasiri had proceeded to the

4

said location, arrested the said person, Amerasinghe Arachige David

Amerasinghe and put him inside the rear of the Police Cab. The Petitioners

claim that while they were proceeding to the Kirinidiwela Police Station,

Amerasinghe had jumped out of the Police Cab. The Petitioners claim further

that Amerasinghe sustained injuries and was bleeding from his ear and that

with the assistance of the persons who were around, they had taken

Amerasinghe to the Radawana Government Hospital. In view of the serious

injuries sustained by Amerasinghe, he was transferred to the Gampaha

National Hospital and thereafter to the National Hospital, Colombo where he

succumbed to his injuries at about S.30am on 14th August 2010.

On the same day, i.e. 14th August 2010, the Officer-in-Charge of the Kirindiwela

Police Station had reported facts by way of a "B" Report filed in the

Magistrate's Court of Pugoda Case No. B/678/2010. The Unofficial Magistrate

had conducted his investigations the same day and after recording statements

of several witnesses, had ordered that a post mortem examination be

conducted. He had also directed that the Police Officers involved in the arrest

of Amerasinghe be present in Court on 16th August 2010.

The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer of Colombo at that time had conducted

the post mortem examination on lSth August 2010. The 'cause of death' form

submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer to the Magistrate's Court on 16th

August 2010 specified that there were head injuries due to blunt trauma and

that the injury pattern is suggestive of a back fall and hitting the right side of

the head.

5

At the Inquest conducted on 18th August 2010, several witnesses had given

evidence, with some of them giving versions different to what was in the '8'

report, especially with regard to the manner in which Amerasinghe received

his injuries.

In this factual background, when the case was called in the Magistrate's Court

of Pugoda on 18th August 2010, the learned Magistrate had made an order

remanding the Petitioners. The application for bail had been refused by the

learned Magistrate as the investigations were continuing. The subsequent

revision application filed by the Petitioners in the High Court of Gampaha

seeking bail had been rejected by the learned High Court Judge.

The Post Mortem Report had been submitted to the Magistrate's Court of

Pugoda on 9th September 2010. A copy thereof has been annexed to the

petition marked IPS'. This Court has examined IpS' and notes that there were

several external injuries on the body of Amerasinghe, which have been caused

by blunt trauma. Although the cause of death has been given as head injuries

due to blunt trauma, the Judicial Medical Officer had specifically stated that

there was no evidence of injuries of intentional violence.

The Petitioners claim that by an order dated 22nd December 2010, the learned

Magistrate had formed the opinion that the death of Amerasinghe was a

homicide and decided to conduct a Non-Summary Inquiry {NSI}, pending which

both Petitioners were kept in remand custody. The charge sheet had been filed

on ih February 2011 against the Petitioners for causing the death of

Amerasinghe, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The Petitioners state further that bail applications filed on their behalf in the

High Court of Gampaha in January 2011 had been refused by the learned High

Court Judge of Gampaha by his Order dated 25th February 2011, inspite of the

Hon. Attorney General informing Court that there is no objection to the

granting of bail.

While the above developments were taking place, by a letter dated 28th

December 2010, the Hon. Attorney General had called for the original case

record in the said case. Bya letter dated 28th February 2011, the Hon. Attorney

General had issued the following letter to the Senior Superintendent of Police,

with a copy to the learned Magistrate:

The contents of the said letter were conveyed to the learned Magistrate in

open Court on 3rd March 2011 by the Inspector of Police appearing for the

Prosecution. However, the learned Magistrate had wanted to clarify matters

with the Hon. Attorney General and the matter had been refixed for 31st

March 2011. This Court observes that in his affidavit submitted to this Court,

the learned Magistrate has taken up the position that the Hon. Attorney

7

General has not issued any direct instructions to the Magistrate with regard to

the conduct and/or conclusion and/or termination of the non-summary

proceedings and therefore the said letter cannot be construed as a directive

issued under the provisions of Section 398(2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No 15 of 1979, as amended.

On 31st March 2011, a Senior State Counsel representing the Hon. Attorney

General appeared before the learned Magistrate and made submissions on the

legal position with regard to the aforementioned advise tendered by the Hon.

Attorney General. By his order delivered on 28th April 2011, the learned

Magistrate had refused to discharge the Petitioners and proceeded with the

non-summary inquiry. This Court observes that on that date, the learned

Magistrate had recorded the evidence of several witnesses including that of

Kulatissa who had stated that he witnessed the 1st Petitioner assaulting the

deceased Amerasinghe.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate refusing to

discharge them from the Non summary proceedings, the Petitioners invoked

the Jurisdiction of this Court, seeking the aforementioned relief.

This matter was taken up for argument on 18th June 2018, at the conclusion of

which the learned Counsel for all parties agreed to tender written submissions

on the following:

1) Whether the Writ jurisdiction of this Court conferred under Article ~40 of

the Constitution would extend to review an order of the Magistrate's

Court;

8

2) Whether a Magistrate is bound to comply with a direction issued by the

Hon. Attorney General prior to the conclusion of a non-summary inquiry.

All parties had accordingly tendered written submissions. The learned

President's Counsel appearing for the 3rd and 4th Respondents, while

addressing the above two issues, had taken up the position that even though

on a plain reading of Article 140 of the Constitution, the power to issue orders

in the nature of Writs against any Court of first instance has been recognised,

this Court should not exercise the discretion vested in this Court in this

instance as the Petitioners had an alternative remedy by way of preferring an

appeal or a revision application, seeking to set aside the impugned order of the

learned Magistrate.

It has been held in several judgments delivered by this Court as well as by the

Supreme Court that a Writ will not lie if an alternative remedy which is equally

effective is available to the Petitioner. Thus, in the event of this Court

upholding the said argument, the necessity to consider the aforementioned

two questions would not arise. This aspect however, had not been addressed

during the oral submissions. Hence, when this matter was mentioned for

judgment on 20th September 2018, this Court requested the learned Counsel

for the Petitioners to tender his response with regard to the said submission.

Accordingly, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners has tendered several

judgments in order to demonstrate that a Writ would lie even though an

alternative remedy was available

9

What are the alternative remedies that the Respondents are speaking of? This

Court observes that any person dissatisfied with an order of a Magistrate can

always invoke the appellate2 or revisionary jurisdiction of this Court [or the

High Court of the Province], as provided for in Article 138(1) of the

Constitution, which reads as follows:

"The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of

the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction

of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the High Court,

in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of

First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such High

Court, Court of First Instance tribunal or other institution may have taken

cogn iza nce:"

The power of this Court to make any order as the interests of justice may

require, in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction, has been set out in Article

145 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:

"The Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or on any application made, call

for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of First Instance and in

the exercise of its revisionary powers may make any order thereon as the

interests of justice may require."

2 Provided such a right is available.

10

This Court also observes that in terms of Section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure, the "Court of Appeal may call for and examine the record of any

case, whether already tried or pending trial in the High Court or Magistrate's

Court, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any

sentence or order passed therein or as to the regularity of the proceedings of

such court."

The above provisions provide a person who is dissatisfied with an order of a

Magistrate to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, which has been

explained by the Supreme Court in Marian Bee Bee Vs. Seyed Mohamed and

others3 in the following manner:

liThe power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its

object is the due administration of justice and the correction of errors,

sometimes committed by this court itself, in order to avoid miscarriage of

justice."

The Petitioners however have not chosen the path of revision nor have they

explained as to why they have not done so. It is in this background that this

Court would like to consider the aforementioned preliminary issue.

The Respondents have referred this Court to several judgments in support of

their argument. Although none of these judgments relate to revision, the

principle laid down in these cases would be helpful in reaching a conclus.ion in

this regard.

In Halwan and Others v. Kaleelul Rahuman4, the petitioners had sought a Writ

of certiorari to quash an order made by the Wakf Board. An objection was

taken that in terms of the Muslim Mosque and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act,

No. 51 of 1956 (as amended), a right of appeal is available to this Court from

the said order and as the petitioners have in fact sought to exercise that right

of appeal, the application for the Writ of Certiorari could not be maintained.

Justice Sarath Silva (as he then was) upheld the above argument, having held

as follows:

itA party dissatisfied with a judgment or order, where a right of appeal is

given either directly or with leave obtained, has to invoke and pursue the

appellate jurisdiction. When such party seeks judicial review by way of

an application for a writ, as provided in Article 140 of the Constitution he

has to establish an excuse for his failure to invoke and pursue the

appellate jurisdiction. Such excuse should be pleaded in the petition

seeking judicial review and be supported by affidavit and necessary

documents. In any event, where such a party has failed to invoke

and pursue the appellate jurisdiction the extraordinary jurisdiction by

way of review will be exercised only in exceptional circumstances such

as, where the court, tribunal or other institution has acted without

jurisdiction or contrary to the principles of natural justice resulting in an

order that is void. The same principle is in my view applicable to instances

where the law provides for a right of appeal from a decision or order, of an

institution or an officer, to a statutory tribunal."

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has referred to the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Sirisena vs Kotawera-Udagama Co-operative Stores ltd5

where a Writ of Certiorari was sought to quash an award of an arbitrator to

whom a dispute had been illegally referred under the Co-operative Societies

Ordinance. In response to an objection taken that discretionary Writs such as

Certiorari should not issue where another and equally effectual remedy was

and is available to the Petitioner, Gratien J held as follows:

tilt is no doubt a well recognised principle of law that a Supreme Court will

not as a rule make an order of mandamus or certiorari where there is an

alternative and equally convenient remedy available to the aggrieved

party. But the rule is not a rigid one. In R. v. Wandsworth Justices-ex parte

Read6 an application was made for an order of certiorari quashing a

conviction made by the justices in excess of their jurisdiction. Objection

was taken, inter alia, that as the accused had a right of appeal to quarter

sessions, certiorari did not lie. Caldecote L.J., in over-ruling the objection,

said lias to the right of appeal to quarter sessions, it may be that the

applicant could have had his remedy if he had pursued that course, but I

am not aware of any reason why, in such circumstances as these, if the

applicant prefers to ask for an order of certiorari to quash the conviction

obtained in the manner I have described, the Court should be debarred

from making an order. In this case it has been admitted by the justices

that a mistake was made. This Court is in a position to remedy that

mistake by making an order of certiorari to quash the conviction, anp that

is the proper order which I think this Court should make II. Humphreys J.

in a separate judgment expressed the view that "if a person can satisfy

this Court that he has been convicted of a criminal offence as the result of

a complete disregard by the tribunal of the laws of natural justicel he is

entitled to the protection of this Court" even though an alternative

remedy was also available. I think that these observations are appropriate

to the present proceedings."

This Court observes that the above judgments arose from decisions of

administrative bodies whereas the decision that is sought to be quashed in this

application is an order made by a court of first instance.

Recourse to judicial review where an appeal to a higher court is available has

been discussed in Judicial Remedies in Public Law7 in the following manner:

"Judicial review is, in principle, available in relation to the acts and

omissions of inferior courts such as the county court or magistrates'

courts. In practice, the availability of judicial review is likely to be limited

by the availability of other methods of challenge such as appeals. Judicial

review will not normally be permitted if there are adequate alternative

remedies available. There are rights of appeal against decisions of district

judges and county courts, for example. Where the possibility of an appeal

to a higher court exists, that route is the appropriate method of

challenging the original decision rather than a claim for judicial review

unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying bring a claim for

judicial review."

7 By Sir Clive Lewis [5th Edition) page 75.

14

"A court may, in its discretion, refuse to grant permission to apply for

judicial review or refuse a remedy at a substantive hearing if an adequate

alternative remedy exists, or if such a remedy existed but the claimant

had failed to use it. The courts have evolved a general principle that an

individual should normally use alternative remedies where these are

available rather than judicial review. The courts take the view that:

" ... save in the most exceptional circumstances, judicial review jurisdiction

will not be exercised where other remedies are available and have not

been used."B

The question that arises for consideration in this application is what should a

Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument that

an alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative

remedy should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle

cannot be laid down and that the appropriate decision would depend on the

facts and circumstances of each case. That said, where the statute provides a

specific alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with a decision of a statutory

body should pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a discretionary

remedy of this Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be

able to prevent an injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore,

if the Writ jurisdiction is invoked where an equally effective remedy is

available, an explanation should be offered as to why that equally effective

remedy has not been resorted to.

8 Ibid; page 430.

15

This matter has been considered recently by this Court in J.H.S Jayamaha vs

Provincial Public Service Commission (North Western Province) and others9,

where Justice Janak De Silva, after a careful consideration of the relevant

authorities, held as follows:

"However, as it is a general principle, Courts have recognized several

qualifications in its application. There may be situations where the

alternative remedy is not adequate and efficacious in which event judicial

review is avaiiablelO It maybe that judicial review is capable of providing

immediate means of resolving the dispute in which case it may be the

more appropriate procedure. There may also be a need to obtain interim

relief which may not be possible under the alternative procedure. This is

not an exhaustive list and there are certainly other instances where

judicial review may be granted even though an alternative administrative

procedure exists."

This Court is in agreement with the above view and is also in agreement with

the following statement of Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R. in Reg. v. Panel

on Take-overs and Mergers Ex Parte Guinness Plcll, which has been referred

to in Jayamaha's case:

"I approach this appeal by reminding myself that the judicial review

jurisdiction of the High Court, and of this court on appeal, is a supervisory

or "long stop" jurisdiction ... I also remind myself that, consistently with

this "long stop" character, it is not the practice of the court to ent.ertain

16

an application for judicial review unless and until all avenues of appeal

have been exhausted, at least in so far as the alleged cause of complaint

could thereby be remedied. The rationale for this self-imposed fetter

upon the exercise of the court's jurisdiction is twofold. First, the point

usually arises in the context of statutory schemes and if Parliament

directly or indirectly has provided for an appeals procedure, it is not for

the court to usurp the functions of the appellate body. Second, the public

interest normally dictates that if the judicial review jurisdiction is to be

exercised, it should be exercised very speedily and, given the constraints

imposed by limited judicial resources, this necessarily involves limiting the

number of cases in which leave to apply should be given."

That brings this Court to the facts of this application once again. The

Petitioners complaint is that the learned Magistrate failed to comply with the

decision of the Hon. Attorney General and discharge them from the non-

summary proceedings. As the Petitioners were dissatisfied with the said

decision, the Petitioners could have invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the

High Court of the Province, which is a statutory remedy provided by the

Constitution. This Court is of the view that the revisionary jurisdiction is an

equally effective remedy that the Petitioners could have resorted to, where

the legality or propriety of the order of the learned Magistrate could have

been considered. No explanation has been offered by the Petitioners as to why

they did not invoke the revisionary jurisdiction, although this Court observes

that the Petitioners did in fact file revision applications when the learned

Magistrate refused to grant bail. Perhaps, the refusal of bail by the Prov.incial

High Court may have prompted the Petitioners to file this application and seek

the interim relief, which would then have the same effect as being released on

17

bail.' In these circumstances and given the peculiar facts of this case, this Court

is in agreement with the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the

3rd and 4th Respondents.

There are two other matters that this Court would like to advert to, in this

regard. The first is that the Petitioners could have proceeded with the non-

summary inquiry and permitted the learned Magistrate to make a suitable

decision based on the evidence at the end of the inquiry. The learned

Magistrate would then have been in a better position to decide whether the

material is sufficient for him to act in terms of Section 154(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure12 and commit the Petitioners to stand trial in the High

Court or else discharge them, for lack of evidence13. Thus, to some extent, this

application is premature. The second matter is that the Hon. Attorney General

can act in terms of Section 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code14 and quash the

committal, if the Hon. Attorney General is of the view that the evidence is

insufficient to indict the Petitioners in the High Court.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, this Court upholds the

aforementioned preliminary objection raised by the learned President's

12 Section 154{1} of the Code reads as follows: "If the Magistrate considers the evidence sufficient to put the accused on his trial, the Magistrate shall commit him for trial before the High Court."

13 Section 153{1} of the Code reads as follows: " If the Magistrate considers that the evidence against the accused is not sufficient to put him on his trial, the Magistrate shall forthwith for reasons to be recorded by him order him to be discharged as to the particular charge under inquiry;"

14 Section 396 reads as follows: "If, after the receipt by him of the certified copy of the record of an inquiry forwarded under Section 159, the Attorney-General is of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant a commitment for trial, or if for any reason he is of the opinion that the accused should be discharged from the matter of the complaint, information or charge, and if the accused is in custody from. further detention, he may by order in writing quash the commitment made by the Magistrate and may direct the Registrar of the High Court to return the record of the inquiry to the Magistrate's Court. The Attorney General shall in every such case issue to the Magistrate such directions as to the disposal of the complaint, information or charge against the accused as to him may seem expedient, and it shall be the duty of the Magistrate to comply with the directions so issued."

10

Counsel for the 3rd and 4th Respondents and therefore, is of the view that this

is not a fit case where this Court should exercise the jurisdiction conferred on

this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution.

In these circumstances, the necessity for this Court to consider this matter on

the merits does not arise. Accordingly, this application is dismissed, without

costs.
