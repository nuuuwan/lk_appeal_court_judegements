ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal filed by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") seeking to set aside an order of

dismissal of her revision application No. HC/02/2014/Revision, made by

the Provincial High Court of Uva Province holden in Badulla, upon holding

the view that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the said reVISIOn

application as per the judgment of the Supreme Court in The

Superintendent, Stafford Estate, Ragala and Others v SolaimuthuRasu

(2013) 1 Sri L.R. 25.

In his application No. 33752, filed under section 5 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended, the Applicant-

sought an order of ejectment of the Appellant from the State land

described in its schedule.

After an inquiry, the Magistrate's Court of BadulIa, by its order

dated 10.01.2012, had issued an order of ejectment against the-Appellant.

The Appellant had thereafter invoked revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court to have the said order of ejectment set aside. The

Provincial High Court dismissed her application on 11.02.2014 in limine for

want of jurisdiction.

Being aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, the Appellant seeks

to challenge its validity on the basis that the Provincial High Court had

erroneously held that it had no jurisdiction to entertain her revision

application.

The Provincial High Court, in its impugned order, has held that in

VIew of the reasoning of the Supreme Court judgment 0' The

Superintendent, Stafford Estate, Ragala and Others v Solaimuthu Rasu, it

has no jurisdiction to entertain the revision application filed by the

Appellant as its subject matter concerns a State land.

This determination by the Provincial High Court is challenged by

the Appellant and she submits to this Court that 1/ what the Supreme

Court has decided in that case was that the Provincial High Courts have no

jurisdiction to issue a writ in respect of State lands because State land is not a

devolved subject. The Supreme Court has not decided, and could not have decided,

and had no basis to decide, that the Provincial High Courts have 'no jurisdiction to

exercise revisionary jurisdiction where the land in question is a State land."

In his reply, the Respondent submits that the said Supreme Court

judgment " ... should not be interpreted beyond the appointed boundaries.

Because Article 154P(3)(6) grants parallel jurisdiction to revise any "order", and

it does not matter whether such order "relates or involves" State land or crime.

Legislative and Constitutional power relating to criminal law were not devolved

as much as power over State land; but once the Magistrates Courts exercise such

jurisdiction, then Provincial High Courts are rendered competent to exercise

revisionary jurisdiction only as a matter of revision of that Court" (emphasis is

original).

In view of the submissions of the Appellant this Court must

consider the question whether the Provincial High Court could exercise

revisionary jurisdiction over an order of ejectment issued by the

Magistrate's Court, upon an application under section 5 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

Article 154P(3)(b) confers jurisdiction to a Provincial High Court to;

"notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrate's Courts and Primary Courts within the Province";

In addition, Article 154P(3)(c) also provide jurisdiction to;

"exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may,

by law, provide."

Section 5 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 made the provisions of the written law applicable mutatis

4

mutandis to applications made to the Court of Appeal for revision of any

conviction, sentence or order by a Magistrate's Court.

It is clear upon plain reading of the Article 154P(3)(b) and (c) that it

does not impose any restriction to the scope of the revisionary Jurisdiction

it had conferred upon the Provincial High Court over the Magistrates and

Primary Courts which are located within the province. Section 5 of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act also does not contain

any such restriction in its scope. Thus, it seems that the Provincial High

Court could exercise revisionary jurisdiction over any order issued by the

Magistrate's Court unless such exercise is specifically prevented by law.

We now proceed to consider the reasoning of the Supreme Court, in

the light of above considerations.

The question of law that had been presented before their Lordships was;

"Did the Court of Appeal err by deciding that the Provincial High

Court has jurisdiction to hear cases where dispossession or

encroachment or alienation of State lands is/ are in issue?"

Having considered the relevant Articles of the Constitutions and

judicial precedents, the apex Court has decided that;

/I the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the

Provincial High Court of Kandy had jurisdiction to issue a writ of

certiorari in respect of a quit notice issued under State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act as amended."

Article 154P(4)(b) confers the Provincial High Courts with

jurisdiction to issue:-

5

"orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any person

exercising, within the Province, any power under

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that Province, in respect of any

matter set out in the Provincial Council List./I

Their Lordships thereafter proceeded to answer the question of law

presented before them as follows;

"The question of law considered by this Court is thus answered in

the affirmative./I

It is clear that the ratio of the said judgment of the Supreme Court is

that the Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an

application under Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution in relation to State

lands. There is no reference to Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution in the

said judgment, which had conferred revisionary jurisdiction to Provincial

High Courts established under Article 154P of the Constitution. Although

the question of law presented before the apex Court had been formulated

in wider terms, their Lordships have answered it only in relation to

provisions contained in Article 154P(4) (b). We are therefore inclined to

accept the submissions of the Appellant on this point.

Therefore, the reference contained in the said judgment to the effect

that /I it is unfortunate that the Court of Appeal fell into cardinal error of holding

6

that the Provincial High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications

for discretionary remedies in respect of quit notices under the provisions of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended" should be

understood in the context of Article 154P(4)(b) only.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we are of the considered view that

the Provincial High Court had fallen in to error in holding that it had no

jurisdiction to entertain an application for revision under Article 154P(3)(b)

of the Constitution, upon misapplication of the principle of law enunciated

in the judgment of The Superintendent, Stafford Estate, Ragala and Others

v Solaimuthu Rasu. This Court has already held the identical view on this

point in CA(PHC) No.149/2014 - decided on 17.06.2015.

Accordingly, we allow the appeal of the Appellant and further direct

the relevant Provincial High Court to proceed with the inquiry into the

revision application and to make an order on its merits.

Considering the circumstances under which this appeal is made, we

make no order for costs.
