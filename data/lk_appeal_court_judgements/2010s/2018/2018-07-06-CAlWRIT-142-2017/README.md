A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking, a mandate

in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash the findings and sentence of the Order

of the Court Marshal, as contained in document marked P5.

When this application was taken up for support, Senior State Counsel

appearing for the Respondents brought to the notice of Court that by Gazette

Notification No. 2015 - 2017, dated 12/0412017, filed of record, the said sentence

passed by the Court Marshal has been approved by the President of the Republic.

The Counsel for the Petitioner concedes to the said fact and also concedes that the

said Gazette Notification has been published.

I observe the following paragraphs of the affidavit tendered to Court by the

Petitioner;

Paragraph 56,

I state that, I verily believe that the conviction and sentence has not been

approved by His Excellency the President and that in any event the appeal on

sentence made by me has not been submitted to either the Commander of the

Army or His Excellency the President.

Paragraph 57,

4

I state that in-eparable damage would be caused to me if the sentence is now

sent for approval of His Excellency the President or Gazetted, -----

It is further observed that, the interim relief prayed for in paragraph (b) to

the Petition is also pleaded in order to prevent "the Respondents from taking steps

to get the approval of His Excellency the President or publish by Gazette

Notification the sentence of the Court Marshall and/ or submitting for approval the

dismissal of the Petitioner from service ----."

I further observe that, the Affidavit tendered by the Petitioner, dated i h

April 2017, has been signed prior to the date of publication of the Gazette

Notification. Therefore, it is clear that the facts and circumstances pleaded by the

Petitioner challenging the Court Marshall findings relates to events prior to the

approval of the sentence by the President of the Republic by Gazette Notification

dated 12/0412017. The said Gazette Notification does not form part of the

Petitioners pleadings nor has the Petitioner sought permission of Court to submit

the said Gazette Notification to Court.

It is noted that the Petitioners application for relief should be within the

scope of the Petition. The sentence imposed by the Court Marshall has been

approved by the subsequent'oazette Notification which was clearly not within the

knowledge of the Petitioner at the time of filling this application. The Petitioners

application for relief is based on the premise that, if the sentence is submitted for

approval by His Excellency the President and/ or Gazetted, the Petitioner would

' 5

suffer irreparable damage. Therefore as of now, there is a clear change in facts and

circumstances, which the pleadings do not support. Accordingly, it is the view of

this Court that the Petitioner should not be permitted to enlarge the scope of his

application to encompass the change in facts and circumstances, as noted earlier,

which were not contemplated at the time of submitting the affidavit, in support of

the Petition. Therefore, this Court should, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse

the Petitioner's application.

I note with regret, that in spite of the undertaking given to Court to file

written submissions by 04/05/2018, the Respondents have failed to do so on the

agreed date or thereafter.

In all the above circumstance, notice is refused and the Petition is dismissed

without costs.

P. Padman Surasena, J. (PICA)

I agree.
