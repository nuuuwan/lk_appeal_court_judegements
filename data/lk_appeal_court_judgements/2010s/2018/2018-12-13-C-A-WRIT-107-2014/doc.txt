RESPONDENTS

M. M. A GAFFOOR, J.

The Petitioner is an incorporated company under the companies Act No.

07 of 2007 and the 1st Respondent was an employee appointed as a Field

Sales Manager by a letter of appointment dated 22nd February 2013

(marked as P3) with the effect of 18th February 2013.

The 1st Respondents services were terminated by the Petitioner through

the letter of termination dated 16th August 2013 (marked as P4) effective

from 19th August 2013 under the ground that the 1st Respondent had

failed to serve the Petitioner Company to its satisfaction and failed to

achieve the expected competency which was required for the 1st

Respondents confirmation. Thereafter the 1st Respondent had made a

complaint against the Petitioner Company to the Commissioner General of

Labour, the 2nd Respondent under the Termination of Employment of the

Workmen (Special Provisions Act). The inquiry was conducted by the 4th

Respondent and under 3rd Respondents division.

The Petitioner Company has raised a Preliminary objection that the 1st

Respondent did not have the continuous service period of 12 months and

further stated that the Respondents had no power or authority to entertain

the application in terms of Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of

Employment of the Workmen (Special Provisions Act) No. 45 of 1971 on

the basis that the 1st Respondent was appointed subject to a probation

period of six months and he failed to achieve the expected competency for

the confirmation.

The Petitioner Company further submitted that the 1st Respondent was a

probationary employee in the Petitioner Company and according to

Termination of Employment of the Workmen (Special Provisions Act) No.

45 of 1971, a Probationer cannot entitled to seek reliefs.

4

At the inquiry both parties tented their written submissions and order

delivered on 13th March 2014, it dismissed the preliminary objection raised

by the Petitioner Company and proceeded to hear the substantial matter.

The facts that germane to the issue is the applicability of Section 3(1) (b) of

the Termination of Employment of the Workmen (Special Provisions Act)

No. 45 of 1971 as amended by the Act No. 51 of 1988 in relation to the 1st

Respondents termination by the Petitioner Company and whether he

comes under the protection of the Act.

Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of the Workmen

(Special Provisions Act) No. 45 of 1971 reads as follows:

the provision of this Act, other than this section, shall not apply,

(a) .....

(b) to the termination of employment of any workman who has been employed by an employer for a period of less than one year.

(i)..

(ii).

(iii).

(iv)

(v)

(vi).

In the continuous period of 12 months, commencing from the date of employment, if such termination takes place within that period of 12 months or;..

Section 3 of the amendment No. 51 of 1988 the following words were

replaced Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of the

Workmen (Special Provisions Act) No. 45 of 1971,

a period of less than one hundred and eighty days

It is clear that a workman had to work for a minimum period of 12

months according to Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of

the Workmen (Special Provisions Act) No. 45 of 1971 and after the

amended by Section 3 of the amendment No- 51 of 1988 the minimum

period had been changed to 180 days.

Further, it is observed that according to the provisions that the Termination

of Employment of the Workmen (Special Provisions Act), it is not

applicable to a workman who has been employed for a period less than

180 days and when it comes to the 1st Respondent, he served with the

Petitioner Company from 18th February 2013 to 19th August 2013 (182

days).

The Petitioner Company submitted that although the 1st Respondent had

been employed for 182 days but did not satisfy the minimum employment

service of 12 months and further stated that the 1st Respondent period of

employment did not fall under continuous period of 12 months,

commencing from the date of employment.

The Respondents submitted that, according to the Act the 180 days

constitutes the minimum period of employment, and if the purpose of the

section was to insist on a person working for a full 12 months, then the

requirement for working 180 days would become meaningless. Therefore

the period of 12 months is required to be continuous.

Further, they stated that the above requirement does not imply that a

workman must be employed for 12 continuous months, but simply ensures

6

that service periods in other years of employment are not taken into

account in order to satisfy the minimum requirement of 180 days of

employment.

And the Respondents quoted that the word period of 12 months

commencing from the date of employment if such termination takes place

within that period of 12 months are the time limits within which the above

mentioned minimum period of employment must be determined.

In CA Writ No 305/10 (CA Minutes dated 23.07.2012) the identical issue

observed and the Section 3(1) (b) had clarified by Justice S.

Sriskandarajah as follows:

The section does not contemplate that the employee should

have worked for a continuous period of 12 months for the

application of this law. The continuous period of 12 months is

taken into consideration when giving credit to the period of

absence in order to calculate the period he was employed

with the employer, if an employee was in service for not less

than 180 days within that twelve months, then he is entitled to

seek the remedy under the said law. In these circumstances

the Commissioner has quite rightly over-ruled the preliminary

objection raised by the Petitioner and held the Employee is

entitled to seek remedy under the said law.

According to the clarification given by Justice S. Sriskandarajah, I

observed that the words period of 12 months commencing from the date

of employment if such termination takes place within that period of 12

months are the outer limits to calculate the period of employment which is

required under the Act.

7

I am of the firm view that the 1st Respondent had served 182 days of

minimum period of employment and qualified and eligible to apply for relief

under section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of the Workmen

(Special Provisions Act).

I hold that the 4th Respondents findings and the dismissal of the

preliminary objection raised by the Petitioner Company was in accordance

with the Section 3(1) (b) of the Termination of Employment of the

Workmen (Special Provisions Act).

In the aforementioned reasons, I dismiss the Petitioner Companys

application without Cost.

Application dismissed
