A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

he Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action in the District Court of Gampaha praying for a partition of a

land known as Godaparagahalanda and Kumbura morefully described in the schedule to

the plaint. Admittedly the land to be partitioned is in extent of 4 acres and 34.836

perches (A: 4 R: 0 P: 34.836). The tt, 3rd and 8th Defendants filed a joint statement of

claim and moved that the land be partitioned in conformity with the schedule of shares

as given in their statement of claim.

The other Defendants to the action also filed their statements of claim. When the case

was taken up for further trial on 29th March 1996, the parties reached an agreement as to

the identity of the corpus and proceeded to reach a settlement or compromise as is

reflected at pages 169, 170 and 171 of the Appeal Brief. After the parties reached the

agreement to consensually allot the shares, they also reached a further compromise that

the balance shares of 254 perches could be allotted according to the evidence to be given.

The brief evidence that was led was that of the Plaintiff's husband namely one

Jayawardena Pathiranage Jinadasa. Before I proceed to the evidence given and the

judgment delivered thereafter on 16th October 1997, the initial settlement that was

reached goes as follows~vide page 170 of the brief.

2nd Defendant

8th Defendant

9th Defendant

10th Defendant

lIth Defendant

235 perches

104 perches

24 perches

24 perches

40 perches

Thus a total extent of 419 perches were thus allotted among the parties in terms of the

above settlement. It has to be remembered that on the day that the settlement was

entered into namely on 29th March 1996, the 3rd Defendant who is the Appellant before

this Court was represented by the same Counsel who appeared for the 1st and 8th

Defendants. In other words he was privy to the consensual agreement.

s

After the testimony of Plaintiff's husband concluded, the learned Additional District

Judge of Gampaha also made order that the schedule of shares to be allotted to parties be

produced on 02nd May 1996~vide page 174 of the Appeal Brief. It is significant to observe

here that the Appellant before this Court namely the 3rd Defendant along with the tt and

8th Defendants submitted a share list wherein the 3rd Defendant had agreed to be allotted

1 rood and 15.966 perches in extent~vide page 54 of the Appeal Brief. It is this extent of

land that the learned Additional District judge of Gampaha finally allotted to the 3rd

Defendant~ Appellant in his judgment dated 16th December 1997.

The Plaintiff was also allotted a share in one rood and 39.948 perches as were the other

parties to the action. It would appear that none of the other parties including the

Plaintiff have chosen to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the judgment

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha based on the consensual

share list put in by the tt, 3rd and 8th Defendants. Having submitted the share list before

the learned Additional District Judge as reflected at page 54 of the Appeal Brief and after

the Court delivered its judgment based on the share list, the 3rd Defendant~Appellant

now contends before this Court that he should obtain more than what was submitted by

way of his share allotment before the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha. The

share list though was ordered to be submitted after evidence had been led. But it is the

contention of the 3rd Defendant~ Appellant that he should secure more shares over and

above what had been specified in the share list.

If the only evidence that had been led at the trial revealed that the Appellant stood to

gain more, that could have been incorporated in the share list but the Appellant declared

that he was entitled only to 1 rood and 15.966 perches.

If one peruses the judgment of the District Court of Gampaha it would appear that the

share allotment made by the learned Additional District Judge is definitely based on the

consensual document as reflected at page 54 of the Appeal Brief.

In my view the learned Additional District Judge cannot be faulted for founding his

judgment on the consent of parties. It would appear that the oral evidence led at the trial

6

..

does not give the 3rd Defendant~ Appellant any share over and above the allotment

declared by him in the consensual list (vide p.54 of the Appeal Brief). In the course of the

argument this Court invited the parties to submit before this Court how much extra

share is brought out by evidence oral or otherwise because the agreement had been that

the balance shares would be decided upon according to evidence led. But such a

determination of share entitlement based on oral evidence and any other testimony has

not been tendered to this Court.

The attention of this Court has been drawn to the case of w.G. Roslin v. H.B.

Marihamy 1994 3 Sri LR 262 wherein S.N. Silva J. (as His Lordships then was) with

Gunasekera,J. agreeing held as follows:~

"When an agreement is entered into, the court has to be satisfied only as to whether the agreement

is between all the parties having interest in the land sought to be partitioned. In the event of such

agreement, the respective shares or interests to given to each party is based upon the compromise

that is reached and not on an examination of title"

In the circumstances, this Court finds no error as to the allotment of shares as regards

the 3rd Defendant~Appellant. It is his voluntary submission of entitlement as to shares

that has been approved by the learned Additional District Judge. Therefore, I proceed to

affirm the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha dated 16th

October 1997. Accordingly the appeal of the 3rd Defendant~ Appellant is dismissed.
