ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal filed by the Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the II Appellant") against the order of dismissal

of her revision application HCRA 214/08 by the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province holden in Colombo on 20.10.2011.

In her application to the Magistrate's Court of Colombo, the

Appellant sought an order of Court enabling her to act under Section

28A(3) of the Urban Development Act No 41 of 1978 as amended

(hereinafter referred to as the II Act") against an illegal construction by the

2

."

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Resporident").

The sketch the Appellant relied on, in support of her application,

shows that the Respondent, having built a house in the premises bearing

assessment No. 185/39A, Alakeshwara Road, Ethul Kotte, had constructed

10 windows along its western boundary wall.

It is evident that the Appellant made her application to the

Magistrate's Court on 22.10.2007 for an order under Section 28A(3) of the

said Act. After an inquiry, the Magistrate's Court made a short order on

17.10.2008 by which it has held that the Respondent had engaged in the

disputed "development activity" upon a valid permit issued to him under

reference No. W2/CN/43/2000, a fact admitted by the Appellant and

therefore it refuses her application.

Thereafter, the Appellant sought to revise the said order of the

Magistrate's Court on the basis that it had erroneously held that the

Respondent had a valid permit, purely on the development plan and

without considering the other documents that are relied upon by the

Appellant in support of her claim. After inquiry, the Provincial High Court

refused the Appellant's application on the basis that she failed to establish

exceptional circumstances.

In support of her appeat the Appellant contended that both the

lower Courts had failed to consider the fact that the Respondent had no

valid permit to carry out the development activity that had been clearly

identified and described in her application and in addition, the Courts

3

'.

have also failed to note that the development permit initially issued to the

Respondent had subsequently been revoked.

The Respondent, in his submissions resisting the appeal submitted

-that the amended plan submitted to the Appellant under reference

BA/N/188/2016 had been approved but he was not issued with a

Certificate of Conformity by the Appellant upon intervention of a local

politician and therefore the Provincial High Court was correct in refusing

the revision application of the Appellant. He further claims that the UDA

by its letter dated 11.10.2017 informed the Appellant that it had no

objections to the approval of the said amended plan" as those changes are

internal and does not affect the height and the foundation."

When the material placed before Magistrate's Court by the

contesting parties, it is apparent that there had been an ongoing dispute as

to the compliance to the conditions stipulated in the development issued to

the Respondent.

In view of this observation, it is appropriate to refer to the

chronology of events which finally led to the application under Section

28A(3) of the Act.

The development permit was issued to the Respondent on

27.08.1998 by the Appellant. On 15.10.2001, Director (Enforcement) of

UDA informs the Appellant that the Respondent had failed to comply with

the conditions of the development permit by illegally constructing certain

sections of the house and he would initiate legal action if the'Respondent

failed to tender amended plans for approval.

4

..

Thus, it is clear that even in 2001 the Respondent was in violation of

the development permit and was given opportunity to rectify the illegality

by submitting amended plans. The Appellant also had informed of this

" position to the Respondent on 21.11.2001. It is also evident that the

Respondent had failed to comply with the directive and by letter dated

28.10.2004, UDA directed the Appellant to initiate legal action against the

Respondent for violation of the terms of development permit.

Sub committed report of the Western Provincial Council confirms

that the windows along the boundary wall of the Respondent's house.

On 10.09.2007 th~ Respondent informs the Appellant that he would

submit an amended plan in respect of the windows he had constructed

along the western boundary wall and it was tendered eventually only on

18.09.2007.

An inspection was carried out by an officer from the Appellant's

Council on 26.10.2007 and it was reported that the amended plan could not

be recommended since certain segments of the construction was not

provided for sunlight and air. There were windows on the western

boundary wall.

The Appellant's application under Section 28A(3) to the Magistrate's

Court is dated 22.10.2007.

With the letter dated 14.11.2007, the Appellant informed the

Respondent that upon his failure to submit an amended plan fulfilling the

requirements, his application is refused.

I

When the Magistrate's Court pronounced its order on 17.10.2008,

that there was an approved building plan and as such it refuses the

Appellant's application under Section 28A(3) of the Act, these documents

had already been tendered to that Court by the parties. Nonetheless, it

made the impugned order.

Thus, it is clear that the Magistrate's Court order dated 17.10.2007

was made without proper appreciation of the attendant circumstances

which clearly established that the Respondent's II development activity"

had no legal sanction.

The claim by the Respondent that the Western boundary shown -in

the sketch is not the exact boundary as he is in the process of obtaining

additional strip of land to make up for the extent of land he lost due to

acquisition for archaeological site cannot be considered by the Court as it

had to decide the matter as it stood at the time of the application.

Similarly, the Provincial High Court, although referred to these

circumstances, has erroneously held that the Appellant has failed to

establish exceptional circumstances, when in fact the order of the

Magistrate's Court obviously made without a valid basis.

6

In the circumstances, we allow the appeal of the Appellant by

setting aside the orders of the Provincial High Court as well as the

Magistrate's Court as prayed for. The Appellant is entitled to the reliefs

prayed for in her application to the Magistrate's Court.

Parties will bear their costs.
