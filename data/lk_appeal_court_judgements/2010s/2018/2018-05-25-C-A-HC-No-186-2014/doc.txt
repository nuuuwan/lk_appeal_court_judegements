ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The accused -appellant was indicted for committing the murder of

Nnl1dikn Pus/lpnlal and attempted murder of Dehiwnln Ralalnge Abcywickrel11n

8mzdnm on or about 25 th January 1999 at Kil1lbuln Weln in the jurisdiction of

the High Court holden at Avissawella.

Upon his election, he was tried without a jury and was convicted on

both these counts. Consequent to the pronouncement of the judgment of

the High Court, the accused-appellant was sentenced to death in relation

to the charge of murder. However, it did not impose any sentence on the

accused-appellant on the 2nd count of attempted murder on account of

already imposed death sentence on the charge of murder.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions and sentence, the accused-

appellant sought intervention of this Court to set aside his convictions and

sentence of death.

At the hearing of the appeat learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant, confined his submissions only to the conviction and sentence on

the charge of murder. In support of the appeat learned Counsel for the

accused-appellant submitted that the High Court has erroneously found

his client guilty of murder since it failed to properly evaluate the reliability

of the only eye witness's evidence, in the light of several contradictions

marked during his evidence.

2

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant invited this Court to

consider the contradictions marked VI to V4 and submitted that in view of

these contradictions, the sole eye witness's evidence ought to be treated as

unreliable and should not have been acted upon by the trial Court.

In view of the submissions of the accused-appellant, it is necessary

to consider the sequence of events as narrated by the sole eye-witness to

the incident, who himself is an injured, in order to fully appreciate the

significance of the contrad ichons marked VI to V 4.

Witness Bn/ldnm, in his evidence before the High Court stated that,

at the time of the incident he was employed as a driver of a private bus

which serviced the bus route of Maharagama - Jayawardenepura Hospital.

The deceased was the conductor of this bus. The wih1ess knew the accused

well and addressed him as Podi Mnl1l7tulZ. On the day of the incident, the

accused-appellant got in to their bus when they were returning home in

the night. He wanted the bus to be stopped by the side of a paddy field for

him to pick a "spiral". Time was about 9.15 in the night.

Upon a request by the accused-appellant, the deceClsed too had

accompanied him to bring this item to the bus. After a few minutes, the

accused-appellant returned to the parked bus alone and wanted the

witness also to come with him. When enquired about the deceased, the

accused -appellant strangely replied that "he died and was drunk".

3

The witness complied with the request and when they walked about

100/150 meters through the paddy field from the place where the bus was

parked, the witness heard a moan. When asked from the accused-

appellant as to who it was, he replied that he had no idea. At the same

time, the person who moaned has called out the witness's name. The

witness then identified the voice of the deceased. When the wih1ess was

trying to locate the place where the deceased was, the accused-appellant

came from behind and cut his neck.

Being frightened with this experience, the witness then ran to his

sister's house which was located about 300 meters away from the place his

neck was cut. The accused- appellant has chased after him up to a point

and then gave up. Once the witness reached the house, he narrated the

incident to his aunt and made a request to locate the deceased, who was in

a critical condition. The witness was then rushed to hospital and was

treated for his injuries.

The contradictions could be considered at this stage against the

evidence reproduced above.

Contradiction marked as VI is in relation to the witness's assertion

in the High Court that he met the accused-appellant at about 1.00 p.m.

who wanted the wih1ess to transport a "spiral". Then the witness declined

his request on the basis he was about to take his due turn for the bus.

However, through his statement to Police, a contradiction was marked that

he did not reply to the accused-appellant's request.

,..2 . --.... ~=.---.------

Contradiction marked as V2 is in relation to a meeting the witness

had with the accused-appellant in the same evening. In his evidence the

witness stated that he met the accused-appellant at about 7.00 p.m.

whereas he has stated in his statement to Police that he met the accused-

appellant at about 7.45 p.m.

Another contradiction was marked as V3 by the accused-appellant

on the witness's statement made to the Police where it is stated that when

the accused-appellant returned to the bus without the deceased, he was

clad in a shirt and a pair of shorts whereas his evidence at the non-

summery InqUIry reveals that the accused-appellant was only clad in a

pair of shorts.

The last of the contradictions, marked V 4, was marked on the

evidence of the witness that he only heard the moan but did not see the

deceased while in his statement the witness has stated that he saw

someone wincing in pain near a canal.

Learned High Court Judge, In evaluating testimonial

trustworthiness of the evidence of this witness, has applied the test of

consistency. She quite correctly concluded that they are in relation to

trivial matters which had no adverse impact on the issue of his credibility

and tTuthfulness. In fairness to the witness, we note that he has repeatedly

stated in evidence that he could not recall every detail of the incident

accurately. This is to be expected as the wih1ess has given evidence 12

years after the incident. In the circumstances, we agree with the learned 5

..

.. 0 _ _ _ _ == J _ u_H ____ _

High Court Judge's conclusion as these four contradictions would not

make the evidence of this witness unreliable or untruthful.

In support of his contention, learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant cited judgments of Wickremasuriya v Dedoleella alld Others

(1996) 2 Sri L.R. and Wi11lalarat1le Siva v Attomey Gelleral (2008) 1 Sri

L.R. 103.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his submissions in reply

referred to the nature of evidence presented by the prosecution against the

accused-appellant. He contended that witness Bandara's evidence relating

to the sequence of events which resulted in the death of the deceased and

him suffering a cut injury on his neck satisfied the tests of spontaneity,

consistency and probability. He further submitted that his evidence was

amply corroborated not only by the witnesses Chandrapala and

KaJ'Lm(lluathie but also by the official witnesses.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General referred to the evidence of Police

officers Wil1w/asiri and Surmueem who conducted investigations.

According to their evidence, the accused-appellant was arrested few hours

after the incident at his house. At the time of arrest, he had a bleeding

injury on his chest and was smelling of liquor. Several items of

productions were recovered after his statement was recorded. These items

of production included a knife with a curved blade. Dr. Neranjan, who

6

/

.-------------------------- --

performed the post mortem examination is of the opinion that the

necessarily fatal injury he noted among the 23 injuries the deceased has

suffered, could have been caused using this knife. The Government

Analyst has identified "blood" on its blade.

In addition, the Government Analyst testified that he identified

human blood on the shirt (P3) recovered from the accused-appellant and

the blood patch was spread from the outer side to the inner side of the

garment.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that therefore the trial

Court has rightly disregarded the inconsistencies which were marked on

trivial aspects of the evidence of the eye wihless and come to the right

conclusion that the accused-appellant was guilty to the charges of murder

and attempted murder. He also invited the attention of this Court to the

nl/ocutus made by the accused-appellant where he has admitted causing

injuries to wihless Bnndnra and sought to explain the mitigatory

circu ms tances.

The only ground of appeal of the accused-appellant is in relation to

proper evaluation of several contradictions in Bnl1dnrn's evidence. The trial

Court has adequately considered them and rightly decided that it has no

adverse effect on the trustworthiness of Bandarn's evidence. It has then

proceeded to convict the accused-appellant on two counts in consideration

7

./

of the evidence presented by the prosecution in its entirety. We are of the

considered view that the complaint by the accused-appellant that Bal1dara's

evidence has not been rejected by the trial Court owing to the highlighted

inconsistencies has no merit. Therefore, we affirm the conviction entered

against the accused-appellant on the two counts.

The trial Court decided not to impose a sentence on the accused-

appellant on the count of attempted murder. We cannot approve the

approach adopted by the trial Court in not imposing a sentence on the

accused-appellant after finding him guilty of the offence of attempted

murder as it has thereby acted contrary to applicable law.

The accused-appellant was found guilty of the offence of attempted

murder. Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

imposes a duty on the trial judge Ii if the verdict is one of c011victio11 pass

sente/lce 011 tile accused according to law." In this instance applicable law

would be the provlsIOns contained in Section 300 of the Penal Code.

Section300 of the Penal Code imposes a mandatory requirement of

imposition of an imprisonment up to 20 years, if hurt is caused as in this

instance. The trial Court must also impose a fine on such an accused. In the

circumstances, this Court ought to correct this error of law.

In consideration of the evidence presented before the trial Court, we

impose 10 years rigorous imprisonment in relation to the charge of

8

attempted murder on the accused-appellant. In addition, a fine of Rs.

5000.00 is also imposed. In default of the fine, the accused-appellant to

serve a further 12 months imprisonment. In the event of the sentences of

imprisonment are carried out, the default term of 12 months imprisonment

should be operative consecutive to the imprisonment of 10 years.

The accused-appellant is entitled to pay the fine within three months

from the date of pronouncement of this judgment by the High Court. We

further direct the relevant High Court to issue a fresh committal in view of

the sentence imposed by this Court.

Accordingly, we make order dismissing the appeal of the accused-

appellant after affirming the conviction. We also affirm the sentence of

death imposed on the charge of murder and impose 10 years

imprisonment on the charge of attempted murder.

DEEP ALI WIIESUNDERA, I.

I agree.
