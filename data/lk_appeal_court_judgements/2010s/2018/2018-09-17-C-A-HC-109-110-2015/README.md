A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The 1 st and the 2nd Accused-Appellants, (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the appellants) along with the 3rd Accused, (deceased) were indicted before the

High Court of Colombo for the murder of Sikandar Bawa Sevi Ashroff Ali and

3

thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32

of the Penal Code. By Judgment dated 16th January 2015, the Appellants were

found guilty, as charged.

The prosecution has relied on two witnesses, who stated that on the date of

the incident the appellant came in search of the deceased late at night, armed with

a knife and took away the deceased by force, down the staircase of the flat the

deceased was living, into a three-wheeler, which was parked outside. When the

deceased had attempted to runaway, the appellants had given chase to the

deceased and brought him back to the three-wheeler where he had sustained

lllJunes.

According to the post mortem report, marked PI, there were 10 stab

injuries located below the waist of the deceased. Except for injury No.2 and 5, the

rest of the injuries were classified as simple/ non grievous injuries with no

corresponding injuries to any internal organ. Injury No.2 and 5 are located on the

thigh and the buttocks of the deceased and according to medical evidence, injury

No.2 is a rupture of a main artery which could have caused death in the ordinary

course of nature.

A knife has been produced marked P2, which has been recovered in terms

of Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance, on a statement given by the 1st

Accused-Appellant. The knife recovered is a pen knife which has been admittedly,

concealed in the purse carried by the 1 st Accused-Appellant.

4

The Counsel appearing for the Appellants, state that they are not

challenging the conviction dated 16/0112015.

In the circumstances, the only ground of appeal that has been urged before

this Court is that;

Whether, the High Court Judge addressed items of evidence in the correct

perspective which would militate against the entering of any murderous intention

by the Accused-Appellants.

Therefore, the Counsel for the appellants urge that the Court consider the

above circumstances and the evidence and to sentence the appellants for a lesser

culpability, under Section 297 of the Penal Code, on the basis of knowledge.

The DSG, appearing for the Respondent objects to the said proposition on

the basis that the Appellants had a clear intention of committing the death of the

deceased when they entered the flat late in the night, armed with a knife. It is

further, submitted that inflicting injuries on the thigh and the buttocks of the

deceased does not negate a murderous intention.

It is observed that the murder weapon used by the Appellant is a pen knife,

which was concealed in a purse in the possession of the appellant. Eight out of the

ten stab injuries inflicted to the legs and buttocks of the deceased are termed as

non grievous injuries. It is observed that the fatal injury which was located on the

thigh of the deceased could not have been intentionally caused, due to the fact that

5

the majority of the injuries were located on the thigh. It is noted that prior to the

incident, there has been no utterances implying causing the peath of the deceased

or the appellants in possession of heavy weapons.

As stated earlier, all the injuries to the deceased are located on the legs and

buttocks, which were caused by the use of a pen knife. If used in an unsafe part of

the human body, a pen knife cannot be undermined. However, the Appellants have

caused the said injuries on the thigh and the buttocks of the deceased.

In the circumstances, we are of the view that at the time of inflicting the

said injuries the appellants could not have entertained a murderous intention to

course the death of the deceased.

Therefore, we are in agreement with the submissions made by the Counsel

for the appellants that the facts and circumstances of this case points to an

inference that the appellants did not entertain any murderous intention to cause the

death of the deceased. Therefore, the conviction and sentence is set aside and we

convict the Accused-Appellants for the offence of culpable homicide, not

amounting to murder in terms of Section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of

knowledge.

Therefore, we sentence the Accused-Appellants for 10 years Rigorous

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,0001- in default six months imprisonment. In

addition we impose Rs. 100,000/- as compensation to be paid to the next of kin by

each of the Accused-Appellants, in default 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment. We

6

also direct that the sentence be implemented from the date of conviction namely,

16/0112015.

The Registrar is directed to send the case record to the registrar of the

Colombo High Court to implement the sentence.

Appeal partly allowed.
