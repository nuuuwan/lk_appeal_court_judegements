P.Padman Surasena,l. (PLCA)

The Petitioner in this application seeks,

i. a writ of certiorari to quash the order dated 23.11.2017 in the appeal

bearing No: AAT/22/2016 (PHC) marked Z of the administrative

appeals tribunal and,

ii. a writ of mandamus directing the 1st - 4th respondents to re-hear the

petitioner's appeal above mentioned.

3,

The Petitioner had been promoted to Class 2 Grade 1 of the Sri Lanka

Animal Production and Health Service with effect from 01.11.1994. His

grievance is that he should have been promoted to Class 1 of the SLAP and

HS (Sri Lanka Animal Production and Health Services).

It is the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Petitioner has had a satisfactory service period of 5 years which is a pre-

requisite to the promotion claimed by him.

It is common ground that the said period of 5 years must be

calculated from 01.11.1994 onwards. The Petitioner does not dispute the

fact that he had been dealt with, in a disciplinary proceedings in respect of

a misconduct which he had committed on 08.10.1999. The said

misconduct had taken place within the required satisfactory period of 5

years.

However, it is the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

that the petitioner has had a satisfactory period of 5 years of service on the

basis that the punishment was imposed on the petitioner on a date after

that period.

,

It is clear that the requirement for the promotion is a satisfactory

service period of 05 years. When an officer had committed a misconduct

on a date which is within that period, this Court is unable to accept such an

officer as an officer who has had a satisfactory period of 05 years on the

basis that punishment was imposed on him for that offence only on a

subsequent date.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court has no legal basis to issue

notices on the respondents. Therefore, this Court decides to refuse to

issue notices on the respondents, and proceeds to dismiss this application

without costs.

Petition is dismissed without costs.

PRESEDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Acuna Obeyesekere,l.

I agree.
