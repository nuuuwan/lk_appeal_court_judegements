This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the North Central Province

holden in Anuradhapura dated 10.11.2006.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) instituted proceedings in the High Court of the North Central

Province holden in Anuradhapura against the Respondents-Respondents (Respondents) and

sought, inter alia, the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing all steps taken by the Respondents to evict the Appellant

from the premises in dispute despite the legal ability to give it to the Appellant;

(b) A writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to act under the provisions of the local

Authorities Housing Act and vest the said premises on the Appellant;

(c) Without prejudice to prayer (b), a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to give

the premises in dispute to the Appellant at least on a rent basis;

(d) An interim order preventing the Respondents from acting under @o. 12 and evicting the

Appellant until the final determination of this application.

The Appellant was at one time an employee of the pt Respondent-Respondent (1st Respondent).

He was provided with a house at No.4 Stadium Cross Road, Anuradhapura from 15.02.1982

(@0.1). He retired from service on 28.03.2001. Then he made an application to vest the said house

on him in terms of the local Authorities Housing Act (@0.6, @0.7 and @0.8). This was rejected

and he was served with a quit notice dated 23.05.2002 issued under section 3(5) of the local

Authorities Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act. Then he invoked the writ jurisdiction of the

High Court of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura.

Writ of Certiorari

The Appellants prayer for a writ of certiorari is misconceived in law. In Dayananda v. Thalwatte

[(2001) 2 SrLL.R.73] this Court held that the failure to specify the writ that is being prayed for

renders the application bad in law. Similarly, where an applicant seeks to quash an exercise of

power due to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety, it must be specified for example

by reference to the particular decision. An applicant for a writ of certiorari cannot call upon the

Court to go on a voyage of discovery by scrutinizing all actions taken by the person exercising

power like in this case where the prayer is for Ita writ of certiorari quashing all steps taken by the

Respondents to evict the Appellant from the premises in dispute despite the legal ability to give

it to the Appellant". That itself is a ground for rejection of relief.

In any event, even if it is contended that the prayer is a reference to the quit notice marked

eo.12, still the application must fail for the reasons set out below.

Clearly the Appellant came into occupation of the premises in dispute on a contractual basis. This

is established by eo.l. The premises in dispute was given to the Appellant as he was an employee

of the pt Respondent. Upon the retirement of the Appellant, the 1st Respondent was entitled to

retake possession. That was a decision taken in the context of the contractual relationship

between parties and a writ of certiorari is not available in those circumstances. In Jayaweera v.

Wijeratne [(1985) 2 SrLL.R. 413] the Court of Appeal held that the case before it was one where

there is an ordinary contractual relationship of principal and agent and therefore the remedy of

certiorari is not available to the petitioner in that case.

In order to overcome this difficulty, the learned Counsel for the Substituted Petitioner-Appellant

(Substituted Appellant) relied on Nanayakkara v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka

and Others [(1981) 2 SrLL.R. 52], Latiff v. Land Reform Commission [(1984) 1 SrLL.R. 118],

Jayaratne v. Wijeratne [(1985) 2 SrLL.R. 413], Ariyaratne v. Sri Lanka Institute of Architects [(2001)

3 SrLL.R. 288] and Ariyaratne v. The National Insurance Corporation and Others [(2003) 2 SrLL.R.

212] and submitted that the relationship between the Appellant and the pt Respondent has a

statutory flavor as the instant dispute does not arise from the rental agreement per se, but from

Page 3 of8

the failure of the Respondents to reasonably exercise the statutory discretion vested in them by

section 3(1) of the Act read with the policy decision reflected in eo.2.

The learned counsel for the Substituted Appellant sought to rely on sections 3(1) and SA of the

Act to establish a right or legitimate expectation on the part of the Appellant to obtain the

premises in dispute. It was his submission that these two sections were stand-alone sections. He

argued that section 3( 1) of the Act gives the pt Respondent discretionary power whereas section

SA of the Act is mandatory in nature.

Section 3(1) of the Act reads:

1/(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, a local authority may, either upon a resolution

passed in that behalf at a duly constituted meeting of that local authority or upon

the direction of the Minister, let to any person any house-

(a) which has vested in that local authority under section 2; or

(b) which has been, or may be, constructed by that local authority within the

administrative limits of that local authority for the purpose of residence,

on such terms as will enable that person to become the owner of that

house and the land appertaining thereto after making certain number of

monthly payments as rent."

Section SA of the Act reads:

1/(1) Where prior to the 15th day of October, 1979, a house to which this Act applies

has been let to any person under the provisions of section 3(1) and the monthly

rental of such house immediately prior to such letting did not exceed twenty-five

rupees, the local authority within the administrative limits of which that house is

situated shall, by an instrument of disposition, transfer, free of charge, that house

to that person.

(2) Where prior to the 15th day of October, 1979, a house to which this Act applies

has been let to any person otherwise than under the provisions of section 3 (1)

and the monthly rental of that house does not exceed twenty-five rupees, the

Page 4 of8

local authority within the administrative limits of which that house is situated

shall, by an instrument of disposition, transfer, free of charge, that house ... "

The fundamental question that arises for determination is whether the house at No.4 Stadium

Cross Road, Anuradhapura comes within the scope and ambit of local Authorities Housing Act

No 14 of 1964 as amended (Act). Section 12 of the Act reads:

" house to which this Act applies" means-

(a) any house which has vested in a local authority under section 2 of this Act, or

(b) any house which has been, or may be, constructed by a local authority for the

purpose of residence within the administrative limits of that local authority;

Section llA of the Act reads:

"Nothing in this Act shall apply to, or in relation to, any house to which this Act applies

which has been let by a local authority to an officer or servant of that local authority as

official quarters."

The letter e-o.1 clearly indicates that the premises in dispute was allocated to the Appellant as

"official quarters". In fact, this is the same conclusion that the Supreme Court arrived at in S.c.

(F/R) 63/2013. That was a fundamental rights application filed by the Appellant against the

Respondents alleging that he had a legitimate expectation of becoming the owner of the house

he was occupying in terms of the Act. The Appellant claimed he was occupying a house built by

the State under the "low cost housing scheme" which is now vested in the pt Respondent. The

Supreme Court further took the view that there is nothing to indicate that the house at No.4

Stadium Cross Road, Anuradhapura is a low-cost house.

The learned Counsel for the Substituted Appellant has gone to great lengths to try and establish

that this finding of the Supreme Court was based on insufficient evidence. I have no hesitation is

rejecting this submission. It is the Appellant who filed the application in the Supreme Court and

the burden was on him to place all relevant material to assist the Supreme Court in its

Page 5 of 8

determination of the application. If that has not happened it is the fault of the Appellant and not

the Supreme Court.

In any event, it is clear on the evidence before Court that section SA of the Act applies only where

prior to the 15th day of October, 1979, a house to which this Act applies has been let to any person

under the provisions of section 3(1) of the Act. According to @o.l, the premises in dispute was

given to the Appellant from 15.02.1982. This is one of the grounds relied upon by the learned

High Court Judge to reject the application of the Appellant and I am in agreement with this

conclusion.

The learned Counsel for the Substituted Appellant has submitted that "official quarters" referred

to in section llA of the Act must be read as referring to "scheduled quarters" of which there are

only seven within the purview of the pt Respondent and the premises in dispute is not one of

them and therefore falls within the purview of the Act. There was no such evidence before the

High Court and I have no hesitation in rejecting this subtle attempt to bring in new facts by way

of written submissions.

Accordingly, the Appellant has failed to contradict that the relationship between the Appellant

and the 1st Respondent is based per se on the rental agreement. He has also failed to establish

that the premises in dispute comes within the scope and ambit of the Act.

There is the further issue of failure to exhaust alternative remedies.

The general principle is that an individual should normally use alternative remedies where

available rather than judicial review [R. (Davies) v. Financial Services Authority (2004) 1 W.L.R.

185; R. (G) Immigration Appeal Tribunal (200s) 1 W.L.R. 1445]. Our Courts have held that where

a party fails to invoke alternative remedies judicial review can be refused. [Rodrigo v. Municipal

Council Galle (49 N.L.R. 89); Gunasekera v. Weerakoon (73 N.L.R. 262); Obeysekera v. Albert &

others (1978-79) 2 SrLL.R. 220); Rev. Maussagolle Dharmarakkitha Thero and another v. Registrar

of Lands and others (200s) 3 SrLL.R. 113]. The general principle is applicable even where the

alternative remedy is an administrative procedure, such as in this case and Courts will require

the party seeking judicial review first to exhaust such administrative procedure before invoking

the discretionary power of judicial review [R (Cowl) v. Plymouth City Council (2002) 1 W.L.R. 803;

Page 6 of 8

R. v. Barking and Dagenham LBC Ex. P. Lloyd (2001) L.G.R. 421; R. (Carnell) v. Regents Park College

and Conference of Colleges Appeal Tribunal (2008) E.L.R. 739].

In order to negate such a principle, the learned Counsel for the Substituted Appellant relied on

the decision in Somasunderam v. Forbes [(1993) 2 SrLL.R. 362] and the reference by

Bandaranayake J. (at page 367) to Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Ed., Vol. II) page 805 at

paragraph 1528 which reads:

"There is no rule in certiorari as there is in mandamus, that it will lie only where there is

no other equally effective remedy, and provided the requisite grounds exist, certiorari will

lie although a right of appeal has been conferred by statute."

However, Bandaranayake J. in fact held (at page page 369):

"On the other hand there may be instances where the law provides for satisfactory relief

under the statute. A Court may in the exercise of its discretion withhold review in such

situations. But it is the duty of the Court to consider whether certiorari is more

appropriate in the circumstances."

The quit notice marked <3'0.12 was issued under section 3(1) of the Local Authority Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Law No. 42 of 1978. Section 2 of the said Law states that the provisions

of this Law (a) shall apply to all local authority quarters and (b) shall be deemed at all times to

have been, and to be, an implied condition of the occupation by persons of such quarters.

Section 4(1) of the said Law gives any person aggrieved by the service of a quit notice the right

to appeal to the Minister. In terms of section 4(2) of the said Law, where an appeal is preferred

under subsection (1) the quit notice served on the appellant in respect of such quarters shall

cease to take effect till the determination of the appeal. Section 4(3) of the said Law states that

the Minister may, on an appeal under subsection (1), make an order (a) allowing the appeal or

(b) disallowing the appeal wholly or subject to the condition that the execution of the quit notice

shall be stayed for the period stated in the order.

Page 7 of 8

In my view these provisions clearly establish that the administrative remedy provided in the said

Law is adequate and efficacious. The Appellant failed to exhaust the statutory right of appeal.

This was a matter considered by the learned High Court Judge in rejecting the application of the

Appellant. I see no reason to disagree with the learned High Court Judge.

For the foregoing reasons, the application for a writ of certiorari must fail.

Writ of Mandamus

In Weligama Multi Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. v. Daluwatte [(1984) 1 Sri.L.R. 195] the

Supreme Court held that Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty, in the

performance of which an applicant has sufficient legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus

the duty to be performed must be of a public nature and not of a merely private character. A

public duty may be imposed by statute, charter or the common law or custom.

The learned High Court concluded that the Appellant has failed to establish a public duty to vest

the premises in dispute on him. In view of the factual matters referred to earlier, I am in

agreement with this conclusion of the learned High Court Judge. Hence the application for a writ

of mandamus must fail.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura dated 10.11.2006.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
