DECIDED ON

Sharon Serasinghe for the Accused-Appellant

P. Kumararathnam DSG for the Respondent

14.09.2018

M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant)

was convicted by the High Court of Jaffna for committing an offence of

murder of Captain Upali Ralapanawa (herein after referred to as the

'deceased) on or about 15th May 2007 at Kankesanthurai, Jaffna,

thereby, committing an offence punishable under Section 296 of the

Penal Code.

2

The respective charge made against the Appellant in the

indictment was read out him and the Appellant pleaded not guilty to

the said charge and opted for a trail without jury.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge of

Jaffna found the Appellant guilty of the offence of murder and

sentenced him to death on 28th May 2015

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the

Appellant preferred this appeal, seeking to set aside the judgment

dated 28th May 2015, delivered by the learned High Court Judge of

Jaffna.

Counsel for the Appellant raised the following grounds of

appeal:

1. It is not safe to convict the Appellant for murder when he

was not given a fair trial.

2. It is not safe to convict the Appellant on the evidence of

PW3 which is not credible or not corroborated by the

witnesses.

The prosecution case briefly reads as follows:

On the day of the incident the deceased had been engaged in

his official duties at the 4th Military Unit situated at Kankesanthurai

where the Appellant had entered the said office armed with aT-56

automatic rifle and by firing such weapon has caused the death of the

deceased. The Prosecution relied on the evidence of Unagolle

Pallegedera Seneviratne who was an eye-witness to this incident.

3

According to this witness which is recorded at page 67 and 68 in the

translated brief, he had seen the Appellant firing at the Captain

Ralapanawa in front of the office which he was doing his official duties

around 3.15 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. on the said date. Having stated 20 feet

away from just opposite place where Ralapanawa stayed he saw this

incident. He was behind the office of Captain. Ralapanawa when the

firing took place. According to his evidence he has clearly seen that

the appellant shooting Captain Ralapanawa and carrying the gun

entered into his office too. In the evidence given before the prosecution

case there is no omission or contradiction marked according to the

brief.

According to witness Galkotuwe Gedera Sarath Weerasinghe

the Appellant has been issued the T-56 marked 21013172 with 4

magazines and 120 bullets. Soon after the incident this weapon has

been recovered in the possession of the Appellant.

Witness Udeya Kumara Jayasekera giving evidence states that

he took charge of the T -56 gun and the magazine, 15 bullets and has

handed over the said productions to the Police Station. The said

productions have been sent to the Government Analyst for

examination and the said report has been marked as P4 which has

been accepted by the counsel appearing for the Appellant.

One of the grounds of the appeal is that it is unsafe to rely

upon the evidence of PW3 which has not been corroborated by any of

the official witnesses. PW3 was the only witness who had knowledge of

the rifle between the deceased and the appellant and also his

testimony was prompt and there are no contradictions or

commissions.

4

It is trite law that when a witness giving cogent, inspiring and truthful

testimony in a court, the trial judge do not incline to accept that

witness.

In Sumanasena V. Attorney General (1999) 3 S.L.R 137 it was held that:-

"Evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a court of law.

When the prosecution establishes strong and incriminating cogent

evidence against the accused, the accused in those circumstances was

required in law to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating

circumstances established against him. JJ

In Upali Sarathchandra & Others vs. Republic of Sri Lanka

(2005) 2 S.L.R. 267, the Court had carefully analysed and evaluated

and weighed the evidence of the 12 year old eye witness and was

convinced that he had given cogent and truthful testimony in court,

also by observing the demeanour and deportment of this witness.

Jagath Balapatabendi and Imam JJ Further held that "no particular

number of witnesses shall in any case be required for proof of any fact.

Evidence must not be counted but weighed.

Same approaches followed in WaUmunige John vs. State, 76 N.L.R.

488 and K vs. Davodulebbe, 50 N.L.R. 274

Thus the court could have acted on the evidence of the victim provided

the trial Judge was convinced that PW3 was giving cogent, inspiring

and truthful testimony in court.

The next ground for appeal is that the appellant was not given the fair

trial. But after conclusion of the case the Appellant was gIven an

opportunity and he has made a dock statement. In his Dock

Statement he has only said that "I do not murder Captain Ralapanawa

on 15.05.2007 and 1 state that 1 did know to tell anything about it. JJ

-,

5

According to the prosecution, they have established their case beyond

reasonable doubt and the court given a fair opportunity in order to

explain his previous position to show is there any exception or any

mitigatory circumstances according to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

But according to the prosecution as well as the defence evidence

nothing comes out in this nature. Therefore the reasons set out in the

case, we are not incline to set aside the judgment dated 28.05.2015

delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Jaffna.

Therefore, we affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

Appellant; and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
