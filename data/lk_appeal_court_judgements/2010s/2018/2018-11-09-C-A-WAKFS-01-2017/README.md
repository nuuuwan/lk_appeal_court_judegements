The Petitioner-Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellants")

in this case filed this appeal against the judgment delivered on 15.07.2017 by the

Wakfs Tribunal, affirming the order made by the Wakfs Board of Sri Lanka dated

08.12.2016 and dismissing the said Appeal.

In this case, the following facts are noteworthy:-

The Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent") and the Appellants had entered in to a Deed of Trust bearing No.

288 dated 03.03.2005, for the purpose of and, inter alia to establish,

a) A masjid called "AI-Rahman Jummah Mosque";

b) An Arabic College named AI-Rahman Arabic College;

c) Uduman Medical Centre and

d) AI-Rahman burial ground.

The other purposes for which the trust is created are described in Paragraph 2 of

the said Deed of Trust (marked as "X4"). Upon the execution of this Deed of

Trust No. 288, the Respondent (the Settlor) had been accepted by the Appellants

as their religious Leader and in turn the Respondent nominated the Appellants as

trustees of AI-Rahman Jummah Mosque. On the recommendation of the Settlor-

Respondent, the Wakfs Board had appointed the Appellants as trustees on two

consecutive terms; the last term expired on 27.08.2011. Thereafter, the

Appellants functioned as person-in-charge, as no trustees were appointed for the

said Mosque.

The Respondent stated that he was compelled to delay his new nomination of

Trustees to the Wakfs Board until he was able to resolve some new issues (vide,

written Submission of the Respondent, para 19 (a) to (f)) created by the above

said existing persons-in-charge of the said mosque. He further submitted that

due to the circumstances enumerated above, the Respondent was forced to take

disciplinary action against the trustees of the AI-Rahman Trust by using his

power vested him under the said Trust Deed No. 288. Therefore, the Respondent

had amended the Deed of Trust No. 288 by executing another Deed of trust No.

3069 dated 11th April 2016 attested by U. A. Mawjooth, Notary Public (marked as

"X11").

By this amended Deed of Trust No. 3069 the Respondent removed all 13

persons previously appointed as trustees of AI-Rahman Trust under the Deed of

Trust No. 288 and appointed 13 new persons in place of the removed trustees as

new trustees of the Trust. Subsequent to executing the new Deed of Trust the

Respondent had informed the Wakfs Board of Sri Lanka and the Director,

Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs regarding the changes and

he also nominated and recommended to the Wakf Board all 13 newly appointed

trustees of AI-Rahman Trust to appoint as new trustees of the said mosque in

terms of the provisions contained in the trust instruments referred to above.

4

While the Settlor's above said nomination of 13 new trustees of the Mosque was

under consideration of the Wakf Board, the Appellants filed an application to

object the new 13 persons being appointed as trustees of the said mosque (vide,

54 of the appeal brief). In the Wakfs Board, the Respondent's Counsel in his oral

submissions inter alia objected to the Appellants' application being considered by

the Wakfs Board due to patent lack of jurisdiction to grant the substantial reliefs

the Appellants were seeking from the Wakfs Board. Counsel for the Appellants

also made his oral submission in reply to preliminary objection raised by the

Counsel for the Respondent. After hearing of both parties the Wakf Board made

an order on 08.12.2016 and dismissed the Appellant's application.

The Appellants thereafter filed an appeal dated 06.01.2017 under and in terms of

Section 9H of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act, No 51 of

1965 (Sometimes referred to as the "Wakfs Act") in the Wakf Tribunal, against

the order made by the Wakfs Board seeking inter alia some substantive reliefs as

contained in their application. (Vide, page 80 of the Appeal brief).After hearing

the oral and written submissions made by both parties, the Wakfs Tribunal also

dismissed the Appellants' appeal.

In the Wakf Tribunal the Appellants sought the following reliefs:

a) To stay the order issued by the Wakfs Board on 08.12.2016;

b) To nullify the new deed (Deed of Trust) No. 3069 dated 11.04.2016

c) To direct the Director of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs not to

appoint any persons as trustees until the final determination of the case;

d) To hold an inquiry in this matter and issue a decree to amend the trust

deed in order to curb the powers vested to the Respondent in Section

(6) in the Trust Deed No. 288

e) To make order to take necessary steps to appoint Appellants as the

Trustees to the AI-Rahman Jummah Mosque.

However, after my careful perusal of the documents contained in the brief, it is

crystal clear that the Wakfs Board of Sri Lanka had correctly dismissed the

application (including above mentioned reliefs) filed by the Appellants for the

reason that it would be ultra vires for the Board to entertain the said application,

since the Petitioners sought relief under Section 9E (1) of the Wakf Act which is

specify the general powers of the Wakfs Tribunal. The learned Chairman of the

Tribunal also held that the Appellants were on a misconception of law, had gone

before the Wakfs Board with their petition seek the reliefs prayed for in their

petition. Because, the Wakfs Board has no jurisdiction to entertain their petition

as the matter stated in Section 9E are clearly falling under the General Powers

of the Tribunal.

"Muslim Charitable Trust is a matter which comes under the

jurisdiction of the Wakfs Tribunal and not within the Wakfs Board. Any

dispute arising over this matter must be referred to the Tribunal. In this

case, the relief asked for to amend clause (6) in the Deed of Trust No.

288 and revoke the new Deed of trust No. 3069 are matters relating to

trust which fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. ... " (Page 6 -

Judgment of the Wakfs Tribunal).

Therefore, I am of the view that the Wakfs Tribunal has correctly evaluated the

issue.

In this case, the Appellant's another submission was (in the Wakfs Board and the

Tribunal) that the said Deed of Trust No. 3069 should be nullified. The same

submission is further demarcated in their written submission (in this Court) as

follows:-

" .... the Respondent only activating after 6 years to nominate the

trustees with malicious intention to insert persons in to trust whom

believed in Respondent religious ideology and believes. These

matters were placed in the Wakfs Board petitions but Wakf Board

failed to take into consideration." (para 6 (i))

6

Before dealing this submission/issue made by the Appellants, the following

factual substances are important:-

1. The Settlor-Respondent and the Appellants had agreed that the provisions

of the Wakfs Act as amended thereafter shall and will apply to the above

said trust.

2. It is also admitted by the parties that though this Trust has been created

by Deed No. 288, it is not recognized up to now. Only the AI-Rahman

Jummah Mosque is registered and the trustees are appointed only for the

mosque and not for the trust. Therefore, the trust is not a matter for

consideration in this case.

Under clause (6) in the Deed of Trust No. 288, the Settlor (its means that

a person who creates a trust-legal arrangement to manage the assets of

someone else-and puts money, property, etc. into it, even so, the Deed No. 288

indicates as "Settler") as stated above, has the powers to:-

a) Select or nominate the trustee or trustees to be appointed by the Wakfs

Board of Sri Lanka in terms of Section 14(1)(A) of the Muslim Mosques

and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act;

b) Take disciplinary action against a Trustee or Trustees;

c) Fill the vacancy and no decision of the Settlor shall be invalidated by

reason only of such decision being made pending the filling of any

vacancy in the office of Trustees;

d) The decision of Fatwa of the Settlor shall be final and conclusive on all

disputes or ideological controversies and shall not be called in question by

the Trustee or Trustees.

Therefore, it is not disputed that in terms of the powers vested in the Settlor-

Respondent, he has the sole right and authority to select or nominate the

trustees and his decision is final and conclusive and shall not called in question

by the trustees, and therefore, the trustees have no right to question the

appointment of the new trustees.

Further, it is important that the Deed of Trust No. 288 does not have any clause

or condition for the trustees to amend or vary the terms and conditions of the

trust deed, including clause (6). If they want to do any acts as stated in Clauses

(3), (4) and (5) they must do so with the written consent of the Settlor-

Respondent. Thus the powers of the Trustees are clearly restricted and they

cannot do any act without the written consent of the Respondent.

Furthermore, the Settlor has been granted further power that,

"He shall and will from time to time hereafter do and execute or cause

to be done and executed all such acts, deeds, matters and thing

whatsoever for the further and more perfectly assuring the said trust

premises in the Trustees in the manner aforesaid as shall are may be

reasonably required" (See: para 3 in page 4 of Deed No. 288)

Therefore, as pointed out above, both the Wakfs Board and Wakf Tribunal had

followed their correct procedure in making appointment of 13 new Trustees and

dismissing the Appellants' appeal. Thus, there is no merit in this appeal and the

appellants are not entitled in law to seek any reliefs as prayed for their petition.

Therefore, I affirm the Wakf Tribunal's judgment dated 15.07.2017 and dismiss

this appeal without Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
