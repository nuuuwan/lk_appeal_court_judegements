ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

and 2nd Appellants) were indicted before the High Court of Tangalle for

committing the murder of Mahakumburage Dharmadasa on or about 19th

January 2000. Upon their election to be tried without a jury, the Appellants

were convicted for murder and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellants,

at the hearing of this appeal, complained that the trial Court has

erroneously held that general exception of sudden fight is not applicable

upon the evidence presented before it and as a result they were denied of

its benefit of lesser culpability.

The prosecution case is that the deceased and witness Jayantha were

walking along a public road to a relative's house in the evening of 19th

January 2000. They had to walk along the edge of the road to give way to a

vehicle which went past them. Then he saw the two Appellants and the

deceased are engaged in a scuffle as one bunch. At that time the deceased

was rested on the bank of the side drain with his two feet in the drain. The

2nd Appellant has held the deceased by his two hands while the 1st

Appellant had stabbed on his chest twice.

2

When he raised cries witness Sumanasena rushed in and the two

Appellants ran away from the scene. The deceased was thereafter taken to

hospital and on his way had made a declaration implicating the two

Appellants as the persons who stabbed him. The medical evidence

revealed that the deceased had suffered three stab wounds on his chest

and one stab on his abdomen. The corresponding internal injury to the

penetrating stab injury on the abdomen was on the aorta and it had been

cut about 2/3. This injury had resulted in the death of the deceased which

in turn caused loss of blood. He could have talked for a while.

After the arrest of the 1st Appellant, a knife was recovered.

According to the medical witness it may have been used to cause the stab

injuries to the deceased.

In support of the solitary ground of appeal, learned Counsel for the

Appellants submitted that it was a chance meeting and the deceased had

suffered these injuries during a sudden fight. About a year ago the

deceased had inflicted a cut injury on the 1st Appellant. However, he

contended that there was no evidence of premeditation. The trial Court,

even though the evidence suggested a sudden fight, deprived them of the

benefit of lesser culpability, in convicting the Appellants for murder.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General supported the conviction of

murder on the basis that there was no suggestion by the Appellants that it

3

was a case of sudden fight or of an instance of exercising their right of

private defence, in view of their claim that the deceased was armed with a

knife. She further submitted that in concluding that the Appellants have

committed murder, the trial Court had considered the evidence placed

before it quite meticulously and arrived at the determination that it was a

premeditated attack.

This Court, in the judgment of CA 131/2000, C.A.M. of 10.09.2008,

held in respect of exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code that;

" ... in order to derive the benefit of this special exception, the

following ingredients willlzave to be fulfilled.

(a) The suddenness of the fight should be common to all

participants and should not be one sided where one of

the assailants with deliberate design to exploit the

situation wades in and launches an assault.

(b) The quarrel should be sudden to all antagonists

generating instantaneous heat of passion under the

influence of which the offence is committed.

(c) The offender should not have an undue advantage such

as attacking a defenceless unarmed person with a

deadly weapon.

(d) The offender should not have acted in a cruel or

unusual manner such as dealing repeated stab blows

with great force on a defenceless adversary, where the

4

intention to kill is not the product of passion generated

instantaneously but more likely springing from malice

or vindictiveness." (emphasis original)

In addition, it was also held that " ... the burden of proof that the

circumstances come within the ambit of the plea of sudden fight devolves on the

offender on a balance of probability. Where one or more of the several elements that

needs to be proved are in doubt in relation to independent circumstances in each

case, then the plea cannot be said to be proved and therefore fail."

When the above quoted principles are applied on the evidence

placed before the trial Court in the instant appeal, it is obvious that the

Appellants cannot claim the benefit of the exception of sudden fight.

The deceased was unarmed and was on his way to a relative's house

and was surprised with a well-coordinated attack. Apparently, the

deceased had lost his balance on account of this sudden attack and was

resting against the bank of the side drain with his feet in the drain. He was

held immobile by the 2nd Appellant while the 1st Appellant stabbed him

four times on his chest and abdomen, resulting in a necessarily fatal injury

on the aorta. The fact that the stabbing took place while the deceased was

pinned to the bank of the side drain by the 2nd Appellant is a clear

indication that the two Appellants have acted according to a pre-planned

strategy in which the role each of them had to play in the attack was

thought about.

5

There was no evidence that one of the Appellants have instructed

the other to carry out what each of them did by uttering clear verbal

instructions just before the stabbing. When each of them carried out their

specific part in the stabbing, that clearly supports the view there was

premeditation. They saw the deceased coming along the public road and

have quickly decided on the strategy of their attack and used the passing

vehicle as the best opportunity to mount their surprise attack on the

deceased as his companion was on the other side of the road. The finding

of fact by the trial Court that there was premeditation is a correct

conclusion on the available evidence.

In addition, the repeated acts of stabbing on the deceased without

any provocation on his part clearly negates any application of the

exception of sudden fight since the Appellants have acted in cruel or

unusual manner. The claim by the 1st Appellant that it was the deceased

who wielded a knife and had got injured during the scuffle was clearly an

afterthought introduced through his evidence for the first time in the trial

without suggesting it into any of the lay witnesses who had seen the attack

on the deceased. Therefore, the Appellant's have failed to discharge their

burden in relation to the exception of sudden fight.

In view of the above reasoning we are of the considered view that

the ground of appeal raised by the Appellants is devoid of any merit and

therefore ought to be rejected. 6

, .

The conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellants by the High

Court of Tangalle is hereby affirmed. The appeal of the 1st and 2nd

Appellants is accordingly dismissed.
