This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Uva Province holden in

(Respondents) in the above styled application filed by the Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant).

The Appellar,lt was a graduate teacher in the Provincial Public Service of the Uva Province. He was

taken into custody by the Police on 09.06.1999 and produced in the Magistrates Court of Badulla

on a complaint made by a student, who will be referred to as "X" in these proceedings, alleging

that she was raped by the Appellant on three occasions.

Thereafter, the Appellant was interdicted by letter dated 11.08.1999 (P11). While the above

criminal proceedings were pending, the Appellant was issued a charge sheet under the

Establishments Code (E-Code) and after a formal disciplinary inquiry he was found guilty of all

charges and dismissed from service by letter dated 17.06.2002 (P21). The Appellant appealed to

the Provincial Public Service of the Uva Province which was rejected by letter dated 13.01.2003

(P24). He then preferred an appeal to the Governor which was also rejected by letter dated

15.10.2003 (P26).

The Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Badulla in Case No. 36/2002 on the charge of

rape of "X" and after a trial which spanned six years, he was acquitted and discharged as the

prosecution had failed to prove the charge against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt (P30).

The Appellant then appealed to the Governor requesting that he be reinstated in view of his

acquittal by the High Court (P31). The Governor rejected his appeal by letter dated 12.06.2013

(P35).

The Appellant then filed the above styled application before the Provincial High Court of the Uva

Province holden in Badu"a and sought inter alia:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the said decision of the Governor contained in P35;

(b) A writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 6th Respondents to reinstate him as prayed for in

the prayer to the petition.

The learned High Court Judge refused to issue notice on the Respondents and hence this appeal

by the Appellant.

Page 4 of9

The learned counsel for the Appellant urged two grounds in appeal. They are:

'.

(a) The charges of the disciplinary inquiry were based on the alleged commission of the

criminal offence and therefore the acquittal of the Appellant by the High Court

necessitates revisiting the disciplinary order;

(b) The disciplinary inquiry was ultra vires and a nullity and the Appellant could not have been

tried for a criminal offense in a disciplinary inquiry

Acquittal Necessitates Revisiting the Disciplinary Order

The disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant began when the E-Code provisions was

applicable to the Provincial Public Service of the Uva Province. The charge sheet issued to the

Appellant (P13) specified charges falling under the First Schedule of chapter XLVIII of Vol. II of the

E-Code. Altogether there were three charges. The first was improper conduct not inconformity

with the teacher service, second was attempting to outrage the modesty of student fiX" and third

was bringing disrepute to the office of the Appellant and the public service in general by the

aforesaid conduct. As far as the criminal proceedings were concerned the charge was rape.

Clearly the charges in the criminal case and the disciplinary proceedings were different.

Accordingly, submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant that the charges of the

disciplinary inquiry were based on the alleged commission of the criminal offence and therefore

the acquittal of the Appellant by the High Court necessitates revisiting the disciplinary order is

misconceived in law and in fact.

In any event, the burden of proof in the two proceedings are different as the charges under the

Penal Code in the High Court has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt whereas the charges in

the disciplinary proceedings must be proved on a balance of probability.

Furthermore, chapter XLVIII: sections 27:11 of the E-Code indicates that there is no barrier to a

departmental inquiry being conducted against a public officer whilst criminal proceedings are in

progress against that public officer for an offence which falls under the E-Code. The section states

that the Disciplinary Authority should hold a disciplinary inquiry independent of the court

proceedings in progress and should only suspend or postpone the inquiry for compelling reasons

Page 5 of9

and unavoidable obstacles. The fact that both proceedings can be done in parallel is further

\ supported by section 27:6 of the E-Code. This section requires the Head of Department or a staff

officer to retain certified copies of any documents that are handed over to relevant authorities

for legal proceedings, if those documents may become necessary for a disciplinary inquiry against

the accused public officer. The retention of certified copies for the disciplinary inquiry is thus

mandated because the original documents will be in the custody of courts in a parallel court

proceeding.

Further, section 27:12 of the E-Code states that court proceedings still being in progress will not

inhibit a disciplinary order being made at the end of the disciplinary inquiry. Section 27:13 of the

E-Code states that a court order being made against the public officer should not inhibit the

disciplinary inquiry if it is still in progress and that it should be concluded and an appropriate

disciplinary order made unless there are unavoidable obstacles to the continuation of the

disciplinary inquiry. These sections reinforce the proposition that both proceedings can be

conducted in parallel.

The question whether parallel proceedings could be conducted when both proceedings deal with

the same charges/offences is also answered in the affirmative by the E-Code. Section 27:11 of

the E-Code requires the relevant disciplinary authority to hold an independent disciplinary

inquiry even where court proceedings for an offence which falls within the Code are in progress.

Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the disciplinary authority can normally inquire

into the offence that is already before court in addition to other relevant offences. This

conclusion is strengthened when one considers section 27:15 of the E-Code. The section

envisages departmental inquiries and court proceedings being held Iwith regard to a charge or a

series of charges' and states that the fact that the officer is acquitted in the Court proceedings

should in no way affect the implementing of the disciplinary order made on the matters

revealed in the departmental disciplinary inquiry. Similarly, section 27:14 of the E-Code states

that a public officer who has been acquitted of a charge or series of charges at a departmental

inquiry but found guilty of the same charges at a Court of law, could still be dealt with in terms

of the Code. Therefore, the provisions of the Establishments Code make it very clear that parallel

Page 6 of9

"

proceedings \ can be conducted against a public officer even in relation to the same

charge/offence.

Section 28:6 of the E-Code unequivocally states that the fact that an officer has been acquitted

or discharged or found not guilty by a Court of Law is no reasons at all why he should not be dealt

with under the E-Code, if there is sufficient material on which disciplinary proceedings can be

taken against him.

Section 28:7 of the E-Code states that an officer who has been punished under the E-Code for

any offence, other than a punishment in terms of sub-section 28:3 therein, may not claim

remission of such punishment on the ground that he has subsequently been acquitted or

discharged by a court of law in respect of that same offence or that the order of a Court has been

set aside in appeal.

By the time the Appellant preferred an appeal to the Governor based on his acquittal by the High

Court, the Governor of the Uva Province had promulgated a new Disciplinary Procedure for the

Uva Provincial Public Service (Uva Disciplinary Procedure) containing similar provisions to the E-

Code provisions. Sections 28.6 and 28.7 are the same as the corresponding provisions in the E-

Code. Furthermore, section 27.15 of the Uva Disciplinary Procedure is the same as clause 27.15

of the E-Code and it is this provision that the Governor refers to in rejecting the appeal of the

Appellant by P35.

The Supreme Court in D.M. Anura Mongolo v. The Inspector General of Police and others [(S.C.F.R.

Application No. 273/2014, S.C.M. 04.06.2015] was called upon to consider a similar issue as in

the instant case and Gooneratne J. (at page 7) held that the High Court case filed against the

Petitioner in that case would have no bearing on the disciplinary order made against the

Petitioner in that case although the Petitioner was acquitted in the High Court. The learned

counsel for the Appellant submitted that in D.M. Anura Mongolo's case (supra) the charges

amounted to an offence under the E-Code whereas in this case molesting a girl is not an offence

under the E-Code.

Page 7of9

This submission must be addressed although I must say it was quite surprising that such a

submission was ever made. The three charges against the Appellant in the disciplinary

proceedings were improper conduct not inconformity with the teacher service, attempting to

outrage the modesty of student fiX" and bringing disrepute to the office of the Appellant and the

public service in general by the aforesaid conduct. The student flX" was a student of the school

the Appellant was a teacher. Clearly these charges fall under the First schedule to the E-Code

read with the meaning given to flimproper conduct" in Appendix 1 of Vol. I of E-Code.

The same issue as in the instant case also came up before me in Jayalath Pedige Prema Jayantha

v. Secretary Chief Ministry, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council [CA. (PHC) 182/2008, C.A.M.

29.06.2018] where the court came to a similar conclusion.

For the foregoing reasons, the Governor acted within jurisdiction in rejecting the appeal of the

Appellant and the learned High Court Judge was correct in concluding that there were no prima

facie reasons to interfere with the decision of the Governor.

Disciplinary Inquiry Ultra Vires and a Nullity

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the charges on which the disciplinary

proceedings against the Appellant were held are criminal in nature and therefore the disciplinary

authority must await the outcome of the criminal proceedings and further disciplinary action can

be taken only where there is a conviction by in the criminal proceedings.

I have no hesitation in rejecting this submission. As I have pointed out above, the three charges

against the Appellant was not based on the criminal charge in the High Court. The E-Code clearly

permits disciplinary proceedings to be taken independent of the criminal proceedings. In fact,

section 28:7 of the E-Code states that an officer who has been punished under the E-Code for

any offence, other than a punishment in terms of sub-section 28:3 therein, may not claim

remission of such punishment on the ground that he has subsequently been acquitted or

discharged by a court of law in respect of that same offence or that the order of a Court has been

set aside in appeal.

, .

There is also: a procedural defect in the application of the Appellant. There is already an order by

the Governor rejecting the appeal made by the Appellant against the finding of guilt in the

disCiplinary proceedings (P26). That has not been challenged by the Appellant. But he seeks to

strike down the order made by the Governor rejecting his appeal after his acquittal by the High

Court (P35). Even if it is assumed that P35 can be quashed by a writ of certiorari, there is an

existing decision by the Governor rejecting the appeal made by the Appellant against the

disciplinary order.

The learned counsel for the Appellant contends that the disciplinary inquiry itself was ultra vires

and a nullity. It is not for the reasons set out earlier. In any event, there must be a formal quashing

of the decision even if it is ultra vires and a nullity. It was occasionally suggested in the past that

a quashing order should not be used to quash nullities on the grounds that if a decision is a nullity

it cannot produce legal effects, and so does not need to be quashed. This line of reasoning is

misplaced. The purpose of granting a quashing order is to establish invalidity and, once

established, to make it clear that the decision is devoid of legal effect [ Lewis, judicial Remedies

in Public Law, 5th Ed., page 209].

In these circumstances, there can be no public or statutory duty requiring the reinstatement of

the Appellant and therefore a writ of mandamus will not lie.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Uva Province holden in Badulla dated 25th November 2013.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
