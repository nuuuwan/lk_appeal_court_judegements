JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The pt and 2nd Accused Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as Petitioners)

are the pt and 2nd Accused in the High Court of Colombo case. They have

filed this revision application seeking the intervention of this Court to set

aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 2017-07-26. This

order has been made pursuant to an application made on behalf of the

Petitioners, to recall two witnesses namely the witness Srimathie

Wijerathne and witness Ridma Tharangani for cross-examination for a

second time.

It is on the basis that these two witnesses had given contradictory

evidence in another case subsequent to the conclusion of their evidence in

the instant case, that the learned counsel for the Petitioners had supported

that application.

According to the submissions of the learned counsel as well as the material

in the brief, it is in the year 20121 that the learned counsel who appeared

for the Petitioners in the High Court, had initially made this application.

Hon. W Irangani Perera, the then presiding High Court Judge had made an

order on 2017-07-31 with regard to this application. It has been held in

1 Vide proceedings of 2012-06-27 produced marked P (1) b at page 395 of the brief.

that order that the Court would grant an opportunity for the Petitioners to

satisfy Court whether it should allow that application. The basis for the said

order appears to be the fact that the Petitioners had failed to submit

relevant material for the consideration of the Court. The perusal of the said

order dated 2013-07-31 clearly shows that the Court had not decided on

the said application on that date but had merely afforded another

opportunity for the Petitioners to adduce before Court the relevant material

to enable the Court to decide on the application made by them.

The same High Court Judge2 in a subsequent order made on 2014-01-30

had erroneously stated that she had granted permission for the Petitioners

to recall the said witnesses for cross-examination by her order dated 2013-

07-31. The said order dated 2014-01-30 has been produced marked P {ll

d. However perusal of her previous order dated 2013-07-31 clearly shows

that no such permission has ever been granted to the Petitioners.

It could be seen that the Petitioners seek to challenge the order dated

2017-07-26 made by the incumbent High Court Judge.

This challenge is on the basis that the previous High Court Judge3 had

allowed the application by her order dated 2013-07-31.

For the reasons set out above, this Court is of the opinion that the said

order dated 2013-07-31 is clearly an erroneous order. Therefore, that order

should not have any force in law. Learned incumbent High Court judge is

correct in holding that view.

Perusal of indictment relevant to this case shows that the date, the alleged

offence is said to have been committed is 2004-05-28. Upon consideration

of the material adduced on behalf of the Petitioners, this Court is unable to

find any justification as to why the application made on behalf of the

Petitioners should have been allowed by the learned High Court Judge.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that it has no basis to

interfere with the order dated 2017-07-26 pronounced by the learned High

Court Judge. Thus, this Court decides to refuse to issue notices on the

Respondents. This revision application must therefore stand dismissed.

This Court makes no order for costs.

Application is dismissed.
