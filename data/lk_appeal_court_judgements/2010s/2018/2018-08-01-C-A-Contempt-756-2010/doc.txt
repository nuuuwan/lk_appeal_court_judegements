Respondents

Manohara de Silva, PC with Imalka Abeysinghe for the Petitioner.

N. Kahawita, SC for the 1 st and 2nd Respondents.

Written Submissions of the Petitioners filed on: 19/06/2017 & 29/11/2017

Written Submissions of the Respondents filed on: 16/06/2017

Judgment on 24/07/2018

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

7

By this application the Petitioners' inter alia, are seeking, to charge the 1 st

and 2nd Respondents for committing an offence of contempt of court, for failing to

fully comply with the terms of settlement entered by the respective parties in case

No. (Writ) 750/2007. On 11109/2008, in terms of the said settlement, by joint

motion dated 28/08/2008, the Petitioners withdrew the said application.

8

The application for contempt of court was supported on 09/12/2010, and

the Court thereafter has directed the registrar to issue notice on the Respondents.

The Petitioner's by motion dated 05/01/2011 have moved to issue notice on the

Respondents and the said notice has been duly dispatched. The said motion states

that the Petition, affidavit and the documents marked A 1 to A 17 have been already

sent to the Respondents by registered post. The journal entry dated 29/12/2010,

confirms that only notice was filed on the said date.

Thereafter, several mention dates have been obtained on account of parties

moving for dates for settlement. When this matter was mentioned before Court on

08/1112106, respective parties moved to file written submissions to disposed of

this application. Thereafter on 14/11/2017, as per journal entry dated 08/11/2016,

the parties have reiterated their agreement to dispose of this application relying on

written submissions and therefore, the matter was fixed for Judgment.

In cases of contempt of court, simultaneously with the issue of notice, the

complainant should state the nature of the alleged offence, the grounds on which

the notice is issued and require the accused to appear on a day named therein to

answer the charge. Thereafter, the hearing is commenced by asking the accused

whether or not he adlnits the truth of the charge.

It is observed that in the instant case after the Court ordered the issue of

notice on the Respondents, the complainants have failed to describe the nature of

9

the offence or file charges against the accused in writing and stating precisely the

offence charged in support of their case. Therefore, by not filling a charge sheet to

answer, the complainant has failed to comply with the procedural requirelnents in

an application for contempt of court. There is also no prayer in the Petition to

punish the Respondents for contempt of court.

Therefore, the Court observes a failure, on the part of the Petitioner to

diligently prosecute this application.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed. The Petitioners are directed

to pay a sum of Rupees 25,0001- as costs to the Respondents.

P. Padman Surasena, J. (PICA)

I agree.
