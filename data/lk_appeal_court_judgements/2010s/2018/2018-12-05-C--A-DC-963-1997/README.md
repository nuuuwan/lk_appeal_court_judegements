M. M. A GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge of

Kurunagala in respect of a partition action bearing case No. 3264/P.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant") by his Plaint

dated 22.03.1989, instituted this action seeking to partition the land situated in

Kurunagala District among the parties and also for a Declaration of title to a

7/8 of an undivided portion of the specific land described in the schedule to

the plaint.

The Appellant's pedigree has set out that the specific land referred as

"Ikkiriwatta Pihiti Muhanthiramwatta" situated at Polgolla. Later found to be an

incorrect name and pleaded as "Muhanethirawatta" in Idiriwatta and situated

in Kurunegala District We-uda Village, Haenpaththuwa, Mathure Korale (vide

page 39 of the appeal brief).

3

The Appellant argued that Ranbanda and Bandaramenike were the original

owners of the land in suit (page 102 of the appeal brief). Ranbanda had

transferred his 1/2 share to Samarakoon Banda and he transferred to Ukku

Banda and also Ukku Banda is the son of the other original owner of

Bandaramenike who has inherited his mother's share that is 1/4 of undivided

share and transferred all his undivided 3/4 to Sirimal Bandaranayake and also

Nawarathna Banda who is also another heir of Bandara Menike transferred

his 1/8 undivided share to Sirimal Bandaranayake, and through this pedigree

the Appellant entitled to undivided 7/8 shares of the land.

The 1 st Respondent pleaded that land specified in the schedule to the Plaint

was belonged to Dingiri Banda and he is entitled to claim prescriptive title to

the land and he and his predecessors possessed the land for more than 10

years.

The 2nd Respondent claimed that he is entitled to undivided 1/4th share of the

land. He further stated that Punchi Kumarihami who had inherited undivided

1 14th share from her mother Bandara Menike the original owner and

transferred to the 2nd Respondent.

The Learned District Judge of Kurunagala who heard the evidence and in his

judgment delivered on 13.08.1997 urged the following grounds that, the

parties have failed to prove and identify the land in dispute. The pedigree

submitted by the Appellant has not been proved, and the 1st Respondent also

failed to prove the prescriptive title and the 2nd Respondent so on and so forth.

Finally he dismissed the case (vide page 102 to 120 of the appeal brief).

Being aggrieved with the judgment of the learned District Judge, this appeal

preferred by the Appellant to set aside the said judgment.

It is to be noted that the land in dispute had been referred in different names.

The appellant named the land as "Ikkiriwatta Pihiti Muhanthiramwatta"

situated at Polgolla while the 1st Respondent named the land as "Asgiriye

Gedarawatta" .

But after the Court Commission Survey Plan No. 528 dated 31.01.1991

(Survey initially had taken on 14.10.1990 and completed on 31.01.1991)

made by E. M. P. B Boyagoda and the report of the Surveyor, all the parties

had admitted the land and the admission also recorded in the case record and

I opinioned that the Learned District Judge misdirected himself and

erroneously stated that no party had taken steps to prove the land in dispute

and but it is clear the parties had identified the land in dispute.

In THILAGARATNAM VS. ATHPUNATHAN AND OTHERS [(1996) 2 SLR

66], Ananda Coomaraswamy, J. held that,

<t .it is the duty of the Court to investigate title in a partition

action, but the Court can do so only within the limits of

pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both

documentary and oral. Court cannot go on a voyage of

discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the corpus for

them; otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and expect

the Court to do their work and their Attorney-at-Law's work for

them to get title to those shares in the corpus." (page at 68)

The Appellant's claim of undivided 7/8 share is only relied upon his pedigree

and Deeds of transfer mentioned and marked as P1-P4. According to the

evidence led by the Appellant before the learned District Judge, and it is

clearly observed that only paper title been transferred to person to person not

the actual title of the land and Deed marked as P4 transferred in the year of

1909, and until 1976 there were no possession been established by the

owners and no steps been taken to establish them as owners and just had

mentioned in the pedigree. The learned District Judge has come to a strong

and clear view that the Appellant had failed to prove his title to the land in

dispute.

5

I accept the learned District Judge's decision in regard to the 2nd Respondent,

as he also failed to prove the actual title and had not taken any interest or

steps to prove his actual title and failed to establish his rights in regard to the

land in dispute.

The 1 st Respondent's position only depends on the prescriptive title.

According to him he claimed that he possess the entire land in dispute since

1940 from his father's time and entitled for prescriptive title. Even the

Appellant in his evidence stated that he and the people mentioned in the

pedigree did not have any possession to the land in dispute and agreed that

the 1st Respondent and his father had possessed for a longer period.

It is settled law that, in order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to

show a change in the nature of the possession and the party claiming

prescriptive right should show an ouster.

According to the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance Act, No

2 of 1889 the claimant must prove the following elements:-

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to independent or adverse to the claimant and

3. Then (10) years previous to the bringing of such action.

In D. R. KIRIAMMA vs. J. A. PODI BANDA AND OTHERS [2005 BLR at

page 09] in order to claim prescriptive title Udalagama, J. observed that,

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the

party claiming prescriptive possession. Importantly, prescription

is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable

circumspection is necessary to recognize the prescriptive title as

undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party having paper

title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made

legal due to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated

that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title is required to be by title

adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff. "

6

In DE SILVA vs. COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF INLAND REVENUE [80

NLR 292], Sharvananda, J. clearly and deeply observed that,

"The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear

and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile

to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the

property claimed. In order to constitute adverse

possession, the possession must be in denial of the title of

the true owner. The acts of the person in possession

should be irreconcilable with the rights of the true owner;

the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as

against the true owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial

of the title of the true owner there can be no adverse

possession. In deciding whether the alleged acts of the person

constitute adverse possession, regard must be had to the

animus of the person doing those acts, and this must be

ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each case and

the relationship of the parties. Possession which may be

presumed to be adverse in the case of a stranger may not

attract such a presumption, in the case of persons standing in

certain social or legal relationships. The presumption represents

the most likely inference that may be drawn in the context of the

relationship of the parties. The Court will always attribute

possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where the

possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be

assumed, in the absence of evidence, that the possession

is lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is held

by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son

was on behalf of and with the permission of the mother. Such

permissive possession is not in denial of the title of the mother

and is consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the

possession to acquire title by adverse possession. Where

possession commenced with permission, it will be presumed to

so continue until and unless something adverse occurred about

it. The onus is on the licensee to show when and how the

possession became adverse. Continued appropriation of the

income and payment of taxes will not be sufficient to convert

permissive possession into adverse possession, unless such

conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the perimeter's title. In

order to discharge such onus, there must be clear and

affirmative evidence of the change in the character of

possession. The evidence must point to the time of

commencement of adverse possession. Where the parties were

not at arm's length, strong evidence of a positive character is

necessary to establish the change of character. "

7

It is to be noted that the 1st Respondent's possession had been interrupted

only on 1976 by the Appellant but he and his father had been possessed and

resided in the land since 1940 and the evidence clearly led that the 1st

Respondent had born in the same land. So the adverse period will starts from

1940. It is crystal clear that the 1st Respondent's possession to the land in

dispute is more than 10 years.

I am of the view that the learned District Judge has failed to consider the

evidence led by him about the prescriptive title of the 1st Respondent.

In addition to above, in TILLEKARATNE vs. BASTIAN [(1918) 21 NLR 12],

Betram, C. J. referring to the real effect of the decision in COREA vs. ISERIS

APPUHAMY [(1911) 15 NLR 65] upon the interpretation of the word "adverse"

with reference to cases of co-ownership stated that the word must be

interpreted in the context of three principles of law:

Il

1. Every co-owner having a right to possess and enjoy the

whole property and every part of it, the possession of one co-

owner in that capacity is in law the possession of all.

2. Where the circumstances are such that a man's possession

may be referable either to an unlawful act or to a lawful title,

he is presumed to possess by virtue of the lawful title.

3. A person who has entered into possession of land in one

capacity is presumed to continue to possess it in the same

capacity.

8

I observed that the 1st Respondent's adverse title starts from 1940 which

already had established the prescriptive title to the 1 st Respondent and the

interruption caused by the Appellant in 1976 did not forfeit the 1 st

Respondent's right over land in dispute.

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the Appellant without cost

and I further hold that the 1 st Respondent is proved his prescriptive title and

entitled to the land in dispute.

Appeal dismissed.
