This Revision application is filed by the 1 st part Petitioners-Petitioners seeking to

set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara in Case No.

23/2011 dated 08.10.2013 and seeking to set aside the order of the Learned

Magistrate ofKalutara in MC Case No. 66906.

Facts of the case:

The 1 st part Petitioners-Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) had

made a complaint to the Police Station, Kalutara South in December 2009 stating

that,

a) The road that leads to the residence of the Petitioners was a 12 feet wide

road, namely Kuruduwatta Me~da Para,

b) House of the 2nd Part Respondents-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as

the 2nd Respondent) was situated at the end of the said road and the

owner of the land, na~ely Aruna Piyaratne (2nd Respondent) had filled

his land with soil that had been transported on several occasions in heavy

vehicles,

c) In the said process, the 2nd Respondent had covered the drain that was in

his land and thereby obstructed the flow of water into the drain.

d) As a result of aforesaid conduct, the houses of the Petitioners go under

,vater and the use of heavy vehicles had Gaused serious damages to the

said road.

e) This was brought to the notice of the 2nd Respondent, but he had failed to

take any action to prevent such damages being caused to the road and to

prevent the nuisance caused to the Petitioners.

Page 7 of 14

Consequent to the said complaints, a police 9fficer had inspected the said road in

issue on 28.12.2009 and had recorded the observations. According to the said

observations,

1) The lands were situated approximately half a feet lower elevation from

the said road,

2) The houses on the said road go under water even after a slight rain,

3) The land of the 2nd Respondent had been filled with soil,

4) The said road had been damaged due to the transportation of construction

materials in heavy vehicles to the land of 2nd Respondent,

5) Although the Petitioners had ~tated that there was a drain in the land of

the 2nd Respondent for the rain water to recede, there was no sign of such

a drain,

6) The level of the land of 2nd Respondent had been raised and therefore no

water stagnation in the sairlland.

Thereafter Party of the 2nd part-Respondents had made their statements to the

Police Station, Kalutara South in response to the complaints made by the

Petitioners. Accordingly the Complainant-l st Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the 1 st Respondent) had instituted action in the Magistrate's Court of

Kalutara under case l'-Jo. 66906 in terms of section 98 of the Criminal Procedure

Code Act No.15 of 1979. On 22.02.2010, the Learned Magistrate of Kalutara had

issued a Conditional order which included three conditions and subsequently the

2nd Respondent had filed objections in respect of the said Conditional order. On

03.06.2010, the Learned Magistrate had gone on a scene inspection with the Public

Health Inspector, Nagoda and had recorded his observations. The Learned

Magistrate had ordered the Public Health Inspector to tender a report with regard to

this issue and the PHI had tendered the same on 07.06.2010.

Page 8 of 14

The Learned Magistrate of Kalutara had deli~ered the order of the case No. 66906

on 04.11.2010, in which the Learned Magistrate had made the 1 st and 2nd

conditions of the Conditional Order absolute and vacated the 3rd condition without

making the said condition absolute.

Thereafter on or around 01.01.2011, the 2nd Respondent had obstructed the water

flow within Lot No.O 1 using a dozer and therefore the Petitioners had made a

complaint to the Police Station, Kalutara. Accordingly the 2nd Respondent was

charged in the Magistrate Court of Kalutara under Case No. 81443 for violation of

Court Order issued in MC Case No. 66906 dated 04.11.2010.

The Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that there had been an error with regard

to the condition No. 01 of the Conditional Order made by the Learned Magistrate

on 22.02.2010 and the same condition reproduced in the Order dated 04.11.2010,

; and the said error had made the entire order made on 04.11.2010 of no force or

value. Therefore the Petitioners had made an application to the Learned Magistrate

of Kalutara seeking to correct the said error, to which the 2nd Respondent had

objected. The Learned Magistrate had delivered the order in respect of said

application on 24.03.2011, rejecting to rectify the said error since there was no

direct provision to rectify such errors in an event of both parties did not agree to do

so.

Being aggrieved by the Orders of the Learned Magistrate dated 04.11.2010 and

24.03.2011, the P(titioners had filed a revision application in the High Court of

Kalutara under Case NO.HCRA 23/2011 seeking to revise and set aside the

aforesaid orders. The Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara had pronounced the

Judgment of the said case on 08.10.2013 stating that,

1. This matter was a civil dispute between parties,

Page 9 of 14

11. The Learned Magistrate had fai1~d to correctly ascertain whether the

alleged nuisance was a public or a private one,

111. The Magistrate had no power to interfere with a private nuisance.

Accordingly the Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara had set aside all the orders

made by the Learned Magistrate of Kalutara in the aforesaid case.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioners have preferred a reVISIon

application in this court seeking to set aside the said Order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Kalutara. Further they seek to rectify the error in 1 st condition of the

Order made on 04.11.2010 by the Learned !v1agistrate of Kalutara.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the said order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 08.10.~013 was contrary to law and to the judicial

p:-ecedence in matters related to public n~isal1ce and therefore has amounted to

constitute exceptional circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

court.

In the case of Saram v. Seneviratna (1918) 21 NLR 190, it was held that,

"Here, again, it is noticeable that the act may be a ''public nuisance,"

though it only ajjcects people dwelling in the vicinity. All that is essential is

that the injury, danger, or annoyance should be comlnon ", and not special to

afew individuals. In an Indian case referred to in Ratanlal's Law ofCrilnes

487, it was held that the expression ''people in general" in the corresponding

section of the Indian Penal Code meant a body or considerable number of

persons, and, as the learned authors put it at page 486, it is in the quantuln

of annoyance that public nuisance differs from private ... "

Page 1.0 of 14

In the case of Sinna Gura v. IP of Police, l(arawanella (1957) 61 NLR 186, it

was held that,

"The evidence in this case shows that the damage which was likely to be

caused by the jack tree in question would be confined to the complainant

and the members of his family ... the Learned Magistrate has not appreciated

the.fact that Cap. 9 relates only to public nuisances ... "

In the above mentioned case of Sinna Gura, Justice Sinnetamby had referred to

the Judgment of K.S.P. Fernando v. C.D. Fernando and another (1936) 1 CLJ

29.

In the said Judgment of Fernando v. Fern~ndo, Soertsz,J had held that,

"But, as pointed out by De Sampayo J, in De Silva v. De Silva 1 C.W.R.

98, those provisions are aimed against public nuisance ... DE SAMP A YO, J,

continues as fo:lows- "Counsel for the complainant, howt!ver, emphasized

the words (injury to persons living in the neighbourhood' and argued that as

the complainant and his family are persons living in the neighbourhood of

the land on which the offending tree stands, the requirements of the section

were satisfied. But the word (neighbourhood' in the context does not irnply

'nearness' but locality and it seems to me that the section provides for a

case in which the part of the public living in the place where the nuisance

exists are generally affected, and that a single man and his family who

complain against the next door neighbour are not within the contemplation

of the section." I would respectfully follow that ruling and say that the

Petitioner cannot claim relief under this chapter ... "

Page 11 of 14

In the case of Somapala Fernando v. S.C. Fernando (2002) 3 Sri.LR 388, it was

stated that,

"The above items of evidence may have been useful if there was initially

evidence to show that the smoke emitted or likely to be emitted was causing

a nuisance to the residents in the vicinity. The evidence led at the

Magistrate's Court at best goes to prove a private nuisance as opposed to a

public nuisance the only witnesses being the husband and wife ... "

The Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara had referred to the following

Judgments in the order dated 08.10.2013;

1) Fernando v. Fernando (1936) 01 CLJ 29

2) Don Andris v. Manuel (1909)~2I:eader LR 143

3) SinDa Gura v. IP of Police, Karawanella (1957) 61 NLR 186

4) Ratwatte v. Owen (1892) 01 S.C.R. 172

5) S~ram v. Seneviratna (1918) 21 NLR 190

6) Sandrasegra v. Sinnatamby (1923) 25 NLR 139

7) Hendricks Mendis v. Chandrasekera Mudaliyar (1908) 12 NLR 33

Upon examination of the sketch of road in issue (Page 107 of the brief) and the

evidence produced, we find that the said road too does not seelll to be a public road

but rather a private right of way for the owners of certain lands and houses. Further

we find that this issue does not fall within the ambit of public nuisance.

In light of above Judgments and the facts of the instant case we are of the view that

the Petitioners should resort to a civil action which provides an appropriate

remedy.

Page 12 of 14

In the case of Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 Sri. LR 225, it was held,

"The powers by way of revision conferred on the Appellate Court are very

wide and can be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against an

order of the original Court or not. However, such powers would be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances where an appeal lay and as to

what such exceptional cirrun1stances are, is dependent on the facts of each

case ...

Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case there were no

such exceptional circumstances disclosed as would cause the Appellate

Court to exercise its discretion and grant relief by way of revision ... "

Accordingly we are of the view that th~ order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Kalutara in the Case No. HeRA 23/2011 is correct in law and we see no reason to

interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge. Therefore we affirm

the order dated 08.10.2013.

Revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
