ACHALA WENGAPPULI T.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Colombo under Section 54A(b) and (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended, for illegal trafficking and

possession of 4.29 grams of heroin on or about 10.05.2007. After trial, he

was found guilty of both counts and was imposed an imprisonment for life

in respect of each of them.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Accused-

Appellant invoked appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set them

aside. In support of his appeal, the Accused-Appellant contended that the

trial Court had not properly considered the infirmities of the prosecution's

case and, in addition, it failed to properly consider his statement made

from the dock.

2

In relation to the complaint that the trial Court had not properly

considered the infirmities of the prosecution's case, the Accused-Appellant

submitted that there is inconsistency between PW2 51 Kariyawasam's

evidence as to where and when the notes of investigations were made,

when compared with the evidence of PWI IP Ranasinghe. It is submitted

the notes of investigations were pasted in the Information Book only after

a lapse of 11 days from the date of detection. In addition, PW4 PC 49631

Kamal, although participated in the detection, has not made any notes of

investigation at all.

The evidence before the trial Court revealed that the detection was

made by a Police party led by PWI IP Ranasinghe and soon after returning

to Kotahena Police, where he was attached to at the time, made his notes of

investigation. The evidence of PW2 51 Kariyawasam also revealed that he

too made his notes on the same day at 5.40 p.m. and handed them over to

PC 61072 Bandara to be pasted in the Information Book. He had done so

only on 21.05.2007, after 11 days delay. When confronted with the

suggestion during the cross examination that the notes were in fact made

belatedly, the witness stated he made notes on the same day but in pasting

a delay had occurred which could be attributed to other more pressing

official obligations.

It seems that the Accused-Appellant's contention is that the pasting

of notes belatedly would make an adverse impact on the credibility of the

evidence of the said witness. There was clear uncontradicted evidence

before the trial Court that the two officers who conducted the detection

had made notes soon after their return to the Police station. Admittedly

there was a gap of 11 days in pasting them in the Information Book. This

fact could not be stretched into justifying an inference that the notes were

made belatedly and therefore his evidence could not be relied upon.

In fact, the trial Court had devoted significant space in its judgment

to deal with this aspect of the prosecution evidence. Thereafter, it had

rightly decided to accept the prosecution evidence as a truthful and

reliable version of events in relation to the detection made.

The fact that PW4 had not made any notes was also considered by

the trial Court. It noted that the said witness was called by the prosecution

as a witness to the "chain of productions" and only upon cross

examination he gave evidence about the detection. In the absence of any

notes to refresh his memory, the witness nonetheless gave consistent

evidence with the other officers who had benefit of perusing their notes.

The mere absence of notes would not make his evidence unreliable or

false.

It was contended by the Accused-Appellant that, judging by the

ordinary conduct, it is improbable for the Police not to conduct a search of

his house as they claim he was arrested near his house with a parcel

weighing 30 grams of heroin. PWl, when confronted with this suggestion,

4

provided an explanation as to why they did not conduct a search of his

house. According to him they made a successful detection upon an

information received from a private informant. As such there was no

necessity to further conduct a search and he had used his discretion as the

team leader not to carry out a search although he had the necessary man

power to carry out such a search.

This submission had already been considered by the trial Court

when it undertook to evaluate the credibility of prosecution evidence by

applying the test of probability and improbability on them. It had rightly

arrived at the conclusion, that it was not improbable for the Accused-

Appellant not to possess any personal items such as a NIC, purse or some

cash since the detection was made near his house.

In view of these considerations, it is our considered view that the

said ground of appeal is devoid of any merit.

The second ground of appeal related to the contents of the dock

statement made by the Accused-Appellant. It is contended that the trial

Court failed to properly evaluate his statement from the dock, in relation

to his narration of the sequence of events which led to his arrest.

It is stated in the judgment that the basis on which it rejected the

dock statement of the Accused-Appellant, is on the following grounds;

5

\ I

1. the claims by the Accused-Appellant that there was a scuffle

with some others at the time of his arrest, his reason for going

out of the house, possession of his NIC and phone at the time

of arrest had not been suggested to any of the prosecution

witnesses and had raised for the first time only in his

statement as an afterthought,

11. there was no definitive and specific denial of possession of the

packet of heroin detected, coupled with his belated claim that

it was detected from another person and "introduced" to him,

iii. inconsistency of the basis on which he cross examined the

prosecution witnesses in relation to the sequence of events

leading up to his arrest and the position he had advanced in

his statement from the dock.

Having considered these infirmities in the dock statement, the trial

Court had correctly rejected it as a false one. Before it ventured to analyse

the statement, the trial Court reminded itself as to the applicable legal

principles in relation to evaluation of dock statements and the three

positions it must consider. We see no misapplication of any legal

principles or an illegal imposition of an evidentiary burden on the

Accused- Appellant with regard to contents of his dock statement.

6

, .

In view of the above considerations, it is our firm view that the

appeal of the Accused-Appellant has no merits and therefore ought to be

dismissed.

Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence of life

imprisonment imposed on the Accused-Appellant.

The appeal of the Accused-Appellant is therefore stands dismissed.
