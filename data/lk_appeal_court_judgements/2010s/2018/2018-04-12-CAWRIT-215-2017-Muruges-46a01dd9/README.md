P.Padman Surasena, J (PLCA)

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for all the

parties. This inquiry was held to ascertain whether the Court is going to

accept the amended petition that has been filed by the petitioner without

obtaining prior permission of the Court. There is nothing recorded in the

docket that this Court has granted permission for the petitioner to file an

amended petition. Therefore this Court is of the opinion that the petitioner

has filed the amended petition without permission of Court.

The next question to be considered by this Court is whether the

petition that has already been filed by the petitioner should be accepted or

not.

It is the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the 4th

Respondent that the amended petition has entirely changed the scope of

the original application.

This Court observes that the interest of the petitioner in the original

application was to have the ongoing customs inquiry suspended and halted

on the basis that the inquirer is bias.

In the amended petition what the petitioner prays for is to quash the

determination made by the said inquiring officer at the end of the said

inquiry.

This Court observes that the decision dated 14.07.2017 which is

impugned in the amended petition was non existent at the time of filing

this application. Therefore it is the view of this Court that the petitioner

through the amended petition has entirely changed the scope of the

previous application. This Court is of the view that amendments of this

nature which entirely change the nature, character and the scope of an

application should not be permitted. Therefore this Court decides to refuse

to accept the amended petition.

"

4

Learned Counsel for the petitioner states that the original application

cannot be proceeded with, without amending the said application.

Therefore we decide to dismiss this application without costs.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

A.L.Shiran Gooneratne. J

I agree.
