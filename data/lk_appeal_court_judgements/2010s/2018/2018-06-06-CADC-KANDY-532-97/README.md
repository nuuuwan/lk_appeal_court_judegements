This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District

Judge of Kandy in respect of a partition action Number P13140.

2

3

The Plaintiffs Appellants [ hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants ] instituted this action seeking to partition the land called

"Wetakedeniye" also known as Walawwapitiyahena" depicted in Plan

Number 6139 dated 19. 10. 1993 made by G. R. W. N. Weerakoon

Licensed Surveyor marked as "X" and produced and file of record.

It is noted that there was no contest regarding the corpus and the

original owners. But the contest was regarding the devolution of title

and how the building standing in the particular "Wetakadeniye" also

known as Walawwapitiyahena should be allocated to the parties.

The Appellants claimed that particular house marked as "G" in

plan Number 6139 as their original ancestral home or "Mulgedara"

and where they had been in occupation right through out.

The Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd Defendants - Respondents

hereinafter referred to as the 1 st and 2nd Respondents] claimed 2/3 of

the Mulgedara house as they get their shares of the land and the

balance 113 only should go to the 3rd and 4 th Defendants-

Respondents [hereinafter referred to as the 3 rd and 4 th Respondents]

3

4

and they mentioned that the 3rd and 4th Respondents are out siders

and they were the contesting parties in Lot 2 in Plan No. 6139 dated

19. 10. 1993 marked as "X" and that they have possessed the said

house "G" and consequently they have acquired a prescriptive title.

Before coming to the pleadings the real owners of this house

were Punchi Banda, Wijesuriya and Tikiri Menike.

The Appellants and the 15t and 2nd Respondents got their 2/3

shares of the said "Mulgedara" house there on from their predecessors

in title for the land and house from Pun chi Banda and Wijesuriya and

on the other hand Tikiri Menike's 1/3 share transferred to 3rd and 4th

Respondents.

The 3rd and 4th Respondents claimed that they are entitled to

Lot 2 in Plan 6139 marked as "X" and the prescriptive right and also

claimed the building marked as "H", "G" and "J" standing in the said

Lot 2 in Plan No.6139 and mentioned that the Appellants'

predecessors had left their portion of the house and never came to the

house after 1964 and thereby that favored clear prescriptive title and

4

J 1 ,

5

the 3rd Respondent pleaded that in addition to the title, he constructed

a building, renovated the old house, made improvement and added

extensions without any interruption or objections from the Appellants

and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents.

The Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents had filed an

action against the 3rd and 4th Respondents with regard to the same

house and land, later the Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents

withdrew the said action, and it was dismissed and further there was

no denial of the possession of the 3rd and 4th Respondents.

Later the Appellants had filed this partition action in respect of

the same land along with the building in the District Court ofKandy.

The learned District Judge of Kandy who heard the evidence

and held that the house marled as "G" should go entirely to the 3rd

and 4th Respondents and 2/3 share claimed by the Appellants and the

1 st and 2nd Respondents were not allotted to them.

The learned District Judge took up a position that the 3rd and 4th

Respondents were undisturbed and uninterrupted the possession for a

5

6

certain long period and the particular house was old and repairs,

improvements were done by them.

The Appellants move the Judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 2nd February 1997 be set aside and the Judgment to be entered

as prayed for in the Plaint.

Following grounds have been urged on behalf of the Appellants

to set aside the Judgment of the learned District Judge.

It is submitted that the said Judgment is contrary to law and the

weight of evidence led at the trial and had failed to consider co-

owners do not lose their rights without an ouster and also he had

misdirected himself in deciding the purported improvements done by

the 3 rd and 4th Respondents as a criterion to decide the title. It is

also stated that the learned District Judge had considered irrelevant

facts and law in deciding the case and had non-considered and

disregarded relevant vital evidence/ facts and law has failed to adduce

reasons.

Prescription

The facts that germane to the issue are whether the 3rd and 4th

Respondents had prescribed the house in contention "0" is standing

on co-owned land in terms of Sections 3 of Prescription Ordinance.

The issue No. 17 raised before the learned District Judge read as:-

"In the event of this Court accepting the separate distinct

possession among the said parties, there has been a common

possession by the parties?"

Answer given to that has no separate and distinct possession

proved. The land had been commonly possessed. It is a clear fact that

the land including the building co-owned land and had been

commonly possessed.

According to the prOVISIons of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance Act No.2 of 1889 the claimant must prove,

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant

plaintiff and

3. Ten years previous to the bringing of such action.

In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a

change in the nature of the possession and the party claiming

prescriptive right should show an ouster.

In D.R. Kiriamma V. J.A. Podibanda and 8 Others 2005

B.L.J. 9 in order to claim prescriptive title Udalagama J. Averted

that,

"onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party

claiming prescriptive possession. Importantly, prescription is a

question of fact. Physical possession is a factum probandum. I am

inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the

ownership of the party having paper title. It is in fact said that title

by prescription is an illegality made legal due to the other party not

taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a

claimant or Plaintiff."

In De Silva V. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue 80

NLR 292 Sharvananda 1. clearly and deeply observed that,

8

9

"The principle of law is well established that a person who bases his

title adverse possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence

that his possession was hostile to the real owner and amounted to a

denial of his title to the property claimed. In order to constitute

adverse possession, the possession must be in denial of the title of the

true owner. The acts of the person in possession should be

irreconcilable with the rights of the true owner; the person in

possession must claim to be so as of right as against the true owner.

Where there is no hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner

there can be no adverse possession. In deciding whether the alleged

acts of the person constitute adverse possession, regard must be had

to the animus of the person doing those acts, and this must be

ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each case and the

relationship of the parties. Possession which may be presumed to be

adverse in the case of a stranger may not attract such a presumption,

in the case of persons standing in certain social or legal

relationships. The presumptions represent the most likely inference

that may be drawn in the context of the relationship of the parties.

The Court will always attribute possession to a lawful title where that

is possible. Where the possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it

must be assumed, in the absence of evidence, that the possession is

lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is held by the

son, the presumptions will be that the enjoyment of the son was on

9

I iiI , t I

Ii ! I 1I!f ,

JI

i. !I

10

behalf of and with the presumption of the mother. Such permissive

possession is not in denial of the title of the mother and is

consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the possession to

acquire title by adverse possession. Where possession commenced

with permission, it will be presumed to so continue until and unless

something adverse occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to

show when and how the possession became adverse. Continued

appropriation of the income and payment of taxes will not be

sufficient to convert permissive possession into adverse possession,

unless such conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the perimeter's

title. In order to discharge such onus, there must be clear and

affirmative evidence of the change in the character of possession.

The evidence must point to the time of commencement of adverse

possession. Where the parties were not at arm's length, strong

evidence of a positive character is necessary to establish the change

of character. JJ

evidence states that:- (at page No.122 of the Appeal brief)

c:. we).

It is evident that the Mulgedara has been split into 3 parts and the 3rd

Respondent according to his deed owned 1/3 of the house.

The 3rd Respondent's evidence significant, in order to consider their

state of mind and the nature of their possession.

In Sirajudeen and Two Others v. Abbas - SLR - 365, Vol 2 of 1994

the Supreme Court has observed thus:

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general

statements of witness that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute

for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are not

12

I c , t

~ 1II I I I f

f I

\

III

13

evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to

support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses

should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be

decided thereupon by Court.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant

or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such character

as is incompatible with the title of the owner.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas - 59 NLR - 546 at 548

......... Apart from the use of the word possess, the witness called by

the plaintiff did not describe the manner of possession.

In Alwis V. Perera (1919) 21 NLR at page 326 Bertram C.J stated

that,

" I wish very much that District Judges I speak not

particularly, but' I possessed' or we possessed

or we took the procedure, would not confine themselves

13

It I I

J f Il I If ,

~ t tt tII

~ !

14

merely to recording the words, but would insist on those

words being explained and exemplified. "

In Corea v. Appuhamy Et AI. (1911)15 NLR 65 the privy Council

decision laid down for the first time in clear and authoritative

terms the following principles:

1. The possession of one co-owner, was in law, the possession of

others,

2. Every co-owner must be presumed to be possessing in that

capacity,

3. It was not possible for such a co-owner to put an end to that

title and to initiate a prescriptive title by any secret intention

in his own mind and

4. That nothing short of an ouster, could bring about that result.

In Tillekeratne v. Bastian [1918] 21 NLR 12 Bertram C.J referring

to the real effect of the decision in Corea v. Iseris Appuhamy upon

the interpretation of the word "adverse" with reference to cases of co-

ownership stated that the word must be interpreted in the context of

three principle of law:

14

15

(i.) Every co-owner having a right to possess and enjoy the

whole property and every part of it, the possession of one co-

owner in that capacity is in law the possession of all.

(ii) Where the circumstances are such that a man's possession

may be referable either to an unlawful act or to a lawful title,

he is presumed to possess by virtue of the lawful title.

(iii) A person who has entered into possession of land in one

capacity is presumed to continue to possess it in the same

capacity.

In Leisa and Another v. Simon and Another - SLR - 148, Vol 1 of

2002 Justice Wigneswaran had clearly stated that long period

possession alone court not establish any prescriptive title to the land.

"Possession and occupation must be distinguished. The long

period of occupation would not make it an adverse

possession unless there had been an overt act of ouster as in

the case of prescription among co-owners. The learned

Judge also seems to have overlooked the difference between

long occupation as a licensee and adverse possession. "

Wickremaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera - SLR - 190, Vol

1 of 1986 held that,

15

f I1

t 1 I t I

f , i I ,\ r'

16

" in a partition action for a lot of land claimed by the

plaintiff to be a divided portion of a larger land, he must

adduce proof that the co-owner who originated the division

and such co-owner's successor had prescribed to that

divided portion by adverse possession for at least ten years

from the date of ouster or something equivalent to ouster.

Where such co-owner had himself executed deeds for

undivided shares of the larger land after the year of the

alleged dividing off it will militate against the plea of

prescription. Possession of divided portions by different co-

owners is in no way inconsistent with common possession.

A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of the co-

owners every co-owner is presumed to be in possession in his

capacity as co-owner. A co-owner cannot put an end to his

possession as co-owner by a secret intention in his mind

Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster

could bring about that result".

Even though the Appellants predecessors in 1964 left their portion

leaving behind their paraphernalia and furniture at their portion of the

said house marked as 'G' would not amount to long possession and

which does not show an ouster and in my view leaving behind their

16

f t i

~ I II

~ ,t! Ii l

17

furniture and paraphernalia could be Animus Revertenti that means

intention to return and the Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents

would not forfeit their possessing right over the said "Mulgedara".

In Kanapathipillai v. Meerasaibo - NLR - 41 of 58 [1956] Sansoni

J with H.N.G. Fernando J. concurring has held as follows,

"The rule is well settled that when a co-owner convey the

entire land held in common to a stranger, and the latter

enters into possession of the entire land under the

conveyance, he can, by possession adverse to all the co-

owners for ten years, acquire a prescriptive title, But where

such a stranger is aware, at the time he obtains the

conveyance, that his vendor was only a co-owner and was

not a sole owner of the land, ten years possession by him

will not give him a prescriptive title. Such a purchaser cannot

be said to have entered into possession as a sole owner, for

the knowledge that there were others who owned shares in

the land, and he will be presumed to have possessed the land

as a co-owner. The ordinary rule which applies to possession

by co-owners will then apply, viz., that before one can

prescribe against the others there must be an ouster or

something equivalent to an ouster. Hence prescriptive

17

18

possessIon will begin to run In his favour against those

others only if there has been an ouster or its equivalent, such

as notice to those other co-owners that he was setting up a

title adverse to them"

It is to be noted that the 3 rd and 4th Respondents were in possession

for a long period does not qualify them to claim absolute ownership

and the 3 rd and 4th Respondents had failed to prove an overt act of

ouster.

The Learned District Judge had failed to consider that the 3rd and 4th

Respondents' were in possession of the said house and the co-owners

did not lose their rights.

Improvements

Considering the fact that pleaded by the 3 rd and 4th Respondents that

they had renovated the old "Mulgedara" house marked as 'G' made

improvements and added extensions cannot be sufficient to establish

prescriptive title against the other co-owner.

19

In view of Maria Fernando and Another v. Anthony Fernando -

SLR - 356, Vol 2 of 1997 Court of Appeal held that,

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of

produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a

party, preparing plan and building house on land and renting

it are not enough to establish prescription among co-owners

in the absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to

prescribe may not amount to ouster. "

Also in Dias Abysinghe V.Dias Abeysinghe and Two others 34

CL W 69 (SC) observed that,

H that, where a co-owner erects a new building on the

common land and remains on possession thereof for over ten

years, he does not acquit prescriptive right to the building

and the soil on which it stands as against the other co-

owners merely by such possession"

It is clear that these general principles analyzed that the

improvements, renovations made in common land or a building

cannot be established prescriptive title against other co-owners.

20

The Learned District Judge was misdirected himself in deciding

the improvements done by the 3 rd and 4th Respondents in order to

decide the title.

III

Res Judicata

The Counsel for the 3rd and 4th Respondents took up a position in his

written submission that,

Plaintiffs (the appellants) also admitted that D.C. Kandy case

NO.173341L was filed in respect of the House "G" which was later

withdrawn reserving no right to file a fresh case. The said action was

dismissed accordingly. It is respectfully submitted once a case is

withdrawn without reserving rights to file a fresh case it becomes

"Res Judicata".

The Complainants' (the Appellants) instituted an action against the 3rd

and 4th Defendants (the Respondents) in the District Court of Kandy

case number bearing 173341L on 13th January 1993, seeking an

injunction or stay order for restricting the undergoing constructions of

20

21

the questioned building also known as "Mulgedara" Pg.217 of the

appeal brief marked as 3 v 1.

Answering the cross examination that the 3rd respondent testified as;

In the meantime the complainants (the Appellants) had

instituted a partition action against the Respondents to divide the

questioned land and the building, in the same District Court under

case no. P 13140 on 8th of June 1993.

Therefore, complainants withdrew the aforementioned land

dispute action! 17331L on 6th of October1993 at Pg.235 after filing

the partition actionIP 13140.

The 2nd complainant testified that he withdrew the land dispute

action that was filed, because he wished to partition the house and

the land.

At Pg. 24 of the Appeal brief that the 2nd complainant testified as;

At Pg. 89 of the Appeal brief that the 2nd complainant testified as;

In Rev. Moragolle Sumangala v. Rev. Kiribamune Piyadssi

- NLR - 322 of 56 (1955)

Two important tests must be applied whenever plea of res

judicata is raised:

(1) Whether the judicial decision in the earlier litigation was, or at

least involved, a determination of the same question as that

22

4

I ! I I I If

\

I i

23

sought to be controverted in the later litigation in which the

estoppel is raise, and, if so,

(2) Whether the parties to the later litigation are the parties or the

parties of the parties to the earlier decision.

I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned

District Judge regarding the plea of res judicata and it had no

application in the original action.

Considering all the evidence I am of the VIew that, the

aforementioned land dispute and partition actions were based on

different issues and grounds but they were among the same parties.

Accordingly, I hold that the plea of res judicata is failed.

In my opinion, it is to be discussed in view of Section 406 of

Civil Procedure Code.

Section 406 (1) - if, at any time after the institution of the

action, the court is satisfied on the application of the Plaintiff-

(a) That the action must ail by reason of some formal defect, of

23

4

f f ,

\ !

24

(b) That there are sufficient grounds for permitting him to withdraw

from the action of to abandon part of his claim with liberty to

bring a fresh action for the subject matter of the action, of in

respect of the part so abandoned,

The court may grant such permission on such terms as to costs

of otherwise as think fit.

(2) If the Plaintiff withdraw from the action, of abandon part of his

claim, without such permission, he shall be liable for such costs the

court may award, and shall be precluded from bringing a fresh action

for the same matter or in respect of the same part.

In Fernando v. Fernando - NLR - 99 of 3 held that,

lithe District Court is empowered to dismiss or allow the

withdrawal of an action with liberty to re-institute the case on

the same cause. Even if a lower court has not given reasons to

justify the grant of such permission if it appears to the Supreme

Court that there were good reasons, plea of res judicata does

not debar such re-institution."

And also in Jayawardene V. Arnolishamy 69 NLR 497 held

that, the term "subject matter" in section 406 of the CPC does not

24

25

mean the property in respect of which an action is brought. It

includes the fact and circumstances upon which the Plaintiff s right to

the relief claimed by him depends.

The dismissal of an action upon its withdrawal by the plaintiff

gives rise to the statutory bar provided for in section 406 (2) of the

Civil Procedure Code. It does not, however, provide the basis for a

plea of res judicata properly so termed, because there is no

adjudication.

I am of the view that plea of res judicata shall not succeed and

the Appellants have all their rights to maintain a fresh action.

The counsel for the Appellants submitted In their written

submission, which the issue No. 20 read as follows,

Are the 3 rd and 4th Defendants entitled to all the buildings on

Lot2?

25

26

The answer to the said issue No. 20 is that the 3rd Deferent is

entitled to building marked "G" and the 4th Defendant is entitled to

buildings marked "H" and "J".

And further the learned counsel states in the written submission

as;

Contrary to the said position the Learned District Judge has

granted the house,(the building) marked "G" to 3rd and 4th

Respondents. Learned District Judge's purported rationale is that

since the plaintiffs and their predecessors had abandoned the

building, it has to be accepted that the said building marked "G" had

been renovated by the 3rd and 4th defendants and hence the building

should be granted to the 3 rd defendant Respondent. This is an

erroneous finding of fact as the same is against the weight of

evidence. This should not have been the criterion in developing right.

This is a clear misdirection. Irrelevant facts which are not been borne

out by evidence had been considered the relevant facts/ evidence

which has direct bearing had been disregarded. There is no proper

26

,

~ I !

i.

t t t

\

t r

27

consideration and evaluation of evidence adduced in the District

Court. Hence there are questions of law.

It is to be noted that there is a merit in the aforementioned

submissions of the counsel for the Appellants that the Learned

District Judge's approach to this case has not been sound according

to the decided cases.

In Dona Lucihamy V. Cicilyahamy 59 NLR 214 at 216

mentioned that bare answers to the issues or points of contest

whatever may be the name given to them are insufficient unless all

matters which arise for decision under each head are examined.

In Warnakula V. Ramani Jayawardena (1990) 1 Sri LR

206 stated that evidence germane to each issue must be reviewed

or examined.

In Sopinona V. Pitipanaarachchi (2010) 1 Sri LR 88

observed that answering only points of contest raised by one party

in a partition action an failing to consider the points of contest

raised by other parties amounts to denial of justice to the latter

27

i I

f I

I l t I ,

1

28

parties for fault of theirs. Failure to consider the deeds and other

documents produced by the respondents at the trial leads to the

conclusion considering the rights of the respondents, there had in

fact been a miscarriage of justice.

And also Justice Janak De Silva in Muththananda

Namperumage Dhanayaka V. Nanayakaravasam and Others

CA 1340/99F observed the context of perfunctory judgments

compliance with Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code and held

that the Learned District judge has not referred to his evidence in

the judgment.

I am of view that, the Learned District Judge has misdirected

himself and given bare answers to some of the issues without

evaluating the evidence and failed to adduce reasons.

I am of the firm view, that the Learned District Judge who

heard the evidence has allotted the Mulgedara house to the 3rd and

4 th respondents only by bearing the fact that they renovated and

added extensions to the house and were in possession for a long

28

.~

f 1

\

t 1 ,

29

period of time, even though the 3rd and 4th respondents had not

proved the ouster of the other co-owners, mere possession for a

longer period would not amount to absolute ownership.

The appellants and the 1 st and 2nd respondents non occupation

of the house does not forfeit their right to Mulgedara.

F or the foregoing reasons, I allow the appeal with costs and

set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kandy dated

2nd February 1997. I further hold that the appellants and the 1 st and

2nd respondents are entitled to their 2/3 shares of the house marked

"G" and known as Mulgedara or ancestral house. 3rd and 4th

respondents only entitled to 1/3 share of the hose marked "G".
