..:.. '. ' . . ~ >~~:' ::~." .'

seeking to set aside the order of the Learn~'d Magistrate of Attanagalle in Case No.

10610166 dated 21.07.2006.

Facts of the Case:

The OIC, Weeragula had filed the infol1ration under section 66 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 fe llowing a cOlnplaint made to the Police

Station, Weeragula by the 1 st Par y Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1 st Party Respondent). The said information under

section 66 (1 )(a) was filed regarding a dispute related to a land between the 1 st

party Respondent and the 2nd party R(~ spondent that was arisen on or about

13.02.2006.

On 22.04.2006, a site inspection was heLl by the SSP, Gampaha with few other

police officers of Weeragula police. In,~he said inspection report, the SSP had

noted that there had existed a wire fence which later had been removed leaving

behind the holes from which the several 1-~~nce posts had been removed. The SSP

had ordered to reconstruct the fence. Theri~after the 1 st Party Respondent had made

a complaint to the Police Head Quarters lbainst the SSP for being bias to the other

party.

The OIC had attempted to withdraw the case on 28.04.2006 when the case was

called for notice and the Learned Magistrate of Attanagalle had refused the

application for withdrawal. After considering the affidavits, counter affidavits and

written submissions filed by the parties, the Learned Magistrate delivered the order

on 21.07.2006. In the said order the Learned Magistrate had ordered to remove the

fence that was put up on order of the SSP, Ion 22.04.2006.

I;

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned Magistrate, the Appellants had filed a

revision application in the High Court of (lampaha. On 16.08.2007, the Learned

High Court Judge of Gampaha had dismissed the revision application.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the. Appellants have filed an appeal in this

court seeking to set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate of Attanagalle and

the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

The Learned President's Counsel for ,the Respondents submitted that the

Appellants have not filed a full copy of tf ~~ Magistrate Court Proceedings in this

court. He further submitted that even though the Appellants had promised to file a

certified copy of the entire case record, th~y had failed to do so, and therefore the

application has to be dismissed in limine.

Upon perusal of the certified case record suomitted, we find that the proceedings of

the Magistrate court and/or the journal entries have not been attached.

Rule 3(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 requires the

Petitioner to tender all the documents material to an application and in an event a

;. Petitioner fails to comply with such provisions, the Court may ex mero motu or at

the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

~

In the case of Dahanayake and others v Sti Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd.

and others (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 67, it was held that,

"If there is no full and truthful disclO,sure of material facts, the Court would

not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination ... "

In the case of Lokugalappaththige Cyril & Others v Attorney General [S.C

(Spl.) L.A. No. 272/2013] it was held that,

Page 5 of 10

"In a brief manner a fair and full disclosure of all material facts would be

essential and should be pleaded in applications to Superior Courts by

parties aggrieved of orders and judgments of the lower courts. In the same

manner a "plain and concise stater/Lents of all facts and material" would be

mandatory for special leave to. Appeal Applications to the Supreme

C " ourt ...

Since this is an appeal against the order of the revision application No. 34/2006

(Rev), we are inclined to consider whether this objection was raised by the

Respondents at the stage of High Court. A ~ccordingly we find that this objection

was raised by the Respondents in their sLatement of objections filed in the High

Court (At page 39 and 40 of the brief). The Respondents had further averred in

said objections that the certified copies of the Petition and the Affidavit did not

have a valid seal of a commissioner for oaths. We find that some of the material

documents certified as "true copy" only have the phrase "Attorney at Law" in the

seal and a signature. However a name of the Attorney at Law who certified the

copies was not mentioned in said seal.

In the case of Nadugala Vidhana Pathiranage Piyadasa v Attorney General

rCA (PHC) APN 65/2017], it was held that,

"This Court in the case of the Attorney General vs Ranjith Weerawickrama

Charles rCA (PHC) APN 7412016 decided on 2017-10-09J considered the

same question that arose in that ,case. Having considered the relevant

aspects pertaining to this issue, this Court underlined the importance of

tendering to Court, authentic copies of impugned documents, which must

bear an authoritative and responsible signature. This is not only just to

certify such copies but also to take ~the responsibility for the authenticity of

Page 6 of 10

such documents. In that case' :his Court held that a photocopy of

proceedings certified by an Attol1''1ey-At-Law as a 'true copy' cannot be

considered as a certified copy within the meaning of rule 03 (1) (a) of the

.', Court of Appeal (Appellate procedure) Rules 1990. "

l It is pertinent to note that the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha has stated in

the order that the Appellants had not ~;ubmitted the entire case record of the

Magistrate Court case, to the High Court, as promised by the paragraph 19 of the

" revision application.

35 of the brief/ page 11 of the High, Court order)

II> It is an established principle that a party ~'ho has no alternative remedy can invoke

revisionary jurisdiction of Court of Appeal only upon establishment of exceptional

circumstances.

In the case of Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 SLLR 225, it was stated that,

"the trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers

of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available only if the

existence of special circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence of

this court to exercise these power0' in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then lhis court will not exercise its powers in

revis ion. "

Page 7 of 10

The Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha had considered the case of H.M.D.

Jayantha Fernando v. W.J.F. Fernandu lCA l03/86-decided on 22.10.1997],

where, Hector Yapa,J held that,

H in the present case the order thai~ was made by the Primary Court Judge

was an interim order, so that any'oerson dissatisfied with the said order t could have sought relief in the District Court ... Therefore when a dissatisfied

party has an alternative remedy, this court will not exercise its revisionary

powers unless such party can\ show the existence of exceptional

circumstances ... "

The Learned High Court Judge had further directed the parties to settle the dispute

regarding the land filing a partition case.

In the case of A.S. Paranagama v D.S~ Paranagama and others rCA (PH C)

APN 117/2013], it was held that,

"The term 'revision' means the exc.mination of a decision with a view to

correction. The material points that may arise for consideration in a

revision application inter alia are whether a subordinate Court has

exercised jurisdiction which is not vested in it in law or whether it has failed

to exercise such jurisdiction which is so vested or has acted in the exercise

of the jurisdiction illegally or in excess of jurisdiction or with material

irregularity. In other words, strictly speaking a revision application calls for

the correction of errors concerning illegalities and patent irregularities

which are of such magnitude that call for the discretionary powers of Court

to correct them.

Hence, it is the duty of a High Court and the Court of Appeal vested with the

revisionary jurisdiction under th,'! Constitution, to ensure that the

f

Page 8 of 10

revisionary powers of such Courts are not invoked as a matter of course, at

the expense of a successful party il;1 the original Court having to needlessly

wait for the fruits of his victory to be reaped ... "

In the case of M.M.P. Fernando v S.1\;I. Podimanike and others rCA (PUC)

APN 113/2010], it was held that,

HIt is well established principle thc~ a party who has no alternative remedy

can invoke revisionary jurisdiction of Court of Appeal only upon

establishment of exceptional circiJl1stances ... Further I would also like to

consider a judgment of Justice U~alagama in Devi Property Development

(Pvt) ltd., and another vs Lanka AJedical (Pvt) ltd., C.A.518/01 decided on

20.06.2001. His Lordship in the scid judgment observed thus: "Revision is

an extraordinary jurisdiction v~.sted in court to be exercised under

exceptional circumstances, if no other remedies are available. Revision is

not available until and unless other remedies available to the Petitioner are

exhausted ... "

The Learned Magistrate of Attanagalle, in the order dated 21.07.2006, had stated

as follows;

" ... ~~:> cra2md-&~2m ~~ avd:> ctJd'9 @Z5) ltli.53 cr@i.53v:>82m@) ~d-&~ 2md~

~ .. @Z5)2Sf ~1ZS")C) tsJ2Sf253 5~ZS") cr:>2m:>d~c) tsJ:~253 5~@C) z5)~@ 2md@ ... "

Accordingly we find that the Learned Magistrate had acted well within the

provisions of the Primary Courts Procedu::~e Act and the Learned High Court Judge

had correctly affirmed the said order.

Page 9 of 10

Considering that the Appellants have failed to tender a copy of the entire case

record to the High Court which in fact is a violation of Court of Appeal rules, we

are of the view that this appeal should have been dismissed in limine.

Anyway we considered the merits of the case and find that the Appellants had

failed to establish exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of the High Court

and therefore the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha had correctly dismissed

the revision application.

Appeal is hereby dismissed with costs.
