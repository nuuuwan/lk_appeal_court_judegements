Samayawardhena, J.

This is an application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum

filed by the 17th defendant-petitioner dated 17.12.2013 seeking

to set aside the Judgment of the District Court of Kurunagala in

Case No. 1727/P dated 10.06.1991, the Order of the District

Court of Kurunagala in the same case dated 06.07.2005 and the

Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunagala in

Case No. 126/2005(F) dated 09.11.2011.

This is a partition action. The Judgment of the District Court

has been delivered on 10.06.1991. No appeal has been filed

against the Judgment.

In the Judgment, 1/12 share of the land has been left

unallotted. This portion has been depicted as Lot 3 in the Final

Partition Plan.

The 17th defendant (together with 16, 18-22 defendants) has

made a joint application to the District Court dated 02.02.2005,

claiming the said unallotted Lot upon the facts stated therein.

After the inquiry, the learned District Judge has partly allowed

that application by Order dated 06.07.2005. The 17th defendant

has not appealed against that Order.

Being aggrieved by this Order, the 16, 18-22 defendants have

gone before the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunagala, but

the High Court of Civil Appeal by Judgment dated 09.11.2011

has affirmed the Order of the District Court. There is no appeal

to the Supreme Court from that Judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal.

One of the reliefs sought by the 17th defendant before this Court

is to set aside the said Judgment of the High Court of Civil

Appeal. In the first place, the 17th defendant was not an

appellant in the appeal filed before the High Court of Civil

Appeal. In any event, this relief cannot be granted as this Court

has no jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the Judgments of the

High Court of Civil Appeal by way of a final appeal, revision or

restitutio in integrum. Only the Supreme Court has that

jurisdiction. This Court and the High Court of Civil Appeal have

concurrent or parallel jurisdiction over the Judgments and

Orders of the District Courtvide my Judgment in Munasinghe

v. Ariyawansa CA/RI/15/2018 delivered on 02.11.2018. The

learned counsel for the 17th defendant informs Court that he

does not pursue that relief.

The substantive relief sought by the 17th defendant is to set

aside the Judgment of the District Court entered more than 22

years ago. This he seeks on the basis that the learned District

Judge has failed to investigate the title to the land! It is

interesting to note that the 17th defendant does not specifically

state the share he is entitled to, nor such a relief has been

prayed for in the prayer to this application. It may be recalled

that the 17th defendant was given a share (but not the full share

she expected) from the unallotted Lot when she made the

application to the District Court.

The learned counsel for the 17th defendant drawing attention to

section 25 of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977, as amended, and

case law, submits that, as this is a partition action which is an

action in rem, the moment this Court realizes that the District

Judge has failed in his duty to properly investigate the title to

4

the land, whether it is shown by a party or not, and whether

there is a delay or not, it is incumbent on this Court to set aside

the Judgment of the District Court. I cannot agree with that

submission. There cannot be a uniform rule of that nature, and

that shall depend on facts and circumstances of each individual

case.

In this case, the petitioner has been made a party as the 17th

defendant about 5 years after the registration of the Final

Decree. He, at that time, accepted the Judgment and made his

claim (together with some other parties) to only Lot 3 of the Final

Partition Plan, which has been left unallotted. His application

was partly allowed, and the appeal preferred against that Order

was dismissed. Can the 17th defendant, more than 2 years after

the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal, and more than 8

years after the Order of the District Court, and more than 22

years after the Judgment of the District Court, now file this

revision application seeking to set aside the Judgment of the

District Court on the basis that the District Judge has failed to

investigate the title to the land? I would most certainly answer

that question in the negative. I do not say that the District

Judge has failed to investigate the title. In my view, in the facts

and circumstances of this case, consideration of that question

simply does not arise.

As Chief Justice Sansoni stated in Cassim v. Government Agent,

Batticaloa1 There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect

orders have to go unreversed.

I must also emphasize that parties cannot present their cases or

take up defences in piecemeal.

Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code says that Every

application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the

exercise of the court's power or authority, or otherwise to invite its

interference, constitutes an action.

Section 34(1) and (2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads thus:

1) Every action shall include the whole of the claim which the

plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action;

but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order

to bring the action within the jurisdiction of any court.

2) If a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or intentionally

relinquishes any portion of, his claim, he shall not afterwards

sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished. A

person entitled to more than one remedy in respect of the

same cause of action may sue for all or any of his remedies;

but if he omits (except with the leave of the court obtained

before the hearing) to sue for any of such remedies, he shall

not afterwards sue for the remedy so omitted.

The doctrine of res judicata applies to all matters which existed

at the time of giving the judgment and the party had an

opportunity of bringing before Court.

In Banda vs. Karohamy2, Justice Nagalingam with Chief Justice

Howard agreeing stated: I am inclined to think that the doctrine

of res judicata applies to all matters which existed at the time of

2 (1948) 50 NLR 369 at 373

the giving of the judgment and which the party had an

opportunity of bringing before the Court. In this case it is quite

obvious that the present plaintiff had the fullest opportunity of

bringing before the Court his claim of title to the land based upon

the conveyance (P1), for at the date he filed answer the title

conveyed by P1 had vested in him and there was nothing to

prevent him from pleading that title as well. The present plaintiff

not having done so and not having obtained an adjudication upon

that title in the former suit, the decree in that suit must therefore

be deemed to operate as res judicata in regard to the present

assertion of his claim. For these reasons I hold the judgment of

the learned District Judge is right. The appeal therefore fails and

is dismissed with costs. (vide also Jane Nona v. Mohamadu3,

Sinniah v. Eliakutty4)

The doctrine of res judicata, as Justice Bandaranayake (later

Chief Justice) in Stassen Exports Ltd v. Lipton Ltd5 expressed,

has found justification in two fundamental principles: The first

principle, which is public in nature, is based on the maxim interest

rei publicae ut sit finis litium (in the interest of the state that there

be an end to litigation) and secondly on the footing of a maxim,

private in nature, namely, nemo debet bis vexari pro un at eadem

causa (that no person should be proceeded against twice for the

same cause).

This is a revision application. Revision is a discretionary

remedy. The application, in my view, is misconceived in law. I

refuse the application of the 17th defendant with costs.

Before I part with this Judgment, I shall mention about the

application made by the 1A defendant, namely, W.A. Anura

Keerthi, whereby he seeks to challenge the aforementioned

Order (not the Judgment) of the District Court and the

Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal on the ground that

he was not aware of the inquiry into the Lot 3 of the Final

Partition Plan, which was left unallotted. He says that he is

entitled to some rights from that Lot. He has not made an

application to the District Court regarding it, nor had he been a

party to the appeal made to the High Court of Civil Appeal. The

learned counsel for the 1A defendant states that a reference has

been made in the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal

about the claim of the 1A defendant. If that is the case, as I

stated at the outset, this Court has no jurisdiction to review the

said findings.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd6,

the Supreme Court (led by Chief Justice Sharvananda) citing

Loku Menika v. Selenduhamy7, Habibu Lebbe v. Punchi Etana8,

Caldera v. Santiagopulle9, Weeratne v. Secretary, D.C. Badulla10,

Dingirihamy v. Don Bastian11, Bank of Ceylon v. Liverpool Marine

& General Insurance Co Ltd12, Nagappan v. Lankabarana Estates

Ltd13 held that: A party seeking to canvass an order entered ex-

parte against him must apply in the first instance to the court

which made it. This is a rule of practice which has become deeply

ingrained in our legal system.

In Jana Shakthi Insurance v. Dasanayake14 Justice

Wimalachandra stated: It is settled law that a party affected by

an order of which he had no notice must apply in the first

instance to the Court which made the order. The petitioner must

first file the necessary papers in the original Court and initiate an

inquiry into the allegations made by him. After such inquiry, if the

petitioner is dissatisfied with the order made by the District Court,

he can thereafter raise the matter before the Court of Appeal. The

Court of Appeal then would be in a position to make an order on

the issues after taking into consideration the order made by the

District Court. In Penchi v. Sirisena15 also Justice

Wimalachandra took the same view.

This dispute seems to be between 1A defendant on the one

hand, and the 14th and 15th defendants on the other. That is a

different dispute, which has no relevance to the application of

the 17th defendant-petitioner.

Subject to making any application before the District Court, if so

advised, the application of the 1A defendant is dismissed

without costs.
