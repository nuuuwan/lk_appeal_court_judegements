/i.H.M.D. Na-\vaz, 1. ill y an indictment dated 14 June 2012, the accused appellant (who was the

first accused) was indicted along wi[h Kangaratnam Kamaladas alias Kutty

to stand trial in the High Court of J affna on the following counts:

I) On or around 22nd November 2007 at ChavakachcherL the first accused by

taking one Nadesan Sujatha who ,vas under 16 years of age from her lawful

guardian or from the keeping of the lawful guardjan committed the offence of

kidnapping/an offence punishable under Section 354 of the Penal Code.

-~ 2) At the same time, place and in the course of the same transaction, the 2nd

accused by aiding and abetting the pt accused in the commission of the

offence referred to in the first count, committed an offence punishable under

Section 354 of the Penal Code read with Section 102 of the said Code.

3) In the course of the same transaction referred to in the first count, on or

around 2yd November 2007, at Chavakachcheri, the pt accused committed

rape on Nadesan Sujatha /a minor under 16 years of age/an offence punishable

under Section 364 (2) ( e ) of the Penal Code, as amended by Penal Code

(Amendment) Act, No 22 of 1995.

4) In the course of the same transaction on or around 24th November 2007 at

Chavakachcheri, the pt accused committed rape on Nadesan Sujatha/ an

offence punishable under Section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code, as amended

by Penal Code (Amendment) Act, No 22 of 1995.

5) In the course of same transaction on or around '25th November 2007 at

Chavakachcheri the pt accused committed rape on Nadesan Sujatha /a minor

1 . .mder 16 years or age~an C<CilCC ~:m<shablC tmder Section 364 (2) ( e) of the

Penal Code, as amended by Fer.:.al Code (AJflendment) Act, No 22 of 1995.

As could be seen, whilst the 1st count referred to kidnapping of Nadesan Sujatha

on the part of the pt accused, the yd, 4th and 5th counts in the indictment ascribed

rape of the said Nadesan Sujatha to the pt accused (the appellant in this Court)

on three dates namely 23rd, 24th and 25th November 2007. The 2nd accused only

faced a count of aiding and abetting the appellant in the commission of

kidnapping Nadesan Sujatha ~a charge laid in count 2 in the indictment.

The victim of the alleged offence Nadesan Sujatha testified on 6.5.2013 narrating

..... ~ __ ... _ .... GiS. to how the J st accused~ her brotht:IjJ1_1a w whQ. was' married to her sileI_s~t ~

about committing the above offences. On the day in question namely 22/11/2007,

When Sujatha had been staying at her sister's house in Chavakachcheri and her

mother was away, the 2nd accused Kamaladas alias Kutti took her away on a

bicycle to a place called Nunawil and left her at his relative's house. It would

appear that this had been done at the bidding of the brother~in~law of the

prosecutrix~the pt accused in the case who is the appellant before this Court.

The testimony of the prosecutrix SUjatha who was under 16 years of age on

22.11.2007 was that on the following day namely 23.11.2007 the appellant came to

Nunawil and transported her in a bus to Irupalai. The 2nd accused had also

accompanied the pt accused in taking away the prosecutrix to Irupalai. The

prosecutrix testified that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her on the

night of 2yd November 2007 in a house in Irupalai where she had been taken by

the appellant.

On the 24th November 2007, Sujatha's mother~ Yogammah who had been

frantically searching for Sujatha finally traced her in hupalai and brought her

home. This testimony of Sujatha was given in the presence of the appellant and

the 2nd accused and the trial was adjourned for further examination in chief for

lOth June 2013, by which time the 2nd accused began to abscond and evaded

appearing in the High Court. The State Counsel thereafter made an application

for a Section 241 inquiry and while ordering a trial in absentia against the 2nd

accused, the learned High Court judge fixed the matter for further trial.

When the further trial came up on 11.3.2014, the Counsel for the appellant

intimated to Court that the appellant was admitting the charges (sic) laid against

him namely counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 in the indictment. It would appear that the

Learned High Court judge did not act on this intimation and instead fixed the

matter for further examination in chief of the prosecutrix, to be conducted in the

afternoon on the same day.

-~-+If-therewas a forthcoming plea to th(indie~med-High Court judge-

could have recorded the plea and proceeded to con'1ction and sentence but

rather in this particular instance, the prosecutrix was further examined in chief

by the State Counsel in the afternoon on the same day. After the State Counsel

had concluded his examination in chief, the Learned High Court Judge

proceeded to pose a few questions of the prosecutrix.

Thereafter, Nadesan Yogamma, the mother of the prosecutrix Sujatha, from

whose guardianship Sujatha had been taken away, testified on the same day. In

her evidence Yogamma narrates as to how he tracked her daughter down in

Irupalai, and she was emphatic that the pt accused (her son in law) had taken

her daughter away without her consent. Next followed the investigating officer

with whose testimony the State Counsel informed Court that he was concluding

the trial against the 2nd accused~see the proceedings dated pt July 2014.

Why should the State Counsel close the case only against the 2nd accused? What

happens to the trial against the appellant? Nothing is apparent on the record as

to the fate of the trial against the pt accused~the appellant in the case. This Court

is kept wondering as to why the case against the absent accused alone was being

concluded, whilst the case against the pt accused (the case against the appellant)

was kept open. This Court cannot be kept in darkness by the paucity of the

judge's observations and absence of journal entries that would explain as to why

the learned High Court judge adopted this procedure as he did. The learned

High Court Judge compounds and confounds the confusion by fixing the case for

judgment on 1.07.2014 to be delivered on 25th July 2014, when the counsel for the

state submitted that he was closing the case only of the absent 2nd accused. If

judgment was fixed after the case against the 2nd accused had concluded, what

happened to the case of the appellant who expressed willingness to plead?

Why was not that case closed? Why was not the plea of the appellant taken and

disposed of before the case was fixed for judgment? This case, I must say, teems

with procedural irregularities which remain unexplained. What was the

rationale for not having tendered for cross examination by the defence, two

stellar witnesses for the prosecution namely the prosecutrix Sujatha and her

mother?

Did the defence counsel refrain from cross~examining the witnesses because she

had already stated to Court on 11.03.2014 that the appellant had admitted the counts

(sic) in the indictment? So when the State Counsel closed the case on 1.07.2014

and the Court fixed the case for judgment for 25.07.2014, was it on the basis that

the case against the appellant had concluded? I would say non sequitur ~it does not

follow at all. The procedure adopted by the judge begs 'the question. One cannot

make head or tail of the )Vhys and wherefores of the procedures adopted by the

Learned High Court Judge. Neither the State Coun~el nor the Learned High

Court Judge has been cognizant of the procedural enactment~the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No 15 of 1979 as amended.

On the day fixed for judgment namely 26th July 2014, the judge was on furlough

and the case was fixed for 7.08.2014~ On 7.08.2014 the Judge has recorded that

the pt accused (the appellant) was withdrawing his previous plea of not guilty

and permission was granted for this course. He has also recorded that the pt

accused informed Court that he was admitting the charg~ (sic). It was on this day

that the High Court Judge recorded the plea of the appellant (the pt accused in

the case) and permitted both the defence counsel and state counsel to make oral

submissions.

Though Professor Zaffrullah who appeared for the appellant submitted that the

procedure adopted by the judge was erroneous, there was a countervailing

argument against this contention. Having kept silent right along when both the

prosecutrix and her mother were giving evidence, can the defence now be heard

to complain of prejudicial conduct of a case when the accused has taken the

... opportunity on 7.8~~O~4 lo_plead gu~ty to the counts in the indictmen~ a~~ let

his counsel make submissions on his behalf in mitigation of a sentence?

The voluntary plea and submissions in mitigation of the sentence would put paid

to any argument that the whole proceedings resulted in a nullity and in fact the

submissions of Professor Zaffrullah did not go so far as to invoke a nullification

of the proceedings though we take the view that the learned High Court judge

should have been more circumspect in the way he was conducting the course of

the trial. A whole host of lingering doubts should have been clarified by the

learned High Court judge. There should have been observations as to why the

defence chose not to cross examine the prosecutrix and her mother. Was an

opportunity to cross examine the witnesses offered at ali? Even if the defence had

kept mute as to cross examination owing to an earlier submission that the

accused would be pleading guilty presently, there must have been recording by

the learned High Court Judge of the fact that the accused was forgOing his right

to cross examination. In fact cross examination being a double edged sword, the

responses to questions posed in cross examination could well form a foundation

for mitigatory submissions which not only the High Court judge but also this

Court could take cognizance of in the dispensation of a legal sentence.

VVhy was the plea recorded virtually on a d::iY long after the judgmenl: was fixed

for? Was the trial against the}"t accused (appellant) kept open? Was it the case

that only the trial against the 2nd accused who was tried in absentia was fixed for

judgment and not that of the pt accused? In other words did the High Court

separate the trials of the two accused. who were jointly indicted? These are

questions that remain unans\vered and the record cannot be so empty and bare

as Mother Hubbard's cupboard furnishing no clear answers to these questions. I

must however say that these questions were not argued as determinative

questions of law and I am recording them here so that presiding judges would do

well to avoid these pitfalls that would expose a good case to an abortive trial.

I venture to think that it does not lie ~n the mouth of the appellant to argue that

there has been a failure of justice in the instant case, when there was a conscious

plea and a consequent mitigatory submission despite the above infirmities that

preceded the plea. In fact the proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution states as

follows:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure ofjustice.

In the circumstances this Court is not inclined to interfere with the conviction

as it was entered after a voluntary plea.

Professor Zaffrullah next argued that the sentence imposed for rape namely 10

years' R.I must be lowered though it is the mandatory minimum sentence

stipulated for this offence. He cited the SC Reference I:'/o 3/2008 from the High

Court of Anuradhapura in Case No 333/2004 wherein the Supreme Court in a

unanimous determination held that "the minimum mandatory sentence in

Section 362 (2) (e) is in conflict with Articles 4 (c ), 11 and 12 (1) of the

Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence

that it deems appropriate In the exercise of its judicial discretion

notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence" -see 2008 Bar Association

Law Reports Part II in the Bar Association Law Journal (2008) Volume XIV, page

160.

Minimum Mandatory Sentences

In this case Count No 1 was on kidnapping whilst Counts No 3, 4 and 5 pertained

to rape of the underaged Sujatha on three different dates. The High Court

imposed a sentence of 2 years' rigorous imprisonment for kidnapping whilst a

sentence of 10 years' R.I was imposed on the 3rd count of rape. Though the

. appellant pleaded guHty to ~_and5th_collnts, thelearnedHigh Court judgeLtUite

rightly refrained from convicting and sentencing the appellant on the 4th and 5th

counts as there was no evidence at all to find him guilty on the two counts. In

fact the High Court Judge had due regard to the evidence of Sujatha which did

not establish the offences recited in counts 4 and 5 of the indictment The High

Court Judge ordered that the sentence of 2 years' R.I for kidnapping should run

concurrently with the period of 10 years' R.I which was imposed for rape on the

third count.

Professor Zaffrullah pleaded that the sentence of 10 years' R.I which is the

stipulated minimum for rape of an underaged girl in terms of Section 362 (2)

(e) of the Penal Code should be reduced below 10 years.

I have already observed in Geoffrey Anthony Thilan Amarasekara v The

Honourable Attorney General (CA Case No. 149 / 2012 decided on

17.09.2015) that whether a sentence is excessive or lenient in light of the facts

and circumstances of a particular caEJe is a question of law which this Court is

bound to consider in appeal and as I observed in Bandage SumindraJayanthl

v Han. Attorney-General CA 251-267/2012 (He Vavuniya decided on

3.07.2015), the parties must be able to demonstrate to the appellate court the

existence of both aggravating and mitigatory circumstances in the case for the

reviewing court to assess the propriety of the sentence meted out. Such

circumstances may be manifest in the evidence led, submissions made and the

judgment pronounced containing the sentence. Do these indicia apply in a case

where the legislature has imposed a minimum mandatory sentence?

In fact as Justice Gamini Amaratunga J commented in Maramba liyanage

Rohana alias Loku v the Han Attorney General (2011) 2 Sri.LR 174 at 178 (with

J.A.N.de Silva CJ and Ratnayake J concurring), the unanimous determination

of the Supreme Court in SC Reference No 3 of 2008 (supra) removed the knot of

mandatory sentences which up to that time tied the hands of trial judges with

regard to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in the circumstances of the

particular case tried by them. This was the argument that Professor Zaffrullah

mounted to urge a reduction in the sentence. So a quick look at SC Reference

No 3 of 2008 (supra) is quite pertinent.

This is a case where both the accused and the complainant were under age and

had been having a love affair consequent to which they eloped and had sexual

intercourse. The respective parents finally traced and brought them back home.

In light of the facts that emerged as above, the Learned High Court judge of

Anuradhapura addresseda reference to the Supreme Court posing a question in

the reference whether Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code as amended by Penal

Code (Amendment) Act, No 22 ofI99S had removed the judicial discretion when

sentencing an accused convicted for an offence punishable under Section 364 (2)

(e) of the Penal Code.

" .

When the reference was taken up for determination' before a Bench of Three

judges of the Supreme Court, the Learned Senior State Counsel who appeared as

amicus curiae on behalf of the Attorney General raised the issue of a post

enactment review that would loom large in the event,the Supreme Court went

on to hold that the minimum mandatory sentence did not fetter the discretion of

judges at all.

The Supreme Court was quite alive to the embargo_oll-post_enactment review of

legislation postulated in Article 80 (3) of the Constitution, which goes as follows:

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the

case may be, being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce

upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground

whatsoever.

~ .. The Suprellle Court was quick to point out that ~hey\V~re not venturil1g_~~J?:t() ~

questioning of the legislation namely the validity of Penal Code (Amendment)

Act No, 22 of 1995 which 'had brought in the minimum mandatory sentence but

rather they were only indulging in an interpretation of the provision in light of

the special circumstances of the case that was before them namely an underaged

lover who had eloped with an equally underaged girl and had sex with her owing

to an ongoing amour. In other words in SC Reference No 3 of 2008, the Court

thought it fit to take into account the fact that both the prosecutrix and the

accused were children in the eyes of the law and the~r best interest should be

addressed. In such a situation should the accused be visited with a 10 year long

incarceration? Or can they go down a sliding scale below 10 years? The Court

pointed out that there was a discretion which enabledthe judges to go below 10 .:' .0' years though this was the minimum imposed by the legislature. This

interpretation is quite consistent with the view held on minimum mandatory

sentences. Equitable jurisdiction possessed by our Co'urts also helps Court to

temper the rigours of statutory law and SC Reference No 3 of 2008 was one such

occasion on which this trend once again manifested.

Jt is not irrelevant at this stage to quote Sir Louis Blorn-Cooper QC who in his

compelling collection of essays titled Power of Persuasion Essays by a Very Public

Lawyer postulates the follOwing articulation on minimum mandatory sentences

at page 106:

The mandatory sentence reduces the court's normalsentendngjunction to the level of

a rubber stamp: It negates the idea of individualism in the sentencing of an offender.

The morally just and the morally reprehensible are Similarly treated for their

culpability in crime ................ Judicial policy is opposed to mandatory sentences; indeed

a separate function, even a distribution of power, should debar this legislative

interference with judicial control. The sound administration of justice and its social

image determines abolition in favour of a discretionary sentence. In terms of human

nghts law, human rights are not commodities; tnejare creatUres Inner-en tTy endowed

with qualities that are ends in themselves, and not merely means to an end. One of the

elements of the dignity of the individual is the 'right to hope' that an indeterminate

sentence is always subject to a 'dedicated review mechanism' at the time of sentence.

Thus the introduction of a discretionary element by common law reasoning into

the minimum mandatory sentence introduced by Act No 22 of 1995 is consonant

I with such articulate premises as human rights law and it is settled law today that

~hen an accused is to be' sentenced for an offence under Section 364 ( 2) ( e) of

the Penal Code as amended by Act No 22 of 1999, the learned High Court Judge

can go upwards and forWards having the 10 year stipulation as a benchmark.

In fact Ratnayake J pointed out the circumstances where a judge would go . , upwards beyond the 10 year minimum.

There may well be exceptional cases in which an offenc,e may be so serious in nature

that irrespective of the circumstances a Court may never exercise judicial discretion in . . .

favour of a punishment that is less than an appropriate minimum mandatory

punishment. The reasoning in Re: Prevention of Organized Crime Bill relates to such

an exceptional case. The Supreme Court in Re: Prevention of Organized Crime Bill in

fact contrasted the serious nature of the oJJenccs in Re: Prev~ntion of Organized Crime

Bill with far lesser offences in Re: Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms afViolence

in Educational Institutions Bill. A minimum ma~4qt{)ry~u~!~hment of appropriate

severity for such serious offences would not be inconsistent with Articles 4 (c), 11 and

12 (1).

As far as Section 364 (2) ( e) of the Penal Code (as amended by Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No 22 of1995) is concerned, the High Court has been prevented from

imposing a sentence that it feels is appropriate in the exercise of its judicial discretion

due to the minimum mandatory punishment prescribed in Section 364 (2). Having

regard to thenature oj the offence and the severity oj theminimurn rnandatorysentence,

we hold that the minimum mandatory sentence in Section 364 (2) ( e) is in conflict with

Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Thus the Supreme Court felt impelled to pinpoint that a Section 364 (2) ( e)

offence does not impose a fetter on the sentencer. Once the discretionary element

is introduced, it is then the extenuating and aggravating circumstances that

would count for consideration at the time of sentencing. It is for this reason that

I posed a question in an anterior part of this judgment~ Do these

indicia ( extenuating and aggravating circumstances) apply in a case where the

legislature has imposed a minimum mandatory sentence for an offence under

Section 364 (2)? The answer is in the affirmative.

I must observe that subsequent cases in the Supreme Court that turned on

Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code applied the above indicia in: the review of

sentences which the appellants in those cases sought~see Gamini Amaratunga J

in Maramba Liyanage Rohana alias Loku v the Hon Attorney General

(supra): Shirani Tilakawardane, J in Dharma Sri llssaKumara W.ijenaile v

Hon.Attorney General (SC Appeal 179/2012 SC minutes of 8.9.2013) and Eva

Wanasundera P.C J in Hon.Attorney General v Ambagala Mudiyanselage

Samantha Sampath (S.C.Appeal No 17/2013 decided on 12.03.2005). The Court

of Appeal too has adopted this approach~see . Anil Gooneratne J in

Hirimuthugoda Sanjeewa Shantha alias Ran Mama v Han. Attorney General

-- ------- ~---.. --... --~.- -- -" _. - . (CA 150/2010 decided on 16.07.2014):

If one harks back to the underlying rationale in these cases, one could see that

the Courts have looked at the objective gravity of the type of crime having regard

to both aggravating and mitigatory circumstances and the fact that the necessity

to ensure justice to one party should not result in injustice to the other side.

Provided that the reviewing Court can go below 10 years, has the appellant made

- ------~ntiaLand-c_Omplling circumstanGe-s-:i-usti~ti-ng--the--lmposition---oLa

sentence of less than 10 years' imprisonment? After a voluntary plea, the counsel

for the appellant pleaded the cause that the appellapt was a father of three

children and though the victim was a sister in law bf the accused, she was

married at the time of the trial. It was these circumstances that were placed

before the learned High ~ourt Judge in mitigation of the sentence. Even though

SC Reference No 3 of 2008 has recognized that the legislative provision namely

Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code as amended is not so prescriptive in its terms .. i to strip the sentencing court of its sentencing discretion, it would entitle a Court . . ~ ':I to impose a lesser sentepce than the sentence prescribed only if the Court is

satisfied that substantial ~nd compelling circumstance~ do exist.

Here was a brother in laW who should have been in loco parentis to an underaged

sister in law. She had repaired to the comfort of his home to go to school. He

owed her what I would c~ll fiduciary care in the absence of her father and it goes

against the grain to entice and inveigle such a girl of IS years of age, however

acquiescent she might have been in accompanying his-acolyte (the 2nd accused),

and engage in sexual activity. It is clear that the prosecutrix was kidnapped ~q

charge that the appellant pleaded. This was not a case where two underaged

, . lovers as in SC Reference ,No 03 of 2008 decamped from home and had sex. Th~

; evidence of the prosecutrix was not assailed or impugned in cross examination

and her testimonial creditworthiness was not dented. No compensation has been

ordered against the appellant in view of the fact thatthe presecutrix left home

consensually. However I take the view that societal mores demand that the

conduct on the part of the appellant cannot be condoned and must be viewed

with disfavor.

In the circumstances I take the view that a sentence of 10 years' rigorous

imprisonment imposed on the appellant was quite coridign and we do not wish

to alter the sentence imposed by the learned High CouttJudge on 7.08.2014. We

therefore affirm the conviction and sentence of the appellant effective from

~ --~--~--~-~-------.--.---~------- -.., ----~-~~---~---- - . 7.08.2014. The appeal is thus dismissed.
