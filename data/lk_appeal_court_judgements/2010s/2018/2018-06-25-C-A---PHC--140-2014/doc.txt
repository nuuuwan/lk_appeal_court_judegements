Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the order dated 4th December 2014 by the learned High Court Judge of

the Uva Province Holden in Badulla by which he refused notice in the revision application filed by

the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant).

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) filed a certificate in the Magistrates

Court of Bandarawela under section 38(2) ofthe Employees Provident Fund Act as amended (Act)

to recover a sum of Rs. 24,57,414.90 as provident fund dues for the period 01.01.2004 to

30.06.2004 from the Appellant.

Upon summons been issued a representative of the Appellant appeared in Court on 03.04.2007

and admitted liability to pay the amount in default in instalments. Accordingly, a sum of Rs.

200,000/= had been paid upto 02.10.2007.

Page 2 of9

No payments were made thereafter by the Appellant. Thereafter names of two Directors of the

Appellant, namely Rajaratnam Vinothan and Anthony Ruwan Sanjeewa had been submitted to

Court. Later, on an application made on his behalf Anthony Ruwan Sanjeewa had been

discharged.

Rajaratnam Vinothan had appeared in Court for the first time on 24.06.2014 and was enlarged

on bail. The next date his foreign travel was prohibited and, on his application, he was granted

time to pay the sum in default within a period of one year.

The Appellant submits that on 17.11.2014 the lawyers appearing for the Appellant sought to

make an application that in terms of the Act, the Commissioner of Labour cannot file a certificate

in the Magistrates Court under section 38(2) of the Act in the first instance without having

proceeded under sections 17 and 38(1) of the Act and therefore the Magistrates Court did not

have jurisdiction. The Appellant submits that the learned Magistrate indicated that the said

objection could be entertained but the order will have to be reserved for another date and until

such time the Director will be remanded.

The Appellant submits that as such the lawyers for the Appellant had to refrain from making the

said application and were compelled to move for a date to pay the instalment although such

payment was not warranted by law. Thereafter, they filed a revision application in the High Court

of the Uva Province holden in Badulla seeking to dismiss the action filed by the Respondent in

the Magistrates Court.

The learned High Court judge after hearing the Appellant refused notice and hence this appeal

by the Appellant.

The Appellant urged two grounds before the High Court. Firstly, it was submitted that before

acting in terms of section 38(2) of the Act, the Respondent must act under sections 17(1) and

38(1) of the Act and it is only thereafter, that steps can be taken under section 38(2) of the Act.

Secondly, it was submitted that the learned Magistrate did not have jurisdiction under section

38(2) of the Act to substitute the directors in place of the defaulting company named in the

certificate filed under section 38(2) of the Act.

The first ground appears to have been formulated on the judgement of Tilakawardane J. in K.A.

Dayawathi v. D.S. Edirisinghe [S.c. (FR) No. 241/2008; S.C.M. 01.6.2009]. There Tilakawardane J.

held as follows:

liThe above three procedures are not alternative procedures for recovery. The legislature

very clearly has sets out the scheme step by step as to how the Commissioner becomes

entitled to use the procedures set out in Section 38(2) of the said Act. The 3rd Respondent

has no jurisdiction or power under the said statute to file a certificate in the Magistrates

Court in terms of Section 38(2) of the EPF Act without first proceeding under Section 17

and thereafter under of Section 38(1) of the said Act." (page 8 of the judgement)

I most respectfully beg to differ from the views expressed above for several reasons.

Firstly, the weight of authority of the Supreme Court is clearly in favour of giving the

Commissioner of labour a discretion on the procedure to be followed as between section 17,

38(1) and 38(2) of the Act. In Messrs Narthupana Tea & Rubber Co Ltd v. The Commissioner of

Labour [SC Appeal 510/74; S.C.M. 13.03.1978] Wimalaratne J. and Colin Thome J. held that there

is no necessity for the Commissioner to have first resorted to the other two remedies provided

in sections 17 and 38(1) before he instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court. In lewelarts

Limited v. The Land Acquiring Officer and others [C.A./Writ/App/No.1126/2004; C.A.M. of

28.01.2009] Sriskandarajah J. held that the Commissioner of labour has a discretion in deciding

between the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act. The Supreme Court

refused special leave to appeal against the said judgement in lewelarts Limited v. The Land

Acquiring Officer and others [S.c. (Special) l.A. 34/2009; S.C.M. of 22.06.2009]. In Peoples Bank

and others v. Kasthuriarachchi (2011 B.l.R. 59) the Supreme Court held that where the Supreme

Court refuses leave to appeal against a judgement of the Court of Appeal, that refusal of leave

itself becomes a decision of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, in S.c. (Special) l.A. 277/2012;

S.C.M. of 04.04.2013 TIlakawardane J. [with Sripavan J. (as he was then) and Ekanayake J.

agreeing] refused special leave to appeal in a case where the same question i.e. discretion

between the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act was the main question

urged in support of the application for special leave to appeal.

Secondly, Tilakawardane J. herself appears take a different view in K.A. Dayawathi v. D.S.

Edirisinghe(supra) that there is in fact a discretion vested in the Commissioner in deciding

between the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act. She states as follows:

"Put simply, the Pt, 2nd and 3rd Respondents are required to institute action in accordance

with Section 17. However, if and only if, the Commissioner is of the opinion that recovery

under Section 17 of the said Act is (1) impracticable and inexpedient, and/or (2) where

the full amount due has not been recovered by seizure and sale, only then can recovery

be made, and only if the Commissioner complies with the certificate issuance

requirements of 38(1) and 38(2)." (page 7 of the judgement)

Thirdly, clearly the dicta relied on by the Appellant in K.A. Dayawathi v. D.S. Edirisinghe(supra) is

not the ratio decidendi. The issue in that case was whether the arrest and detention of the

petitioner was lega/. In Yahala Kelle Estates Company (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour and

others [CA. 234/2013(writ), C.A.M. of 13.12.2013]' Chairman, Employees Trust Fund Board v.

Agro Trading Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. [CA. (Rev) 1/2010] and Assistant Labour Commissioner v.

Ranaweera [(CA(PHC)APN 92/2011, C.A.M. 29.01.2016] the Court of Appeal was of the view that

the part of the judgement relied on by the Appellant is obiter.

Fourthly, the Supreme Court did not consider the provisions in section 38(4) of the Act which

states that the provisions of that section shall have effect notwithstanding anything in section 17

of the Act. Section 38 of the Act was amended by Act No. 24 of 1971. Hence, section 17 of the

Act was part of the original Act whereas section 38 was included as an amendment. In amending

section 38, the legislature quite clearly states that the new section takes effect notwithstanding

the provisions in section 17. This is a clear pointer, that it was never the intention of the

legislature to compel the Commissioner to resort to section 17 before he takes steps under

section 38 of the Act.

For the forgoing reasons, I have no hesitation in upholding the findings of the learned High Court

judge on the question of discretion vested in the Commissioner of Labour in deciding between

the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act.

. .

Although the learned High Court judge correctly held that the Commissioner of labour has a

discretion in deciding between the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act,

in my view the question whether such a discretion was correctly exercised should never arise for

determination before the Magistrate in proceedings instituted under section 38(2) of the Act.

Where the wrongful exercise of discretion is sought to be challenged, it must be in appropriate

proceedings where administrative law principles are applicable.

The second ground urged on behalf of the Appellant is that the legislature did not vest the

Commissioner with any discretion between the procedures set out in sections 38(1) and 38(2) of

the Act and that the Commissioner must first have recourse to section 38(1) of the Act,

specifically when the defaulting employer is a legal person as opposed to a natural person. It was

further submitted that the learned Magistrate did not have jurisdiction under section 38(2) of

the Act to substitute the directors in place of the defaulting company named in the certificate

filed under section 38(2) of the Act.

This submission is tenuous and without any legal basis and I have no hesitation in rejecting it.

As explicated above, the weight of authority is that the Commissioner has a discretion in selecting

between the procedures set out in sections 17, 38(1) and 38(2) of the Act. In lewelarts

International Ltd. v. The Assistant Commissioner of Labour [CA. 745/2003, C.A.M. 08.08.2003]

Udalagama J. held that on a plain reading of section 38(1) of the Act, he was of the view that the

Commissioner is not mandated to comply with sections 17 or 38(1) of the Act initially before

resorting to section 38(2) of the Act.

There is nothing wrong in the Magistrate summoning the directors of the Appellant. It must be

pOinted out that rather than substituting the names of the directors in place of the Appellant

company as submitted by the Appellant, the learned Magistrate issued summons on the directors

of the Appellant after the Appellant admitted liability, made part payment and then defaulted.

Page 6 of9

.'

It must be noted that section 40 of the Act is a deeming provision by which every director of a

body corporate is deemed to be guilty of an offence where an offence under the Act is committed

by the body corporate. The meaning of the word Itdeemed" was considered and explained by

Ranasinghe, J. (as he then was) in Jinawathie v. Emalin [(1986) 2 SrLL.R. 121 at 130,131] in the

following words:

"In statutes, the expression deemed is commonly used for the purpose of creating a

statutory function so that a meaning of a term is extended to a subject-matter which it

properly does not designate ... Thus, where a person is deemed to be something it only

means that whereas he is not in reality that something, the Act of Parliament requires

him to be treated as if he were".

Ranasinghe, J. went onto explain the legal effect and consequences of such a legal fiction in the

following terms:

"Thus, where in pursuance of a statutory direction a thing has to be treated as something

which in reality it is not or an imaginary state of affairs is to be treated as real, then not

only will it have to be treated so during the entire course of the proceedings in which such

assumption is made but all attendant consequences and incidents, which if the imagined

state of affairs had existed would inevitably have flowed from it have also to be imagined

or treated as real". (supra. page 130)

In that context the opportunity that a director of a defaulting company gets in proceedings under

section 38(2) of the Act can be viewed as an application of the rules of natural justice.

This Court has previously approved the summoning of the directors of the defaulting company in

proceedings instituted under section 38(2) of the Act. In Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and others v.

Commissioner of Labour [(1998) 3 SrLL.R. 320 at 330] Ranaraja J. held as follows:

itA default in making payments due as EPF contributions, makes the 'employer' at the

relevant time, liable for contravening the provisions of section 10 of the Act. As an

alternative to prosecution for such an offence under section 41 of the Act or civil

proceedings under section 17 of the Act, the Commissioner is empowered to institute

proceedings against the defaulting employer for the recovery of contributions due under

the provisions of section 38 (2). The petitioners are thus liable, qua directors of the

Page 7 of9

,

offending company, to be summoned before court in proceedings under section 38 (2)

of the Act and sentenced to pay the sum in default by way of fine and serve a term of

imprisonment in lieu, if the fine remains unpaid." (emphasis added)

In Ranasinghe and another v. The Commissioner of Labour and others [CA(PHC) 69/2009; C.A.M.

27.01.2011] this Court was called upon to decide a similar issue. There the Learned Counsel for

the petitioner relying on the judgement of Tilakawardene J. in K.A.Dayawathiv.

D.5.Edirisinghe[SC(FR) No.241/2008; S.C.M. 01.6.2009] contended that failure to comply with

Section 38(2) of the EPF Act could not be considered as an offence. He further contended that if

no offence had been committed, then directors could not be brought under section 40 of the Act.

He therefore contended that making petitioners who are directors of the company, liable is

wrong.

Sisira De Abrew J. without any hesitation rejected the argument and stated as follows:

IIlf the employer is a body corporate and if it does not comply with section 38(2) of the

EPF Act, how is the Magistrate going to implement the default sentence. In short, the

question that must be considered is: if the employer is a body corporate and the amount

ordered by way of a fine is not paid, who is going to be sent to jail. Obviously, the

Magistrate cannot send the body corporate to jail. If the contention that the directors of

a body corporate cannot be sent to jail as they have not committed an offence is accepted

then the amount set out in the certificate cannot be recovered. Was this the intention of

the legislature when it enacted Section 38(2) of the EPF Act? Should Courts interpret

Statute to frustrate the intention of the legislature and the purpose of the Statute? The

answer is clearly no. At this stage it is pertinent to consider the preamble which reads as

follows: "An act to establish provident fund for the benefit of certain classes of employees

and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto." In interpreting

Section 38(2) of the EPF Act if the court holds that directors of a body corporate do not

fall within the ambit of employer in Section 38(2) of the EPF Act, then the establishment

of provident fund would almost be reduced to zero. Such an interpretation would

certainly not bring any benefit to the employees in the corporate section. Further such an

Page 8 of 9

interpretation, in my view, would defeat the purpose of the Act and lead to absurdity. In

this connection I would like to consider a passage from book titled Interpretation of

Statutes by Brinda{s;c)7th edition page 235: It is a well known rule of construction that a

statute should not be construed so as to impute absurdity to the legislature."

In my view if the Courts interpret that directors of a body corporate do not fall within

the meaning of 'employer' in Section 38(2) of the EPF Act, the Commissioner of labour

would not be able to recover contributions made by both the employees and employers

in the Corporate section and thereby would cause severe injustice to the employees in

the corporate section and the purpose of enacting Section 38(2) would be defeated."

(emphasis added)

The reasoning is logical and compelling and I have no hesitation in adopting it as the correct

exposition of the law on this issue.

For the foregoing reasons, , see no reason to interfere with the order dated 4th December 2014

by the learned High Court Judge of the Uva Province Holden in Badulla.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.

The parties in CA(PHC) 151/2014, CA(PHC) 152/2014 and CA(PHC) 153/2014 agreed to be bound

by the judgement delivered in this case as the issues to be decided in all four cases were identical.

Accordingly, the appeals bearing nos. CA(PHC) 151/2014, CA(PHC) 152/2014 and CA(PHC)

153/2014 are dismissed with costs.
