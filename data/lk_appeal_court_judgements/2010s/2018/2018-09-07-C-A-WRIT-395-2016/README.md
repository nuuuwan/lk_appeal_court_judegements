The two petitioners as public spirited citizens have filed this

application basically to prevent water pollution of Tissawewa in

Anuradhapura by human activities such as bathing, washing

vehicles, littering etc. They seek in the prayer to the petition (a) to

issue a writ of certiorari to quash the decision taken by the 1st

respondent-District Secretary of Anuradhapura to relax the

prohibition on bathing in Tissawewa by P3; (b) to issue a writ of

mandamus compelling the 1st respondent to re-impose the

prohibition contained in P2; and (c) to issue a writ of mandamus to

3

compel the 1st-4th respondents to take appropriate steps to

prevent water pollution in Tissawewa.

P2 is a Report of the District Agricultural Committee of

Anuradhapura dated 24.06.2016. According to that Report, the

Committee has inter alia discussed the subject of "taking steps to

prevent water pollution in Tissawewa due to bathing" (:

) and

"arrived at a consensus on principle to prohibit bathing in

Tissawewa" (

.) "subject to use by the residents around

Tissawewa for their daily purposes" (

).1 In my view, no

firm decision to implement forthwith prohibiting bathing in

Tissawewa has been taken by the said Committee at the said

Meeting, and this is made clear by the last paragraph of the said

section of the Report, which says that the relevant institutions

including the Municipal Council of Anuradhapura, Irrigation

Department were informed of to look into the legal position to take

steps in this regard. (,

,

.)

Be that as it may, the principal relief sought by the petitioners is to

issue a writ of certiorari to quash the decision taken by the 1st

respondent to relax the prohibition against bathing in Tissawewa

1 Vide pages 3-4 of the report.

by P3. It is the position of the petitioners that, by P3 dated

24.08.2016, the 1st respondent "relaxed the said prohibition

(contained in P2) and permitted only those who are resident around

the tank to bathe in Tissawewa until facilities for bathing will be

provided to them." This relaxation contained in P3, in my view, is

not a novel thing as the same is contained in P2 as well, as seen

from what I have quoted above from the Report of P2. The main

relief of the petitioners is therefore misconceived and cannot be

granted.

The second relief sought by the petitioners is to issue a writ of

mandamus compelling the 1st respondent to re-impose the

prohibition contained in P2. If there is no relaxation of the

prohibition contained in P2, the necessity of re-imposing the

prohibition does not arise.

The final relief sought by the petitioners is to issue a writ of

mandamus compelling the 1st-4th respondents to take appropriate

steps to prevent water pollution in Tissawewa. This relief is not

specific. The petitioners shall state precisely the appropriate steps

according to them the said respondents are legally bound to take

to prevent water pollution in Tissawewa, and only then can the

Court consider whether the respondents shall be compelled to take

such steps. Court cannot by mandamus compel the respondents

to do what they are not authorised to do or what they are unable to

do in practical terms.

The petitioners in paragraph 36 of the petition state that pollution

in Tissawewa shall be avoided (a) since it is the main source of

water for drinking purposes of the residents in the sacred area of

the city of Anuradhapura and (b) for performance of religious rites.

The (a) above was strongly supported by the Report P6 issued by

5

the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. When the

respondents in their objections took up the position that according

to the case of the petitioners National Water Supply and Drainage

Board is a necessary party, the petitioners in paragraph 4.7 of the

written submissions have taken up the position that "The

petitioners are exclusively concerned with the supply of water from

Tissawewa for performance of religious activities and they are not

so concerned with the supply of water for drinking purpose."

The respondents in their objections have taken up the position

that water of Tissawewa is not nowadays used to perform religious

rites, and this has not been disputed by the petitioners, and in

reply say that it is due to the water pollution of Tissawewa.

However there is no evidence before Court from any responsible

party including the Chief Prelate in charge of Sri Maha Bodhi that

the water of Tissawewa is not now used for religious rites due to

pollution.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.

Before I part with this Judgment it must be emphasised that there

cannot be any doubt that water pollution of Tissawewa shall be

stopped. However blanket prohibition of bathing without a viable

alternative will gravely affect the ordinary devotees who flock to

Anuradhapura for religious observances and also the daily lives of

residents in the surrounding areas. A right balance between these

two competing interests shall be the order of the day and steps in

that direction shall in my view be taken not by District Agricultural

Committees but by national level with the direct involvement of the

central government for the greater benefit of the public.
