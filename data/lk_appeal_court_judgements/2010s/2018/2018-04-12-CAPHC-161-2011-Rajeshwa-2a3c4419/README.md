JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Informant - Respondent - Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Appellants) had filed an information in the Primary Court of Jaffna

under section 66 (1) (b) as a private information complaining to the

learned Primary Court Judge that the Respondent- Petitioner - Respondents

(hereinafter sometimes respectively referred to as the 1st 2nd and 3rd

Respondents or Respondents) had attempted to disturb the peaceful

possession of the land in question.

..

. . 5

At the outset the following common grounds must be highlighted for the

purposes of convenience and clarity.

i. The Appellants had filed information under section 66 (1) (b) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Act) in the same Court! under the Case bearing

No. PC 28/09.

ii. The said case No. PC 28/09 was concluded and an order had been

delivered on 2009-12-02 to the effect that the Appellants are entitled

to the possession of the impugned land,

iii. The information in the instant case had been filed with an affidavit

dated 2010-02-23. This is less than 03 months after the order in the

previous case2 was delivered.

iv. The previous case was filed only against the 3rd Respondent.3

v. The 3rd Respondent inducing 1st and 2nd Respondents disturbed the

possession of the Appellants on 2010-02-04,4

1 Primary Court of Jaffna.

2 Case No. PC 28/09

3 Paragraph 18 of the affidavit dated 2010-02-23 filed by the Appel!ants.

4 Paragraph 07 & 15 of the affidavit dated 2010-02-23 filed by the Appellants.

6

vi. The 3rd Respondent had stated in his affidavit filed in the previous

case that he had been enjoying this property as an agent of the 1st

and 2nd Respondents.5

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had by

his order dated 2010-11-30, directed that the Appellants are entitled to the

possession of the land in dispute.

It is important to note that the learned Primary Court Judge in his order

dated 2010-11-30, makes the following assertions clear.

I. The incident in the instant case had occurred when attempting to

execute the order of the Court in the previous case (i.e. PC 28/09).

II. The informants should have taken steps to invoke the provision

under section 73 of the Act.

III. He had taken the said view right from the beginning of this case but

had proceeded to hold an inquiry upon the consent of both parties.

5 Paragraph 21 of the affidavit dated 2010-02-23 filed by the Appellants.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Respondents had made a revision application to the Provincial

High Court of Northern Province holden in Jaffna urging the Provincial High

Court to revise the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, by its judgment dated

2011-05-25 had allowed the said application for revision and proceeded to

set aside the order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

The basis upon which the learned Provincial High Court Commissioner had

set aside the judgment of the Primary Court are twofold. They are as

follows;

a) That the parties to a dispute of this nature cannot confer jurisdiction

to Court,

b) Learned Primary Court Judge had failed to consider whether there

was a breach of peace before proceeding to inquire into the instant

case.

8

Learned Provincial High Court Commissioner had directed thatth

core as at the date of instituting this case should be maintained

relevant District Court case is decided.

It would be relevant at this juncture to turn to section 69 (2) of

which is as follows;

S. 69 (2)

" ... An order under this subsection may declare that any person ".

therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting the

any part of the land as may be spec:ified in the order until such

deprived such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent Cou~/

and prohibit all disturbance or interference withthe exercise of such right

by such party other than under the authority of an order or decree as

t: 'd" a,oresal ....

Indeed learned Primary Court Judge at the conclusion of his order dated

2009-12-026 had stated that any person who violates that order would be

punished under the provisions in section 73 of the Act.

It is unfortunate that the Appellants for the reasons best known to them or

to their learned counsel, had not taken any step to deal with the persons

who are alleged to have contravened the order of the Primary Court in the

case No PC 28/2009.

It is clear that the rival parties in the previous case (i.e. No PC 28/2009)

are rival parties in the instant case too. The effect of the order of the

Primary Court in the case No PC 28/2009 is that it was the Appellants who

are entitled to the possession of the disputed land. This order had been

delivered on 2009-12-02. This means that it should be the Appellants who

should be entitled to the possession of the said land even as at the date on

which the information in the instant case was filed with an affidavit dated

2010-02-23. This is because the previous order of Court is binding on the

parties. It is not open for such parties to re agitate the same matter in the

same forum after the lapse of such short period. It is unfortunate that

learned Prif\lary Court Judge had knowingly entertained this case in such a

situation.

For the foregoing reasons this Court decides to set aside both the order

dated 2010-11-30 of the learned Primary Court Judge of Jaffna and the

order dated 2011-05-25 of learned Provincial High Court Commissioner of

----------------

Jaffna. This Court further directs that the order of the Primary Court in the

case bearing No. PC 28/2009 must remain in force subject to law, as it is

erroneous to entertain a second case on the same matter.
