This is a revision application filed by the accused-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as "accused")

against the judgment of the learned High Court judge of Chilaw dated 2014.12.17.

On 20.09.2005, the accused was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw on two counts by the

complainant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as "complainant"), namely under sections 354

and 363(e) of the Penal Code. As it was reported that the accused was abroad, trial proceeded

against him in absentia. He was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to terms of 5 years

R.I. and 12 years R.I. respectively. The sentences were to run separately. Additionally, he was

directed to pay a fine of Rs. 7500/- each on the first and second charges in lieu of which a

sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment was imposed on each charge. The accused was also

directed to pay a sum of Rs. 75,000/- as compensation to the prosecutrix in lieu of which a

sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment was imposed.

The accused submitted that he was taken into custody by the Chilaw Police on 22.10.2000 and

produced before the Magistrates Court of Chilaw in case bearing No. 20415/NS on an allegation

that he had on or about 18.09.2000 committed an offence punishable under sections 354 and

363(e) of the Penal Code. The accused further stated that somewhere in February 2001 he was

informed by the Magistrates Court that no further proceedings would be taken against him in

the said case in the said Magistrates Court and was warned to appear in the High Court of Chilaw

if and when he receives notice/summons from the said High Court. The accused states that he

was faced with severe financial hardships and after making inquiries whether proceedings had

been instituted in the High Court proceeded abroad for employment on 23.04.2003. Before doing

so he states that he advised his mother, one of the sureties for him in the Magistrate's Court, to

look out for any notices/summons from the High Court of Chilaw. The accused further stated that

he requested the Grama Niladhari of the area he was living to inform his mother if any inquiries

are made about his whereabouts so that he could return to Sri Lanka and appear before the said

High Court. He stated that later as his mother was the only occupant of the house they were

living in, she went to live with her relations at Lunuwila, Wennappuwa.

2

The accused states that the first time he heard about the proceedings in the High Court of Chilaw

is when a news item appeared in a Sinhala daily that a case on the incident referred to above had

proceeded against him in absentia in the High Court of Chi law and that he had been convicted

and sentenced to 17 years of rigorous imprisonment. A copy of the said news item was annexed

to his petition marked P3. Thereafter he got his mother to obtain a certified copy of the High

Court proceedings and filed this revision application.

At the hearing, the learned Deputy Solicitor General (hereinafter referred to as "DSG") appearing

for the complainant raised the following preliminary objections:

(1) The accused is guilty of contumacious conduct and as such is not entitled to invoke

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

(2) The petition filed by the accused is supported by an affidavit submitted by his mother.

The accused is not entitled to maintain this application without an affidavit of the

accused.

(3) No exceptional circumstances have been urged in the petition.

(4) The Petitioner has failed to observe Rule 3(1)(a)(b) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules.

(5) The Petitioner has not challenged the judgment of the High Court on the grounds of it

being illegal, irregular, capricious and arbitrariness.

(6) The application has been filed after undue delay.

Contumacious Conduct

In Sudharman De Silva v. Attorney Genera/1 the Supreme Court held that contumacious conduct

on the part of the applicant is a relevant consideration when the exercise of discretion in his

favour is involved. Our courts have proceeded on the principle that a person who by his

contumacious conduct placed himself beyond the reach of the law treating the original courts

and their authority with contempt should not be allowed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

1 (1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 9

3

the appellate courts, particularly the Court of Appeal. 2 The learned President's Counsel for the

accused relied on the case of Seeralathevan v. Attorney Genera/3 and submitted that a party that

has a right of appeal can file a revision application (even after the appealable period) if he can

explain his delay or any other reason for not filing an appeal provided that there are exceptional

circumstances (such as mistake of law) committed by the trial judge. While I am in agreement

with this formulation, the first objection raised in this application is that a person who by his

contumacious conduct placed himself beyond the reach of the law treating the original courts

and their authority with contempt should not be allowed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the appellate courts, particularly the Court of Appeal. This was not a point considered in

Seeralathevan v. Attorney General.4

The question then is whether the accused is guilty of contumacious conduct. It is admitted that

the accused did not present himself before the High Court for trial. The accused seeks to explain

his absence by reference to the alleged delay in filing proceedings in the High Court and his

attempts to ascertain whether there were any such proceedings. I am not satisfied with his

explanations. On the contrary, as explained below, there is compelling evidence that the accused

was aware of the High Court proceedings and thought it fit to keep away.

The original case record of the High Court of Chi law case No. 164/2005 had been called for by

this court when notice was issued in this application. Journal entry dated 28.11.2005 therein

shows that one Mr. Hillary Fernando, Attorney-at-Law had, on behalf of the accused, applied for

certified copies of the journal entry of 02.11.2005, last journal entry in case No. 50514 as well as

the indictment. Only a certified copy of the journal entry dated 02.11.2005 had been issued as

the Magistrate's Court case record was not available. There is an entry to show that a sum of Rs.

30/= had been charged for this purpose. The said application is set out below:

2 AG v. Podi Singho (51 N.L.R. 385); Opatha Mudiyanselage Nimal Perera v Attorney General [CA (Rev) 532/97, C.A.M. 21.10.98.);Rajapakse v. The State [(2001) 2 Sri.L.R. 161); Senatileke v. Attorney General et al [(1998) 3 Sri.L.R. 290); Wijayarathna v. Attorney General [(2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 407)

That application bears the date stamp 28.11.2005. This clearly establishes that the accused knew

as at that date that proceedings had been instituted against him in the High Court of Chilaw.

Otherwise, his lawyer could not have given the High Court case number in the application. No

lawyer will make such an application without instructions. The accused tried to challenge the

veracity of that application by contending he was out of the country at that time. However, he

has not produced a complete copy of his passport. Only the bio data page and another page

indicating that he had made one trip to Sri Lanka was submitted with the revision application. It

may well be that the lawyer made the said application on instructions received from a person

acting on behalf of the accused. It is interesting to note that the journal entry dated 28.11.2005

was not a part of the certified copy of the High Court record annexed by the accused to his

petition marked as P4. He sought to explain that he produced as P4 a complete copy of the High

Court record that was issued to him. It may well be a coincidence that an important piece of

evidence that cuts across the case of the accused was not a part of the certified copy of the High

Court record issued to him.

The revision application was supported by an affidavit of the mother of the accused. Interestingly,

at paragraph 16 therein, she states that "I further state that since he or I did not receive any

communication/Notice/Summons till the latter part of 2004, about 3 ~ years after his case was

"No Dated", we believed that in fact no further proceedings are to be taken at all against him ... "

Why did she limit her statement to "till the latter part of 2004"? Nowhere in her affidavit does

she deny that neither the accused or she received any communication/notice/summons about

the High Court case after the latter part of 2004. Why didn't she do that?

The necessary conclusion the above facts leads to is that the accused was aware of the indictment

against him but thought it fit to stay away from judicial proceedings. In any event, even if the

explanation of the accused for his absence is considered, still it shows scant regard to judicial

procedure. He did not at least try to obtain permission from the Magistrates Court before

proceeding abroad.

Another significant aspect of this matter is that the accused did not make an application under

section 241(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code to have the conviction and sentence set aside and

to have trial de novo. In Wijayarathna v. Attorney GeneralS Ranjith Silva J. referring to a similar

situation stated:

"This fact indicates that he had no valid reasons or justifiable reasons, for that matter,

any reasons whatsoever to adduce before the High Court, in order to justify his absence.

In other words, the accused by keeping silent and not exercising his rights under section

241 of the Criminal Procedure Code has impliedly admitted that he had no cause to show

and that, he was guilty of contumacious conduct."6

In these circumstances I am of the view that the accused, who by his contumacious conduct

placed himself beyond the reach of the law treating the original courts and their authority with

contempt, should not be allowed to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

There is a further reason why the application of the accused should be dismissed in limine.

Revision is a discretionary remedy. The conduct of a petitioner is a relevant consideration when

he asks for relief by invoking a discretionary remedy such as revision. He must come to court with

clean hands. Revision will be refused where a petitioner is guilty of suppression of material facts?

If there is anything like deception the Court ought not to go in to the merits, but simply say "we

will not listen to your application because of what you have done". 8 The accused has suppressed

material facts and failed to come to court with clean hands. He has tried to mislead this Court.

This application should on this ground alone be dismissed in limine.

The learned President's Counsel for the accused submitted that even where the conduct

attributed to a petitioner is totally reprehensible and cannot be condoned, the Court is justified

in exercising its revisionary powers in order to quash and set aside an order made wholly without

jurisdiction. 9 However, our courts have consistently held that where a party is guilty of

suppression of material facts the court will not go into the merits but dismiss the application in

limine.

In any event, the argument based on section 48 of the Judicature Act is devoid of merit. It was

argued that the learned High Court judge failed to comply with section 48 of the Judicature Act.

The contention is that this section gives the presiding judge a discretion which in this case has

been surrendered to the prosecution. Counsel for the accused relied on the decisions in Attorney

General v. Siriwardane et al1O, Ocean Envoy and another v. AL-Linshirah Bulk Carriers Limitedll,

Dharmaratne v. Dassenaike et a/12 and Ratnayake v. Attorney General. 13

Section 48 of the Judicature Act was considered in Thommeyahakuru Somasiri v. Republic oj Sri

Lanka14 where Sisira De Abrew J. held that:

itA careful reading of the said section suggests that the successor of the previous Judge

has the power to continue with the evidence already recorded before his predecessor.

The accused has the right to demand to resummons the witnesses. Thus, it appears that

the rule is to continue with the evidence already recorded before his predecessor and the

exception is to resummon the witnesses on an application by the accused or in the

opinion of the Court. If the proceedings are to commence afresh in a criminal case, on

each time that a Judge would change his station, the administration of justice in this

country will suffer from an incurable debility resulting in deterioration of public faith in

the judicial system."

The proceedings of 08.12.2014 is as follows:

Here the learned High Court judge has decided to continue with the proceedings and one matter

he took into consideration is the consent of the prosecution. There is no error on the part of the

learned High Court judge. Certainly, it is not a decision made wholly without jurisdiction. In any

case, the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order

of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has

not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

The learned President's Counsel for the accused relied on Premasiri v. Attorney General1s and

submitted that "it is well settled law that in sexual offences the prosecutrix's evidence should be

collaborated be independent evidence to act upon it unless the court is satisfied that her

evidence is so convincing to act upon it without looking for corroboration" and hence court

should exercise revisionary powers even in the circumstances of this case. However, what was

held is that there is no rule that there must be corroboration in every case before a conviction

can be allowed to stand. It is well settled law that a conviction for the offence of rape can be

based on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there is no

infirmity. The learned High Court judge has held that the evidence of the prosecutrix has been

corroborated by her mother and the medical evidence. In these circumstances, I see no merit in

the submissions made by the learned President's Counsel for the accused on this aspect.

In summary, I am of the view that the accused is guilty of contumacious conduct and suppression

of material facts and that the revision application should be dismissed in limine on those two

grounds. In any event, the grounds relied on by the counsel for the accused to assail the merits

of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw is devoid of merit.

In view ofthe findings made above, it is unnecessary to consider the other preliminary objections

raised by the learned DSG. For the foregoing reasons, the application of the accused is dismissed

in limine with costs.

The revision application filed in this court indicates that the accused is living overseas. It appears

that neither the Magistrate's Court or the High Court has informed the Controller of Immigration

and Emigration about the criminal proceedings against the accused. Therefore, learned High

Court Judge of Chilaw is directed to inform the Controller of Immigration and Emigration about

the conviction of the accused with his passport details and take steps according to law to

implement the sentence imposed on the accused.
