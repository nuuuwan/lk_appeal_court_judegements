The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking a mandate

in the nature of writ of Mandamus to compel the 1 st to 3rd Respondents to enforce

the directive contained in document marked P6, to admit the Petitioners daughter

to grade 3 of Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the said school)

The Petitioner submits that by letter dated 3011112015, marked PI, the 3rd

Respondent has informed the Petitioner of his approval to admit the Petitioners

daughter to grade 2 of the said school for the year 2015. In response to the said

letter, the 1 st Respondent has informed the Petitioner by letter dated 03/12/2015,

marked P2, to be present in school with his daughter on 04112/2015, together with

the required documents as specified in the said letter. The Petitioner further

submits that on the said date the Petitioner was advised by the 1 st Respondent to

obtain further approval from the 3rd Respondent to have the child admitted to

grade 3 for the year 2016, to which the 3rd Respondent granted approval by letter

dated 11112/2015, marked P3.

However, the Petitioner states that the 1 st Respondent having observed that

the Petitioners child was a Roman Catholic, had sought for time to get further

approval from the 3rd Respondent to admit the child. The 3rd Respondent having

considered the affidavits and the pre-school certificates marked P5, P5A to P5C,

once more by impugned letter dated 08/02/2016, marked P6, has approved the

Petitioners child to be admitted to the said school.

The documents filed of record does not suggest that the Petitioner at any

time was called for an inquiry regarding his application nor was he informed about

the status of the said application. The Petitioner is challenging the inaction as

stated above, on the part of the Respondents, on the basis of illegality and

legitimate expectation.

The Respondents together with their statement of objections has attached

letter dated 18/0112106, marked R3, written by the 1 st Respondent to the 3rd

Respondent, that the Petitioners child cannot be admitted, since the said school is a

Buddhist Scholl, which has no percentage representing Roman Catholics students.

Similar sentiments have been expressed by the 3rd Respondent to the 1st

Respondent in letter dated 22/02/2016, marked R4, where it is stated that the

school consists of 100% Buddhist children and therefore, the 1 st Respondent is not

required to proceed as requested, by his letter dated 08/02/2016.

The child seeking admission comes from a mixed religious background,

where the father is Roman Catholic and the mother a Buddhist. With the blessings

of her parents, the child is a student and a follower of Buddhism, as observed in

the affidavits and the pre-school certificates filed of record.

In this background, it is interesting to note that the decision refusing to

admit the child taken by the Respondents was not communicated to the Petitioner

nor was the Petitioner afforded the right of hearing of his grievance. It is also

observed that adequate reasons were not given in arriving at the said decision

contained in the letter dated 22/02/2016, marked R4.

In the case of Sundarkaran Vs. Bharathi and others, (1989) ISLR 46,

Amerasinge J. quoted the dicta of Lord Wright in General Medical Council Vs.

Spackman (1963) 2All E R 66 H.L. which stated,

If the principals of natural justice are violated in respect of any decision it is

indeed, immaterial whether the same decision would have been arrived at, in the

absence of the essential principles of justice. The decision must be declared no

decision.

In the case of Bandula Vs. Almeida and others (1995) 1 SLR 309,

Wadugodapitiya J. quoting Lord Denning in Schmidt Vs. Secretary of State for

Home Affairs (1989) 1 All E R 904, stated that,

The Petitioner has a right or interest---- of which it would not be fair to

deprive him without hearing what he may have to say.

In the above case the Court also held that,

The general rule is that a right to a hearing constitutes a minimum pre-

requisite of natural justice.

In the circumstance, I find that the Petitioner has not been afforded a fair

hearing prior to the decision taken by the 3rd Respondent not to admit the child, as

reflected in letter dated 22/02/2016, marked R4, addressed to the 1 st Respondent,

which violates the petitioner's right to a due inquiry.

.. 6

Accordingly, I direct the Respondents to hold an inquiry a fresh, forthwith,

which conforms to the Petitioners right to a fair hearing, and entitled to, under the

princi pals of natural justice.

Therefore, the Petition is partly allowed. There is no order for costs.
