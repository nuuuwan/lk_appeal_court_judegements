The Plaintiff-Appellant (Plaintiff) filed action in the District Court of Matale seeking to partition

the land called Diyabubulewatta Hena described more fully in the schedule to the plaintsituated

atPaliegama in the district of Matale. The land was said to be A.O R.3 P.ll in extent. The

corpusis depicted in plan No. 4904 dated 16.08.1995 made by K.S. Samarasinghe, Licensed

Surveyor (01.3). The Plaintiff claimed that she was entitled to an undivided 7/8 share of the

corpus while the Defendant-Respondent (Defendant) was entitled to an undivided 1/8 share of

the corpus.

This is a rare partition case where there was no contest between the parties, the trial was

concluded in one day and the judgement delivered on the same day. No points of contest were

raised between parties. The evidence of the Plaintiff was lead after which the case for the

Plaintiff was closed. On the same day the learned District Judge of Matale gave judgement and

held that the Plaintiff is entitled to an undivided 2/3 share of the corpus while the Defendant is

entitled an undivided 1/3 share of the corpus. The Plaintiff has appealed against the said

judgement.

It is useful to examine the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff before addressing the arguments

made by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff. It is the claim of the Plaintiff that the original

owners of the corpus were Lokuge Allis De Silva and Lokuge Punchi Nona. Allis De Silva sold his

undivided X share of the corpus to Odiris De Silva by deed no. 10370 dated 1931.11.10 attested

by J.S. Jayawardena, notary public. Upon the death of the said Odiris De Silva, his rights

devolved on Gunawathie De Silva, Sisilia De Silva, David De Silva, Wilson De Silva, Peter De Silva,

Alfred De Silva, Silva Nona and Edward De Silva. The said Wilson De Silva, Peter De Silva, Alfred

De Silva, Silva Nona and Edward De Silva sold their rights to the Plaintiff Gunawathie De Silva by

deed no. 28065 dated 1972.09.20 attested by H.H.S. Seneviratne Notary Public who thereby

became the owner of an undivided 6/8 share of the corpus. Furthermore, David De Silva sold

his undivided 1/8 share of the corpus to the Plaintiff Gunawathie De Silva by deed no. 3947

dated 1990.02.23 attested by L.B. Warnapala notary public who thereby became the owner of

an undivided 7/8 share of the corpus.

According to this pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff she claimed an undivided 7/8 share of the

corpus while the Defendant Sisilia De Silva was said to be entitled to an undivided 1/8 share of

the corpus.

According to the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff the other X share of Diyabubulewatta Hena

held by Lokuge Punchi Nona devolved upon other parties as pleaded in the plaint and was the

subject matter of D.C. Matale case no. 1524/P.

During the evidence of the Plaintiff the final decree of the said D.C. Matale case No. 1524/P was

marked as ol.2. According to this final decree the Plaintiff, Defendant and David De Silva each

obtained an undivided 1/3 share of Lot 1 in plan no. 3496 prepared K.S. Samarasinghe, licensed

surveyor in the said case. It is this Lot 1 which is A.O R.3 P. 11 in extent that is the corpus in this

case and depicted in plan No. 4904 dated 16.08.1995 made by K.S. Samarasinghe, licensed

surveyor (ol.3). By deed no. 3947 dated 1990.02.23 attested by L.H. Warnapala notary public

(olA) David De Silva sold his share to the Plaintiff. It is on this evidence that the learned District

Judge of Matale held that the Plaintiff is entitled to an undivided 2/3 share of the corpus while

the Defendant is entitled an undivided 1/3 share of the corpus.

The main ground upon which the Substituted Plaintiffs-Appellants (Appellants) sought to assail

the judgment of the learned District judge is that he has failed to properly investigate title as

required by law. Section 25(1) of the Partition Law requires the court to examine the title of

each party and hear and receive evidence in support thereof. It has been consistently held that

it is the duty of the Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the

judgement is a judgement in rem.ln Gnanapandithen and another v. Balanayagam and another1

G.P.S. De Silva c.J. explained this duty as follows:

"Mr. Samarasekera cited several decisions which have, over the years, emphasized the

paramount duty cast on the court by the statute itself to investigate title. It is

unnecessary to repeat those decisions here. For present purposes it would be sufficient

to refer to the case of Mather v. Thamotharam Pillai(2) decided as far back as 1903,

where Layard, CJ. stated the principle in the following term: - "Now, the question to be

decided in a partition suit is not merely matters between parties which may be decided

in a civil action; ... The court has not only to decide the matters in which the parties are

in dispute, but to safeguard the interests of others who are not parties to the suit, who

will be bound by a decree for partition ... "Layard, CJ. stressed the importance of the

duty cast on the court to satisfy itself "that the plaintiff has made out a title to the land

sought to be partitioned, and that the parties before the court are those solely entitled

to such land." (emphasis added). "2

The complaint of the Appellants is that although the Plaintiff is entitled to an undivided 7/8

share of the corpus while the Defendant is entitled to an undivided 1/8 share of the corpus, the

learned District Judge failed to properly investigate the title by not awarding the parties the

said shares. However, this allocation of the shares as pleaded by the Plaintiff in the plaint was

without any reference to the final decree in D.C. Matale case No. 1524/P. But clearly the final

decree in D.C. Matale case No. 1524/P gave the Plaintiff, Defendant and David De Silva each an

undivided 1/3 share of Lot 1 in plan no. 3496 prepared K.S. Samarasinghe, licensed surveyor in

the said case which is the corpus in this case. By deed no. 3947 dated 1990.02.23 attested by

1 (1998) 1 SrLL.R. 391

,

L.H. Warnapala notary public (Ol.4) David De Silva sold his share to the Plaintiff. Hence the

learned District Judge of Matale was correct in deciding that the Plaintiff is entitled to an

undivided 2/3 share of the corpus while the Defendant is entitled an undivided 1/3 share of the

corpus.

But the Appellants complains that the share allocation between the aforesaid parties were not

mentioned in the said final decree and that the learned District Judge should have considered

the judgement and interlocutory decree in the said D.C. Matale case No. 1524/P to ascertain

the share allocation between the parties to this case. However, the judgement and

interlocutory decree in the said D.C. Matale case No. 1524/P was not tendered in evidence

during the trial. While it is true that the court has a duty to investigate the title in a partition

case, it can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence

both documentary and oral. Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and

finding the shares in the corpus for them, otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and

expect the court to do their work and their Attorney-at-Law's work for them to get title to

those shares in the corpus. 3The Plaintiff should have marked in evidence all the documents

which according to her were necessary for court to properly investigate title. She must bear the

consequences of her failure to do so.

Instead, the Appellants now seeks to argue that except ol.3 and ol3{'f, none of the other

documents marked ol.l, ol.2 and Ol.4 during the trial were tendered to court at the conclusion

of the trial and that this merits a trial de novo. The learned Counsel for the Appellants relies on

section 114 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code and the decisions in Chandrasena v. Piyasena and

others4and Podiralahamy v. Ran Banda5 which state that it is the duty of the trial judge to direct

parties after trial to tender all documents to court with a list attached before writing the

judgement. However, the two documents referred to by the Appellants as being important for

the investigation of title, namely the judgement and interlocutory decree in the said D.C.

,

Matale case No. 1524/P was not marked in evidence. Hence no difference is made even if all

the marked documents were tendered to court.

In any event, it appears that in terms of an order made by this court on 18th February 2016, the

Substituted pt Defendant Respondent has submitted the missing marked documents to this

court. None of these documents persuades me to conclude that the judgement of the learned

District Judge of Matale is wrong.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned

District Judge of Matale made on 25th February 1997.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
