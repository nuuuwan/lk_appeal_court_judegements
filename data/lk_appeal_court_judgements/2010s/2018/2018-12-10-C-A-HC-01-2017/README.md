ACHALA WENGAPPULI

The 1st to 4th Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

"Accused-Appellants") and the 5th Accused were indicted before the High

Court of Marata for being members of an unlawful assembly, causing

death of Patabendi Maddumage Dhanushka alias Bunty, causing hurt to two

others while being members of the said unlawful assembly and also on the

basis that they shared common intention with others to commit the said

offences.

At the end of the trial that had proceeded without a jury, only the 1st

to 4th Accused-Appellants were convicted by' the High Court for

committing the murder of Patabendi Maddumage Dhanushka alias Bunty and

of causing hurt to Ajith Prasanna Seneviratne (PW1). They were sentenced

to death on the count of murder while a term of two years of

2

imprisonment was imposed by the trial Court on the count of causing hurt.

The 5th Accused was acquitted by the High Court on all counts while the

1st to 4th Accused-Appellants were also acquitted from the count based on

unlawful assembly.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions and sentences, the Accused-

Appellants sought to set them aside on the basis that the trial Court had

failed to evaluate the several infirmities of the prosecution case and

thereby arrived at an erroneous conclusion. They also contended that the

trial Court wrongly considered the individual criminal liability under

Section 32 of the Penal Code and erred in its failure to identify the several

items of circumstances which it considered to reach the conclusion the

Court had finally arrived at.

The prosecution primarily relied on the evidence of Ajith Prasanna

Seneviratne to establish the several counts against the Accused-Appellants,

who presented an eye witness account of the sequence of events that

resulted in the death of the deceased before the trial Court.

According to him, the deceased had a fight over an incident at a

wedding function with a person identified as Channa who was with the 4th

Accused-Appellant. The 4th Accused-Appellant did nothing when Channa

was under attack, but continued to observe the assault on his companion.

After this incident, the witness and the deceased have retired to a nearby

house owned by one Madura and spent the night there. They came to this

house at about 3.30 or 4.00 in the morning and had slept in the front room

of that house. This room had no doors or windows fixed to it, but the

opening for the windows in the walls, were covered with black polythene

3

sheets. The deceased slept in a bed located closer to the entrance to the

room. He had covered himself with a bed sheet as he usually does in going

to sleep. The witness too had lied down in the same room. They slept for

some time.

On the same morning at about 8.25, one Damith came to see them

and they spoke about the person who suffered an eye injury in the

previous day brawl at the function. At that time the witness heard the

noise of the arrival of a group of persons and one of them shouted" qC)j

Q)g ~~~O), o6@@J". When he looked up, he saw the 3rd Accused-

Appellant at the entrance to the room. The deceased made an attempt to

raise his head and the 3rd Accused-Appellant had struck once with what

appears to be an iron" club" on the head of the deceased. With this blow

on his head, the deceased fell as if "G)(3)o) O)l90) 0G3 " . He fell on the

ground lying across the entrance to the room with his torso falling outside

the room. At the same time about 6 others also have entered the room and

attacked them with clubs. The witness estimated that there may have been

about 20 clubs that the intruders have used in the attack. Among this

group of intruders, the witness identified 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants

along with the 5th Accused. The witness claimed that it was the 1st to 3rd

Accused-Appellants who attacked them most. lstAccused-Appellant also

hit the deceased with a club all over his body along with 2nd and 3rd

Accused-Appellants and the witness noted his body moved due to

receiving the blows only(" t:; g(3))6c:l~ oo~G3 ~a6c:l o@g~) a~6a").

During this attack, the witness also saw the 4th Accused-Appellant

outside the room armed with a firearm which he used to provide cover to

the other three Accused-Appellants. The 4th Accused-Appellant then took

4

aim at him and the witness prevented him being shot by hitting the

weapon with a piece of a reeper. Then the attackers have started

assaulting him. The witness made a futile attempt to ward off the attack

using a reeper piece but got hit several times by clubs. He then ran off but

were chased after by the attackers. When the witness fell after the attack,

the attackers left the scene counting him as dead whilst claiming that "he

too is finished". Thereafter the witness was admitted to Matara Hospital.

The Police evidence revealed that the 1st to 3rd Accused-Appellants

have surrendered to them over the death of the deceased and at the time of

his surrender, the 3rd Accused-Appellant was in possession of a sword.

The officer who recorded their statements noted stains like blood on the

blade and few strands of hair stuck to its blade.

When the Police visited the scene, it was observed that the body of

the deceased was lying closer to an entrance to a room and a blood-soaked

bed sheet was also observed lying nearby. The Police party recovered five

clubs in various shapes and sizes from the crime scene, in addition to

several pieces of concrete and granite.

When an officer visited Matara hospital after five days since the

incident to record a statement from the witness Seneviratne, it was revealed

that he had already left the hospital on his own seeking private medical

treatment. It was only on 07.08.2005 his statement was finally recorded.

The Consultant JMO, in his evidence stated that he had observed 44

external injuries on the deceased's body. Of this total of 44 injuries

consisting of 15 abrasions, 16 contusions, 2 lacerations and 2 deep cut

injuries, the expert witness highlighted the deep cut on the neck of the

5

deceased as the necessarily fatal injury. As a result of this injury the carotid

artery, jugular vein, Vegas nerve, thyroid cartilage, 5th cervical vertebra

and underlying neck muscles were cut, resulting death of the deceased

within one or two minutes of receiving the said injury. Be further

expressed an opinion that it is more probable for the deceased to receive

this injury when he was lying down or sleeping position. The other deep

cut injury that was observed by the expert witness is located on the back of

the right leg extending to underlying muscles. He also expressed opinion

that these injuries could have been caused using the sword, marked as P3,

that had been taken charge by the Police when the 2ndAccused-Appellant

surrendered with it.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the Accused-

Appellants submitted in support of their first ground of appeal that the

trial Court had failed to consider the following infirmities of the

prosecution case:-

a. the only witness to the incident claimed the deceased was

attacked with clubs, but he had died due to severe cut

injury on his neck which is not explained,

b. the prosecution has failed to call the other witnesses who

claimed to have seen the attack, owing to the "unrealistic

nature of the incident" of not seeing any cutting weapon

by the sole witness,

6

c. reliability of the evidence of the sole witness is doubtful

owing to his improbable claim of staying at the scene when

such an attack is taking place,

d. reliability of the evidence of the sole witness is tainted as

he made his statement to Police only after a lapse of two

weeks since the incident.

It is seen that basically the first ground of appeal of the Accused-

Appellants revolve around the issue of testimonial trustworthiness of the

solitary witness to the incident and failure to call witnesses in support of

his evidence.

Understandably, the most significant attack on the credibility of this

sole witness was mounted on his claim of the "club" attack on the

deceased whereas the death of the deceased was due to a serious cut injury

on the neck. There is no evidence before the trial Court as to the infliction

of the said fatal injury and as such, the learned President's Counsel

contended, a question arises whether the witness in fact saw the attack on

the deceased or not.

Upon perusal of the evidence of witness Seneviratne, it became

apparent that his evidence consistently referred to an attack using" clubs"

and there was no reference to any cutting weapon in the possession of any

of the attackers except for a pointed weapon possessed by the 2nd

Accused-Appellant. However, as the learned Senior State Counsel pointed

out that the trial Court accepted his evidence as truthful and reliable, upon

the conclusion that what the witness referred to as a club is in fact a sword

and it was probably due to his faulty observation he had referred it to as a

7

club instead of a sword. In coming to this conclusion, the trial Court was

mindful of the limited opportunity the witness had to absorb the finer

details of this surprise attack by the Accused-Appellants.

Having considered the evidence that had been led before the trial

Court, we are of the view that the said reasoning of the trial Court is

justified under the circumstances. The reasons for our conclusion are given

below.

The witness and the deceased had gone to sleep about five hours

before the incident and just been woken up due to the arrival of Damith

who brought news about the injured who was admitted to hospital few

hours ago, after the brawl at the function. The room the witness was in

covered with black polythene limiting the available light inside it. The

attackers have entered through the opening to a door frame and the

witness observed them against the light coming from that direction.

It is emphatically stated by the witness after the initial attack on the

"head" with a "club" the deceased fell like a log and since then did not

make any movement of his body, except the ones caused by the blows he

received. Witness also described the" club" as an iron rod or a kitul club,

upon its dark appearance. He also admitted that "CJ!:S)C) @\o)~~d t5CJ)

&~e30)t) t5CJ~.!'l) ~lr5)z".

According to witness the deceased did not have any voluntary

movement after the initial attack. The medical evidence in relation to the

neck injury supports such a claim as the death would have occurred

almost instantaneously upon receiving such an attack. The PMR shows

that the deceased had another cut injury on the back of his head. But the

8

witness claimed that the deceased tried to raise his head as he was lying on

the bed when he was hit by the" club". This statement of the witness is

well supported by the medical expert when he said in evidence that it is

more probable that the cut injury on the neck could have be.en inflicted

when he was on a horizontal position rather than vertical. The body of the

deceased did not shift after the initial attack with a "club" as the witness

claimed when he left the house and the Police found it lying across the

entrance to the room, when they arrived at the scene after some hours.

The only cut injury on the head of the deceased was observed on the

back side. The witness did not see any attack, prior to the "clubbing,"

from behind the deceased, supporting the trial Court's conclusion that it

may have been inflicted after the initial attack on the neck. Therefore, the

attack on the "head" by a "club" as perceived by the witness was clearly a

faulty observation by the witness. The attack only lasted five minutes and

with several attackers clubbing the deceased. Therefore, an attack on the

neck by a sword, although seen by the witness as a "club" is in fact the

attack which resulted in the death of the deceased as concluded by the trial

Court.

The other challenge that was mounted on the credibility of the

witness Seneviratne is the application of the test of spontaneity in

evaluating his evidence. Admittedly the witness made a statement to the

Police only after a lapse of a period of two weeks since the incident.

The trial Court had applied the test of spontaneity on the evidence

of the witness. In accepting his evidence as truthful and reliable, it had

accepted the explanation offered by the prosecution for the delay in

9

making the statement to Police by the witness. The witness said that after

his admission to Matara Hospital, he had entertained apprehensions about

his security and therefore he decided to get his head injury treated at a

private hospital in Colombo. Only after receiving medical treatment and

returning to his village he made a statement to Police. During his cross

examination, the witness was suggested that his concerns on the security

had no valid basis but these suggestions were refuted by him. In fact the

Court record indicates that he did not present before the trial Court since

its 1st date of trial in November 2011 until the commencement of the trial in

September 2015, despite the fact that a warrant had been issued again him.

He was represented by an Attorney-at-law who informed Court of the

reluctance of the witness to be present in Court due to threats to his life.

The witness had stated so in his evidence before the trial Court. Having

considered the evidence on this aspect, the trial Court had accepted the

explanation for the belated complaint. We see no reason to interfere with

the conclusion reached by the trial Court on the acceptance of the

explanation for the delay in making the statement.

Whether the conduct of the witness during the attack is probable or

not had also been considered by the trial Court. The trial Court had

considered this aspect of the evidence at length in its judgment citing the

portions of evidence of the witness in the light of the principles of

evaluation of evidence as laid down by judicial precedents. Having

examined the evidence and the reasoning of the trial Court as to whether

its decision to accept the probability of the version given by the witness is

justified, we are of the view that the trial Court had reached the correct

conclusion. The complaint by the Accused-Appellants on the probability of

10

a "club" was used in the initial attack and he is a truthful and reliable

witness whose evidence is well supported by the medical evidence. In

addition, the trial Court has had the distinct advantage of observing the

demeanour and deportment of the witness and in fact the,. Court had

relied upon it, when accepting his evidence as truthful and reliable. As an

appellate Court, we are of the view that the opinion of the trial Judge

based on the demeanour of the witness in assessing his credibility and

reliability is entitled to great weight.

The other ground of appeal is in relation to the imposition of

criminal liability upon the basis of Section 32 of the Penal Code. The trial

Court had considered individual liability of the Accused-Appellants

against their conduct as described by the witness to the incident. The trial

Court considered the fact that the Accused-Appellants have arrived at the

crime scene together having armed themselves and contributed to the

assault on the deceased in varying degrees. The initial exclamation "i@

~~<!'DC)" is an obvious reference to the deceased and that statement was not

contested. This exclamation is a clear indication as to the state of mind of

the Accused-Appellants when they stormed into the house where the

deceased slept. The parting comment" em) ~c)68" supports the inference

that the attackers have achieved their objective. In between these two

points, there were clear evidence as to the roles played by each of the four

Accused-Appellants. Thus, the trial Court had correctly concluded that

the Accused-Appellants were actuated by a common murderous intention

shared by all when they attacked the deceased. The reasoning of the trial

12

Court is evident in this regard when it decided to acquit the 5th Accused as

she was merely present at the scene.

However, the trial Court had considered the case against the

Accused-Appellants as a case founded upon items of circumstantial

evidence. This aspect brings us to the consideration of the third ground of

appeal as presented by the learned President's Counsel. It is his contention

that this being a case of circumstantial evidence, the trial Court had failed

to itemise each of the circumstances that it relied on to find the Accused-

Appellants guilty of the offence of murder. This complaint is apparently

based on the pronouncement of this Court in Kusumadasa vs. State (2011)

Sri L.R.240.

It is correct that the trial Court did not itemise each of the

circumstances it considered in coming to the conclusion that the Accused-

Appellants are guilty of murder in point form. However it had direct

evidence in relation to the other count in the form of evidence of the

injured himself.

But it is also correct that the trial Court did analyse and consider

each of these items of circumstantial evidence in each of the segments in

which the evidence presented before Court is considered for credibility

and sufficiency in proving the charges.

13

Considering the totality of the evidence presented by the

prosecution and the reasoning of the said Court in arriving at the

conclusion that the Accused-Appellants are guilty to the count of murder

and to the count of causing hurt, we are of the considered view that there

is no basis for this Court to interfere with the conclusion reached by the

trial Court.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence of the trial Court is

affirmed and the appeal of the Accused- Appellants is therefore stands

dismissed.
