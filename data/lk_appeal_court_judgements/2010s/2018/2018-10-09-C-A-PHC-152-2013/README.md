This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Central Province

holden in Kandy dated 08.10.2013.

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) instituted proceedings under section

66(1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act) on 15.09.2009 and claimed that the pt

Respondent - Petitioner - Appe"ant (Appe"ant), his wife, the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent, (2nd Respondent) and three children, the 3rd to the 5th Respondents-Respondents-

Respondents (3rd to 5th Respondents) had initially disturbed his possession by breaking the wall

that separated the two portions of the building that the parties were occupying separately and

causing damage to his part of the building.

Page 2 of 10

The Respondent made a police complaint dated 24.07.2009 and claimed that he was later

forcibly dispossessed from the part of the building he was occupying. The Respondent stated

that the Appellant and the 2nd to the 5th Respondents had broken the locks of the part of the

building he was living in, fixed new locks from the inside and prevented the Respondent from

entering his part of the building on 22.07.2009.

The Appellant and the 2nd to the 5th Respondents took up the position that the entirety of the

land described in the schedule to their affidavit was at all times in their possession and that the

Respondent did not enjoy possession to any part of that land or the building on it.

After inquiry the learned Primary Court judge concluded that the Respondent had been in

possession of Lot 1, Lot 7 and the part of the building on Lot 7 as depicted in Plan No 1500 made

by M.S.K.B Mawalagedara Licensed Surveyor and that the Appellant and the 2nd to 5th

Respondents had forcibly dispossessed him from the same two months before the filing of

information in the Primary Court. Accordingly, the learned Primary Court judge made an order

directing that the Respondent be restored to possession and prohibiting all acts which could

disturb the Respondent's possession.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant filed a revision application before the Provincial

High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy and sought to set aside the order of the

learned Magistrate of Kandy. The learned High Court judge refused the application and hence

this appeal.

The Appellant in his revision application (vide page 11 of the Appeal Brief) and written

submissions filed before the learned High Court judge of Kandy (vide page 73 of the Appeal

Brief) sought to assail the order of the learned Primary Court judge on the following grounds:

(i) That the learned Primary Court judge has erred in law by entertaining the information

filed by the Respondent as it asks for reliefs that the Primary Court is not in law

competent to grant namely a declaration to the effect that the Respondent is entitled

to the ownership of Lot 1, Lot 7 and the part of the building on Lot 7.

Page 3 of 10

(ii) That the learned Primary Court judge has erred in law by inquiring into the matter

without considering the fact that the action had been instituted by way of petition and

affidavit instead of the procedure stipulated by law namely file information by way of

affidavit

It is trite law that an objection to the jurisdiction of a court must be raised by a party at the first

available opportunity (Section 39 of the Judicature Act). This principle has been followed by our

courts in the context of proceedings before Primary Courts as well [Navaratnasingham v

Arumugam (1980) 2 Sri. L. R. 1, Paramasothy v Nagalingam (1980) 2 Sr.i L. R. 34]. However, our

courts have also recognized a distinction between cases where there is a patent want of

jurisdiction and latent want of jurisdiction. [Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd v T. W Roberts 56 N.L.R. 293,

Beatrice Perera v The Commissioner of National Housing 77 N.L.R. 361, Colombo Apothecaries

Ltd and others v Commissioner of Labour (1998) 3 Sri. L.R. 320].

In the former type of cases, a waiver of an objection or acquiescence on the part of a party in

raising an objection in the first instance does not give jurisdiction to court to try the matter

[Colombo Apothecaries Ltd and others v Commissioner of Labour (supra)]. Consequently, if a

court labours under a patent want of jurisdiction, any objection to the assumption of such

jurisdiction cab be raised before a higher court (either in Appeal or Revision), even if the party

raising that objection has failed to do so in the first instance. [Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd v T. W

Roberts (supra)]. It is therefore necessary to assess whether the objections raised by the

Appellants for the first time at the revision stage are objections impugning a patent lack of

jurisdiction on the part of the Primary Court. The learned High Court judge would have been

under a legal duty to take cognizance of one or more of these objections only if they showed

that the Primary Court laboured under a patent lack of jurisdiction.

Patent v Latent Want of Jurisdiction

In Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd v T. W Roberts (supra) Sansoni J, quoted with approval the following

passage from Spencer Bower on Estoppel by Representation (1923) at page 187:

"Where it is merely a question of irregularity of procedure, or of a defect in ' contingent'

jurisdiction, or non-compliance with statutory conditions precedent to the validity of

a step in the litigation, of such a character that, if one of the parties be allowed to waive,

or by conduct or inaction to estop himself from setting up, such irregularity or want of'

contingent' jurisdiction or non-compliance, no new jurisdiction is thereby impliedly

created, and no existing jurisdiction is thereby impliedly extended beyond its existing

boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained, and the affirmative answer of illegality

will fail, for, the Royal prerogative not being invaded, and the State therefore not being

injured, nor any of His Majesty's subjects for whom that Royal prerogative is held in trust,

there is no ground of public policy, or other just cause, why the litigant, to whom alone

in that case the statutory benefit belongs, should not be left free to surrender it at

pleasure, or why having be surrendered it, whether by contract, or by conduct or inaction

implying consent, he should be afterwards permitted to claim it. Accordingly, in all cases

of the first class, that is, of defectus jurisdictionis the representor has been held incapable

of estopping himself from resisting the usurped authority; whereas in all those of the

other class that is of mere defectus triationis the affirmative answer has been rejected,

and the representor has been held estopped from objecting to the irregularity"

The above passage suggests that the fundamental feature of a patent lack of jurisdiction is one

where a court lacks jurisdiction over a particular action, cause, proceeding or the parties. The

exercise of powers by a court in a situation of patent want of jurisdiction results in the court

exercising new jurisdictions not provided for by statute.

Page 5 of 10

In Beatrice Perera v The Commissioner of National Housing (supra) the court made the following

observation:

"Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over

the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure

to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power

by the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly

known in the law as a ' patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis

and the second a ' latent' or ' contingent' want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis."

Accordingly, the filing of a petition and affidavit (instead of only an affidavit as required by law)

which included a single prayer of relief that the Primary Court was not competent to consider,

is more easily describable as;

.... a question of irregularity of procedure, or of a defect in ' contingent' jurisdiction, or

non-compliance with statutory conditions precedent to the validity of a step in the

litigation. [Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd v T. W Roberts (supra)] or

... failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise

of power by the Court. [Beatrice Perera v The Commissioner of National Housing (supra)]

Given that a Primary Court judge, subject to what I discussed below under Grant of relief not

prayed for in the affidavit, is not bound to grant reliefs prayed for in an information filed under

section 66(1)(b) of the Act, the mere inclusion of a defective prayer in the information filed will

not result in a Primary Court exercising a wholly new jurisdiction.

A Primary Court will labour under a patent lack of jurisdiction if - for example - one of the thirty-

six different types of actions specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Judicature Act is instituted

in a Primary Court. If a section 66 application which does not comply with the requisite statutory

procedure is instituted and continued before a Primary Court it will have to be regarded as a

situation of latent want of jurisdiction. This is because the Primary Court continues to have

Page 6 of 10

jurisdiction over the subject matter of the application despite the procedural defects in making

that application. [Navaratnasingham v Arumugam (1980) 2 Sri LR 1 at 6].

Where a latent lack of jurisdiction exists, a party must raise these procedural defects at the

earliest opportunity as acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of the party will estop that

party from raising the objections in later proceedings.

A perusal of the available record of Case No 20562, shows that the Appellant has failed to raise

the aforementioned objections in his affidavit filed on 2009.11.10 (Vide page 246 - 248 of the

Appeal Brief) and subsequently in the written submissions filed on 2009.12.21 (Vide pages 178

- 179 of the Appeal Brief). Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the learned High Court judge

was correct in disregarding the objections raised by the Appellant for the first time in his

revision application filed before the High Court. The acquiescence on the part of the Appellant

in raising the objections has cured the latent want of jurisdiction that existed before the Primary

Court of Kandy.

Grant of relief not prayed for in the affidavit

The next question is whether the Primary Court judge could have granted reliefs that have not

been prayed for in the affidavit. The Appellants have raised this point for the first time in their

written submissions filed before this court and rely on Weragama v Bandara (77 N.L.R. 28) and

Buddhadasa Kaluarachchi v Nilamanie Wijewickrema and another [(1990) 1 Sri.L.R. 262] to

demonstrate that a court is not entitled to grant relief that has not been prayed for by a party.

This principle has undoubtedly received widespread judicial recognition in the context of

proceedings held under the Civil Procedure Code. The apex courts have consistently held that a

District Court is not entitled to grant reliefs to a party if the relief is not prayed for in the prayer

to the plaint. [Sirinivasa Thera v Sudassi Thera (63 N.L.R. 31), Wijesuriya v Senaratna (1997) 2

Sri. L.R. 323, Surangi v Rodrigo (2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 35]

Page 7 of 10

The aforementioned principle has also recently been adopted in the context of Primary Court

proceedings. In Dias and another v. Dias and another [CA (Rev) Application No: 63/2016; CAM.

12.08.2016] a divisional bench of this court observed as follows:

"We find that the Learned Magistrate has erred in ordering that the respondents be

restored to possession when there is no such prayer in the petition by the respondents.

The respondents had not prayed for restoration of possession this is a private

information under Section 66(l)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in terms of

Section 66(l)(b) the petitioner has to set out the relief sought."

I will now consider whether the said decision sets out the correct position of law on the question

now before us.

Sections 68(1) and (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act) reads:

1/(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall

be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine

as to who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of the-

information under section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to possession

of such land or part thereof.

(2) An order under subsection (1) shall declare anyone or more persons therein

specified to be entitled to the possession of the land or the part in the manner

specified in such order until such person or persons are evicted therefrom under

an order or decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of such an order or decree."

(Emphasis added)

Page 8 of 10

These provisions clearly impose a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and

declare the persons entitled to possession of the land. They apply to applications made under

section 66(1){a) as well as under section 66(1){b) of the Act. There is of course no prayer for

relief in an application made under section 66(1){a) of the Act but yet the Primary Court Judge

has a statutory duty to determine and declare the persons entitled to possession of the land. In

this situation one cannot argue that the general principle is that a court is not entitled to grant

relief that has not been prayed for by a party.

Similarly, I am of the view that even in applications made under section 66(1)(b) of the Act there

is a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and declare the persons entitled to

possession of the land. This has been done by the learned Primary Court Judge in the instant

case. The fact that the Appellant has failed to pray for this relief in the affidavit does not relieve

the learned Primary Court Judge of the statutory duty imposed on him.

For the foregoing reasons, with the greatest respect to their lordships in Dias and another v.

Dias and another (supra), I hold that in a private information under Section 66(1){b) of the Act

it is not incumbent on the petitioner to specifically pray for restoration to possession. That is a

relief that the learned Primary Court Judge is under a statutory duty to consider and grant after

due inquiry.

In any event, the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree

or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

In Sunil Jayarathna v Attorney General (2011) 2 Sri LR 91, the Supreme Court in applying the

proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution observed that:

"Unless there is some grave miscarriage of justice it would not be appropriate to

interfere with the judgment of the trial judge who enters judgment after careful

consideration of the first-hand evidence put before her to which the Judges of the

Appellate Court would not have the ability to witness."

Page 9 of 10

In the matter before us, the defect in the prayer of the Respondent's affidavit does not at any

point prejudice the substantial rights of the Appellant or occasion a failure of justice. Despite

prayer (b) to the affidavit seeking a declaration to the effect that the Respondent is entitled to

the ownership of Lot 1, Lot 7 and the part of the building on Lot 7, the Primary Court judge has

carefully limited himself to assessing the question of possession in terms of section 68(3) of the

Act.

The learned Primary Court judge has initially made a determination that the Respondent had

been dispossessed from his part of the land and the building within two months prior to the

filing of information. The learned Primary Court judge has thereafter made an order directing

that the Respondent be restored to possession of the part of the land/building and has also

prohibited all interference/disturbance of such possession (Vide pages 194 -195 of the Appeal

Brief). Thus, it is clear that the learned Primary Court judge has disregarded the defective and

irregular prayer in the affidavit and made an order that is strictly in accordance with section

68(3) of the Act.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Central Province holden in Kandy dated 08.10.2013.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
