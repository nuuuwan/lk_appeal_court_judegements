Counsel for the Accused -appellant informs court that he has been

assigned by this court and he has very carefully perused the evidence

and the dock statement made by the accused and also the judgment of the

leaned trial Judge dated 31.07.2012 in order to ascertain whether there

are any infirmities or procedurals illegalities in the instant case. He also

informs, upon the perusal of the entirety of the case record he is of the

view that there are no compelling grounds to challenge the conviction and

the sentence in this case.

The learned ASG informs court that the prosecution led the

evidence of witness No: 1 Komaran Saraswathi who was the mother of

the two deceased who were 1 Y2 years and 3 Y2 years of age at the time of

the incident. The witness herself was first stabbed by the accused

according to the testimony of witness Komaran Saraswathi. The medical

evidence led at the trial to support the direct testimony of the witness.

The evidence of witness Saraswathi was not found to have had any

contradictions or omissions. Therefore the testimonial creditworthiness

of the witness was not the matter before the learned trial judge at the

trial. When the accused was called upon for his defence at the close of

the prosecution case the accused made a statement from the dock. He

admitted his presence inside the house where the incident took place on

the date of the incident but he sought to impute liability on an unknown

intruder. However this position was not taken up in the close of the

cross examination of the accused at the trial. The evidence adduced in the

close of the cross examination was in fact to the contrary admitting the

presence of the accused armed with a knife.

The learned High Court Judge having considered this evidence had

been very considerate on each and every item of evidence, and he

accordingly found the accused guilty of Count No. 1. He found the accused

guilty for lesser offence of attempted murder under Section 300 of the

Penal Code in respect of count No: 2. The learned High Court Judge

proceeded to acquit the accused of count No:3 which pertain to section

315 of the Penal Code.

In opposing of appeal learned DSG submits that the evidence was

overwhelming to support the conviction by the learned trial Judge where

does not appear to be any reason by the legal or factual to reverse the

findings of the learned trial Judge. In the circumstances with regard to

the evidence of this case and conclusion of the learned trial judge, to

affirm the conviction and uphold the sentence imposed on the accused

appellant.

After perusal of the evidence and considering the submissions made

by both parties we decide to affirm the judgment dated 31.07.2012 by the

learned High Court Judge of Rathnapura.

Appeal is dismissed.
