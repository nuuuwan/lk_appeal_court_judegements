ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st and 2nd accused-appellants were indicted before the High

Court of Matara for causing death of Korale Hewage Nimal, under Sections

140,296 read with 146 and 296, read with 32 of the Penal Code, with three

other accused. After trial without a jury, only the 1st and 2nd accused-

appellants were convicted. They were sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused-

appellants sought to have the said conviction and sentence of death set

aside upon the following grounds of appeal;

1. the trial Court has erroneously accepted the evidence of the sole eye witness, notwithstanding its infirmities,

11. the learned High Court Judge who convicted them had no power since there was no nomination made in his name.

However, at the hearing, learned Counsel for the accused-appellants

moved this Court to have this case remitted back to High Court for a trial

de novo in view of the two grounds of appeal.

The prosecution relied on the sole eye witness to the incident

Nilanthi to prove the several charges levelled against the five accused.

According to witness Nilanthi the deceased was her elder brother. He was

not married at that time and lived in their ancestral house. On the day of

the incident, she has gone to her ancestral house to pick her children. On

2

her way, she saw her brother also walking towards their house about 50

meters ahead of her. Then she saw the 1st accused-appellant suddenly

emerging behind a fence of Makulatha trees. He had a sword in his hand

and has then attacked the deceased's neck area with it. With the sword

attack the deceased fell into the side drain. The 2nd accused-appellant too

has come armed with a "Malu Pihiya" and attacked the already fallen

deceased with it. Seeing this attack on her brother, the witness raised cries.

When her sister and a nephew came to see what was happening, the two

accused-appellants have chased after them.

The witness went near the deceased who seemed to be alive at that

time. Then the two accused-appellants have returned to the scene and has

thereafter chased the witness away. The other accused who came to the

scene after the attack on the deceased, encouraged the accused-appellants

to inflict more injuries on him.

By then many others have gathered around the place and the

accused-appellants decided to withdraw. Since the deceased has died by

that time, the witness had taken a detour to avoid the accused-appellant's

house, to reach the Police Station and lodged a complaint.

During her lengthy cross examination, several contradictions and

omissions were marked. It is based on these infirmities that the accused-

appellants complain that the sole eye witness's evidence is of diminished

3

evidentiary value. They complain that the infirmities in relation to identity

of the accused, the improbability of her narration of sequence of events,

taken together with the strong motive to implicate them to the incident

should have been considered by the trial Court to decide that she is not a

truthful and reliable witness.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant, during his submissions

introduced another aspect in relation to the first ground of appeal, in

addition to the already stated ground that the trial Court has erroneously

accepted the evidence of the sole eye witness, notwithstanding its

infirmities. The new aspect, relied on by the accused-appellant in support

of their first ground of appeal, is that the learned High Court Judge who

delivered the judgment has adopted the evidence already led before his

predecessors and thereby failed to recall the witnesses as provided for by

Section 48 of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 as amended.

Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment, has taken extra care to

evaluate Nilanthi's credibility as he was very much alive to the fact that he

had no opportunity of observing her demeanour and deportment when

giving evidence. In the judgment itself there were references that no

opportunity to observe her demeanour. Learned High Court Judge has

devoted a separate section for evaluation of credibility of the sole eye

witness and dealt with each contradiction and omission. He has applied

the tests of spontaneity, consistency and probability on her evidence before

accepting her testimony as truthful and reliable. There was criticism by the

4

accused-appellant upon the learned High Court Judge's comment that the

witness was tired after lengthy and often repeated questioning during

cross examination. The contention of the accused-appellant is that the trial

Judge was not able to make that observation as he did not observe the

demeanour of the witness.

This observation was made by the trial Judge not on the demeanour

of the witness but on the material available on the record itself. Her

evidence commenced on 2nd October 2012 after 16 years since the incident

and continued for several hours on that day. After an adjournment for a

date after 7 months, her evidence continued on 2nd May 2013 and that also

for several hours. There was cross examination of the witness even on

minute details by the accused. It is under these circumstances the trial

Judge rightly considered the stress of the witness and its effect on her

evidence in the evaluation.

There cannot be a difficulty in relation to identifying the accused-

appellants in this day time incident, where the witness has seen two well-

known persons attacking her brother within a distance of 50 meters. Her

reference to describe the initial identity in vague terms led to this

submission. Thereafter, the witness has clearly identified the two accused-

appellants, when they chased after her sister and threatened her.

5

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellants relied on the admission

of the witness Nilanthi that there was previous enmity existed between the

accused-appellants and the deceased, which made her to implicate them

falsely for the murder of her brother. The learned trial Judge has devoted

considerable space in his judgment in consideration of this factor, before

he decided to accept her evidence.

The determination on credibility of a witness is a determination of a

question of fact and we see no reason to interfere with this finding of fact

by the learned trial Judge.

The other complaint by the accused-appellants, is that the trial Judge

should have exercised his discretion under Section 48 of the Judicature Act

No.2 of 1978 as amended, should be considered next.

Section 48 provided for a situation where continuation of

proceedings before a succeeding Judge who was empowered to act on the

already recorded evidence. In addition, the succeeding Judge was also

empowered to "re summon the witnesses and commence proceedings

afresh."

The amendment brought in to the proviso to Section 48 of the

Judicature Act by the Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 27 of 1999, read as

follows; 6

"Provided that where any criminal prosecution,

proceeding or matter (except on an mqUIry

preliminary to the committal for trial) is continued

before the successor of any such judge, the accused

may demand that the witnesses be re summoned

and reheard."

Before this amendment, the proviso stated that "either party may

demand that the witnesses be re-summoned and re-heard, in which case

the trial shall commence afresh."

In view of these provisions, it appears that the accused-appellant's

submission that the trial Judge has failed to exercise his discretion to re

summon Nilanthi is based on the power conferred upon a succeeding trial

Judge to lire summon the witnesses and commence proceedings afresh."

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his submissions in reply,

contended that with the amendment brought in by the Act No. 27 of 1999,

only the accused could demand that a witness be recalled and the

prosecution was deprived of that opportunity. He further submitted that if

the accused-appellants were of the view that the trial Judge should have

observed the demeanour and deportment of the witness, then they had

ample opportunity to make an application to the succeeding trial Judge to

recall her. Having failed to make an application at the proper stage,

7

..

learned Deputy Solicitor General strongly contended that it is too late in

the day to make this complaint only in the appeal.

In Dissanayake and Others v Dhannaratne(2008) 2 Sri L.R. 184, the

Supreme Court observed thus;

"It is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue

proceedings since there are changes of Judges holding

office in a particular Court due to transfers, promotions

and the like. It is in these circumstances that Section 48

was amended giving a discretion to a Judge to continue

with the proceedings. Hence the exercise of such discretion

should not be disturbed unless there are serious issues

with regard to the demeanour of any witness recorded by

the Judge who previously heard the case."

As correctly submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the

accused-appellants did not make any application to the succeeding trial

Judge to recall Nilanthi. If they were under the impression that she has

fared poorly at the witness box during the predecessor trial Judge and it is

advantageous for them to have the witness recalled, then they had all the

opportunity to do so as there was no change of their Counsel.

When the succeeding trial Judge decided to adopt proceedings under

Section 48 on 27th August 2014, all parties consented. Then the question to

8

..

be decided in respect of this submission would be whether the succeeding

trial Judge has exercised his discretion under Section 48 reasonably.

The apex Court, in its observation took a pragmatic view by

narrowing down the scope of the challenges that could be made to

instances of such exercise of discretion as it held that "the exercise of such

discretion should not be disturbed unless there are serious issues with regard to the

demeanour of any witness recorded by the Judge who previously heard the case. /I

If there is a serious issue, then the best party to raise it is the accused-

appellants themselves. If the succeeding trial Judge, having considered the

evidence already led, decided to proceed with the case with the consent of

the parties then that clearly is a reasonable exercise of discretion.

In Dharmaratne v Dassenaike and Others (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 130, this

Court reproduced the judgment of Wijewardena v Lenora 60 NLR 457

where the considerations that should be applied by an appellate Court in

determining the issue whether a Judge of a Court of first instance has

exercised the discretion vested in him reasonably;

"The mode of approach of an Appellate Court to an appeal

against an exercise of discretion is regulated by well-established

principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the

appellate Court consider that, if they had been in the position of

9

...

the trial Judge, they would have taken a different course. It

must appear that some error has been made in exercising the

discretion. It must appear that the judge has acted illegally,

arbitrarily or upon a wrong principle of law or allow

extraneous or irrelevant consideration to guide or affect him, or

that he has mistaken the facts, or not taken into account some

material consideration. Then only can his determination be

reviewed by the appellate Court. "

In view of the above reasoning, we are of the firm view that the first

ground of appeal raised by the accused-appellants is without any merit.

The second ground of appeal concerns the issue whether the

succeeding trial Judge had the authority to try and determine the case

against the accused-appellants.

The submission made by the learned Counsel for the accused-

appellants are based on a nomination made by His Lordship the Chief

Justice on 4th July 2006 nominating a particular Judge of the High Court of

Hambantota to hear and conclude the case at Hambantota whose name

appears on the nomination and therefore the judgment pronounced by a

different High Court Judge at Matara is made clearly without authority.

10

,"

..

However, the examination of the original case record revealed that

there is a subsequent nomination dated 24th November 2011, by which the

"Present Judge of the High Court of Matara is directed to hear and

conclude" this case. It is clear that the learned High Court Judge who

finally delivered the judgment was empowered by this nomination as he

was the incumbent High Court Judge of Matara at that time. Therefore, the

submission made by Counsel for the accused-appellants in relation to the

2nd ground of appeal is based clearly on a misconceived notion.

Upon consideration of the two grounds of appeal, we hold that they

are without any merit. Accordingly, the judgment and the sentence

imposed on the accused-appellants by the High Court of Matara on 11th

July 2016 is affirmed.

The appeal of the accused-appellants IS therefore stands

dismissed.
