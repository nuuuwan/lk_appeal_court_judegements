BEFORE: E.A.G.R. Amarasekara J.

DECIDED ON:08.06.2018

This leave to appeal application dated 10.10.2005 was filed by the Defendant

Petitioners (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendants) challenging the

order dated 23.09.2005 marked P11 of the learned District Judge of Colombo. As

per the Journal Entry dated 08.05.07 parties have agreed to file written

submissions with regard to leave as well as the main matter. Unfortunately, this

case has gone down without making any order for many years for various

reasons.

The factual background to this application indicates that during the cross

examination of the Plaintiff in defamatory action No. 27667 in the District Court

of Colombo, the Defendants moved by way of a motion marked P7 to show a VCD

and its contents to the Plaintiff and cross examine the Plaintiff. Furthermore, the

Defendant had alternatively moved under Section 7 of the Evidence (Special

3

Provisions) Act No.14 of 1995 (Vide P7). The Plaintiff had filed his written

objections marked P8 to this application on 02.05.2005 before the learned District

Judge.

The Plaintiff's main objections were as follows;

1. There were no provisions to make this application,

2. The Defendant wasguilty for laches in making the application,

~ 3. The Defendant could have properly listed the VCD to produce it in

evidence.

4. The Plaintiff had clearly denied that he is there in that VCD.

The learned District Judge delivered his order dated 23.09.2005 marked P11

refusing the application of the Defendant on the ground that the Defendant

hadfailed to give 45 days' notice as per the section 7(1)(a) of the Evidence (Special ,.. Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995. The learned District Judge has also referred to

section 2 of the same Act which reads as follows;

"Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the Evidence Ordinance

or any other written law the provisions of this act shall be applicable in respect of

any matter provided here in."

The aforesaid section only applies to the matters provided in Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 and when they are contrary to the provisions in

other Laws but not for Casus Omisus or to situations which are not contrary.

This court is aware of the decision made in Abeygunawardana V Samoon and

others (2007) 1 Sri L.R 276 which stated that after the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act 14 of 1995 came into operation admission of video Recordings is

governed solely under the provisions of the said act. Section 7(2) of the said act

states that a party shall not be permitted to tender computer evidence or

contemporaneous recordings in evidence if they fail to give notice as provided in

section 7(1) of the said Act but One has to adduce evidence only to prove a

4

fact.Section 7 applies only when one wants to tender evidence. What is admitted

need not be proved. Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that facts

admitted at the hearing or before the hearing by any writing or by any rule of

pleading need not be proved unless the court in its discretion require that to be

proved otherwise. Even the Section 8(1) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act

No. 14 of 1995 states as follows;

1/8(1)ln any proceeding it shall not be necessary for any party to tender any

evidence of any fact which is admitted by the opposing part."

This shows that even under Evidence (Special provisions) Act facts which are

admitted need not be proved.

The idea of showing a document or contents of a VCD in cross examination is to

get admissions with regard to the contents or part of the contents of it or to get

admissions in relation to that document or VCD (for e.g.; the receipt of such

document or signature on it or of what is contained therein). The document or

VCD can be marked in cross examination only if a fact relating to that document

or VCD is admitted. If any admission takes place there is no need to adduce

evidence to prove that. If the witness refuses to identify or make any admission

with regard to what is shown during cross examination the opposite party cannot

mark it or produce it as part of the trial proceedings. In this context I do not think

Section 7(1) of the evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 has anything

to do with contemporaneous recordings or electronic evidence shown during the

cross examination.lf the witness cannot identify or make any admission with

regard to it, matter ends there and if the party who relied on it wants to tender it

in evidence then he/she will have to follow the provisions of law, including section

7 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, to prove it.

Under the aforesaid circumstances it is my considered view that learned District

Judge erred in considering Section 7(1) as applicable or governs the evidential

material that are to be shown in cross examination. Even the witness could have

made admission after seeing that. One of the objections is that the Plaintiff

5

denied that he is there in the VCD. The Plaintiff in his evidences in chief, when

questioned about the existence of a VCD, has said that he has heard about it and

denied his appearances in it but his answer relates to a VCD he has heard

about.That answer was given without seeing the real VCD and its contents.

Therefore, it is not a ground to refuse the application of the Defendant to show

the contents of the VCD and cross examine. However, my view is that Section

30f the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 has some relevance here.

It provides for causes omisus. No section in the said Act provides for computer

evidence or contemporaneous recordings shown to the witness during cross

examinations. The learned District Judge erred by contemplating section 7(1) of

the said Act has provided for such situations.

Aforesaid Section 3 reads as follows;

"3(1) For the determination of any matter arising out of the application of the

provisions of this Act or incidental thereto and not provided for in this Act, the

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance or any other law shall, where appropriate,

and with suitable adaptations as the justice of the case may require, be adopted

and applied.

(2) For the purpose of applying the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance or

other law for the determination of any matter not provided or in this Act, the

provisions relating to documents or governing a like matter in the Evidence

Ordinance or such other law shall with such suitable adaptations as the

interests of justice may require, be adopted and applied in the case of a

recoding, reproduction, statement or other evidence admissible under this

Act.

(3) Where it is not appropriate or practical to adapt and apply the provisions

of the Evidence Ordinance or other law as aforesaid for the determination of

any matter not provided for this Act, the court may in the exercise of its

6

inherent power, determine such matter by making such order as the interests

of justice may require."

It is clear that the learned District Judge could have used Section 3(1) and (2) and

adapt proviso to Section 175 (2) of the Civil Produce code to allow the application

made by the Defendants. Therefore, it is my considered view that learned District

Judge erred in refusing the application. Since the application was made during

the cross examination there was no delay in making the application. Questions of

lashes could not have arisen. The objection saying that there is no provision in law

to allow the application cannot hold water due to the existence of Section 3 of the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 1995. On the other hand, what is to be

shown during the cross examination need not be listed. It is a way of getting

admissions relating to which is produced in cross examination. Furthermore,

whether this is the VCD the Plaintiff denied containing his appearance has to be

ascertain only after showing it to him. Thus, I do not see any other valid ground of

objection for the learned District Judge to refuse the application of the

Defendants.

In his written submission to this court the counsel of the Plaintiff Respondent has

stated that prior to 1995 the VCD could not have been produced in Evidence. By

this he tries to convey that under Evidence Ordinance a VCD cannot be admitted

as evidence. Though I doubt this view to certain extent I do not wish to go into

detail with regard to that supposition as I have already decided the learned

District Judge could have allowed the application under Section 3 of the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act.

However, I must state that some texts indicate that the digital recording on a

compact disc is done by creating marked spots (pits or holes, laser burnt spots

etc.) and unmarked spots (Flat area or lands and unburnt spots etc.) recorded on

it.The change of the reflection of laser beam on pits and flat areas or burnt spots

or unburnt spots represent '1'sand 'O's.(Videhttps:l!www.iasa-web.org/tc05/231-

recording-principle visited on 6.6.2018).As per Section 3 of Evidence

Ordinance,any matter expressed or described upon any substances and recorded

r

7

therein by means of letters, figures or marks or by more than one of those means

can be considered as a document. In that sense,even the Evidence Ordinance

could have been interpreted to recognize VCD as documentary evidence.

As mentioned before in this order the learned District Judge erred in refusing the

application of the Defendants. He should have allowed it under Section 3 of the

evidence (Special Provisions) Act while adapting proviso to Section 175 (2) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

Hence, I allowed the leave to appeal application and the appeal and allow the

Defendants to show the VCD and its contents to the Plaintiff witness and cross

examine but the marking of the VCD can be allowed only if the Plaintiff witness

make any admission in relation to the VCD and/or its contents.
