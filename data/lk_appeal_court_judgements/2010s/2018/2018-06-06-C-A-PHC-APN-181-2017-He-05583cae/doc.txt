P.PADMAN SURASENA, l. (PICA)

Court heard the submissions of the learned counsel for the

Petitioner. Petitioner concedes that he has not lodged an appeal against

the judgment of the Provincial High Court. This court observes that this

is an application for revision. Petitioner has had a right of appeal to

lodge an appeal to this court against the Provincial High Court judgment.

He has not exercised that right. Therefore, this court has to look for

exceptional circumstances in this case. It is the observation of this court

that the petitioner has not pleaded any exceptional circumstances in the

petition. Even from the submissions made by the learned counsel for the

petitioner this court is unable to gather any legal basis, leave alone any

exceptional circumstances, to form some legal basis for the issuance of

notice on the respondent.

,1 3

Admittedly, the petitioner (according to the learned counsel) has

not made an application to the relevant authority for obtaining a permit

for the relevant development activities. In these circumstances, this

court sees no illegality, irregularity or inappropriacy in this case.

Therefore this court does not have any basis for issuance of notices on

the respondents. Thus, this court refuses to issue notices on the

respondents. Application must stand dismissed without costs.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

A.L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J. I agree.
