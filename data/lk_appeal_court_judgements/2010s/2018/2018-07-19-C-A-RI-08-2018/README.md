Samayawardhena, J.

The defendant-petitioner filed this application for restitutio in

integrum and revision seeking to set aside the judgment, decree

nisi and decree absolute entered against her by the District Court

of Kurunagala in case No. 5906/D in the year 2002 on the basis

that the plaintiff-respondent-her husband has obtained the divorce

judgment ex parte by fraud without serving summons on her.

Whether or not summons was in fact served is a question of fact

and not of law, which has to be decided after an inquiry at which

evidence would ordinarily be led. Therefore the appropriate forum

to hold such an inquiry is not this Court but the District Court.

That is the settled law.

Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera1 is to the point. In that case like in

the instant case a decree entered in a divorce suit was sought to be

set aside by way of an application for revision and/or restitutio in

integrum on the ground of fraud committed by (a) service of

summons on being pointed out without verification by affidavit of

the person pointing out, (b) false pleadings and evidence and (c)

getting an imposter to be present in Court in response to alleged

service of notice of decree nisi. Upholding the preliminary objection

and dismissing the application in limine Justice Siva Selliah

reviving the earlier authorities held:

The practice has grown and almost hardened into a rule that

where a decree has been entered ex parte in a District Court

and is sought to be set aside on any ground, application must

in the first instance be made to that very Court and that it is

only where the finding of the District Court on such application

is not consistent with reason or the proper exercise of the

Judge's discretion or where he has misdirected himself on the

facts or law that the Court of Appeal will grant the

extraordinary relief by way of Revision or Restitutio in

Integrum.

This is good law and stands to reason.

In Kusumawathie v. Wijesinghe2 and Paulis v. Joseph3the two

cases strongly relied upon by counsel for the petitionerthe above

mentioned approach could not be adopted as the husbands by

whom ex parte judgments had been obtained were dead when the

revision and/or restitutio in integrum applications seeking to set

aside ex parte decrees were filed before this Court. This clear from

the following observation of Justice Jayasinghe at page 245 of the

former case: "I do not see any purpose of sending back the case for

inquiry/re-trial as the Plaintiff is dead. Hence on the material

tendered to this Court I am satisfied that the decree for divorce had

been obtained without the knowledge or notice to the Defendant-

Petitioner."; and the following observation of Justice Imam at page

167 in the latter case: "Although the position of the 1st Respondent

is that the Petitioner should have gone to the District Court as it has

original jurisdiction and where a due inquiry would be held.

However there is no merit in this submission, as the Plaintiff

(Petitioner's husband) is now dead and she obviously cannot go to

the District Court." In contrast, in the instant case both parties are

alive. Hence those two cases are clearly distinguishable.

This law is not only applicable to ex parte divorce judgments but

also to any ex parte judgment or ex parte order of the District

Court.

In Jana Shakthi Insurance v. Dasanayake4 Justice Wimalachandra

stated:

It is settled law that a party affected by an order of which he

had no notice must apply in the first instance to the Court

which made the order. The petitioner must first file the

necessary papers in the original Court and initiate an inquiry

into the allegations made by him. After such inquiry, if the

petitioner is dissatisfied with the order made by the District

Court, he can thereafter raise the matter before the Court of

Appeal. The Court of Appeal then would be in a position to

make an order on the issues after taking into consideration

the order made by the District Court.

Under what provision of the law such an application to the District

Court could be made? It is clear that such an application cannot

be made under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code as 14 day

period from the alleged service of the decree has as always long

lapsed by the time the applicant becomes aware of the ex parte

decree. The answer to that question is found in the dicta of

Justice S.N. Silva (as His Lordship then was) in Sitthi Maleeha v.

Nihal Ignatius Perera5.

In this case the defendant is seeking to set aside the decree on

the basis that summons was not served on him. In Ittepana v.

Hemawathie6, it was held by the Supreme Court that the

failure to serve summons is one which goes to the root of the

jurisdiction of the Court. That, if a defendant is not served with

summons or otherwise notified of the proceedings against him,

the judgment entered in such circumstances is a nullity and

the person affected by the proceedings can apply to have them

set aside ex debito justitiae. It was specifically held that the

District Court has inherent jurisdiction in terms of section 839

of the Civil Procedure Code to inquire into the question of non-

service of summons.

Then the next question is what procedure to be followed at such an

inquiry? The answer to that question is found in the dicta of

Justice S.N. Silva (as His Lordship then was) in De Fonseka v.

Dharmawardena7.

An inquiry on an application to set aside an ex parte decree is

not regulated by any specific provision of the Civil Procedure

Code. Such inquiries must be conducted consistently with the

principles of natural justice and the requirement of fairness.

Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code recognizes the

inherent power of the court to make an order as may be

necessary for the ends of justice.

I refuse to issue notice on the respondent. Let the petitioner go

before the proper forum and make the application.

Application is dismissed.
