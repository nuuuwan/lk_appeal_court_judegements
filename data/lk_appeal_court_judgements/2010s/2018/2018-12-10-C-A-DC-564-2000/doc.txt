A

t the hearing before this Court the argument on behalf of the parties was focused

on whether Lot No.2 in preliminary Plan bearing No.3380 should be part of the

corpus sought to be partitioned by the Plaintiff. If one peruses the petition of appeal,

the aforesaid dispute as to the corpus appears to be the one and only point that has

been raised. In other words the judgment of the District Court of Kegalle dated

1

4th August 2000 has not been challenged in regard to the correctness of the devolution

of title set up in the plaint dated 3rd May 1983. It would then follow that the finding of

the learned Additional District Judge of Kegalle that devolution of title to the land

should be on the basis of the pedigree pleaded in the plaint is not challenged by the 1st

Defendant/Appellant in his petition of appeal.

The only question that arises would be whether Lot No.2 in preliminary plan which is

at page 215 of the brief should form part of the corpus. The plaintiff's consistent

position has been that Lots 1 and 2 in the preliminary plan marked "X" constituted the

corpus called "Ranapanaduraya Watte". The 2nd Defendant too states at para 2 of his

statement of claim that the corpus is "Ranapanaduraya Watte"/see page 71 of the brief.

It is the 1st Defendant (who is the Defendant/Appellant in this case) who states at para

2 of his statement of claim at page 48 of the brief that only Lot No.1 in the preliminary

Plan No.3380 should be the corpus and that Lot No.2 should be excluded. According to

the tt Defendant, Lot No.2 is a part of a land called "Berakaraya Watte".

The question whether or not lot No.2 is a portion of the corpus must no doubt be

determined with reference to the boundaries in the deed.

Is Lot No.2 a part of a land called ''Berakaraya Watte" as claimed by the tt

Defendant~ Appellant?

The Deed No.2876 at page 206 of the brief shows that the 1st Defendant/Appellant has

purchased his interests to his land through this deed but the deed clearly demonstrates

that "Berakaraya Watte" is situated to the east of the corpus. Even the preliminary plan

No.3380 at page 215 shows that "Berakaraya Watte" is to the east of Lot No.2. Therefore it

follows that Lot No.2 as depicted in the plan cannot possibly be a portion of "Berakaraya

Watte", because "Berakaraya Watte" being the eastern boundary of the corpus falls outside

the corpus.

As contended by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff/Respondent, even the Deed

bearing No.2876 upon which the 1st Defendant/Appellant derived his rights shows that

"Berakaraya Watte" falls outside the corpus. In the circumstances the more probable

version is that Lot No.1 and Lot No.2 would form the corpus.

According to Denning J. in Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All ER 372 (KBD)

at page 374:~

"If the evidence is such that the tribunal can say: 'we think it more probable than not,' the burden

is discharged, but, if the probabilities are equal, it is not."

In civil cases the test is not whether one party's version is more probable than the other

party's for it may be that neither version of events is credible~see Rhesa Shipping v.

Edmunds (1985) 1 WLR 948 (House of Lords). The party bearing the burden will

discharge it only if the tribunal of fact is satisfied that his version of events is more

probable than any alternative version.

However, the phrase 'balance of probabilities' is often employed as a convenient phrase

to express the basis upon which civil issues are decided but the test says nothing about

how far above so per cent the probability should be that his version of events is correct.

One theory holds that anything over so per cent suffices, no matter what the nature of

the allegation (the so~called '51 per cent test'~see Davies v. Taylor [1972] 3 WLR 801

(HL) p.81O).

It is abundantly clear that the version of the Plaintiff~Respondents is more probable

than that of the Defendant~Appellant as to the corpus and in my view the evidence

proffered by the Plaintiff~ Respondents satisfies the standard of proof as postulated by

Denning J, and even its probability over the so percent watershed as articulated in

Davies (supra).

In the circumstances I proceed to affirm the judgment of the District Court of Kegalle

dated 4th August 2000 and dismiss the appeal of the Defendant~Appellant.
