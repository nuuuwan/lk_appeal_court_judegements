JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for both Parties, when the argument of this case was

concluded on 2017-10-31 before this Court, agreed to file in the registry by

2017-12-12, written submissions setting out the respective positions they

took up in the course of the said argument. 1 Learned counsel for the 1 st,2nd

and 4th Respondents - Respondents(hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the 1st and 2nd 4th Respondents respectively) has thereafter filed his

written submissions. However, the learned counsel for the Petitioner -

Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellants) has failed

to tender any written submissions for the consideration of this Court up

until now.

Thus, this Court regrettably note that it has been deprived of the

opportunity by the Appellant himself to properly appraise the arguments

that were put forward by him in Court. Therefore, this Court is left only

with the written submissions filed by the Respondents in addition to the

submissions made by counsel in Court.

Appellants in the application filed before the Provincial High Court had

prayed

i. For a writ of certiorari and prohibition to quash the decision

contained in the documents marked P 4 A and P 4 B

ii. For a Writ of mandamus to compel the pt and 2nd Respondents not

to enforce the said decision.

The decision contained in the document marked P 4 B is a decision made

by the Agrarian services inquiring officer on 29th March 1996 subsequent to

an inquiry held under section 5 (3) of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of

1979 as amended by the Act No. 04 of 1991. The letter marked P 4 A is

the letter by which the said decision has been communicated to the

parties.

Learned counsel for the Appellant mainly relied on the 'register of landlords

and cultivators' maintained at the Agrarian Services Office for the year

1980. According to the said register, the names of the Appellants have

been entered as the landlords and the cultivators also. In other words,

there is no tenant cultivator for the said land according to the said register.

6

However admittedly it was in the year 1989 that this register had been

updated on a mere application by the Appellant without any inquiry. To the

contrary, evidence led before the inquiring officer has clearly shown that

the Appellant had forcibly taken possession of this paddy field. Other than

the above register, the Appellants had not been able to produce any

evidence before the inquiring officer to establish that they are entitled to

any rights to the relevant paddy field. This court has perused the inquiry

proceedings and finds no material in favour of the Appellants.

In the case of Council of Civil Service Unions and others Vs Minister for the

Civil Service 2 (case relied upon by the learned State Counsel for the 1st ,

2nd , and 4th Respondents in his written submissions) Lord Diplock classified

the grounds for judicial review into 3 main categories in following terms.

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

abouC one can conveniently classify under 3 heads the grounds upon

which the administrative action are subject to control by judicial review.

The pt ground I would call "illegalityF; the second ''irrationalityF; and the

third "procedural improprietyF~ That is not to say that further development

on a case by case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I

have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle

of 'proportionalityF which is recognized in the administrative law of several

of our fellow members of the European Economic Community; but to

2 198403 A E R 935.

7

dispose of the instant case the three already well-established heads that I

have mentioned wt'll suffice . ... " 3

Considering the submissions made before us by the learned counsel for the

Appellants, it appeared that the Appellant's intention in this application is to

indirectly attempt to canvass the correctness of the decision of the 1st

Respondent as if this is an appeal against the said decision.

This Court observes that this Court in Browns Engineering (Pvt) Ltd. Vs

Commissioner of Labor and others 4 has held that a relief by way of

certiorari is available only if the public functionary has wholly or in part

assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or has exceeded such

jurisdiction which it has or has acted contrary to the principles of natural

justice or when its decision is eminently unreasonable or irrational or is

guilt of a substantial error of law.

His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya has categorically stated in the above

judgement that the remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to

correct errors or to substitute a correct order for a wrong order. As he has

stated in that judgement "on an appeal the question is right or wrong on

review the question is lawful or unlawful." Further, it would be relevant to

reproduce here the following paragraph from the above judgment of His

Lordship Justice Jayasuriya. It is as follows.

3 At page 950.

4 1998 01 SRI LR 88.

" ." The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of

appeals. When hearing an appeal, a court is concerned with the merits of

the decision under appeal; when subjecting some administrative act or

order to judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality. On an

appeal, the question is right or wrong? On review the question is lawful or

unlawful? ... ff Judicial review is a fundamentally different operation to the

exercise of appellate jurisdiction. A court on review is concerned only with

the question whether the award under attack should be allowed to stand or

not. - Vide Prof. H W R Wade on Administrative Law, 7th edition, pages 38

to 39. Thus, the object of this court upon judicial review is strictly to

consider whether the whole or part of the award of compensation

pronounced by the Commissioner of Labour is lawful or unlawful. This

court ought not to exercise its appellate powers and jurisdiction when

engaged in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction and judicial review

over an award of compensation decreed by the Commissioner of Labour.

"

In view of the settled legal positions set out above, this Court is not

inclined to consider this case as an appeal against the said impugned

decision. In any case, the Appellants have not satisfied this Court that even

any grounds of that nature also exists in this case.

This Court observes that the procedure for such inquiry has been set out in

section 5 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 as amended. It is the

view of this court that the inquiring officer has followed the correct

9

procedure in conducting this inquiry. In any case, the Appellants have not

complained that the procedure followed by the inquiring officer is incorrect.

This Court also observes that maintaining of a register for the tenant

cultivators and landlords is not a requirement under the Agrarian Services

Act. This Court also observes that under section 2 of the Agrarian Services

Act, even an oral agreement is sufficient to establish that a person is a

tenant cultivator.

It is also interesting to note that the Appellants have appealed against the

impugned decision of the pt Respondent to the Agrarian Services Board of

review. This Court observes that the Agrarian Services Board of review

after considering the said appeal has affirmed the impugned order by the

inquiring officer. The Appellants has not up until now challenged the said

decision of the Agrarian Services Board of review (produced marked P 6

B). This confirms the fact that the Appellant in this application has

attempted wrongfully to re agitate the inquiring officer's decision after they

lost their appeal before the Agrarian Services Board of Review.

This Court also observes that the Appellants had not chosen to challenge

the impugned order by the 1st Respondent at any time before the Agrarian

Services Board of review dismissed their appeal. This clearly shows that the

Appellant had not observed any illegality, any irrationality, or any

procedural impropriety in the said order at any time before the Agrarian

Services Board of review dismissed their appeal. This leads this Court to

10

think that the filing of the instant application by the Appellants has

amounted to abuse of process of Court.

Another observation this Court makes in the application of the petitioner is

that the Petitioners have prayed for a writ of mandamus to compel the

respondents to refrain from doing an act. It is the view of this Court that

the said prayer is misconceived in law.

An applicant in a writ application must come to court with clean hands; he

or she cannot have a hidden agenda. The hidden agenda of the Appellant

in the instant case is to do what they otherwise cannot do i.e. to re-agitate

the dismissed appeal by Agrarian Services Board of Review.

Writ jurisdiction of Court is a discretionary jurisdiction. It is exercised at the

discretion of Court. This has been clearly explained by Jayasuriya J in

Jayaweera vs Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and

another [1986 (2) SLR 70J when he said " .... I hold that the Petitioner who

is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of Certiorari is not

entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter

f t " o rou Ine ....

The Court when deciding whether to exercise its discretion is entitled to

take the conduct of the Applicant into consideration.

11

For the foregoing reasons it is the view of this Court that the refusal by the

Provincial High Court to grant the writ sought by the Appellant is justifiable.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this application. The Appellants are

directed to pay a cost of Rs.50, 000 to the Respondent.
