the sentence and not the conviction. After considering evidence and the

submissions made by both parties, we decide to vary the sentence.

Considering the length of time the Appellant has spent in Prison, we decide to

affirm the conviction and vary the sentence.

Sentence for the charge is brought down to 15 years rigorous imprisonment but

the fine and the compensation will remain as it is with the default terms.

The Sentence should start from the date of conviction which is the 23.06.2009.

Default terms should run concurrently with the sentence. Under the above

variation in the sentence, the judgment of the High Court Judge is affirmed and

the appeal is dismissed.
