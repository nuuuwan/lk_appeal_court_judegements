Before : Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel : Padma Bandara P.C., with Shanil

Petitioner.

Mithree Jayasinghe S.C., for the

Respondent.

Argued &

Decided on : 18.10.2018

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to set aside

the order of the Land Acquisition Board of Review dated 06.05.2015.

Learned State Counsel appearing for the respondent takes up two

preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of this

application. One is a jurisdictional objection and the other is the

failure to make the necessary parties as respondents to the

application.

I will first deal with the second preliminary objection.

It is elementary that the person whose decision is sought to be

challenged shall necessarily be made a party to the action. Without

giving him a hearing, no Court is entitled to set aside his decision. If

the Court does so, it is a grave violation of natural justiceaudi

alteram partem. That is very basic and not at all high-flown law.

In this action, only the Acquiring Officer has been made a party. It is

against the Acquiring Officers decision, the petitioner has gone before

the Land Acquisition Board of Review.

3 If I may repeat, the petitioner has come before this Court against the

decision of the Land Acquisition Board of Review and not against that

of the Acquiring Officer.

The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner

that making the Land Acquisition Board of Review and/or its

members a party to the action is necessary only in a writ application,

but not in a revision application such as this is devoid of merit.

I have no hesitation to conclude that without making the Land

Acquisition Board of Review and/or its members a party to the action,

the petitioner cannot maintain this action.

The second preliminary objection taken up by the learned State

Counsel for the respondent is upheld and the petitioners application

is dismissed but without costs.
