The Counsel Mr. Palitha Fernando, President's Counsel who is appearing for the

Accused Appellant made submission and states that he wishes to inform the Court

and the Judge had ordered to implement the sentences consecutively, Totalling to 20

years rigorous imprisonment. He submits that the Accused-Appellant was convicted

on one act, technically 4 offences. The Counsel moves to withdraw the appeal against

the conviction and make an application to reconsider the sentence and to make the

sentences to be implemented concurrently.

Senior State Counsel Mr. Wasantha Perera has no objection to this application.

We consider the submissions of both Counsels and decide to affirm the sentence on

Count Number 1, 2, 3 & 4. Further, considering all circumstances, we direct the

Prison Authority to implement the sentence concurrently. Further, it is brought to

the notice of Court that the Accused Appellant was incarcerated from the date of

concurrently from the date of conviction namely, 27.09.2013.
