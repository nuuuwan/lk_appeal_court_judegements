No. HCR 149/2012 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the

Learned Magistrate ofWariyapola dated 19.10.2012 in Case No. 87256.

Facts of the Case:

The accused-3 fd respondent- respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused')

was charged in the Magistrate's Court of Wariyapola for illegally transporting

timber in a vehicle bearing No. 57 - 0792 on or about 03.02.2012, an offence

punishable under section 25(2) read with sections 30A, 40, 40A and 25(1) of the

Forest Ordinance (as amended). The accused pleaded guilty to the charge on

27.04.2012. Accordingly the Learned Magistrate convicted him and imposed a fine

of Rs.20, 0001- with a default term of 6 months simple imprisonment.

Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held 'where the registered owner of the vehicle

(hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant) had given evidence and the inquiry was

concluded. The Learned Magistrate confiscated the said vehicle by order dated

19.10.2012 stating that the registered ovYner had the knowledge about the accused

utilizing the vehicle for such illegal purpose.

Thereafter the appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of

Kurunegala under case No. HCR 149/2012 which was dismissed by the Learned

High Court Judge by the order dated 06.02.2015.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred an appeal to this

Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted following grounds of appeal;

a) The said judgment is contrary to law and against the weight of evidence,

b) The Learned High Court Judge had not properly appreciated and

evaluated the precautionary ineasures taken by the aggrieved party

petitioner-appellant,

Page 4 of 10

c) The inference drawn by the Learned Magistrate in imputing the

knowledge of the commission ut' the offence to the appellant has been

incorrectly held as correct by thE>. Leanled High Court Judge.

The appellant in the vehicle inquiry haj testified that there were no preVIOUS

records of using this vehicle for illegal pu,rposes by the accused and the behaviour

of the accused was good until this inciddnt. The appellant had further stated that

the accused left the appellant's place on 0 Z: 02 .2012 for a hire to the airport and he

advised the accused to not to use the vehicle for any illegal purposes.

In the case of Manawadu V. The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30, it was held

that,

"By Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1982 it was not intended to deprive an owner

of his vehicle used by the offender in committing a 'forest offence' without

his (owner's) knowledge and witho,:4t his participation. The word 'forfeited'

must be given the meaning 'liable to be forfeited' so as to avoid the injustice

that would flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the accused The amended sub-section 40 does not

exclude by necessary implication the rule of 'audi alteram partem' . The

owner of the lorry not a party to the case is entitled to be heard on the

question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfies the court that the accused

. committed the offence without his knowledge or participation, his lorry will

not be liable to forfeiture.

The Magistrate must hear the owner of the lorry on the question of showing

cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied

with the cause shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. The Magistrate

may consider the question of rek'c1sing the lorry to the owner pending

Page 5 Jf 10

inquiry, on his entering into a bond with sufficient security to abide by the

order that may ultimately be binding on him"

In the case of Faris V. The Officer in charge, Police Station,

Galenbindunuwewa and another (1992) 1 S.L.R. 167, it was held that,

" ... an order for confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of

two matters. They are:

i. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence;

ll. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without

his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes anyone of these matters on

a balance of probability, an order for confiscation should not be made ... "

I

We observe that the Learned Magistrate has considered the fact that the accused

had informed Court on 13.06.2012 about Fhe inability of the appellant to be present

in Court and got the case re-fixed for inqljry. The Learned Magistrate had come tQ

a conclusion that the evidence of the appellant was not trustworthy since he was

maintaining a close relationship with the accused even if the appellant testified that

he fired the accused.

In the case of Orient Financial Servic:,es Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

i { I

~

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was

committed without his knowledge ,'tor he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner, "

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. ?H. De Silva rCA (PH C) 86/97], it was

held that.

"For these reasons 1 hold that gi /ing mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She mz...s't establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took eve,y endeavor to implement the

instructions .. , "

In light of above, it is our view that tq~ burden is cast on the vehicle owner to

prove to the satisfaction of Court that any such offence was committed without his

knowledge and/or he had taken every 'possible step to prevent an offence being

committed. The Learned Magistrate of \Variyapola has held as follows;

" ... ~~~ ('3"'::J~~o!) qS?5J25)~ @~::J~l & @l ~Z'.f e'J 8('3@t'{D qa25)6~"'0 i(Z'.fth

\

Addressing the contention of the Learn~d Counsel for the appellant in the High

i Court, the Learned High Court Judge ha~ held that the Learned Magistrate was not

acting upon a mere assumption but had considered the evidence on a balance of

probabilities. Accordingly the Learned High Court in the order dated 06.02.2015

has held that,

Therefore coming into a similar conclusion, we are of the view that the appellant's

version of evidence where he stated that ~e had given instructions to the accused

was not reliable since the credibility of said evidence was challenged. Therefore

we agree with the findings of both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High

Court Judge.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others (2004) 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

''In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

.' have occasioned a failure of justice 'and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irreg::tlarity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order cor,1plained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

"The powers of revision conferred o~ the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the cO:.-lrt ... "

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd.

(2003) 3 SLR 24, where it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumsta.-1ces is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of" which the extraordinary method of

Page 8 of 10

rectification should be adopted.t: such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this cour will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the gad of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legis/::zture has not given a right of appeal ... "

Therefore the revisionary powers of this Court shall not be exercised when there

was no illegality, irregularity or failure o(justice in aforesaid orders. Accordingly

we see no reason to interfere with the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Kurunegala dated 06.02.2015 and the confiscation order made by the Learned

Magistrate ofWariyapola dated 19.10.2012.

Accordingly the revision application is dis:.nissed without costs.
