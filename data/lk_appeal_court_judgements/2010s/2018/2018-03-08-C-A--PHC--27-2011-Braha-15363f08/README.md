JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PLCA)

The Petitioner- Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellants) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of

Western Province holden at Gamapaha praying for the following mandates;

1. a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash

7

i. the approval if any, granted by the 1st and / or 2nd Respondents

for the construction of any building and / or boundary wall in

the sa id lot 1 A,

ii. the certificate of conformity, if any, issued by the 1st and / or

2nd Respondents in respect of any construction done in the said

lot 1 A,

in violation of the law

2. a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus to compel the 1st and

/ or 2nd Respondents to take all necessary steps under section 52 of

the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 to have the buildings and /

or boundary walls constructed in the said lot 1 A in violation of the

Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance and / or the Pradeshiya

Sabha Act, demolished or removed.

3. a mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition to restrain the 1st and

/ or 2nd Respondents from issuing any certificate of conformity in

respect of any building and / or boundary wall constructed in the said

lot 1 A in violation of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance

and / or Pradeshiya Sabha Act, and which are therefore unauthorized

constructions.

8

The Petitioner - Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) are

all residents of 2nd Cross Street, Alwis Town Hendala. They are members of

the 'Association of Residents of Alwis Town Hedala'.

The property relevant to the writ application filed by the Petitioners in the

Provincial High Court is described in paragraph 4 of the petition dated

2008-11-13 filed in the Provincial High Court. The Complaint of the

appellants is that the 3rd and 4th Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the 3rd & 4th Respondents) who are said to be the owners of

the said property (Lot 1 A on plan No. 4617, Deed of transfer No.1375

dated 2008-01-30 attested by B. Yogeswari Notary public) have unlawfully

engaged in an unauthorized construction in the said premises violating the

prevailing laws. Underlying reason as to why the Petitioners are particularly

aggrieved is the fact that the said constructions have posed a danger to

them as they are exposed to accidents when turning from Alwis Town road

to 2nd Cross road. The risk of exposing the Appellants for danger has

assumed a serious level as the said unauthorized construction is situated

right at the said turning pOint. The fact that the said situation exists is clear

from the plan dated 2002-08-11, the sketch produced marked B 1 by the

9

Petitioners and the document produced marked B 2 etc. These factual

positions have not been controverted by the Respondents at any time.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge in her judgement dated 2011-02-23

has refused to issue the writs the Appellants have prayed for, on the basis

that the 3rd and 4th Respondents had constructed the impugned structures

with necessary approval by the 1st Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the 1st Respondent) Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge had relied on the documents produced

marked 1 R1 to 1 R3 in the Provincial High Court to come to this

conclusion.

It is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the survey plan No.

4617 dated 2005-12-14 (1 R1) and the building plan No. 1076 (1 R2)

have been duly approved according to the existing regulations.

The survey plan No. 4617 dated 2005-12-14 produced marked 1 R1 by the

Respondents is the same as the survey plan relied upon by the Petitioners.

Although the 1st Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha takes up the position that

this plan is duly approved, it is the position of the Petitioners that the

Pradeshiya Sabha could not have legally approved it within their powers.

10

Therefore, this Court now has to turn to the prevailing provisions of law in

this regard.

Section 111 (1) of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance ...

Section 111

(1) No person shall erect any masonry boundary wall or gateway -

(a) within the street lines of any street for which street lines

have been defined; or

(b) in the case of any street for which no street lines have been

defined, within twenty feet of the center of the street

unless in such case he shall have received the written permission of the

Chairman.

(2) In the case last-mentioned the Chairman may require as a

condition of such permission that the owner of the premises shall

execute an undertaking that no compensation shall be payable in

respect of such boundary wall or gateway in the event of the land

on which such wall or gateway is situated being acquired for public

purposes, or being included in the street under this Ordinance.

11

(3) No person shall erect any masonry boundary wall of a height

exceeding seven and a half feet.

Provided, howeve~ that this subsection shall not apply to any

boundary wall which abuts upon any street

(4) Where any land is situated at the junction of any two streets, no

shall erect any masonry boundary wall or gateway on such land in

contravention of the following condition~ that is to say, that no

part of such boundary wall or gateway which is within a distance of

thirty feet from the point of such boundary wall or gateway which

is nearest to the center of the junction, shall be of a height

exceeding five feet

(5) Any person who shall erect any masonry boundary wall or gateway

in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence, and

shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred

rupee~ and the court upon conviction of any person under

subsection (J)(b), in the event of the person convicted declining to

execute the undertaking referred to in this section, may make an

order in the terms of such undertaking, and every such order may

12

be registered, and shall be binding upon the land in the same

manner as an undertaking under this section.

Section 30 of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance .....

Section 30. Buildings at the corners of streets.

The local authority may require the corner of any building

intended to be erected or re-erected at the corner of two streets

to be rounded off or splayed off to the height of the first storey or

to the full height of the building, and to such extent otherwise as

it may determine, and for any loss which may be sustained

through the exercise of the powers by this section conferred upon

the local authority it shall pay compensation in manner provided

for by this Ordinance.

Section 49 of the Pradeshiya Sabha act No.1S of 1987 ...

Section 49 - Building limits along roads

''Notwithstanding anything contained in the Housing and Town

Improvement Ordinance, or other law it shall not be lawful for any person -

i 1 ! 1 I I ! , 13

(a) to erect any building, boundary wall or gateway within a limit

(hereinafter referred to as the ''building limit'') of twenty-five feet from the

center of any road which is used or intended for vehicular traffic within

limits of any Pradeshiya Sabha and in respect of which street lines

providing for a roadway exceeding fifty feet in width have not been defined

under this Act or the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance:

Provided, however, that the Pradeshiya Sabha, shall have power to

authorize the erection of a boundary wall or gateway on condition that the

owners of the premises shall execute an undertaking that no compensation

shall be payable in respect of such boundary wall or gateway in the event

of the land on which such wall or gateway is situated being required for a

public purposes; or

(b) except under the authority of a license granted by the Pradeshiya

Sabha to re-erect or to any addition to any such building, boundary wall or

gateway within such limit:

Provided always that nothing contained in this subsection shall apply to any

repairs effected in any building, boundary wall or gateway existing at the

date of the constitution of the Pradeshiya Sabha or in the case of -

14

i. any street which is intended for foot traffick only and is not less than

twenty feet in width; or

ii. any back lane or other service passage which is intended only for the

purposes of scavenging or conservancy or other special sanitary

purpose and is not less than ten feet in width where such street, lane

or passage has been defined or approved by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

For the purpose of the foregoing provisions of this subsection, ''repairs''

shall not be deemed to include any work of re-erection or re -

construction or the addition of any new part

Section 52 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act ....

Section 52 - Power of Pradeshiya Sabha to deal with building

boundary wall or gateway erected in contravention of law.

If any person erects or re-erects any building, boundary wall or gateway,

or makes any addition to any building, boundary wall or gateway, within

the limits of any Pradeshiya Sabha in contravention of any of the provisions

of section 49, the Pradeshiya Sabha shall be entitled to cause such

building, boundary wall or gateway, or such addition, to be demolished or

15

removed by any officer or servant, and for that purpose the Pradeshiya

Sabha shall have the same rights of entry and survey, and shall have the

same power of removal abatement and recovery of costs as are vested by

this part in a Pradeshiya Sabha for the purposes of the abatement or

removal of any obstruction or encroachment or supposed obstruction or

encroachment upon a thoroughfare, and all the provisions of this Part

relating to such obstructions or encroachments, as far as they are

applicable, shall apply accordingly with such modifications as may be

necessary.

This Court observes that although the Respondents state that the relevant

construction has been duly approved, they have failed to satisfy this Court

that the relevant Pradeshiya Sabha has acted within their legal power in

granting the impugned approval.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners has drawn the attention of this Court to

the following two journal entries in the docket.

Dr. Sunil Cooray for the Appellant,

J. C. Boange for the 1st and 2nd Respondents,

Kishani Jayasinghe for the 3rd and 4th Respondents.

Heard all three counsel in support of their respective cases

Having argued the appeal, both counsel for the Respondents move that

they be given time to act according to the provisions of the Pradeshiya

Sabha Act and to submit an approved plan in respect of the boundary wall

and the building situated within the 25 feet from the center of Alwis Town

road if no such approved plan is available.

This is a matter in view of the decision of the learned High Court Judge

where she has referred to approved plan. However the court does not see

any plan approved for the construction of boundary in the brief.

Argument is refixed for 20/ 01/ 2015 .... /1

Journal entry dated 2015-01-20

17

Before K. T. Chithrasiri J

Malini Gunerathne J

Sunil Cooray with B. Gamage for the Petitioners,

J. C. Boange for the 1st and 2nd Respondents,

Kishani Jayasinghe for the 3rd and 4th Respondents.

Both counsel move that this matter be refixed enabling them to have the

constructions subject to in this case altered in accordance with the law.

Therefore counsel move that this matter be mentioned on 30-03-2015.

Mention on 30-03-2015 .... "

The inference that this Court can draw from what has transpired in Court is

that the respondents have not been able to produce any document with

which a Court of law could have been satisfied that the alleged unlawful

construction by the 3rd and 4th Respondents is a construction made in

conformity with the prevailing laws. Learned counsel for the Respondents

before this Court have failed to fulfill their undertaking given to his Court

either to submit to Court a lawful permit or to have the relevant

constructions altered in conformity with the law.

18

For the above reasons it is not difficult for this Court to conclude that the

learned Provincial High Court Judge has fallen into grave error when she

had concluded that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had granted due approval

for the said construction.

The above material shows convincingly to this Court the fact

i. that Hendala Pradeshiya Sabha could not have approved the

impugned construction according to law,

ii. that the Respondents have failed to produce in Court any document

which could be accepted as a granting of due approval for the said

construction according to law,

iii. that the 3rd and 4th Respondents have constructed the impugned

structures in violation of the prevailing law,

iv. that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had acted ultra-wires their powers if

they had granted approval for the 3rd and 4th Respondents to

construct the relevant structures

It is the view of this Court that it is because of the illegality of the relevant

construction that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have stated! that they had

1 Paragraph 6 (a) of their statement of objections dated 2009-05-06.

19

not applied for a certificate of conformity and that no such certificate has

been issued by the relevant Pradeshiya Sabha to the 3rd and 4th

Respondents. It is clear that the 3rd and 4th Respondents continue to

occupy these premises without a certificate of conformity issued by the

relevant Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Respondents despite the undertaking had failed to file any written

submissions before this Court within the time that was granted for them for

that purpose by this Court. Learned counsel for the 3rd and 4th Respondents

had filed a motion2 requesting further 3 weeks' time to file their written

submissions. This Court waited for the said extended period also affording

a further opportunity for the Respondents to file their written submissions.

However, this Court regrets to note that the 3rd and 4th Respondents or the

other Respondents have not up until now filed any written submissions.

Thus, this Court has to proceed on the basis that the Respondents have no

serious argument to be placed before this Court for its consideration.

2 Motion dated 2017-11-24.

20

In the case of Mageswaran vs University Grants Commission and others 3

cited by the learned counsel for the Appellants, this Court has held as

follows;

" ... A writ of mandamus only commands the person or body to whom it is

directed to perform a public duty imposed by law. In other words, a writ of

mandamus would lie where a statute requires certain action in defined

circumstances and despite the existence of such circumstances, the

required action has not been performed.... Thus, existence of legal right

and statutory duty are essential conditions for the issue of mandamus . ..... "

Consideration of factual and legal positions of the instant case set out

above satisfies this Court that both the conditions referred to in

Mageswaran's case have been fulfilled.

Further, this Court notes that Nagalingam ] in the case of The Chairman

Urban Council Matara Vs Abeysuriya 4 has stated as follows;

" ... However distatestful the task may be to have to make an order of

demolition, I do not think that the law should be permitted to be flouted so

fragrantly ..... "

In these circumstances this Court proceeds to set aside, the judgement

dated 2011-02-23 pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge.

This Court decides to issue the writs prayed for by the Petitioners in their

application made to the Provincial High Court.

This Court observes that the motion dated 2015-05-28, Appellants had

forwarded a letter setting out certain terms of settlement proposed to the

3rd and 4th Respondents. Paragraph 6 of the said letter containing the said

terms of settlement has proposed that the 3rd and 4th Respondent shall pay

to the Appellants a sum of Rs. 450,000/= which the Appellant shall accept

as reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Appellants in this litigation.

However, learned counsel for the 3rd and 4th Respondents despite the

undertaking given to Court had failed to respond to the proposed

settlements.

This Court has observed the conduct of the 3rd and 4th Respondents during

the proceedings both in the Provincial High Court as well as in this Court. It

,

22

is the view of this Court that they had taken all endeavors to drag this case

indefinitely without attempting to take any meaningful step towards

bringing their manifestly unauthorized construction to be in conformity with

prevailing laws.

In these circumstances this Court orders the 3rd and 4th Respondent to pay

as costs Rs. 300,000 to the Appellants.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge is directed to enforce without delay

the order made by this Court.

Appeal is allowed.
