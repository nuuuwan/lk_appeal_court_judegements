23 AA, 23 BB, 23 CC, 24 A, 24 B, 24 C, 24 D of the National

h) a writ of mandamus to compel the 1st - 5th Respondents to act under

the provisions of the respective laws in order to restore the

"Parangiyathotanne" to its original status and claim the expenses from

the 6th Respondent.

This case came up for inquiry on 2018-01-30 for this Court to decide whether

it should grant an interim relief prayed for by the Petitioner. The said inquiry

7

was fixed by this Court pursuant to an application made by the learned

counsel for the Petitioner.

At the conclusion of the said inquiry, it became manifest that this Court was

in possession of all relevant material pertaining to the issues, this Court is

called upon to decide in this case. Therefore, learned counsel for all the

parties agreed to conclude their oral submissions with regard to the

argument of the case. Therefore, this Court directed that the argument of

this case should pro forma stand concluded.

The primary complaint made by the Petitioners against the Respondents is

that the 6th Respondent has filled a land without obtaining necessary

approvals from the relevant state agencies.

It is the position of the 6th Respondent that he had developed this land after

obtaining all relevant approvals from all state agencies concerned.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General as well as the learned President's Counsel

for the 6th Respondent brought to the notice of this Court, the document

produced marked 6 R 1 which is a copy of the District Court Negambo case

No. S P 2849/07. It is a case filed by the pt Petitioner against the 6th

Respondent and two others. Admittedly, the said case was filed for the same

cause of action. The said District Court case has been concluded by arriving

8

at a settlement. The Petitioner in the instant case who is the Plaintiff in the

said District Court Negambo case, has agreed that he cannot object if the 6th

Respondent has developed this land according to the conditions laid down

by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation which is

the 3rd Respondent in this case. According to that settlement, it is still open

for the Petitioner to re-open the District Court case in case the 6th

Respondent fails to comply with the previously mentioned conditions. It was

on that basis that the District Court had terminated the proceedings of that

case. Thus, the Petitioner, as has been already done at one point time, has

recourse to an alternative remedy. It is also necessary for this Court to

observe that the said settlement has been recorded as far back as on 2009-

09-23.

It was brought to the notice of this Court by the Respondents that the filling

of this land has now been completed. The relevant authority has also issued

a certificate of conformity.

This Court observes that the petition in the instant case is dated 2016-10-

20. The Petitioner has been aware of the actions by the 6th Respondents

regarding the filling of this land. The said actions date back to the year 2007.

This is manifest from the plaint filed in the District Court of Negambo, which

9

is dated 2007-09-19. This shows that it was after seven years that the

Petitioner has suddenly started thinking about the environmental hazards

and decided to file the instant case before this Court.

The Petitioner had agreed before the District Court of Negambo in the year

2009 that the 6th Respondent is free to develop this land according to the

conditions laid down by the 2nd Respondent (SLLRDC). The 6th Respondent

has thereafter continued with his development activities. He would not have

reasonably expected that the 1st Petitioner would maintain his objections

thereafter. In these circumstances, it is the view of this Court that there is

no justification for the 1st Petitioner to raise his concerns about the

environment, 07 years after he had agreed that the 6th Respondent is free

to develop this land, subject to the previously mentioned condition. If he

raised these issues in the year 2009 itself, the 6th Respondent could have

considered even halting his operations.

Time and again, this Court has held that undue delay is a factor upon which

a writ application could be refused.

The Petitioners have not adduced any explanation as to why they have failed

to take any steps to challenge the relevant issues at the proper time. Thus,

10

the Petitioner is guilty of inordinate delay, which calls for the dismissal of

this application on that ground alone.

In view of this situation, it is the view of this Court that it would not be

necessary for this Court to consider in detail the other issues raised on behalf

of the Petitioner.

The jurisdiction to issue writs in the nature of certiorari and Mandamus which

is vested in this Court by virtue of Article 140 of the constitution is a

jurisdiction, which this Court could decide in its discretion to exercise only in

a fit case. For the reasons set out above, this Court is of the view that this

is not a fit case in which this Court should exercise its writ jurisdiction. Hence,

this Court decides to dismiss this application without costs. ,
