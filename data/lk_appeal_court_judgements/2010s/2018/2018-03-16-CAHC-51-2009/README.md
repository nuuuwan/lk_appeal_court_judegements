The Accused - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was indicted

in the High Court of Colombo on 09.l2.2005 for having in possession 17.3

(PW6) and Police Constable Sanath (PW2) was led on behalf of the prosecution

and the prosecution closed its case.

In brief the case for the prosecution was that the Appellant was arrested

consequent to a raid conducted pursuant to information provided by a personal

informant to PW2. He had received a tipoff that a drug transaction was to take

place between 1800 - 1900 hours of the day in an area called 'Kimbulaela' and

as such PW 1 dispatched a team to conduct the raid. The said team had then

apprehended the Appellant when he returned to the three-wheeler in which he

arrived at the scene. When the Appellant was searched the team had recovered

102 grams of Heroin in his pocket.

The Appellant opted to make a dock statement on 08.12.2008 and took up the

position that the Appellant was arrested in a raid intended originally for two

other suspects. The Appellant stated that the Accused was at a bus stop in

'Kimbulaela' junction, when a group of officers arrested him for being

acquainted with the two suspects who they originally came to arrest. The

Appellant further stated that the Police failed to arrest the said suspects who fled

away from the scene throwing away the drugs in their possession and since the

Appellant was unable to provide information pertaining to those who fled away,

the Police Officers had introduced the discarded drugs to the Appellant falsely

implicating him.

The learned High Court Judge delivered judgment dated 24.03.2009 and found

the Appellant guilty of the said charge and thereafter sentenced him to life

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant preferred the

instant Appeal seeking to set aside the impugned judgment dated 24.03.2009 ,

mainly on the following grounds;

" a) The learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate that the serious

infirmities in the investigation ought to have cast doubt on the case for

the prosecution,

b) The learned High Court Judge has failed to offer due regard to the case of

the Defence.

I shall now consider the first ground of Appeal urged by the learned Counsel for

the Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant argues that the prosecution has failed to

explain why the narcotics officers had apprehended the Appellant and thereafter

proceeded to travel around 20km to search the Appellants house but have not

done so as the lady of the house (the Appellants wife) was not at home.

It is prudent to note that as per the narration of the prosecution the informant

had provided information to the effect that the Appellant should not be arrested

upon arriving at the 'Kimbulaela' junction but after he has engaged in a drug

transaction somewhere in the vicinity and only after he comes back to the three-

wheeler on which he arrived (vide page 64 of the Appeal brief). As per the

version of the prosecution the Appellant was apprehended by the Police team

who thereafter proceeded to travel to the Appellant's house to search the

premises. It is reasonable to question the rational of the decision taken by the

Police Team to travel around 20 kilometers from the point of arrest and away

5

from the location where heroin was peddled, to search albeit unsuccessfully, the

Appellants house.

The learned Senior State Counsel contends that in terms of Section 77(2) of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984 in a situation

where a search warrant cannot be obtained under Section 77(1) any Police

Officer not below the rank of sergeant, without affording the offender an

opportunity of escape or concealing evidence of the offence within 12 hours

exercise all or any powers of conferred on him by subsection (1). The learned

SSC submits that the fact that the Appellant was in Police custody at the time of

the attempted search there was no chance of him escaping or concealing

evidence and as such the Police could not have searched the house without a

search warrant and therefore that the reason for not searching the house of the

Appellant does not affect the credibility of the case for the prosecution.

In the case of Wickremasuriya v. Dedoleena and others 1996 (2) SLR 95 it

was held that;

"A Judge, in applying the Test of Probability and Improbability relies

heavily on his knowledge of men and matters and the patterns of conduct

observed by human beings both ingenious as well as those who are less

talented and fortunate."

In the instant Appeal if the Appellant had allegedly purchased heroin from the

'Kimbulaela' junction area, would it not ensue that a thorough search of the

vicinity would have been more productive than a futile attempt at searching the

Appellants house? Further, if the Appellant had come to the 'Kimbulaela'

junction to purchase heroin one can assume that the Appellant had no heroin at

6

his house, if so what did the Police hope to find at the Appellants house? This

Court finds that the narration of the prosecution is improbable in this regard.

This Court agrees with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Appellant

that the evidence does not reveal any attempt made by the officers to ascertain

the source of the narcotics, neither does the evidence reveal whether the accused

was even questioned as to the origin of the narcotics in question.

Further, another infirmity in the prosecution's case is the failure on part of the

prosecution to call the three-wheel driver who had allegedly driven the

Appellant to the 'Kimbulaela' junction who was also arrested by the Police

team but was later released. Though it's not necessary for the prosecution to call

a certain number of witnesses to prove a fact, in cases where an accused is

charged with an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment Court must

proceed with caution and must scrutinize the evidence diligently as a man's

liberty is at stake.

In the case of Sinnaiya Kalidasa vs. The Hon . Attorney General CA 128 /

2005 BASL Criminal Law 2010 Vol. 111 page 31 in which Ranjith Silva J

quotes E.S.R. Coomaraswamy in the Law of Evidence Volume 2 Book 1 at

page 395 dealing with how police evidence in bribery cases should be

considered;

"In the great many cases, the police are, as a rule unreliable witnesses. It

is all ways in their interests to secure a conviction in the hope of getting a

reward. Such evidence ought, therefore, to be received with great caution

and should be closely scrutinized."

7

Ranjith Silva J states;

"By the same token the same principles should apply and guide the

judges in the assessment of the evidence of excise officers in narcotic

cases. Judges must not rely on a non -existent presumption of

truthfulness and regularity as regards the evidence of such trained Police

or excise officers."

The second ground of Appeal urged by the leaned Counsel for the Appellant is

that the learned Trial Judge has failed to give due regard to the case of the

Defence. The learned Counsel submits that it seems that the learned High Court

Judge was pre-determined from the very inception of the case.

The learned Counsel submits three material points in this regard;

a) The learned Trial Judge first found that the case for the defence was

weak (vide page 185 of the Appeal brief) on the mere finding that the

pocket note book of Sanath does not reflect what was suggested to the

witness by the defence.

b) The learned Trial Judge has erroneously concluded that the Government

Analyst has come to the conclusion that there was no sand in the sample

when in fact the Government Analyst has testified that the test would not

reveal whether there was sand in the sample.

c) Although the defence has not specifically taken up the position that the

Accused has called the other two suspects by name which led to his

subsequent arrest this had not deprived the Court of the opportunity to

8

know the stance of the prosecution with regard to such position by the

defence.

With regard to the 1 st and 2nd point above a perusal of the impugned judgment

reveals that the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant stands true.

As per the 3rd material point it is evident that the defence has consistently

suggested to the prosecution witnesses that the arresting officers had realised

that the Appellant was aquatinted to two other suspects who had heroin in their

possession and since they had run away throwing the parcel of heroin on the

ground the officers had thereafter introduced the said parcel to the Appellants

possession and arrested him.

This Court finds that the infirmities in the case for the prosecution taken

together with the dock statement made by the Appellant is sufficient to raise a

reasonable doubt as to the culpability of the Appellant for the offence charged in

which he has been sentenced to life.

In the circumstances as more fully discussed above this appeal is allowed and we

set aside the conviction and sentence of the learned Trial Judge and the Accused

- Appellant is hereby acquitted.

Appeal Allowed.
