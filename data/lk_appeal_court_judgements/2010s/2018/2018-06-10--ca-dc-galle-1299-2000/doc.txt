T

he Plaintiff~ Respondent~ Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Plaintiff") instituted this action against the Defendant~Petitioner~Appeliant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") praying inter alia for

a) ejectment of the Defendant and all those holding under him from the shop and

premises more fully described in the schedule to the plaint and for delivery of

vacant possession of the premises in suit to the Plaintiff; 2

b) recovery of arrears of lease rentals in respect of the subject-matter up to the end

of May 1977 in a sum of Rs.23,300/-;

c) damages at the rate of Rs.500/- per month from 10.06.1997 until delivery of

vacant possession of the property to the Plaintiff.

The Defendant filed answer denying a cause of action and prayed, inter alia, for a

dismissal of the action.

When the case came up for trial on 01.10.1998, the Defendant was absent and Mr.

Sarath Manamperi Attorney-at-Law on behalf of the instructing Attorney Sagara

Manamperi informed Court that there were no instructions from the Defendant-see

Senanayake v. Cooray 15 N.LR 36-on the day fixed for the trial of this case, the

Defendant was absent and his proctor on the record, who was present in Court, stated

he had no instructions.

It was held that the physical presence of the proctor in the Court, coupled with what

he said on the trial day, did not constitute an appearance for the Defendant which

would give the proceedings the character of an inter partes trial which would enable the

Judge to enter a final decree.

In the appeal before me, the learned District Judge began the ex parte trial and delivered

his judgment awarding the reliefs prayed for in the plaint, after having heard the

testimony of the Plaintiff.

Upon the ex parte decree being served on the Defendant, the Defendant moved Court to

have the judgment vacated and the case fixed for trial inter partes. The Defendant had,

along with his petition and affidavit dated 03.12.1999, submitted a copy of a medical

certificate issued by an Ayurvedic physician. When the purge-default inquiry came up

on 21.08.2000, the Defendant moved for a date to summon the Ayurvedic doctor who

had issued the medical certificate.

There were submissions made on behalf of the Plaintiff namely, there was a failure to

serve notice of the application on the Attorney-at-Law of the Plaintiff. There was also

3

an argument that the Defendant had not listed the A yurvedic physician as a witness.

The submissions have also been relied upon by the learned District Judge to refuse the

application of the Defendant to summon the Ayurvedic physician to testify on behalf of

the Defendant. As a result the Defendant alone gave evidence in order to discharge his

onus to furnish reasonable grounds for his default on Ol.lO.l999~a requirement imposed

by Section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. It is not inapposite to repeat certain well~

known principles that should guide purge~default inquiries.

1) An inquiry on an application to set aside an ex parte decree is not regulated by any

specific provisions of the cpc. Such enquiries must be conducted consistently

with the principles of natural justice and requirements of fairness. Section 839 of

the CPC recognises the inherent power of the court to make an order as may be

necessary for the ends of justice.

De Fonseka v. Dharmawardene (1994) 3 Sri LR. 49

2) Applications to set aside ex parte decrees are proceedings incidental to and not a

trial proper. The inquiry must be conducted on principles of fairness.

Wimalawathie and Others v. Thotamuna (1998) 3 Sri LR. 1

3) a) the language used in Section 86(2) of the CPC does not seem to suggest that

the Defendant is reqUired to give notice of his application to the Plaintiff

simultaneously with the filing of such application.

b) the notice of the application can be given subsequently.

Karunadasa v. Rev. Phillips (2003) 2 Sri LR.140

I must observe that if the learned District Judge of Galle had borne in mind the

aforesaid principles, he would not have erred in refusing the application of the

Defendant to summon the Ayurvedic physician who had allegedly issued the medical

certificate. In fact, this refusal was urged by the Counsel for the Defendant as a ground

to vitiate the judgment that the learned District Judge had delivered refusing the

application to vacate the ex parte judgment and decree. But I pause to pose one poser.

4

No doubt, the testimony of the Ayurvedic physician, if at all, could have corroborated

the evidence of the Defendant at the purge/default inquiry.

Despite the error of the learned District Judge, the question is how convincing the

Defendant was in the first instance in furnishing reasonable grounds for his default in

appearance.

It is axiomatic that the Defendant, in his application to set aside the ex parte decree,

must give satisfactory reasons for his default. In a purge/default inquiry, it is incumbent

on the District Judge to ascertain whether the reasons given by the Defendant are

reasonable and satisfactory for the vacation of the ex parte decree. If the court is satisfied

it would set aside the decree and permit the Defendant to proceed with this defence

from the stage of default.

So the question is how qualitatively good the evidence of the Defendant was as to why

he was unable to be present in court on 01.1O.l998/the day the ex parte trial was held. It

is not the number of witnesses that matters but the quality of evidence/see Mulwa v.

State of Madya Pradesh AIR 1976 S.C 989 at para 18; Balraj v. State of Panjab (1976)

Cr.lJ, 1471 at para 19; Vadivelu Thevar v. State of Madras AIR (1957) 614, (1957)

Cri.lJ 1000 and P.P. Fatima v. State ofKerala (2004) SCC (Crim) 1. These cases are to

the effect that evidence has to be weighed but not counted. Even in England this holds true

exemplified in the legal maxim testes ponderantur, non/numerantur /see the English cases

such as D.P.P. v. Hester (1972) 57 Cr.A.R. 212 at 242 per lord Diplock; Wright v.

Tatham (1838) 5 Cl &: F. 670; Phipson, Law of Evidence, 13th Edition, para.32/0l, p.717. A

Court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness even though it is

uncorroborated. Regardless of the nature of the trial, civil or criminal see also Section

134 of the Evidence Ordinance which embodies the above maxim to the effect that no

particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.

' .... I

Defendant's testimony at the purge~default inquiry

The Defendant testified that on the day prior to the date of trial he had a fall which

resulted in an injury to his foot and he was in an excruciating pain and owing to the

mishap he could not attend court on 01.10.1998. He had to seek medical treatment from

an Ayurvedic doctor on that day. He had travelled in a three wheeler with his wife and

child for one and a half mile to seek the medical help. It was with a dislocation of his

foot he saw the doctor in the morning of 01.10.1998. In the same breath the Defendant

admitted that he visited the bookie that he was operating in the shop premises in the

evening of the same date namely 01.10.1998.

In cross~examination the Defendant was shown a betting chit, which he admitted to

have issued on O1.10.1998~the trial date (see page 45 of the appeal brief). When he was

confronted with the betting chit, he remained silent (see page 47).

When the Defendant was asked as to when he issued the chit, he responded that it was

in the evening of 01.1O.1998,the date of the trial but yet he said he had been unconscious

till evening and was lying at the doctor's clinic till evening. Come evening he had

regained consciousness and began to work at his bookie. This is inherently improbable

and does not inspire confidence in his testimony. Here was a witness who asserted that

he had become unconscious owing to the fall and dislocation of his foot but in the

evening he was seen engaging in issuing chits in the course of his betting business. This

is also in stark contrast to his admission that he was aware that his case was coming up

on 01.10.1998.

It is inconceivable that a hterate person as the Defendant was could have forgotten to

inform his Attorney~at~Law that a calamity had befallen him. He could have sought the

assistance of his wife or child to convey the news of the sudden emergency so that the

Attorney~at~Law could have moved for an adjournment of the trial. The Attomey,at,

Law did intimate to Court that he had no instructions from the Defendant.

It is intrinsically imponderable that a person whose ankle was dislocated was able to

visit his bookie and transact business when a person in his condition was wont to

6

~ ." 1

suffer the consequence of immobilisation for a couple of days. I cannot fault the learned

District Judge for having disbelieved the witness with regard to the reasons that he

proffered for non-appearance on 01.10.1998.

The testimony of this witness could not have been improved by the evidence of the

Ayurvedic physician. I take the view that the evidence of the Defendant does not afford

any foundation to inspire confidence in his account, and I conclude that there were no

reasonable grounds for his default so that the judgment and decree dated 01.10.1998

could be set aside.

I must advert to some legal submissions Mr. Shyamal Collure made in the course of his

argument. He contended that the Plaintiff had not averred in the plaint that he was the

owner of the premises in suit and also when and on what conditions he had entered

into the alleged lease agreement. He had failed to establish his ownership of the

premises. He also submitted that the alleged lease agreement was not before Court. The

upshot of this argument was that the ex parte judgment dated 01.10.1998 and decree are

based on no evidence and cannot stand in law.

It is indubitable that Section 85(1) of the CPC requires that the trial Judge should be

satisfied that the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed. In fact in Sirmavo

Bandaranaike v. Times of Ceylon limited (1995) 1 Sri LR. 22, the Supreme Court

declared that in an ex parte trial, the trial Judge must act according to law and ensure

that the relief claimed is due in fact and in law and must dismiss the plaintiff's action if

he is not entitled to it. In the same vein Kulatunga J. opined in Sheila Seneviratne v.

Shereen Dharmaratne (1997) 1 Sri LR. 76, that an ex parte judgment cannot be based on

hearsay evidence and set aside the ex parte judgment and decree. Thus there was an

invitation to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction to reach out to the ex parte judgment

and decree and set it aside on the basis that there was no evidence at all to hold that the

Plaintiff was entitled to his reliefs. Ex parte orders made by Courts have indeed been set

aside in revision applications-sec Sirmavo Bandaranaike v. Times of Ceylon limited

7

. , . .

(supra); In fact Garnini Amaratunga J. held in Attorney General v. Casman Herath c.A.

Rev. 2060/2004, D.C. Colombo 6842/M, c.A. minute dated 12.11.2004):

"The existence of the appeal was not an impediment to the filing of a simultaneous revision

application to canvass the ex~parte judgment on its merits."

I am afraid that I would be slow to indulge in that exercise as I am disinclined to

exercise the revisionary jurisdiction for the follOwing reasons. Even in the purge~default

enquiry, there was a tacit admission on the part of the Defendant that he had been in

arrears of lease rentals for many years. His silence in the face of the question on arrears

of lease rentals, is indicative of the fact that he had been defaulting in payment of rents

which he owed the Plaintiff. Nowhere does the Defendant throw a challenge that he

did not owe the rentals to the Plaintiff. Thus there was an implied acceptance that the

Plaintiff was the landlord, if not the owner. It is trite law that a non owner of a building

can be the landlord ~see Sharvananda, CJ in ImhuJdeniya v. De Silva (1987) 1 Sri L.R.

367.

The Plaintiff asserted in his evidence at the ex parte trial that he had leased the shop and

premises to the Defendant who later fell into arrears. There was no denial of ownership

nor was there a repudiation of the landlordship of the Plaintiff in the petition and

affidavit that the Defendant filed in terms of Section 86(2) of the CPC in order to have

the ex parte judgment vacated (see page 73 of the appeal brief). It would appear that

even a letter dated 1O.06.l997 marked as PI at the ex parte trial, that had been sent to the

Defendant, quite clearly stated that the Plaintiff was the lessor who had let the

premises to the Defendant and this letter sent through an Attorney~at~Law terminated

the lease agreement.

Thus there was admittedly a relationship of lessor and lessee between the parties,

which has not been repudiated by the Defendant. No hearsay evidence or inadmissible

evidence has been led at the ex parte trial. Therefore, this is not a case that lends itself to

the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

t." )

Moreover, Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance would estop the Defendant from

denying the title of the Plaintiff qua an owner or a landlord of the premises. Section 116

of the Evidence Ordinance goes as follows:-

"No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such tenant, shall during the

continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the

beginning of the tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and

No person who came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in possession

thereof shall be permitted do deny that such person had a title to such possession at the time

when such licence was given."

This provision embodies a case of estoppel by contract. The principle underlying the

section was stated by Jessel, M.R in Shaw v. Jones Ford (1877) 6 C.D 1 at 9;

"He took possession under a contract to pay the rent as long as he held possession under the

landlord, and to give it up at the end of the term to the landlord; and having taken it in that way,

he is not allowed to say that the landlord did not have title."

In the Indian case of Bilas Kunwar v. Desraj Ranjit Singh (1915) ILR 37 All 557, the

Privy Council observed:

"A tenant who has been let into possession cannot deny his landlord's title, however defective it

may be, so long as he has not openly restored possession by surrender to his landlord."

Out courts too have endorsed the principle that in a suit against a licensee or a lessee,

title is irrelevant-see the perceptive judgment of U. De Z. Gunawardana, J. in Ruberu

and Another v. Wijesooriya (1998) 1 Sri LR. 58.

Therefore the argument that the Plaintiff should have led evidence of ownership is

bound to fail as there is evidence in the case to raise the irrebuttable presumption

under Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance.

, .

In the circumstances I proceed to affirm the judgment dated 16.10.2000 and as a result

the ex parte judgment dated 01.10.1998 would stand. Accordingly I dismiss the appeal of

the Defendant/Appellant with costs.
