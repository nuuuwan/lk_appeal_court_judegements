c) A \Vrit of Mandamus directing the 2nd -4th Respondents to issue the

Petii.ic':ler a 'state grant' in terms of the Land Devek1pment Ordinance.

The PetitionE.r is the eldest son of Alpiti Badalage Wijehamy and Manamendra

Patabendi~-e Podihamy. The 1st Respondent is a ynunger brother of the

Petitioner. The Petitioner states that a permit had been granted by the State

under the Land Development Ordinance to Wijehamy in 1955 in respect of a

land in extent of approximately 4 (Jcres. The said land has been identified in

the Tenem,~nt Lists produced with the petition marked 'P2A' and 'P3A' as Lot

No. 218 of Plan No. ISPP No. 152 and Lot No. 253 of Plan No. ISPP 143 The

Petitioner claims that Wijehamy had nominated the Petitioner uS the

successor, in terms of the Land DevelDpment Ordinance. However, a copy of

the said permit issued to Wijehamy or documentary proof of such nomination

of the Petitioner have not been produced to this Court.

In 1999, while Wijehamy was living, two permits, annexed to the petition

marked 'P4' and IpS' had been issued by the State under Section 19(2) of the

Land Development Ordinance in respect of the aforementioned lots of land, to

Podihamy.

According to the Petitioner, soon after receiving the permits, Podihamy had

nominated all her children as her successors under the permit 'P4'. However,

due to the restrictions contained in Condition Nos. 4, 5 and 6 of 'P4', Podihamy

had subsequently amended the nomination and nominated only the 1st

Respondent, as borne out by the copy of the permit annexed to the .petition,

marked 'P4a'. According to the 1st Respondent, Podihamy hJd nominated the

1 st Respondent as her successor under the permit 'PS', as well, which position . -

ha~~ heen disputed by the Petitioner.

After the demise of Podihamy in 2006 and Wijehamy in 2007, it appears that

dispL tes arose between their children over this land. This is borne out by d

letter dated 25th August 20084 by which the 3rd Respondent had requested the

Petitioner to participate at a mobile service that was to be held on 28th August

2008 to resolve land disputes and the letter dated ih January 20095 sent by

the ,jrd Respondent to the Officer in Charge of the Kandaketiya Police Station.

Subsequent to the said mobile service, the 3rd Respondent hJd sent letter

d()ted 18th March 20096 to all the chiluren of Wijehumy and Podihamy

including the Petitioner informing that a survey of the said land would be

carried out, to give effect to the decision m()de by the 4th Respondent at the

mo~ile service. However, the Petitioner had objected to the said survey being

carried out and no steps have been taken in that regard thereafter.

The Petitioner in the meantime had written to the Land Commissioner

General7 requesting that he should be recognised as the successor of

Podihamy as hE.: is the eldest son. The Petitioner had written several other

letters thereafter to the 4th Respondent requesting thJt a permit be issued to

him in respect of the en-tire land. By letter dated 20th June 20128, the 3rd

Respondent had written to all the children of Wijehamy and Podihamy informing them as follows:

~)O~ii)~e> t;,eDeJ@."

However, it does not appear that the children of Wijchamy and Podihamy

were able to reCJch any agreelller.t en the division cf [he said land among

themselves.

It is in this factual buckground that the 3rd Respondent sent the letter dated 6th

July 2014 annexed to the petition marked 'pg' to the 4th Respondent. By 'pg',

the 3rd Respondent has set out the sequence of events, the background

circumstances relating to the issuing of the permits to 'Podihamy and the fact

that steps are being taken to grant a permit to the 1st Respondent as he is the

successor of Podihamy, under the Permits 'P4' and 'PS'.

Being dissatisfied with the con~ents of 'pg' on the basis that it is factually

incorrect, the Petitioner has filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to

quash 'pg,9. The Petitioner is also seeking a Writ of Mandamus on the 2nd - 4th

Respondents directing them to take steps to issue the Petitioner a 'st<:lte grant'

in respect of the said land. The basis of the Petitioner's claim for a Mandamus

9 The 3rd Respondent has admitted in his Ciffidavit tendered to this Court that the statement in 'P8' that Podihamy became the permit holder due to the death of Wijehamy is an inadvertent error. In any event, this statement is irrelevant in the light of the conclusion reached by this Court that the Petitioner is estopf:;cd from challenging the validity of 'P4' and 'PS' at this stage.

is that the Petitioner has been named uS .the original successor of Wijehamy

under a permit which is still valid iJ:ld that in any event, being the eldest son of

Wijehamy, he is entitled to succeed to the rights of Wijehamy.

Although the Petitioner hlls net sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

permits 'P4' and 'PS' issued to Podihamy, in effect, the Petitioner is challenging

the validity of the two permits 'P4' and 'PS' on the basis th<Jt the said two

permits 'P4' und 'PS' could not have been issued without cancelling the permit

issued to Wijeharny and are therefore void ab initio. Therefore, in order to

succeed in this application, the Petitioner must prove that the permit issued to

Wijehumy is valid and that the subsequent permits 'P4' and 'PS' are illegal und

does not affect the validity of the permit 'issued to Wijehamy.

At the outset, this Court must note that no evidencp. has been presented by

any party with regard to the precise circumstances under which the said

permits were issued to Podihamy. Nor has the Petitioner adduced any material

to prove that the permit issued to Wijehamy had not been cancelled, prior to

issuing the permits Ip4' and 'PS' to Podihamy. Therefore, the validity of the

permits issued to Wijehamy and Podihamy will have to be considered in the

light of the material presented by the parties to this Court.

This Court has considered the documents filed by the Petitioner and the 1st

Respondent ;)nd is of the view thf1t the challenge mounted by the Petitioner to

'P4' and 'PS' must fail, for the following three reasons.

First, if the Petitioner was dissatisfied with the issuing of the permits 'P4' clild

'PS', he ought to hove chLlllenged 'P4' LInd 'PS' at the time it was issued in

6

7

1999. The Petitioner has not produced any material to this Court to demonstrClte that either he or the previcu~ permit holder Wijehamy or any

other children of Wijehamy had challenged the issuing cf the permits 'P4' and

'PS', until the filing of this application.

In the letter dated ih January 2009 sent by the 3rd Respondent to the Officer in

Charge of the Kandekatiya Police Station10 with copy to the Petitioner, the 3rd

Respondent specifically refers to permits having been issued to Podihamy. If

this was not the case and the permit is~ued to Wijehamy was still valid, the

Petitioner ought to h,we raised issue with the said claim of the 3rd Respondent.

The Petitioner hiJS not produced any material to this Court to establish that he

challenged this po;ition taken by the 3r~ Respondent. In thi.s background, this

Court is of the view that this is a clear indication that the Petitioner had no

dispute with the issuing of the permits 'P4' and 'P2'.

The second and more important reason is that the Petitioner has sought to

aSJert rights under the permits 'P4' and 'PS', thus demonstratine that the

permit issued to Wijehamy is no longer valid and that he accepts the validity of

'P4' and 'P5.'. This is clearly borne out by the letter dated 16th March 2009,

annexed to the petition marked 'P7c' written by the Petitioner to the 4th

Respondent Commissioner General of Lands, the relevant portions of which

are re-produced below:

Having sought to claim succession under the permits issued to Podihamy, this

Court is of the view that the PetitiGner is estopped from t()king a contrary

position at this stage with regard to the validity of 'P4' and IpS' and presenting

a case to succeed under the permit issued to WijehJmy. In these

c;rcul,lstdnces, the Petitioner C2nnot be he<Jrd to say thJt the permit issued to

WijehCJmy is valid and therefore, this Court is of the view that the basis cf the

Petitioners case does not have any merit.

The third reason why the Petitioner cannot challenge the validity of the

rermits 'P4' and IpS' is thnt Wijehamy himself hJd admitted by a letter dated

21st November 2005 the issuing of the permits 'P4' and IpS' in favour of

Podihamy.ll This letter signed by vVijehamy who describes himself as @fi)@ ~@

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner hJS failed

to estuolish that the perm;t issued to Wij:;liJmy is valid and rejects the

argument of the Petitioner that he is entitled to be issued a permit under the

provisions of the Land Developme'1t Ordinance under the said permit. The

issuing of the Writ of M~!ndamus prayed for therefore does not arise.

The next question th<:t needs to be considered by this Court is whether the

nomination of the 1st Respondent by Podihamy is illegal or invalid. This is in

view of the fact that the Petitioner, by virtue of being the eldest son, would be

entitled to succeed under the permits 'P4' and 'PS', in the absence of a valid

nomination by Podihamy.

As set out above, Podihamy had initially nominated all her children as her

successors under the permit 'P4'. Subsequently, this nomination has been

()mended by nominating only the 1st Respondent - vide 'P4a'. There can be no

dispute with regard to the nomination in 'P4a', as the nomination has been

done in the presence of the Divisional Secretary. The Peti~ioner disputes the

nomination of the 1st Respondent in IpS' Oil the premi~e that Podihamy's

signature does not appear on 'PS' and therefore that there is no valid

nomination. However, this position appears to be incorrect when one

9

10

considers the copy of the permit 'PS' produceJ by the 1st Respondene2, which -.

clearly shows a thumb impres.s;on said to be that cF Podihamy (Jffixed in the

presence of the Divisionz.1 Secretary. Therefore, on the face of the material

produced to this Court, this Court does not see any merit in the claim of the

Petitioner that Podihamy r.as net named Cl succes::..Ir under the permits 'P4'

and 'PS'.

In these circumstances, this Court does not find that the contents of 'PS' are

illegal or irration<J1 and therefore: holds that the argument of the Petitioner~h(.;t

'PS' is based on incorrect facts is misconceived. This Court is therefore of the

view tn()t the Petitioner is net entitled to the Writ of Certiorari prayed for. A

fortiori the Petitioner is not entitled to the Writ of Prohibition r:;rayed for.

It is trite bw thtlt ~l petitioner seeking a writ of Mundamus must demonstrate

thtlt hE has (J legal. right to the performance of a lEgal duty by the .respondents.

Where a valid nomination of a successor under a permit is~ued under the Land

Development Ordinance has bEen made in terms of the said Ordinance, none

of the other children can claim an entitlement to the said land. Thus, the

Petitioner cannot claim any rights under 'P4' and 'PS'. In the circumstances of

this Ctlse, the Petitioner has no legal right to be issued a permit under the

provisions of the Land Development OrcJini.1nce nor are the 2nd -4th

Respondents under any IE:g,ll duty in terms of the l(Jw to issue the Petitioner a

permit in respect of the said It:.nd. Hence, this Court is of the view that the

Petit:oner is not entitled to the writ of mandamus prayed for.
