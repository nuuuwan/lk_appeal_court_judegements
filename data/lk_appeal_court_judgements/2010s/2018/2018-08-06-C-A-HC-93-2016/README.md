The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Matara for robbery

of Rs. 23,65,262/47 from an employee of the Commercial Bank of Matara

whilst attempting to cause death or grievous hurt to the said person

punishable under section 383 read with section 32 and section 380 of the

Penal Code. After trial the appellant was convicted under section 380 and

sentenced to 7 years RI and a fine of Rs. 10,0001= was also imposed.

The prosecution story was that on the day in question around

eleven in the morning the appellant had entered the Bank along with the

The prosecution story was that on the day in question around

eleven in the morning the appellant had entered the Bank along with

thecustomers and had suddenly jumped over the counter and collected

the said sum of money from the cashiers while another person had been

holding the security officer at gun point. The appellant too had been

armed and all this had taken place within a very short time. The appellant

was identified at an identification parade by the security officer first after

two weeks and the Bank employees after four months at a consequent

parade. The incident had taken place in April 2003 and the second

identification parade was held in August 2003.

The learned president's counsel for the appellant argued that the

learned High Court Judge has not properly evaluated the evidence

thereby denied a fair trial to the appellant. He stated that the evidence of

the appellant was rejected by the learned High Court Judge on the basis

that he had not offered an explanation in the face of the prosecution

evidence. The learned counsel stated that according to the evidence of

the investigating police officers they were informed by some persons

working in an estate that two persons whom they identified by name were

seen running carrying a fertilizer sack, and that there is no evidence to

say that the appellants emptied the money into a fertilizer bag in fact the

3

evidence was that they emptied the money into a black plastic bag. He

further stated that the two persons identified by the witnesses had

bleeding injuries where as there was no evidence to say the appellant

was sustained bleeding injuries. The investigating officer has said there

was a motorcycle near a parapet wall and a person standing next to it

took to his heels when he saw the witness and he was arrested after

giving chase. The counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge

failed to consider this evidence which shows that the appellant was

framed without any evidence to implicate him. He also said that the whole

operation had taken only five minutes and the learned High Court Judge

has failed to consider whether in the circumstances the witnesses could

have made a proper identification under the conditions and whether it is

safe to act upon the identification made at a subsequent parade.

The appellant had informed the Magistrate when he was produced

for a parade that he was shown to the witnesses. The learned High Court

Judge has failed to give due consideration to this fact and also to consider

the evidence of witnesses who stated that they can not say with certainly

whether the person in the dock was the person who came to the bank on

that day.

The learned counsel for the respondent in his submissions stated

that the appellant was identified by the witness and that it should be noted

that the facts of the instant case are not representative of a case of

fleeting glance and that it involves a case where the appellant had

intruded the bank premises with a pistol.

Identification at a parade alone is not enough to convict a person.

In the instant case some of the witnesses have said they identified a

person who came to the bank at a parade but they are not sure whether

ifs the same person who is in the dock. (vide p.288 of the brief). Here the

test of consistency fails.

The appel/ants also argued that many matters that are in favour of

the appellant have not been given consideration by the leamed High

Court Judge. Instead inadmissible evidence prejudicial to the appellants

have been led and the learned High Court Judge has failed to state in his

judgment that he disregarded such evidence thus denying him a fair trial.

The leamed Additional Solicitor General for the respondent argued

that the appellants did not make a precise disclosure about the allegation

regarding the Identification parade in his dock statement. He also stated

5

that the instant case involves the testimony of eye witnesses. Hence the

principles enunciated in Ellenborough dictum should not be brought to

this case, since what matters is the eye witness testimony. But the said

eye witnesses were not certain whether the person they identified at the

identification parade was the same person they saw in the dock, in the

High Court.

The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the prosecution

failed to call as witness those who gave information to the police. They

have said a person carrying a fertilizer bag had run across the estate but

the bank witnesses have said the appellants emptied the money into a

black shopping bag.

The motorcycle recovered by the police officers had the same

registration number of the motorcycle in which the suspects escaped after

the robbery. The security officer at the bank has gave the number to the

police. But the police officers have, failed to trace the registered owner of

the motorcycle. They did not produce any documents regarding this

motorcycle. They failed to prove that the motorcycle recovered was the

motorcycle used for the robbery.

f .:

The investigating officers did not find any money alleged to have

been robbed from the Bank in the appellant's possession. There were no

productions in the High Court.

The learned High Court Judge has said the appellants failed to give

an explanation to court in his dock statement. An accused had to explain

his position to court when there is strong evidence against him led by the

prosecution to cast a doubt on the prosecution case. In the instant case

there is a doubt regarding the identification of the appellant. He was

produced for a parade after four months and he alleged he was shown to

the witnesses at the police station. Some of the witnesses giving

evidence have said that they are not sure whether it is the same person

they identified in the parade. This throws a grave doubt about the identity

of the appellant which had to be considered by the learned High Court

Judge.

The evidence of the police officers also contradicted on the

recovery of the motorcycle. Nothing was recovered from the possession

of the appellant. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

these facts in the judgment thus denying the appellant a fair trial.

.',.,,-

F or the afore stated reasons we decide to set aside the judgment

dated 25/04/2016 by the High Court of Matara, and allow the appeal.

Appellant is acquitted and appeal is allowed.
