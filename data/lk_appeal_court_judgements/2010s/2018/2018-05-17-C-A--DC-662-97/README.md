Janak De Silva J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) filed the above action in the District Court of Nuwara Eliya

claiming that he was the tenant of the premises described in the schedule to the plaint and that

he was unlawfully evicted by the pt, 2nd and 3rd Defendants. He prayed for a declaration that he

is the tenant of the said premises, ejection of the pt and 2nd Defendants from the said premises,

grant of vacant possession and damages.

The Pt, 2nd and 3rd Defendants denied that the Appellant was a tenant of the premises in dispute.

The case advanced by them during the trial was that the said premises belonged to the Ragala

Pradeshiya Sabha and that the said premises was used by the Lanka Jathika Estate Workers Union

as its Ragala Office and the Appellant was looking after the said office as a member of the said

Union.

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge of Nuwara Eliya dismissed the action and hence

this appeal by the Appellant.

The learned Additional District Judge concluded that the Appellant had failed to add the owner

of the premises in dispute as a party and as such the action was not properly constituted. It was

further held that the Appellant had failed to establish that he was a tenant of the premises in

dispute.

The Appellant admitted under cross examination that he was a tenant of the Ragala Pradeshiya

Sabha [Appeal Brief page 70]. However, he failed to adduce any evidence of a tenancy agreement

with the Ragala Pradeshiya Sabha. The receipts he tendered marked as ol.i, ol.2 and ol.3 to

establish payment of rent did not have the address of the premises in dispute. Further the said

receipts reflect payment made to the Nuwara Eliya Development Council. He admitted that the

premises in dispute was used as the Ragala office of the Lanka Jathika Estate Workers Union of

which he was a member. In the light of this evidence the learned Additional District Judge of

Nuwara Eliya held that the Appellant had failed to add the owner of the premises as a party as

well as failing to establish his tenancy.

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Additional District judge failed

to appreciate that the case of the Appellant is based on his status as a tenant to the premises in

dispute against trespassers which is possible in terms of section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance.

This in my view is an erroneous submission of law. Section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance deals

with a possessory action. The pleaded case of the Appellant was not a possessory action.

In Hariette v. Pathmasiri1 the Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether a co-owner

could sue a trespasser to have his title to an undivided share declared and for ejectment of the

trespasser from the whole land. The Court answered this question in the affirmative because the

owner of the undivided share has an interest in every part and portion of the land. However, S.N.

Silva J. (as he was then) held that:

liAs correctly submitted by learned President's Counsel for the Defendant the action being

one for declaration of title and possession, the burden was on the Plaintiff to establish his

title to the land which was in dispute. The action cannot be decided only on answers to

issues 3 and 4 which relate only to aspects of possession, as submitted by counsel for the

Appellant. The character and scope of a rei vindicatio action which involves the question

of title and rights pertaining to ownership is distinct from that of a possessory action. The

1 (1996) 1 Sri.L.R.358

4

Plaintiff's action as presently constituted should therefore be dismissed if she fails to

establish title and the right to possess the corpus pursuant to such ownership."2

I am ofthe view that the same reasoning applies to the instant case. The Appellant came to court

seeking a declaration that he is the tenant and sought eviction and grant of possession on the

basis of such declaration. Issue no. 1 specifically deals with the question of tenancy. Hence, it

was incumbent upon him to establish the necessary attributes of tenancy. He failed to do so.

Thereafter it is not open for him to plead that his action was a possessory action and that he

should be granted relief on that basis.

Rules of natural justice that have been woven into our civil procedural rules gives a defendant

the right to know the case against him so that he can plead his case accordingly. Where the

pleaded case of a plaintiff is sought to be changed so as to change the character of the action,

grave prejudice will be caused to the defendant if the court proceeds to grant relief on the

changed character of the action. For example, the defenses available to a defendant in a

possessory action differs from one based on tenancy. Court should not place a defendant in

jeopardy of not having an opportunity to forward defenses available in law by granting relief on

a different basis.

I am of the view that the learned Additional District Judge of Nuwara Eliya was correct in

concluding that the Appellant had failed to add the owner of the premises as a party as well as

failing to establish his tenancy.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned

Additional District Judge of Nuwara Eliya dated 12th August 1997.
