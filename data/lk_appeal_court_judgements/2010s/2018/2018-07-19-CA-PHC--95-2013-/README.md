The Petitioner-Appellant has filed this apf,.~al seeking to set aside the Judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge of Keralle under case No. 4456/Writ dated

14.05.2013.

Facts of the Case:

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) had borrowed a

sum of Rs. 620,0001- from the 1st Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the 1 st Respondent) payable at an interest of 22% and on a condition that the

Appellant would have to pay an interest of 26% if he defaults in repaying the loan.

Upon the failure of the Appellant to settle the said loan with legal interest, the 1 st

Respondent had initiated the arbitration proceedings to recover the same.

Accordingly the 3rd Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as' the 3rd

Respondent) had appointed the 2nd Respordent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the 2nd Respondent) as the arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration and on

17.03.2007, the arbitral award was madeiJY the said arbitrator. Being dissatisfied

by the said arbitral award, the Appellant had filed an appeal to the Commissioner

of Co-operative Development of Sabaragamuwa Province and the Commissioner

had made his order of appeal along with reasons.

Thereafter the Appellant had invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle under case No. 4456/writ to

quash the said decisions. Pronouncing the Judgment dated 14.05.2013, the Learned

High Court Judge had dismissed the writ application. Being aggrieved by the said

dismissal, the Appellant preferred an appeal in this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant in his written submission has submitted

that the I st Respondent had overcharged the interest from the Appellant in

contravention to the provisions of Constitution of the 1 st Respondent Co-operative

Society.

Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of the Constitu(on of the 1 st Respondent Society are of

vital importance in this regard.

Section 5.3.2 of the said Constitution read3 as follows;

"&~8 ~ ~etWJ 25)1Z5iezs) E)aJe~25'j ewf &~ E)aJe~Z5i ewf cO,bGJzs) ~C

Section 5.3.3 of the said Constitution reads as follows;

We observe that the 1 st Respondent had obtained a loan from Sanasa Development

Bank Limited at a rate of 18% material to the disputed loan and the said interest of

22% was permitted as per the Constitution of the 1st Respondent Society. It is

noteworthy that the Appellant had been ~. member of the executive committee of

the 1 st Respondent Society during the time of the said loan transaction and had

placed his signature to the minutes of the committee when the same loan was

approved (Page 190 of the brief). Therefore it is understood that he could have

withdrawn his approval if the interest to be charged was excessive.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant fjrther submitted that default payment by

the Appellant was not preferable for th~ arbitration but rather, was entitled to

institute an action in the District Court.

It is important to consider section 58 of the Corporative Societies Law No. 05 of

1972 (as amended), in order to ascertain whether the said dispute was preferable

for arbitration.

Section 58 (2): The Registrar may, on receipt of a reference under

subsection (l)-

(a) decide the dispute himself, or

(b) refer itfor disposa~ to an arbitrator or arbitrators.

(3) Any party aggrieved by the award of the arbitrator or arbitrators

may appeal therefrom to the Registrar within such period and in such

manner as may be prescribed by rules.

Accordingly, it is evident that the Registrar was empowered to refer the said

dispute to an arbitrator.

The Counsel for the Appellant averred that the 3rd Respondent had disallowed the

Appellant to make oral submissions in th.:. appeal of arbitral award. Section 58(4)

Corporative Societies Law reads as follows;

1

No party to any appeal made to the Registrar under subsection (3) shall be

entitled, either by himself or by any representative, to appear before and be

heard by the Registrar on such appeal.

Therefore, the 3rd Respondent had disallowed parties to make oral submissions

according to the aforesaid section. However we observe that both parties were

Page 6of8

considered in the appeal proceedings by \ Nay of written submissions (Page 152 of

the brief).

Further we observe that the Registrar/Conmissioner of Co-operative Development

" had stated reasons for the order of appeal along with calculations in his order dated

09.09.2011 and had reduced the interest from 22% to an interest of 16%.

In the case of K.K. Palitha Fernando v. The Registrar General and another

rCA Writ application No. 43/2012], it was stated that,

"The nature of a writ of certiorari and a writ of mandamus is explained in

Wade's Administrative Law, Ninth Edition. At page 602 it says "Certiorari

is used to bring up in to the High Court the decision of some inferior

tribunal or authority in order that i.t may be investigated. If the decision does

not pass the test, it is quashed - that is to say, it is declared completely

invalid, so that no need to respect it... "

! The Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle in the Judgment dated 14.05.2013 has

stated that,

Accordingly, we are of the view that the'Learned High Court Judge has correctly

considered the law and we see no reason to interfere with the Judgment dated

14.05.2013.

Therefore we affirm the Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of Keg aIle.

The Appeal is hereby dismissed without c'osts.
