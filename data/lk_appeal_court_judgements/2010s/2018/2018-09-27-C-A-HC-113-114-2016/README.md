ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants were indicted before the High

Court of Matara for committing the murder of one Kalinga Chandradasa on

or about 8th October 2006. After trial without a jury, the trial Court found

both the Accused-Appellants guilty of murder and were sentenced to

death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, both the

Accused-Appellants, although represented by two Counsel, raised similar

grounds of appeal. They relied on grounds of appeal that the trial Court

had failed to consider whether both Accused-Appellants were actuated by

a common murderous intention and it failed to consider the lesser

culpability of them on the basis of sudden fight. The 1st Accused-Appellant

2

had, in addition, raised further grounds of appeal during the hearing of

the appeal on the complaint that the items of evidence which are

favourable to him had not been considered by the trial Court and there

was no formal adoption of evidence.

In the circumstances, it is necessary to consider the evidence placed

before the trial Court by the prosecution.

At the time of the trial, the only eye witness to the incident,

Wickramage Gunapala's evidence was admitted under Section 33 of the

Evidence Ordinance and his deposition was read over before the Court.

Witness Thushara Champika, although not an eye witness to the incident,

provided some items of circumstantial evidence. Witness Niroshan is a son

of the deceased and is the person who provided the 1st information to

Police on the same night about the death of his father.

The prosecution case is that the deceased had arrived at the small

grocery shop run by Champika. He was then dragged on to the middle of

the road by the 1st Accused-Appellant. The 2nd Accused-Appellant also

arrived there. Both the Accused-Appellants are brothers. Two of the

Accused-Appellants have then assaulted the deceased. Then the 2nd

Accused-Appellant brought a bicycle air pump kept at the shop. When

witness Gunapala tried to intervene to prevent the assault on the deceased,

the 1st Accused-Appellant had pushed him away after uttering obscenities.

3

Due to fear of harm, witness Gunapala did not complain to authorities, but

conveyed what he saw to one Jayanatha at another funeral house, who in

turn passed that information to Niroshan.

When Niroshan arrived at the scene, he saw his father fallen on the

middle of the road and his motor bicycle was on top of him. He had

thereafter taken his father to Hospital, where his death was confirmed

upon admission.

The Police had recovered a broken bicycle air pump near the place

where the assault took place and noted that its pumping shaft was bent.

During the post mortem examination, 20 external injuries were

observed by the Consultant J.M.O. and 11 of them were lacerations in

addition to 7 abrasions. Except for the two injuries noted on the penis of

the deceased and two other injuries on his buttocks and thigh, all other

injuries were concentrated on the head and face area of the body of the

deceased.

Consultant J.M.O., Dr. L.B. M. Fernando, was of the opinion that the

injury Nos. 1 and 3 have resulted in the fracture of the skull and intruded

into the cranial cavity causing internal damage to the underlying brain

tissues and a significant force is needed to inflict such injuries. He was of

the opinion that the laceration could have occurred by assault with the

bicycle air pump and its shaft. He further testified the blood sample taken

4

from the body of the deceased was analysed and it showed that it

contained 75% of ethyl alcohol level in the blood.

The death was due to injuries to the skull and brain as a result of

blunt trauma. In the report issued by the GENETECH (marked P2), the

bicycle air pump had deceased's blood stains.

It is in the above quoted evidentiary background, the several

grounds of appeal needs to be considered.

The complaint of adoption of evidence by the 1st Accused-Appellant

has no merit as the learned High Court Judge who convicted both

Accused-Appellants, at the commencement of further trial before him,

clearly exercised his discretion conferred upon him under Section 48 of the

Judicature Act with no objection by the Accused-Appellants.

The ground of appeal based on lesser culpability as the evidence

revealed there was a "sudden fight" needs to be considered next.

In a recent judgment of this Court, the applicable principles in

relation to the plea of sudden fight was reconsidered. In CA 131/2000,

C.A.M. of 10.09.2008, de Abrew J held that in respect of exception 4 to

Section 294 of the Penal Code;

5

1/ in order to derive the benefit of this special exception,

the following ingredients will have to be fulfilled.

(a) The suddenness of the fight should be common to

all participants and should not be one sided where

one of the assailants with deliberate design to

exploit the situation wades in and launches an

assault.

(b) The quarrel should be sudden to all antagonists

generating instantaneous heat of passion under

the influence of which the offence is committed.

(c) The offender should not have an undue advantage

such as attacking a defenceless unarmed person

with a deadly weapon.

(d) The offender should not have acted in a cruel or

unusual manner such as dealing repeated stab

blows with great force on a defenceless adversary,

where the intention to kill is not the product of

passion generated instantaneously but more likely

springing from malice or vindictiveness. "

(emphasis original)

When the evidence of the prosecution is considered against the

principles as laid down in the said judgment, it is clear there was no

6

sudden fight but only a sudden attack on the deceased. The deceased has

arrived at the scene on his own and then the 1st Accused-Appellant

dragged him on to the middle of the road and assaulted him for no

apparent reason. The 2nd Accused-Appellant also joined with him. They

had some prior enmity against the deceased over an incident after

consuming alcohol. The deceased was heavily intoxicated at this time and

the use of the bicycle air pump and repeated blows on the head and face of

the deceased clearly negates the possibility of a lesser culpability on a plea

of sudden fight.

On the question of common intention, the 1st Accused-Appellant

heavily relied on an answer given by Champika that during the attack on

the deceased, he had said to the 2nd Accused-Appellant" are you trying to

kill him ?". According to the 1st Accused-Appellant, this is a clear instance

that he had no requisite common murderous intention that he shared with

the 2nd Accused-Appellant to be found guilty of murder.

However, upon a closer examination of the evidence reveals a

different picture. Witness Champika did not see the attack on the deceased.

He did not see even the 2nd Accused-Appellant taking the air pump from

his boutique. He had simply overheard some utterance. When his evidence

is considered it is noted that this particular witness, although not an eye

witness to the incident, gave evidence as if he witnessed the incident. That

appears to be his manner of speech. It is his evidence he could not

intervene to prevent the assault on the deceased due to his physical

7

disability and therefore he put up shutters to his shop when the attack on

the deceased had commenced and went into his house located adjacent to

the shop. He only knew that the Accused-Appellants were assaulting the

deceased. As the 2nd Accused-Appellant had the air pump, he thought it

was the 1st Accused-Appellant who uttered those words.

Evidence of witness Gunapala is clear on this aspect. He tried to

intervene during the attack but was chased away by the 1st Accused-

Appellant, after the 2nd Accused-Appellant picked up "something" from

the shop, which he later identified as the bicycle pump.

Obviously, Champika did not see Gunapala's intervention. He had

mistakenly attributed Gunapala's act of intervention to the 1st Accused-

Appellant. The continued role played by the 1st Accused-Appellant from

the initial stage of the attack on the deceased to the last, and then by

putting the motor cycle on to the body of the deceased, with the help of 2nd

Accused-Appellant clears any reasonable doubt as to the presence of

common murderous intention.

The line of cross examination adopted by the 1st Accused -Appellant

adds credence to this proposition. The question put to Champika was that it

was the 1st Accused-Appellant who prevented an attack on the deceased

on a previous occasion. Then in answer to that question Champika said the

words attributed to him. But the 1st Accused-Appellant persisted with his

8

I

question referring to the earlier incident and not the incident as a result of

which the death of the deceased was occurred. Thus, it is clear from the

evidence that the 1st Accused-Appellant's position put to the witness is

that it was on a previous incident he tried to prevent the attack and not at

that particular time.

Learned High Court Judge had reproduced this segment of evidence

in his judgment and yet decided that the 1st Accused-Appellant has shared

the common murderous intention with his brother. The repeated blows on

the head and face of the deceased with the air pump with significant force,

clearly established the murderous intention of the 2nd Accused-Appellant.

The applicable principles are clearly laid down in Raju and Others v

Attorney General (2003) 3 Sri L.R. 116, where it is stated that;

"In the case of King v Assappu 50 N.L.R. 324 Dias, J. sitting with

Nagalingam, J. and Gratiaen, J. held that in a case where the

question of common intention arises the Jury must be directed that -

(i) The case of each accused must be considered separately.

(ii) The accused must have been actuated by a common

intention with the doer of the act at the time the offence

was commi tted.

(iii) Common intention must not be confused with same or

similar intention entertained independently of each

other.

9

(iv) There must be evidence either direct or circumstantial

of pre- arrangement or some other evidence of common

intention.

(v) The mere fact of the presence of the accused at the time

of the offence is not necessarily evidence of common

intention.

Justice Sirimanne in the case of Punchi Banda v The Queen 74

N.L.R.494 refers to the legal principle laid down in King v Assappu

(supra) that a common murderous intention must be shared before a

person can be convicted of murder on an application of section 32 of

the Penal Code."

Thus, it is clear that the trial Court had correctly applied the relevant

legal principles in coming to its finding. Therefore, we affirm the

conviction and sentence imposed on the Accused-Appellants by the High

Court of Matara and accordingly proceeds to dismiss their appeal.
