The Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) filed this action against the Defendant-Appellant

(Defendant) claiming that the Defendant had unlawfully seized vehicle bearing no. 41 @ 5720

(Vehicle) which the Plaintiff possessed in terms of a hire purchase agreement no. H.P. 2340/90

(Agreement)(ol.l) entered into between the parties. He further stated that the said unlawful

1

, .

seizure was done while the Agreement was subsisting without his consent and in violation of

clause 13 of the Agreement and section 20 of the Consumer Credit Act No. 29 of 1982 (Act)

although he had by then paid more than 75% of the hire purchase price. The Plaintiff claimed

that after the unlawful seizure, the Defendant had sold the Vehicle to a third party and that

consequently the Plaintiff had suffered damages of Rs. 7,00,000/= and prayed for judgement in

the said sum.

The Defendant claimed that the Plaintiff had breached the Agreement by selling the Vehicle to

one R. Dayasena without the consent of the Defendant and that therefore the Defendant had

the right in terms of the Agreement and the Act to repossess the Vehicle. The Defendant

counter claimed in a sum of Rs. 137,484/38 as arrears of the hire purchase price.

The learned District Judge of Bandarawela held that the Defendant had seized the Vehicle

without recourse to an action and without lawfully terminating the Agreement even though by

the time of the seizure the Plaintiff had paid more than 75% of the hire purchase price. A sum

of Rs. 5,50,000/= was awarded as damages to the Plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the Defendant.

The learned President's Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff had breached

the Agreement by selling the Vehicle to one R. Dayasena without the consent of the Defendant

and therefore the Defendant had the right in terms of the Agreement and the Act to repossess

the Vehicle. He submitted that even where more than 75% of the hire purchase price has been

paid, section 20 of the Act is not engaged as the Vehicle was repossessed from a third party and

not from the possession of the hirer{Defendant). It is an interesting argument to consider.

However, that issue does not arise for consideration in view of my conclusions on whether the

Agreement was duly terminated prior to seizure of the Vehicle.

The parties also made lengthy submissions on whether the Agreement continued despite

several purported terminations by the Defendant when the Defendant continued to accept the

hire paid by the Plaintiff. Here again, I am of the view that this issue need not be considered, in

view of my conclusions on whether the Agreement was duly terminated prior to seizure of the

Vehicle.

There was no dispute between the parties that the Defendant had re-possessed the Vehicle. It

was also admitted that by the time the Vehicle was seized the Plaintiff had paid more than 75%

of the hire purchase price. However, there is no direct evidence as to the exact date on which

the vehicle was repossessed. The Defendant by letter dated 9.7.1993 (01.57) informed the

Plaintiff that they have repossessed the Vehicle. Hence at least by 9.7.1993 the Vehicle had

been seized.

There are only two provisions in the Agreement dealing with the right of the Owner (Plaintiff)

to re-possess the Vehicle. These are set out in clauses 13 (b) and (c) of the Agreement (01.1)

which reads as follows:

1/13. Where the hire under the Agreement is terminated then the Owner shall be

entitled

(b) to re-possess subject to the provisions of Section 16, 20 and 21 of the

said Act and subject to any contract to the contrary the Vehicle whose

seventy five per centum of hire purchase price has not been paid;

(c) subject to the provisions of Section 20 and Section 21 of the said Act to

recover possession of the Vehicle by action in Court."(emphasis added)

These provisions are substantially similar to the provisions in sections 19(b) and 19(c) of the

Act. Both these provisions clearly apply only where the Agreement has been duly terminated. It

is in this context that the learned District Judge held that that the Defendant had seized the

Vehicle without recourse to an action and without lawfully terminating the Agreement even

though by the time of the seizure the Plaintiff had paid more than 75% of the hire purchase

price. The question then is whether there was a valid termination of the Agreement before

9.7.1993. The Agreement and the Act is breached if the Vehicle was repossessed without

lawfully terminating the Agreement.

Clause 12 of the Agreement elucidates the right of the Owner (Defendant) to terminate the

Agreement. It deals with two situations.

Clause 12(1) deals with the situation where the hirer defaults more than once in the payment

of hire. This clause is substantially the same as section 18(1) of the Act. It reads as follows:

1/12. (1) In case the Hirer makes more than one default in the payment of hire as

provided in this agreement then subject to the provisions of the said Act and after giving

the Hirer notice in writing of not less than:

(a) one week in case where the hire is payable at weekly or lesser intervals; and

(b) two weeks in any other case

the Owners shall be entitled to terminate the hire under the Agreement by giving the

Hirer notice of termination in writing.

Provided that if the Hirer pays or tenders to the Owners the hire in arrear together with

such interest thereon as may be payable under the terms of this Agreement before the

expiry of the said period of one week or two weeks as the case may be the Owner shall

not be entitled to terminate the hire under the Agreement."

In L.B. Finance Ltd. v. Weligamage and Others1the Supreme Court held that section 18(1) of the

Act requires two notices to be given. The first notice is one that is required to be given when

the hirer makes more than one default. The subsequent sentence in section 18(1) of the Act

refers to the content of the said notice. The hirer is informed of a two-week period within

which he is expected to pay the amount overdue. The second notice is the notice of

termination which is the culmination of the process of termination of the hire purchase

agreement. Hence there must be two notices and the hirer must be given the full period

specified in the sub-section. The failure to do so will result in the notice been invalid. None can

contract outside the provisions of the Act. 2

The Plaintiff strived to establish that the requirements in section 18(1) of the Act and clause

12(1) of the Agreement were fulfilled by documents marked ol.51, ol.52, ol.53 and ol.54. I will

consider each of these documents to ascertain whether they do so.

ol.51 is a letter dated 6.11.1990 sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. It states that unless

within three (3) days from the date of letter arrears of the hire is paid the hire will terminate in

terms of clauses 13 and 14 of the Agreement. This notice has no validity in law as it fails to

comply with the two weeks' notice period stipulated in both clause 12(1) of the Agreement and

18(1) of the Act. ol.52 is a letter dated 24.12.1991 whereby the Plaintiff informs the Defendant

that the Agreement is terminated for non-payment of the hire. Hence ol.52 is a notice of

termination. But it has been sent without first sending a valid notice as required by clause 12(1)

of the Agreement and 18(1) of the Act. Accordingly, ol.52 has no force in law. This is the letter

that was referred to as due notice in letter marked ol.58 dated 22.7.1993 sent by the attorney-

at-law for the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

ol.53 is a letter dated 5.10.1992 sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. It states that unless

within three (3) days from the date of letter arrears of the hire is paid the hire will terminate in

terms of clauses 13 and 14 of the Agreement. This notice has no validity in law as it fails to

comply with the two weeks' notice period stipulated in both clause 12(1) of the Agreement and

18(1) of the Act. ol.54 is a letter dated 2.12.1992 sent by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. It

states that unless within three (3) days from the date of letter arrears of the hire is paid the hire

will terminate in terms of clauses 13 and 14 of the Agreement. This notice has no force in law as

it fails to comply with the two weeks' notice period stipulated in both clause 12(1) of the

Agreement and 18(1) of the Act.

Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to establish that the Agreement was duly terminated

upon the failure of the Plaintiff to pay the hire in terms of the Agreement.

The Defendant also took up the position that the Plaintiff had sold the Vehicle to one R.

Dayasena without the consent of the Defendant and that therefore the Defendant had the right

in terms of the Agreement and the Act to repossess the Vehicle. Clause 4(0) of the Agreement

imposes a duty on the Hirer(Plaintiff) not to sell the Vehicle. Where the Hirer(Plaintiff) breaches

this obligation, it is clause 12(2) of the Agreement and Section 18(2) of the Act that applies.

Clause 12(2) of the Agreement reads as follows:

"12(2). If the Hirer:-

(a) does any act with regard to the Vehicle to which this Agreement

relates which is inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement;

(b) breaks any express condition of this Agreement the Owners shall be

entitled to terminate the hire under this Agreement by giving the

Hirer not less than thirty days' notice in writing specifying the

particular breach of act which entitled the Owners to terminate the

hire under the Agreement.

Provided however that in any case where the breach or act specified in the notice is

capable of being remedied by the Hirer it shall be the duty of the Owners to require the

Hirer by such notice to remedy the breach or act complained of before the expiry of the

said period of thirty days and if the Hirer remedies the breach complained of before the

expiry of the said period of thirty days the Owners shall not be entitled to terminate the

hire under the Agreement."

The question that arises is whether clause 12(2) of the Agreement and Section 18(2) of the Act

requires two notices like in clause 12(1) of the Agreement and section 18(1) of the Act. Section

18(1) of the Act uses the words "@25X)q~ 8c.:le3GCB25l' ~ ((125l'tl~ ~8c.:lC) C025l'25)~C) ~@25l' Ota

qDe525l' Be 8gQ)~ 8c.:lGCB25l' ~ ((125l'tl" "(emphasis added)(the English version is "after

giving the hirer notice in writing ..... the owner shall be entitled to terminate the agreement by

giving the hirer notice of termination in writing") ")(emphasis added). Clearly this contemplates

two notices as interpreted by the Supreme Court in L.B. Finance Ltd. v. Weligamage and

6

I(I

Others3 However, the wording in section 18(2) of the Act is different. Unlike section 18(1) It

does not refer to a "notice of termination". The wording is '~Z5) 3C0Z5)() G'Z5)~q~ <3C35GG~zrl' ~

'tlzrl'e5@~ ~<3C3() (l)zrl'Z5)~() ~G'@zrl' (;38a@ qt)e5zrl' ~e@() (!)~() ... "(English version is "owner shall

be entitled to terminate the agreement by giving the hirer not less than thirty days' notice in

writing ... ")(emphasis added). Unlike section 18(1) it does not use the word "oE". The English

version of section 18(2) uses the word "by" whereas section 18(1) uses the word "after". In

these circumstances, I am of the view that section 18(2) requires only one notice.

The learned District Judge appears to conclude that the Plaintiff had in fact sold the Vehicle to

one R. Dayasena without the consent of the Defendant. However, even in that situation the

Defendant should have given the Hirer not less than thirty days' notice in writing specifying the

particular breach or act which entitled the Owners to terminate the hire under the Agreement.

There is no evidence of such a notice and thus the Defendant has failed to establish that clause

12(2) of the Agreement and Section 18(2) of the Act was complied with prior to seizure of the

Vehicle.

In view of these facts, I am of the view that the learned District Judge was correct in concluding

that the Defendant had seized the Vehicle without lawfully terminating the Agreement.

The Defendant has in the written submissions sought to argue that the Plaintiff had repudiated

the Agreement by selling the Vehicle to one R. Dayasena and that therefore the Defendant had

the right to repossess the Vehicle.

Repudiation may occur either expressly, as where a party states in so many words that he will

not discharge the obligations he has undertaken, or impliedly, as where by his own act a party

disables himself from performance or makes it impossible for the other party to render

performance.4Where one party repudiates a contract, the other party has two options. One is

to accept the repudiation and sue for damages immediately or the other is not to accept the

repudiation and consider the contract as still subsisting. Where the innocent party elects to

accept the repudiation and treat the contract as cancelled, such election has been held to be

effective only if communicated to the party in breach.s

These are some of the general principles of the law of contract governing repudiation. When

parties contract party autonomy empowers them to give effect to these general principles

according to their intentions. The legislature has also at times incorporated these general

principles with or without modifications. That is what is to be garnered when one considers

Clause 4(0) of the Agreement, which imposes a duty on the Hirer(Plaintiff) to not sell the

Vehicle with clause 12(2) of the Agreement and section 18(2) of the Act. There can indeed be

repudiation where the Hirer(Plaintiff) sold the Vehicle to a third party. However, an unaccepted

repudiation is a thing writ in water.6 Clause 12(2) of the Agreement and section 18(2) of the Act

sets out how such a repudiation should be accepted if the Owner(Defendant) wishes to do so.

Defendant should have given the Plaintiff not less than thirty days' notice in writing specifying

the particular breach or act which entitled the Owners to terminate the hire under the

Agreement. The Defendant has failed to do so. In these circumstances, it is the Defendant who

has breached the Agreement. In Raymond Fernando v. Bank of Cey/on7 the Supreme Court held

that the hire purchase agreement had not been duly terminated in terms of section 18 of the

Act as the required two weeks' notice was not given.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Bandarawela dated 4th June 1996 and dismiss the appeal with costs.
