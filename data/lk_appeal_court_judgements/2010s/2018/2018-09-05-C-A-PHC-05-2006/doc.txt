This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Sabaragamuwa Province

holden in Kegalle dated 22nd November 2005.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) filed a certificate in the Magistrates Court of

Kegalle in terms of sections 59(1)(c) and 59(4) of the Co-operative Societies Law No.5 of 1972 as

amended (Law) to enforce an arbitral award made against the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant

(Appellant) for a sum of Rs. 13,74,024/72.

The Appellant filed objections to the said application and took up the following objections:

(a) The Law is not in force anymore.

(b) The Respondent did not have power to file the certificate.

After hearing parties, the learned Magistrate of Kegalle overruled the objections ofthe Appellant.

The Appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden

in Kegalle which was dismissed. Hence this appeal.

The grounds urged on behalf of the Appellant must be considered after examining the scope of

the proceedings in the Magistrates Court upon a certificate filed in terms of sections 59(1)(c) and

59(4) of the Law.

In this scrutiny, it is useful and indeed permissible to examine the interpretation given by Courts

to similar provisions found in the repealed Co-operative Societies Ordinance. It is an established

rule of interpretation that the legislature is presumed to know the law, judicial decisions and

general principles of law. Bindra [Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes, 10th ed., page 235] states as

follows:

"The legislature must be presumed to know the course of the legislation, as well as the

course of judicial decisions in the country, a fortiorari of the superior courts of the

country. It is a well-settled rule of construction that when a statute is repealed and re-

enacted, and words in the repealed statute are reproduced in the new statute, they

should be interpreted in the sense which had been judicially put on them in the repealed

Act, because the legislature is presumed to be acquainted with the construction which

courts have put upon the words, when they repeat the same words, they must be taken

to have accepted the interpretation put on them by the court as correctly reflecting the

legislative mind."

In Nilamdeen v. Nanayakkara (76 N.L.R. 169) it was held that it is a well-known rule of

construction that where the legislature uses in an Act a legal term which has received judicial

interpretation, it must be assumed that the term is used in the sense in which it has been

judicially interpreted. There is also another rule of construction that where the words of an old

statute are made part of a new statute, the legal interpretation which has been put upon the

former by courts of law is applicable to those same words in the new statute.

Section 53A (5) of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance read:

"The Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why

further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be taken against him

and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the amount shall be deemed to be a fine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter ... " (emphasis added)

Section 59(4) of the Law reads:

"Where a certificate is issued to a Magistrate under paragraph (c) of subsection (1), the

Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter before him to show cause why

further proceedings for the recovery of the amount should not be taken against him,

and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the amount shall be deemed to be a fine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable

with fine only or not punishable with imprisonment, and the provisions of section 291

(except paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (1) of that section) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act,No.15 of 1979 shall thereupon apply, and the Magistrate may make any

direction which, by the provisions of that section, he could have made at the time of

imposing such sentence ... " (emphasis added)

Section 53A (7) of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance read:

"Nothing in this section shall authorise or require a District Court or Magistrate in any

proceedings thereunder to consider, examine or decide the correctness of any statement

in the certificate of the Registrar."

Section 59(6) of the Law reads:

"Nothing in this section shall authorize or require a District Court or Magistrate in any

proceedings thereunder to consider, examine or decide the correctness of any statement

in the certificate of the Registrar."

The Supreme Court in Mohideen v. Assistant Commissioner of Co-operative Development,

Kalmunai (80 N.L.R. 206) was called upon to interpret Section 53A (5) of the Co-operative

Societies Ordinance and Pathirana J. held that the only grounds that can be urged before the

Magistrate are that-

(i) the Magistrate has no jurisdiction because the last known place of business or

residence does not fall within the local jurisdiction of the Magistrate.

(ii) that he had paid the amount.

(iii) that he is not the defaulter in that he is not the person from whom the amount is due.

I am of the view that this is the correct interpretation to be adopted in interpreting section 59(4)

of the Law to ascertain the scope of the procedure before the Magistrates Court.

Accordingly, I hold that the Appellant cannot take up the position before the Magistrate that the

Respondent did not have the power to file the certificate. An attack on such exercise of power

may be accommodated in appropriate judicial review proceedings where the vires of the act can

be examined.

In any event, the attack on the validity of the Law by the Appellant is misconceived in law. The

Appellant submits that after the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the Sabaragamuwa

Provincial Council enacted a Statute on Co-operative Societies, statute No.3 of 1994, and as such

the Law does not apply to the Sabaragamuwa Province.

Co-operative undertakings and the organization, registration, supervision and audit of co-

operative societies within the Province is a matter coming within the Provincial Council List. In

Alawwa and 4 others v. Katugampola MPCS and another [(1996) 2 SrLL.R. 278] the Supreme

Court held that Article 154(G)8 of the Constitution unequivocally serves to keep alive all the laws

in force on matters relating to the Provincial list, when a Provincial Council is established, subject

Page 4 of 5

to the specified limitations and that the article also makes it clear as to when a law in force

remains suspended and inoperative (not repealed) in that Province and that is when

subsequently the Provincial Council makes a statute on the same matter which is described in its

long title as being inconsistent with the law in force and when that statute receives assent and

so long as it is in force. The appeal brief does not contain a copy of statute No.3 of 1994 passed

by the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council on Co-operative Societies. My own research for this

statute has proved futile. In these circumstances, it is not possible to hold that the law does not

apply within the Sabaragamuwa Province.

In any event, the Appellant is a registered co-operative society under the law (v.l). In terms of

by-law 1.3.1 of the Appellant, its area of jurisdiction is the whole island and not limited to the

Sabaragamuwa Province. Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was

correct in concluding that the Appellant comes within the purview of the law and that the

Respondent did have authority to make the impugned application to the Magistrates Court of

Kegalle in terms of sections 59(1)(c) and 59(4) of the law.

For the forgoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle dated 22nd November 2005.

I dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
