Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant seeking

to recover some money. The defendant sought dismissal of the

action. At the trial, upon issues being raised, the learned

District Judge has decided to try issue Nos. 5-7 raised by the

defendant as preliminary legal issues. Those issues have been

answered in favour of the defendant, and the plaintiffs action

has been dismissed. It is against this order the plaintiff has

preferred this direct appeal.

At the argument before this Court, the learned counsel for the

defendant-respondent moved to dismiss the appeal in limine on

the basis that the direct appeal filed against that order under

section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code is misconceived in

law, and the proper remedy was to come by way of leave to

appeal under section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The question whether an appeal or leave to appeal lies against

an "order" of the District Court had been a subject of much

controversy for a long period of time.

One school of thought represented by the leading local case of

Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd [1984] 1 Sri LR 286 Justice

Sharvananda (later Chief Justice) opted to adopt "order

approach" (suggested by Lord Alverstone C.J., in Bozson v.

Altrincham Urban District Council [1903] 1 KB 547) to determine

that question. The "order approach" contemplates only the

nature of the order in isolation. When taken in isolation, if the

order finally disposes of the matter in dispute without leaving

the suit alive, the order is final, and a direct appeal is the proper

remedy against such order.

3

The other school of thought represented by the leading local

case of Ranjit v. Kusumawathie [1998] 3 Sri LR 232 Justice

Dheeraratne opted to adopt "application approach" (suggested by

Lord Esher M.R., in Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange (1877) 3

CPD 67 and Salaman v. Warner [1891] 1 QB 734, and adopted by

Lord Denning M.R., in Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB

597) to determine that question. The "application approach"

contemplates only the nature of the application made to Court in

isolation, and not the order delivered per se. In accordance with

this approach, if the order, given in one way, will finally dispose

of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other way, will allow

the action to go on, the order is not final, but interlocutory, in

which event, leave to appeal is the proper remedy.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Chettiar v. Chettiar

[2011] 2 Sri LR 70 and [2011] BLR 25 was called upon to decide

on this vexed question, and the Full Bench of the Supreme

Court (consisting of five Justices) having discussed both the

approaches stemming from English decisions unanimously

decided that the application approach (and not the order

approach) shall be the criterion in deciding the question whether

appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy against an "order"

of the District Court.

This Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court has consistently

been followed in later Supreme Court cases.

In Yogendra v. Tharmaratnam (SC Appeal No.87/09, SC (HCCA)

LA No.84/09) decided on 06.07.2011, Justice Marsoof with the

concurrence of Justice Ratnayake and Justice Imam inter alia

stated that: The decision of five judges of this Court in the

4

Rajendran Chettiar case is not only binding on this Bench as it is

presently constituted, but also reflects the practice of Court both in

England as well as in Sri Lanka.

In Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC Appeal No.03/09, SC (HC) LA

No.147/08) decided on 16.03.2012 and reported in [2012] BLR

109 Justice Ratnayake with Justice Suresh Chandra and

Justice Dep (later Chief Justice) agreeing followed the said

Rajendran Chettiar case.

Justice Tilakawardane with the agreement of Justice Marsoof

and Justice Imam in Prof. I.K. Perera v. Prof. Dayananda

Somasundara (SC Appeal No. 152/2010) decided on 17.03.2011

also had no hesitation to refer with approval the said Full Bench

decision of the Supreme Court.

Notwithstanding this was a Full Bench decision of the Supreme

Court, still, there were some lingering doubts regarding the

correctness of this decision. Therefore, in Senanayake v.

Jayantha (SC Appeal No. 41/2015) decided on 04.08.2017, a

Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of seven Judges)

revisited the Chettiars Judgment.

One of the main concerns for such a necessity, in my view, was

the prejudice caused to some of the appellants whose lawyers

filed final appeals against the orders of the District Court on the

basis of the Judgment of Justice Sharvananda in Siriwardena v.

Air Ceylon Ltd (supra). Therefore, there was a growing tendency

to argue that the Chettiars Judgment has no retrospective

effect.

5

Although this matter (i.e. whether the Chettiars Judgment has a

retrospective effect), as seen from the Judgment, was in the

forefront, the Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court in Senanayake

v. Jayantha (supra) has not specifically addressed that issue.

The Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal only on two

questions of law, which does not include the above question.

The Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of seven

Judges) has decided that the Judgment of the Full Bench of the

Supreme Court (consisting of five Judges) in Chettiars case is

correct, and the test which shall be applied to decide whether

appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy against an order

of the District Court is the application approach and not the

order approach.

Chief Justice Dep (with the concurrence of the other six Justices

of the Supreme Court) held that:

In order to decide whether an order is a final judgment or not, it

is my considered view that the proper approach is the approach

adopted by Lord Esher in Salamam v. Warner [1891] 1 QB 734,

which was cited with approval by Lord Denning in Salter Rex &

Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597. It stated: If their decision,

whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally dispose of the

matter in dispute, I think that for that purpose of these Rules it is

final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will

finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other,

will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

6

The Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court did not think it fit

to consider whether the Five Judge Bench Judgment of the

Supreme Court in Chettiars case has retrospective effect or not,

and instead dismissed the appeal on the basis that the plaintiff

should have filed a leave to appeal application and not a final

appeal against the dismissal of the plaintiffs action on a

preliminary issue (even though that order of dismissal was made

by the District Court prior to the Judgment in Chettiers case).

That means, whether the order appealed from was given prior to

the Judgment in Chettiers case or not, the correct test is the

Application Test and not the Order Test. Accordingly, if the

order, given in one way, will finally dispose of the matter in

dispute, but, if given in the other way, will allow the action to go

on, the order is not final, but interlocutory, in which event, leave

to appeal is the proper remedy.

When I adopt that test to the present appeal, it is abundantly

clear that, an appeal does not lie against the order of dismissal

made by the District Judge. Notwithstanding the impugned

order takes the shape of a final Judgment as it is, if the said

preliminary issues were to be decided against the defendant, the

case would not have ended there, but the trial would have

proceeded with, and ultimately the case would have been

decided on merits.

I uphold the preliminary objection and dismiss the appeal but

without costs.
