Priyantha Deniyaya for the l(a) Defendant-Appellant.

Manohara de Silva, PC with Hirosha Munasinghe for the Plaintiff-Respondent.

12.09.2017

The original Defendant-Appellants appealed against the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Nuwaraeliya dated 28.03.2000 in which he allowed the reliefs

prayed for in the plaint dated 15.05.1990. By way of the plaint the Plaintiff-

Respondent had prayed for a declaration of title to the land morefully described

iIi the schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the Defendants, their agents and all

those claiming under them from the said land and the Plaintiff-Respondent had

also pr~yed for possession to,. be given to her amon~ other reliefs prayeq for in the

plaint. Both Defendants filed their answer praying for a dismissal of the

plaintiff's action among other reliefs that they had sought iri the said answer.

The cause of action that had been pleaded by the Plaintiff is based on a deed of

transfer marked P2 that had been executed on 17.01.1990 in favour of the

Plaintiff. By way of this deed bearing No. 1426, one Don Gabriel Gunasekara

J ayasundera, (the father of the parties to the case) and the original grantee of the

land depicted in the schedule to this deed, had transferred the land to his

daughter-the Plaintiff Chandrani Jayasundara for a consideration of Rupees One

/'

Hundred Thousand (Rs 100,000). Prior to the execution of this deed on

17.01,.1990, the transferor, Don Gabriel Gunesekara Jayasundera, the father of

the parties to the case, had obtained permission from the relevant competent

authority in terms of the Mahaweli Authority Act. This permission has been

marked as P2(a). The permission had been granted on 13.01.1990. It is by virtue

of these two documents (P2 and P2 (a) that the Plaintiff came to Court seeking a

declaration of title in her favour.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellants impugned the document

marked P2(a) on the ground that this document was not valid because there had

not been a prior request for the transfer of this land.

) Learned President's Counsel who appears for the Plaintiff-Respondent relies on

the presumption contained in Section 114( d) of the Evidence Ordinance which

enacts that ''judicial and official acts have been regularly performed" It is

apposite to look at the presumption of regularity of judicial and official acts as

contained in Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance.

PRESUMPTION WHICH THE COURT MA Y DRAW

Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance enacts:

"The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to

have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events,

human conduct, and public and private business in ~heir relation to the

facts of the particular case. "

Illustration (d) - Judicial and official acts

The Court may presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly

performed.

The rule embodied in this illustration flows from the maxim omnia proesumuntur

rite et solemniter esse acta, i.e., all acts are presumed to have been rightly and

2

regularly done. The rebuttable character and nature of the presumption in Section

114( d) of the Evidence Ordinance have been emphasized.

"Although there is a presumption that official acts have been regularly

performed, and that they have been performed in accordance with rules

and regulations bearing on the subject, yet this is a rebuttable

presumption. In fact, it is left to the Court to raise that presumption or not,

having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case". 1

"A presumption that an act was regularly done arises only on proof that

the act was in fact done, as the presumption is limited to the regularity of

the act done and does not extend to the doing of the Act itself'. 2

"In other words, the presumption that may be raised is that the act if

proved to have been done was done in a regular manner. There is no

presumption that an act was done, of which there is no evidence and the

pro%/which is essential to the case raised".3

In Dharmatilake vs. Brampy Singho 40 N.L.R. 497 at page 501, Keuneman J

citing the Section 114( d) of the Evidence Ordinance stated that the maxim means

that if an official act is proved to have been done, it will be presumed to have

been regularly done. It does not raise any presumption that an act was done of

which there is no evidence and the proof of which is essential to a case .

.. The adduction in evidence of the document P2(a) establishes the fact that the

official act of granting permission to transfer the state land was performed. Was it

regularly performed after a request was made? On the strength of the above

principles it is crystal clear that the item of evidence P2(a) is sufficient to raise

the presumption of the regularity of the grant of permission. The onus would then

lWoodroffe and Ameer An Law of Evidence, 13th ed. Vol. 3, page 2602 2Monir, Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence, 4th ed. Vol. 2, page 676. 3Monir Principles and Digest of the Law of Evidence, 4th ed. Vol. 2, page 676, at footnote 24.

devolve on the Defendants to rebut this presumption. It would appear that

evidence in rebuttal of the presumption was not led by the Defendants.

Evidentiary Proof

Moreover, in addition to the presumption that P2(a) raised as to the regularity of

consent, this Court fmds that there is also evidence led to prove in the District

Court as to the grant of consent of the transfer consequent to a prior request and

the evidence is to the effect that a prior request to permit the transfer had in fact

been made.

The grantor of the permission himself has given evidence testifying to the request

made - vide page 89 of the brief. Thus this Court takes the view that evidence of

a prior request has been established and such evidentiary proof and the rebuttable

presumption of regularity of the official act have not been rebutted and therefore

this Court holds that the permission to transfer the state land has been properly

and regularly given.

Thus the transfer deed, bearing No. 1426 and dated 17.01.1990 (P2) cannot be

impugned. In any event when the Plaintiff closed his case on 03.11.1999, the

deed of transfer marked P2 was not objected to by the Defendants at the

conclusion of the case. This Court bears in mind the salutary principle

adumbrated in cases such as Sri Lanka Ports Authority And Another vs.

Jugolinija Boat Authority (1981) 1 Sri.LR 18 and Balapitiya *'Gunanandana

< Thero vs. Talalle Mettananda Thero 1997 2 Sri.LR 101, both of which

emphasise the principle that if a document is admitted subject to proof but is not

objected to when tendered in evidence at the close of the case, it becomes

evidence in the case. We would adopt this principle in toto as far as the

documents namely P2(a) (grant of permission) and P2 (the deed of transfer by

the father of the parties to the case in favour of the plaintiff) are concerned.

4

The cursus curiae established by the precedents of Sri Lanka Ports Authority

and Balapitiya Gunanandana Thero has to be taken into account when this

Court takes note of the fact that absolute title to the property devolved on the

Plaintiff as far back 17.01.1999 when her father conveyed the subject-matter of

the action to the Plaintiffby P2.

Even the Notary had been summoned to prove the due execution of the deed and

the Notary Tilaka Herath' s evidence has not been dented or impugned in any

manner whatsoever.

In the circumstance this Court sees no reason to disturb the fmding of the learned

District Judge of Nuwaraeliya as to the declaration of title granted in favour of

the Plaintiff-Respondent.

The other matter that was urged before this Court on behalf of the Defendant-

Appellants is the long possession that the Defendant-Appellants allegedly had.

This Court fmds items of the evidence emanating from the 1 st Defendant that he

had only permissive possession, as the title to the property was in his father Don

Gabriel Gunesekara J ayasundera who was also the father of the Plaintiff and we

observe that his possession was also accompanied by payment of income made to

the father-see evidence to this effect at page 112 of the appeal brief. It goes

without saying that the 1 st Defendant has admitted the title of the father. In the

circumstances it would not lie in his mouth to plead prescription against the

father having regard to the fact that he had been let on the land with the leave and . licence of the father-see Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance.

This Court has held in R.R. Somawathie vs. Don Harold Stassen Jayawardena

CA 36/2000 (F) (CA minutes of 30.11.2016) that if entry into possession is on a

dependant title, the acknowledged principle in law is that possession is presumed

to continue in that capacity. There must be a manifest change in causa to possess'

on an independent and adverse title.

5

Considering the totality of the evidence led in the case and upon a perusal of the . . . judgment dated 23.08.2000, this Court sees no reason to disturb the conclusion

reached by the learned District Judge of Nuwaraeliya and affIrms the judgment.

Thus we proceed to dismiss the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed.
