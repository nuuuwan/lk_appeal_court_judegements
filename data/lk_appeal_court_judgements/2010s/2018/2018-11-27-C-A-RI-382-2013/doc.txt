1st & 3rd to 6th Defendant-

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Parakrama Agalawatta for the 2nd Defendant-

Petitioner.

H. Withanachchi for the 5th and 6th Defendant-

Respondents.

Argued &

Decided on: 26.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The 2nd defendant-petitioner has filed this application dated

07.11.2013 for restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside the

Judgment dated 14.10.2002 and the order dated 16.09.2011

delivered by the learned District Judge of Pugoda in Partition

Case No.339/P.

3

By the said Judgment the learned District Judge has left of

the corpus, which was entitled to Engalthina Perera (after the

execution of the Deed marked P1) unallotted. This has been

accepted by the 2nd defendant, and no appeal has been preferred

against the Judgment.

Several years after the said Judgment, the two children of

Engalthina Perera has made an application to the District Court

claiming the Engalthinas share left unallotted. They have

been added as the 5th and 6th defendants. After a formal

inquiry, the learned District Judge has allowed that application

by order dated 16.09.2011. No appeal with leave obtained has

been filed against that order.

The 2nd defendant-petitioner has filed this application, more

than 11 years after the Judgment and more than 2 years after

the said order, challenging the finding of the learned District

Judge leaving share of the land unallotted as Engalthinas

balance share.

The 2nd defendant now produces the Deed No. 21703 dated

15.11.1942 to convince that Engalthina conveyed all her rights

by Deed P1 to Alis Nona, and after the execution of the Deed P1,

there was nothing left for Engalthina.

The Deed No. 21703 was not produced at the trial. At the trial

the position taken up by the 2nd defendant was that Engalthina

owned share of the corpus. But according to Deed No. 21703,

Engalthina owned only share of the corpus. The 2nd defendant

did not produce Deed No. 21703 in order to claim a larger share

of the corpus. Having successfully done so, he now produces the

4

Deed No. 21703 in order to defeat the claim of the 5th and 6th

defendants.

The 2nd defendant cannot approbate and reprobate to have the

best of both worlds.

Restitutio in integrum is a discretionary remedy. A party who

seeks a discretionary remedy shall come to Court with clean

hands. He must also act with promptitude. The facts and

circumstances of this case clearly militate against using that

discretion in favour of the 2nd defendant.

As Chief Justice Sansoni stated in Cassim v. Government Agent,

Batticaloa1 There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect

orders have to go unreversed.

Application of the 2nd defendant is dismissed. No costs.
