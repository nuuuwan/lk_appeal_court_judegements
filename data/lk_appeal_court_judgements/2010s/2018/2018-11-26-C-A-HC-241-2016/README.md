: 07th November, 2018

: 16th November, 2018

The appellant along with three others were indicted in the High

Court of Chilaw under section 296 of the Penal Code for murder. Before

the trial commenced second and third accused have died, and the trial

was against the first and fourth accused. After trial fourth accused was

acquitted and the first accused was convicted for murder and was

sentenced to death.

The story of the prosecution was that the deceased and the

appellant were from the same neighborhood. On the day prior to the

incident Jude Nishantha the sole eye witness to this incident his younger

brother and pregnant mother have been watching TV around 8.30 p.m.

~. when the appellant and the other ac~used have stormed into their house

looking for 'the deceased. As the deceased was not there the appellant

had attacked his pregnant wife on the back with a club. Jude Nishantha

had run out of the house and the second accused had chased him. He

had returned home after making a complaint to the police to find that the

neighbors have taken his mother to the Marawila hospital.

On the day of the incident Jude Nishantha along with his father had

gone to see the mother in hospital and after they returned home, the

deceased had asked Jude to pring food for them. When Jude Nishantha

was about to leave the house, the four accused have stormed into their

house armed with a swords a Katty and clubs. The appellant had attacked

Nishantha with a Katty and on hearing the noise the deceased had come

out of the house. The appellant had attacked the deceased with the Katty

on the back after that they have chased Jude Nishantha and he had run

to the police station. As he ra,n away he has not seen what happened

after the initial attack on the deceased. When he returned he has found

his father fallen on the ground a few houses away. The reason for the

attack had been, their dog biting the daughter of the third accused who is

also the sister of the other three. The said dog was later found in the

premises killed by cutting into three pieces which is the subsequent

conduct of the accused which shows the common murderous intention

they had.

Witness Mary Janet a neighbor of the deceased has stated in

evidence that she heard male voice shouting "oo:Jeb t:i)~ei)eb" and when

she peeped through the fence she had seen the four accused running

towards the deceased's house, armed with clubs and kattys. Later she

has heard the cries of the deceased's son. Sometime later the deceased

had come towards her house breaking the fence and fallen inside. Later

the police jeep had come and taken him to hospital. She has later heard

that the dog belonging to the deceased had been cut into three pieces.

This witness had identified the katty marked P1 as the katty the appellant

was carrying that day.

The police witnesses have observed the trail of blood from the

deceased's house to the house where he was found fallen. The

postmortem report corroborated the evidence of Mary Janet who said the

deceased had injuries on his back.

The appellant made a dock statement stating that the day prior to

the incident the deceased came to his house and cut him with a sword

and when he gained consciousness he was in hospital. The learned

counsel argued that the injuries on the appellant was not considered by

the learned High Court Judge and that he failed to consider his dock

statement.

~ I -j

This point of argument of the counsel fails as they failed to put to

the witness at the High Court that the appellant was injured on the

previous day. It was for the first time that he mentioned this in his dock

statement. The Learned High Court Judge quite correctly rejected the

dock statement.

The next point of argument of the appellant's counsel was that the

learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the evidence properly. On

perusal of the learned High Court Judge's judgment we find that he has

carefully analysed the prosecution evidence. Mary Janet is an

independent witness and her evidence on the injuries of the deceased

corroborates the medical evidence.

All grounds of appeal stated by the counsel have failed. The

learned High Court Judge has analysed the evidence and correctly

rejected the appeliant's dock'statement. Which was on evidence not

suggested to the witnesses at the trial.

This is not a case on circumstantial evidence as stated by the

counsel for the appellant. There is an eye witness who's evidence was

corroborated by Mary Janet's evidence. This appeal has no merit.

5 ,

For the afore stated reason~ we decided to affirm the judgment

and conviction dated 24/10/2016 of the High Court of Chilaw. Appeal is

dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed.
