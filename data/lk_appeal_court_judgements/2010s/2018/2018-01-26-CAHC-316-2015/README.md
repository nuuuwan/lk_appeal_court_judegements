H.I. Pieris, DSG for AG

08.12.2017

On the last day we have made all attempts to reach the Accused-

Appellant and his Counsel, but all our attempts brought no

resul ts to us. Therefore on the last occasion, we decided to

fix this matter for argument.

State is represented by Mr. Hiranjan Pieris, DSG who assist the

Court to reach a just decision.

The learned DSG made submissions to assist the Court in this

matter. We perused the petition of Appeal filed by the Accused-

Appellant. In a summary, grounds of Appeal can be formulated in

a following manner.

(1) There is no reasonable trial offered to the Accused-

Appellant.

(2) The charge is vague.

(3) Learned trial Judge couldn't have reached the decision with

the available evidence before him.

The Accused-Appellant originally indicted before the High Court

of Colombo as follows:

On the 01/05/2001, he has committed an offence of rape of a

child known as Mana Marakkalage Jacintha Cooray punishable under

Section 364(2) (e) of the Penal Code. The witness commenced her

evidence, than the State moved the Court to amend the charge to

under Section 365 (b) (2) (b) for committing an offence of grave

sexual abuse to a person who is less than 16 years of age.

The said charge was read over to the Accused/Appellant and he

pleaded not guilty.

Considering the available material, we find that the prosecution

has led the evidence of the prosecutrix,

and other witness.

The evidence before the Court was clearly identifies the Accused

with certainity. Regarding the incident, the child says that on

the day of the incident, she was playing with her friend called

Wasanthi, the Accused-Appellant is Wasanthi's uncle. When these

two were playing at Wasanthi's place, the Accused- Appellant had

sent Wasanthi to buy cigarettes to nearby shop.

The girl was 12 years and few months at the time of the incident

was forced by the Accused-Appellant which resulted in making the

child unconscious. She made a prompt complaint and revealed the

entire incident to the Police. The mother also corroborates the

daughter in her evidence.

The learned DSG submits that he is supporting the conviction and

the sentence.

Considering all available materials, we find that the learned

trial judge has considered all the evidence available before her

and given reasons for her findings in length and found the

Accused-Appellant guilty.

We analyzed the evidence and the reason given by the judge and

we have no reasons to interfere with her decision.

Therefore, we affirm the decision. Accordingly we affirm the

conviction and the sentence.

Regarding the sentence, we make special note that the Accused-

Appellant was given a reasonable and we have no intention to

interfere with the same.

Considering all circumstances, we affirm the conviction and the

sentence and dismiss the appeal.

It was brought to our notice that the Accused-Appellant is on

bail. Therefore, we direct the Registrar to forward the case

record to the Registrar of High Court Colombo to implement the

sentence forthwith.
