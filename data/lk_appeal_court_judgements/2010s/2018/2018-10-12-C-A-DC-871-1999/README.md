*****

M. M. A. GAFOOR. J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'Respondent')

instituted the instant action in the District Court of Monaragela seeking a

declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint,

ejectment of the Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

'Appellant') and all persons claiming under the Appellant from the said land

and damages in a sum Rs. 10,000 per annum till the Plaintiff-Respondent

is restored to possession thereof.

The Position taken up by the Respondent was that he is the lawful owner

of the land in question; Wanasinghe Mudiyanselage Balawardena

('Balawardena') who transferred the said land to him by deed No. 648

dated 01.06.1993. Documents marked by the Respondent show that

Balawardena owned that property under a Swarnabhoomi Deed.

The Respondent further stated that since June 1993, he began cultivation

in the property which is approximately 2 Acres. And the Appellant entered

in to the said land by force and has been in occupation thereof without any

rights.

The position taken by the Appellant was little different, she has submitted a

chain of facts and issues that:

She along with her children was living with the aforesaid predecessor, Balawardena as husband and wife (during the cross-examination Balawardena admitted that she was his mistress - page at 43) for a period of 23 years and has possessed the said land.

Balawardena was admitted that he paid maintenance for his children, and also that there was a maintenance case bearing No. 19293 in Bibile Magistrate's Court.

Therefore, Balawardena (already admitted that) gave an assurance to the Divisional Secretary that his children will not be destitute in consequence of the transfer of that Swamabhoomi - land.

Balawardena did not inform the Divisional Secretary that he was having depending children, thereby Appellant take a position that Balawardena obtained the aforesaid permission by fraudulently. And the Divisional Secretary also failed to inquire from him whether he has any dependents.

Therefore, the Appellant further stated that Balawardena transferred the

property to the Respondent in breach of the rules and regulations

pertaining to transfer of properties coming under the Swamabhoomi

scheme and thereby the Divisional Secretary and Grama Sevaka were

acting illegally in respect to the said Deed of Transfer. She further

submitted that she was in possession of the property for about 20 years.

At the trial both parties admitted that one Balawardena was the original

owner of the land in suit and the said land is described in the schedule to

the plaint. Parties raised 16 issues between them and at the conclusion of

the trail, the learned District Judge by his judgment dated 07.07.1999 held

in favour of the Respondent. It is from the said judgment; the Appellant has

preferred this appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, the main argument revolved around deed No.

648 dated 01.06.1993 marked as ~l 2 as to whether it was a valid deed or

not. Appellant stated that as mentioned above the Divisional Secretary of

Medagama without holding any inquiry had acted arbitrarily and illegally in

granting permission to transfer the said land to the Respondent. But, to

answer this issue (issue No. 12 and 13) the learned District Judge hold

that the letter dated 01.12.1992 (marked as P-2a) issued by the

Medagama Additional Government Agent has proved the fact that the

transfer of the property by Deed No. 648 of 01.06.1993 is valid (vide page

71 in the appeal brief). After considering the facts and the relevant

document P-2a, the learned District Judge has delivered his judgement in

favour of the Respondent.

The instant case instituted for praying a declaration of title for a property

(action rei vindicatio). Therefore, the following issues are noteworthy:

Answer - Yes

According to these issues and answers, it's crystal clear that the learned

District judge was evaluated the entire facts on the basis that whether the

Respondent has a right to bring a rei vindicatio action against Defendant.

If a party bring a vindicatory action two main requisites need to consider.

The action consists of proof:

a) that the party (plaintiff) is an owner of the property;

b) that the property is in the possession of the defendant

The burden of establishing title devolves on the plaintiff. The significance

of this requirement is that, where the plaintiff fails to prove title himself,

judgment in the vindicatory action will be given in favour of the defendant,

even though the latter has also not been able to establish title.

In a long line of cases our courts have consistently held the above

requisites.

In De Silva vs. Gunatillake 32 N.L.R. 217 Macdonell, C. J. citing

authorities on Roman Dutch Law referred to principles applicable to rei

vindicatio action in the following manner:-

I f 1

6

IIThere is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration

of title must have title himself. The authorities unite in holding

that the plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute and

that, if he cannot, the action will not lie."

In Wanigarathne vs. Juwanis Appuhamy65 N.L.R. 167 Herath, J. stated

that,

liThe defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove

anything, still less his own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a

declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the

defendant's title is poor or not established. The plaintiff must

prove and establish his title"

In the case of Dharmadasa vs. Jayasena 1997 3 S.L.R. 327 (SC) G.P.S.

de Silva, C. J. at page 330 quoted with approval the aforementioned

statement of Macdonall CJ in De Silva vs. Gunathileke and the statement

of Herath J in Wanigarathne vs. Juwanis Appuhamy. Thus it is settled law

that in a rei vidicatio action the plaintiff must prove his title. In establishing

his title the plaintiff cannot rely on the weakness of the defendant's title. In

this appeal I have to consider whether the plaintiff established his title or

not.

In Kathiramathamby vs. Arumugam 38 C.L.W. 27 Basnayake, J.

expressly held that, in an action for declaration of title and for restoration to

possession of land from which the plaintiff alleges he has been forcibly

ousted; the burden of proving ouster is on the plaintiff. It was declared,

moreover, that where the plaintiff fails to prove ouster, the defendant's

possession must be assumed to be lawful, and that the defendant is

entitled to rely in this event on the presumption created by section 110 of

the Evidence Ordinance.

In this instant case, I am of the view that the Respondent has proved his

own plea in the District Court; he proved his own title with a valid deed No.

648 dated 01.06.1993.

Even though, the Appellant specifically averred and subtly took a position

that she and her children were living with the aforesaid predecessor,

Balawardena as husband and wife for a period of 23 years and possessing

the said land which clearly established their possession even before the

formal State Grant dated 18.06.1987.

The Counsel for Respondent brought an important fact to this court's

perusal that in the trial, the Appellant admitted that in 1993 she was not

living in the property but at Mellagama and that Balawardena left her on

18.12.1992 whilst they were at Mellagama. Hence it's clear that she came

into the property after the Respondent purchased it, thus the plaintiff-

Respondent argue that she is a trespasser and has no right in law to make

any claim.

Likewise, the learned judge also has highlighted a clear contradiction that

the Appellant claimed in her evidence in-chief that she and the children

were in the said land at the time of the transfer to the Respondent but in

the cross-examination she admitted that until 1995 she was at Mellegama

and in the re-examination she said that until Balawardena left her in 1993

she was at Mellagama. But the said land in question is at Thimbiriya. The

learned judge was mindful of these contradictions. (Vide page 74 in the

appeal brief

Further, the Appellant claimed that she had done few improvements on the

land; thereby she argued that she has a right to claim compensation. But

the learned District Judge in his judgement came to a conclusion that she

has failed to prove clearly and precisely the value of the improvements.

This court also has the same opinion. Further, the appellant has no right to

claim compensation and the original owner of the land was Balawardena;

not the Appellant. Therefore, I hold that the -Appellant is not entitled to any

compensation.

For the aforementioned reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned District Judge.

Therefore, I affirm the judgment dated 07.07.1999. And dismiss this

appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
