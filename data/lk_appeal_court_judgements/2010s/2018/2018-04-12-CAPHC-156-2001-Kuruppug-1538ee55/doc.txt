Learned Senior State Counsel rruses a preliminary

objection to the maintainability of this appeal. The accused-

appellant has preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court

of Ratnapura against the judgment (conviction) pronounced by

the Magistrate's Court. Learned Provincial High Court Judge

3

has dismissed this appeal on 21.03.2001. Thereafter the

accused-appellant had preferred an appeal to this Court

(Court of Appeal) against the judgment of Provincial High

Court which is a judgment pronounced in the exercise of the

appellate jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

It is the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel

that the Court of Appeal does not have appellate jurisdiction in

respect of judgments pronounced by the Provincial High Court

exercising its appellate jurisdiction. Learned Counsel for the

appellant concedes this position.

Upon consideration of the above submissions and the

existing law, this Court is satisfied that this is an appeal

which cannot be entertained by this Court.

The appeal must therefore stand dismissed.

4

Learned Counsel for the appellant however makes an

application urging this Court to treat this appeal as an

application for revision.

This Court observes

(i) that the Magistrate's Court has convicted the

accused-appellant on 1998.11.30, (Sentence was

passed on 1998.12.14).

(ii) that it was the same Counsel who had appeared for

the accused-appellant In this Court for a

considerably long period. (According to minutes in

the docket.)

(iii) that the said learned Counsel has failed to bring

this position to the notice of this Court at the first

opportunity or at any of the subsequent stages until

2014.10.28.

(iv) that he had chosen to make this application only

when this Court was making the order of dismissal

of the instant appeal.

(v) that in any case this Court had ruled on 2014.10.28

that this Court is not in a position to consider

favourably the instant application by the Counsel

for the appellant.

This Court is of the opinion that there is an undue

delay in making this application. Further there IS no

exceptional circumstances also for this Court to act In

revision. In any case this Court had previously declined to

entertain this application. For these reasons we decide to

refuse the application made by the learned Counsel for the

appellant.

Registrar of this Court is directed to send the

original case record back to the relevant Magistrate's Court.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT FO APPEAL

A.L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J.
