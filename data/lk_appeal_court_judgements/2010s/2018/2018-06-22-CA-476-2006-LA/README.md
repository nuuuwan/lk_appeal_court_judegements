Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. After the death of the 1st defendant the

2nd defendant was substituted in his place. Both the defendants

filed statements of claim but failed to appear at the trial. After the

Interlocutory Decree was entered, the defendant made an

application under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of

1997, as amended, for special leave to contest the case stating that

she was mentally unsound at the time the trial took place. This

application was resisted by the plaintiff, and the District Judge

after holding an inquiry, rejected the application of the defendant

by order dated 16.11.2006. It is against this order the defendant

has filed this appeal with leave obtained.

The District Judge citing Andiappa Chettier v. Sanmugam Chettier1

and Malwatta v. Gunasekera2 rejected the defendants application

on the basis that when the Attorney-at-Law on record is not

appearing for his client he shall inform it to Court in unambiguous

terms and mere statement that he has "no instructions" is not

sufficient, and in this case, the Attorney-at-Law on record has

merely stated that she has no instructions, and therefore the trial

cannot be held to have been taken ex parte and hence the

defendant is disentitled to invoke the provisions of section

48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law.

There is no dispute over the principle of law enunciated in those

two cases. However the District Judge in my view erred on facts to

cite those two cases to reject the defendant's application.

In Andiappa Chettier's case (supra) the defendant's Attorney-at-

Law stated that he had "no instructions" and "no material on which

to proceed with the case" but did not state that he was not

appearing for the defendant. The Judgment was entered for the

plaintiff. Later an application was made to reopen the case, which

was disallowed by Court stating that the Judgment was entered

inter partes and not ex parte. The Full Bench of the Supreme

Court affirmed that order and held: "The presence in Court, when a

case is called, of the proctor on the record constitutes an appearance

for the party from whom the proctor holds the proxy, unless the

proctor expressly informs the Court that he does not, on that

occasion, appear for the party."

This case was cited with approval in Malwatta's case (supra) where

the application for a postponement of the trial by the Attorney-at-

Law of the 4th defendant was refused and the Interlocutory Decree

was entered. Thereafter the 4th defendant moved to reopen the

trial under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law, and the District

Judge rejected it on the basis that the trial was not ex parte but

inter partes as there was an appearance for the defendant. This

order was upheld by this Court.

However the facts of the instant case are totally different from

those of the above two cases. Unlike in those two cases, in the

instant case, as seen from the Journal Entry No. 66 dated

01.06.2004 and the proceedings relevant to that date, the

defendant's registered Attorney on record has unambiguously

stated to the District Judge that she does not appear for the

defendant as she has no instructions. Counsel for the plaintiffs

concedes that position.

Notwithstanding the District Judge has cited the law correctly, she

has misapplied the law into the facts of this case. Therefore I take

the view that the defendant is a defaulting party to whom section

48(4)(a)(iv) is applicable.

This is the only ground upon which the application of the

defendant was dismissed after a full inquiry where a number of

witnesses have given evidence and a number of documents have

been marked. I must mention at this stage that, if the District

Judge wanted to dispose of the matter on that ground, which is

purely technical and needs no evidence to be led, it could have

been tried as a preliminary question of law before embarking upon

a lengthy inquiry.

Be that as it may, at the argument before this Court Counsel for

the defendant candidly admitted that the defaulting party at such

inquiry shall, in terms of section 48(c) of the Partition Law, satisfy

the Court (a) that he failed to appear at the trial owing to accident,

misfortune or other unavoidable cause, and (b) that he had a prima

facie right, title or interest to or in the land, and (c) that such right,

title or interest has been extinguished or he has been otherwise

prejudicially affected by the Interlocutory Decree.

It was the submission of counsel for the defendant that the

defendant at the inquiry satisfied all three requirements. I regret I

am unable to agree.

In my view, the defendant has manifestly failed to satisfy the (b)

above. What is her claim? Her claim is to exclude Lot 3B of the

Preliminary Plan from the corpus as it is exclusively used by her as

a roadway to have access to her house, which is situated outside

the corpus. This strip of land is approximately 11 feet wide. On

what ground does the defendant claim title to the said Lot? On

two Deeds and on prescription. One is the Deed marked X5

whereby 8 foot wide and 90 foot long strip of land was purchased

by her father and later gifted to her by Deed marked X6. The

plaintiff does not dispute it and the District Judge both in the

Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree has given that portion to

the defendant.

The question is regarding the balance 3 foot wide portion of Lot 3B.

It is the evidence of the defendant at the inquiry that the 8 foot

wide road later widened up to 11 feet because the owner of the

land to the south of the corpus, Sarath Abeywickrema, donated

that part to the road. (Page 10 of the proceedings dated

25.04.2006)

The defendant also called Sarath Abeywickrema to give evidence on

her behalf. His evidence was that he has been in occupation of his

land since around 1993 and when he wanted to put up a boundary

wall on the northern side of his land, the defendant requested to

give a portion of his land to widen her roadway and he agreed to it

and prepared the Sale Agreement marked X14 in 1998 but could

not complete the sale as she was found missing. (pages 2-3 of the

proceedings dated 15.06.2006) X14 was notarially executed after

6

the lis pendens in this case was registered and therefore void in

terms of section 66 of the Partition Law.

Even if it was executed before filing the partition action, still, it was

only an Agreement to Sell and no title passed to the defendant. In

other words, the owner of the balance 3 foot wide portion of Lot 3B

was, Sarath Abeywickrema and not the defendant. However,

Sarath Abeywickrema never wanted to be a party to the partition

action and he claims no right or interest from the corpus.

It is relevant to note that at the inquiry the defendant never spoke

about prescription. Even if she did, according to her own evidence

and that of Sarath Abeywickrema which I adverted to earlier, it is

not possible at all for her to maintain a claim on prescription for

the balance 3 foot wide portion of Lot 3B.

It is my considered view that no prima facie claim regarding the

balance portion of Lot 3B has been made out by the defendant and

therefore the defendant is not entitled to succeed on her

application under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law.

Notwithstanding the finding of the District Judge is incorrect, her

conclusion is correct.

Appeal is dismissed but without costs.
