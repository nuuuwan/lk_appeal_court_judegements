**********

ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Embilipitiya for committing the murder of his son-in-law, Kodituwakku

Hettiarachcige Samantha, on 30th April 2007. After a trial without a jury, he

was convicted for murder and was sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Accused-

Appellant seeks to challenge its validity before this Court on the basis of

following grounds of appeal:-

a. the trial Court failed to consider the evidence of PW3

Jayasena to whom the deceased had made his first II dying

declaration" which tends to support the position taken up

by the Accused-Appellant at the trial, and the conflicting

nature of the three such declarations,

2

b. the trial Court had erred on the overall burden of the

prosecution by arriving at the conclusion that it had

proved its case before even venturing to analyse the case

for the Accused-Appellant,

c. the trial Court had also erred on the burden of proof of the

Accused -Appellant.

In view of these grounds of appeal, it is necessary to consider the

case presented by the prosecution before the trial Court albeit briefly.

The prosecution relied primarily on two utterances by the deceased,

as to his cause of death or as to any circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, which was made admissible and relevant under

Section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Witness Karolis gave evidence to the effect that whilst attending a

meeting, he was told that his son, the deceased, had been found lying on a

canal bund. The witness immediately sent for a three-wheeler and rushed

to the place, where the deceased was said to be lying. Upon reaching the

place he saw the deceased was seated on the ground and few others who

have gathered around him. When the witness asked who assaulted the

deceased, he merely replied that it was the Accused-Appellant. The

witness could not elicit details of the assault since the Police had already

arrived there to take the deceased away.

The other instance of the deceased making a statement was revealed

upon the evidence of the investigating officer, Sub Inspector Newton.

According to this witness, he received a telephone call at about 5.00 p.m.

3

on 30.04.2007 that a person, under the influence of liquor is behaving in a

disorderly manner at a location closer to Bedigantota temple. Having

arrived at the place as per his information, the witness noted that the

deceased was lying on the ground and was drunk. The dec:eased was

thereafter brought to Suriyawewa Police Station. Upon questioning, the

deceased told the witness that while he was having an argument with his

wife, the Accused-Appellant had hit his head with an iron rod from

behind. The witness noted an injury on the back of the head of the

deceased.

The Police had taken steps to admit the deceased to the hospital

which was adjoining the Police Station. In the same evening witness Karolis

came to Police to lodge a complaint regarding an assault on his son but

was directed by the Police to stay with the deceased at the hospital.

Prosecution also called witness Jayasena who stated in his evidence

that one evening he heard from Rasika (wife of the deceased) that the

deceased had fallen into the precast canal and sustained injuries. Instead of

rushing to canal, the witness went in search of a three-wheeler and

thereafter only went to see the deceased. He also saw the deceased was

seated near the canal, but the witness did not observe any wetness in the

clothing of the deceased. When asked as to what happened to him, the

deceased merely replied that he fell down. The deceased had no apparent

discomfort at that time and had thereafter walked with them for about half

a mile, along the canal, towards the hospital before he sat down for the

second time.

4

PC 2092 Priyantha had recorded a statement of the Accused-

Appellant and had thereafter recovered an iron rod, that had been buried

under a patch of dried grass of his back garden, upon him pointing out the

place.

Judicial Medical Officer Susantha Kumara stated in his evidence that

during the post mortem examination of the body of the deceased, he had

observed ten external injuries. In his opinion, the death of the deceased

was due to a head injury by a blunt weapon, which had resulted in a

fractured the skull bone and damaged underlying brain tissues. This

particular injury (injury No.10), which he described as a necessarily fatal

injury, could be a result of an attack on the head from behind using a

weapon similar to an iron crow bar. Several abrasions were also noted by

the expert witness on the body of the deceased. After examining the iron

rod that had been recovered upon the information provided by the

Accused-Appellant, the expert witness expressed the opinion that the fatal

injury that was observed on the head of the deceased, could have caused

by it, if attacked with sufficient force. He further expressed the opinion

that the deceased may have walked up to a kilometre and talked after

receiving the said head injury.

It is against this backdrop of evidence, the several grounds of

appeal, as raised by the Accused-Appellant, should be considered by this

Court.

In support of the first ground of appeal, learned Counsel for the

Accused-Appellant submitted that the prosecution case is based on the

"dying declaration" of the deceased to his father Karolis that the Accused-

5

Appellant had assaulted him. The deceased had thereafter made a more

detailed statement to Sub Inspector Newton, where it was alleged that his

father-in-law had dealt a blow on his head with an iron club during an

argument with his wife.

However, the deceased had told witness Jayasena that he "fell

down". The Accused-Appellant therefore claimed that the deceased spoke

of his "fall" and that fact is in support of his claim that the deceased, due

to his state of heavy intoxication, fell on the bund of the canal resulting the

head injury to which he later succumbed. The basis of his complaint

against the judgment is that the trial Court had failed to "narrate and

analyse" the conflicting evidence of the witness Jayasena which was the

first of the dying declarations made by the deceased, a vital piece of

evidence in his favour contained in the prosecution's case. The Accused-

Appellant therefore relied on the reasoning of the judgment of this Court

in CA. 292/2014 - decided on 1st June 2018, to impress upon this Court

that he was denied of a fair trial.

This submission is based on one of the positions that had been

advanced by the Accused-Appellant during cross examination of some of

the prosecution witness. Witness Rasika who is the deceased's wife and

daughter of the Accused-Appellant was called by the prosecution. During

her evidence, she claimed that the deceased had fell on the bund of the

canal and suffered the head injury which resulted in his death

subsequently. She was treated as a hostile witness by the prosecution and

was cross examined as to the position she has taken in her previous

statements.

6

Thereafter, the Accused-Appellant presented a different position

during cross examination of the Police witnesses by suggesting them that

they had severely assaulted the deceased during the ninety-minute

interval that they have kept him in the Police Station that eyening and

when he died due to that assault, the Accused -Appellant was falsely

implicated for his death.

The submission that the trial Court had failed to consider the

evidence of the witness who was favourable to the Accused-Appellant is

not acceptable for the reason that the trial Court did in fact considered his

evidence. In the opening segment of the judgment, the trial Court noted

that he has given evidence for the prosecution. Then in the latter part of

the judgment, the trial Court refers to the evidence of this witness by

name.

It appears that the complaint of the Accused-Appellant is the" dying

declaration" in relation to his "fall" has not been considered by the trial

Court in assessing the reliability of the said "dying declaration".

Why the claim of the Accused-Appellant that the fatal injury was a

result of the "fall" of the deceased into the precast canal was rejected by

the trial Court had to be considered, in appreciating the question whether

the evidence of Piyasena is favourable to the defence as the Accused-

Appellant claims.

The expert opinion clearly negates the proposition advanced by the

Accused-Appellant that the fatal injury is a result of a "fall". The medical

witness in unambiguous terms excluded the probability of the occurrence

of such an event by expressing his opinion that for the fatal injury that

7

was observed on the head of the deceased to occur due to a fall, that fall

should be from about a height of 20 feet. Both bunds of the canal is made

of earth and only the bottom lining of the canal is made of concrete. The

canal itself is only one and half feet deep. Therefore, it is more probable

that the fatal injury suffered by the deceased is not due to a fall but due to

a deliberate attack on the head with a blunt heavy object with a

considerable force as the expert witness stated in his evidence. Therefore,

the trial Court has correctly decided this question of fact.

It is also evident from the material before the trial Court that the

Accused-Appellant in fact had a fall. Karolis received information that his

son was lying on the bund. It appears that Piyasena did not venture to ask

the deceased as to how he has sustained any injury. The mere reference to

a "fall" by the deceased is thus could well be confined to his actual fall on

the bund after receiving the head injury. The fact of making a short

statement by the deceased to Karolis and then another detailed statement

to Sub Inspector Newton is explained by the evidence led by the

prosecution.

Therefore, in view of the above considerations we hold that the first

ground of appeal of the Accused-Appellant necessarily fails.

In relation to the second ground of appeal of the Accused-

Appellant, it was submitted that the trial Court had erred on the overall

burden of the prosecution by deciding that it had proved its case even

before the Court made an attempt to analyse the case for the Accused-

Appellant. It was also submitted on his behalf that therefore the Court had

acted contrary to Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance. The Accused-

8

Appellant particularly referred to page 241 of the appeal brief where the

impugned portion of the judgment appears.

This complaint of the Accused-Appellant against the judgment is

reasonable if one were to confine the consideration of the judgment of the

trial Court only to a superficial reading of that segment of the impugned

judgment. Perusal of the judgment reveals that what the Court had

decided before proceeding to consider the defence case is the fact that the

prosecution has proved the Accused-Appellant had caused the death of

the deceased beyond a reasonable doubt. When the wording of this

sentence is compared with the wording of the last sentence of the

judgement by which the trial Court concludes that the prosecution has

proved the charge levelled against the Accused-Appellant beyond

reasonable doubt, it becomes clear what the trial Court meant in

presenting its conclusions on questions of facts throughout its judgment.

It is the style of presentation by that particular trial Court. The trial Court

would consider a particular question of fact and then concludes with the

pronouncement of what it holds in relation to that question of fact. This

feature is consistently used by the trial Court throughout the judgment.

The trial Court, in considering each facet of the" dying declarations"

made by the Deceased, repeatedly concluded that each of the particular

fact it considered had been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable

doubt. Similarly, in this particular segment too, what the trial Court

concludes is only the involvement of the Accused-Appellant in the death

9

of the deceased. It reserved its determination on the charge to the last

sentence of the 28-page long judgment and that was after considering the

evidence of the Accused-Appellant. We agree with the submissions of the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that Karolis knew whQ Mahathun

(the Accused-Appellant) is but not the Police and this explained the more

descriptive statement made to Police by the deceased.

Moving on to the last ground of appeal that the trial Court had also

erred on the burden of proof of the Accused-Appellant, it was contended

by the Accused-Appellant that he need not disprove the prosecution's case

to secure an acquittal and the trial Court was wrong in rejecting the

defence claim that the death of the deceased who died due to a fall was

foisted on the Accused-Appellant as it held that he must satisfy that the

prosecution had falsely implicated him as the person responsible for the

death of the deceased.

Perusal of the judgment revealed that the trial Court was mindful of

the legal position in relation to the Accused-Appellant. This is evident

from the pronouncement by the trial Court that the evidence adduced by

the Accused-Appellant had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case. Clearly the trial Court had not imposed any burden on

the Accused-Appellant. The basis of the complaint of the Accused-

Appellant is the wording that had been used in the analysis of defence

evidence by the trial Court. It held that if the Accused-Appellant was

falsely accused of this crime, he could have taken some action against such

an act of gross' injustice. It is obvious that the trial Court was merely

evaluating the claim of the Accused-Appellant by applying the test of

10

probability using its perception of natural conduct of a person, which it

entitles to do under Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance.

However, the judgment of the trial Court is defective in its failure to

adequately consider the lesser culpability of the Accused-Appellant.

The Court of Criminal Appeal, in delivering the judgment of The

King v Premaratne 48 N.L.R. 199, adopted the view of Viscount Simon in

Mancini v DPP 28 Criminal Appeal Reports p.73, that:-

"To avoid all possible misunderstanding, I would add that this is

far from saying that in every trial for murder, where the accused

pleads Not Guilty, the Judge must include in his summing up to

the jury observations on the subject of manslaughter. The

possibility of a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder only

arises when the evidence given before the Jury is such as might

satisfy them as the judges of fact that the elements were present

which would reduce the crime to manslaughter, or at any rate

might induce a reasonable doubt whether this was or was not the

case."

Proper discharge of this duty, by the trial Judges had been

consistently reiterated by this Court. In Saranelis Silva v Attorney General

(1997) 3 Sri L.R. 182, it was held by De Silva J (as he was then) that;

" ... it was undoubtedly the duty of the Judge in sWllming 1lp to

the Jllry to deal adeq1lately witl! any defence which might

11

I

l. I ! , { I j I I I 1 I I 1 l l i I l i I I f t I

1

j J i I j

reasonably arise on the evidence given and which would reduce

the offence from murder to culpable homicide. If there is no

evidence before the Court to reduce murder to culpable homicide,

then the Judge cannot be faulted for not inviting the Jury to

consider lesser offence."

This particular duty was again highlighted in Gamini v Attorney

General (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 236, where De Abrew Jf having considered the

judgments of King v Edwin 41 N.L.R. 345, King v Appuhamy, 41 N.L.R. 505

and King v Lanty 42 N.L.R. 317 applied the said principle and substituted

the conviction to culpable homicide not amounting to murder whether trial

Courts have convicted for murder.

In view of the third ground of appeal, this Court must consider

whether the trial Court had discharged the said duty correctly in the light

of available evidence before it.

It is already noted that the primary item of evidence against the

Accused-Appellant is the statement made by the deceased to Sub Inspector

Newton at the Police Station. The deceased claimed that he had an

argument with his wife and the Accused-Appellant had hit him with an

iron rod from behind on his head.

This statement itself contains some considerations in relation to

lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The fact that

there was an argument with the daughter of the Accused-Appellant added

an element of lesser culpability when the antecedents of the deceased is

considered. There is clear evidence that he was in a heavily intoxicated

12

state. He had a violent history as admitted by his father Karolis as the

witness had previously attempted suicide after having been assaulted by

his own son. Karolis also admitted that the couple had a troubled marriage

at the time of his son's death. There is clear evidence that there was no

prior animosity between the deceased and the Accused-Appellant. When

considered in the light of these evidence, the trial Court could have

considered the general exceptions of exceeding right of private defence and

grave and sudden provocation in view of the reasoning of the above

judicial precedents.

Clearly when the deceased had an II argument" with the Accused-

Appellant's daughter in his heavy intoxicated state, it would not have been

limited to mere verbal abuse. The use of a crow bar to attack the deceased

from behind without a warning by the Accused-Appellant is clearly

suggestive of the fact that he could well have intervened to prevent a more

serious situation. Alternatively, he may have been provoked sufficient

enough over the probable verbal and physical abuse of his.daughter by the

deceased.

In addition, the trial Court had apparently failed to consider another

more obvious factor in determining the degree of criminal liability of the

Accused-Appellant in the attack on the deceased.

Having considered the medical evidence and the nature of the fatal

injury, the trial Court had concluded that the Accused-Appellant acted

with murderous intention when inflicting the said fatal wound on the head

of the deceased by attacking him with heavy iron rod and that too with a

considerable force.

In Banda v The Queen 75 N.L.R. 459, the appeal before the Court of

Criminal Appeal against conviction for murder and the appellant before

their Lordships had inflicted only a 1/2 inch deep cut injury on the neck of

the deceased with a sword as a result of which there was a cut in the

jugular vein.

Their Lordships have set aside the conviction for murder and

proceeded to substitute one of culpable homicide as;

1/ the appellant had no murderous intention but had only the

knowledge that death would be the likely result of his act then he

would be guilty of the lessor offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder."

It is clear from the medical evidence available in relation to the

appeal before us too that the deceased had suffered only one fatal injury.

The other superficial injuries that were observed on his body have resulted

due to his fall on a rough surface after the attack on the head which may

have had left him concussed. It is also revealed from the evidence that the

attack on the deceased had taken place around 4.00 or 4.30 p.m. on

30.04.2007 while his death had occurred at about 7.20 a.m. on the following

morning. It is also correct that the fatal attack was inflicted on the back of

the head of the deceased. However, considering the facts, that only a

single fatal injury that had been inflicted on the deceased without

repetitive attacks (even though the Accused-Appellant has had the

opportunity to inflict more injuries), that the deceased had talked and

walked a considerable distance after the attack, in spite of the injury on the

back of the head, the Police keeping him in the cell over an hour due to his

high level of intoxication and, finally his death had occurred 15 hours

after the attack tends to support the position that there exists acreasonable

doubt as to whether the Accused-Appellant had entertained any

murderous intention as to satisfy the element of the offence of murder as

envisaged in Section 293 of the Penal Code.

These factors cumulatively support the proposition that the

Accused- Appellant only had the knowledge of that he inflicts an injury to

which that death would be the likely result and not the murderous

intention. In considering the basis on which the trial Court adopted to

reach the conclusion it finally did by concluding that the Accused-

Appellant had acted with a murderous intention, we are of the considered

view that the trial Court had not considered the above mentioned factors

in the proper perspective.

Therefore, we set aside the conviction entered against the Accused-

Appellant for murder and substitute with a conviction of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. In consideration of the material

available, we impose a thirteen-year term of imprisonment on the

Accused-Appellant along with a fine of Rs. 5,000.00 and if he defaults on

its payment, a six-month long term of imprisonment is imposed. In

consideration of the period of remand, we further order the Prison

15

authorities that the term of imprisonment of the Accused-Appellant,

should be commenced from the date of conviction i.e. 28-10-2011.

The relevant High Court is directed to issue a committal in line with

the above orders of this Court.

Subject to the above variations in the conviction and sentence, the

appeal of the Accused-Appellant is partly allowed.
