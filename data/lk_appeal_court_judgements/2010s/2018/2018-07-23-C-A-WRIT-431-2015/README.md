The Petitioner, the eldest surviving son of Sinhala Pedidurayalage Pina,

(herein after sometimes referred to as Pina) is claiming an exclusive right of

succession to the land in extent of 0.775 hectares, more fully described in the

schedule to the grant marked P2, in terms of rule 1 of schedule 3 of the Land

Development Ordinance (LDO). The Petitioner claims that Pina, prior to his death

has nominated his two daughters, the 6th and 7th Respondents, as successors to

0.202 hectares of land, each, as reflected in registration document marked P3,

which the Petitioner states does not conform to the minimum extent of land that

can be fragmented in terms of the said grant and therefore, the 6th and i h

Respondents cannot be held duly nominated as successors to the said portion of

4

land. The balance 0.371 hectares ofland has been transferred to the 8th Respondent

a grandson of Pina, as reflected in document marked P5.

In the said background, the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court to seek a mandate in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

contained in document marked P5, inserting the 8th Respondent in the list of

permit as a successor to the holding a share of 0.371 hectares of land and the

nomination of the 6th and 7th Respondents as his successors as reflected in

document marked P3. The Petitioner has also prayed for writ of Mandamus to

direct the 1 st to 4th Respondents to implement the decision of the 3rd Respondent to

effect nomination in favour of the Petitioner under rule 1 of schedule 3 of the

LDO, as reflected in document marked P9.

The Petitioner is challenging the said decision on the basis that the;

(a) nomination of the 6th and i h Respondents are illegal, in terms of conditions

1 and 2 of the permit marked P2.

(b) nomination of the 6th and i h Respondents are invalid as the nomination

marked P2, as successors apply only to a part of the holding.

( c) There is no valid nomination of a successor to the remaining part of the

holding.

(d) Petitioner being the eldest surviving son of the original permit holder has

priority over the 8th Respondent who is a grandson of the original permit

holder.

5

Section 52 (2), (3) and (4) of the LDO states,

52. (2) More persons than one may be nominated by the owner of a holding or

a permit-holder as successors to the holding or land alienated on the permit

provided that such nomination does not contravene the conditions of the grant or

permit.

(3) No person shall be nominated as the life-holder of a part or share of a

holding, whether divided or undivided.

(4) The nomination of a successor and the cancellation of any such

nomination shall not be made subject to any condition or defeasance.

According to the grant marked P2, fragmentation of land is possible in

terms of the conditions as stipulated. At page 30fthe grant, condition 1 states that,

the "owner shall not convey a sub-division or demarcation less than 0.203

hectares". Therefore as stipulated by the said condition the sub-division of 0.202

each to the 6th and t h Respondents is a violation of condition 1 of the grant. It is

also observed that, no person can be nominated as life-holder to a divided part or

share of less than 0.203 of a holding in the land. The transfer upon the grantees

death of the remaining 0.371 hectares to the 8th Respondent by nomination dated

03/0712003, by the 1st Respondent marked P5, contravenes condition 3 of the

grant.

6

Section 52 (2) of the LDO, require a permit holder when nominating more

persons than one as successors to the holding or land not to contravene the

conditions of the grant. Therefore, the Petitioners challenge of validity of the

nomination in terms of Section 52 (2) of the LDO should be upheld.

In terms of Section 49, if a permit holder fails to nominate a successor

during his lifetime, Section 71 provides that succession will be according to the

rules laid down in the third schedule of the Ordinance.

As noted earlier, the Petitioner is the eldest surviving son of Pina, and the

brother of 6th and 7th Respondents. The 8th Respondent, born on 24/09/1987, is the

son of Nimal Chandrasiri, Pina's eldest son, who predeceased him. Therefore, in

the absence of a valid nomination in terms of Section 49 of the LDO, succession

should devolve as prescribed by the rules in the third schedule in terms of Section

72 of the LDO. This position has been accepted by the 3rd Respondent by

document marked P9.

In the circumstances, the Petitioner, being the eldest surviving son of Pina,

should succeed to the title upon the death of the life-holder, as successor in terms

of Section 72, in the order of priority contemplated under rule 1 of schedule 3 of

theLDO.

The 6th to 8th Respondents claims that the Petitioner is gUilty of laches since

the instant application seeking to challenge the nomination of the 8th Respondent

was made on 30th April 2003.

7

The Petitioner, consistently has taken up the position that he was unaware

of an inquiry held regarding this matter by the 1st Respondent on 30104/2003, and

the subsequent nomination of the 8th Respondent as successor to the remainder of

the land.

When deciding on delay the Court should be mindful of the conduct of the

Petitioner. It is observed that, the 1st Respondent by letters marked PI4(a) and

P 14(b), copied to the 8th Respondent, has informed the 2nd Respondent about the

discovery of the irregularity of the nomination of the 8th Respondent prior to filing

this application. By letter dated 08/04/2015, marked P15, the 1st Respondent had

summoned the 8th Respondent for an inquiry. The 8th Respondent has failed to

participate at the said inquiry. In the circumstances, it is my view that taking to

account his own conduct the 8th Respondent now cannot be heard to complain

about undue delay.

In all the above circumstances, I hold that in the absence of a valid

nomination, the 6th, 7th and 8th Respondents have no right of succession to the land

more fully described in the schedule to the grant marked P2.

Therefore, the Court grants a mandate in the nature of writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision reflected in document marked P5, as prayed for in paragraph

(b), the Court also grants a writ of Mandamus directing the 1 st to 4th Respondents

to implement the decision of the 3rd Respondent contained in document marked P9

as prayed for in paragraph (c), and also declare that the appointments of 6th, 7th and

8

8th Respondents as successes to the said land are null and void, as prayed for in

paragraph Cd) of the Petition.

Petition is allowed. I make no order for costs.
