JUDGEMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

Pursuant to an application made by an employee of the 1st Accused -

respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), the

Labour Tribunal had pronounced its order on 2009-04-27 directing a

payment of Rs. 490,000 in favour of the said applicant. It is to be noted that

the 1st Respondent Company had not taken any step to challenge the said

Labour Tribunal order.

As the 1st Respondent Company failed to deposit the said sum of Rs. 490,000

in the office of the Commissioner of Labour as directed by the Labour

Tribunal. The Commissioner of Labour had instituted proceedings in the

Magistrate's Court of Colombo against the Accused -Respondent -

Respondent in terms of section 40 (1) (q) read with section 43 of the

Industrial Disputes Act No 43 of 1950 as amended.

5

Learned Magistrate by his Judgment dated 2013-02-19 had acquitted the 2nd

and 3rd Accused - Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

2nd and 3rd Respondents) holding that they were not liable to pay the said

sum of money.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Magistrate, the

Petitioner had preferred an application for revision to the Provincial High

Court of Colombo seeking a revision of the said order of the Magistrate.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge having considered the material before

Court, by her judgment dated 2015 - 04 - 02, had affirmed the judgment

dated 2013-02-19 of the learned Magistrate and dismissed the said revision

application.

It is that order that the Petitioner seeks to challenge in this revision

application before this Court.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents had taken up the position before the

Magistrate's Court that they were not directors of the said company but mere

employees. It is on that basis that they had stated that they were not liable

to pay the sum of money to be recovered.

6

This Court observes that the evidence of 4 witnesses have been recorded

before the learned Magistrate. They include an officer from the District

Labour Office, an Assistant Secretary of the Labour Tribunal - Colombo, and

an officer of the office of Registrar of Companies.

The witness who had given evidence representing the Registrar of

Companies had established that the 1st Respondent Company is still active

and that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are in fact the present directors of the

1st Respondent Company.

It is to be noted that the 1st Respondent company has been reregistered

under the provisions of the new Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Thus, the

provisions with regard to the resignation of the directors of a Company shall

apply in the instant case.

It is important to note that section 207 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007

\

has subjected itself to section 208 thereof.

The aforesaid section 208 states as follows.

Section 208

7

1) Where a company has only one director, that director may not resign

office until that director has called a meeting of shareholders to receive

notice of the resignation, and to appoint one or more new directors.

2) Notwithstanding its terms, a notice of resignation given by the sole

director of a company shall not take effect until the date of the meeting

of shareholders, called in accordance with subsection (1).

The above provision clearly shows that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents being

the last set of directors could not have legally resigned until the above

requirements are fulfilled. It has to be further noted that the evidence of the

Registrar of Companies also clearly establish that 2nd and 3rd Respondents

remain to be directors of the relevant Company. Therefore, in terms of the

applicable law, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents shall remain to be directors of

the said company.

Section 40 of the Industrial Disputes Act states that any person who being

an employer, fails to comply with any order made in respect of him by a

labour tribunal, shall be guilty of an offence. Further, section 41 thereof

states that in the case of any offence under the Act committed by a body of

8

persons and where such body is a body corporate, every director and officer

of that body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence.

Thus, it is clear that in terms of the above provisions of law, the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents being the directors of the relevant company are directly liable

for the offences committed by the said company.

It is the view of this Court that both the learned Magistrate as well as the

learned High Court Judge had failed to appreciate the above legal positions.

They had erroneously concluded that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are not

liable to pay the said sum of money due to be recovered.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to set aside the order dated 2013-

02-19 pronounced by the learned Magistrate acquitting the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents as well as the order pronounced by the learned Provincial High

Court Judge dated 2015-04-02 affirming the said judgment of the Ma~istrate.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents at no stage has taken up any other position

with regard to their liability.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to convict the 2nd and 3rd

Accused Respondents on the charges framed against them. The 2nd and 3rd

9

Accused Respondents are each sentenced to a term of 01 year RI. Each of

them is also sentenced to a fine of Rs. 5000/= with a default sentence of 03

months being attached to it. Learned Magistrate is directed to take necessary

steps to enforce this judgment.
