A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

his appeal raises the question whether a married woman enjoys the substantive

right to institute an action against her husband to vindicate her proprietary rights.

In other words, the question before this Court is whether, whilst the marriage between

the parties subsists, the' wife will have the substantive right to sue the husband for

restitution of property w\ich she alleges to be in his possession.

This was a case where the wife (the Plaintiff/Respondent who will be hereinafter

sometimes called "the Plaintiff") instituted this actiol) for restitution of moneys and

property held in trust by the husband (the Defendant/Appellant or hereinafter

sometimes called "the Defendant") and for recovery of the jewellery of the Plaintiff that

was in the matrimonial home and wrongfully held by the Defendant. The learned District

Judge of Colombo has held with the Plaintiff affirmatively stating that the wife, during the

existence of the marriage'~ does possess the right to sue the husband for recovery of her

movable and immovable property.

Whether she can institute such an action against the husband for restitution of property,

whilst conjugal rights are: still in existence, was raised as Issue No. 41, which has been

answered in the affirmative by the learned District Judge of Colombo. When this appeal

came on for argument, the learned Counsel for the Defendant/husband stated before this

Court that he would confine the appeal to only one Ql1estion and that question alone/

namely, the existence of a proprietary right in the wife to sue her spouse for restitution

of property during the subsistence of marriage.

At the very outset, I must state that the Plaintiff sought a declaration of trust in respect

of four items of property and as regards the fifth item, it was a vindication of a right to

movable property. No divorce, or judicial separation had been sought as a remedy in the

plaint. In other words, this was no matrimonial action but the plaint contained

independent causes of action rooted in trust and declat~tion of title pleaded in regard to

moveable property. So the obvious defence was taken in the answer. A forfeiture of

property cannot be granted except upon in a matrimonial action which should pray for

a divorce or a judicial separation. No suit for recovery of property will otherwise lie at

2

the instance of the wife outside Chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). In fact,

the Counsel for the Defendant mounted an argument that it is Section 615 of the CPC

which provides for settlement of property, upon divorce, or judicial separation and apart

from this remedy, there cannot be an independent cause of action available to the wife.

If at all she has to obtain her remedies in the matrimonial action. This was the first

argument of Mr. Lasith Chaminda, Counsel for the Defendant~husband. But the learned

Additional District Judge of Colombo in her judgment dated 27.09.2000 answered Issue

No. 41 in favour of the Plaintiff~wife and declared the right of the Plaintiff to sue her

husband on the basis of causes of action of trust and declaration of title. The reasoning

,. of the learned Additiona1 District Judge of Colombo is found at page 6 of the judgment

dated 27.09.2000 wherein she states that the standing of a married woman to sue must

be protected since she is -t feme sole. The judgment further states that the Defendant was

not able to show any legal basis to the contrary.

In this appeal against t~e aforesaid decision of the District Court, the learned Counsel

for the Defendant~ Appell(lnt also put forward an alternative argument. For the first time

in appeal, the Counsel raj,:;ed the argument that if at all a substantive right exists for the

wife to sue the husband during the pendency of an existing marriage, that right is

qualified by Section 23(1) of the Married Women's Property Ordinance No. 18 of 1923

which prescribes a summary procedure to be adopted in the case of a suit. Here the wife

did not adopt that procedure. She sought her remedies of trust and declaration of title by

way of regular procedure Of course this was not an argument taken before the learned

Additional District Judge but before this Court and if iLall this argument were to succeed

here, it must be based on the usual gravamen that the District Court suffered from what

Spencer Bower in the 1st edition of his book titled the Law Relating to Estoppel (1923)

called a defectus jurisdictioms, which was described by Tennekoon, C.J in Beatrice Perera

v. Commissioner of National Housing as a <patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction~see

(1974) 77 N.L.R 361 at p.366~367. Of course His Lordship the Chief Justice alluded to the

3

2nd edition of the book (1966). I must say at the outset that no such defect taints the

proceedings in the court a quo.

So the argument of the Defendant-Appellant (the husband) is twofold. In order to

vindicate her proprietary rights against her husband, a married woman must institute a

divorce action or an acticn for judicial separation. This was the issue on which the case

went to trial but the learned Additional District Judgt: disagreed on this issue with the

Defendant. The further argument that was taken befon~ this Court was that if at all, the

married woman had a right to sue the husband for a proprietary decree, she must come

to court by way of a petirion and affidavit, which is prescribed in Section 23(1) of the

Married Women's Property Ordinance No. 18 of 1923.

Each of these arguments would be gone into presently.

PART, IV: SETTLEMENT OF PROPERTIES

The pt argument related to Section 615 of the CPC. Section 615(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code (CPC) provides that the Court may make order, if it thinks fit, upon pron~uncing

a decree of divorce or separation, for the benefit of either spouse or of the children of the

marriage or of both spouses, that the other spouse shall do anyone or more of the

following:-

a) property settleme~t by conveyance either wholly or in part;

b) pay a gross sum of money;

c) pay annually or monthly such sums of money;

d) secure the payment of the sums of money so ordered above in (b) and (c) by the

hypothecation of immovable property or by execution of a bond or purchase of

insurance policy etc.

! The learned Counsel for the Defendant contended that the issue whether a wife could

institute an action agains't her husband to vindicate claims to property has been settled

in the case of Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe, which has been reported tWice-see

Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe (1989) 2 Sri LR. 180; sub nomine Premanie

Samarasinghe v. Leelaraja Samarasinghe(1990) 1 Sri LR. 31.

4

The case indulges into a history of legislative charges on settlement of property on

divorce and deals more particularly with forfeiture of property.

The argument of Counsel for the Defendant was that it is in a matrimonial action such

as divorce or judicial separation that the wife could obtain rights to her separate

property. In fact in this case the wife (the Plaintiff) sued her husband (the Defendant)

on five causes of action, which were all in relation to property. In order to understand

her action, it has to be remembered that while the marriage was subsisting, she sought

restitution of the following property:-

1) her contribution tdconstruct the matrimonial house;

2) a van purchased with her money remitted form Saudi Arabia;

3) money appropriated out of remittances sent for purchasing shops;

4) a sum of Rs.l75,OOP/- held in trust

Whilst the aforesaid four claims were based on trust, the 5th claim was in respect of

goods which the Plaintiff had brought from abroad. The plaint alleged that as the

Defendant retained these goods she was therefore s~eking a declaration that these

movable properties belonged to her. The argument on behalf of the Defendant was that

the Plaintiff could seek both a declaration of trust and title only in a case of divorce or

judicial separation. Since Section 615 of the CPC provides for settlement of property, she

would be able to secure her remedies only in a divorce action or judicial separation.

The Counsel for the Defe~ldant also drew the attention of this Court to Section 23 of the

Married Women's Property Ordinance, which reads thus:-

1. In any question between husband and wife as to the title or possession of property,

either party, or any such bank, corporation, company, public body, or society, as

aforesaid, in whose books any stocks, funds, or shares of either party may be

standing, may apply by petition in a summary way as provided for in Chapter XXIV

of the Civil Procedure Code, to the Family Court of the district in which either

party resides.

5

2. The Judge of the Fc.mily Court may make such order, direct or make such inquiry,

and award such co~ts as he shall think fit.

3. The Judge of the Family Court may, if either party so requires, hear the application

in his private room.

4. Any order so made shall be subject to appeal to the Court of Appeal, and for the

purposes of such appeal shall be regarded as an jnterlocutory order of the Family

Court.

S. Any such bank, corporation, company, public body, or society as aforesaid shall,

in the matter of suc.h application for the purposes of costs or otherwise, be treated

as a stakeholder only.

6. Every such petitior't shall bear a stamp of ten rupees and no more.

Cumulatively, Sections 23(1) and 23(2) of the Married Women's Property Ordinance

provide that when any question arises between husband and wife as to the title or

possession of property either party may apply by summary procedure to the District

Court of the area. The Dh,trict Judge may make an order that he "shall think fit",

The learned Counsel for the Defendant argued that apart from Section 61S of the CPC

and Section 23 of the M:'l~ried Women's Property Ordinance, a wife is not entitled to

invoke an independent and separate cause of action to sue her husband for a declaration

of trust and title, as the Plaintiff-wife in this case has done; the learned Counsel pointed

to Section 4 of the CPC, ,.i\Thich he said buttresses his argument.

His argument was that Section 4 authorizes only Section 61S to be used, or Section 23

! ' and no other procedure could be adopted by a spouse.

The learned District Judg:,:.has held with the Plaintiff-wife and declared that the Plaintiff

enjoys sufficient locus to institute this action. It is this finding and finding alone that was

impugned in the appeal before me.

Mr. GaminiJayasinghe, the Counsel for the Plaintiff strenuously contended that on the

question of Section 61S of the CPC, which was relied upon by the Counsel, for the -. . Defendant, a spouse need not wait till a divorce or judicial separation is filed to sue

6

another spouse in order to claim a proprietary decree. Since Section 615 applies only in

relation to a matrimonial action, it would have no application to the instant Plaintiff who

was seeking a declaration of trust and title against her husband, long before divorce

action ensued between them. Having thus set out the respective arguments let me

evaluate these arguments to appraise the propriety of the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge.

Argument based on Section 615 of the CPC

Under the old Civil Procedure Code (i.e., the Code before it was amended by law No.20

of 1977), the wording of Section 615 was as follows:~

"The court may .... on any decree absolute ..... order, that the husband shall secure to the Wife such

gross sum of money et~ .... "

In the new CPC Section 615(1) reads as follows:~

"The Court may if it thinks upon pronouncing a decree of divorce, or separation, order ... that the

other spouse shall do any of the following."

This section applies only at the conclusion of a divorce action or judicial separation.

Section 615, as Mr. GaminiJayasinghe contended, presupposes a pre~condition namely~

there must be a divorce action or a case filed for judicial 'separation. At the end of the case

the District Judge is empowered to make such orders as are prescribed in Section 615 (1)

of the CPC at the time of pronouncing a decree of divorce or judicial separation. The

Court need not wait, to make these orders, till the decree is made absolute.

I must say that in the case of a married woman who has not sought divorce or judicial

separation Section 615 has no application. If a married woman seeks to vindicat~ title to

her separate property against her husband, is she confined to Section 615 alone? I am

afraid that the cpe does not impose any such restraints. If the argument of the Counsel

for the Defendant~ Appellant has to be accepted, a married woman could perforce be

driven to file an action for divorce or judicial separation in order to seek even a

declaration of trust.

7

In my view, the very question before this Court is not res integra but is covered by

authority. In Emelda Fernando v. Elaris Fernando 63 N.LR. 416, H.W. Tambiah, J.

(with H.N.G. Fernando,J. agreeing) stated at p.418-419:-

"This question was adverted to by Schneider]. in De Silva v. De Silva (1925) 27 N. L. R.

289 at 305"306 ), He stated: "The effect of Sections 617 and 618 might be regarded either as

repealing the CommOl1 Law on the subject dealt with in rhem or of introducing new provisions

which are to stand side by side with the provisions of Common Law, not being opposed to one

another, but only alternative each to the other". The learned Judge, however, did not venture to

express his opinion on ~ his matter as the Court was only dealing with an application under Section

617 of the Civil Procedure Code and consequently it was not necessary to decide this pOint."

Having said thus, Tambic,'h,J. made some pertinent observations at page 418:-

After a careful consideration of the authorities, we are of the opinion that the common law remedy

was not abrogated as a result of the enactment of these sections, but rather the remedies enVisaged

by these sections are complementary to the action available under the common law.

However, as pOinted mit by Schneider ], in De Silva's eJse (supra at page 306), the parties

cannot have the benefit of both remedies but should elect to claim either the

remedy under the' 'Common Law or those available under the CIvil Procedure

Code. In the instant case, as the parties have not claimeq any proprietary reliefs under Sections

617 or 618 of the Civil Procedure Code, but have elected to reserve their rights to bring separate

actions, their rights u~der the commonlaw to bring separate actions have been preserved."

So the upshot of the reaspning is that the common lavv' remedies exist side by side with

Section 615 of the CPC. However, the caveat is that ejther spouse must elect to sue the

other either under the COl nmon law or the chapter on [natrimonial actions. The wife in

this case has availed herself of the right existing in common law to sue her husband and

so there is no necessity fer her to resort to Section 615 of the CPC.

I take the view that she bas locus standi in judicio in relation to these five causes of action.

Merely because Section 615 is an incidental section which provides for settlement of

property upon the conclusion of a divorce case or judicial separation, it is a preposterous 8" '

proposition to contend that Section 615 takes away the common law right of a married

woman to sue her husband for restitution of property .which she claims to be her own.

The only qualification is that she cannot enjoy both rights. She must opt for one or the

other. In the case of the Plaintiff~wife before me, there was no Hobson's choice for her,

as she had not moved towards a divorce action or judicial separation by the time she

resorted to the common b w action. Therefore she was vvithin her right to have instituted

this common law action.

I must observe that Wijeyaratne, J. was not unmindful of this proposition when he

decided (with P.R.P. Perera,]' agreeing) Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe(supra). In fact

in the case reported sub nom in (1990) 1 Sri LR. 31 at p.39, His Lordship Wijeyaratne,].

adopts with approval the dicta of Tambiah,J. in Fernando v. Fernando (supra) thus:~

, ' "In the case of Fernando v. Fernando (supra) it was held that the statutory provisions in

section 617 and 618 of the former Civil Procedure Code have not abrogated the remedies available

under the common law and that the parties should elect to claim either the remedy under the

common law or those available under the Civil Procedure Code."

Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe (supra) was a revision application arising from an action

filed by the husband for a decree of judicial separation. The wife (the Defendant in the

case) sought forfeiture of property but she had not claimed a dissolution of marriage. It

was in those circumstances that the Court of Appeal made the observation that a

forfeiture of benefits can be ordered only against a guilty spouse on proof of matrimonial

fault. In this particular case as the Defendant wife had'not counterclaimed for a divorce

or a separation, it was not open to her to raise issues on forfeiture.

The ratio of Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe (supra) would not apply to the case before

me since this is not a divorce action nor is it an action br judicial separation.

In any event, the learned Judges in Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe (supra) did not differ

from Emelda Fernando v. Saris Fernando (supra), which preserved the common law

right of a married women to sue her husband for restitution

9

It could thus be observed that the learned Judges in Samarasinghe v. Samaasinghe

(supra) have not differed from Fernando v. Fernando (supra). So much for the common

law-the judge made law on this issue.

Next I get on to advert to a stronger argument, which is founded in statute to afford locus

standi to a married WOmaJ:L

Section 18 of the Married Women's Property OrdinG,lnce, No 18 of 1923

Section 18 of the Married Women's Property Ordinance states as follows:-

"Every woman, whether married before or after this Ordinance, shall have in her own name

against all persons whomsoever, including her husband, the same civil remedies, and also

(subject, as regards her husband, to the proviso hereinafter contained) the same remedies and

redress by way of cr6ninal proceedings, for the protecrion and security of her own separate

property, as if such property belonged to her as a feme-sole, but, except as aforesaid, no husband

or Wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort."

\ A stronger case for affording a married woman legal standing to sue her husband lies in

Section 18 (1) of the Marr:ed Women's Property Ordinance which accords her locus standi

in judicio in relation to ch;J remedies except a suit in delict.

It must be remembered tLlt when the Plaintiff instituted this action against the husband

in trust and declaration oE title to movable property, the case was based on equitable title

(trust) and common law dtle (declaration of title to movable property). The words "civil

remedies" in Section 18 oi the Married Women's Propec-ty Ordinance would include both

an equitable relief such as trust and common law relief such as declaration of title. , ' I would recall the words of T ambiah, J. in Emelda Fernando v. Elaris Fernando (supra)

where the learned Judge t ommented that the common Jaw remedy of suing the husband

at the instance of the \\,ife has not been abrogated by the enactment of statutory , provisions such as Sectio1 617, and 618 of the old Civil Procedure Code.

In my view, Tambiah,j. must be taken to have had in mind even a remedy fot trust in the

words "common law remedies". In any event, as I said before, Section 18 of the Married

10

Women's Property Ordinance of 1923 which refers to civil remedies would encompass

all civil remedies, one could conceive of including a cause of action based on trust.

Thus I conclude that Section 18 expressly permits a married woman to sue her husband

for civil remedies notwithstanding the fact that they remain married to each other and

the learned Additional District Judge was not in error when she answered Issue No. 41

in the affirmative and stated that the Plaintiff in this case had validly instituted this case

, against her husband on the five causes of action.

Section 23 (1) of the Ma~ried Women's Property Or~inance

Section 23 (1) was invoked by the Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant for the 1st time

in appeal to contend that the Plaintiff must have moved court by way of summary

procedure. Instead she initiated the action by plaint.

InJayewardene v. Jayev,ardene nee Pereira (1980) 2 Sri L.R 114 the Court of Appeal

considered the question whether a claim could be maintained under Section 23 of the

Married Women's Property Ordinance to recover a dowry of Rs.lO,OOO/- which was

. , alleged to have been han~ed over to the Petitioner-wife at the time of her marriage and

spent by the Respondent-husband during the marriage. The husband denied having

received this money and the Counsel for the Respondent husband raised the preliminary

objection that the wife was not entitled to claim the said sum under Section 23 of the

Ordinance for the reason, that the section is confined oaly to any question as to "title or

possession of property" and not to any dispute where the question has first to be decided

whether in fact a dowry in that sum was given. In oth~r words the objection was that

an action could be maincained undtr section 23 only if the property in dispute was

traceable or identifiable.

Abdul Cader, J. (with Victor Perera, J. agreeing) citing cases decided under the

corresponding English Law provision namely Section J7 of Married Women's Property

Act 1882 held that the property in dispute should be identifiable or traceable before the

Court makes an order.

11

The Court however did not express a view on the am:bit of Section 23 of the Married

Women's Property Ordinance. Is the District Judge's power to make such orders as "he

shall think fit" completeiy unfettered? In the English courts two views have been

expressed on the ambit of the corresponding section.

The first view is that the jurisdiction of the court over family assets is discretionary and

transcends all rights wh,::ther legal or equitable and enables the court to make such

orders as it thinks fit-see Hine v. Hine (1962) 3 All E.R. 345. This view was expressed

clearly in Jansen v. Jansen (1965) 3 W.LR. 875 when Lord Denning stated that the

section "gives right where none before existed and gives a remedy where before there

was none"- at p.882.

The view that has been found acceptable in the House of Lords, however, is the second

view which is that the section does not give a judge the power to vary existing property

rights but merely gives rum the power to deal in a sum~ary way with disputes relating

to title and possession. Tlie substance of this view is that section 17 is a purely procedural

section which does not epable a court to confer any ne:" substantive rights on either of

the spouses. It merely prl'vided a summary method of determining questions of title and

possession between husband and wife-see National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth

(1965) 2 All ER 472; (1965) 3 \tVLR 1; (1965) A.C.l17S.

It is felt that the first view, though attractive because it vests in the court the kind of

power which would en~ble it to effect a just and E:quitable solution in relation to

property rights arising between husband and wife, cannot be supported for two reasons.

, Firstly it is difficult to contemplate that a court would have been vested with the power

to alter existing property rights in summary proce~dings. Secondly, if this. view is

accepted it makes a drast.ic inroad into the Common Law rights of property. Under well

established principles of construction, an interpretation which has this effect ought not

to be adopted unless the enactment clearly bears that meaning-see Tarr v. Tarr (1972) 2

All E.R. 295.

In any event the powet given under Section 23 c3.pnot be exclusive. A summary

procedure may be incapable of resolving equitable disputes such as a plea for a

.lL

declaration of trust and in the circumstances as the Section itself states, it is only

permissive in that a party is at liberty to choose this procedure at his election, because

the section contains these words " .......... may apply by petition ........ ". This shows that Section

23 is not an exclusive aVenue for vindicating title and possession. Even the Court of

Appeal has asserted that this procedure is not available when the property sought to be

vindicated has lost its idtntity-Jayewardene v.Jayewardene nee Pereira (supra). It is

noteworthy that some causes of action of the Plaintiff "were based on recovery of money

which were not traceable and identifiable proceeds. Therefore the argument of <;::ounsel

for the Defendant that the Plaintiff must have used only summary procedure fails. The

adoption of a regular pro'cedure raises no jurisdictional issue and one need not go into

the question of a patent or latent want of jurisdiction which I referred to at an anterior

part of this judgment.

So in a nutshell I would hold that a married woman enJoys locus standi in judicio to sue her

husband in four ways in order to obtain a proprietary decree.

1. She enjoys the cO',nmon law right to institute action against him-see Emelda

Fernando v. Elaris Fernando 63 N.L.R 416-Tambiah, J; Premanie Samarasinghe

v. Leelaraja SamaJ'asinghe(1990) 1 Sri L.R. 31.

2. Section 18 of the ~~arried Women's Property Ordinance gives a statutory right to

a married woman to sue anyone including her husband.

3. Section 615 of the CPC enables a married woman to claim restitution of property

but the relief woul~ be granted only in a divorce action or judicial separation.

All these modes of vindication are alternative in that it is open to a married woman to

choose anyone of them tp reclaim her property subject of course to the caveat that as

13

between (1) and (3) there, has to be an election on her part as to which remedy would be

sought.

\ In the circumstances I hold that the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo

arrived at the right detqmination when she conclud~d that the Plaintiff in this case

enjoyed the standing to institute this action against her husband during the subsistence

of the marriage, as the SO'lrces of that jurisdiction on the facts and circumstances of this

case lie in common law and statute namely Section 18 of the Married Women's Property

i Ordinance. This was the only question of law around which this appeal was argued and

while affirming the judgment of the District Court of Colombo dated 27.09.2000, I

proceed to dismiss the appeal.
