Heard submissions of Counsel for the Accused- Appellant and the

I : 1 ; I ,.

the 1 st Count and on the 2nd count he had been charged under Section

296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code. He had been charged

under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code on the 3rd

count. After trial, he was convicted on the 1 st and the 3rd counts and

acquitted from the 2nd count. On the 1st count he has been sentenced to

a term of 06 months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/= had been

imposed with a default sentence of 06 weeks imprisonment, in addition

he has been ordered to pay a sum of Rs.7500j= as compensation to

prosecution witness No.2 with a default sentence of 06 weeks

imprisonment. He was convicted for culpable homicide not amounting

to murder on the 3rd count and sentenced to a term of 08 years

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1000 j - with a default sentence of 06

months imprisonment, in addition he has been ordered to pay a sum of

Rs. 500,000/ =as compensation to prosecution witness No.7 with a

default sentence of 02 years Rigorous Imprisonment.

Considering the submissions of Counsel for the accused-appellant

and the learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondent, we

decide to back date the sentence of 8 years imprisonment imposed on the

3rd count to the date of conviction which is 19.12.2013. We decide to

enhance the default term of 02 years given in Count No.3 to a term of

04 years. All the sentences should run concurrently other than the

3

default sentences. The default term of 04 years imprisonment with

regard to the compensation should run consecutively. We affirm the

conviction. Subject to the above variations in the sentence, the appeal is

dismissed.
