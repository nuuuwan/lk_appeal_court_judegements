The Petitioners, have invoked the jurisdiction of this court, to seek a

mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus to compel the Respondents to remove

all unauthorized obstructions in the proposed roadway on Vimukthi Mawatha,

Stage II, Anuradhapura, and to compel the said Respondents to demarcate the

proposed roadway marked "H" in plan No. AalNPE/2012/618-619, marked X6,

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "alternative plan"). The Petitioner has

also sought a mandate in the nature of writ of Mandamus to compel the 3rd and 4th

Respondents to hold a Land Kachcheri in terms of Section 20, of the Land

Development Ordinance.

.. 3

The Petitioners submit that after receiving notice in terms of Section 42A,

of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, several parties including the 5th Respondent,

failed to demolish unauthorized structures obstructing the proposed roadway and

the 1 st and! or 2nd Respondents have failed to take necessary steps to have the said

unauthorized structures demolished in terms of the said Act.

After several failed attempts by the Petitioners to resolve this issue, the 2nd

Respondent by letter dated 20104/2012, marked X5(b), has notified the 2nd

Petitioner that the matter would be resolved by an alternative plan, as proposed by

the Urban Development Authority, (UDA). The said alternative plan drawn and

proposed by the UDA has been approved by the planning committee of the 1 st

Respondent. By letter dated 10/09/2013, marked X7(b), the 2nd Respondent has

approved the said plan for implementation. As pleaded in paragraph 22, the

Petitioners through their Attorney-at - Law has made a demand from the 2nd

Respondent by letters of demand marked XII and X12, to effectuate the said plan

forthwith.

However, it is observed that, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 10/09/2013,

has informed the said Attorney -at-Law, that the Municipal Council

Anuradhapura would take appropriate steps to demolish the unauthorized

structures, once the Urban Development Authority submits the alternative plan.

Presently, the alternative plan is with the planning committee, of the 1 st

Respondent, pending approval.

-4

The Respondents raised a preliminary objection to this application, on the

basis that the Petitioners have failed to add the necessary parties to this Petition

and therefore, the action should be dismissed in limine.

In the case of Wijeratne Vs. Ven Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero and

others, (2011) 2 SLR 258, the Supreme Court considered the effect of necessary

parties to an application, where the court held, that;

"those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ application

should be made respondents to the application"

In paragraph 4, the petitioner admits that there were several disputes

between the residents of Vimukthi Mawatha, Stage II, Anuradhapura, in relation to

the road reservation and the unauthorized constructions on the said road

reservation. The 5th Respondent is one of the residents of Vimukthi Mawatha,

Stage II. According to the pleadings of the Petitioner, it is observed that including

the 5th Respondent there are several other residents who are obstructing the

demolition of the unauthorized structures on the proposed roadway. This is

observed in the 3rd paragraph of letter dated 31110/2013, written by the 3rd

Respondent to the 4th Respondent marked X8. Therefore, the relief sought by the

Petitioners would not only affect the 5th Respondent, but several other residents of

Vimukthi Mawatha, Stage II, who are not before Court. The Petitioner has

identified only the 5th Respondent as a resident who was served with a notice in

terms of Section 42A, of the Municipal Councils Ordinance. Failure to identify all

5

necessary parties, will not only leave the dispute unresolved but also create

multiple avenues of litigation from affected parties.

However, it is important at this stage to consider whether, the Petitioners

have a legal right to compel the Respondents to clear all obstructions from the

roadway, according to plan marked X6, in terms of the relevant statutory

provISIOns.

It is an admitted fact that the Petitioners, the 5th Respondent and all other

parties in possession of allotments of land in Vimukthi Mawatha, occupy

allotments of land, unlawfully. As pleaded in paragraph 3 of the Petition,

subsequent to an inquiry held by the 3rd Respondent in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 (as amended), the Petitioner and several

other parties have been considered to be given permits in terms of Section 19 of

the said Act. However, as of now, no permits under the said Act have been issued

to any of the parties. The Petitioners submit that, the disputes between residents of

Viniukthi Mawatha regarding the road reservation and unauthorized constructions

have not been referred to a land Kachcheri under the Land Development

Ordinance. It is observed that, by this application the Petitioners are not

challenging the non-granting of the permits to the said lands nor have the

Petitioners placed on record any supporting evidence for the Court to make any

direction to hold a Land Kachcheri to sought out the issue of land allotments.

6

The Petitioners are seeking to compel the relevant Authorities to remove

unauthorized obstructions in order to proceed with the proposed roadway.

However, in the absence of a clear legal right to occupy the land allotments, the

Petitioner cannot compel the authorities to perform a specific statutory duty to

demolish the said unauthorized structures.

It is observed, that the Petitioners have no clear legal right to compel the 1 st

and 2nd Respondents, to remove unauthorized structures obstructing the roadway,

since the Petitioners are not in lawful possession of the said allotments of land.

Their rights, if any, would be decided upon the awarding of a permit, in terms of

the Land Development Ordinance. Therefore, there is no legal duty thrust upon the

1 st and the 2nd Respondents to remove unauthorized obstructions on the proposed

roadway. However, the 1 st and 2nd Respondents are directed to speedily resolve the

issue of demolition of the unauthorized structures in Vimukthi Mawatha, Stage II

according to the Law.

It is noted that in spite of the undertaking given to court, the Petitioners

have failed to file written submissions in support of this application.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
