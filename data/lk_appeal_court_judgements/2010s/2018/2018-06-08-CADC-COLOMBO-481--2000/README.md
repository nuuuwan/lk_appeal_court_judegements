Counsel Nimal Weerakkody for the Plaintiff-Appellant

Lal Matarage instructed by T. S. Jayathilaka

for the Respondent

Argued &

Decided on 20.01.2017

A. H. M. D. Nawaz, J.

Mr. Nimal Weerakkody, Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant submits that this Court

can make a decision on the available evidence that has already been presented

before the District Court of Colombo. He would not make any oral submissions.

Mr. Lal Matarage Attorney-at-Law for the Respondent proceeded to make his

submissions on the evidence that has already been led before Court.

It is quite clear that this was a rei vindicatio action as evidenced in the plaint

dated 18.11.1987. The Plaintiff-Appellant had prayed for a declaration of title to

the land depicted in the schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the Defendant and

all those who were holding under him. This Court bears in mind the trite principle

that is applicable in rei vindicatio actions namely 'in a rei vindicatio action the

burden is on the Plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on by him. The

Defendant need not prove anything" -see Dharmadasa v. Jayasena [1997] 3 SLR

327. In a rei vindicatio action, the cause of action is based on the sole ground of

violation of the right of ownership. In such an action proof is required that:

1

(i) The plaintiff is the owner of the land in question, i.e., he has the dominium,

and

(ii) That the land is in the possession of the defendant. (Voet 6. 1. 34).

Vide the pronouncement Lawrie A.C.J in Silva v. Hendrick Appuhamy 1 NLR 13

at 18-"When a plaintiff comes into Court praying for a declaration of title, he must

possess at that time the title which he asks the Court to declare to be his". The

above dictum was followed in the case of Ahamadulevve v. Sanmugam 54 NLR

467. It is only when this burden is satisfactorily discharged by the Plaintiff, then

the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that his possession is lawful. Has the

Plaintiff-Appellant in this case established his title to this property? The Plaintiff

pleaded that by deed bearing No 828 and dated 5th September 1986, which was

attested by L.V. Emmanuel de Silva, Notary Public, he obtained a transfer of the

land in question. Even though he alleged that he obtained a transfer of the land in

question, the acquisition of this deed has been challenged by the Defendant. In

those circumstances it becomes imperative in terms of section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance to summon at least one attesting witness to be called to prove due

execution of the deed in question. Even though the brother of the Plaintiff was

summoned to give evidence as to the due acquisition of this deed, there seems to

be inconsistency inter se between the Plaintiff and his witness as to whether the

acquisition did take place. Both the Plaintiff and the original Defendant claimed

title to the property in dispute through the same source namely one J.A. Anthony

Mersalin de Saram and the Plaintiffs Deed bearing No. 828 was attested on 5th

September 1986, whilst the original Defendant's Deed bearing No. 273 was

registered on 11th April 1980. It would appear that the transfer of the property in

dispute to the Defendant had been effected more than 6 years prior to the

2

execution of the Plaintiffs Deed. Since the said J .A. Anthony Mersalin de Saram

had lawfully transferred his title to the Defendant in 1980, he could not have had

any title whatsoever to convey to the Plaintiff in 1986. It was the submission of

Mr. La! Matarage that the purported transfer to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 828 on

5th September 1986 could not have vested the Plaintiff with any title.

Then the question arises as to whether the Plaintiff established his title to the land

in question. It was a declaration of title that the Plaintiff sought and the

Defendant challenged the Plaintiffs Deed No. 828 dated 5th September 1986 as a

fraudulent deed. In the circumstances it is incumbent upon the Plaintiff to

establish his deed as a genuine deed and prove his title. Due execution of the deed

has to be established and I had occasion to extensively deal with the requirements

of due execution of a deed in Hirumuthugodage Dhanawathie v. Bentara

Vidanalage Nandasena (CA Case No 303/2000 (F) decided on 26.09.2016) and

the pith and substance of the decision is that the due execution could be

established by adducing the evidence of at least one attesting witness in terms of

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. In W(Jegoonetilleke v. W(Jegoonetilleke

60 N.L.R 560 Basnayake C.J observed that a notary who attests a deed is an

attesting witness within the meaning of that expression in Sections 68 and 69 of

the Evidence Ordinance. Neither the Notary nor the Transferor was led by the

Plaintiff to discharge his burden. This failure on the part of the Plaintiff becomes

more pronounced in light of the fact that the Plaintiffs Deed bearing No. 828 and

dated 5th September 1986 was marked subject to proof. This would only go to

show that no title ever passed to the Plaintiff.

Having thus culpably failed to establish due execution and title, the Plaintiff failed

to produce any document to establish that he had registered the deed. The

3

Plaintiff was cross examined on due registration of the deed in the proper folio but

the Plaintiff could not offer any proper answer to these questions. In other words

there was no proper folio in which the purported deed had been registered.

As opposed to this position, there is evidence that the Defendant produced the

correct folios which made cross references to the previous folios in which the Deed

of the Transferor and those of his predecessors had been registered -see V5

marked at the trial. The failure to offer this evidence compels this Court to draw

an adverse inference against the Plaintiff in terms of Illustration (f) to section 114

of the Evidence Ordinance.

This court also draws in aid Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance which is

quite explicit on the allocation of an overall burden.

"Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability

dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those

facts exist.

When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the

burden of proof lies on that person. "

Illustration (b) which is analogous to some extent to the instant case states;

"A desires a court to give judgment that he is entitled to certain land in the

possession of B by reason of facts which he asserts, and which B denies to

be true.

A must prove the existence ofthosefacts."

Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance is premised on the Latin tag-"Ei qui

affirmat 'non ei qui negat, incumbit probatio-the proof lies upon him who

4

ajfirms, not upon him who denies. It is expressed in the commonplace dictum-

one who asserts must prove.

Section 101 places the legal burden of proof on the party who asserts the

existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact. Section 101 of the Evidence

Ordinance obligates a party seeking judgment in the suit to prove his case. He has

to prove it to the standard required as defined in Section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance. In a civil case it would be on a balance of probabilities-for a classic

exposition of "balance of probabilities", see per Denning J. in Miller v. Ministry of

Pension. 1

Thus I take the view that the Plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proving his

title within the above parameters-see another formulation of this burden in cases

such as Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy 65 N.L.R and Hameed v.

Weerasinghe (1989) 2 Sri.LR 271. In the circumstances, the learned District

Judge of Colombo has reached a correct finding on the relevant issues before him

and this Court finds no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

i District Judge of Colombo dated 18th August 2000 and I proceed to affirm the

judgment and dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant. \
