The accused appellant was indicted for committing offences under Sections 354

and 364(2}{e) of the Penal Code as amended, on one Godamini Vithanage Pumie

Shashika/a, an under aged person. After trial, he was convicted on both counts and

was imposed sentences of 3 years and 12 years of rigorous imprisonment respectively

on the said two counts to run concurrently. He was also ordered to pay Rs. 250,000.00

as compensation with a default sentence of one year RI.

The accused appellant has preferred this appeal against his conviction and

sentence.

Learned Counsel for the accused appellant, at the hearing of his appeal,

submitted that;

i. the trial Court was in error when it failed to consider the evidence of the

prosecutrix as infirm and unreliable,

II. the trial Court was in error when it considered the medical evidence as

evidence of corroboration.

It is contended by the accused appellant, in support of his first ground of appeal,

that the prosecutrix complained of the alleged act only after a three year delay and

she has lied on oath as her claim of complaining to her aunt, soon after the incident,

is negated by the relevant witness. It is also contended that the medical evidence did

2

l I I t

not support the version of events as presented by the prosecutrix and, in addition,

when her conduct is taken into account in the light of these factors made it unreliable.

Learned President's Counsel for the Respondent, pointed out that the trial

Court has opted to believe Shashikala's claim of complaining to her aunt, soon after

the incident. He contended that owing to the nature of the relationship of her aunt to

the accused appellant, it is probable that her aunt was reluctant to complain the

incident to the authorities. He further added that Shashikala has made use of the

opportunity to lodge a formal complaint to the authorities, when such opportunity

presented itself for the first time after three years since the incident, when she was

accompanied to the Police by her parents.

The case presented by the prosecution was that Shashikala was related to the

accused appellant and was asked by him to deliver a radio set to a nearby house, when

she was on her way to a nearby boutique. The house was not occupied by anyone, but

Shashikala has seen the accused appellant in that house prior to this incident. She

complied with the request of the accused appellant. When she entered the house, the

accused appellant, who was already in the house has grabbed her and has had sexual

intercourse with her forcibly, after pushing her on to a sofa.

Upon returning home, Shashikala disclosed the incident to her aunt, with whom

she lived for some time, as her parents had a troubled relationship. Her aunt Priyanthi,

has then told Shashikala that she would inform her mother and further instructed her

not to disclose it to anyone else. However, her aunt Priyanthi, in her evidence has

denied this claim and said that she came to know about the incident only at the Police

Station, when Shashikala was brought to it by her parents, when she attempted to run

away from their home that very morning.

Learned High Court Judge, having accepted the sequence of events as narrated

by Shashikala as credible and truthful evidence, opted not to rely on the denial of

Priyanthi on the basis that it is apparent that she has attempted to shield the accused

appellant from this allegation.

The evidence led before the trial Court by the prosecution revealed that

Shashikala is Priyanthts 5 sister's daughter while the accused appellant is her

husband's sister's son. The accused appellant too was under her care at some point of

time as his mother, her sister, has decided to terminate her marriage with the father

of the accused appellant. Shashikala's father, who usually under the influence of

alcohol, would beat her severely even if someone were to follow her in the village. Her

parents had a troubled relationship and as already noted was under the care of her

aunt, at the time of the incident.

It is also revealed that Shashikala is a stubborn child and would act on her own

against the advice of elders, even though she was yet a minor.

There was also evidence led by the prosecution, that Shashikala's grandfather

has seen her and the accused appellant in a compromising position. It is not clear

whether this incident took place before or after the complained act of sexual

intercourse. It could well be that it happened after the incident of alleged rape as

Shashikala has admitted in her evidence that she was in a relationship with the

accused appellant for some time, subsequent to the complained act. Although this

incident was seen by her grandfather, no further action was pursued as there was no

"damage".

These items of evidence are a clear indication of the attitude of the elders, in

relation to the complaint made by Shashikala.

Her mother, in her evidence also related an incident where a Police constable

has made an attempt to ravish Shashikala and when she complained it to Police she

was chased out with threatening utterances of obscenities. In these circumstances, it

is reasonable to infer that all these factors could well have influenced the concerned

parties to adopt the approach that they eventually did, to the complaint of Shashikala,

in relation to this incident.

Shashikala was born on 14th February 1996 and she was about 12 years and 7 months

of age when the complained incident took place. She lived in Tract No. 4 of

Rajanganaya of Tambuttegama Police area and the place of the incident, as shown by

Shashikala~ is located about 17 km from the Police Station.

When these factors are considered against the claim of Shashikala that she did

complain of the incident to her aunt soon after but there was no further action by her

aunt, I am inclined to agree with the submissions of the learned President's Counsel

for the Respondent that although three years have elapsed when the incident was

formally reported to Police, the long delay is explained and justified.

It is unreasonable to expect a young girl, who was brought up in a village setting,

to be bold enough to go directly to the Police, when she reported her horrifying

experience to her elder who failed to take any action owing to her close relationship

to the accused appellant. The parties lived in a vi "age community and her aunt's

reluctance to initiate official investigation could be understood as it is a probable and

natural reaction owing to considerations of societal repercussions. Priyanthi has

treated Shashikala with kindness by providing her a refuge when she could no longer

stay with her parents. It is probable that Priyanthi opted to safeguard futures of both

Shashikala and accused appellant by simply allowing the incident to forget over the

passage of time. Therefore, the trial Court's finding on the reliability of Priyanthi's

denial of informing the incident by Shashikala could not be faulted.

In CA 115/2006 (Court of Appeal minutes of 28.07.2011), Ranjith Silva J quoted

Samarakoon v Republic 0/ Sri Lanka (2004) 2 Sri L.R. 209 which in turn cited and Paulin

de Croose v The Queen 71 NLR 169, where it was held by Fernando J that;

"Just because the statement of a witness is belated the Court is not

entitled to reject such statement .... If the reasons for the delay

adduced by the witness are justifiable and probable the trial judge

is entitled to act on the evidence of the witness who had made a

belated statement. "

Viewed in this context, it is my considered view that there is no delay in reporting the

incident by Shashikala to another as she did report it to her aunt soon after. The delay

is therefore confined to her making a formal complaint. In view of the foregoing, it is

further held that her delay in making a formal complaint to Police is sufficiently

explained and justified.

Whether the prosecutrix has told her aunt about the act of the accused

appellant soon after the incident is clearly a question of fact. It is clear that the learned

trial Judge, having observed the demeanour and deportment of the prosecutrix, has

opted to accept her evidence as truthful and reliable, after evaluating it with the

already established tests in assessing testimonial trustworthiness of a witness.

A question of fact or a primary fact; which has been decided by a trial Court,

which had the priceless advantage of observing the witness, should not ordinarily be

disturbed by an appellate Court, unless it could be termed as a perverse finding.

In the judgment of Fradd v Brown & Co. Ltd., 20 NLR 282, it was held;

" ... immense importance attaches, not only to the demeanour of the

witnesses, but also in the course of the trial and the general

impression left on the mind of the Judge present, who saw and

noted everything that took place in regard to what was said by one

or other witness. It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so

explicit, upon a point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of

Appeal, because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage

which a Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as

contrasted with any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn

from paper or from narrative of those who were present. It is very

rare that, in questions of veracity so direct and so specific as these,

a Court of Appeal will over-rule a Judge of first instance. /I

The judgment of De Silva and Others v Seneviratne and Another (1981) 2 Sri

L.R. 7 is also an instance where the Court of Appeal considered the question as to the

circumstances under which an appellate Court should interfere with findings of facts

made by a trial Court. After referring to a long line of authorities on the point, it held

that;

"On an examination of the principles laid down by the authorities

referred to above, it seems to me: that, where the trial judge's

findings on questions of fact are based upon the credibility of

witnesses, on the footing of the trial judge's perception of such

evidence, then such findings are entitled to great weight and the

utmost consideration, and will be reversed only if it appears to the

appellate Court that the trial judge has failed to make full use of the

"priceless advantage" given to him of seeing and listening to the

witnesses giving viva voce evidence, and the appellate Court is

convinced by the plainest consideration that it would be justified in

doing so that, where the findings of fact are based upon the trial

judge's evaluation of facts, the appellate Court is then in as good a

position as the trial judge to evaluate such facts, and no sanctity

attaches to such findings of fact of the trial judge: that, if on either

of these grounds, it appears to the appellate Court that such

findings of fact should be reversed, then the appellate Court "ought

not to shrink from that task"

Perusal of the proceedings reveal that it was the same trial Judge who has

recorded the evidence of the prosecutrix and delivered the judgment by which the

accused appellant was found guilty. As the issue of credibility of the prosecutrix has

been decided in her favour, her claim of complaining to aunt too was also accepted by

the trial Court as a truthful and reliable item of evidence. In the light of the above

considerations, I am unable to term this finding of fact by the trial Court as a perverse

finding.

The other complaint of the accused appellant that the trial Court was in error

when it considered the medical evidence as evidence of corroboration is apparently

based on the learned High Court Judge's observation in his judgment that Shashikala~s

evidence is '1urther confirmed/corroboratedN by the medical evidence.

This observation is made by the trial Court when it referred to the evidence of

the medical witness, who said that he saw an old healed tear in the 6 o'clock position

in the hymen, when he examined the prosecutrix. The trial Court has utilised this item

of evidence supporting the prosecution claim that there was vaginal penetration at

some point of time. Learned Counsel for the accused appellant submitted that when

the prosecutrix has admitted having had sexual relations subsequent to the incident,

the fact that there was a tear in the hymen does not add credence to her claim. More

importantly, corroboration should be by an item of evidence that connects the

accused appellant to the alleged count of rape. Since the medical evidence could not

be considered as such in these circumstances, the learned trial Judge's reliance on this

item of evidence as "corroboration" is contrary to applicable law.

In Rajaratnam v Republic 0/ Sri Lanka 79(1) NLR 73, the then Supreme Court

quoted the following passage from the judgment of King v Athukorale 50 NLR 256,

reproducing it with the observation that "The law in regard to the need of

corroboration in rape cases is well settled. N

"The corroboration which should be looked for in cases of this kind

is some independent testimony which affects the accused by

connecting or tending to connect him with the crime, and it is

settled law that although the particulars of a complaint made by a

prosecutrix shortly after the alleged offence may be given against

the person ' as evidence of the consistency of her conduct with her

evidence given at the trial,' such complaint' cannot be regarded as

corroboration in the proper sense in which that word is understood

in cases of rape and it is misdirection to refer to it as such' such

8

evidence is not corroboration because it lacks the essential quality

of coming from an independent quarter. "

As noted earlier on in this judgment, the trial Court utilised the medical

evidence to arrive at a finding that it is not inconsistent with the prosecution version.

It clearly found that the sequence of events, as narrated by the prosecutrix in her

evidence, is consistent with the history given to the medical officer at the time of her

examination. These findings are in line with the law as laid down in the judgements of

King v Athukorale (ibid) and Perera vAG (2012) 1 Sri L.R. 69.

In addition, the trial Court has also utilised the observations made by the

medical witness after examining genitalia of the prosecutrix as it was observed that

she had an old hymeneal tear at 6 o'clock position as an item of evidence which

corroborated the assertion of penile penetration.

Learned trial Judge was mindful of the evidentiary value of each of these items

of evidence. He correctly used the short history given by the prosecutrix, only to

evaluate the consistency of her evidence and not as an item of corroboration. He then

used the medical evidence of hymeneal tear as an item of evidence which tends to

corroborate her evidence. In this instance an under aged unmarried girl claimed penile

penetration of her vagina. She also claimed she felt pain in her lower abdomen and

also felt blood from her vagina. The medical evidence could obviously provide

corroboration for such a claim, as there was evidence of hymeneal injury and it came

from an independent source. I am in agreement with the learned trial judge.

In Perera v AG (ibid) there was evidence that the accused and the rape victim

had gonorrhoea. Justifying an inference drawn that she may have contracted the

venereal decease from the accused himselt Court of Appeal has held that " ... This

evidence if not corroborative should at least show consistency of the evidence of the

victim.J/

In these circumstances, it could reasonably be concluded that the appeal of the

accused appellant is without merit.

9

The accused appellant, in his submissions, did not address this Court on the

sentences imposed on him. I am of the view that the sentences imposed on the

accused appel/ant are legal/y correct, reasonable and appropriate under the

circumstances.

Therefore, the conviction of the accused appel/ant on the two counts and the

sentences imposed on him upon his conviction of them are affirmed by this Court.

Accordingly the appeal of the accused appellant is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
