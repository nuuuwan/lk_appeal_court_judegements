Decided on: 05.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs instituted this action in the District Court of

Kandy seeking to partition the land depicted in the Preliminary

Plan. After trial, the learned Additional District Judge entered

Judgment partitioning the land among the two plaintiffs and the

2nd-4th defendants. Being dissatisfied with this Judgment, only

the 3rd and 4th defendants have preferred this appeal.

When this appeal came up before me for argument, learned

counsel appearing for the parties agreed to file comprehensive

written submissions instead of oral submissions. However, I

find that, except on behalf of the 2nd defendant, which I will

advert to later, no written submissions have been tendered on

behalf of the other parties including the appellants before the

given date or at least at the time of writing this Judgment. No

motion has been filed seeking extension of time.

When I read the petition of appeal, it is clear that, the only point

raised by the appellants in this appeal is that Deed No. 702,

which the 1st plaintiff traces part of his title to, and the learned

Additional District Judge has accepted as a genuine one, is a

fraudulent Deed.

3

The appellants have in their statement of claim specifically

pleaded that the said Deed is a fraudulent one and put that

matter in issue at the trial. The plaintiffs first issue is on the

due execution of the said Deed.

How a Deed shall be proved in the eyes of the law is stated in

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance, No. 14 of 1895, as

amended:

If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not

be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has

been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there

be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of

the court and capable of giving evidence.

The 1st plaintiff in favour of whom the Deed has been executed

has given evidence at the trial. He has stated in evidence that

the Notary and the two subscribing witnesses to that Deed were

dead.

If the attesting witnesses to a Deed, which includes the Notary1,

cannot be found, how the Deed can be proved is stated in

section 69 of the Evidence Ordinance:

If no such attesting witness can be found, or if the

document purports to have been executed in the United

Kingdom, it must be proved that the attestation of one

attesting witness at least is in his handwriting, and that

the signature of the person executing the document is in the

handwriting of that person.

According to section 69 of the Evidence Ordinance, if no such

attesting witness can be found, it must be proved (a) the

signature of one of the witnesses and (b) the signature of the

executant. The learned Additional District Judge has not

adverted to these two mandatory requirements when he came to

the finding that the said Deed is a valid Deed.

I carefully went through the evidence of the sole witness for the

plaintiffs, who is the 1st plaintiff, to learn that, he, in his

testimony, has not identified the signatures of the executant and

the attesting witnesses. His evidence on the execution of the

Deed is evasive.

It is the position of the plaintiffs that the executant placed her

left thumb impression instead of placing her signature on the

Deed (as she was used to) because she was ill.

However, it is interesting to note that in the original Deed, which

was marked as P1 through the evidence of the 1st plaintiff, the

thumb impression of the executant or anything written

underneath the thumb impression by the Notary cannot be seen

to the naked eye.2 That is not due to lapse of time because

writings of the other parts of the Deed are clear and readable.

The position had been the same when the original Deed was

marked in evidence at the trial Court.

The 1st plaintiff does not complain of a foul play on non-

appearance of the alleged thumb impression of the executant

and the endorsement supposedly made by the Notary

underneath the thumb impression. The 1st plaintiff has not

given any acceptable explanation on that vital matter. Nor has

2 Page 113 of the Brief.

he taken any steps to get a commission issued to the Examiner

of Questioned Documents or any other expert to examine and

report on that matter to Court.

Thereafter during the course of the cross-examination of the 4th

defendant-appellant by learned counsel for the plaintiffs, a

certified photocopy of the duplicate of the Deed has been marked

as P2 to say that in that copy, the executants thumb impression

and the endorsement of the Notary that it is the thumb

impression of the executant are visible. The 4th defendant-

appellant has not accepted that position.

The entire evidence of the 1st plaintiff regarding due execution of

the Deed is very unsatisfactory.

The 1st plaintiff in his evidence has stated that he came with the

executant, who was his grandmother, to house No.121 to sign

the Deed.3 Admittedly, the Deed has not been signed at the

Notarys office. However, the witness does not say that the

Notary and the two witnesses also came to the said house and

the executant, the two witnesses and the Notary signed the Deed

in the presence of one another, all being present together at the

same time.

In terms of section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance,

No.7 of 1840, as amended, a Deed shall be of no force or avail in

law unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party

making the same in the presence of a Notary and two or more

witnesses present at the same time and duly attested by such

Notary and witnesses.

3 Page 57 of the Brief.

The 1st plaintiff has also admitted in evidence that the

executanthis grandmother, was confined to bed and

immobilized due to paralysis at the time of the execution of the

Deed.4 Then it is not clear how and why she was brought to

house No.121 for the purpose of execution of the Deed. On the

other hand, according to the Deed, house No.121 was where she

was residing even though the 1st plaintiff in his evidence stated

that he came with the grandmother to house No. 121. It is also

noteworthy that the Notary in the attestation has stated that he

does not know the executant.

I have no reservation to conclude that the due execution of the

Deed marked P1 as contemplated in section 69 of the Evidence

Ordinance read with section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance has not been proved, and therefore the impugned

Deed marked P1 has no force or avail in law.

Let the incumbent District Judge adjust the share allocation as

if there was no such Deed and enter Interlocutory Decree

accordingly. To that extent, the Judgement of the District Court

is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs.

This leads me to consider the application of learned counsel for

the 2nd defendant-respondent made by way of a written

submission tendered to this Court after the argument date,

without sending copies to the Attorneys-at-Law of the other

parties. By that written submission, learned counsel for the 2nd

defendant-respondent moves to adjust share allocation in

respect of the Deed marked 4V1 and the subsequent Deed

marked 4V2, which the learned counsel says has wrongly been

decided by the learned Additional District Judge.

The 2nd defendant-respondent has not filed an appeal against

the Judgment of the District Court as she was entitled in law to

dovide sections 754-755 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Nor has the 2nd defendant-respondent filed objections to the

decree with seven days notice in writing of such objection to the

registered Attorney for the appellant in terms of section 772 of

the Civil Procedure Code which reads as follows:

(1) Any respondent, though he may not have appealed against

any part of the decree, may, upon the hearing, not only

support the decree on any of the grounds decided against

him in the court below, but take any objection to the decree

which he could have taken by way of appeal, provided he

has given to the appellant or his registered attorney seven

days' notice in writing of such objection.

(2) Such objection shall be in the form prescribed in paragraph

(e) of section 758.

In Solomon v. Mohideen Pathumma5 it was decided that:

Without filing an objection in terms of section 772 of the

Civil Procedure Code a party respondent to an appeal is not

entitled to attack any findings of the trial Court that are

adverse to him. The respondent must accept that

correctness of the decision which has been made against

him and on that basis, if the findings help him, try to

support the decree.

The rigidness of section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code was

somewhat relaxed in Ratwatte v. Goonasekera6 where it was

held that:

Where no cross-appeal has been filed, the plaintiff's failure

to give seven days written notice under section 772 of the

Civil Procedure Code will not entitle him to a right to take

objection to the decree. But 772 of the Civil Procedure Code

does not bar the court, in the exercise of its powers to do

complete justice between the parties, from permitting

objection to the decree even though no notice had been

given. The Court of Appeal has inherent jurisdiction to grant

or refuse such permission in the interest of justice.

A respondent not taking any objection can without filing

any cross objections support the decree not only on the

grounds decided in his favour but also by urging that the

grounds decided against him should have been decided in

his favour. He may thus challenge a finding against him

although the decree may be in his favour. But a respondent

cannot attack the decree in the appellant's favour without

filing a cross-appeal or giving notice of objections under

section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Then it is clear that when objections under section 772 are not

filed, the Court has the discretion to allow or disallow a

respondent to attack the decree. That is a threshold question. I

will leave that question for a moment and get on to the next

point.

I did not consider the merits of the application of the 2nd

defendant-respondent. However, one thing is clear. If the

application of the 2nd defendant-respondent is allowed, the

appellants are the losers or the affected parties. Then even if the

liberal approach suggested in Ratwattes case is adopted, the

application of the 2nd defendant-respondent cannot be allowed

as a respondent cannot attack the decree in the appellant's

favour without filing a cross-appeal or giving notice of objections

under section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The application of the 2nd defendant-respondent is dismissed.
