Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Matara dated

17.11.2003.

The r t Respondent-Appellant (Appellant) made an application citing the Petitioner-Respondent

(Respondent) as a party under section 18(1) of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 as

amended (Act) to obtain arrears of rent. The application was in respect of a paddy land named

tlMideliadola Aswedduma" 1 Acre 2 Roods in extent. The Appellant made the application acting

as the Viharadhipathi and Trustee of Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama. The application was

dated 01.04.1993 and the period in arrears was said to be from 1977.

The 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2 nd Respondent) held an inquiry into this application at which

the Appellant agreed to limit the claim of arrears of rent to 1993. After inquiry the 2nd Respondent

held that the Appellant was the owner of Midelladola Aswedduma and that the Respondent was

the tenant cultivator. She made further order directing the Respondent to pay the arrears of rent

set out in the order.

The Respondent sought a writ of Certiorari from the High Court of Matara to quash the said order

of the 2nd Respondent which was granted by the learned High Court Judge. Hence this appeal by

the Appellant.

The Respondent denied that Midelladola Aswedduma was owned by the Rajamaha Viharaya,

Kolawenigama. It was his position that the said paddy bnd was owned by his father Manikpurage

Uraneris who was at one time the owner cultivator and that he inherited it from his father and

continued to cultivate thereafter.

The 2nd Respondent concluded that Midelladola Aswedduma belonged to Rajamaha Viharaya,

Kolawenigama based on a document marked 01.1. She further concluded that Uraneris was a

tenant cultivator of Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama based on 01.2 which showed that one

Uraneris had signed as tenant cultivator for land called flMadakalla" belonging to the Rajamaha

'1iharaya, Kolawenigama. The 2nd Respondent further held that the Respondent had failed to

adduce any evidence of ownership to the disputed paddy land.

The learned High Court Judge concluded that the 2nd Respondent had exceeded her authority by

inquiring into the ownership of the disputed land when the question before her was whether

there was an owner-tenant cultivator relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent.

He further held that the 2nd Respondent has taken into consideration irrelevant facts in coming

to the conclusion that the Respondent was the tenant cultivator of Midelladola Aswedduma

belonged to Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama.

In Suneetha Rohini Dolawatha vs. Budhadhasa Gamage and another [S.c. Appeal No. 45/83;

S.C.M. 27.09.1985] (Reported as an annexure to Herath v. Peter (1989) 2 SrLl.R. 325) Ranasinghe

J. (as he was then) held:

flAny dispute in respect of a paddy-field arising between a landlord and a tenant, as

defined by the provisions of the said Act (Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979), and in

relation to which express provision is made therein will be regulated by the provisions so

contained in the said Act; and any such dispute would have to be determined in the

manner set out in the said Act. Such dispute cannot be brought before and sought to be

determined by a court of law.

Page 3 of6

This principle will apply only if the dispute, which arises in respect of a paddy-field, is a

dispute between a person, who is a landlord within the meaning of the said law, and a

person, who is a tenant-cultivator within the meaning- of the self-same Act. The two

_ parties to the dispute should each bear the character which the Act requires that each

should in fact and in law bear and possess, in order to enable one to enforce the rights

the Act gives him against the other, ~nd to subject the other to perform the obligations

which the Act compels him to perform. If one or the other does not in fact and in law

possess the character each is so required to have and possess, then the provisions of this

law cannot be availed of by one and be imposed against the other./I

Therefore, the jurisdiction of the 2nd Respondent depended on the Appellant establishing that

Midelladola Aswedduma belonged to Rajamaha Viharaya and the Respondent was the tenant

cultivator. However, as the learned High Court Juage,pointed out, the question of ownership is

not a matter that can be decided by the 2nd Respondent.

In any event, the 2nd Respondent took the view that Midelladola Aswedduma belonged to

Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama based on document marked ol.1 which is titled "Final report

on the village of Pahalakolawinna by the Land Settlement Department". It does not have the

same effect as a "Settlement Order" made under section 5(5) of the Land Settlement Ordinance.

Hence the 2nd Respondent fell into error in concluding that Midelladola Aswedduma belonged to

Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama.

The 2nd Respondent relied on document marked ol.2 to conclude that Uraneris was the tenant

cultivator of Midelladola Aswedduma. This is document at the most shows that one Uraneris had

signed as tenant cultivator of the land called "Madakalla" belonging to the Rajamaha Viharaya,

Kolawenigama. However, the land in dispute was called Midelladola Aswedduma. The 2nd

Respondent took into consideration irrelevant facts in concluding that the Respondent was a

tenant cultivator of the Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama in relation to Midelladola

Aswedduma.

The qespondent led the evidence'of;1 der~ ot ~hc Land 3ettlr:ment Department to establish that

the land in dispute did nat belong to Rajarr.oha ViharaYd, Kolawenigama. The 2nd Respondent

disregarded this evidence on the basis thcthe was only a clerk ut the said department. The

Pespondent also marked as eJ.1 an extract from the Register of Agricultural lands for 1992 which

showed that the Respondent was the owner cultivator of Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama.

Section 45(3} of the Act states that any entry in the said register shall be admissible in evidence

and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

In Suneetha Rohini Dolawatha vs. Budhadhasa Gamage and another (supra) Ranasinghe J. (as he

was then) explained the eVidentiary value of an entry in the agriculture register as follows:

liThe effect of an entry being declared to be "prima facie evidence" of the facts set out

therein is that it is "evidence which appears to be sufficient to establish the fact unless

rebutted or overcome by other evidence", qnd "is, not conclusive" - Sarker, Evidence, 10

ed. p. 27: "it is evidence which if not balanced or outweighed by other evidence will suffice

to establish a particular contention" - Halsbury 4th edt, Vol. 17, p 22, Sec. 28. A similar

view was expressed by Drieberg, J., in the case of Velupillai vs. Sidembram 31 NLR 99:

"Prima facie proof" in effect means nothing more than sufficient - proof - proof which

should be accepted if there is nothing established to the contrary; but it must be what

the law recognises as proof, that is to say, it must be something which a prudent man in

the circumstances of the particular case ought to act upon - 5.3, Evidence Ordinance".

Having quoted with approval the citations referred to above, 5amarakoon eJ.,

in Undugoda Jinawansa Thero vs. Yatawara Piyaratne Them. S.c. Appln. 46181,

S.C.M. 5.4.82 stated, in regard to the evidentiary value of an item of evidence which is

considered "prima facie evidence", thus:

"It is only a starting point and by no means an end to the matter. Its evidentiary value can

be lost by contrary evidence in rebuttal ... lf after contrary evidence has been led the scales

are evenly balanced or tilted in favour of the opposing evidence that which initially stood

as prima facie evidence is rebutted and is no longer of any value Evidence in rebuttal may

be either oral or documentary or both .... The Register is not the only evidence"."

Page 5 of6

The Appellant failed to rebut the evidentiary value created by the extract from the agriculture

register. The 2nd Respondent fell into error by failing to consider material evidence and

considering irrelevant material.

Jurisdictional facts are matters which must exist as a condition precedent, so to say before a

tribunal can properly take jurisdiction or cognizance of the particular matter or case. Non-

jurisdictional facts are those which do not affect the power of a tribunal to adjudicate concerning

the subject matter in a given case.

In R v. Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington Rent Tribunal [(1951) 2 K. B. 1 at 6] lord Goddard

c.J. held:

II If a certain state of facts has to exist before an inferior tribunal has jurisdiction, they can

inquire into the facts in order to decide whether or not they have jurisdiction but cannot

give themselves jurisdiction by a wrong d;ecision upon them; and this Court may, by

means of proceedings for certiorari, inquire into the correctness of the decision. II

For the reasons set out ear/ier, the 2nd Respondent has made a jurisdictional error of fact.

Accordingly, I am in agreement with the findings of the learned High Court Judge that the 2nd

Respondent exceeded her powers in concluding that Midelladola Aswedduma belonged to

Rajamaha Viharaya, Kolawenigama and that the Respondent was the tenant cultivator.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned High

Court Judge of Matara dated 17.11.2003.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
