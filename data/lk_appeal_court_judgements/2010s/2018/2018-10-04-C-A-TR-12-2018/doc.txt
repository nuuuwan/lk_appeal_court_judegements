Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking an order to transfer Case No.

BR/189/PC/17 pending in the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna to the Magistrate's

Court of Colombo or to any other Magistrate's Court that this Court deems fit.

The Petitioner is a director of Electro Automotive Private Limited, a private

company engaged in the importation and sale of motor vehicles. On 3rd

February 2016, the 1st Respondent had placed an order for an electric motor

vehicle with the said company. Having taken delivery and used the vehicle for

4 months, the Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent returned the vehicle as

the facilities to charge the said vehicle was not available in Jaffna. The

Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent had thereafter ordered a hybrid

vehicle. There had been an increase in the rate of the import taxes in May

2016 and the Petitioner had requested the 1st Respondent to bear such

increase in taxes, which the 1st Respondent had refused. The Petitioner, while

2

acknowledging that a total sum of Rs. 5 million had been paid by the 1st

Respondent, had proposed to the 1st Respondent that after deducting a sum of

Rs. 1,680,000 due to the Petitioner, he would refund a sum of Rs. 3,320,000

over a period of three yearsl, a proposal to which the 1st Respondent had not

agreed.

Acting on a complaint made by the 1st Respondent that the Petitioner had

cheated him, the 2nd Respondent, Officer-in-Charge of the Special Crime

Investigation Unit of Jaffna Police had filed a iB' Report in January 2017 in the

Magistrate's Court of Jaffna, bearing Case No. BR/189/PC/17 in relation to the

above transaction, alleging the commission of offences under Sections 386,

389 and 403 of the Penal Code. The Petitioner had been named as a suspect in

the further report filed in the said case in August 2017. The Petitioner had

been arrested in Colombo on 24th August 2017 and produced before the

learned Magistrate of Colombo, who remanded the Petitioner.

The Petitioner had been produced before the learned Magistrate of Jaffna on

6th September 2017. The Petitioner claims that he was "advised that unless he

made some part payment he will not be granted bail". He claims further that

he paid a sum of Rs. 500,000 to the 1st Respondent on the insistence of the

learned Magistrate, but that bail had been refused due to the objections raised

by the prosecution. The Petitioner claims further that the learned Magistrate

"directed him (to) pay the purported balance sum of Rs. 4,500,000 to enable

bail to be considered".

1 This is borne out by the draft agreement annexed to the petition, marked 'X4', which the Petitioner

claims he sent to the 1st Respondent.

3

The Petitioner had paid a further sum of Rs. 500,000 to the 1st Respondent

when the case was mentioned on 20th September 2017. Although the

Petitioner had been remanded for a further two weeks, he had been enlarged

on bail the next day, upon an application made by way of a motion, on

condition that he reports to the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna on the last

Monday of every month. The Petitioner had appeared in the Jaffna

Magistrate's Court on three occasions thereafter and paid a total sum of Rs.

255,000 to the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner states that as the company was

undergoing a financial crisis and was not in a position to pay any further sums

of monies, the Petitioner, being apprehensive of being arrested, has not

attended the Jaffna Magistrate's Court since 8th November 2017.

It is in the above factual background that the Petitioner has filed this

application claiming that the learned Magistrate has erred in law by acting as a

recovery court and that in any event, the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna has no

jurisdiction as the transaction took place in Colombo. In these circumstances,

the Petitioner states that he apprehends that he will not receive a fair and

impartial trial in the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna and that it would be

expedient for the case to be transferred to the Magistrate's Court of Colombo

or any other Magistrate's Court.

The statutory provisions with regard to the power of this Court to transfer a

case are found in Section 46(1) of the Judicature Act, which is re-produced

below:

"(1) Whenever it appears to the Court of Appeal-

4

a) that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in any particular court

or place; or

b) that some questions of law of unusual difficulties are likely to

arise; or

c) that a view of the place in or near which any offence is alleged to

have been committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry

into or trial of the same; or

d) that it is so expedient on any other ground,

the court may order upon such terms as to the payment of costs or

otherwise as the said court thinks fit, for the transfer of any action,

prosecution, proceeding or matter pending before any court to any other

court and accordingly in every such case, the court to which any such

action, prosecution, proceeding or matter is so transferred shall,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this or any other law, take

cognizance of and have the power and jurisdiction to hear, try and

determine such action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, as fully and

effectually to all intents and purposes as if such court had an original

power and jurisdiction."

The case filed in the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna is still at the 'B' Report stage.

The plaint has not been filed and therefore, the question of there being a trial

does not arise at the moment. The Petitioner has not placed any material

before this Court to demonstrate that he would not receive a fair and impartial

5

trial, if and when the plaint is filed and the trial starts. To that extent, this

application is not only misconceived in law but is also premature.

The basis for the Petitioners application for transfer falls under paragraphs (a)

and (d) of Section 46(1). The Petitioner has not directly alleged bias on the part

of the learned Magistrate. However, it appears that the Petitioner is claiming

that the learned Magistrate is biased in favour of the prosecution and for that

reason, he fears that he would not receive a fair and impartial trial.

The issue of bias was considered by this Court in Abdul Hasheeb vs Mendis

Perera and others2, where Justice G.P.S.De Silva (as he then was), having

discussed several English cases, held as follows:

IIln the subsequent authorities cited before us, two tests for disqualifying

bias have been formulated:-

(a) The test of real likelihood of bias; and

(b) The test of reasonable suspicion of bias.

Having cited the judgment of Lord Denning in Metropolitan Properties Co

(F.G.C) Limited vs Lannon3, Justice G.P.S.De Silva has proceeded to state as

follows:

lilt would appear that Lord Denning was inclined to adopt the 'real

likelihood' test but said that it was satisfied if there were circumstances

"from which a reasonable man would think it likely or probable that the

2 19911 SLR 243 at 257.

3 1968 - 3 All ER 304. 6

justice or the chairman, as the case may be, would, or did, favour one side

unfairly at the expense of the other". Lord Denning emphasized that "the

court looks at the impression which would be given to other people".

"The reason" he said "is plain enough, Justice must be rooted in

confidence; and confidence is destroyed when right minded people go

away thinking; the Judge was biased."

While the test of real likelihood of bias requires a substantially higher degree

of proof, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner urged this Court to

apply the less stringent of the two tests and argued that the Petitioner has

successfully established reasonable suspicion of bias on the part of the learned

Magistrate.

With regard to what should be established under this test, this Court has held

as follows4:

"even on the application of the test of reasonable suspicion, it must be

shown that the suspicion is based on reasonable grounds -- grounds

which would appeal to the reasonable, right thinking man. It can never be

based on conjecture or on flimsy, insubstantial grounds. Adopting the

words of Lord Denning in Lannon's case, Mr. Pullenayagam submitted that

"bias" in this context would mean, "a tendency to favour one side unfairly

at the expense of the other" -- a submission with which I agree."

This Court has carefully examined the material submitted by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner's argument that the Magistrate was acting as a recovery court

4 Abdul Hasheeb vs Perera (supra) at page 257. 7

and that he was forced to pay a sum of Rs. 500,000 cannot be believed when

one considers the fact that the Petitioner was ready with the said sum of Rs.

500,000 when he was produced before the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna on the

very first date. This demonstrates an intention on his part to voluntarily make

good, part of the money he had taken from the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner's position that the learned Magistrate insisted that he pay a sum of

Rs. 500,000 is contradicted by the Attorney-at-Law who appeared for the

Petitioner on 6th September 2017, who has stated in the letter marked 'X7's

that, 'my client admitted the liability out of fear that he would not be enlarged

on bail if he contest the case and expressed his willingness to pay a sum of Rs.

500,000.'

This admission by the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner confirms that it was

the Petitioner who volunteered to pay a sum of Rs. 500,000 and that the said

sum of money was not paid on the insistence of the learned Magistrate. The

Petitioner's claim that he was 'advised that unless he made some payment he

will not be granted bail' certainly did not come from the learned Magistrate. In

any event, this 'advise' was not correct as the learned Magistrate refused bail

on the objections of the prosecution, inspite of Rs. 500,000 being paid on 6th

September 2017.

In these circumstances, can it be said that a reasonable right thinking man

would think the learned Magistrate has favoured the prosecution at the

expense of the Petitioner or that the Petitioner would not receive a fair and

impartial trial? This Court does not think so. The accusation made against the

5 'X7' is a letter sent by the Attorney-at-Law who appeared for the Petitioner in the Magistrate's

Court of Jaffna on 6th and 20th September 2017.

8

learned Magistrate, with a view to demonstrating bias on his part, is therefore

unfounded. Thus, even if the less stringent of the test is applied, the Petitioner

has failed to establish a reasonable suspicion of bias on the part of the learned

Magistrate. In these circumstances, this Court rejects the argument of the

Petitioner that he would not receive a fair and impartial trial, before the

Magistrate's Court of Jaffna.

Before proceeding to consider the next ground urged by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner, this Court would like to refer to the

Order of this Court in Marcus vs Attorney General6 The complaint in that case

was that the learned High Court Judge, in the course of the proceedings had

remarked that, 'in this case, there is hardly anything to be inquired into'. It had

been the position of the petitioner in that case that this remark, 'deeply

disturbed him and left him the impression that the learned High Court Judge

had already taken a particular view of the case adverse to him and that he

would not get a fair hearing.,7 On the basis that the learned High Court Judge is

biased against the petitioner, a transfer had been sought under Section

46(1)(a) of the Judicature Act.

This Court, having referred to the two tests laid down in Abdul Hasheeb's case,

held as follows:

"To allege bias against a judicial officer is a serious matter and this Court

would not lightly entertain such an allegation. There is no material

whatever to suggest that the High Court Judge 'had already taken a

particular view of this case adverse to the petitioner' as alleged in the

6 Sri Skantha Law Reports Volume 2 Page 13l.

7 Ibid., page 132. 9

petition. In our view, the words complained of are innocuous and cannot

possibly form the basis of an allegation of bias."

In this regard, the following passage from the judgment in Abdul Hasheeb's

case would also be relevant:

flit seems to me that the facts set out in the petition are too remote and

too tenuous in character to found an allegation of bias on the part of a

judicial officer, who it must be remembered, is one with a trained legal

mind."

This Court is in full agreement with the position taken by this Court in the said

cases.

This Court would now consider if it is 'expedient' to transfer this case on any

other ground8. What is expedient has been considered in Subramanium vs

Subramanium9, where this Court has held as follows:

flA party to an action who seeks a transfer of a pending action from the

court in which it is pending to another court must adduce sufficient

grounds to satisfy us that it is expedient to make order for its transfer.

'Expedient' in this context, in my view, means fit or proper. A transfer

would not be ordered on light grounds."l0

..

This Court in Abdul Hasheeb's case agreed with the submission of the Counsel

for the Respondent that the expression "expedient" in the context means,

advisable in the interests of justice. In the circumstances of this case, is it fit

and proper or is it advisable in the interests of justice to transfer this case? This

Court does not think so. The Petitioner has not adduced any material to

demonstrate that the interests of justice would not be served by proceeding

with the case in the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna or that it would be fit or

proper to transfer the case. Therefore, this Court does not see any basis to

transfer this case on the ground of expediency.

In all the circumstances of this case, this Court sees no legal basis to issue

notices on the Respondents or order the transfer of Magistrate's Court of

Jaffna Case No.BR/189/PC/17. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
