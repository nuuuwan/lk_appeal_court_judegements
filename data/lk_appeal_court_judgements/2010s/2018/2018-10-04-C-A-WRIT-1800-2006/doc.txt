Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this application was mentioned before this Court on 11th July 2018, on a

motion filed by both parties, the learned Counsel appearing for the parties

informed Court that they have already tendered written submissions and

moved that this Court deliver judgment on the said written submissions. The

learned Counsel for all parties also agreed that the judgment of this Court in

this application would be binding on the parties in Writ Application Nos.

156/2001, 165/2001, 170/2001 and 171/2001.

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st - 13th Respondents to appoint the

Petitioners and the 14th - 43rd Respondents to Class III of the Sri Lanka

Educational Administrative Service with effect from 18th March 1995;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st - 13th Respondents from filling the

cadre of Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service from

candidates who sat for the Limited Competitive examination held on 11th

February 2006, unless the Petitioners and the 14th - 43rd Respondents are

also given appointments in Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational

Administrative Service.

The facts which are relevant to a consideration of the above relief are as

follows.

10

The 1st, 3rd and 5th Petitioners belonged to the Sri Lanka Principals Service while

the 2nd and 4th Petitioners belonged to the Sri Lanka Teacher Service. By a

notification published in Gazette No. 823 dated 10th June 1994 annexed to the

petition marked 'P3', applications were called for the Limited Competitive

Examination to select persons for appointment to Class III of the Sri Lanka

Educational Administrative Service.

Paragraph 16 of the Notice marked 'P3' sets out the basis of selection, as

follows:

II<!~~ ~ - (q) ~ ~ ~e5) <!mJc~ ~, ~ !)enX5><!d ~ @Q)(3)oS @~@ ~m) q~~~@ q~ ~ac9 oOme) e<3<I oOmerlr> ~~@COCD

q<ldme~ ~ ~ 00) sc)es> ~@Q !)Sed 8Qfi)Qd ~ @tctm.

Thus, in terms of paragraph 16, selection was on the basis of merit,

determined in accordance with the results of the limited competitive

examination, and with merit lists being prepared for each ethnic group, by

applying the National Ethnic Ratio.

A large number of candidates including the Petitioners and the 14th -43rd

Respondents had submitted their applications and sat for the said competitive

examination held on 18th March 1995. The Petitioners state that appointments

were made to Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service with

effect from 4th January 1999 from those who sat for the said examination. The

list of the appointees has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P6'. Three

unsuccessful candidates, who had sat for the said examination including the 4th

11

Petitioner in this application, filed Fundamental Rights Application Nos. 129/99

- 131/99 in the Supreme Court challenging the legality of the selection scheme

and the basis on which the said selections were made.

The Supreme Court, by its judgment delivered in SC (FR) 131/99 on 29th

October 1999, annexed to the petition marked Ip7', had determined that the

recruitment had been made on the basis of language in which the candidates

sat for the examination and for that reason, the recruitment was not in

accordance with the scheme set out in Ip3'. The Supreme Court had therefore

proceeded to quash the appointments made by lPG' and had further directed

that selections be made on the basis of paragraph 16 of Ip3'.

The 1st - 13th Respondents had accordingly submitted to the Supreme Court

the revised list of appointees prepared under each ethnic group and setting

out the marks obtained by each appointee. This list has been annexed to the

petition marked IPS'. The Petitioners state that pursuant to 'PS' being filed,

proceedings in SC (FR) 129/99 and 130/99 were closed and taken off the list on

29th of August 2000, as borne out by the journal entry in SC (FR) 130/99

annexed to the petition, marked 'pg'. At the time 'PS' was tendered to the

Supreme Court, the Petitioners had no issues with its contents. The persons

whose names appeared in 'PS' had accordingly been appointed to Class III of

the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service. Thus, appointments to Class

III of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service based on the results of

the limited competitive examination held on 18th March 1995 and the National

Ethnic Ratio have been conclusively dealt with by the Supreme Court in SC (FR)

131/99 and the matter ought to have ended there.

12

Several other persons who had sat for the examination held in 1995 but had

not received their appointment to Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational

Administrative Service had filed Writ Application Nos. 156/2001, 165/2001,

170/2001 and 171/2001 claiming that the application of the National Ethnic

Ratio should ensure the appointment of 263 Sinhalese candidates.

The Petitioners, who are Sinhalese candidates, claim that they found out in

2003 that the revised list of appointees marked 'PS' contained those who

obtained lesser marks than the Petitioners at the exam held in 1995. These

appointees belonged to other ethnic groups and therefore had been given

appointments on the basis of their ethnicity, in terms of paragraph 16 of 'p3',

Alleging that such a course of action is discriminatory, the Petitioners in this

application and several others had filed Fundamental Rights Application No.

451/2003 in the Supreme Court challenging the appointments of those who

had less marks than the Petitioners. By a judgment delivered on 29th

November 2004, the Supreme Court dismissed the said application, having

held as follows:

"Accordingly, it was directed! that the appointments should be made in

terms of paragraph 16 of P32 which specifies the National Ethnic Ratio as

the basis of selection. In compliance with that judgment, the

appointments that had been already given were revoked by letter dated

13.03.2000 and new letters had been issued dated 29.03.2000 in favour

of 1ih - 83rd respondents. It is not disputed that the letters sent on

29.03.2000 are based on the National Ethnic Ratio. Learned Counsel for

1 Directed by the Supreme Court in SC(FR)131/99.

2 The document referred to as 'P3' in the judgment in SC (FR) 451/2003 is identical to the document marked as 'P3' in this application.

13

the petitioners submits that there is no basis to make appointments on

the basis of National Ethnic Ratio and that the petitioners have been

adversely affected by a measure taken to give benefit to persons of ethnic

minorities. We are of the view that it is not open to this court at this

stage to examine the validity of the scheme of recruitment in P3, which

was published in 1994 and on the basis of which the petitioners applied

and sat the examination. Furthermore, the final appointments have been

made strictly in compliance with the judgment given by this court."

(emphasis added)

The Respondents had conducted a further limited competitive examination on

11th February 2006 to recruit persons to Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational

Administrative Service. The Petitioners who admittedly had not sat for this

limited competitive examination, filed this application in December 2006 when

the authorities took steps to conduct interviews for those who had passed the

aforementioned limited competitive examination held in February 2006, with

the Petitioners arguing that the vacancies in Class III should be given to them

as opposed to those who have passed the examination conducted in February

2006.

While the precise complaint of the Petitioners is not evident from the petition,

it appears to this Court that the Petitioners complaint is that the Education

Service Committee of the Public Service Commission has failed to follow the

National Ethnic Ratios declared by the Department of Census and Statistics,

annexed to the petition marked ip12' or the National Ethnic Ratios set out in

Public Administration Circular No. 15 / 1990 annexed to the petition marked

ip13', when it made the list of appointees iPS'. The Petitioners also claim that

14

had all the vacancies that existed been filled, more Sinhalese candidates could

have been appointed and that since the Petitioners had sufficient marks, the

Petitioners ought to have been given appointments to Class III of the Sri Lanka

Educational Administrative Service, along with the other appointees in IPS'. On

this basis, the Petitioners claim that they have a legitimate expectation of

being appointed to Class III of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service

in terms of the Notification Ip3' and the judgment of the Supreme Court,

ma rked Ip7'.

At the outset, this Court must note that the Petitioners are guilty of undue

delay, which has not been explained by the Petitioners. The application of the

National Ethnic Ratio was evident in 'PS'. If the Petitioners were unhappy with

its application, they ought to have complained at the time 'PS' was tendered to

the Supreme Court, which they have failed to do. The number of vacancies

available in Class III and the number of vacancies available for Sinhalese would

have been known to the Petitioners at the time SC (FR) Application No. 131/99

was filed. Even if one accepts the date given by the Petitioners - August 2003 -

as being the time at which they came to know of their marks and the number

of vacancies3, the Petitioners do not appear to have taken any steps at that

time to seek appointment for the vacancies that the Petitioners claim exists

nor has this argument been taken up in SC (FR) 451/2003. Thus, there has been

a long delay in filing this application and the said delay, as set out earlier, has

not been explained by the Petitioners. It has been held in a long series of cases

decided by this Court4 that this Court is entitled to refuse to exercise the Writ

3 The Petitioner in CA Writ Application No. 171/2001 has stated that the number of Sinhala officers to be recruited should be 263. 4See the judgment of Justice Marsoof, PICA (as he then was) in Dahanayake and others vs Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation Limited and others 2005 (1) Sri LR 67.

15

jurisdiction of this Court where there is delay and where such delay has not

been explained to the satisfaction of Court or not explained at all. Thus, on this

ground alone, this application is liable to be dismissed.

However, given the fact that there has been a series of cases filed by the

Petitioners and others who were not successful at the examination held in

1995, this Court has decided to examine the alleged grievances of the

Petitioners in this case and the connected cases, with a view of putting to rest

any doubts that the Petitioners may have of their right to receive an

appointment to Class III.

It is agreed between the parties that the first step in this entire process - the

Gazette notification marked 'P3' - very specifically states that recruitment shall

be on merit basis and that a separate merit list will be prepared in respect of

each ethnic group on the basis of the National Ethnic Ratio.

The revised list of appointees marked 'PS' prepared on the basis of the

National Ethnic Ratio was filed in SC (FR) 131/99 and has been accepted by the

Supreme Court. The issue as to whether the said list was not in accordance

with the ratios given in 'P12' or 'P13' or whether a proper application of the

National Ethnic Ratio should have resulted in a higher number of Sinhalese

candidates being appointed, are matters that should have been raised when

'PS' was tendered to the Supreme Court. None of these issues had been raised

at the time 'PS' was accepted by the Supreme Court or at the time SC (FR)

451/2003 was filed. In fact, the Supreme Court has held in SC (FR) 451/2003

that 'it is not disputed that the letters sent on 29.03.2000 are based on the

National Ethnic Ratio'. In these circumstances, this Court cannot at this stage,

16

examine if the correct National Ethnic Ratio had been applied in the

preparation of 'PS'.

The second complaint of the Petitioners is that sufficient vacancies were

available to grant more appointments to Sinhalese candidates. According to

the Respondents, the total number of vacancies available was 350. Thus, going

by the Petitioners own argument that by applying the ethnic ratio given in

(P13' that 75% of the appointments should be given to Sinhalese, the number

of Sinhalese candidates entitled to appointments will only be 262. According to

(PS', 241 Sinhalese candidates have been appointed. The Respondents have

explained that (21 vacancies were not filled as the next 34 candidates had

obtained equal marks at the said examination'. Paragraph 16 of (P3' provides

that where candidates have equal marks, a decision needs to be taken by the

Education Services Board of the Public Service Commission. This Court is of the

view that the decision taken by the Respondents to not offer appointments to

21 out of the 34 candidates who had obtained 171 marks5 is reasonable, as the

number of appointees cannot exceed the vacancies in the cadre. To have

selected 21 persons out of 34 equally qualified candidates would have been

arbitrary. This is a decision that a sensible person who had applied his mind to

the issue at hand could have arrived at. In these circumstances, this Court

cannot term the said decision as being irrational.

The Petitioners have sought to dispute the position of the Respondents, that

the number of vacancies was only 350, and have submitted several documents

with their counter affidavit purporting to support their position. The first such

5 Only the 2nd and 5th Petitioners have obtained 171 marks. The other Petitioners have only obtained 170 marks.

17

docu'ment is a letter dated 25th September 1998 marked 'P17,6, issued by the

Ministry of Education and Higher Education to the Education Service

Committee informing that 450 vacancies exists in the Sinhalese medium and

requesting that steps be taken to recruit 200 Sinhalese medium candidates.

This letter does not support the Petitioners as the request is to fill only 200

vacancies and the Petitioners do not come within the first 200 candidates. In

any event, 'P17' had formed part of the Respondents case in SC (FR) 131/99,

and ought to have been agitated in that case.

The next document relied on by the Petitioners is 'P19', which is a document

they claim was given to them by the 3rd Respondent after the filing of this

application. 'P19' does not bear a signature nor a date and its authenticity is

unknown. In any event, according to 'P19', the total number of vacancies in

Class III that can be filled on the basis of the limited competitive examination

was 333, which is less than what the Respondents state are the total number

of vacancies. Thus, 'P19' does not assist the Petitioners.

The final document relied by the Petitioners is a letter dated 4th September

2003, sent by the Public Service Commission, marked 'P20'. This letter confirms

that the appointments in 'PS' are based on the National Ethnic Ratio of 75%

Sinhalese. 'P20' does not contradict the position of the Respondents that the

number of vacancies was 350 and therefore does not assist the Petitioners.

Thus, the second complaint of the Petitioners that sufficient vacancies existed

in Class III for them to be appointed is devoid of any merit.

6 The Petitioners state that 'P17' was tendered to the Supreme Court by the Respondents in SC (FR) 131/99,

18

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioners have not

established that they have a legal right to be appointed to Class III of the Sri

Lanka Educational Administrative Service on the basis of the results obtained

by them at the examination held in 1995 and therefore have failed to satisfy

the legal basis for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus. Hence, the necessity to

consider the Writ of Prohibition prayed for does not arise. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.

As has been agreed upon by the learned Counsel President's Counsel and the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General, this Order must apply to CA (Writ)

Application Nos. 156/2001, 165/2001, 170/2001 and 171/2001. Accordingly,

CA (Writ) Application Nos. 156/2001, 165/2001, 170/2001 and 171/2001 must

also stand dismissed without costs.
