The Plaintiff instituted the above styled of action for the partition of

the land called Thanigahawate alias Ekagahawatte depicted in Plan No.

564/ dated 11/04/ 1994. According to the schedule to the amended plaint

dated 14/03/ 1997, as described in the Plan Number 564 marked X and

the extent of land sought to be partitioned is 1 Rood and 6.2 perches. The

plaintiff further stated that as per plan No.564 the lot A and B in extent of

Rood 1 and 6.2 Parches is the land to be partitioned and Lots C and D in

plan No. 564 are parts of the adjoining land depicted in plan No. 486

2

prepared by Peter G. Dias L.S. The said Plan No.486 was filed in

D.C.Kalutara Case No. 30208 and which is a superimposed Plan when

preparing the aforesaid Plan No.564 marked X. According to the amended

plaint the plaintiff stated that the original owners were namely,

Weerasuriya Jayawardena, Sembakuttipatabendige Poralanthin Silva was

entitled to 1/9 share by deed No.23795 dated 2/10/1945. Pinhena

Naidinage Raslin de Silva was entitled to 7/9th share by deed No. 1902

and Weerakonda Arachchige Bastian Silva was entitled to 1/9th share by

deed No. 8510 dated 3/3/1919 of the land sought to be partitioned. The

aforesaid Weerasuriaya Jayawardena Sembakutti Patabendige Porlanthin

Silva has gifted the 1/9 share to one K.B. Bastian Silva by deed No.1098

dated 09/01/1941 marked PI. After demise of the said Bastian, the

children of Bastian namely (Mariya de Silva, Peter de Silva , Richard de

Silva and Jane de Silva) had transferred same to one Hendrick Silva by

deed No. 42799 marked P2. The aforesaid Hendrick Silva died leaving

Sarojini Silva, the daughter, whose right had been transferred to one

Upasena Fernando by deed No.461 and the said Upasena Fernando has

transferred same to the plaintiff by deed No.377 dated 02/6/1991. The

Plaintiff further stated that Deed No.2447 dated 26/4/1979 marked as P6

is a deed given by Roslin de Silva to Agnes Amaraweera, the 1st defendant

and deals with the 7/9 share of the soil rights of the corpus sought to be

partitioned. The balanc1/9 share belonged to Bastian Silva who transferred

3

.'

same to one Martin H. Sebius by Deed No.37704 dated 22.07.1952 marked

as P9 who is the father of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.

Accordingly the shares were as follows.

The Plaintiff

The 1st Defendant

2nd and 3rd Defendant s

1/9 share

7/9 share

1/9 share

The Plaintiff further states that he and his predecessors have

prescribed to the land to be partitioned for over 10 years. The 1 st

defendant, claimed Lots A,C and D by long prescriptive possession, and

the 2nd Defendant claimed the plantation by right of inheritance in Lot A

with the 1st Defendant. According to the surveyor's report marked Xl, the

Plantation in lot A was claimed by the 1 st and the 2nd Defendants.

The learned District Jude held with the plaintiff holding that Lot A

and B are entitled to the corpus and excluded the Lot C and D depicted in

Plan marked X, accordingly 1/9 share was granted to the plaintiff, 7/9

share was granted to the 1st defendant and 1/9 share was granted to 2nd

and 3rd defendants.

The 1st defendant-Appellant preferred this appeal against the said

judgment. According to the issues and the pleadings the 1 st defendant-

respondent supposed to have possessed Lots A, B and C as one land in

lieu of 7/9 share although the Deed was written by 7/9 share in 1979, if

4

Roslin de Silva, the 1st Defendant's mother possessed the entire land she

could have written by deed for the entire land in 1979. This is the position

that the 1 st defendant could not explain in her statement of claim, this

shows that the 1 st Defendant was aware of the co-owners. In the evidence

of the 1 st Defendant, he has admitted the fact that Hendrike Silva and

Bastian Silva were entitled to 1/9 share of the land to be partitioned but

stated that they never possessed the same, but on perusal of the answer

marked P 10 filed in the District Court of Kalutara Case No.3043/L . The

1 st defendant and the 4th Defendant it very clearly shows that they were

aware of this fact and they have conceded the right of Hendrick Silva.

According to the above mentioned case, paragraph 6 clearly demonstrate

that the prescriptive claimed by contesting defendants of the rights of

Hendrick Silva was not true as per the paragraph 6 (v). The said Hendrick

Silva died without leaving children. The 2nd defendant- Rosalin Silva ( 4th

defendant in this case) inherited the said rights from Hendrick Silva. And

also when the answer was filed in 1987 by the said Rosalin Silva, the 4th

defendant in this case who is the mother of the 1 st Defendant, she did not

claim Hendrick Silva's right by prescriptive possession but by inheritance,

as an heir of Hendrick Silva because Hendrick Silva did not have children.

But after it was brought to the notice of Court that the said Hendirck Silva

died leaving his daughter Sarojini Silva claimed and claimed inherited

rights and prescriptive possession.

It is submitted by Counsel for the Plaintiff- Respondent that the 1st

defendant did not produced any deeds, though she pleaded Deeds in her

answer. In her evidence dated 8/5/1998, the 1st defendant had no answer

to give as to why she has not produced any deeds to prove her rights. In

cross examination about the fact that the 1 st defendant is entitled only for

7/9 share, she did not give any answer to the fact that the 1 st defendant is

entitled only for 7/9 share and she admitted that 2nd and 3rd defendants

are entitled to this land in question. And also when the 1 st defendant was

confronted with her answer marked P10 and P10 A, she had no answer to

give and she remained silent, and also in her cross examination the 1 st

defendant had admitted the plaintiffs pedigree and 7/9 shares given to

her.

The Learned District Judge had very clearly held in his judgment

that the 1st defendant had failed to prove prescriptive title to the entire land

and no clear evidence to show that the 1 st defendant has proved that the 1 st

defendant has possessed the entire land as she pleaded, but it is proved

that the 1 st defendant is entitled only 7/9 share as a co-owners to the lands

to be partitioned.

In the case of Korea Vs Iseris Appuhamy 1911 15 NLR page 65 held;

a) A co - owner's possession is in law the possession of other Co-owner

6

b) The every Co - Owner is presume to be possession in his capacity

as a co -owner.

c) That it is not possible for the co-owner to put an end to the

Possession as a co-owner by secret intention in his mind.

c) That nothing short of ouster or some equalant was could bring

about that result.

Even in the case of Ponnambalam Vs. Vithalingam and another

Ranasinghe,J. emphasized the termination of the common ownership

without express consent of all co-owners could take place where one or

more party is either or complete stranger or even one who is in the

pedigree claimed that they have prescribe to either entirety or specific

portion of a common land such a termination could take place only on the

basic of unbroken and uninterrupted at adverse position by such claimant

or at least period of 10 years the within the empersized mined.

The case of Sirajudeen and others Vs. Abbas (1994) 2 Sri L.R.365 it was

held that "where a party invokes the Provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse

claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and

fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights.

7 t

The 1 st defendant had admitted the titled and the co-ownership to

the land and therefore he has no rights to what so ever to challenged it.

And also the 1 st defendant-appellant had not produced any independent

material or witnesses or in her buttress and in her amended statement of

claimed dated 10/7/1997 she has admitted paragraphs 2,3, and 4 of

amended dated 14/3/ 1997.

In addition to that at the cross examination at the trial she has

-admitted the title set out in the paint as well as co-ownership of the subject

matter.
