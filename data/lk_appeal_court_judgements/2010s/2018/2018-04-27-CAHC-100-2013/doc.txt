The 2nd Accused-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant)

in the instant case was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha on 28.01.2004

along with the 1 S\ 3rd and 4th Accused for allegedly committing 9 offences. The

1 st and 4th Accused were acquitted from all charges and the 3rd Accused died

during the pendency of the trial. The Appellant was found guilty of the 2nd and

3rd charges and convicted and sentenced to death. The said charges are as

follows;

3

Count 2:

Committing the murder of W. Kulasiri Wijerathna by the 2nd Accused -

Appellant with others unknown to the Prosecution on or about 26.11.1994 and , offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code read together with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

Count 3:

Committing the murder of Kolambage Irin by the 2nd Accused - Appellant with

others unknown to the Prosecution on or about 26.11.1994 and offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code read together with Section 32

of the Penal Code.

The prosecution led the evidence of number of witnesses but the only eye

witness to the incident was one Nadeesha Hysinth Wijerathna (PW2) who was

the daughter of the deceased Kolambage Irin.

The case in brief for the prosecution was that on or about 26.11.1994 both W.

Kulasiri Wijerathna, Kolambage Irin and PW2 were at the said Irin's house

when, at around 4.00am there had been a knock on the door asking that the door

be opened. According to the narrative of the prosecution the Appellant had

come into the house and taken Kulasiri Wijerathna and Kolambage Irin out of

the house at gun point and thereafter got them to kneel down at which point

PW2 had gone back into the house after which she heard gun shots. When she

went back she had found both Kulasiri Wijerathna and Kolambage Irin lying

dead on the ground.

4

The Accused in this case were suspected of having committed the

aforementioned murders as a result of a statement made by the 3 rd Accused to

PWI, who was the mother of the said Kulasiri Wijerathna. On the date of the

incident the 3rd Accused who was the wife of Kulasiri Wijerathna had heard the

gun shots and remarked 'did you hear gun shots? I wonder if my brothers are

here.'

During that period Kulasiri Wijerathna was having an affair with Kolambage

Irin. The 1 st, 2nd and 4th Accused are brothers of the 3rd Accused. The Appellant

opted to make a dock statement by which he stated 'I don't know anything, I

have never even held a gun before.'

Although the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant had raised a number

of grounds of Appeal, I will focus on the reliability of PW2' s evidence, in

particular the dock identification, which formed the basis for the conviction of

the Appellant. PW2 identified the Appellant from the Dock at the non-summary

injury as the person who entered and thereafter committed the aforementioned

murders.

The learned President's Counsel for the Appellant submits that PW2 was only 7

years old at the time of the incident and that the Dock Identification was made

by her at the stage of the non-summary injury which was around 5 years since

the date of the incident and that it is unsafe to rely on the same.

As per PW15 (the investigating Police Officer) the identification parade was not

held to identify the Appellant as the sole eye witness to the incident, PW2, had

identified the 1 st and 2nd Accused by name.

It was revealed in evidence that the 1 st Accused was stationed at the Maduruoya

Army Camp during the time of the incident and as such the 1 st Accused was

acquitted.

PW15 also states that the first statement by PW2 to the Police indicated that she

could not identify the assailants if she saw them again. When cross-examined

PW2 states that she identified the Appellant as the assailant. When asked

whether she stated to the Police soon after the incident that she _ could not

identify the assailants if she saw them again, she says that she can't remember.

When asked whether if it is correct to say that she made such a statement to the

Police she answers in the negative and says that she can identify the assailant/s

(vide page 92 of the appeal brief). This contradiction was marked and proved as

2V1 by the defence.

This is a material contradiction that effects the roots of this case. The learned

Trial Judge in evaluating this contradiction had presumed that the reason for

PW2 to state to the Police that she could not identify the assailant/s was that she

may have been coached by her elders to not reveal the identity of the assailant/s

for her own safety. However, this Court is of the view that the presumption

arrived at by the learned Trial Judge is not based on any propositions that were

elucidated at trial but merely one possible reason, out of many, for this

contradiction which is not based on any legal principles.

It was held in the case of Munirathne and others v. The State 2001 (2) SLR 382

that;

"Jurists on evidence have expressed the view that it is undesirable and

unsafe for the Court to rely upon the identification of an accused in Court

for the first time or dock identification, the reason being that a witness

may think to himself that the Police must have got hold of the right

person and it is, so easy for a witness to point to the accused in a dock."

6

Further, it was revealed during the cross-examination of PW2, who had never

seen the Appellant prior to the incident, identified the Appellant at two

instances (vide page 89 and 93 of the appeal brief). She specifically mentions

that there was an 'identification parade'. She states that she was asked to

identify the Appellant once whilst inside a room and thereafter in open Court.

She also testifies that there were others in this room. She categorially states that

she identified the Appellant twice.

In the absence of an identification parade as confirmed by the prosecution it is

reasonable to question how and why PW2, the sole eye witness to the

aforementioned murders, was exposed to the identity of the Appellant before

she identified him in open Court.

It is evident that the entire case for the prosecution hinges on a dock

identification of the Appellant and when considering the above circumstances in

its totality it gives rise to a reasonable doubt on which the conviction and

sentence of the Appellant cannot stand.

Therefore, for the reasons more fully discussed above this appeal is allowed

and we set aside the conviction and sentence of the learned Trial Judge and

acquit the Accused-Appellant.

Appeal Allowed.
