SATHYA HETTIGE pc. J. PICA

The petitioner in this application is the General Secretary of the Eksath

Janatha Nidahas Sandanaya ,a recognized political party established under

and in terms of Parliamentary Elections Act no. 1 of 1981. The same party

is called and known as ItUnited People's Freedom Alliance" (UPFA) in English.

At the outset of the hearing of this application all parties agreed that the

issue involved in this application and all other connected CA applications

above referred to is the same and similar and all parties agreed that the

judgment in this application is applicable and binding on all parties in the

connected applications as well.

The petitioner is seeking ,inter alia, a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision of the 2nd respondent rejecting the nomination paper of ItUnited

People's Freedom Alliance" (UPFA) in respect of Akmeemana Pradeshiya

Sabha for the Local Authority Election that was scheduled for 17/03/2011

A copy of the letter dated 28/01/2011 is annexed to the petition marked

P 5.

A writ of Mandamus is also sought by the petitioner directing the 1st, 2nd

and or the 3rd respondents to forthwith accept the nomination paper of the

United People's Freedom Alliance for the Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha for

Local Authority Election.

The petitioner also sought an Interim order to stay the operation of the

purported decision of the 2nd respondent contained in P5 to reject the

3

nomination paper of the United People's Freedom Alliance for Akmeemana

Pradeshiya Sabha for Local Authority Election scheduled for 17/03/2011.

The petitioner also an Interim Order to restrain the 1st, 2nd and or the 3rd

respondents and or their servants and agents

to be conducted the Local Authority Election

Sabha for Local Authority Election scheduled

from conducting or causing

for Akmeemana Pradeshiya

for 17/03/2011 until final

determination of this application. This court accordingly , having heard all

the parties, issued notice and Interim Order on 18/02/2011 on the 1st, 2nd

and 3rd respondents.

The petitioner in this application as the General Secretary of the United

People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) duly appointed the 2nd petitioner as the

Authorized Agent of the said party for the electoral area of Akmeemnana

Pradeshiya Sabha for Local Authorities Election that was scheduled for

17/03/2011.

The petitioner states that this application is in relation to an unlawful and

arbitrary rejection of nomination paper of the UPFA for Akmeemana

Pradeshiya Sabha communicated to the petitioner by the letter dated

28/01/2011 by the 2nd respondent marked P5.

It is stated in the petition that the 2nd petitioner as the duly Authorized

Agent on 27.01.2011, consequent to the notice published by the 1st

respondent under section 26 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as

amended submitted the Nomination paper within the time frame stipulated

therein to the 3rd respondent who was the District Returning officer for

Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha containing the names of Nineteen ( 19)

candidates (5th to 23rd respondents) nominated by the UPFA for Akmeemana

Pradeshiya Sabha for the Local Authorities election scheduled for

17/03/2011. The petitioners state that the nomination paper was duly

complied with in accordance with the law and was complete without any

short comings.

4

Petitioners further state that after the "nomination period" ended at 12.00

noon on 27/01/2011 and no objection was raised by any of the contesting

rival parties during the period of one and half hours from 12.00 noon the 2nd

respondent made an announcement stating that the nomination paper

handed over by the UPFA was rejected owing to a purported defect in the

nomination paper.

By the letter dated 28/01/2011 marked P 5 the 2nd respondent formally

communicated to the 1st petitioner that the nomination paper of UPFA was

rejected by him under section 31(2) of the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance as amended and also intimated the following reason.

lilt is hereby informed that the nomination paper tendered on 27/01/2011 by the United People's Freedom Alliance which is a recognized political party, in respect of Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha for Local Authorities Election scheduled to be held on 17/03/2011 was rejected in terms of sub section 31 ((1) (d) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended by Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 2S of 1990 for failure to comply with the provisions of sub section 28 (4) of the said Act.

Reason: II The oath /affirmation as the case may be in the form prescribed in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, of one candidate not being signed by the Justice of the Peace/Commissioner for Oaths."

It is obviously clear that the rejection of the nomination paper had been

made under section 31(1) (d) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as

amended for the above reason.

It should be noted that the petitioners in this application have failed to

annex a certified copy the nomination paper to the petition. However, on

a direction by court learned DSG assisted court by producing the original of

the rejected nomination paper for perusal by court.

5

On a careful perusal of the rejected nomination paper the court observed

that one of the candidate's oath/affirmation in terms of Seventh Schedule to

the Constitution has not been signed by the Justice of the peace who

stamped his official frank thereon. It also appeared that all other candidates'

oath /affirmation had been signed by the Justice of the Peace and with

his official seal . The court observes that it may be due to a genuine lapse

on the part of the Justice of the peace to place his signature thereon.

However, Mr Wijesinghe PC contended strenuously that there is no legal

requirement in terms of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution that the

oath / affirmation of the candidate has to be made before the Justice of the

Peace and candidate's signature is sufficient in terms of the law.

At this stage it is necessary to examine the provisions contained in sections

28 (4) and section 31 (1) (d) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as

amended which reads as follows.

Section 28(4) liThe written consent of each candidate to be nominated by a recognized Political Party or Independent Group shall be endorsed on the nomination paper, an oath or affirmation, as the case may be, in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, taken and subscribed or made and subscribed, as the case may be, by every such candidate. "

Section 31 (1) (d) reads as follows:

1/ Where the consent of one or more of the candidates nominated has or have not been endorsed on the nomination paper or where the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of one or more candidates has or have not been annexed to the nomination paper"

6

On a careful reading of section 28(4) of the Local Authorities Election

Ordinance as amended there are two requirements to be satisfied.

a) That the written consent of each candidate to be nominated (by a

political party or Independent group) shall be endorsed on the

nomination paper; and

b) That there shall be annexed to the nomination paper, an oath or

affirmation, as the case may be, in the Form set out in the Seventh

Schedule to the Constitution, taken and subscribed or made and

subscribed, as the case may be, by every such candidate.

Learned President Counsel for petitioner contended that only requirement is

oath/affirmation in the form prescribed in the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution must be taken and subscribed! made and subscribed, as the

case may be by each candidate and all such oaths and affirmations were

signed and or subscribed by relevant candidate and were in the form

prescribed in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution .

Mr Wijesinghe PC further submitted that the rejection of the nomination

paper is based on the fact that one such oath/affirmation did not contain

the signature of the Justice of the Peace. However, the requirement that

such oath / / affirmation must be signed by a Justice of the Peace is not

stipulated in section 28 (4) or sec. 31(1) (d) of the Law. There is no reference

whatsoever in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution that oath/

affirmation must be taken / made and subscribed before any particular

person or body.

It was further submitted that in the absence of any such requirement the

returning officer who merely performs a ministerial function of examining

the nomination paper tendered to him has no power to go in to the

legality of an oath/ affirmation which has been duly signed annexed to the

nomination paper.

7

It is also pertinent to consider the provisions contained in section 28 (5) of

the same law which provides as follows:

Each nomination paper shall be signed by the Secretary of a Recognized

Political Party and in the case of an Independent Group by the candidate

whose name appear in the nomination paper of that group and is

designated therein as the Group leader of that group (such candidate is

hereafter referred to as the Group Leader) and shall be attested by a

Justice of the peace or by a Notary Public."

It was strongly argued by the learned President's Counsel for petitioner

that section 28 (5) specifically states that the nomination paper shall be

attested by a Justice of the Peace or a Notary Public. And if the Legislature

intended that the oath/affirmation by the candidate had be endorsed and

attested by a Justice of the Peace it should have been specifically stated in

the statute itself. The Constitution does not provide for such a requirement

since the specimen oath /affirmation is given in the Seventh Schedule

without such a legal requirement.

Mr Chrismal Warnasooriya appearing for the 44th respondent strongly

objected to any relief being given to the petitioner on the basis that the

section 28 (4) requires that the candidate's oath /affirmation has to be

taken and made before a Justice of the peace or a Notary Public. The leaned

Counsel relied on the Judgment of Justice Tilakawardane in CA application

no. 378/2002 ( unreported) decided on 26/03/2002 wherein her Ladyship

refused and dismissed the application on the basis that it is set out in the

Seventh Schedule to the Constitution stating that oath has to be taken and

subscribed before a person or body referred to in the Article 157 (a) (7) of

the Constitution.

Mr Warnasuriya also cited a judgment in the case of Sathasivam v.

Ratnayake & Others CA Writ 325/06 decided on 06/03/2006 in support of

his submission wherein the court observed that the requirement in section

28 (4) cannot in any manner be considered as less important than the

requirement in section 28 (5) ..... "But once the nomination period expires the

8

duty of the returning officer is to examine the nomination paper ... and

reject any nomination paper under section 31 (1) ... the returning officer's

function is a ministerial act and there is no decision or determination made

by him capable of being quashed by a Writ certiorari.."

However, I have carefully considered the submission of the learned counsel

for 44th respondent who relies on the judgment of Justice Tilakawardane

in the above case wherein the court took the view that oath and affirmation

has to be taken and subscribed before a person or body referred to in

Article 157 A(7) of the Constitution. With utmost respect to Her Ladyship, I

do not agree with the conclusion in that judgment on the basis that article

157 (A) (7) of the Constitution has no application to the present case before

us.

While appreciating the effort made by the counsel for 44th respondent to

support his contention, I do not agree with the submission of the learned

counsel on the basis that the provisions of Article 157 (A) (7) of Constitution

do not apply to the present case.

Article 157 (A) (7) of the Constitution reads as follows.

II Every officer or person who was or is required by Article 32 or Article 53

, Article 61 or Article 107 or Article 165 or Article 169 (12), to take and

subscribe or make and subscribe an oath or affirmation, every member of ,

or person, in the service, of a local authority, Development Council Pradishiya

Sabha Mandalaya, Gramodaya Mandalaya or public corporation and every

Attorney-at-law shall -

(a) If such officer or person is holding office on the date of coming into force of t his Article, make and subscribe, or take and subscribe, an oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule, before such person or body if any, as is referred to in that Article, within one month of the date on which this Article comes into force; (b) If such person or officer is appointed to such office after the coming into force of this Article, make and subscribe or take and subscribe,

9

an oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule, before such person or body, if any, as is referred to in that Article within one month of this appointment to such office".

On a careful reading of the above Article it appears that the Constitutional

requirement contained therein is not applicable to candidates who are not

members in such service. In this application the impugned nomination paper

contains names of the candidates who may become members if elected at

the local authorities election on a future date. Therefore I do not agree

with the submission of Mr. Warnasuriya on that issue and also I do not think

that this court should consider the judgment referred to in CA 378/02

decided on 26/03/2002 as applicable and that judgment is not relevant.

It should be also noted that one can argue that the functions performed by

the returning officer was ministerial in nature and that the returning officer

does not exercise any discretionary power as he merely performs a IIrubber

stamp duty". The returning officer has to examine carefully the nomination

paper before accepting or rejecting. he is also empowered to make any

corrections under section 28 (8) of the law if he is satisfied that there is

error or mistake due to inadvertence.

The decision of the 2nd respondent rejecting the nomination paper of the

petitioners in this application does not seem to be one that falls within any

one of the limbs namely section 31 (a), (b) ,(c) (d) and (e) stipulated in

section 310f the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended.

The learned Deputy Solicitor general submitted that in view of provisions

contained in section 31 (1) (d) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

as amended which provides

II Where the consent of one or more of the candidates nominated has or have not been endorsed on the nomination paper or where the oath or

affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of one or more candidates has or have not been annexed to the nomination paper"

Section 31 (1) (d) does not require the oath or affirmation to be taken and

subscribed but merely requires for the same to be annexed to the

nomination paper.

The issue to be determined by this court is as to whether the rejection

of the nomination paper by the Returning Officer , the 2nd respondent is

bad in law or whether the 2nd respondent has arbitrarily acted in excess of

his powers vested under section 31 of the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance as amended.

In view of the above provisions of law this court has to consider as to

whether the reason given by the 2nd respondent for rejection of the

nomination paper is in fact a ground for rejection of the entire nomination

paper under the above provisions in section 31 of the Local Authorities

Election Ordinance as amended. It seems to me that 2nd respondent' powers

of rejecting a nomination paper is limited to the grounds stipulated in

section 31 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended above

referred to.

The returning officer has no power to reject a nomination paper on any

other ground in terms of the law. The returning officer's powers are limited

to the grounds stipulated in section 31 of the Statute. He cannot extend

the power conferred on him beyond that limit.

As Sharvananda J ( as he then was) observed in

Sirisena and Others vs. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands 80

NLR 1 at 172) that

II It is of the utmost importance to uphold the right and indeed the duty of the courts to ensure that powers shall not be exercised unlawfully which have been conferred on a local authority,or the executive or indeed anyone

11

else, when the exercise of such powers affect the basic rights of an individual. The courts should be alert to see that such powers conferred by such statute are not exceeded or abused"

The basic principle that legality should prevail has been discussed in the

unreported judgment of Lord Green MR., in the case of

Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries vs Hulkin 1950 1 KBD at page 154

which reads as follows.

liThe power given to an authority under a statute is limited to the four corners of the powers given. It would entirely destroy the whole doctrine of ultra vires if it was possible for the donee of a statutory power to extend his power by creating an estoppel"

The returning officer , the 2nd respondent appears to have acted outside

the law exceeding his powers warranting the intervention of this court to

consider the petitioner's grievance. It appears that one single and arbitrary

action of the 2nd respondent has caused unnecessary harassment and greater

damage to the petitioner and also has deprived the electors of their

democratic rights of electing a candidate or candidates of their choice.

In the unreported case of Dr. A .. L.M.Hafrath Secretary General Sri Lanka

Muslim Congress V L.L.C Siriwardane Returning Officer C.A.Appl. 413/2002

Justice MS.Tilakawardane held that

II The returning ofticer1s decision to reject the nomination paper affected not

only the rights of all the candidates of the political party in guestion but also

the rights of the voters who exercise their franchise for that party and for

the particular candidate of that political party. II

12

Mr Wijesinghe PC also submitted that the provIsions contained in Article

157 (1) (7) of the Constitution apply only to members of the Local

Authorities and not to the candidates and the legal obligation for

candidates to annex the oath in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule

of the Constitution arises by virtue of the section 28 (4) of the Local

Authorities Elections Ordinance and not under Article 157 (A) (7) of the

Constitution. The provisions of section 28 (4) stipulating the requirement of

an oath by candidates for local Authorities election was introduced by the

amendment No 48 of 1983 to the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance

subsequent to the 6th amendment to the Constitution which brought in

Article 157 (A) (7). Therefore the Learned President's Counsel argues that

the Constitutional provisions in Article 157(A) (7) is inapplicable to candidates

contesting local authorities elections.

It seems to me that the decision of the returning officer, the 2nd

respondent for Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha would affect not only the

rights of the petitioners of Recognized political party in question but also the

rights of other candidates reflected in the same nomination paper and the

rights of voters who exercise their franchise. This court's judicial power of

review in determining prerogative writs has not been taken away by law in

applications of this nature when the rights of the subjects are affected as a

result of one single and arbitrary action of the public officers.

13

The learned Deputy Solicitor General had no objection to a Writ being

issued quashing the decision of the 2nd respondent rejecting the

nomination and issuing a Writ of Mandamus in accepting the nominations

of the petitioner.

As such I hold that there is no legal requirement for the oath /affirmation

of candidate to be taken /made before any person or body in respect of

local Authorities election.

I therefore conclude that the rejection of the nomination paper by the 2nd

respondent by the letter marked P 5 based on the absence of an

attestation by a Justice of the Peace is not a ground for rejection under

section 31 (1) (d) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended.

For the reasons set out above I am of the view that the application of

the petitioner should be allowed and relief sought should be granted.

Accordingly, a Writ of Certiorari is issued quashing the decision of the 2nd

respondent contained in PS rejecting the nomination paper as per

paragraph lid" of the prayer to the petition.

Court also issues a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd respondents

to accept the nomination paper submitted by the petitioner according to law

and take all other consequential steps in terms of the law as per sub

paragraph lie" of the prayer to the petition.

14

I order no costs.

The judgment in this application is applicable and binding on all parties in

the connected applications CA 78/2011, CA 110/2011 and CA 133/2011 as

well.
