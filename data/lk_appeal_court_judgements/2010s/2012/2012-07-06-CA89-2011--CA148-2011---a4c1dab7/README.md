SUPPORTED ON: 01/03/2011

Decided on 14th March 2011

SATHYAA HETTIGE PC. J, pICA

Counsel in all the applications above referred to the parties

agreed that since the issues to be determined by court involved

are similar and identical in all the applications 1 the parties will

4.

abide by the decision in this application in respect of all the

applications except CA application no. 176/2011.

However, Learned Deputy Solicitor General for respondents

submitted that facts in CA application No. CA 176 /2011 are in

dispute. As such I will determine the issue in CA application

176/2011 on the question as to whether the notice should be

issued separately.

The petitioner in this application is a recognized political party for

the purpose of local elections and the 2nd petitioner is the

General Secretary of the said Recognized Political party.

For the purpose of the local authorities election scheduled to be

held on 1ih March 2011 for the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha

the 1st petitioner nominated and authorized one Abdul Latif

Mohamed Ishak to be the "Authorized Agent" of the 1st

petitioner political party and duly communicated the said

authorization to the 2nd respondent who accepted same by the

letter dated 18/01/2011 marked P 1.

The petitioners state that on 26th January 2011 the Authorized

Agent went to the Trincomalee Elections office with another

candidate by the name of M.A.M Aswer of the 1st petitioner

recognized political party to deliver the nomination paper. It is

stated in the petition that A.L.M. Ishak, the authorized agent

was a diabetic patient and was exhausted and unwell on that day

having had to break rest and skip meals in the preceding 2 or 3

s.

days .It is also stated that the authorized agent , A.L.M. Ishak had

a knee problem due to an injury he had suffered a few years

ago and climbed the stairs with the assistance of Aswer when

they went to the hall for handing over the nomination papers.

Since the authorized Agent , Ishak was sick and feeling dizzy he

was asked by the officials of the election office to be seated a

few feet away from the Returning officer's table. The other

candidate Aswer who went with Authorized Agent thereafter

delivered the nomination paper to the returning officer.

On 2ih January 2011 when

went to the election office

the Authorized Agent and Aswer

they were informed that their

nomination paper had been rejected on the basis that their

nomination paper had not been delivered by the Authorized

Agent. The said letter of rejection of the nomination paper

addressed to the 2nd petitioner is annexed marked P 8.

The complaint of the petitioner is that the rejection of the

nomination paper is unreasonable and contrary to law and the

petitioner states that the 2nd respondent has acted unreasonably

and erred in law in rejecting the nomination paper when in fact

the Authorized Agent had been present and attended to the

handing over of the nomination paper.

6.

The petitioners are seeking inter alia, the following reliefs

a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 2nd

respondent rejecting the nomination paper contained in P 8

and

b) an Interim Relief restraining the respondents more

particularly the 1st respondent from holding the election for

Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha until final determination of this

application

The respondents strongly objected to this application on the

basis that rejection of the nomination paper by the 2nd

respondent is within the law since the petitioners have failed to

strictly comply with the provisions contained in section 28 (5) of

the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as amended.

It is conceded that the nomination period had commenced on 20th

January 2011 and had expired at 12.00 noon on 2ih January

2011 as per the document marked P 2.

A nomination paper in terms of section 28 (5) of the Local

Authorities Election Law is required to be delivered to the

returning officer by the General Secretary or authorized Agent of

the recognized political party or the Group Leader in case of an

Independent Group within the nomination period stipulated above.

7.

The provisions contained in section 28 (5) of the Local Authorities

Election Ordinance as amended reads as follows:

"Section 28(5) -Such nomination paper shall be

delivered to the returning officer within the nomination period by

the Secretary or the Authorized agent, in the case of a

recognized political party, or the group leader in the case of an

independent group. "

In this application One A.L.M Ishak has been appointed as the

Authorized Agent for the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha for the Local

Authorities election to be held on lih March 2011.

However, the nomination paper had been delivered to the

Returning officer by one Aswer who was one of the candidates in

the list of candidates of the 1 st petitioner party and the said

nomination paper had been rejected in terms of section 31 (1) (a)

of the said Act as the nomination paper was delivered by a

person other than the Authorized Agent.

The respondents contended that it is mandatory that the

nomination paper must be delivered by the Party Secretary or

his Authorized Agent within the nomination period and failure to

comply with that requirement will result in the said nomination

paper being rejected Under section 31 (1) (a) of the said law.

"

8.

Counsel for respondents strongly submitted that the argument of

the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Authorized Agent was

present does not satisfy the legal requirement contained in section

28 (5) of the law.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General cited several judgments

decided by this court and the Supreme Court in support of the

contention that the it is mandatory to comply with the provisions

of section 28 (5)

In the case of Ediriweera Returning Officer for Akuressa

Pradeshiya Sabha V Kapukotuwa General Secretary United

National Party 2003 1 SLR 228 it was held that when examined

the scheme of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as

amended, the requirement of section 28 (5) was mandatory and

calls for compliance.

In Writ application No. 320/2002 decided on 26/03/2002 the

Court of Appeal held that the impossibility of compliance and

performance under section 28 (5) of the Law had not been

proved and accordingly application of the petitioner was dismissed.

Even the Special Leave to Appeal application to the Supreme

Court was also refused by the Supreme Court.

9

In the Special Leave to Appeal application no. 78/ 2002 to the

Supreme Court against the CA application No. 320/2002 it was

further held that

" In the light of the facts and circumstances as then

known to the 1st respondent, there was a breach of

section 28 (5) and even assuming that impossibility was an

acceptable excuse, she had no option but to reject the

nomination paper. The correctness of her act cannot be

judged by reference to other fact and circumstances not

communicated to her due to lapses on the part of those

concerned. H

CA Writ application 378/2006 decided on 09-03-2006 was an

application pertaining to the rejection of the nomination paper, which was

delivered by a person other than the authorized agent where the

authorized agent had been present. It was held that,

"Hence the provisions in section 28(5) have to be construed as

mandatory. In the event of non-compliance, section 31(a) places

a firm sanction by mandating the rejection of the nomination

paper. Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim that the nomination

paper has to be accepted as there is substantial compliance. In

these circumstances, the decision of the 1st Respondent cannot be

construed as unreasonable.

Mr. Fernando DSG for the 1st and 2nd respondents and other counsel for

the respondents argued that in view of the case law decided by our

courts and the reasons set out above the petitioner is not entitled to

any relief sought in this application and other similar applications and the

notice should be refused in limine.

The learned counsel further argued that there is no public duty on the

part of the 1st and the 2nd respondents to accept a nomination paper

under these circumstances delivered by a person other than the Secretary

of the party in question or his Authorized Agent.

It seems to me that when considering the scheme of the diverse

provisions of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as amended the

primary purpose of the Law is to ensure and safeguard the election process

and I observe that the election law requirements should be strictly observed

by the parties contesting the election and the failure to comply with

statutory provisions is fatal to the petitioners' application.

Having carefully considered the legal provisions in the Local Authorities

Law and submissions of the parties and the facts and circumstances in this

application and other similar applications, I observe that the Returning

Officer has acted in good faith and within the legal provisions stipulated

in section 31 (1) of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as amended

/' . /

11

and I uphold the objections raised by the learned counsel for the

respondents.

And as such am of the view that the reliefs sought by the petitioners

cannot be granted in their favour and the application of the petitioners

should be dismissed.

Accordingly I refuse to issue notice and dismiss this application and

application Nos. CA 148/2011, CA 196/2011 . The Order in this application is

binding and applicable to the application Nos. CA 148/2011 and CA 196/2011

No costs.

PRESIDENT FO THE COURT OF APPEAL.

Upaly Abeyratne J,

I agree.
