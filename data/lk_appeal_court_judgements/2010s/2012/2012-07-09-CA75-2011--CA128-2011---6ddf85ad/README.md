SATHYA HETTIGE P.C J, (P/CA)

The petitioners in this application are the members of an Independent

group who tendered their nominations paper marked A to contest the

Local Authorities election that was scheduled to be held on 1ih March

2011 for the Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha

At the outset of hearing all counsel agreed that the issues involved in this

application and the connected applications Nos. CA 128/2011, CA 140/2011,

CA 141/2011, CA 146/2011, CA 153/2011, CA 161/2011, CA 165/2011, CA

177/2011 and CA 189/2011 are the same and similar and as such counsel

agreed that the all the cases can be consolidated and heard together and

the judgment in this application will be binding and applicable to all parties

in the connected applications as well.

The petitioners state that the 1st petitioner as the leader of the

Independent Group handed over the duly completed nomination paper with

the annexes, oath and copies of the birth certificates of the ten candidates

who were youth candidates. The petitioner states that 9 out of the 10

certificates were true photocopies certified by the Justice of the Peace.

After the expiry of the period for objections the 1st respondent announced

that the nomination paper of the petitioners' Independent group was

rejected on the basis that copies of the birth certificates certified by the

Registrar of Birth and attested by the Justice of the Peace with his

signature and seal.

4

The petitioners are seeking inter alia, the following reliefs

(a) a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st and 2nd

respondents rejecting the nomination paper of the petitioner marked

(A) for Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha.

(b) A writ of Mandamus on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents to accept

the nomination paper of the petitioners

Mr. Mendis PC at the hearing conceded the fact that only true copies

of the 9 youth candidates certified by the Justice of the Peace had

been annexed to the nomination paper and tendered to the 1st

respondent.

The impugned document marked A 3 is the letter that was issued by

the 2nd respondent informing the leader of the petitioner's

Independent group of the rejection. The reason for rejection is that

the petitioner's Independent group has not tendered the certified

copies of birth certificates of nine (9) youth candidates.

Learned President's Counsel contended that in terms of the

provisions contained in section 4 (1) (a) of the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995

the documents reproduced, by the use of electronic or mechanical

process are to be legally accepted and therefore the rejection of the

entire nomination paper is bad in law on the basis that the

photocopies certified by a Justice of the peace as true copies is

sufficient proof in proving the age of the youth candidate.

5

The learned Deputy Solicitor general and counsel for the other

respondents strongly objected to any relief being granted to the

petitioner on the basis that the requirement contained in section 28

(4) A of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 25 of 1990 it is mandatory for a youth candidate to furnish

either certified copy of the Birth Certificate or an Affidavit for the

purpose of establishing the date of the birth of the youth candidate.

The section 28 (4) (A) of the Law reads as follows.

1/ A certified copy of the Birth certificate of every youth candidate

whose name appears in the nomination paper Q! an affidavit signed

by such youth candidate, certifying his date of birth shall be

attached to such nomination paper"

It was strenuously argued by the learned counsel for respondents that

requirement of the certified copy of the birth certificate or the affidavit is

mandatory and must be strictly observed by the youth candidates.

It is also important to note that 1/ youth" has been defined clearly in the

provisions in section 89 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as

amended for the purpose of elections which this court has to consider as

relevant.

Section 89 of the law reads as follows:

II youth" means a person not less than eighteen years of age at first June

of the year in which the revision of the operative electoral register

commenced under Registration of Electors Act No. 44 of 1980 and not

more than thirty five years of age on the last day of the nomination

period specified under this Ordinance in respect of the election at which

he seeks to be a candidate."

6

For the purpose of above section a youth candidate contesting a local

authority election for the year 2011 should have reached the age of 18, as

at 1/06/2009.

On a careful reading of the above provisions in section 28 (4) A of the Law

it is imperative to strictly comply with the requirement of furnishing a

certified Copy of the birth certificate issued by the Registrar of Birth or an

affidavit and failure to observe the above requirement in proof of age of

the youth candidate as required by section 28 (4) (A) will result in the

nomination paper being rejected by the returning officer.

It is to be noted that the requirement of a 40% of the total number

candidates nominated should be youth candidates was brought in by the

Local Authorities Election Ordinance (amendment) Act no 25 of 1990.

Section 28(1) A of the Act reads as follows:

II Notwithstanding any provisions in this Act to the contrary, in each nomination paper submitted in respect of an election for the electoral areas of a local authority, not less than forty per centum of the total number of candidates nominated in each nomination paper shall consist of youth"

And as such the issue to be determined by this court is as to whether the

true copy of a birth certificate certified by a justice of the peace and

attached to the nomination paper by a youth candidate is sufficient to

satisfy the requirement in section 28 (4) (A) of the Law.

Mr. A.P Niles who appeared for the 3rd respondent in this application

submitted that the Local Authorities Election Ordinance as amended does

not define what constitutes a IICertified Copy" in relation to a birth

certificate. And therefore this court has to resort to the provisions

contained in Birth and Deaths Registration Act which provides for

registration of births in order to obtain a definition.

Section 56 (1) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act provides as

follows:

7

II Any person shall be entitled on making a written application to the

appropriate District Registrar or to the appropriate Additional District

Registrar or to the appropriate registrar and under such conditions and on

payment of such fees as may be prescribed to refer to any book or

document in the possession of such District Registrar, Additional District

Registrar or registrar, and kept under this Act or under any past

enactment, and to demand a certified copy of or a certified extract from,

any entry in such book or document. The Registrar - General or Assistant

Registrar General may, on payment of such fees as may be prescribed,

issue a certified copy or an extract from any registration entry. N

Therefore counsel submits that a certified copy of a birth certificate is

necessarily a copy that is certified by the custodian of the records

pertaining to the registration of births. As such it can be seen that mere

photo copies certified as true copies by a Justice of the Peace do not

constitute a certified copy of the birth certificate.

Learned DSG drew our attention to the provisions in section 63 of the

Evidence Ordinance which deals with secondary evidence. Under section 63

thereof secondary evidence means and includes certified copies under the

provisions contained therein. section 64 thereof states that documents must

be proved by primary evidence except in cases specified therein. Mr.

Fernando further submitted that under section 75 of the Evidence Ordinance

secondary evidence may be given inter alia, when the original is a

document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Ordinance or by any

other law in force in Ceylon to be given in evidence. Therefore it was

submitted that the Original Birth Registration Entry is in the possession of

the Registrar of Births and Deaths. Under section 57 (1) of the Registration

of Births and Deaths Act as amended provides that third copy of the birth

certificate (Birth Registration Entry) issued under section 11 A of the Act or

a certified copy of or a certified extract from, a registration entry obtained

section 56 shall be prima facie evidence of the birth, death or still birth to

8

which that copy or extract relates if that entry purports to have been made

in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

In view of the statutory provisions of law above referred to it can be

seen that certified copy of a birth certificate is issued only by the

Registrar of Births and Deaths or his Assistant Registrar and no other

person is authorized to issue certified copies of birth certificates. A true

copy of a birth certificate issued by a justice of the Peace is not a

certified copy as required by law.

I agree with the submission of Mr Shavindra Fernando and Mr. Niles on that

point in that, that the Justice of the Peace is not the custodian of the

original records relating to birth certificates and not authorized to issue

certified copies of birth certificates. And a certified copy of the birth

certificate can be issued only by the Registrar General of Births and or his

Assistant Registrar General.

Now I will deal with powers of the returning officer under section 31 (1)

and Section 31 (1) (b b b) to reject a nomination paper which reads as

follows:

31 (1) If The returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the nomination period, examine the nomination papers received by him and reject any nomination paper-

Section 31 (1) (bbb) reads as follows:

II Where as required by section 4 A of section 28, a certified copy of the birth certificate of a youth candidate or an affidavit signed by such youth candidate has not been attached to the nomination paper .. "

9

The returning officer has jurisdiction to reject a nomination paper if the

provisions of section 28(4) A have not been strictly observed by the youth

candidate.

Section 28(4) A of the law requires a youth candidate to either to attach a

certified copy of the birth certificate or an affidavit signed by him to prove

his date of birth. Once the youth candidate opts to furnish a birth

certificate or a certified copy thereof, the youth candidate cannot decide to

furnish a true copy of a photocopy of a birth certificate.

At the hearing of this application along with the connected applications

learned President's Counsel heavily relied on the judgment of Justice S.

Tilakawardane in CA application No. 325/2002 wherein Her Ladyship held

that a photocopy of a birth certificate shall be sufficient as there has been

a substantial compliance with section 28(4) A of the Law.

However, in the case of CA Writ NO.515/2002 decided on 10-09-2002

wherein it was held that

"Learned President's Counsel drew the attention of court to the case of

Jayaratne v Vaas Gunawardane and 114 others (CA 325/2002 CA minutes of

28-02-2002) wherein Ms Tilakawardane J. took the view that the returning

Officer should have considered whether there has been substantial

compliance with the provisions of section 31 (1) (bbb) of the Local

Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended and accepted the nomination

paper when a photo copy of the birth certificate is annexed to the

nomination paper. With utmost respect, I am unable to agree with the

view expressed by Her Ladyship Ms. Shiranee Tilakawardane J for the

reasons stated in this judgment above. I am strongly of the view that there

would be chaos if the court goes outside the intention of the Legislature and

creates a procedure to meet exigencies where court considers that the law in

force would work injustice. Legislation in my view, is not a matter for the

judiciary and the function of the court is to give effect to the expressed

intention of Parliament as gathered from the language used. Where the

meaning of a statute is plain nothing can be done but obey it. The learned

10

Deputy Solicitor General raised objections that the petitioner is guilty of

laches and that the necessary parties have not been made respondents. I

did not consider the two objections raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General in view of the conclusion arrived that the petitioner cannot succeed

in this application. The application is dismissed without costs".

Learned Deputy Solicitor General invited our attention to the paragraph

at page 102 and 103 of Granville Williams in Learning the Law and quoted

the following.

"Granted that words have a certain elasticity of meaning, the general rule remains that the judges regard themselves as bound by the words of a statute when these words clearly govern the situation before the court. The words must be applied with nothing added and nothing taken away".

The statute is clear and it cannot be given an extended interpretation.

The Rule is that the statutory provisions must be strictly interpreted when

its language and meaning is clear and unambiguous.

N.S. Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition at page 401

II Where the words of the statute are clear enough, it is not for the courts to travel beyond the permissible limits' under the doctrine of implementing legislative intention. When the legislation is unambiguous, the doctrine of telescoping the pragmatic construction and contemporaneous construction have no application"

In CA application No. 406/2006 decided on 10/03/2006 wherein a

similar issue was involved the court held

/I Having perused the said documents, court observed that what has been submitted were copies and not certified copies of Birth certificates as contemplated by section 31 (1) (bbb) of the Local

11

Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended by Act no. 2S of

1990 ..... "

In the case of CA Writ No.383/2006 decided on 24-03- 2006 court held that

II No certified copy of the birth certificate is annexed as contemplated by section 28 (4) A Accordingly court is satisfied that the returning officer strictly complied with section 31 (1) (bbb) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended. The court does not see any material to allow the application . The application is therefore dismissed. "

In a line of authorities of this court and the Supreme Court the issue

presently placed before this court has been decided concluding that the

statutory requirement for the youth candidate to furnish a certified copy of

the birth certificate is mandatory as required by section 28(4) A of the law.

Hence the provisions contained in section 28(4) A have to be construed as

mandatory. Furthermore I I observe that the failure on the part of the youth

candidate who intends to contest the local authorities election to strictly

comply with provisions in section 28(4) A of the Law is fatal to his

application.

I further observe that the Returning officer has not committed any errors

of law when discharging his duties and exercising his powers under section

31 (1) (bbb) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended is

justified in rejecting the nomination papers of the petitioner in this

application and in the connected applications on the basis that the youth

candidates have failed to furnish certified copies of birth certificates along

with the nominations as required by section 28(4( A of the Law.

12

This court is satisfied that the 2nd respondent has acted in compliance with

the law in rejecting the nomination papers and given reasons for such

rejection.

For the reasons stated above Court is of the view that reliefs sought by

the petitioners in this application and connected applications cannot be

granted in favour and the applications should be dismissed.

Accordingly this application and the applications nos. CA 128/2011, CA

140/2011, CA 165/2011, CA 166/2011, CA 189/2011 ,CA 141/2011 ,CA

146/2011, CA 153/2011, CA 161/2011 and CA 177/2011 are dismissed.

order no costs.
