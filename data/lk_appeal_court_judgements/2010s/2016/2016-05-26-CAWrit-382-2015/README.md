JUDGMENT

P PADMAN SURASENA 1

RESPONDENTS

The Petitioner is a Lieutenant Colonel (temporary) who is presently serving

as the Civil Coordinating Officer of the 66th Division of Sri Lanka Army

based in Poonerin. In these proceedings he challenges the decision of th(~

1st and/or the 2nd, 4th, 6th - 8th Respondents to retire him from Sri Lanka

Army with effect from 28th November, 2015 without confirming him in the

rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

4

It is for that purpose that the Petitioner in his petition has prayed for inter

alia,

a) a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing any decisions

and/or determinations made against the Petitioner reflected in P

~ and/or P 7(a) and/or P 7(b) and/or any other document

incidental thereto;

b) a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

reflected in P 5 and/or P 7(a) and/or P 7(b) placing the Petitioner

under retirement.

c) a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

reflected in P 5 and/or P 7(a) and/or P 7(b) in so far as they affect

the Petitioner.

d) a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

and/or the determinations made against the Petitioner by the Army

Selection Board No.2 reflected in P 5 and/or P 7(a) and/or P 7(b)

and/or any other document/s incidental thereto;

e) a mandate in the nature of~Writ of Mandamus compelling anyone or

more of the Respondents to confirm the Petitioner in the rank of

5

Lieutenant Colonel w.eJ. 2010-09-02 together with his consequential

entitlements thereto;

f) a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition on the Respondents

prohibiting the Respondents from retiring, discharging or removing

the Petitioner from SL Army without confirming him in the rank of

Lieutenant Colonel w.eJ. 2010-09-02;

This court, when this application was supported for notices, having

being satisfied that there is sufficient ground, has granted the interim

relief as prayed for in the petition, suspending the operation of the

impugned documents marked P 5, P7(a)and P 7(b). Thereafter, as tile

Respondents had objected to the extension of the stay order, this court

\

\rfixed the inquiry for 2016-02-16 to decide whether or not the 'stay order

should be further extended. On the said date of inquiry, extensive

r

submissions made by the learned counsel for both parties setting out:

their respective positions in this case amounted to a full argument of

this case.

They dealt with all the issues that should be argued in this case. Hence,

the inquiry relating to the extension of the stay order admittedly turned out

to be the " argument proper' of this case. In view of this, both counsel

6

agreed that they will supplement their arguments with a set of written

submissions only and rely on the submissions they made on 2016-02-16

and then leave the matter in the hands of the court thereafter to fix a dat 2

for the pronouncement of the judgment.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that this

decision, namely the decision of the 1st and/or the 2nd, 4th, 6th - 8th

Respondents to retire the Petitioner from Sri Lanka Army with effect from

28th November, 2015 is ultra vires the authority of that decision making

body.

The purpose of convening the said Army Board is clearly mentioned in R 7

and that is "recommending suitable senior officers for confirmation in the

rank of Lieutenant Colonel of SLAVF".

It is interesting to note that the paragraph 1 of this document reads as

follows. " .... Board having assemblid pursuant to the order proceeded to

consider criteria and pre requisites laid down and perused following

documents for the purpose of recommending suitable T/Lt Cols who have

completed more than 01 x year SVC in the temporary rank up to BolInt !(~

7

and backlog Offr of SLAVF seniority for the rank confirmation ... " This

clearly shows that the task assigned to, and the power conferred on this

Board, had been to make recommendations of suitable officers for

confirmation in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of Sri Lanka Army Volunteer

Force.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner drew our attention to the document

marked R 6 which is a regulation made under Section 155 of the Army Act.

Regulation 16 sets out the requirements that a candidate should have

fulfilled for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

According to regulation 17, recommendation for promotion under

regulation 16, shall be made by the commander of the army on the advice

of a Board of Volunteer Force officers consisting of not less than 3 officers

(Volunteer) of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel or above.

The said Board appOinted for the above purpose in its recommendation

appears to have proceeded out of the perimeter of its authority, and ~tated

in its recommendation " .... therefore based on past poor disc reasons, Offr

could not be recm for the rank confirmation in this attempt. Further, Army

Board no. 2, considering the gravity of severe offence of misappropriation

\

f

8

and monetary irregularities in the PRI and Canteen, directed the Offr to be

retired with effect from 28. 11. 2015; 1 x year period from the date the

board assembled at AHQ ... "

It is clear that the effect of this recommendation is to have the Petitioner

retired from service against his will. It is the submission of the learned

counsel for the Petitioner that such a step could only be taken through

regulation 32 of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer

Reserve) Regulations 1985 (the document marked R 6)

Respondents have not adduced any material before this court to show that

such a procedure has been followed against the Petitioner.

The document marked R 7 and produced by the Respondents is the

document which contains the Sri Lanka Army Board decision which the

Respondents had sought to enforce by the letters marked P 5, P 7(a), P

7(bl.

In the course of the argument learned Deputy Solicitor General who

appeared for the Respondents sought to argue that there is no decision in

the documents marked P 5, P 7(a), and P 7(b) as they are mere

communications.

9

It should be borne in mind at this stage that the Petitioner has had no

access to the said Board decision and that it was the reason as to why he

referred to this decision in his prayers (a), (b) and (c) as " .... decisions

reflected in P 5 and/or P 7(a), P 7(b) placing the Petitioner under

retirement. .. "

It is a common occurrence that a person filing a writ application seeking to

obtain a remedy against a decision by a public authority does not generally

have access to all the documents pertaining to such decision by that

authority. Such public authority also do not generally make available all the

documents to aggrieved persons voluntarily. It is therefore understandable

that the Petitioner may not have had an opportunity to peruse and then file

in court, all the documents relevant in order to more fully explain the

injustice caused to him. However, this court is of the view that the

Petitioner has adequately described in his prayers, the decision he has

chosen to challenge. Indeed in his petition it is not at all difficult for this

court to understand the purpose of the documents marked P 5, P 7(a)

and P 7(b). These documents have sought to enforce the decision that

,'t;.. was taken by the Army Board in the document marked R 7.

10

Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Respondents relied

on the documents R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4(a), R 4(a), R 4(b) and R Sto

argue that the Petitioner is not a fit officer to be retained in the Sri Lanka

Army. These documents themselves show that all those acts (referred to in

those documents) alleged to have been committed by the petitioner have

been considered as breaches of discipline, and had been dealt with at

those respective moments by the Respondents. The Respondents had only

chosen to warn the Petitioner and had not chosen to do anything more at

those respective moments. The conclusion that this court can reasonably

arrive from these facts, contained in these documents, which have been

relied upon by the learned DSG, is that it was not the considered view of

the Respondents that any of these breaches of discipline was serious

enough to have the Petitioner retired from the service at any of those

previous occasions. Indeed at this instance the petitioner would not have

faced this situation of losing his job, if he did not go before this Promotion

Board for no such recommendation referred to in R 7 would ever have

been emanated.

For the foregoing reasons we hold that the deciSion of the Respondents to

have the Petitioner retired with effect from 28th November 2015 referred to

11

in the Army Board decision marked R 7 has been made by that board

without any such lawful authority conferred on that Board. Therefore that

decision is ultra viresthe power conferred on that Board. A writ of

Certiorari is therefore issued to quash that decision. As that decision stands

quashed, the directives contained in the documents marked P 5, P 7la),

and P 7(b) should also stand quashed. We order no costs.
