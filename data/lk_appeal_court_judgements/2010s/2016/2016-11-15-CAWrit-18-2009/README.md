The petitioner is company incorporated under the laws of

Sri Lanka having engaged in the management and operation of

television stations under a license issued to it by the Ministry

of Media and Communication in conjunction with the

frequencies obtained from the Telecommunication Regulator

Commission.

The main issue in this application is whether the licenses

fee for the telecast of the TV programs recorded in tapes

imported by the petitioner is liable for custom duty.

3

It is an admitted fact that the tapes in question were

imported by the petitioner through the currier company DHL .

At the inquiry the accountant of the petitioner Company Mr.

B. U .A. Mendis admitted that the tax invoice P 14 b was issued

to the petitioner Company to reimburse the Customs duty and

other levies paid by DHL on Petitioners behalf. On the other

hand, the condition no I of the Air Waybill is that the DHL may

perform any of the activities mentioned in that condition on

shipper behalf. Sub paragraph (1) of condition I is that:

complete any document, amend any product or service code

and pay any duties or taxes required under any law or

regulation. It is clear that the currier company is only acting

on petitioners behalf as an agent. The importation of the goods

was done by the petitioner. The agent cannot be held

responsible for the offence of the principal because he is acting

on the instructions of the principal. As per condition 12 of the

Air Waybill all information provided by the shipper or his

representative is presumed to be correct and the currier is

indemnified against losses incurred on incorrect information.

Section 52 of the Customs ordinance imposes the forfeiture on

a false declaration. The section reads:

i

It

4

52 where it shall appear to the officers of the custom that

the value declared in respect of any goods according to

section 51 is a false declaration, the goods in respect of

which such declaration has been made shall be forfeited

together with the package in which they are contained.

Where such goods are not recoverable, the person

making such false declaration shall forfeit either treble

the value of such goods or be liable to a penalty of one

hundred thousand rupees , at the election of the

Collector of customs.

The petitioner argues that this section applies only

to the person who is " making such a false declaration"

and it is the currier company that has made the false

declaration and not the Petitioner Company. Even

though the penal statues need strict interpretation, as I

pointed out earlier, the currier company acted on

Petitioners behalf and on the presumption that he was

provided with the accurate information. The tax invoice

P 14 b confirms that the petitioner has to reimburse the

amount paid by the currier. By giving false declaration,

it is not the currier that was benefitted but it was the

petitioner. In these circumstance, though the declaration

was made by the currier, it was made on behalf the

petitioner on the information provided by the Petitioner.

5

Therefore it is the petitioner who has provided the

declaration in the instant case.

The next issue is whether the declaration is a false

declaration. Section 51 of the Customs Ordinance

provides for the declaration of the value of the articles

imported. The section read thus;

51 In all cases when the duties imposed upon the

importation of articles are charged according to the

value thereof, the respective value of each such

article shall be stated in the entry together with the

description and quantity of the same, and duly

affirmed by a declaration made by the importer or

his agent on a form of such size and colour as may

be specified by the Director - General by notification

published in the Gazette , and such value shall be

determined in accordance with the provisions of

schedule E, and duties shall be paid on a value so

determined.

Article 8 (1) c of the schedule E of the Customs

( Amendement) Act no. 02 of 2003 is the relevant

section for the instant case. The article reads;

6

1. In determining the customs value under the

provisions of Article 1, there shall be added to the

price actually paid or payable for the imported

goods.

(a)the following to the extent that they are

incurred by the buyer but are not included in

the price actually paid or payable for the

imported for the goods:-

(i) commissions and brokerage except buying

commIssIon

(ii) the cost of containers which are treated as

being one for customs purposes with the goods

in question

(iii) the cost of packing whether for labour of

materials

(b)the value apportioned as appropriate of the

following goods and services when supplied

directly or indirectly by the buyer free of

charge or at reduced cost for use in connection

with the production and sale for export of the

imported goods, to the extent that such value

7

has not been included In the pnce actually

paid or payable.

(i) materials components parts and similar

items incorporated in the imported goods:

(ii) tools dies, moulds and similar items used

in the production of the imported goods:

(iii) materials consumed in the production of

the imported goods :

(iv) engineering development art work and

design work and plans and sketches

undertaken elsewhere than in Sri Lanka and

necessary for the production of the imported

goods.

(c ) royalties and licence fees related to the

goods being valued that the buyer must pay,

either directly or indirectly, as a condition of

sale of the goods being valued to the extent

that such royalties and fees are not included

in the price actually paid or payable:

Indian Supreme Court in the case of Mis Associated

Cement Companies Ltd. V. Commissioner of Customs (A.I.R.

2001 Supreme Court 1. 862 at page 871) referring to a

technical advice held that" it is true that the appellants had

wanted was technical advice or information technology.

Payment was to be made for this intangible asset. But the

moment the information or advice is put on a media, whether

paper or diskettes or any other thing, that what is supplied

becomes chattel. It is in respect of the drawings, designs etc.

which are received that the payment is made to the foreign

collaborators. It is these papers or diskettes etc. containing

technological advice which are paid for and used. The foreign

collaborators part with them in lieu of money, it is, therefore,

sold by them as chattel for the use by Indian importer. The

drawings, designs, manuals etc. so received are goods on

which customs duty could be levied"

In the same case at page 876 Court referred to the case

of Advent Systems Limited V. UNISYS Coporation 925 F 2d

670 (3rd Cir 1991) where it has been held that computer

software was a "good".

In the case of BC Computres Ltd. V. U.S.Wickramasinghe

and others C.A. Application No.674/07 (Writ) C.A.Minutes

9

judgment in the case of s.c. Appeal 43 of 2004 S.C. Minutes

27.04.2006 where it has been held;

1. All tangible goods, wares and merchandise imported

in to Sri Lanka are subject to Customs duty;

11 Discus, magnetic tapes and CDs containing software

imported in to Sri Lanka constitute wares or

merchandise;

111 The focus of the Customs investigation is on software

imported as part of the tangible camer media, such

as discs, tapes and CDs;

1V In ascertaining the value of such goods, the value of

such tangible component thereof, is taken in to

account in conformity with the express provisions

laid down in 2.8.2 of the Schedule (e) of the Customs

Ordinances regarding intellectual property. (The said

Schedule has now been repealed by Customs

(Amendment) Act No.2 of 2003 and;

V It must be noted that the said taxation is tangible

unit and not intangible component, per se, and the

relevant item is taken as a whole for the purpose of

valuation.

Sriskandarajah J. further held that "the transacted value

between the parties are clearly borne out by their licence

agreement"

In the instant case the questioned tapes contain television

programs which are to be telecasted in Sri Lanka. These

television programs become "goods" or "articles" and attract

the custom duty.

As per article 8(1)c of the Customs (Amendment) Act, the

licence fee or the loyalty fee has to be included in to the value

of goods. The Petitioner Company has agreed with the owners

of the television programs to pay a licence fee for telecasting

the programs so imported. If fact the audit of the custom has

found that the Petitioner has paid a licence fee to the owners.

The law provides that the licince fee shall be added to the price

of the goods.

These TV Programs imported to Sri Lanka for the purpose of

telecasting them in the Petitioners TV channel. The

Petitioners do not sell the TV program directly to the general

public, but they earn money by telecasting these programs to

the public. Therefore, though it is not a direct sale, it

amounts to a sale.

The Petitioner knowingly that they are paying a licence fee,

they misdirected the customs through their agent, the currier

company, by declaring that the value of the goods imported is

only the value of the carrier media. It is a false declaration.

11

The Petitioner is guilty of making a false declaration to

customs on the importation of the tapes containing television

programs. The prerogative writ being a discretionary remedy,

the petitioner should come to Court with clean hands.

Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and others [1982J 1 Sri L R

368

A person who applies for the extra-ordinary remedy of Writ

must come with clean hands and must not suppress any

relevant facts from Court. He must refrain from making

any misleading or incorrect statements to Court.

In Halsbury Laws of England - Vol. II, 3rd Ed. page 71,

para 128 it is stated "on an application for relief the

utmost good faith is required and if the applicant in his

affidavit suppress the material facts the Court will refuse

an Order without going into the merits. JJ

In the instant case the Appellant's hands were not

clean from the beginning. He has given a false

declaration to the Customs to defraud the custom duty.

It is worse than non disclosure of material facts. The

Court cannot grant a discretionary remedy in such a

situation.
