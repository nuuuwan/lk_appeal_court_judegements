This matter is coming up for argument today. It is brought to

the notice of Court by the learned Deputy Solicitor General

obj ections for the granting the relief as prayed for in prayer

'D' to the Petition.

Considering the application made by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General, Counsel for the petitioner informs court that he will

not be pursuing for the other relief prayed in the petition.

Considering the above submission, we make order issuing a Writ

as prayed by the petitioner in prayer 'D' to the Petition,

directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to release 182 gold slabs to
