Respondent IS marked as P5. It IS contended by

the Counsel for the Respondent that the Appellant

has failed to mark the said documents accordingly.

Nevertheless it IS viewed from the document dated

21.09.2006, the 1st Respondent acting In terms of the

Rules 49 (X11)(A) had informed the Petitioner- Appellant

to deposit a sum of Rs. 203184/27, as the deposit,

to accept the appeal. The Petitioner - Appellant has

deposited only Rs. SO/as the fee for the acceptance

of the appeal, which is contrary to the above Rules.

Further it was informed by the 1st Respondent that

the said amount shall be made within 14 days

and the failure to do so, the appeal will be

rejected.

Besides, by the document

and for a writ os Mandamus to compel the 1st

Respondent to hold an inquiry before rejecting the

appeal.

It is salient to note that the Learned High Court

Judge by his order dated 03.02.2009, rendered

3

that the above decisions of the 1st Respondent IS

invalid and the same was quashed by the ISSUIng

a writ of Certiorari. But it IS observed by the said

impugned judgment that the Learned High Court

Judge has made order that the Appellant to deposit

the said sum of Rs. 203,234.26 within a

period and a directive was also issued to

Respondent, to hear the appeal and

specified

the 1st

to take

necessary steps accordingly. Further it was held that

if the Appellant does not deposit the said sum within

the prescribed time period the appeal to be

dismissed.

It is apparent that the Appellant had failed" to pay

the said deposit, but nevertheless had lodged the

instant appeal to have the said order of the Learned

High Court Judge to be set aside.

The pith and substance of the Appellant's argument

is that, the requirement to pay an appeal deposit in

terms of Rule 49( XII)(a) of Co operatives Law is ultra

VIres.

Further it IS contention of the. Appellant that as per

said rule that there was an. option "'---.... ,--LV LHL. Ciggneve

party to deposit either of two sums and the

Registrar of Co operatives Societies is bound to accept the appeal.

4

In essence it IS the position of the Appellant that

1 __ Hl;

was denied the procedural fairness by the 1 st

Respondent, by not accepting his appeal.

For convenIence and brevity the above Rule 49 (XII)

IS reproduce herein below;

"a. Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of

an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall be made

within 30 days from the date of the award by a

written statement setting out the grounds of--Appeal.

Every such appeal shall be forwarded to the Registrar

with an appeal deposit of Rs. SOl or 10% of the sum

awarded where the appeal IS made by the party

against whom the award has been made and by

Rs.501 or 10% of the sum claimed - in the dispute

where the appeal is made by the party claiming any

sum of money whichever sum IS higher sum In

either case.

(b) An appeal not made In conformity with the above

shall be rejected by the Registrar

(c) The Registrar may make a decision on the appeal

without hearing any parties to the dispute.

(0) where the Registrar IS satisfied that the --A!1pelh:mt

had reasonable grounds to appeal, the sum deposited

by him shall be returned to the appellant.

(e) here the Registrar IS satisfied that the appellant

had no reasonable grounds to appeal, the _ _ appeal

deposit shall be forfeited and credited to the

consolidated fund"

It IS the contention of the Appellants, that the

requirement to pay an appeal deposit In terms of

the Rule 49 (XII) (a) IS ultra vires. In addition it IS

stated that if the appellant has deposited either of

two sums of appeal deposit the Registrar of Co

operative Societies IS legally bound to accept and

hear the appeal.

It IS

of Rs. 203,234.26, three weeks from the said date of

In making the determination Learned High Court

Judge was of the VIew that as per Rules 49 (XII)(a)

has set out a deposit of Rs SO/will be sufficient

to accept an appeal, and was of the VIew that the

case of Sebastian .vs. Katana Multipurpose Co operative

Society, their Lordships had not made any observation

as to the said Rule whether it IS mandatory or

not, but Their Lordships oplnlOn cannot be treated

as the ratio decidendai of the. said <;::ase.

The Appellant without depositing the said amount had

Further Section 61 (1) of the above Act recognIses the

forms to be used, the fees to be paid, the

procedure to be observed and all other matters

connected with and incidental to the ptesehtation,

The said Rule 49 (XII) was published In the Gazette

The Appellant planks his argument on the decision of

To fortify the above position the Counsel for the

Respondent has also highlighted the case of

Therefore this Court IS persuaded to accept the

gravamen of the argument put forth -by the-.Counsel

for the Respondent.

To cap it all the Appellant's In ordinate delay In

making the instant application against the order of

the Learned High Court Judge will render the

application invalid.

Hence, when reviewed the facts in the said back drop

we are of the view that the appellant's appeal should

fail.

Accordingly we dismissed the appeal subject to a cost

of Rs. 10,000/.
