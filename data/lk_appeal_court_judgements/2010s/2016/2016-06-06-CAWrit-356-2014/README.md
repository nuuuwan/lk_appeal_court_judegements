JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The petitioner in this application has sought from this court inter alia:

1) a writ of certiorari quashing the decisions communicated by the 2nd

Respondent by letter P 21, and the decisions of the council in its 351 st

Meeting to appoint the 3rd Respondent as the Acting Dean of the

Faculty of Language Studies of Buddhist and Pali University of Sri

Lanka, and the decisions communicated by letter P 22,

2) a writ of Prohibition to prohibit the 1st Respondent and/ or 1st to 15th

Respondents and/ or 1st to 28th Respondents from calling any Faculty

Board Meeting and/ or holding any meeting of the Faculty Board for

the purpose of appointing a new Dean for the Faculty of Language

Studies of University of Buddhist & Pali during the Petitioners term of

office in terms of Section 18 C (2) of The Buddhist and Pali University

of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Act No. 37 of 1995.

The Petitioner has been unanimously elected as the Dean, Faculty of

Language Studies of University of Buddhist and Pali at a special Faculty Board

meeting which was held on 2014-09-24 for the purpose of electing a new

,t

~I

8

Dean for the Faculty of Language Studies of University of Buddhist and Pali

of Sri Lanka. Consequent to that election, secretary to the Faculty Board by

his letter dated 2014-09-24 had informed the 2nd Respondent that the

Petitioner was elected unanimously to function as the Dean, Faculty of

Language Studies of University of Buddhist and Pali of Sri Lanka with effect

from 2014-09-26 for a period of 3 years as per the special Faculty Board

meeting held on 2014-09-24 under Section 18 C of the Buddhist and Pali

university of Sri Lanka (Amendment Act No. 37 of 1995).

Section 18 C of the Act above referred to is as follows,

"(1) There shall be a Dean of each Faculty who shall be a full time officer of

University and the academic and administrative head of that Faculty. The

Dean shall be elected by the Faculty board from among the Heads of the

Departments of Study comprising such Faculty, and shall, when so elected

cease to be the Head of the Department of Study concerned."

Notwithstanding the said election and the subsequent letter by the Secretary

to the Faculty Board dated 2014-09-24 (P 20), the 2nd Respondent by his

letter dated 2014-10-02 (the document marked P 21), had informed the 3rd

Respondent that the 3rd Respondent has been appointed as the Acting Dean

of the Faculty of Language Studies of University of Buddhist and Pali, Sri

9

Lanka with effect from 2014-09-30 by the council in its 351 st meeting until a

new Dean is appointed.

It is the position of the Petitioner that this letter marked P 21 is arbitrary,

unreasonable, mala fide and is ultra vires the provisions of Section 18 C of

the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka Amendment Act No. 37 of 1995

and hence has no force or avail in law and therefore is a nUllity.

Perusal of the journal entries in the docket of this case shows that the

Respondents have been represented by a counsel on the notice returnable'

date i.e. 2014-11-03. Learned counsel who had appeared for the

Respondents had moved for time to file objections and that application had

been granted by this court. Thereafter this court, on the application of

learned counsel who had appeared for the Respondents had granted further

time at several occasions affording an ample opportunity for the

Respondents to file objections in this case. However, Respondents have

failed to file any objections in this case. Further, no counsel had appeared

for the Respondents thereafter. It was in this backdrop that this court had

decided to dispose this matter on the written submissions filed on behalf of

the Petitioner.

The facts, the legal positions applicable to this impugned appointment have

not been controverted by the Respondent. There has been ample

opportunity for them to do so if they had wanted to challenge these

positions. In these circumstances this court has no option but to conclude

that the position taken up by the Petitioner is correct.

The Respondents have failed to adduce any basis to justify the issuance of

letters marked P 21 and P 22.

In these circumstances this court issues

1) a writ of certiorari quashing the decisions communicated by the 2nd

Respondent by letter P 21, and the decisions of the council in its 351 st

Meeting to appoint the 3rd Respondent as the Acting Dean of the

Faculty of Language Studies of Buddhist and Pali University of Sri

Lanka, and the decisions communicated by letter P 22,

2) a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent and/ or 1st to 15th

Respondents and/ or 1st to 28th Respondents from calling any Faculty

Board Meeting and/ or holding any meeting of the Faculty Board for

the purpose of appointing a new Dean for the Faculty of Language

Studies of University of Buddhist & Pali during the Petitioners term of

11

office in terms of Section 18 C (2) of The Buddhist and Pali University

of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Act No. 37 of 1995.

Registrar is dir~cted to convey this order to the Respondents.

Application is allowed.
