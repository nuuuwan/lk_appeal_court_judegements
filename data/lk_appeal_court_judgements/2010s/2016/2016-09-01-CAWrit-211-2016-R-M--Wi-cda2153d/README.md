COUNSEL J.C. Weliamuna for the petitioner.

Chaya Sri Nammuni SC for the Respondents.

DECIDED ON: 28.07.2016

VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PC. J(P / CAl

Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned State Counsel

representing the respondents in this case.

Petitioner in this case who was an officer in the army had gone abroad in

the year 2005 without obtaining leave for employment. When he returned to

the country in the year 2013 he was apprehended at the airport and was

subject to a summary of evidence while he was assigned with certain duties

to perform. After the summary of evidence was recorded the Court Marshal

proceeding was commenced in the year 2014. The petitioner complaints

before this court that when he was apprehended in the year 2014 he was

treated only as an officer who had got absent without official leave (AWOL)

and not as a deserter.

In support of this position, petitioner submits before us three documents

which are marked P 4a, P 4b and P 4c. Petitioner had further taken up the

position that the said Court Marshal which proceeded for some time had

1

\ II tt

been cancelled since the judge advocate was retired and subsequently in the

year 2016 the 2nd Court Marshal was commenced with a new judge advocate

general. As submitted by the petitioner he was caught at the Airport when

he returned to Sri Lanka on 28.02.2013 and the 2nd Court Marshal was

commenced on 29.02.2013. One day after completing 03 years after his

arrest. The learned counsel for the petitioner brings to the notice of Court

Section 56 of the Army Act where it says that a Court Marshal cannot

commenced after 03 years of the date of offence unless the offence is one of

desertion and few other offences. Based on this fact, the petitioners argued

before this Court that the army had first considered him as a person who

had got absent without leave and if he is a person considered as a person

who is absent without leave then the army cannot proceed with this Court

Marshal after 03 years. He secondly takes up another position while

referring to the Volunteer Force Regulation, Regulation 29(6) and submits

that the only cause of action available to a volunteer force officer, for the

Commander to transfer him to volunteer reserve as stipulated in the above

provision.

Based on these grounds the petitioner has come before this Court seeking a

writ of certiorari to quash the decision to hold a Court Marshal, and to

quash the charges framed against him and also asking for interim relief in

order to suspend the Court Marshal proceedings which are in progress at

present. However, the learned State Counsel who is representing the

respondents has brought to our notice the provisions of Section 61(5) of the

Army Act and submits that Section 56 will operate subject to the provision

2

of Section 61(5) according to the said Section if there was a pending Court

Marshal, a fresh Court Marshal can commenced even after 03 years. She

further submits that the fresh Court Marshal which was commenced in

29.02.2016 was also based on the same charges levelled against the

petitioner in the first Court Marshal inquiry. Therefore she submits that

Section 56 has no application to the present application. With regard to the

charge of desertion, she brings to the notice of Court that Regulation 70( 1) &

70(1) -"up to 21 days no absentee shall be considered as a II

(2) of the Army Disciplinary Regulations which reads thus:-

deserter unless there are good reasons for satisfaction of

the Commanding Officer for supporting him that he has

}

deserted.

70(2) -"after 21 days every absentee shall pending investigations

be considered as a deserter".

As observed by this Court the said regulation is very clear when considering

an absentee to be treated as a deserter. In the present case the petitioner

was apprehended after 641 days of his absence. His absent is well over 21

days. After the Court of inquiry the army had decided to prosecute him for

desertion i.e. on the above facts it is clear that the army in this instance had

acted under section 70 of the Army Disciplinary Regulations. We observed

that 4(a) was issued immediately after he left the army in the year 2005 i.e.

well within 21 days period. Documents which were marked as 4b and 4c

are messages sent by various units immediately after his arrest at the

Airport prior to any decision based on the summary of evidence. With

3

regard to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner

based on Regulation 29(6) of the Volunteer Reserve Regulations, we observe

that this was another option available to the Army when a volunteer force

officer is found going abroad without obtaining leave. But it does not say

that it is the only available cause of action for a volunteer force officer.

Otherwise the provisions of the Disciplinary Regulations will become

nugatory.

For the above reasons, we see that the decision by the Army to Court

Marshal, the petitioner on a charge of desertion had been taken according to

the available provisions of the Army Act and the Disciplinary Regulations of

the Army. Therefore, we see no reason to interfere with any decision taken

by the Army to Court Marshal the petitioner and therefore we refuse to issue

notices in this matter.

Notices are refused.
