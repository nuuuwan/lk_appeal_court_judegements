BEFORE: Deepali Wijesundera J.,

M. M. A. Gaffoor J

COUNSEL: H. Withanachchi with S. Karunadhara for the Petitioners

Ravindranath Dabare for the 1st to 4th Respondents

Gamini Marapana, P.c., with Ms. Nishanthi Mendis for the 6th

Respondent

ARGUED ON: 04.05.2016

DECIDED ON: 03.08.2016

M.M.A. Gaffoor J.,

The Petitioners in this case filed their application on 27'07.2012 against

the Respondents seeking inter alia a Mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

quashing the license issued to the 6th Respondent by the 1st Respondent

Authority to carry out mining operations for gems in the land called IfPaile

Elhena Kumbura" and also the decision of the said Respondent Authority to

extend the period of License issued to the 6th Respondent.

It is common ground that the 1st Respondent is the National Gem &

Jewellery Authority, established in terms of Section 2(1) of the National Gem &

Jewellery Authority Act No. 50 of 1993, the 2nd Respondent is its Chairman, the

3rd Respondent is its Director General, the 4th Respondent is the Regional

Manager for the Eheliyagoda Regional Office, and the 5th Respondent is the

Secretary to the Ministry of Environment.

It is a requirement of the law that the applicant by himself owns the land

or holds together with the consenting co-owners 2/3 share of the land in

respect of which the license is applied for. If the applicant satisfies the

Authority that he owns or together with the consenting co-owners 2/3rd share

of the land, then the applicant is entitled to obtain the license for gemming in

that land.

The real dispute is about the ownership of the land called "Palle Elhena

Kumbura" between the 6th and the ih Respondents. In this case it is very clear

that the license has been finally issued to the 6th Respondent after several

inquiries, and therefore the judgment of Rodrigo J., in this unreported case No.

316/81 is not applicable to this case, as in that case no proper inquiry was held

before the issue of the license.

It is not disputed that the 6th Respondent had been earlier issued with

license for the same land called "Palle Yalhena kumbura" for the period from

02.02.2011 to 01.07.2011 and from 14.10.2011 to 07.07.2012 without any

objection from the Petitioners. This fact and the other relevant facts the

Petitioners have suppressed in'this case. "-.. ~.

The present dispute has arisen only when the 6th Respondent and the 7th

Respondent have made separate applications to carry out mining for gems in

the same land. Upon receiving these applications the authority had directed its

officers in Ratnapura to hold an inquiry and examine their rights to the land,

and to find out whether the respective parties have 2/3rd share or more in the

ownership of the land. For this purpose, the 6th and ih Respondents were

granted several opportunities to establish their rights to the land, but the 7th

I I , I 4 I 1 I Respondent had failed to appear on all the dates granted for inquiry. As such I I the Authority had decided to issue the license to the 6th Respondent. I I I The Petitioners state that subsequently the 7th Respondent complained !

to the 2nd Respondent against the decision to issue the license to the 6th

Respondent. On this complaint the 7th Respondent was noticed to appear for an

inquiry and after an inquiry the i h Respondent was considered to be issued

with the license but subject to certain conditions.

Later it appears that the 6th Respondent had appealed to the 5th

Respondent and subsequent to this appeal, the ih Respondent by his letter

dated 29.12.2010 informed the authorities that he was willing to withdraw his

application and consented to the issuance of the license to the 6th Respondent.

Accordingly, the license was issued to the 6th Respondent.

As far as the rights of the 6th Respondent to the land, he has submitted

the relevant deeds and the pedigree and the authorities had been satisfied with

them before issuing the license. The 6th Respondent has also submitted the

consent of all the parties on whom the rights of the previous owners, now

devolved and he has established that he has 2/3 rd share in the "land.

I am therefore of the view that the authorities concerned have issued the

license to the 6th Respondent after having been satisfied with the requirements

of the law and other connected matters for the issuance of the licence.

Considering the above reasons, I am of the view that the licence had been

issued to the 6th Respondent after proper inquiry and his ownership to the land

being satisfactorily established, as such the relief prayed for in paragraphs (b),

5

(c) and (d) of the petition cannot be granted and the petition of the Petitioners

is dismissed without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
