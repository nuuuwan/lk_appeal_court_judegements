L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is a revision application stemming from an order of the

learned High Court Judge ofPanadura refusing bail pending appeal.

3

The Accused was convicted after trial for the offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder and imposed a sentence of 7 years RI

and a fine of Rs. 15,000.00 with a default term of 6 months by the

Panadura High Court. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and

sentence, the accused preferred an appeal to this Court. While the appeal

is pending, the Petitioner, claiming to be the brother of the accused,

presented an application for bail to the High Court of Panadura on behalf

of the accused. The learned High Court Judge, after an inquiry, dismissed

the application on the basis that the Petitioner has failed to establish the

exceptional circumstances. The Petitioner made this revision application

to this Court to revise the said order of the High Court.

The learned DSG raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner

has no locus standi to present a bail application and has no locus standi to

maintain this revision application and moved to dismiss the application in

limine. He further contended that there are no exceptional circumstances

for this Court to act in revision. Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that

the Respondent has refrained from taking any objection to the

maintainability of the bail application in the High Court and it is an

admission that the Petitioner has locus standi and he cannot raise that

objection at the appeal stage. He further argue that the power of revision

of this Court is very wide and even without an application, Court can act

on its own to revise any order or judgment of a lower Court. He further

submitted that a person aggrieved by the order can move in revision.

When an accused is convicted of a criminal offence, as of a right,

he can appeal against the conviction. Under section 320 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, a party to a criminal proceeding in a Magistrate Court

can make the appeal, subject to sections 317, 318 and 319. None other

than "a party" can make the appeal. Under section 331 of the Code, an

4

appeal against an order or sentence of a High Court may be lodged by

presenting a petition of appeal or application for leave to appeal to the

Registrar of the High Court within fourteen days from the date when the

conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed against was

pronounced. The proviso to the section provides how to file the petition

of appeal if the person is serving a jail term. The proviso reads;

Provided that a person in prison may lodge an appeal by stating

within the time aforesaid to the jailer of the prison in which he is

for the time being confined his desire to appeal and the grounds

therefore and it shall thereupon be the duty of such jailer to

prepare a petition of appeal and lodge it with the High Court

where the conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed

against was pronounced.

The words ''person in prison" means the convicted person. The

law does not provide any other person to file the appeal against a

conviction even if the person is serving a jail term. It is the convicted

person that has to be satisfied or dissatisfied with the order of the High

Court and if dissatisfied, file an appeal. Before the enactment of the Bail

Act No. 30 of 1997, the law relating to the release of a convict by the

High Court was subsection (3) of section 333 of the Criminal Procedure

Code. The section reads thus;

(3) When an appeal against a conviction is lodged, the High Court

may subject to subsection (4) admit the appellant to bail pending

the determination of his appeal. An appellant who is not admitted

to bail shall pending the determination of the appeal be treated in

such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under the

Prisons Ordinance.

5

This section IS silent on the procedure of making the bail

application. The Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 is the current law governing the

bail. Section 20 of the Bail Act provides for the release of a person

convicted by the High Court. The section reads;

20.(1) ...... .

(2) When an appeal against a conviction by a High Court is

preferred, the High Court may subject to subsection (3) release

the appellant on bail pending the determination of his appeal

An appellant who is not released on bail shall, pending the

determination of the appeal be treated in such manner as may

be prescribed by rules made under the Prisons Ordinance

The subsection 2 of the section 20 of the Bail Act is word to word

the same law as it was in the Criminal Procedure Code. This law is also

silent on the procedure of making the application for bail. Who has to

make the application and how the application has to be presented are

matters that the Act has not provided for. It is being an application based

on evidence, it has to be presented by way of a petition and the facts have

to be established by an affidavit. Who can make the application is the

issue in the present case.

Learned Counsel for the Respondent cited the cases of Senathilake

v. A.G. [1998] 2 Sri L.R 290, Muthunayake Pediga Piyasili v. A.G. CA

(PHC) APN 18/09 (unreported case but has failed to tender a copy of the

judgment) and Sonali Fernando v. A.G. CA (PHC) APN 144/07 in

support of his argument that it is the accused that has to make the

application. The Counsel for the Petitioner distinguishes these cases on

the basis that they were the cases that the accused was absconding.

Whether the accused was regularly present in Court or absconded is a

6

material point when considering the issue of granting bail, but on the

issue of right of making the application, it is not material.

The three case cited by the learned Counsel refers to the issue of

locus standi in revision applications. I will consider them later in this

judgment.

An application to admit a convict to bail pending appeal is an

application for relief from Court. To present an application to Court he

must have locus standi. His Lordship A.W.A.Salam J. held in the case of

Sonali Fernando v. A.G. CA (PHC) APN 144/07 that;

In law, locus standi is generally understood to be right to bring an

action, to be heard in Court, or to address the Court on a matter

before it.

The Oxford Dictionary of Law defines the English meaning of the

Latin term "locus standi" as "a place to stand'. Its legal definition is "The

right to bring an action or challenge a decision". The Wharton's Concise

Law Dictionary revised and updated by Dr. Justice AR Lakshmanan,

former Judge of the Supreme Court of India defines the term as "The

right of a party to appear and be heard on the question before any

tribunaf'. The Black's Law Dictionary defines as "The right to bring an

action or to be heard in a given forum".

Who has this right to bring an action or who has the right to

address the Court? The answer is the person who was harmed or

aggrieved by the decision of the Court. In the case of Premadasa V.

Wijeyewardena and others [1991] 1 Sri L R 333 at 343 considering the

right to bring an application for writ of certiorari the Court held that;

The law as to locus standi to apply for certiorari may be stated as

follows: The writ can be applied for by an aggrieved party who has

7

a grievance or by a member of the public. If the applicant is a

member of the public, he must have sufficient interest to make the

appl ication.

In the case of A. R. Perera and others vs Central Freight Bureau of

Sri Lanka and another [2006] 1 Sri L R 83, the dictum of Lord Denning,

in R v Paddington Valuation Office (1996) 1 QB 380 at 401 on locus

standi that "The Court would not listen, of course to a mere busybody

who was interfering in things which did not concern him. But it will listen

to anyone whose interests are affected by what has been done" was cited.

In the present case, the bail application was filed by the brother of

the convict. The brother was not harmed by the conviction of the accused;

at least he doesn't say that he was harmed. His interests were not

affected. The only concern is that he is the brother of the accused. His

Lordship Salamj. in the Sonali Fernando (supra) case observed that;

In our society parental affection flows naturally excels all others.

When such affection finds no place to invoke the revisionary

powers, to recognize the conjugal love as a key to access such

jurisdiction would appear ridiculous.

A relationship, whatever the relationship is, is not a key to institute

an application in Court on behalf of any other person. The Criminal

Procedure Code does not provide for instituting action in representative

capacity other than for Attorney at Law to submit the application on

behalf of his client. The petition of appeal can be filed by an Attorney at

Law. Section 322( 1) of the Code refers to appeals from Magistrate

Courts. The section reads;

322. (1) Every petition of appeal shall state shortly the grounds of

appeal and shall be signed by the appellant or his attorney-at-law.

8

The section 331 (4) is on appeals from High Court. It reads;

331. (4) The petition of appeal shall be distinctly written on good

and suitable paper, signed by the appellant or his attorney-at-law

and dated and shall contain the following particulars: -

If the appeal can be signed by an Attorney At Law, there is no

reason why application for bail cannot be signed by an Attorney at Law.

The law has provided the right to be represented by an Attorney at Law.

Section 41 (1) of the Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978, lends support to this

interpretation. It states:

"Every attorney -at -law shall be entitled to assist and advice

clients and to appear, plead or act in every Court or other

institution established by law for the administration of justice and

every person who is a party to or has or claims to have the right to

be heard in any proceeding in any such court or other such

institution shall be entitled to be represented by an attorney -at -

law. "

If the person "claims to have the right to be heard" the Court has

to decide whether he has a right to make an application on behalf of

another person. The Court has to consider the fact that if the appellant can

instruct the Attorney at Law to file the appeal whiles he is in the prison,

why cannot he instruct on the bail application. No reason given in the

application.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted a hypothetical

situation where the application filed by a person other than the appellant

is refused and if the appellant comes forward and says that he has not

instructed to file a bail application to that person and present another

9

application, can the Court give a hearing to the appellant? This is also a

matter that has to be taken in to consideration.

My considered view is that it is only the appellant or on his behalf

an Attorney at Law can file the bail application. No other person has

locus standi to institute an application for bail.

Chapter XXIX of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for

Reference and Revision of the orders of the Magistrate Court and High

Court. Section 364 of the Code provides that the Court can call for and

examine any record. The section reads;

364. The Court of Appeal may call for and examine the record of

any case, whether already tried or pending trial in the High Court

or any Magistrate's Court, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to

the legality or propriety of any sentence or order passed therein or

as to the regularity of the proceedings of such court.

Sec 365 and 366 provides for the Court exercise the powers

conferred on Court under chapter XXVIII of the code, that is the chapter

on appeals.

The purpose of giving this power to the Appellate Courts is to

maintain the due administration of justice. The section 364 while giving

the power to call and examine the records of lower courts, it defines the

purpose as "for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or

propriety of any sentence or order passed therein or as to the regularity

of the proceedings of such court." The parties were not given a right to

be heard when the Court exercising the power under this chapter.

A revision application presented by an aggrieved party is different

from Court acting on its own motion. If a person says that he is aggrieved

by any decision of a lower Court, he must establish that how he was

10

aggrieved. It is a personal application presenting to Court praying for

relief saying that "I am aggrieved by what has been done by the Court".

He cannot rely on the power of the Court to act on its own. It was held in

the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara v. Veloo [2001] 3 Sri L R 91 at 103

that;

"Section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 364 of the

Criminal Procedure Code confer power on the Court of Appeal to

call for the records of the District Courts and Magistrate's Courts.

Those Sections cannot be construed as provisions which confer

rights on parties to make revision application. "

Article 13 8( 1) of the Constitution confer jurisdiction to act In

revision. The Court of Appeal Appellate Procedure Rules specify the

procedure of tendering a revision application. The learned Counsel for the

Petitioner submits that the rules do not specify the person who is entitle to

institute a revision application. Therefore, he argues that any person can

institute a revision application. That cannot be so, because the relief can

be granted only to a person entitle to it. The person who is entitled to

bring a revision application is a "person aggrieved" only.

The cases cited by the learned Counsel for the Respondent,

Senathilake v. A.G. [1998] 2 Sri L.R 290, Muthunayake Pediga Piyasili

v. A.G CA (PHC) APN 18/09 and Sonali Fernando v. A.G. CA (PHC)

APN 144/07 are on the locus standi of the petitioner In a reVISlOn

application. In Senathilake (supra) Court held that the father of the

accused has no locus standi to maintain a revision application to

challenge a conviction. Sonali Fernando (supra) is a revision application

filed by the wife of the convict to quash and reverse the conviction. The

Court held that the wife has no locus standi to prosecute the application.

(supra) case where it was held that the mother of the convict had no locus

standi. In Senathilake (supra) Court cited Albert v. Wedamulla [1997] 3

Sri L R 417 at 418 and Ceylon Mercantile Union v. The Insurance

Corporation of Sri Lanka 80 NLR 309 where the locus standi was

discussed. In the Mercantile Union case Court held that the union has no

locus standi to institute action on behalf of its member.

There is no doubt that the Court of Appeal will grant relief when

there is a miscarriage of justice or the order of the lower Court is palpably

wrong. There are series of cases decided by the superior courts on this

line. But who can ask for the relief is the matter that has to be looked into

in the present case.

The Counsel for the Petitioner cited the case of Bandaranayake v.

Jagathsena [1984] 2 Sri L R 397 and submitted that it is not necessary to

be a party in the original case as long as the matter is fit for review on

facts or law. In that case the accused were charged for insulting Mrs.

Bandaranayake and were convicted by the lower Court. In appeal Mrs.

Bandaranayake moved to address court as a party aggrieved. The Court

held that "Mrs. Bandaranaike was an "aggrieved party" and that this

status did not cease with the conviction of the respondents in the

Magistrate's Court. It was a status which continues until the final

disposal of the appeal. She was therefore, entitled to be represented in the

Court of Appeal and her attorney -at -law was entitled to be heard in that

Court. " the Court allowed the application of Mrs. Bandaranayake on the

basis that she is an aggrieved party.

In the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara (supra) it was held that

conceptually the expression Appellate jurisdiction included powers in

appeal and Revision, yet such power is subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law. It was further held that the "Revision is a

r

fI

I!i f

12

discretionary remedy, it is not available as of right. This power that flows

from Art. 138 is exercised by the Court of Appeal, on application made by

a party aggrieved or ex mero motu, this power is available even where

there is no right of appeal.

A revision application can be presented to Court for redress only

by a party aggrieved by what has been done by the lower Court. The

Petitioner in the present case cannot be considered as a party aggrieved

by not granting bail to the convicted appellant. It was his application that

was dismissed by the High Court but the purpose of presenting the

application was to obtain bail to the appellant.

In the present case the Petitioner filed the original application too.

One can argue that he has locus standi to present this revision application

to revise the order given in his original application, but since he has no

locus standi to make the original application, this revision application

fails.

Accordingly I dismiss this application. I order no costs.
