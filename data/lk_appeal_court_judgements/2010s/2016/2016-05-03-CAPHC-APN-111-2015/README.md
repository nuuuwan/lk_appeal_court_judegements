The learned State Counsel has no objection to the application of the

Petitioner being allowed on heavy bail conditions, since the Suspect -

Respondent has been on remand for one year.

Taking into consideration all these matters, I am of the view that the

Suspect - Respondent in respect of whom the Revision Application is filed

is entitled to be released on bail.

As such, the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura dated 21.09.2015 is set aside and I direct that the Suspect-

Respondent be released on the following bail conditions:-

1. Cash Bail in a sum of Rupees One hundred thousand.

(Rs.l 00,0001-)

11. Surety Bail with two sureties of the value of Rupees five

hundred thousand (Rs.500,0001-) each.

,

111. The sureties should be family members of the suspect (wife,

children, parents, own brothers or sisters) .

IV. After the grant of bail, the Suspect-Respondent is directed to

report to the Officer in Charge of Rakwana Police Station on

the last Sunday of every month between 9.00 a.m. and

12.00noon.

v. Passport of the suspect is to be impounded, ifhe has one and if

not, the suspect has to tender an affidavit stating that he does

not possess a passport.

VI. Learned Magistrate is directed to inform the Immigration and

Emigration Authority accordingly.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this Order to the learned

Magistrate of Rakwana.

Registrar is also directed to issue a certified copy of this Order to the

Petitioner on payment of the usual charges.
