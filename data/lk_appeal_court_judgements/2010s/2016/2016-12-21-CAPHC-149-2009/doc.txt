On a complaint of robbery of a vehicle received by the police, the

Accused was arrested and the vehicle in dispute was also taken into custody

from the Accused and were produced before the Magistrate Court. After

conducting inquires the police informed the Court that the vehicle was

registered in the accused's name and there is no crime committed and

moved to discharge the Accused. Considering the report filed by the police,

the learned Magistrate discharged the Accused and released the vehicle to

the person from whom it was recovered, that is the Accused. (There was a

revision application before the High Court of Gampaha challenging the

release of the vehicle on a bond at the first instance and was dismissed. This

revision application is not from that order.) After discharging the Accused

an application had been made to the Magistrate Court on 27.05.2005 by an

Attorney at Law to issue notice on the Accused. The learned Magistrate

refused the application. The Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometime

called and referred as to the Petitioner) instituted a revision application in

the High Court of Gampaha to revise the said order. The learned High Court

Judge after inquiry dismissed the application. Being aggrieved by the said

order the Petitioner appealed to this Court.

The Accused and the registered owner of the vehicle involved in this

case is Jayasinghe Arachchige Wasantha Nihal. The complaint on the

robbery of the vehicle was made to the police by W.A.P.B. de Seram. The

revision application to the High Court was by one Liyana Arachchige Ivan

Gamini de Silva. He is neither the Accused nor the Complainant. He doesn't

claim the vehicle too. His application is to issue notice to the Accused and

to allow further steps to be taken as per the complaint of the vehicle

claimant complainant. If the Petitioner is not claiming the vehicle, he has no

locus standi to maintain an application on behalf of a third party claimant.

In his petition to the High Court the Petitioner doesn't plead that how

he was aggrieved by the order of the learned Magistrate. There is no reason

for him to be aggrieved on a decision made against a third party in relation

to a vehicle where he has no interest. Even if the application is considered in

the line of an aggrieved party, since the Petitioner is not an aggrieved party,

he has no locus standi to institute a revision application.

The police conducted inquires on the complaint received on the

robbery of the vehicle and found that there was no crime committed and

decided not to institute a criminal action against the Accused. Unless

otherwise directed by the Attorney General, the police have the right to

decide whether there is evidence to institute criminal action. If the inquires

reveled that there is no crime committed the only option available to police

is to inform the Court that no crime committed. In the present case the

police did informed the Court accordingly.

If no crime committed, the property taken over by the police from the

person suspected that has committed the crime, must be returned to the

person from whom it was taken over. The reason is if there is no crime is

committed, the property is also not involved in any crime. If there is any

dispute to the ownership of the property, the parties have to resolve to civil

action to vindicate their rights.

Mariyathasan v. Margaret Rose 71 NLR 164

When a police officer seizes any property alleged to have been stolen

but does not proceed with the case, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction

to order the restoration of the property to a person other than the

person from whose possession it was taken.

Under section 419 of the Criminal Procedure Code the property

seized by the Police must, if there is no inquiry or trial pending in the

Magistrate's Court, be restored to the person who had possession of it

at the time of the seizure and not to any other person who claims it.

COSTA v. PEIRIS. 35 New Law Reports 326 at 328,

The possession of property cannot be lightly interfered with, and I do

not think it has power under the section to order property seized and

removed from the possession of one person to be given to another

person. If a Court under section 413 finds that an offence has been

committed in respect of property produced before it or that it has

been used for the commission of an offence, then it may make order

interfering with the possession of the person from whom the property

was taken. If it does not arrive at one of these findings then the

''person entitled to possession" is the person from whom it was taken.

Any person disputing his rights must do so in civil proceedings

No criminal action being instituted against the Accused, the learned

Magistrate correctly returned the vehicle to the person from whom it was

taken over by the police. The learned High Court Judge has correctly found

that there are no errors on the face of the order of the learned Magistrate.

I see no reason to interfere with those findings.

The appeal is dismissed.
