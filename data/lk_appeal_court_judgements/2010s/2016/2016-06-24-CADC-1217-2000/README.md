H. C. J. Madawala, J

25/04/2016 23 /06/2016

This is a revision application filed by the 6th Defendant- petitioner to set aside the judgment of the

District Court of Gampaha dated 5/8/1985 an lor in the alternative to vary the said judgment to the

extent to include the rights ofthe petitioner in accordance with her title deeds and in the alternative

to order a trial de novo and for cost. When this matter came up for argument on 28/6/2012 the

counsel for the 3rd defendant-respondent raised the following preliminary objections,

1) The order in this case has been delivered as far back as in 1995 and the petition has filed

in October 2000 that is nearly after 5 years. Therefore the petitioner is guilty of laches and

the petitioner has not averred any explanation for this undue delay.

2) The petitioner has failed to aver exceptional circumstances warranting your Lord Lordships

court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

3) Petitioner has alternative remedy that is statutory right of appeal which he has not exercised

in this application.

4) The petitioner has failed to aver and or annex the order delivered by the Learned District

Judge in a similar application made to the District Court by the petitioner as depicted by

Journal entry 114 and 115.

Parties moved to file written submissions with regards to the said preliminary objections and

accordingly the 6th defendant- petitioner 3A substituted- defendant- respondent has file there

written submissions.

The plaintiff-respondent instituted the partition action No PI1467 in the District Court ofKaluthara

seeking to partition the land called "Mananegodella" described in the schedule to the original

plaint, in extent of AO R3 P 37. The said action which was instituted in Kalutara was transferred

to the District Court of Mathugama after the constitution of the District Court in Mathugama. The

impugned order has been delivered on 29/6/1995 and the present application had been filed in

October 2000, after 5 years.

In this plaint the plaintiff- respondent instituted partition action in the District Court of Gampaha

instituted against 1 st to 27th defendant- respondents seeking to partition the land called

"Millagahawatte" containing in extent of 3 bushels paddy sowing. A commission was issued to

the court commissioner to prepare the preliminary plan and accordingly plan No. 358 dated

22/10/1977 had been submitted to this court. That the 27th defendant respondent had intervene to

this action to the said preliminary survey. As well as at various stages of the action and had been

made parties to the action. According to the plaint the petitioner had given rights only to the 1 st to

27th defendant- respondents and the other defendants have filed their statements of claims disputing

the pedigree of the plaintiff and the devolution of title given by the plaintiff. Although the 18th

defendant, who is her father was made a party to the action by the plaintiff and given rights in the

pedigree, said Marukku Fernando had a greater right and interest in the land sought to be

partitioned. The said Marukku Fernando who had a greater share of the land sought to be

partitioned had transferred all his rights, title and interests to his three children. The petitioner the

36th defendant- respondent and the 31 st defendant- respondent, as far back as 1949. The petitioner

was not made a party to the action by the plaintiff nor was her rights interests or the shares were

not disclosed in the plaint or the pedigree. The attorney-at-Law for the plaintiff had filed a

declaration under section 12 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, declaring that he had made all

the necessary persons, parties to the action, he had made an incorrect declaration in doing so as he

had failed to make the petitioner a party to the action in the first instance whose rights were duly

registered in the Land Registry and could have been disclosed in the event a proper search had

taken place. The petitioner stated that she was suffering from a mental disorder for a long period

of time and was under constant medical treatment for a considerable period of time and hence

could not intervene in the partition action due to the said illness. Her husband had left and deserted

her due to her ill health and the petitioner was looked after by a domestic servant during the said

period of time. During the year 2000 she came to know about the partition action from a relative

of the petitioner and made inquiries thereafter from the District Court of Gampaha. The partition

action had proceeded to trial on or about 23.03.1982 on the many points of contests raised on

behalf of the contesting parties and after trial judgment had been entered on 05-08-1985. The points

of contests had been answered in favour of plaintiff and had made order to partition the land in

suit on the pedigree and the schedule of shares given by the plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment dated 05-08-1985, the 19th defendant above named had preferred an appeal bearing No.

C.A. 874/85 (F). This appeal had been decided by this court on 02-07-1999 and by the said

4

"

judgment; the judgment of the District Court had been varied to the extent to exclude Lot 1 from

the corpus and subject to the said variation, the appeal had been dismissed. The petitioner had lost

her right, title and interests to the land in suit due to the plaintiff s willful act of not making the

petitioner a party to the actions. This had caused grave prejudice to the petitioner. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment the defendant- respondent above named had sought special leave to appeal

from the Supreme Court which refused the said application for special leave to appeal on 23-02-

2000.

The petitioner stated that her father is a direct descendent of an Original owner of the corpus who

in addition to the title and interests he got from his father one Manuel Fernando as pleaded by the

plaintiff in paragraph 17 of her plaint had become entitled to a further share by way of purchase

from other co-owners to the land in suit. The Said Marukku Fernando on deed No. 2722 and 2994

dated 02-08-1928 and 06-11-1928 respectively and attested by Mr. R.P. W. Senevirathne had

purchased a 346/1350 and 1/5 th share in his name and the said deeds too, had been properly

registered the said Marukku Fernando on deed No. 12281 dated 6-11-1948 and attested by Mr.

P.P. Jayawardena note to public transferred the said rights which were purchased on the

aforementioned deed of transfer marked 'X 3' to the petitioner and she in tum by deed No 16709

dated 5-5-1949 and attested by Mr. J.P. Wicramatillake Notary Public re-transfer the said share

back to her father said Marukku Fernando by deed for transfer bearing No. 16710 dated 5th May

1949 and attested by J.P.Wickramatillake Notary Public transfer all his rights, title and interest to

his 3 children, the 31 st defendant- respondent and the 36th defendant- respondent in equal shares.

The petitioner stated that thus she became entitled to a 1I3rd of an undivided 592/1350 share ofthe

corpus sought to be partitioned, and her title deeds were duly registered under the provisions of

the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. The petitioner stated that she had not disposed of the said

rights and interests which devolved on her by deed No. 16710 at all times material to the action

and hence the plaintiff should have made the petitioner a party to the partition action at the time

of institution. It was submitted that grate loss, damage and prejudice is caused to the petitioner by

the willful omission of her from the partition action. It was submitted that the instructing Attorney

-at -Law had failed to observe the mandatory provisions of the partition law. Further the Learned

trial Judge had failed to investigate the title of the parties as required by section 25 ofthe Partition

Law and hence the entire proceedings in the said action is tainted with illegality and impropriety

and bad on law. Further submitted that there is a fundamental error in the findings of the learned

5

I I

I , Trial Judge and hence the judgment is bad in law. The petitioner also stated that the plaintiff had

suppressed material facts which are of paramount importance to the case in obtaining a decree for

partition and hence the judgment is bad in law.

The 6th defendant-petitioner stated that according to judgment dated 24-10-66, the 7/128 share of

Fransinahamy remained unallotted as the alleged transfer deed was not produced, and in the

interlocutory Decree entered, a 7/128 less 118 of the land in 4D5 left unallotted. The interlocutory

decree was amended on 28-8-1968 and was entered allotting to, 7th defendant ( Hendrick) the

unallotted 7/128 less 118 of the land in 4D5 decree in the original interlocutory decree. The

petitioner stated that even in the amended interlocutory decree dated 28-11-1967 it was decree that

the 7th defendant is entitled to 7/128 less 118 of the land in 4D5. The petitioner gave evidence in

the District Court of Mathugama on 11-12-1992 and claimed the rights of the 7th defendant on the

basis of the pending partition deed No. 759 dated 3-11-1963 attested by Lal Wijegunawardana.

After the inquiry the order was made by the Learned District Judge, accordingly the 7th defendant

entitled to deed No. 3710. Thereafter the 7th defendant had transferred all rights, title interest and

claim to compensation to the petitioner by deed NO. 759 dated 3-11-1963. The right allotted to the

7th defendant under the amended interlocutory decree will devolve on petitioner upon entering of

the final decree, and the rights allotted to the 7th defendant in the interlocutory decree denied to

him under the final decree which when entered will by operation oflaw pass title to petitioner. The

petitioner made an application dated 13-3-1995 to the District Court of Mathugama to amend the

final decree in order to allot the unallotted share of Francinahamy to the party entitle to that share.

However The Learned District Judge dismissed the above petition dated 13-3-1995 after hearing

the application and delivered his order on 29-6-1995.

It was submitted that the rights allotted to the 7th defendant under the amended interlocutory decree

will devolve on petitioner upon entering of the final decree, and also there is no reason as to why

rights allotted to the 7th defendant in the interlocutory decree should be denied to him under the

final decree which when entered will by operation of law pass title to petitioner. It was submitted

that upon the perusal of the final decree that the 7th defendant who was declared entitled to an

71128 less 118 of the share ofthe land in 4D5 under the amended decree marked X6 and X7 does

not get any rights in the final decree. Therefore it was submitted that the rights of 7th defendant

have been wiped out under the final decree and this has given rise to a grave miscarriage of justice.

The petitioner is a bona fide purchaser on deed No. 759 for valuable consideration which is a

6

I I I I I

I I I ! [

I

perfectly valid deed under the Partition Law and the rights of 7th defendant will pass to him by

operation of law upon the entering of final decree allotting to him as decreed in the amended

interlocutory decree. It was submitted that there is a glaring irregularity in the final decree which

has the effect of a jUdgment in rem binding everybody. In order to correct the grave injustice that

has been caused by entering of an incorrect final decree it is necessary in the interest of justice and

on account extraordinary circumstances arising out of a patently irregular final decree for these

court in the exercise of the powers of revision to set aside the final decree and direct the District

Court of Mathugama to allot to parties their rights on the basis of the shares allotted under the

amended interlocutory decree.

Attention of Court has been drawn to the case Mariam Beebee Vs. Seyed Mohamed and others

68 NLR Page 36 SANSONI, C.J stated;

" The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent of and distinct from

the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is the due administration of justice and the

correction of errors, sometimes committed by this court itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of

justice. It is exercised in some cases by a judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved person who

may not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that, unless the power is exercised,

injustice will result. The partition Act has not, I conceive, made any change in this respect, and the

power can still be exercised in respect of any order or decree of a lower Court."

" It is open to another party to the action to ask this court in revision to set aside that decree (even

though it may have been affirmed in appeal) and to remit the case to the lower court in order that

proper steps may be taken in the action-see Chelliah V.Tamber (1 (7904) 5 Tamb. Rep. 52) ;

Menchina-hamy V. Muniweera ((1950) 52NLR 409); Somapala v.Sirimanne (3(1954) 51 O.L.W.

31 ) One reason is , I think, that a partition action has always been recognized as having a special

character, in that every party has the double capacity of plaintiff and defendant. Though in theory

it is merely a proceeding by one or more admitted co- owners against the remaining co-owners, to

obtain relief from the inconvenience of undivided possession, in practice it often involves a contest

as to title- see Luchihamy v. Hamidu. 4 (1923) 26NILI R. 41 )

According to the 6th defendant petitioner prayed that this court be pleased to exercise the power of

revision to set aside the order of the Learned District Judge, to amend the final decree to confirm

the amended interlocutory decree and for cost.

In Somawathie Vs. Madawala (1983) 2 SLR 15, Sc case 5 bench decision SOZA J

Stated;

"although the Act stipulated that decrees under the partition Act are final and conclusive even

where all persons concerned were not parties to the action or there was any omission or defect of

procedure or in the proof of title, the supreme Court continued in the exercise of its powers of

revision and restitution-in-integrum to set aside partition decrees when it found that the

proceedings were tainted by what has been called fundamental vice. In the case ofUkku v. Sidoris

T.S. Fernando J. (as he then was) declares as follows at page 93.

"While that section (i.e. Section 48 of the partition Act) enacts that an interlocutory decree entered

shall, subject to the decision of any appeal which may be preferred therefrom, be final and

conclusive for all purposes against all persons whomsoever, I am of opinion that it does not affect

the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court exercised by way of revision or restitution-in-integrum

where circumstances in which such extraordinary jurisdiction has been exercised in the past are

shown to exist."

The petitioner submitted that she is not seeking to set aside the judgment and the interlocutory

decree. However as there is a serious miscarriage of justice due to non-inclusion of the rights of

the 7th respondent in the final decree that he is entitled to have and maintain this application. It was

submitted that rights of the 7th defendant, whose rights have purchased by me on deed 759 (X8),

which rights were incorporated in the amended interlocutory decree were not incorporated in the

final decree entered in this case and state that this would cause a grave miscarriage of justice and

irreparable loss to the petitioner and that this court has extraordinary revisionary jurisdiction to set

aside same and make order to incorporate the rights of the 7th respondent. As there is a serious

miscarriage of justice that this court would not consider the delay and as no prejudice would be

caused to any party to this partition action. That the relief prayed for in the original petition be

granted from an unallotted share.

Accordingly the petitioner prayed to set aside the judgment of Learned District Court dated 5-8-

1985 and! or in the alternative to vary the said judgment to the extent to include the rights of the

petitioner in accordance with her title deeds are in the alternative to order a trial de novo.

3rd defendant- respondent objecting to the petition stated that the petitioner is not entitled in law to

have and maintain this actions for the following reasons.

(a) Laches

It was submitted that application by way of revision should be made within a reasonable

time period. The main criteria is only a party acts in due diligence entitles to obtain reliefs.

It was submitted that the impugned order had been delivered on 29-06-1995 and the present

application had been filed in October 2000 after five years. It was also submitted that no

explanation had been given in the petition for such a delay.

Lokuthuttiripitiyage Nandawathi Vs. Madapathage Dona Gunawathie and others CA

769/2000,DC Mt.Lavinia 33/921P it was held that,

" Filing an application by way of revision to set aside an order made by the District Court

3 Y2 years before the institution of the revision application is considered as inordinate delay

and the application is dismissed on the ground of laches."

V.A. Kusumawathy Vs. P.M.Y.B.Heenbanda (C.A. No. 1945/2001 (App) D.C. Kegalla

71M) The Court of Appeal held that the long unexplained delay disentitles the Petitioner to

get any relief by way of revision.

The petitioner in this petition had averred that she was suffering from mental disorder for

a long period of time and was under medical treatment for a considerable period of time

and hence could not intervene in this matter. However there is no proof of her condition

not at least a medical certificate has been attached.

Hence we find that the petitioner is guilty of laches as this explanations delay caused is not

proved.

(b) That the petitioner had failed to adhere to Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990.

Compliances with the said rules is mandatory in an application for revision and non-

compliance is fatal.

Rule 47 of Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) rules read as follows,

47:- The petition and Affidavit expected in the case an application for the exercise of the

powers conferred by Article 141 of the constitution shall contain an averments that the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal has not previously been invoked in respect of the same

matter. Where such an averment is found to be false and incorrect the application may be

dismissed.

The present petition does not contain averments required by rules and therefore must be

dismissed. The petitioner also has failed to file certified copies of relevant documents nor

has sought permission of court to tender the same subsequently. It was submitted that

irregularity is fatal for an application for revision.

Rule 3 (1) a of Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 impose mandatory duty

on the petitioner to file originals or certified copies of the documents along with the

petition. The final decree has not been produced to court.

In the case of M.M.lmamdeen Vs. Peoples Bank(C.A.L.A. 150/97) Justice Udalagama

adverting to the importance of compliance with the rules in refereeing an application has

said," perusing the brief we have no alternative but to uphold this objection. Except for a

certified copy of the order of the Learned District Judge dated 08-07-1997 the other copies

of the necessary documents filed are not certify. If certified copies could not have been

obtain in time it was the bounden duty of the petitioner to mention that in his petition, and

obtain leave of the court to tender them subsequently. The petitioner has failed to abide by

this provision."

The attention the Court is was also invited to the case of Urban Development Authority

Vs. Ceylon Entertainments Limited and another. 2002 BLJ 65 it was held, the original

documents or duly certified copies should be filed thereof in compliance with the Court of

10

Appeal ( Appellate Procedure) Rules and if there be any difficulty in tendering the original

or certified copies the Application should expressly reserve his right to tender them on a

subsequent date with leave of court.

In Vishaka de Alwis Vs. Weerasinghe Arachchige Asoka CA 779/2003 BASL News

JanlFeb 2007 it was held that the plaintiff has failed to comply with rule 3 (1) A Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990. On this grounds too petitioner's application

should necessarily be dismissed.

( c) Exceptional Circumstances

It was submitted that revisionary Jurisdiction vested in the Appellant Courts is an

extraordinary power which could be exercised only if the party seeking regards disclose

exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of superior court. Failure to aver

exceptional circumstances in the petition is fatal in an application for revision.

Mallawaarachchi et el Vs. Emalihamy et al CA Application No. 1452/2000 reported

in 2004 Jan! Feb News Letter

A preliminary objections was raised by the defendant- respondents that there was no

exceptional circumstances averred in the petition to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal. Their Lordships held that failure to comply with an established

important legal principle was fatal to the application for revision.

It was bought to notice of Court that the petitioner neither has pleaded exceptional

circumstances nor do exist exceptional circumstances in this case. It was submitted that

only revisionary Jurisdiction vested in the Appellant Court is an extraordinary power which

could be exercised only if the party seeking redress discloses exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the superior court. Hence it was submitted that the

petitioner's case must be dismissed for that reasons alone.

(d) It was also submitted that impugned order is an interlocutory order, which the petitioner

has the statutory right of Appeal first having obtained leave from court. In the instance case

the petitioner having failed to exhaust such right has preferred the present revision

application after 5 years. The appellant had not indicated to court that any special

circumstances exist which would invite court to exercise its powers of revision, particularly

since the appellant had not availed himself of the right of appeal under section 754 (2)

which was available to him no relief could be granted by way of revision. A revision is an

extraordinary jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal to be exercised under exceptional

circumstances, if no other remedy is available.

It was held, in the case of Vanik Incorporation Vs. Jayasekara 1997 (2) SLR 365

revision is not available until and unless remedy is available to the petitioner is exhausted.

The attention ofthe court was kindly invited to the case ofBoyagane D.C. Mills(Pvt) Ltd

Vs. Sardawathie Kumarihamy Wanduragala CA No. 122112000 It was held that,

"Since the statutes makes express provision under Section 754 (2) of the Civil Procedure

Code to make an appeal by way of leave to appeal against an interlocutory order by the

party dissatisfied with it cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal by way of

revision. "

(e) It was submitted that the caption of the version application filed by the petitioner. The

original caption and the entire caption is not mentioned. Hence the petition is liable be

dismissed.

Accordingly it was submitted for above reasons the petitioner's petition should be dismissed

in-limine.

The following Cases Law depict stated that the revision application cannot be maintained.

Davidson vs. Silva, 2 S.C.R. 10 Fernando vs. Fernando, 72 NLR 549

As a general rule, the Supreme Court will not, except in very exceptional cases, review an order

from which an appeal might have been, but has not been taken.

Navaratnasingham vs. Arumugam (1980 (2) S.L.R. 1) it was held,

Where petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court by way of revision as in the

present case, the court expects and insists on uberrima fides and where the petitioner's affidavits

contradict the record of the trial judge the court would be very slow to permit this.

Thilagaratnam Vs. Edirisinghe (1982(1 ) S.L.R. 56) Though the appellate court's powers to act

in revision were and be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against the order of the original

court or not such powers would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances.

Iynul Kareeza Vs. Jayasinghe (1986 (1) C.A.L.R. 109)

Though the powers of the Court of Appeal in revision are wide and exercisable whether an appeal

has been taken against the order of the original court or not, such power should be exercised only

in exceptional circumstances and having regard to the facts of each case.

The plaintiff-petitioner having sought and having been granted permission and having amended

the plaint failed to make application for leave to appeal from the order of the District Judge and

failed to show exceptional circumstances for revision by the Court of Appeal or to establish that

his substantial rights have been denied, an extraordinary remedy could not appropriately be

granted.

Hotel Gaalxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd. (1987)(1) S.L.R. 5)

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate court is confined to

cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

Wijesinghe Vs. Tharmaratnam (Sri Skantha Law Report Vol. IV, Page 47)

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the application discloses

circumstances which shocks the conscience of the court.

Samadh Vs. Musajee (1988 (2) C.A.L.R. 147)

That revision is a discretionary remedy and cannot be exercised except when there is no right of

appeal or there is no alternative remedy and exceptional circumstances exist to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. In the instant case there is no appeal but the party has an

alternative remedy by way of a separate action. But exceptional circumstances do exist in this case

in that if he does not invoke the jurisdiction of the court he runs the risk of being ejected from the

Premises which he is occupying.

Perera Vs. Peoples Bank (Bar Journal (1995) Vol. IV Part I page 12

13

r I ! I l

1! f ! I I

Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the petitioner is intensely relevant for the

granting of such relief.

On perusal of the record we find that the petitioner has failed to aver and or annex the order

delivered by the Learned District Judge in a similar application made to the District Court by the

petitioner as depicted by Journal entry 114 and 115. The petitioner has not exercised the alternative

remedy. As the final decree in case has not been produced for perusal and as the petitioner is guilty

of laches and the cause of the undue delay is not duly proved by forwarding medical certificate.

We uphold the preliminary objections raised by the 3rd defendant-respondent and accordingly we

dismiss this revision application with cost.
