Even though the Petitioner was an unsuccessful bidder to supply Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) to

the 1st Respondent Ceylon Electricity Board, his complaint before this court was mainly based on

Petitioner's duty to the Public as a Public Spirited Person to safe guard the safety of the General Public.

The main compliant of the Petitioner before this court was that the 1st to 16th Respondents have

awarded a tender to the 1 i h Respondent to supply 115000 Nos, of Miniature Circuit Breakers who has

not fulfilled the applicable standards referred to in Ceylon Electricity Board Specifications 020:2013

which was produced marked P-5.

When this matter was supported exparte before this court, this court observed that, "if substandard

MCBs were imported as submitted by the Petitioner it will be a threat to the standards maintained by

the 1st Respondent which will finally be passed to the ordinary citizen of the Country" and decided to

issue interim relief prayed by the petitioner in paragraphs (h) and (i) in addition to issuing notices on

the Respondents.

However when the Respondents appear before this court on notices, they objected to the extension of

the stay order and submitted that there is concealment and misrepresentation of material facts by the

Petitioner when supporting the matter before this court and moved that they be permitted to file limited

objections with regard to the extension of the stay order.

After all the parties filed their pleadings the matter was taken up before this court for inquiry into the

extension of the stay order and thereafter all the parties filed comprehensive written submissions before

this court elaborating their cases.

As observed by this court the Petitioner has heavily relied on the document P-5 when he supported the

matter before this court. In prayer (e) (t) and (g) to his petition the Petitioner had insisted the

implementation of standards referred to in P-5.

As submitted by the Petitioner, P-5 refers to Ceylon Electricity Board specifications with regard to

miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) issued in 2013 in order to replace the specifications issued in the

year 2007.

Under the said specifications applicable standards were referred to as follows;

4.0. Applicable Standards,

The equipment and components supplied shall be in accordance with the latest editions

of the standards specified below and amendment there to

(a) IEC 60898 -(2003) Electrical accessories

(b) IEC 60529 Degree of protection provided by enclosures (IP code)

(c) SLS 1175 : 2005 Circuit Breakers for over current protection for household and

similar installation

However in the event of Discrepancy the order of Precedence shall be as follows;

1. CEB specification

2. SLS Standards

3. IEC standard

Whilst referring to the said standards applicable when supplying MCBs to the lSI Respondent,

Petitioner had alleged that the selected supplier, i.e. the 1 i h Respondent has not fulfilled the applicable

standard, specially the SLS standard and not obtained SLS standard certification for the MCBs to which

the lSI Respondent had awarded the Tender.

During the inquiry before this court the 1 i h Respondent had challenged the above position taken up by

the Petitioner and submitted that, the 1 i h Respondent who is having a largest market share for MCBs in

India possesses all relevant specification including lSI (Indian Standard Institute) IEC (International

Electro-technical Commission) and SLS (Sri Lanka Standard Institute).

7

Whilst referring to the allegation of the Petitioner that the 1 i h Respondent is not a SLS compliant, the

1 ih Respondent had submitted that the above assertion by the petitioner is false and stated that SLSI

has duly granted Registration to the 1 i h Respondent under "Import Inspection Scheme".

The 1 i h Respondent had produced marked X-2. The import inspection scheme issued by SLSI under

which 5 categories were identified to obtain approval from the SLSI and submitted that the said

Respondent had selected category 4 in order to obtain approval from SLSI. The said category 4 reads

thus;

Category 4: Consignment of products carrymg "Product Certification Mark" of the National

Standards body of any country where the Standard used for said certification is

compatible with the corresponding Sri Lanka Standard Specification. Such

manufacturer should register for relevant products with the SLSI (refer Clause 2.3 of

Annex 3 GL-II-07).

Benefits to the Importer:

(a) If the product bears the Product Certification Mark of Sri Lanka Standard

institution (SLS mark) the consignment will be released for sale or use without

sampling. Samples will be drawn for random check once in eight consignments

and after sampling the consignment will be approved. However, the SLSI will

decide frequency of sampling based on the past performance of manufacturer and

the importer.

(b) If the product bears an acceptable Product Certification Mark of other countries

the consignment will be approved for sale or use without sampling. Samples will be

drawn for random check one in five consignments and after sampling the

consignment will be approved. However, the SLSI will decide frequency of

8

sampling based on the past performance of manufacturer and the importer.

(emphasis added)

As submitted by the 1 i h Respondents, the said Respondent had opted to come under category 4 (b)

where the product bears "an acceptable product certification mark of other countries" without having

SLS mark under category 4 (a).

The 1 ih Respondent had produced marked X-3 the approval obtained under the above category for

"INDO ASIAN" brand Miniature Circuit Breakers with the acceptable product certification mark (lSI).

Based on the above argument the 17th Respondent had submitted that he is fully compliant with SLSI

standards and therefore denied the argument of the Petitioner.

The 1 i h Respondent had produced marked X-5 the Sri Lanka Standards 1175:2005 for circuit breakers

for over current protection for house hold and similar installations. In the said standard under the

heading "National Foreword" it is stated,

This standard was approved by the Sectoral Committee on Electrical Appliances and

Accessories and was authorized for adoption and publication as a Sri Lanka Standard by the

Council of the Sri Lanka Standard Institution on 2005.08.11.

This is the First revision of SLS 1175. This revision introduces Circuit-breakers with screw type

terminals for external Aluminum conductors, Circuit- breakers with flat quick connect terminals

and Circuit-breakers with screw less terminals with external Copper conductors, and the

characteristic -Rated impulse withstand voltages for circuit- breakers.

This Sri Lanka Standard is identical with IEC 60898-1 : 2003 : Electrical Accessories, Circuit-

Breakers for over current protection for household and similar installations Part 1 : Circuit-

breakers for a.c operation, including Amd No.1: 2002 and Amd No 2: 2003, published by the

9

International Electro-technical Commission (lEC) except for the deviations given ill the

National Appendix.

During the argument before this court the Petitioner did not challenged that the 1 i h Respondent is an

IEC 60898-1 compliant but their main argument was that the 1 i h Respondent was not SLS 1175

compliant.

However when consider X-5 I see no difference between the two standards IEC 60898-1 and SLS 1175

when SLSI itself admits the two standards are identical.

During their argument before this court the 1 i h Respondent had further relied on the document

produced marked P-5 in support of his contention. The 1 i h Respondent had brought to our notice the

Ceylon Electricity Board specifications referred to in P-5. In the said Ceylon Electricity Board

specifications conformity with IEC 60898-1 had been identified as follows.

6.0 Basic Features

6.1 Design-

The circuit breaker time current operating characteristics shall conform to

type table 7 of lEe 60898-1

6.3 Terminals-

..... temperature rice for terminals and accessible parts shall conform to

the table 6 of lEe 60898-1

6.4 Operating Mechanism-

The operating mechanism of all the poles shall be according to the clause

8.1.4.4 of lEe 60898-1

6.5 Contacts-

f f I If

10

The contacts shall comply with clause 8.1.4.4 of lEe 60898-1, be of

high current carrying capacity with good resistance property.

6.8 Mechanical and Electrical Endurance-

The mechanical and electrical endurance of the Miniature Circuit Breaker

shall not be less than 4,000 operating cycles conforming to lEe 60898-1

8.0 Other Mandatory Requirements

8.1 Marking-

Each Miniature Circuit Breaker shall be marked in a durable manner with

the following particulars conforming to lEe 60898-1 ..

9.0 Information to be supplied with the Offer

9.2 -Following Type Test Certificate conforming to lEe 60898-1 shall provided with

the offer

11.0 Inspection and Testing

11.1 Inspection

Routine test reports as per lEe 60898-1 shall also be made for the

observation of the inspector.

11.2 Acceptance/ sample Test

The following Acceptance/Sample Test as per annex I of lEe 60898-1 shall be

witnessed by the representative of the purchaser. ... "

11

When going through the said specification this court observes that the Ceylon Electricity Board

specifications referred to in P-5 are wholly referable to IEC 60898-1 standard but not referable to SLS

specifications.

When considering the above arguments placed before this court by the 1 i h Respondent it is observed

by this court that the 1 i h Respondent had placed material for this court to satisfy that the

a) 17th Respondent is a SLS compliant.

b) SLS 1175:2005 is identical with lEe 60898-1 and the 17th Respondent is an IEC compliant

too.

c) Ceylon Electricity Board specifications referred to III P-5 are wholly referable to IEC

60898-1 and not referable to SLS specifications.

During the arguments before this court the 1st to 16th Respondents have approved the argument raised

f by the 1 i h Respondent and submitted that the said tender to supply MCBs to the 1st Respondent was I

awarded to the 1 i h Respondent after following the proper tender procedure including obtaining ! I

necessary TEC approvals as well. As submitted by the said Respondents the said tenderer was awarded

! II to the 1 i h Respondent, he being the lowest tender with the required standard to match the Ceylon I

Electricity Board specifications referred to in the relevant advertisement and the Ceylon Electricity

Board specifications referred to in P-5.

When considering the arguments place before this court by the Respondents, it is clear that the 1 i h

Respondent is a compliant with the standards referred to in the Ceylon Electricity Board specifications

020: 2013 which was produced marked P-5 by the Petitioner. Even though the Petitioner had taken up

the position that the present application was filed by him on his duty to the public as a public spirited

person, to safe guard the safety of the General Public, he being another competitor to supply MCBs to

the 1st Respondent, he should know better the requirements for each standard referred to above.

12

When going through the material submitted by the parties including the material submitted by the

Petitioner I find that the Petitioner had concealed material facts from this court when obtaining the stay

orders.

In this regard this court bears in mind the useful reminder of that celebrated jurisprudence as

propounded by Pathirana J in the case of A lponso Appuhamy V. Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131 at 135 that

a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts has to be placed before court when an application for a

Writ of injunction is made and the process of court is invoked. A party applying for a prerogative writ

is under a duty to the court to disclose all material facts within their knowledge, and this duty of

disclosure is similar to the duty on a party applying for an injunction. This useful guideline is equally

applicable to stay orders and since I find that the Petitioner has not kept to this duty this court is

compelled to vacate the interim order that has been granted on 21.09.2015.

Under these circumstances I am not inclined to extend the interim order this court has already issued on

21.09.2015 and vacate the same.
