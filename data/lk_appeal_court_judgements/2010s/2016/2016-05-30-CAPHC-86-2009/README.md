The instant order concerns an application made by

the Respondent to resolve the matter as to the

3

maintainability of the Petitioner's application as this

Court has no jurisdiction to maintain the same.

Before dwelling on the threshold lssue it is vital to

consider the background which led to the afore

said application of the Petitioner.

The Respondent- Petitioner by his petition has invoke

the revlslOnary jurisdiction of this Court to have

the impugned orders of the Learned High Court

Judge and the Learned Magistrate to be vacated.

The Applicant- Respondent- Respondent instituted action

In the Magistrate Court of Colombo, claiming

maintenance for her and for her adult son.

In pursuant to the receipt of summons the

Respondent- Petitioner, appeared In court and object

to the Petitioner's application in terms of section 4

(l)(b) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, as

the application for maintenance of an adult

offspring could be made only by the person himself

unless he or she IS incapable of making such

application.

in her application and thus ordered that these two

applications should be dealt separately.

In pursuant to the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge the Petitioner filed objections In the

Magistrate Court to the Respondent's application for

maintenance challenging the alleged m arn age

between him and the Respondent, on the basis that

the same court found him guilty for bigarny for

entering In to a marriage with the Respondent, as

the first marnage was never dissolved. Therefore it

IS common ground that there IS no valid marnage

between the Petitioner and the Respondent, and the

subsequent marriage was a nUllity.

The Learned Magistrate after hearing both parties

arrived at the conclusion and determination, made

order on 12th February 2007, wherein it was held

that the alleged marnage between the Petitioner and

the Respondent IS valid and as such the

Respondent IS entitled to . t . maIn~aJ.n her applkatiC'!l

for maintenance.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Petitioner

filed a revision application to have the above order

5

set aside. But as per judgment dated 10.06.2009,

the Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the

Petitioner's application, and as a result of which the

Petitioner has filed a Special leave to Appeal

application in the Supreme Court.

Nevertheless it 1S alleged by the Petitioner that

when the said application was supported 1n the

Supreme Court the Counsel for the Respondent had

objected to the said application on the basis that

the jUdgment challenged therein was made by the

Learned High Court Judge by exerc1s1ng its

rev1slOnary jurisdiction and therefore there 1S no

proV1slOn to file a Special Leave to Appeal

application 1n the Supreme and proper course of

action is to file an appeal in the Court of Appeal.

As a result of the afore said, the Petitioner was

compelled to come by way of a reV1SlOn application

as the appealable period had expired for the

,P-petitioner to preferFe6 an appeal.

When this matter was taken up for argument the

counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary

objection to the application of the Petitioner;

That the Petitioner has failed to comply with the

prov1slOns of section 14(2) of the Maintenance Act

No. 37 of 1999 which states thus;

" Any person dissatisfied with an order made by a

High Court In the exerCIse of its appellate

jurisdiction under this section, may prefer an appeal

therefrom to the Supreme Court, on a question of

law, with the leave of the High Court and where

such leave is refused, with the special leave of the

Supreme Court had and obtained."

It is contended by the Petitioner that an appeal to

the High Court under the Maintenance Act IS

available only against an order awarding

main tenance made under Section 2 or 11 of the

above Act. ~e categorical position of the

Therefore it IS said that the Learned Magistrate's

order was not an appealable order and it is by

way of a reVISIOn the petitioner has come to the

High Court to have the said order set aside.

It IS also alleged by the Respondent that the V Petitioner has fai~ to adduce exceptional

circumstances to invoke the revlslOnary jurisdiction

of this court as well as In the High Court.

It 1S vital to note the Article 154 P (3)(B) of the

Constitution which states thus;

Every such High Court shall

" notwithstanding any thing 1n Article 138 and

subject to any law, exercise appellate w."'1Y f8v18:on3...i.jT

jurisdiction 1n respect of convictions, sentences and

orders entered or imposed by Magistrate Courts and

Primary Courts within the province."

The substantive principle of law regarding the above

position was authoritatively laid down 1n case of

RUSTOM .VS. HAPANGAMA AND COMPANY-1978-79-(2)

225

"The power by way of reV1SIOn conferred on the

Appellate Court are very wide and can be exercised

whether an appeal has been taken against an order

of the original court or not. However, such powers

would be exercised only In exceptional

and as to

It 1S salient to note that Article 154 P (6) of the

Constitution has expressly recognized the exerC1se of

the Appellate jurisdiction over the final order,

judgment, or sentence of any such Court in the

exerC1se of its jurisdiction under paragraph 3(b), 3(c)

8

or (4) may appeal therefrom to the Court of

Appeal in accordance with Article 138.

Nevertheless it is position of the Petitioner that In

the first instance as he appealed to the supreme

court by special leave to appeal, and later on he

moved to withdraw the said application and by

that time the appealable period has lapsed, and as

such the Petitioner had no other option other than

to make this revision application to this Court.

Therefore it is contended by the Petitioner that as

the impugned judgment IS ex facie incorrect and as

there was a necessity to obtain

sufficient grounds to invoke

jurisdiction of this court.

a stay order are

the revlslOnary

It IS apparent that our Superior Courts had

allowed and had entertained reVlSlOn applications

even when a right of appeal was available to the

petitioner. To buttress the above position the

counsel for the Petitioner has cited the following

cases;

RANASINGHE AND OTHERS .VS. L.B. FINANCE LTD

[2005 (2) S.L.R.- 393- has observed thus;

"that it IS settled law that the superior courts

have the power to revise an order made by an

original court even an appeal has been taken"

9

Therefore 1n the above factual matrix it 1S

abundantly clear that the Learned Magistrate has

made a perverse order when he rendered that the

petitioner should pay maintenance to the Respondent.

The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

10.06.2009 has affirmed the said impugned order of

the Magistrate.

.J-kM-It is the stance of the Respondent /.'. the instant..L----

reV1sIOn application 1S In respect of

maintenance therefore the petitioner should have

complied with the Section 14(1) of the Maintenance

Act.

In that it IS said that 1n the instant matter the

Petitioner has failed to prefer an appeal to the

High Court as provided 1n section 14(1) of the

Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, instead the

Petitioner has preferred a reV1SIOn application to the

High Court.

To cap it all it 1S stated by the Respondent if the

petitioner IS to challenge the order invoking the

revIsIOnary jurisdiction one must establish the

existence of exceptional circumstances for the High

Court as well as this court to exercise~ the same. ~

Therefore it is reiterated by the Respondent that the

Petitioner should have acted 1n terms of Section 14

(2) and preferred an appeal to the Supreme Court

without making the present application by revision.

10

The counsel for the Respondent rest his argument

on the basis that the impugned orders from the

Magistrate AND the Learned High Court Judge

relates to the orders made on payment of

main tenance. But it is seen from the said impugned

orders that the said orders relate$ only to th~

issue whether the Respondent is entitled to maintain

her application for maintenance despite the fact that

the Petitioner's first marnage has not been

dissolved, and disregarding the fact that he was

charged for bigamy and convicted in lhe CaSe; No.

56041/01/93.

Therefore a mere cursory glance at the afore said

situation, it IS apparent that the Learned

Magistrate's order IS an incidental one which does

not fall within the purview of Section 14 (1) of the

afore said Maintenance Act.

Hence In the above setting it IS abundantly clear

that the Petitioner's first m arn age has not been

dissolved, at the time, the marnage with the

Petitioner took place. As a result the Petitioner was

charged In the said Magistrate Court case and

convicted.

In the said back drop the m arn age between the

Petitioner and the Respondent IS null and void.

Nevertheless the Learned Magistrate by the said

impugned order pronounced that the Respondent

11

\ I

~ f I I !'

could proceed with her application for maintenance,

even when there IS no valid marnage In existence

between the Petitioner and the Respondent.

Hence this court is of the view that a tread bear

evaluation by the Court below of the factual and

legal matrix emerged In this application, we are

compelled to arrive at the irresistible conclusion that

the preliminary objection of the Respondent should

stand rejected.

Thus the preliminary objections are over ruled, and

matter is fixed for argument accordingly.
