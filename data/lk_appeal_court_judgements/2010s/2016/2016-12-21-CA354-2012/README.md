On 17.05.2000, the Assistant Divisional Secretary of Alawwa has

informed the Petitioner that a preliminary investigation with regard to

the charge of producing a fraudulent Birth Certificate when the

petitioner was appointed to the Government Service has been

commenced.

At the preliminary InqulfY, the Additional Registrar Kurunegala has

given evidence and had stated that he had by his letter dated 31.06.2004

(PI6) addressed to the District Secretary of Kurunegala indicating that

the birth certificate bearing no 6941(P2) where the date of birth recorded

as 21.06.1956 was correct and the certificate bearing 6941 where the

date of birth reflects as 21.06.1960, was a false certificate.

The petitioner in his declaration made under section 21 of the W & O.P

Fund Ordinance had on page 2 declared that his date of birth as

21.06.1960. He had entered the said false date of birth, 21.06.1960, in

the History Sheet and had signed it. It had also been signed by the

Administrative officer on behalf of the Maspotha District Divisional

Secretary.

According to the document produced marked P15 at the inquiry the

Petitioner had certified as a true copy on the reverse of the fraudulent

birth certificate where the date of birth appears as 21.06.1960.

The Petitioner had also certified as a true copy on the reverse of his

genuine birth certificate bearing No. 6941 being the date of birth as

21.06.1956 produced marked P8 at the inquiry. Administrative officer

W.M Wijesinghe has testified at the inquiry to the effect that both the

birth certificates are found in the personal file of the Petitioner.

At the inquiry held against the Petitioner he was found guilty of all four

charges leveled against him. Having considered the disciplinary inquiry

report, the 1 st Respondent had terminated the services of the Petitioner

by the letter produced marked P8. The Public Service Commission and

the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had dismissed the respective

appeals lodged by the Petitioner.

At the hearing before this court, the learned Senior D.S.G took up a

preliminary objection to the effect that the jurisdiction of this court is

ousted by Article 61A of the Constitution. It was held in Rathnasiri and

Others V s Ellawala and Others 2004 2SLR 180 that Article 61A seeks

to oust the jurisdiction of courts to review determination of the PSC

except where there has been a violation or imminent violation of a

fundamental right. The ambit of the Article 61A is discussed in detail in

the above mentioned judgment. On that ground alone the application of

the Petitioner can be dismissed.

The other objection taken up by the learned Senior D.S.G is that the

petitioner had not made members of the Public Service Commission and

the Administrative Appeals tribunal (Who took the decision) parties to

this application.

In Wijerathna Vs Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero (S.C

Appeal No.84/2007; S.C Minutes 14.10.2011) the Supreme Court held

that:

"The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an

application for a writ of certiorari is that the person or

authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be

quashed should be made a respondent to the Application. If it

is a body of persons whose decision or exercise of power is

sought to be quashed each of the persons constituting such

body who took part in taking the impugned decision or the

exercise of power should be made Respondent. The failure to

make him or them Respondents to the application is fatal and

provides in itself a ground for the dismissal of the application

in limine."

As the Petitioner has failed to name necessary parties to the Application,

this court upholds the preliminary objections raised by the learned

Senior D.S.G in forming a ground to dismiss the Application.

This court is of the view that the writ jurisdiction of this court is ousted

by Article 61A of the Constitution with regard to this matter.

In view of the aforementioned reasons the application is dismissed with

cost fixed at Rupees 25,000/-
