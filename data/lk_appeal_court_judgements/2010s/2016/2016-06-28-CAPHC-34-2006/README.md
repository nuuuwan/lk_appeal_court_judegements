This is an appeal from the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Negombo. The Informant Respondent - Respondent, the O.I.C. of the M.a.

Branch of the Police Station Divulaapitya filed information in the Magistrate

Court of Minuwangoda under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act

on a land dispute threatening breach of the peace on a complaint made by the

1 st Respondents Petitioners Appellants (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Appellants) to the police stating that the 2nd Respondents - Respondents -

Respondents (hereinafter called and referred to as the Respondents) have

erected a fence and dug up a pit to construct a gate post obstructing their right

of way. The learned Magistrate, after taking necessary steps under part VII of

the Act, determined that the Respondents are entitled to erect the fence and to

dig up the pit to construct the gate post. Being dissatisfied by the said order,

the Appellants moved in revision to the High Court of Negombo. The learned

High Court Judge dismissed the application. This appeal is from the said order.

The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision application

basically on the absences of exceptional circumstances and the non disclosure

3

of material facts. The Learned High Court Judge held that unless there are

exceptional circumstances, the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court

cannot be exercised.

This case instituted under the Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure

Act. It is a temporary remedy of dispute settlement through a Court of law to

prevent the occurrence of the breach of the peace. Section 74 of the Act

provides that the determination of the Primary Court is in operation till the

matter is finally settled by a competent civil court. Further the Legislature

intended to bring about finality to the special procedure provided in the

Primary Court Procedure Act for dispute settlement by withdrawing the right

of appeal expressly. The section 74 of the Act reads thus;

74. (1) An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any right

or interest in any land or part of a land which any person may be able

to establish in a civil suit; and it shall be the duty of a Judge of a

Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry under this Part to

explain the effect of these sections to the persons concerned in the

dispute.

(2) An appeal shall not lie against any determination or order under

this Part.

Under this circumstance, if the Court allows exercising the revisionary

jurisdiction on the non availability of an appeal alone in a case instituted under

Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act, it will become doing something

indirectly which cannot be done directly. It is not the scheme of the Part VII of

the Primary Court Procedure Act or the intention of the Legislature.

Edussuriya J. (PICA) (as he was then) in the case of Letchumi v. Perera and

another [2000] 3 Sri L R 151, referring to the judgment in CA application No.

141190(1), observed that "Justice Senanayake in the course of his judgment

commenting on the language used under Section 329 stated, "in my view this

4

Section gives an alternative remedy to an aggrieved party in such a situation.

It is the duty of the Court to carry out effectually the object of the statute. It

must be so construed as to defeat all attempts to do so or avoid doing in a

direct or circuitous manner that which has been prohibited or erljoined

(Maxwell Interpretation of Statutes) 12th Edition Page 137. "

On the other hand, the law has provided that a determination of the

Primary Court under this part is not a bar for a civil action. The alternative

remedy of instituting action in a competent civil court is available for the

aggrieved party. Under these circumstances, unless exceptional circumstances

pleaded and established, revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be

invoked.

It has been held in several authorities that if an alternative remedy is

available, exceptional circumstances must be established to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction.

Attorney General V Podisingho 51 NLR 385

Held, that the powers of revision of the Supreme Court are wide

enough to embrace a case where an appeal lay but was not taken. In

such a case, however, an application in revision should not be

entertained save in exceptional circumstances, such as,

(a) where there has been a miscarriage of justice,

(b) where a strong case for the interference of the Supreme Court has

been made out by the petitioner, or

(c) where the applicant was unaware of the order made by the Court of

trial.

Rustom V Hapangama & CO. [1978-79-80J 1 Sri L R 352

The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary

powers of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that

these powers will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy

available, only if the existence of special circumstances are urged

necessitating the indulgence of this Court to exercise its powers in

revision

Bank of Ceylon V Kaleel and others [2004J 1 Sri L R 284

(1) The court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has

given the plaintiff-petitioner an alternative remedy (s. 754(2)) and when

the plaintiff has not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances

warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

Per Wimalachandra, J.

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged

must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous

which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary

per-son would instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a

nature which would have shocked the conscience of court. "

In the case before us, the Petitioners have not pleaded any exceptional

circumstance other than the so called errors committed by the learned

Magistrate. They are arguable points. They do not constitute a manifest error

in the determination. The learned Magistrate has considered the facts and the

law relating to the case and came to the finding. Therefore, the mistakes or the

errors said to have been committed by the Learned Magistrate do not require

the intervention of the appellate court by way of revision.

The Petitioners have already utilized the alternative way of seeking

relief by filing an action in the District Court of Negombo. They have not

6

disclosed that fact to the Court. In a revision application uberrima fide of the

applicant is a pre condition. In the case of Navaratnasingham v. Arumugam

and another [1980] 2 Sri L R 1 it has been held that "where a petitioner

invokes the jurisdiction of the Appellate Court by way of revision as in the

present case, the Court expects and insists on uberrima fides and where the

petitioner's affidavits contradict the record of the trial judge the Court would

be very slow to permit this. "

The Petitioners tendered a document marked as X with the petition and

relied on it. The Petitioners cannot tender new documents with the revision

application in support of their claim because the learned Magistrate did not

have the privilege of looking at it.

The Learned High Court Judge correctly dismissed the reVISIOn

application. I see no reason to interfere with the order of the Learned High

Court Judge.

For the reasons stated above, I dismiss the appeal subject to costs fixed

at Rs. 10,0001-.
