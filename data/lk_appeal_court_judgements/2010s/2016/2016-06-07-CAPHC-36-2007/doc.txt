P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal lies against the. order. -of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 15/03/2007 for

having set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate

dated 29 .. 06.2005, for allowing an application for an

order to demolish an unauthorised str-uetur-e effected

by the Respondent- Petitioner-Respondent.

The Applicant - Respondent - Appellant instituted action

in the Magistrate Court of Gangodawila in terms of

Section 28(a) (3) of the Urban Development Authority

Act No. 41 of 1978 as amended by Act No. 4 of

1982 and Act No. 44 of 1984, sought an order to

demolish an unauthorised structure effected by the

Respondent at No. 8/2A, Sirigal Mawatha, Kalubovila,

to viz;

1. At the back space of the land the part of

building the extent of which IS 3~.Y X 14 bl; 1.6

feet,

2. In the northern boundary the part of the

triangular building which IS In extent 42 X 15

that the said constructions are not unauthorised and

had not tendered an approved plan but had placed

the facts in writing and stated that Dehiwala- Mount

\I(

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent-

Petitioner - Respondent had by way of a Revision

made an application to the High Court to have the

said order revised.

It IS seen from the said impugned order of the

Learned High Court Judge, was persuaded by the

fact that Applicant - Respondent - Appellant IS not the

Municipal Commissioner, to whom the Urban

Development Authority authorised to prosecute under

Section 23 (5) of the Urban Development -Authority

Act No.41 of 1973 as amended by Act No.4 of

1984 and No. 44 of 1984.

It IS apparent from the letter marked PI dated 01 st

April 1985, the Board of Members of the Urban

Developmen t Authority had delegated the powers

stated there under to the Municipal

Commissioner /Mayor of Dehiwala/Mount Lavinia.

~_ -&t ~t is viewed from the document marked PI it

IS the Municipal Commissioner has instituted action

In the Magistrate Court Gangodawila and moved for

notices on the Respondent.

It IS also contended by the Applicant- Respondent-

Appellant that the relevant Section that propelled the

Applicant to exerCIse his powers is stated below;

Section 23(5) of the UDA Act as amended by Act No.4 1982

7

ti I1 I ! i t II

t

"the Authority may delegate to any officer of a

local authority in consultation with the local

authority, any of its powers, duties and functions

relating to planning, within any area declared to be

under Section 3, and such cr a, development area

Yofficer shall exerCise , perform -ef discharge any such

power, duty of function so delegated, under the

direction, supervision and control of the Authority."

The said powers were recognised in the case of

KURANGAMAGE HARISCHANDRA PERERA .VS.

MUNIYANDI PANEER SELVAM (sc appeal 123/09) which

held thus;

In the above case it was observed that the Court

of Appeal had held that the Petitioner had acted

without jurisdiction in

relevant Magistrate's

Development Authority

making the application to the

Court and that the Urban

had no power or jurisdiction

to delegate its powers to the Petitioner to file action

against the First Respondent, as Section 23(5) of the

UDA Act as amended by Act No. 4 of 1982

permitted delegation of powers duties and functions

relating to planning only to the Petitioner.

Thus, the Court of Appeal by its judgment held as

follows;

" hence any unauthorized structures put up . by the

Respondent falls within the definition of "development

activity" as provided in Section 29 of the Law.

8

When any "development activity" IS commenced,

continued, resumed, or completed without a permit

issued by the third Respondent In the development

area, action has to be taken only by the Urban

Development Authority, In terms of Section 28A of

the UDA Law and not by the officers of the Local

A h " ut onty ...

But it IS seen from the document marked PI the

members of the board of Urban Development

Authority, acting In terms of Section 23(5) of the VDA law No. 41 of 1978, had nominatfr;l authorised,

and appointed the Mayor/Municipal Commissioner of

Dehiwala - Mount lavinia, to act, implement, arid make

representation, and attend to all matters pertaining to

planning and development regulation functions of the

Urban .... ,

Therefore it IS apparent that the Municipal - council

was empowered to take any action regarding not

only matters relating to planning but also any

matter In respect of development aciivity. Ii is

contended by the Respondent that the Applicant-

Appellant has failed or neglected to satisfy the

Learned Magistrate that the required procedure pnor

to an application for demolition has been duly served

on the Respondent.

The

least

categorical position

notice of 7

of the Respondent is -that at

days were not gIven. But

9

II II

t

nevertheless it viewed from the notices on page 45

and 51 dated 22.04.2004 has gIven a date as on

or before 18th of May for the demolition of the

said unauthorised structure.

The Counsel for the Respondent has adverted this

Court to the order of the Learned Magistrate which

has dealt with document marked P4, and it IS

emphasized of the fact that P4 refers to construction

of an unauthorized parapet wall. It is stated by the

counsel that the Learned Magistrate has issued an

order to demolish the following constructions

purported to be unauthorised.

1. At the back space of the land the part of

building which IS In extent 33.9 X 14 & 7.6 feet

2. In the Northern boundary the part of the

triangular building which IS In extent 2 X 6 X 6'. o on the boundary wall In the same building.

3. Boundary wall which is In extent 17'. X 9.6"

Therefore it IS contended by the Respondent that

she was not served with a notice as required by

law namely In terms of Section 2RA (l~ of the

Urban Development Authority Act No. 41 of 1978 as

amended by Act No. 4 of 1982 and 44 of 1984,

and there by had caused a great miscarriage of

justice, by not serving the required legal notice.

Hence it

Respondent

IS reiterated by the Counsel

that the applicant - appellant

for the

has not

!II I

followed the proper procedure, before making an order

for demolition.

The Counsel for the Respondent has also stressed

the fact the Learned Magistrate has failed to gIve

proper notice with regard to the unauthorised

constructions by only referring to a 'WALL.

But it IS seen from the document marked as P4

which IS the notice under Section 28 A (1) of the

above Act, the Applicant - Appellant had gIVen a

vivid descri ption of the nature of the unauthorized

structures effected by the Respondent.

It IS pertinent to note that in the impugned order

the Learned Magistrate has made a reference to the

fact that the Applicant - Respondent - Appellant has

not authorised the construction of the alleged wall.

In the last paragraph of the said impugned order of

the Magistrate refers not only to one construction

but to 'unauthorised constructions' to be demolished.

Therefore the argument of the Respondent IS baseless

and unmeritorious and should stand rejected.

Besides it is pertinent to note that the Respondent-

Petitioner - Respondent has not alleged the said reason

In the Revision application and no order regarding

the said issue had been made by the Learned High

Court Judge.

11

1II f

In the said impugned order of the High Court

Judge deals with only one issue, viz - a - viz whether

the plaint to the Magistrate Court WciS tendered by

the proper officer, who is authorised to do so.

It IS also worthy to note that the Respondent has

not taken up the above objection In the High

Court. Nevertheless this court IS of the VIew that

the Respondent was not prejudice by the said

contents.

In addition it IS to be noted that the Respondent

has not taken up the afore said objection In the

Magistrate Court. Nevertheless this court IS of the

VIew that the above action was filed by the

authorised officer from the Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia

Municipal

Respondent

Council,

proceedings In acting Section 23 /1.

will

of

It IS the contention of the Respondent that the

Appellant did not have any authority to make the

purported application to the Magistrate Court for the

demolition of the construction effected without a

prior approval of the UDA.

The Respondent planks her contention on the premlS that the Authority can delegate powers, only In

respect of matters relating to planning and not for

any act of development activity.

12

\ t I

As per Section 23 subsection 5 of the Urban

Develop Authority states thus;

"The Authority may delegate to any officer of a

local authority, In consultation with that local

authority, any of its powers, duties and functions

relating to planning within any area ............ "

But it IS salient to note after the said amendment

came In to operation In 1982, and the said

document marked PI by which the UDA delegated

its powers to the Mayor / Municipal Commissioner to

attend to all matters relating to planning and

development activities was much later than the above

amendment.

Therefore in the above setting it IS abundantly clear

that the Mayor / Municipal Commissioner' was

authorised to attend to matters relating to planning

and development activities too. Further it IS

abundantly clear that the notice In terms of 28

(a)(l) read with 28(a)(l) has been sent by Municipal

Commissioner. Therefore this Court IS of the VIew

that the Applicant - Appellant has followed the proper

procedure and the Respondent was not denied

procedural fairness.

For the reasons as set out above . it IS apparent

that the Learned High Court Judge has erred in

the above vital Issue by allowing the application of

the Respondent - Petitioner - Respondent by setting

aside the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Hence I set aside the order of the Learned High

Court Judge and gIve effect to the order of

Learned Magistrate accordingly.

Thus I allow the appeal.
