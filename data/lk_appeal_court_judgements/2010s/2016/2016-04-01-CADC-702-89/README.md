P.R.Walgama, J

The question 1n this appeal 1S whether the Court

below was correct in its reason1ng and conclusion.

The Plaintiff- Appellant (in short the Appellant)

instituted action against the

(in short the Respondent) for

Defendant -Respondent

the following reliefs

prem1ses more fully

liquidated damages 1n a sum of Rs 10,000/.

Further for damages 1n the sum of Rs.BOOO / and

for continuing damages at Rs. 400/ per month from

1 st April 1979 till the Plaintiff is placed in vacant

possessIOn in the premises in suit.

For the sake of convenience and brevity I would

refer to the relevant facts thus;

On or about 6th November 1974 the Appellant

allowed the Respondent to occupy the suit prem1ses

free of rent bearing No.6, C.M.A. Housing Scheme,

2nd Lane, Beddagana Road South, Pita Kotte.

The Respondent has entered the subject premIses as

a licensee and while was In occupation entered to

an Agreement with the Appellant to purchase the

said premIses for a sum of Rs. 45,000/ . The said

'dossier' was attested by S. Gnanapandithan N.P. on

14th February 1975 and bears the No. 431, and it

IS now marked as A.

At the execution of the said Agreement Respondent

paid Rs. 10,000/ to the Appellant as an advance of

the purchase price of Rs. 45,000/.

In addition the parties bound themselves by the

terms stated herein below;

1. The Seller doth here by covenant and agree to

sell and convey unto the Purchaser within three

months, the property and premIses described In

the schedule hereto for the pnce or sum of

Rs.45,000/

2. Should the Purchaser be unwilling or refuse to

purchase the property and premises except for

the reasons stated in clause 9 hereof when the

said seller is willing to sell the same then the

Seller shall be entitled;

a. To forfeit the said sum of Rs. 10,000/

paid as an advance, or

b. To enforce the specific performance,

c. To be paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/ by way

of liquidated

penalty.

damages and not as a

It is said that the Appellant failed and neglected to

purchase the said property and there by the said

sum of Rs. 10,000/ was forfeited.

The pith and substance of the Responden t's case

was that he had been payIng to the National

Housing Commissioner on behalf of the Appellant for

the advance obtained of Rs. 15,000/ obtained by

him. It IS alleged by the Respondent that he was

ready to pay the balance money and the Appellant

had evaded the acceptance of the same, and thereby

had failed to execute a Deed of Transfer in favour

of the Respondent. Further it is said that there was

no time limit or sun set clause In the said

agreement.

It is categorically stated by the Respondent that the

Appellant has will fully refrained from calling over at

the State Mortgage Bank to accept the balance

money due on the transaction and to execute the

Deed of Transfer.

In addition it IS said that the payment of the

balance money and to execute the Deed of Transfer

was extended from time to time.

Therefore In the above context the Learned District

Judge was of the view that the afore said material

warran ts a specific performance In favour of the

Respondent.

The Learned District Judge In evaluating the

testimony of the Plaintiff was of the view that he

had taken different positions and therefore it lacks

probity.

Further it IS apparent that the Plaintiff - Appellant

has extended the period of payment by the letter

marked P2 till the 31.07.1977. It IS intensely

relevant to note that the Defendant- Respondent has

already paid more than half of the agreed amount

by payIng Rs. 25,000/ to the Plaintiff - Appellant.

- Appellant who was reluctant to honour the said

Agreement.

The Learned District Judge has also appreciated the

fact that the Defendant's endeavour to f'-11fi! i:he

conditions In respect of the payment by applying for

a loan from the State Mortgage Bank, and the

Learned District Judge was also of the VIew that

the Plaintiff- Appellant has not challenged the said

position as such it IS obvious that the Defendant-

Respondent was always willing to purchase the suit

prem1ses.

It 1S transpired from the impugned judgment and

the Learned District Judge has adverted to the

documents marked P12,P13 and P14 and was of the

VIew that the Plaintiff -Appellant has acted In a

manner to stultify the Agreement marked PI. Further

the said position 1S fortified by the document

marked P16 too.

The Defendant - Respondent was not in a position to

deposit the balance money In Court as he was

unable to obtain the loan from the State Mortgage

Bank due to the act of the Plaintiff - Appellant.

Therefore In the said backdrop the Learned District

Judge was of the V1ew that the Plaintiff-Appellant

It was also the view of the Learned District Judge

that the time factor is not in 1ssue 1n respect of

and decreed that the Defendant - Respondent 1S

accordingly.
