L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The Accused Petitioner (Hereinafter sometime called and referred

to as the Petitioner) was indicted in the High Court Kaluthara on three

charges namely, abduction of a miner child under 16 years of age and two

charges of rape committed on the miner child on two consecutive days.

2

After trial the Petitioner was found guilty on all charges and was

sentenced as follows;

For the first charge 7 years RI with a fine ofRs. 10,0001-

For the second charge 20 years RI with a fine ofRs. 10,0001- and a

compensation ofRs. 300,0001-

For the third charge 20 years RI with a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and a

compensation ofRs. 300,0001-

All sentences to run concurrently.

The petitioner moved in revision against this conviction and

sentence, but at the argument stage, the petitioner did not contest the

conviction and the fine and the compensation part of the sentence. He

moved this Court to revise only the custodial part of the sentence. The

learned SSC did not object to revise the custodial part.

The Petitioner and the Prosecutrix were having a love affair for

some time before this incident took place. She has willingly come with

the Petitioner and lived with him. When the relatives came to take her

home, she has refused to go with them. After the incident, the Petitioner

was willing to marry her but her parents have objected. These facts were

admitted by the prosecutrix.

In a charge of rape committed on a girl less than 16 years of age,

the consent of the prosecutrix is immaterial. Having sexual intercourse

with such a person, whether she consented or not, the act itself constitutes

an offence. When it comes to the sentence stage Court can consider the

attended circumstances. The amended section 364(2)( e) of the Penal

Code provides that the Court can impose a custodial term of 10 to 20

years RI. In the present case the Learned High Court Judge has ordered

the maximum term of imprisonment on both charges of rape. The

3

Learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration to the

difference between a brutal rape committed on a child using force and

having a sexual intercourse with his lover with consent. In the first said

situation the rapist must be punish severely, but in a latter situation can

the Court act in the same way?

Even though the law prescribed a minimum term of imprisonment

for an offence of rape committed on a girl less than 16 years of age,

commonly known as statutory rape, the Supreme Court held that

prescribing a mandatory minimum term of sentence amounts to

preventing the High Court from imposing a sentence that it feels is

appropriate in the exercise of its judicial discretion. (SC Reference No.

03/2008 decided on 15.10.2008) it was further held that;

The minimum mandatory sentence in section 364(2) (e) of the Penal

Code is in conflict with Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12(1) of the

Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited from

imposing a sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its

judicial discretion notwithstanding the minimum mandatory

sentence.

This decision has been approved again by the Supreme Court in the

case of Attorney General v. Ambagala Mudiyanselage Samantha SC

Appeal 17/2013 SC minutes 12.03.2015.

The circumstances in which the offence was committed in the

present case is also need consideration of imposing a non custodial term

of sentence. The Petitioner as well as the prosecutrix are happily married

and having their own family lives.

4

Under these circumstances, I set aside the custodial part in the

sentences imposed on 1 st 2nd and 3rd charges. The fines and the

compensation part of the sentence remain intact.

In addition to the fine and the compensation imposed on the 2nd

charge, I impose 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment suspended for 10 years.

I further direct the Learned High Court Judge to consider whether

it is necessary to grant time to pay the fine and the compensation.

P.R.Walgama J.

I agree.
