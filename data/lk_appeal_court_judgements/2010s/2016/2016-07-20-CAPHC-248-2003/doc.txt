P.R.Walgama, J

When this matter was taken up for argument

parties were absent and

Court concluded the case

unrepresented, nevertheless

as the parties and their

Registered Attorneys were duly informed of the date

fIxed for argument.

The Respondent - Appellants has lodged the instant

appeal against the order of the Learned High Court

Judge dated 21.10.2003. The Petitioner fIled a plaint

In terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, complaining of a forceful entry to the

paddy land In issue. It was the position of the

Petitioner that she was placed In possesslOn of the

said paddy land by an order of the District Court.

After an inquiry the Learned Magistrate delivered his

order on 18th November 1997, and handed over

the said paddy land to the Petitioner. Being

aggrieved by the said order the Respondents invoked

the revIslOnary jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court of Balapitiya to have the said order of the

Learned Magistrate set aside. Pursuan t to the said

application the Learned High Court Judge revised

the order of the Learned Magistrate and ordered a

fresh 1nqu1ry 1n to

Petitioner.

Thereupon a fresh

Learned Magistrate by

has observed thus;

the above

1nqu1ry was

his order

application of the

held

dated

and the

22.04.2002

That the Petitioner has not mentioned 1n the

application that there 1S a breach of the peace or

there 1S likely hood of a occurnng of the breach

of the peace. Therefore without establishing the fact

that there 1S a breach of the peace or there is a

likely hood of the same the Court cannot exercise its

jurisdiction to adjudicate on the said matter. The

said rationale was observed 1n the case of

VELUPILLAI .VS. SIVANANDAN- 1993 1 SLR - 123 and 1n

the case of PUNCHINONA .VS. PADUMASENA (1994) 2

SLR- 117.

Therefore the Learned Magistrate was of the V1ew

that the petitioner has failed to established to

satisfy the said requirement, for the Magistrate to

exerC1se the said jurisdiction.

Ir_ addition to the afore said the Learned Magistrate

has observed that the alleged dispute relates to a

dispute 1n respect of a paddy land and any

4

dispute arising in relation to a paddy land should

be resolved according to the provisions laid down in

the Agrarian Services Act and Agrarian Development

Act. (as observed in the case of MANSOOR .VS. OIC

A VISSA WELLA)

Hence in the above context the

application has been rejected accordingly.

Petitioner's

Being aggrieved by the said order

m.oved the High Court in revlslOn

the Petitioner has

to have the said

order of the Learned Magistrate said aside or vacate.

The Learned High Court Judge by her order dated

21.10.2003 has revised the order of the Learned

Magistrate and had allowed the application of the

Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said impugned order of the

Learned High Court Judge the Respondent - Appellant

has appealed to this Court to have the said order

vacated.

At the very outset it IS salient to note

order of the Learned Magistrate dated

that the

was on the basis that there IS no

information of a breach of the peace

alleged dispute IS in respect of a paddy

Thus In the above context this Court IS of the

VIew that the Learned High Court Judge has made

the impugned order without any proper basis, which

IS repugnant to the afore said statutory prOVISIOns.

In the teeth of the afore said this court is of the

VIew that the impugned order of the Learned High

Court Judge should be set aside forthwith and gIve
