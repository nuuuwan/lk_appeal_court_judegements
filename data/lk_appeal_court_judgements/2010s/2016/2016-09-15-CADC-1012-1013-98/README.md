DECIDED ON: 15.09.2016

P.R. Walgama. J.

The instant order concerns an application made by 6th

Defendant -Appellant seeking an order to re list this matter

for hearing.

The facts as tersely stated by the 6th Defendant- Appellant

are as follows;

The Petitioner was the 6th Defendant in case No.

1012/98/{f}.

The said case was abated due to the fact that Appellant

had failed to take necessary steps to substitute the 5th

Defendant, deceased. It IS stated by the 6th Defendant-

Petitioner- Appellant that due to his old age and non

corporation by Respondents that he could not obtain

necessary documents on time.

But it is submitted by the 6th Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant

that prior to the order of the abetment was made the

Appellant has filed the death certificate of the substituted

Plaintiff as 'WI and the her son's birth certificate as 'Wi'.

In addition the Appellant has also filed relevant documents

to substitute certain parties In place of the deceased.

Further it stated by the Appellant that as he could not

produce certified copies of the some relevant documents

court has dismissed the Appellant's application accordingly.

It is seen from the record that the Petitioner- Appellant has

taken necessary steps and tender all the documents

necessary for substitution.

Therefore in the above setting the 6th Defendant- Petitioner-

Appellant urged this court to have this matter re listed.

The 6th Defendant Appellant Petitioner preferred an appeal to

this court challenging the judgment in the case of DC.

Horana 2276/P, on the basis that no share has been

allotted to by the said judgment. As it was a partition

action the Appellant- Petitioner claims title by deeds and

through prescription.

After the afore said judgment many parties have deceased

and the Appellant was burdened with the task of

substituting theirs hairs accordingly.

Further it is stated by the Appellant- Petitioner that the

other respondents who were satisfied with the afore said

judgment has not helped him to obtain the necessary

documents to effect the substitution in respect of the

parties deceased.

The primary bone of contention of the 1st Defendant-

Respondent was that the Appellant -Petitioner has not acted

with due diligence. But it is seen from the case record that

the Appellant -Petitioner was encountered with the issue of

substituting parties in place of the deceased and had caused

tremendous hard---5hip to him.

The Appellant- Petitioner has adverted court to the case of

JUNADASA AND ANOTHER .VS. SAM SILVA AND OTHERS 1994

(1) SLR 232- has pronounced thus;

"since there is no legislation governing the matter under

what authority could the Court have ordered the re-listing

of the application? I think the Court had the Power the

..

restore the application to the list in the exercise of its

inherent jurisdiction"

Further In the case of SHANMUGAM .VS. THAMBIRAJAH -

Srikantha Law Reports digest Vol II page 163-has

recognised the power of the Court of Appeal to reinstate on

showing of sufficient cause.

Therefore it is the contention of the Appellant -Petitioner

as there were number of deaths occurred during this

period it was a difficult task to gather relevant information as

to the heirs of the deceased parties.

The Respondent in this case had also referred to a case

which has no nexus to the case in hand. In the case of

J I NADASA . VS. SAM 51 LVA 1994 1 SLR- 232

The above matter was mainly based on the absence of

Petitioner, and has held that the court cannot order the

reinstatement of an application and had dismissed, unless

sufficient cause for absence is alleged and established. It

cannot order reinstatement on compassionate grounds"

It IS further alleged by the Respondent that the

Appellant - Petitioner in his petition for relisting has not

make an application to vacate the initial order dated

27.01.2014, which abated the appeal. In the said backdrop

it is contended by the Respondent that the application to

relist the appeal should be dismissed.

But it is salient to note if this court decides to allow to

relist the appeal then automatically the order of abetment

will be vacated. Therefore this court should not be

trammelled by technicalities, which will cause a miscarriage

of justice to the Appellant -Petitioner.

In encapsulating the above factual and legal position this

court is satisfied with the diligence shown in prosecuting

the appeal.

Hence for the foregoing reason we allow the application

for relisting.

Application is allowed.
