This is a Revision Application filed by the Petitioner to set aside the

Order of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 21107114.

It is important to note that on perusal of the entirety of the petition and

affidavit, the petitioner has not prayed or averred warranting the intervention

of this Court by way of revisionary power. This Court would not entertain a

revision application, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Court

will exercise its revisionary powers if there are exceptional circumstances

such as, something illegal about the order made or when the application

discloses circumstances which shock the conscience of the Court

(Seelawathie vs. Agosthinu Appuhamy (2008) BLR 251).

It is significant to note that the Petitioner has not complained

anywhere in the petition or affidavit that the impugned order made by the

learned Trial Judge is illegal or that the Judge has improperly exercised the

discretion vested in him or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

Hence, no specific ground for revision has been stated in the Petition.

The Petitioner has only narrated the facts and nothing more.

3

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner has not

made out a case for the exercise of revisionary powers of this Court over the

impugned order.

As such the Revision Application under consideration stands refused.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree
