proceedings and lor an order staying the execution of the order dated 28/4/2015 made in

MC Kurunegala Case No. 79308/66 until the final determination of the present application.

The said application was supported on 23/5/2016 court thought it fit to grant the said

interim relief and issue notice on the 1 st and 2nd Complainants-Respondents-Respondents

returnable on 3115/2016. The 1 st and 2nd Respondents thereafter sought to have the matter

fixed for inquiry with regard to the extension of the said stay order. The 1 st and 2nd

Respondents did not however file limited objections setting out the grounds upon which

they object to the extension ofthe above said stay order.

On 17/6/2016 and 417/2016 both counsels were heard in support and in opposition of the

stay order. Thereafter parties agreed to file their written submissions in support of same. It

was submitted that the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner and the Respondents was

2

running a business in partnership under the name, style and firm of'Dias Motors, Engineers

and Sales' at the said premises in dispute and the petitioner's equipment on the premises

are of high value. Secondly the income from the said business is the primary income of

both petitioners. Further that the petitioners will suffer substantial and irreparable loss,

prejudice and hardship, and the final relief in this application will be rendered nugatory

and ineffective, unless the interim relief prayed for in the prayer (d) below is not granted.

"(d) Grant and issue an interim order in the first instance staying any further proceedings and lor

an order staying the execution of the order dated 281412015 made in MC Kurunegalla Case

No. 79308166 until the final determination of the present application; "

It was submitted that what is required is that for the petitioners to present a prima facia

case warranting a stay order. It was submitted that if the status quo is not maintained, and

the Appeal Court were to hold in favour of the Petitioners, the petitioners would suffer

grave and irremediable loss and damage and the final relief so granted would be rendered

nugatory and ineffective. Accordingly counsel for the 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-

Petitioner and the Intervenient-Petitioner-Petitioner respectfully moved court that the

foresaid interim order be extended until the final determination of the present application.

The counsel for the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent objecting to extension of the

issuance of the interim order submits that the 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner and the

Intervenient-Petitioner-Petitioner have not prayed that they be restored to possession.

Attention of Court has been drawn to the Supreme Court Judgment in Ramalingam v

Thangarajah 19822 SLR 693 where his Lordship Justice Sharvananda has set down the

obligation of the Primary Court judge under the provision of section 68(3) as follows,

"In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land, where a breach of peace is

threatened or is likely under part VII, of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the main point for

decision is the actual possession of the land on the date of the filling of the information under

3

!

f I! 1 !II

! Ii f

section 66; but, where forcible dispossession took place within two months before the date on

which the said information was filed the main point is. Actual possession prior to that alleged date

of dispossession. Section 68 is only concerned with the determination as to who was in possession

of the land or the part on the date of the filling of the information under section 66. It directs the

judge to declare that the person who was in such possession was entitled to possession of the land

or part thereof Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the judge can come to a definite finding

that some other party had been forcible dispossessed within a period of two months next

proceeding the date on which the information was filed under section 66. The effect of this sub-

section is that it enables a party to be treated to be in possession on the date of the filling of the

information though actually he may be found to have been dispossessed before that date provided

such dispossession took place within the period of two months next proceedings the date of the

filling of the information. It is only if such a party can be treated or deemed to be in possession on

the date of the filling of the information that the person actually in possession can be said not to

have been in possession on the date of the filling of the information. Thus, the duty of the judge in

proceedings under section 68 is to ascertain which party was or deemed to have been in possession

on the relevant date, namely, on the date of the filling of the information under section 66. Under

section 68 the judge is bound to maintain the possession of such person even if he be a rank

trespasser as ? against any interference even by the rightful owner. This section entitles even a

squatter to the protection of the law, unless his possession was acquired within two months of the

filling of the information. "

Attention of court has been kindly invited to the judgment of His Lordship Justice

Chithrasiri in Jeevantha Senarathna v Hon. Attorney General (CA(CHC) No

102/2001) where his Lordship has held that in terms of Section 68(3) of the said Act, it is

duty of the Primary Court Judge to make an order directing the party dispossessed be

restored to possession prohibiting all disturbances of such possession otherwise that is

under the authority of an order Ide cree of the competent court.

In the case of Duwearachchi v Vincent Perera 1984(2) SLR page 94 where this court has

laid down 3 principals which court should consider when they are called upon to consider

the issuance or non-issuance of a stay order. They are as follows,

(a) Will a final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is successful?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

(c) Will irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to either party?

(Vide Natwealth Security Ltd v The Monetary Board of Central bank & Others

CA(writ)application No 335/2015 )

This court has to limit the scope ofthis order only to the question whether the interim order

should be extended or not. The Learned Counsel for both parties has extensively addressed

this court.

It was urged by the Counsel of the 1 st Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner and Intervenient-

Petitioner-Petitioner that among the one of the exceptional circumstances setout was that

the Learned Magistrate has granted relief which the 1 st and 2nd Respondents have not

prayed for, any reliefs available in Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44

of 1979. Further that the 1 st and 2nd Petitioners have not been dispossessed the 1 st and 2nd

Respondents from the lands which are the subject of the purported disturbance ofthe peace;

and that the 1 st and 2nd Respondents have breached the equitable principal of uberrima

fidei; and have misrepresented facts to court; Further the 1 st and 2nd Petitioners will surfer

grave and irremediable loss and damage if a stay order as prayed for is not issued until the

final determination of the revision application. It was also urged that the Learned High

Court Judge of Kuru neg ala delivered his order dated 19-5-2016 refusing to extend and lor

issue a stay order until final determination ofPHC Kurunegala No HCRl49/2016.

The Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala by his order dated 19/5/2016 has held that,

i. The provincial High Court is vested with the power to revise and set aside the said

order of the Learned Additional Magistrate in terms of Article 154(3)(b) of the

constitution read with section 4 and 5 of the High Court of the Provinces (special

Provisions) Act No 19 of 1996;

ii. The duty to disclose exceptional circumstances is on the Petitioners;

iii. The Learned Additional Magistrate in the said order has held that the Respondents

should be restored into possession. The Petitioners have submitted that the

Respondents have not prayed to be restored into possession. A Magistrate has the

power in terms of Section 68(1), 68(2), 68(3) and 68(4) to restore any party

dispossessed back into possession of the land which is the subject of the dispute.

Therefore the argument of the petitioner that the Learned Magistrate has granted a

relief not prayed for cannot be accepted;

iv. The petitioners have also taken up the position that the respondent in their information

to court have not disclosed the fact that the respondents given the subject matter to the

]St petitioner and subsequently revoked the said gift and that by suppressing the said

fact the respondents have not acted in good faith. The Learned Magistrate has

considered the fact of the gift in his order and in any event the mere fact that the

respondents have suppressed the saidfact should not be a reason to refuse the reliefs

they have sought;

v. Considering all the above matters and the order of the Learned Magistrate there does

not appear to be prima facie case warranting the issuance of an order staying the

execution of the Learned Magistrate's Order and therefore the application for a stay

order is refused

We considered the above submissions of the Learned President Counsel and are off the

view that the final order will be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is successful. We find

that the Learned Magistrate has erred in ordering that the respondents be restored to

possession when there is no such prayer in the petition by the respondents. The respondents

had not prayed for restoration of possession this is a private information under Section

66(1 )(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in terms of Section 66( 1 )(b) and the

petitioner has to set out the relief sought.

In Surangi V. Rodrigo(2003) 3 SLR page 35 it was decided that" no court is entitled to

or has jurisdiction to grant relief to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the

plaint." The above principle has also been held in the Indian case of Krishna Priya Ganguly

V University ofLucknow (1984) AIR 186 fazal Alij stated that,

"Finally, in his own petition in the High Court, the respondent had merely prayed for a writ

directing the state or the college to consider his case for admission yet the High Court went a step

further and straightaway issued a writ of mandamus directing the college to admit him to the Us.

course and thus granted a relief to the respondent which he himself never prayed for and could

not have prayed for. Such a gross discrimination made in the case of a person who had obtained

lowest aggregate and lowest position seems to us to be extremely shocking. Although much could

be said against the view taken by the High Court yet we would not like to say more than this that

the High Court had made a very arbitrary, casual and laconic approach to the case and based its

judgment purely on speculation and conjectures ... "

It was submitted that the Magistrate had gravely by erred in ordering restoration of the

respondents to possession when there is no proof of forcible dispossession and there is no

prayer for restoration of possession. It was also submitted that the Magistrate should

however proceed with great caution where there is no Police report and only material before

him are statements of interested person. We find that there has been no forcible

dispossession. The Kurunegala Police has not though it fit to file information to court since

after it's investigating it has not found that there has been a breach of the peace or a

likelihood of the breach of the peace. We hold that the petitioners had made a prima facia

case and the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners we are of the view that

there would be irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to both parties since

this is a family dispute between the parents and the elder son.

We find that the Respondents had no knowledge that the property gifted to him by deed

has been revoked by his parents. However we are of the view that since this is a running

business of the said premises in dispute that there is a likelihood of the breach of peace. As

such we extend the stay order until the final determination of these proceedings.
