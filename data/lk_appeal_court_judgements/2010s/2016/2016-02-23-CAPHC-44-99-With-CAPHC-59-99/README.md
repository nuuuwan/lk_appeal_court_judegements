P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal ralses a short point In relation

to the Certificate filed by the Com plaina">1 t ,.,..., terms -..A.J..

of Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund

Act No. 15 of 1958, seeking to recover a sum of

Rs. 1,901,302.13 as E.P.F. Contributions and surcharge

due from Translanka Investment limited, where the

4th Respondent - Petitioner was a Director in the said

Company.

By the document marked PI, the Complainant-

Respondent instituted action In the Magistrate Court

Fort,

Section

38(2)

Directors

of the

of the said

above Act,

Company

for the

recovery of the said money as the EPF contribution

by the Employees and the surcharge thereto.

In a very summary term the 4 th Respondent-

Petitioner- Appellant had raised a preliminary 1ssue as

to the legality of the Certificate filed by the

Complainant- Respondent, as the said certificate lacks

certain particulars which should be containc:d therein.

The Learned Magistrate 1n dealing with the above

1ssue, 1n the impugned order has adverted to the

case of CITY CARRIES .VS ATTORNEY GENERAL-

1992 (2)- SLR 257. And was of the view that Section

38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, it 1S

only mandatory to mention 1n the said Certificate

the amount due to the Employees, and 1n addition

to the afore said detail the above Section does not

requ1re any other particulars to be included In the

said certificate. But In the instant matter the

Complainant has gIven more particulars about the

number of the employees, Contribution made by the

Employer, Contribution made by the Employee, and

the relevant period that the payment

and the surcharge payable In terms

of the above Act.

was defaulted,

of Section 16

It was also the position of the Respondent-

Petitioner - Appellant that the said Company is not a

gmng concern and the assets belong to the

Company are under the control of the Central Bank.

Nevertheless the Learned Magistrate has held that

the Directors of the said Company are liable to pay

the amount as EPF and the surcharged thereto.

Being aggrieved by the said the 4th Respondent -

Petitioner - Appellant has come by way reVISlOn to

the High Court seeking to set aside the said order.

The Learned High Court Judge In dealing with the

vital Issue raised therein has drawn his attention to

the facts stated by the Counsel for the Respondent,

In that it IS stated that the above certificate was

filed In respect of all

employees of the said

that the Complainant

a

schedule containing names, E.P.F. numbers, remuneration,

and E.T.F. contribution was filed in the Magistrate's

Court and before the Commissioner of Labour.

Therefore it IS contended by the Respondent that

the Petitioner cannot claim to be unaware of the

particulars of the employees.

In the above setting the Learned High

has held that the said impugned certificate has

been filed In respect of all the employees of the

said Company and was of the VIew that the alleged

Certificate is in conformity with the Section 38(2) of

the above Act. Further the Learned High Court

Judge has also referred to the case of AMEER

LABOUR- and was of the VIew that the above case

differ from the case In hand as the Certificate In

the said case IS only In respect of two employees

whose names are not disclosed in the Certificate.

It IS further noted that the 4th Respondent -

said Company

ceased to hold

Petitioner was a Director of the

during the relevant period, and had

office thereafter.

The Petitioner - Appellant contends that, as he is not

a Director in the Company at present he coulu nOl

be liable under the above Section 38(2) of the said

Act.

In the above setting the Learned High Court Judge

held as the Respondent - Petitioner was a Director

during the relevant period and as such he is liable

to pay the sum due as the EPF and the

surcharge thereto.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the said High

Court Judge the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant has

appealed to this Court on the following grounds;

That the 4th Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant was

one time a Director of the said Company but

ceased to be a Director with effect from 05.12.1994.

The categorical position of the Petitioner - Appellant IS

that in terms of Section 40 of the above Act, it IS

the present Directors of the Company who can be

deemed guilty of an

the above Act.

40 nf .~ ..

In response to the above Issue the Complainant-

Respondent had adverted to the judgment of

CA(PHC)-APN-65/2009 - wherein Their Lordships have

held that the Directors who held office during the

relevant period are be liable, to pay the amount as

E.P.F.

In dealing with the above issue Their Lordships had

cognIzance of the Section 40 of the Employees

Provident Fund Act, and stated thus;

"where an offence under the said Act IS committed

by a body of persons then if such body of

persons IS a body corporate shall be deemed to be

guilty of the offence. Therefore it is clear that apart

from the recovery procedure set out In Section

17 ,38( 1), and 38(2) of the said Act as amended, the

Commissioner has to institute a separate action In

the relevant Magistrate Court to punished the

employer who has defaulted."(emphasis added)

Hence In the said back drop it was held In the

above case it IS the Directors who held office

during the relevant period will be, liable to pay the

amount stated in the Certificate.

It is also

Therefore this Court IS of the VIew that the

to the Petitioner to defend his case.

The Respondents had reiterated the case of CITY

CARRIERS LIMITED .VS. COMMISSIONER OF LABOUR-

1992 2 SLR - 257 and has stressed the fact that in

the above case, Their Lordships had observed that

the following particulars should contained In the

certificate.

1. The period for which the sum is due

2. The computation of the sum and

3. The number of employees concerned In making

the computation.
