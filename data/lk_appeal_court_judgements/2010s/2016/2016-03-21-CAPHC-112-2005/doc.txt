the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 30.07.2003 and the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 02.02.2005.

The facts germane to the above appeal are as

follows;

The Officer In Charge of Ratnapura Police has

of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of

1979 In the Magistrate Court of Ratnapura of a

The said information was filed pursuant to a

complaint made by the 1st Party Respondent

alleging that the 2nd Party Petitioner has made

arrangemen t to carry out mining activities in

the disputed land which belongs to their

father.

But it IS noted that he has never stated

that he also have right to the subject land.

The 2nd Party - Appellant IS the brother of the

1 st Party Respondent and it IS stated that he

had possessed the land for 17 years and the

1 st Respondent cannot be allowed to possess the

land all by him.

The Learned Magistrate has observed the following

in the said impugned order;

That the 1st Party - Respondent has a deed in

his favour to the land in issue and the 2nd Party

- Petitioner has forcibly entered the disputed

land and had started mining in the land.

The 1st Part - Respondent has tendered the title

deed bearing NO.2621 and the affidavits from

the father and from

IV5 and IV6.

It vvas the stance

that he was in

the brothers and sister as

of the 2nd Party -Appellant

possesslOn of this land well

over 17 years and with the consent

father he had in fact plucked coconuts, and also

had been mining gems in the subject land.

The Learned High Court Judge has considered

the affidavits tendered by both parties and was of

the View that the said documents has

established the possesslOn of the party -

Respondent to the land in suit, and had placed

the Respondent in possesslOn of the afore said

land.

Being aggrieved by the said order the 2nd party

- Petitioner - Appellant has lodged a reVlSlOn

application in the High Court of Ratnapura to have

the said order set aside.

The Learned High Court Judge in handing out

the impugned order was of the View that the

Learned Magistrate has arrived at the correct

finding in the above circumstances and therefore

has held that the Learned Magistrate has not

flawed in the factual and legal matrix in the

above determination.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the

Learned High Court Judge, the 2nd Party - Petitioner

- Appellant made the instant application by way

In the written submissions tendered by the

counsel for the Respondent has reiterated the fact

that the Learned Magistrate has considered the

affidavits tendered by the Respondent, being the

affidavits by the father and the siblings which

are of a probative value and had gIVen more

weight to the material emerged from said

affidavit.

The Respondent

fact that the

has also adverted court to the

Appellant's allegation that the

Respondent has

Section 66 (l)(a) of the

Act No. 44 of 1979.

Primary

complaint to the

dispossession and

been filed under

Court Procedure

But it IS apparent from the complaint made by

the 1 st Respondent - Respondent that the Petitioner

has entered disputed land forcibly with a group of

persons for the purpose of mining. Therefore it

IS abundantly clear that a land dispute has

occurred and there IS a breach of the peace

or likely hood of a breach of the peace.

In the above setting this Court is of the view that

there IS no merit in the position taken by the

Petitioner - Appellant as to the issue of dispossession

as it IS clear from the statement made by the

Respondent that the Petitioner - Appellant and a

5

group of persons has forcibly entered the disputed

land for the purpose of mining.

Pursuant to the complaint made by the Respondent

of the above situation the Officer In Charge of

Ratnapura Police has filed the information Report In

the Magistrate Court In terms of Section 66(1)(a) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

The Respondent has adverted court to the case of

RA!vlALINGAM .VS. THANGARAJAH (1932) 2 SLR 693-

which has express thus;

"that a judge should in an inquiry under Section 66

confine himself to the question of actual possesslOn

on the date of filing information except In a case

where a person who had been In possesslOn of land

had been dispossessed within a period

of two months immediately preceding filing of

information" .

Therefore In the said backdrop it IS abundantly

clear that the Learned Magistrate has made the said

order In the correct perspective which warran ts no

interference from this court.

It is also salient to note that the affidavit tendered

by the surveyor which confirms the posseSSlOn of

the Respondent in the land in suit.

6

The above circumstances, In my oplnlOn, form a

complete chain and lead to an irresistible

conclusion that the Petitioner - Appellant's application

to reVlse the orders of the Learned High Court

Judge and the order of the Learned Magistrate 1S

devoid of merits and should stand dismissed.

Accordingly application 1S dismissed subject to a
