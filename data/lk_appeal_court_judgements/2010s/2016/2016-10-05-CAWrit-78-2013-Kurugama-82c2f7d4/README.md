However as revealed before us, the 2nd Respondent by his letter dated 15.03.2012 (two months

after his recommendation to the 9th Respondent) informed the Petitioner, that due to certain

complaints received against him in the nature of ,

1. The Petitioner has failed to be present at his office during working hours

2. The Petitioner has failed to manage his employees properly

3. The Petitioner has treated external parties who are working with the 1st Respondent

Authority in an unnecessary and unethical manner

4. The Petitioner has failed to maintain proper administration and supervision in respect

of development activities and he has failed to adhere to the relevant circulars of the

Government and the 1st Respondent Authority

that he has been transferred to the office of the District Director of Matara as a project co-

ordinator.

It was further informed by the said letter that a preliminary investigation being conducted by the

11 th Respondent on the said complaints. By another letter he received from the 11th Respondent

dated 16.03.2012 the acting allowance paid to him was suspended with immediate effect. The

Petitioner has thereafter reported to Matara Office on 22.03.2012 to his substantive post.

The Petitioner was summoned for the said preliminary investigation on two occasions and his

statement was recorded. Subsequent to the recording of the statement of the Petitioner he has

received a letter dated 14.06.2012 from the 9th Respondent informing the Petitioner that,

a) The 11th Respondent has completed the preliminary investigation and forwarded the

said report to the meeting of the Board of Directors which was held on 14.06.2012.

b) Mter considering the said report which was forwarded by the 9th Respondent, it was

decided by the Board of Directors to conduct a further investigation regarding the

said allegations.

c) The 2nd, 9th, 10th and 11th Respondents were appointed as the investigation committee.

d) The said investigation would be held on 21.06.2012 at the Head Office of the 15t

Respondent Authority and the Petitioner was requested to attend the said inquiry with

the documentary evidence to be submitted to the investigation committee.

The investigation referred to above had been conducted as scheduled and according to the

Petitioner, six officers along with the Petitioner were summoned for the said inquiry and the

attendance was signed. Even though six officers were summoned, only five officers were

present.

The 11th Respondent, was asked by the 2nd Respondent to explain the allegations against the five

officers present and thereafter two officers from the internal audit division submitted certain

documentation in order to substantiate the allegations and the Petitioner and the four others

denied the allegations against them, with documentation to support their version.

However as submitted by the Petitioner, no charges were framed against them or read out to

them at the said inquiry and the inquiry was lasted for about two hours.

On 05.07.2012 the 2nd Respondent had issued a letter to the Petitioner and by the said letter the

Petitioner was informed that, according to the audit report dated 23.05.2012 prepared by the 9th

Respondent and submitted to the Director Board on 14.06.2012 through the 2nd Respondent,

a) Five charges in respect of distributing banana plants in the Hambantota District under

plants

were made against the Petitioner and a committee comprising of 2nd, 9th and 10th

Respondents having conducted an inquiry on 21.06.2012 by summoning the relevant officers

before them had found the Petitioner guilty of all the charges and decided to,

1. Removal of the Petitioner from his acting appointment and confirm him in the post of

project co-ordinator

ii. Defer the next two salary increments of the Petitioner

As observed by this court the document P-6 refers to 11 charges against the petitioner and after

the said investigation/ inquiry the Petitioner was found guilty of all the said charges. However

the position taken up by the Petitioner, right throughout this case was that, the Petitioner was

neither served or informed of any charges prior to the said investigation/inquiry nor a proper

disciplinary inquiry held against him.

In this regard the Respondents have drawn the attention of this court to the section 7 of the

Administrative Code of the 1st Respondent Authority where it is provided for a Summary

Procedure to conduct a disciplinary inquiry. Whilst relying on the provisions of the said section,

the Respondents took up the position that the inquiry referred to in P-6 was conducted under

section 7 of the Administrative Code.

According to section 7 of the Administrative Code of the 1st Respondent a summary inquiry will

be held against an employee, when that employee was found responsible with clear evidence for

committing minor offence after a preliminary investigation.

Under section 7.2 there is duty on the officer who conducted the summary inquiry to explain the

charges to the employee. Under the same Administrative Code minor offence is identified as an

offence where dismissal or a fine up to three days salary is not warranted and schedule (b) to

section 4 of the said Code identifies some of the minor offences as,

,!

a) Failure to report to work without valid reason I b) Getting late to report to work without valid reason

c) Causing damage to property by negligent Act

d) Work slow or work without due attention

e) Sleep during office hours

1) Disrespect to public

g) Falsely pretending as sick during office hours

Section 14.2 of the Administrative Code further provides that, when imposing a sentence for

committing a minor offence, more than one punishment cannot be imposed. For example a

warning and a fine cannot be imposed together and it should be only one punishment.

However when considering the letter dated 15.03.2012 which was issued at the time the

Petitioner was transferred to Matara to his substantive post, we observe that the allegations

leveled against the Petitioners were coming under the schedule (b) of the section 4 but, the

charges under which the summary proceedings were carried out as referred to in P-6 does not

come under any of the minor offences identified under schedule (b) to section 4 of the

Administrative Code.

When considering the above provisions of the Administrative Code of the 1st Respondent this

court cannot agree with the arguments raised by the Respondents that the disciplinary inquiry

referred to above was conducted under the summary procedure identified in the Administrative

Code of the 1st Respondent Authority.

According to P-5 a committee comprising of 4 members including the 2nd,9t\ 10th and 11th

Respondents were nominated to hold the investigation by the Board of Directors but according to

P-6 the committee which considered the material against the Petitioner comprised only three

members including 2nd ,9th ,and 10th Respondents and the 11th Respondent was summoned as a

9

witness before the said committee. In these circumstances it is further observed that there wasn't

a proper appointment to the committee to investigate the irregularities committed by the

Petitioner.

The Respondents have further argued that, the Petitioner is estopped from objecting to the

procedure followed in conducting the inquiry for the reasons, that

a) The procedure followed is provided under section 7 of the Administrative Code

b) Petitioner had consented for the conduct of the said inquiry by signing the attendance

on that day

However this court cannot agree with the said argument raised on behalf of the Respondent for

the reason that,

a) The procedure followed by the Respondents in conducting the disciplinary inquiry is

contrary to the provisions of the Administrative Code of the 15t Respondent.

b) Even if there was consent, (Petitioner has challenged this position) a consent given to

an illegal procedure to follow, cannot be considered as true consent.

When going through the procedure followed by the Respondents in conducting the disciplinary

inquiry against the Petitioner this court further observes that, the Respondents have failed to hold

a proper disciplinary inquiry by

a) Informing the charges against the Petitioner

b) Giving an opportunity to get ready for the inquiry

c) Place the evidence against the Petitioner when he is present before the inquiry and

giving him an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses

d) Give an opportunity to place his evidence before the inquiry

e) The charges said to have been considered at the inquiry were not the charges

informed to the Petitioner when his acting appointment was removed and transferred

to a different district and thereby he was misled of the charges against him

and thereby failed to follow the principles of Natural Justice when conducting the said

mquuy.

It is observed by Mallick, that "Natural Justice" requires that persons liable to be directed by acts

decision, or proceedings of any authority be given adequate notice of what is proposed- so that

they may be in a position to make a representation on their behalf, to appear at hearing and

enquiry and effectively prepare their own case and answer the case. Writs Law and Practice

M.R. Mallick at page 757.

In the case of Trianbak Pati Tripathi Vs, B.H.SJ. Education Allahabad AIR 1973 AIl 1 it was

held that, "one of the essential principles of Natural Justice is that the persons whose rights are to

be affected must be given notice of the case or the charges which he has to meet."

In the case of Sevaragen V. Race Relation Board [1976] 1 AIl ER 12 (CA) Lord Denning M.R.

has held that, "the fundamental rule is that if a person be sUbjected to pains or penalties, or

exposed to perverse proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some other way

adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be informed the case against

him and be afforded fair opportunity of answering it."

In the case of Nanaykkara V. University of Peradeniya (1985) 1 Sri LR 174 it was held that,

"the right to a fair hearing is a rule of universal application and in case of administrative acts or

decisions affecting the rights the duty to afford it is a duty lying upon everyone who decide

anything. "

11

When considering the material already discussed above it is clear that the Respondents have

acted in violation of rules of Natural Justice when conducting the disciplinary inquiry as referred

to in P-5 and imposing a punishment to the petition as revealed in P-6.

This court is further mindful of the fact that, even at the time the petitioner was transferred to

Matara by letter dated 15.03.2012 his substantive post was project co-ordinator but was only

acting as District Director. This court is unaware of the qualifications required to be appointed to

the post of District Director. An acting appointment is made on service requirements and in the

said circumstances petitioner is not entitled as of right to be appointed as an acting Director of

the 1 sl respondent Authority.

In the said circumstances this court concludes that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief claimed

in paragraphs (h) and (i) of his petition and therefore make order granting the relief prayed for in

paragraphs (h) and (i) of the Petition with cost to be paid to the Petitioner fixed at 10,000/-.

However I am not inclined to grant relief as prayed in paragraph G) and (k) to the petition.
