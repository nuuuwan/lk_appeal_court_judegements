L. T.B. Dehideniya J.

The 1 st Accused Appellant (the 1 st Appellant) and the deceased 2nd Accused

Appellant were charged before the Magistrate Court of Hambanthota on charges

punishable under section 454 and 457/459 of the Penal Code. Both accused

pleaded not guilty to the charges the trial began with the evidence of the 1 st

witness, the party aggrieved, the deceased Petitioner Respondent. After conclusion

of her evidence, both accused withdrew the former plea and tendered an

unconditional plea of guilt, and thereafter, the case was adjourned for the

identification and sentence. On the next date, the accused made an application to

withdraw the former plea and to plead not guilty to the charges. After an inquiry,

the learned Magistrate allowed the application. Being aggrieved by the said order,

the aggrieved party, the deceased Petitioner Respondent presented a revision

application to the High Court of Hambanthotha where the Learned High Court

Judge allowed the revision application and set aside the order of the learned

Magistrate allowing the application to withdraw the plea of guilty. Being

aggrieved by the said order, the 1 st Appellant and the deceased 2nd Accused

Appellant tendered this appeal.

This being a criminal appeal, the Court made an order on 25.06.12 that it is

not necessary to substitute heirs in place of 2nd deceased Accused Appellant. The

Petitioner Respondent, the aggrieved party, is also demised and the parties agreed

2

that it is not necessary to substitute on her behalf too on 25.02.2014. As such, the

case was taken up for argument.

thus;

Section 183 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code Act of 15 of 1979 read

183. (1) If the accused upon being asked if he has any cause to show why

he should not be convicted makes a statement which amounts to an

unqualified admission that he is guilty of the offence of which he is accused,

his statement shall be recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by

him; and the Magistrate shall record a verdict of guilty and pass sentence

upon him according to law and shall record such sentence:

Provided that the accused may with the leave of the Magistrate withdraw

his plea of guilt at any time before sentence is passed upon him, and in that

event the Magistrate shall proceed to trial as if a conviction has not been

entered

With the enactment of this Act, the Legislature has given authority to the

Magistrate to allow an accused to withdraw a plea of guilt "with the leave of the

Magistrate". The law prior to the Act was that that there was no express provision

regarding the withdrawal of a plea of guilty in written law. The issue regulated by

the Judge made law. The section 188 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code

Ordinance is that;

188. (1) If the accused upon being asked if he has any cause to show why he

should not be convicted makes a statement which amounts to an unqualified

admission that he is guilty of the offence of which he is accused, his

statement shall be recorded as nearly as possible in the words used by him;

and the Magistrate shall record a verdict of guilty and pass sentence upon

him according to law and shall record such sentence.

The proviso to section 183(1) which is included in the Act No. 15 of 1979

was there in the section 188 (1) of the Ordinance No. 15 of 1898 which was in

3

operation from 1 st March 1899 until the enactment of the Administration of

Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, which was also silent on the withdrawal of a plea of

guilt. The authorities governing the principal of withdrawal of a plea of guilt

decided prior to the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979

has to be applied while considering of the change of the law.

The Learned High Court Judge referred to the case of Pandiyan v.

Sugsthapala BALR 1984 Vol. 1 part iv page 148 where Abdul Carder J. referred to

John v. Charles 54 NLR 20 and has come to the conclusion that the order of the

learned Magistrate is not in accordance with the judgment of the John v. Charles

(supra) and as per Pandiyan v. Sugsthapala (supra) the same Magistrate who

recorded the plea of guilt must consider the application to withdraw the plea of

guilty.

John v. Charles (supra) was a case decided on 1st of April 1952 which was prior to the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No 15 of 1979 when there was no express provision to withdraw the plea of guilt. In that case it was held that;

"In my opinion an accused person has no right to withdraw a plea of guilt once tendered If he has, through misapprehension or under inducement or threat, tendered a plea of guilty and the Magistrate has not recorded a verdict of guilty, the accused may be permitted by the Magistrate, if he is satisfied that the original plea was not an unqualified admission of guilt, to withdraw it. If the Magistrate has, in fact, recorded a verdict of guilty he has no jurisdiction to vacate it. In such a case if, in truth, the plea was tendered through misapprehension or under inducement or threat, the accused will have to seek his remedy by way of revision. "

This decision is entirely based on the footing that the Magistrate has no

jurisdiction to allow an accused person to withdraw a plea <.>f guilty tendered by

him. The law has been changed and now the magistrate is vested with the power to

allow such an application on his discretion.

In the case of Pandiyan v. Sugsthapala (supra) the Court has considered the

change of the law and held that the proviso to section 183 (1) of the Criminal

4

Procedure Code Act was introduced to meet this situation. At page 24 it was held

that;

I take the view that the proviso to Section 183 (J) has been introduced to

meet this situation, but that has not taken away the discretion of the

Magistrate to, grant or not to grant leave. If the accused could, withdraw

his plea without any qualification what so ever, the proviso would have then

read that the accused may withdraw his plea of guilt at any time without the

phrase "with the leave of the Magistrate". The proviso as it now stands

requires the Magistrate to exercise his discretion.

The Legislature enacted the proviso to section 183 (1) with the intention of

allowing an accused person an opportunity to withdraw his unqualified plea of

guilty, but has vested the discretion with the Magistrate by inserting the words

"with the leave of the Magistrate". The legislature has not imposed any other

restriction on the Magistrate. In such a situation can a higher Court impose

conditions on a lower Court? The higher Court can set guide lines for the lower

Court to consider how the discretion should be exercised.

Learned Counsel for the 1 st Appellant drew our attention to the case of R. J.

Daryanani v. Eastern Silk Emporium Ltd. 64 NLR 529 where the discretion under

section 93 of the Civil Procedure Code has been considered. It has been held in

page 539 that;

Unless the Legislature has passed laws limiting the exercise of this power

either directly or by Rules or Orders having the force of law, the Courts

have no power to lay down rigid and inflexible rules for the exercise of a

judicial discretion. The normally accepted rules or principles for the

exercise of such a discretion, enunciated by the Courts of the highest

authority, are therefore only meant for the practical guidance of other

Courts. They do not have the force of law. In that sense, I hold that the

statement of the learned Chief Justice laying down what may appear to be

5

rules for the exercise of the discretionary power of the Courts under section

93, are not rules of law binding on our Courts. We are, therefore, free in

this case to consider if there are good reasons to set aside the exercise of

the discretion by the learned trial judge who allowed the amendment.

The Learned Counsel for the deceased Petitioner Respondent referred to

some Indian authorities and argue that the discretion of Court must be exercised

according to well established judicial principles, according to reasons, and fair

play and not according to whim and caprice. I am in total agreement with this

argument, but when the exercise of the discretion of a lower Court is considered

by a higher Court, it regulated by well established principles. It has been held in

the case ofWijewardane v. Lenora 60 NLR 457 at 463 that;

The mode of approach of an appellate Court to an appeal against an exercise of discretion is regulated by well established principles. It is not enough that the Judges composing the appellate Court consider that, if they had been in the position of the trial Judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. It must appear that the Judge has acted illegally, arbitrarily or upon a wrong principle of law or allowed extraneous or irrelevant considerations to guide or affect him, or that he has mistaken the facts, or not taken into account some material consideration. Then only can his determination be reviewed by the appellate Court.

I will set down the chronological events of the case with the relevant dates.

The accused were surrendered to Court on 17.09.1999 by an Attorney at Law. The

charges were read over only on 24.11.2004, which was after five years where both

accused pleaded not guilty to the charges. The case first fixed for trial on

18.05.2005, a part of first witness's evidence was recorded on 25.01.2006, and her

evidence was concluded on 32.08.2006. Thereafter, the case could not take up for

several days. On 06.03.2008, the both accused withdrew the former plea and

pleaded guilty to the charges. Even on that date, there was no return to the

summons issued to the 2 and 3 witnesses.

6

The Counsel for the accused appeared in the Magistrate Court submitted

that the accused (withdrew the former plea of not guilty and) pleaded guilty to

avoid the long delay and to conclude the case early. I do not blame the Court for

the delay, there were reasons, but when it is looked from the accuseds' point of

view, there was a considerable delay. The Counsel further submitted that the

accused were not well on that day. The learned Magistrate, in his order says that

he considered the submissions made by the Counsel. That means that the reasons,

led the accused to plead guilty, has been considered by the learned Magistrate. He

allowed the application as he has the jurisdiction to exercise the discretion when

the application is made prior to the sentence. One cannot say that the learned

Magistrate acted unreasonably, arbitrary, or illegally. He exercised his discretion

judicially. It need not be revived by Appellate Court.

Accordingly, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

12.05.2009 and direct the learned Magistrate to proceed as per the order of the

learned Magistrate of Hambanthotha dated 12.03.2008.

I do not order cost as the Petitioner Respondent is not among living.
