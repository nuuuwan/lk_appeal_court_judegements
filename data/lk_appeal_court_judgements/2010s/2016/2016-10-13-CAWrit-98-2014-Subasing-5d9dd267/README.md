and/or 11th Respondents to implement the circulars P-1, P-2 and P-4 in the Provincial

Public Service of the Sabaragamuwa Province and thereby place/promote the 1st _13th and

15th _21st Petitioners and the husband of the 14th Petitioner namely Ranpatige Piyasena in

their respective class in the Middle Level Technical Service and Sri Lanka Technical

Service.

C. grant a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and lor 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th _9th and/or 10th

and/or 11th Respondents to implement the circulars P-1, P-2 and P-4 in the Provincial

Public Service the Sabaragamuwa Province and direct the 1st_13th and 15th_21st Petitioners

and the husband of the 14th Respondent namely Ranpatige Piyasena be paid back wages

from October 2002 to the date of retirement of the respective petitioner.

As admitted by both parties before this court the 20 Petitioners and the husband of the 14th

Petitioner namely Ranpatige Piyasena recruited to the Health Department as Public Health Field

Assistants on casual basis attached to the Malaria Prevention Campaign.

As revealed before this court they were recruited to the above posts between 10.03.1970-

29.09.1985.

In 1977 the Middle Level Technical Service was created and established by circular 237 which is

produced by both parties before this court marked P-4A and R-1.

The Public Health Field Assistants were also absorbed to the Meddle Level Technical Service

backdating their service period initially to 01.09.1992 and subsequently to 02.08.1989 and finally

to 01.05.1977. As revealed from the document P-4 /R-2 the final back dating was approved by

the Cabinet on 09.10.2002 subject to several Government Circulars which were in operation

since 25.05.1977 to 30.11.1990.

However with the establishment of the Provincial Councils, a Provincial Public Service came in

to operation and the Petitioners, who were from Sabaragamuwa Province, opted to be attached to

the Provincial Public Service of the Sabaragamuwa Province. As revealed before this court, at

the time the Petitioners including the husband of the 14th Petitioner opted to be attached to the

Provincial Public Service of Sabaragamuwa Province they were still holding their substantive

position in Public Health Field Assistants but the Petitioners were silent whether their services

were made permanent at that time. The issue of making the Petitioners permanent in their

4

substantive position was raised during the argument before this court but the Petitioners failed to

give any explanation in this regard.

During the same period, the Middle Level Technical Service was re-structured as Sri Lanka

Technical Service which came into operation on 01.07.1994. The relevant circulars with regard

to the re-structuring are produced before us marked P-1 and P-2. The said circulars had made

provisions to absorb the officers already in the Middle Level Technical Service to the new

service "Sri Lanka Technical Service"

Whilst referring to the circular P-4 (R-2) by which the Public Health Field Assistants were

absorbed in to the Middle Level Technical Service, Petitioners have submitted before the court

that the 1st to 13th Petitioners and the husband of the 14th Petitioner were entitled to be in class 1

of the Middle Level Technical Service and 15th to 21st Petitioners were entitled to be in class

ll-A in the Middle Level Technical Service at the time the Middle Level Technical Service was

re-structured and therefore they were entitled to be appointed to the corresponding position in the

Sri Lanka Technical Service.

In this regard the Petitioners have relied on a chart they have prepared to explain the promotions

they were entitled from their date of appointment. (This chart is produced at page 10 of the

petition under paragraph 17)

As observed above, the question of the Petitioners' appointment to permanent carder is essential

to consider the correctness of the above position taken by them.

However in the said chart the Petitioners have considered their date of appointment to the

Malaria Prevention Campaign as the date of appointment to the permanent carder when

calculating promotions but, the Petitioners have initially accepted the position that their

appointment as Public Health Field Assistant in the Malaria Prevention Campaign was made on

casual basis.

5

Even though the Petitioners were silent on their permanent appointment, the Respondents have

taken up the following position before this court;

According to the Respondents, on 26th October 2009 the Minister in Charge of the subject of

Health in the Central Government had forwarded a Cabinet paper, to consider the casual

employment period of the Public Health Field Assistants from 01.05.1977 to 02.08.1989 as

confirmed without payment of any back wages and conferring such officers their entitlement for

any promotion as per P-4.

However as submitted by the Respondents the said Cabinet Paper was not approved by the

Cabinet but later submitted before the Ministry of Finance and Planning in the year 2011 but the

said memorandum was turned down on the basis that the said proposal if conceded would

tantamount to establishing a bad precedent in the Public Service (Documents R-4-R-6).

As observed by this court the Cabinet paper referred to above, which was produced marked R-4

had an annexure and in the said annexure produced marked R-4A there were 537 names

appeared. When the Respondent submitted the above position before this court, the Learned

Counsel for the Petitioners whilst challenging the said document took up the position that except

for two Petitioners, names of the other Petitioners were not found in R-4A but still the Petitioners

have failed to explain the correct position of their employment before this court.

The Petitioners have further relied on a letter issued by the Secretary to the Provincial Health

Ministry of the Sabaragamuwa Province which was produced before us marked P-ll. As

observed by this court the said letter was issued subsequent to a meeting the Petitioners had with

the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province confirming the decisions reached at the said

meeting. Even though no specific references were given to the relevant circulars by the said letter

a decision had been reached to give promotions to all the retired public Health Field Assistants

subject to two conditions namely, the said promotions are personal to them, and the said

6

promotions will not become a precedent in future. Even though the said letter refers to the term

promotion, in the body of the letter, refers to the absorption of the Public Health Field Assistants

to the Middle Level Technical Service, and therefore it is understood that what is ment by

promotion in the said letter was in fact not promotions but absorption to the said service. When

the said decision was conveyed to the relevant authorities, the said authorities had faced

difficulties in implementing the said decision without having carder provisions to make those

appointments.

However as revealed before us from the documents forwarded by both parties, the said decision

was re-considered by the Provincial Council after receiving instructions from the Ministry of

Finance of the Central Government. It was brought to our notice of a decision conveyed to the

Chief Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council by the Director General, Department of

Management Services of the Central Government which is produced marked R-14 informing

that, there is no provision to create new or supernumerary positions for retired Government

Servants.

When considering the material revealed before this court, this court is mindful of the following

decisions taken by the authorities.

a) When the Minister in Charge of the Health in the Central Government forwarded a

cabinet paper to consider the casual employment period of the Public Health Field

Assistants from 01.05.1977 to 02.08.1989 as confirmed without back wages, the said

memorandum was turned down on the basis that the said proposal if conceded would

tantamount to establishing bad precedent in the Public Service.

b) When the Petitioners met the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province a decision was

reached to give promotions to all retired Public Health Field Assistants subject to two

conditions namely,

7

1. The said promotions will be personal to them

11. The said promotions will not be a precedent in future

c) When the said decision was communicated to the Department of Management Service of

the Central Government, the Director General -Management Services advised the

Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council that, there is no provision to create new or

supernumerary positions for retired Government Servants.

The Petitioners to the present application are seeking a writ of Mandamus to compel the

Respondents to implement circulars produced before this court marked P-l, P-2 and P-4. The

Petitioners have further taken up the position that they had a legitimate expectation to enter

in to the Middle Level Technical Service and from the said service to the Sri Lanka

Technical Service when the said circulars were issued by the relevant authorities and they

had a legal right to be appointed to the said service.

However as observed in (a) and (c) above, the court observed the fact that the authorities

have found out that, it is impossible to implement the said circulars and any attempt to

implement the said circulars would tantamount to bad precedent in the Public Service.

When the Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province made an attempt to implement the

circulars subject to two conditions referred to above, that too could not implement since it

was impossible to implement the said agreement.

In this regard this court is mindful of the decision in the case of Wannigama V. The

Incorporated Council of Legal Education 2007 SLR 54 where the Supreme Court held that,

"A writ of Mandamus will not be issued when it appears that there is an impossibility of

performance by reasons of circumstances ..... "

8

This position was further discussed in the case of Suresh V. Basant AIR 1972 SC 1680 as

follows;

"Mandamus will not in general be issued to compel a Respondent to do what is impossible in law

or in fact. The relief may be denied when it would introduce and occasion confusion or disorder.

This is because the court while issuing the writ should keep in view that the issue of the writ

would not be futile."

As observed above the authorities responsible for the implementation of the said circulars have

repeatedly informed their difficulty in implementing the circulars to the Cabinet of Ministers of

the Central Government and to the Governor to the Sabaragamuwa Province and in these

circumstances granting a writ would not help the Petitioners, since the Respondents will not be

able to implement the said directive without the concurrence of the officials of the Central

Government including the Director General Management Service who are not before this court

as Respondents to the present application.

In these circumstances this court is not inclined to grant relief as prayed by the Petitioners. The

Petitioners application for writ of Mandamus is refused.

Application dismissed No cost is ordered.
