Petitioner in the present application has come before this court alleging

that the respondents in this case, specially the 18t to 3rd respondents

prevented him from taking the vein quartz from the Kotikambokka forest

reserve in Wellawaya. The Petitioner's position before this court was that

in 2013 he has made an application to the Forest Department in order to

remove vein quarts from Kotikambokka area which is an area covered by

Uma Oya Project. When the said application was made the petitioner

submits that by P6 he was permitted by the Forest Department to remove

the vein quartz for the year 2013. He further submits that the relevant

permits such as the permit from the G.S.M.B. The Environment Authority

1

\

and the Archeological Department had been obtained by the petitioner

after paying their fees in order to excavate the vein quartz. By P6 (a) and

P7 (a) he was permitted to remove 50 cubs of vein quartz in the year 2013

and 2014. However, since 2015 Forest Department has stopped issuing

permission even though the petitioner was in possession of other permits

that from the Environment Authority, GSMB, and the Archeological

Department. Petitioner submits that the GSMB on May 2016 has now

published an advertisement calling for labour contract to remove the vein

quartz from same Kottikambokka area and handed over them to the

GSMB Technical Services Private Limited fully owned stated Company.

Petitioner's position before this court was that the petitioner has spent a

large sum of money in preparing environmental assessment reports and

thereafter spent money on constructing roads inside the forest, but

however all of sudden the respondents have now decided to stop the

petitioner being excavated the vein quartz from Lot 6 of the Kottikambokka

area. In response to the above submissions made by learned counsel for

the petitioner, learned Senior State Counsel who represented the state has

brought to the notice that under the provision of Forest Ordinance the

conservator is empowered to issue permits but the petitioners are not

entitled as of right to ask for such permits to be issued for them.

He brought to our notice certain documentation as to how the original

permit was issued to the petitioner. We are satisfied that no proper bidding

2

process was followed when the petitioner was permitted to excavate the

vein quartz from the Kottikambokka area. As submitted by the learned

Senior State Counsel the petitioner has permitted to remove 40 cubs of

vein quartz in the year 2013 within the period of 10 days and again to

remove 10 cubs of vein quartz in the year 2014. For the year 2015 the

conservator has not issued any permit to the petitioner. It is also brought

to the notice of court that the state has now decided not to permit the

private contractors to remove vein quartz but by a cabinet decision it was

decided to take steps to remove vein quartz through a government agency

for the government to make profit rather than permitting a private

individual to make profit out of it. This is the state policy which is in

operation at the moment. It is also brought to the notice of court by the

learned Counsel for the 5th and 6th respondents that the 6th respondent is

a fully state owned company and they are acting on the directive and the

blessing of the government and on this occasion the 6th respondent has

published the news advertisement on the directive of the cabinet. When

considering the submissions made by counsel before us we observed that

the petitioner is not entitled as of right to ask for writ of mandamus from

this court directing the respondents to permit the petitioner to permit

excavation of the vein quartz from Kottikambokka area. We further

observe that when the petitioner was prevented in the year 2015 from

taking vein quartz, the petitioner had not taken any steps to come before

this court in order to obtain relief. Considering the facts placed before us

3

..

we are not inclined to issue notices on this matter. We therefore refuse

notices in this application. No cost is ordered. Application is refused.

Since the facts in CA Writ 183/2016 are almost similar except the lot

number referred to in the said application we make same order dismissing

the application since the parties agree to abide by the order in CA

180/2016.

P.Padman Surasena, J.

I agree.
