The plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Respondent) instituted action in the High Court of Western Provence

exercising civil jurisdiction (commonly known as the Commercial High

Court) against the Defendants Petitioners (hereinafter called and referred to

as the Petitioners). The parties arrived at a settlement and the Petitioner

agreed to pay a sum of money by way of installments. The Petitioner being

failed to comply the terms of settlement, the Court issued a writ of

execution to recover the money due. Being aggrieved by the said order, the

Petitioner presented this revision application to this Court seeking relief.

At the argument stage, we directed the parties to address Court on the

jurisdiction of this Court on revision applications from the Commercial

High Court. In the written submissions of the Respondent it was brought to

our notice that this issue has been taken up as far back as 10.02.2010, but

due to certain unavoidable circumstances such as the retirement of a Judge,

re constitution of the benches and awaiting for the decision of a divisional

bench, the issue was not finalized.

The Respondent referred to the journal entry dated 25.11.2014 and

submitted that this Court has made an order on 25.11.2014 that this Court

has no jurisdiction to entertain this revision application. The Court has not

come to a final decision on the issue of jurisdiction but it observed that there

is an issue. Therefore we cannot rely on the said journal entry alone to come

to a conclusion.

The Commercial High Court was established under the authority of

the High Court Special Provisions Act No. 10 of 1996. Section 2 of the Act

empowers to establish a High Court exercising civil jurisdiction. The section

2 (1) reads thus;

2. (1) Every High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province shall, with effect from such date as the

3

Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette appoint, in respect

of such High Court have exclusive jurisdiction and shall have

cognizance of and full power to hear and determine, in the manner

provided for by written law, all actions, applications and proceedings

specified in the First Schedule to this Act, if the party or parties

defendant to such action resides or reside, or the cause of action has

arisen, or the contract sought to be enforced was made, or in the case

of applications or proceedings under the Companies Act, No. 17 of

1982 the registered office of the Company is situated, within the

province for which such High Court is established.

The Act specifically provide for the procedure for appeals from the

judgments and orders of the High Court. The right of appeal was given by

subsection (1) to the party aggrieved by a judgment and sub section (2)

provides for an appeal after obtaining leave if aggrieved by any order. The

appeal in either case, only to the Supreme Court. The section reads thus;

5. (1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment pronounced

by a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution,

in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 2, in any action,

proceeding or matter to which such person is a party may prefer

an appeal to the Supreme Court against such judgment, for any

error in fact or in law. (Emphasis added.)

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by a

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution, in the

exercise of its jurisdiction under section 2 in the course of any

action, proceeding or matter to which such person is, or seeks to

be, a party, may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court against

such Order for the correction of any error in fact or in law, with

4

the leave of the Supreme Court first had and obtained (Emphasis

added)

(3) In this section, the expressions ''judgment'' and "order" shall

have the same meanings respectively, as In section 754 (5) of the

Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

The Commercial High Court is a first instance Court exercIsmg

original civil jurisdiction on certain matters. The Legislature thought it fit to

vest the appellate jurisdiction from the Commercial High Court to the

Supreme Court. it has been held in the case of Swasthika Textile Industries

Ltd. v. Thanthrige Dayarathne [1993] 2 Sri L R 348 at 352 that;

In dealing with The Agrarian Services (Amendment) Bill (Supreme

Court S.D. Nos. 2/91 and 4/91; determined on 7.2.91) this Court

referred to important principles governing the jurisdiction of courts

and tribunals exercising the judicial power of the people, and the

interpretation of Article 154P (3);

1. Apart from jurisdictions constitutionally vested and entrenched,

directly or indirectly, Parliament may, by ordinary legislation,

abolish, alter or transfer jurisdictions; Parliament may create a new

jurisdiction or transfer an existing jurisdiction, so long as such

jurisdiction is vested in as person or body constitutionally entitled to

exercise the judicial power of the people ;

2. The appellate and revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

under Article 138 (1) is not entrenched, as it is "subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law ",: it may therefore be

abolished, amended or transferred By contrast, its jurisdictions

under Articles 140 and 141 are entrenched; but for the proviso

5

inserted by the First Amendment, its jurisdiction under Article 140

cannot be transferred even to the Supreme Court;

The contention of the Counsel for the Petitioner is that the jurisdiction

of a Court cannot be excluded unless it is expressly provided. He cites

Brindra and submits that a statute should not be interpreted to exclude the

jurisdiction of Court unless it expressly does so. The section 5 of the High

Court Special Provisions Act No 10 of 1996 expressly provides that the

appellate jurisdiction from the Commercial High Court is vested in the

Supreme Court.

In the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara v. Veloo [2001] 3 Sri L R 91

Jayasinghe, J. referred to Kulatunga, J in Gunaratne v. Thambinayagam

[1993] 2 Sri L R 359 with approval and observed at page 99 that;

"The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that particularly in

the background of legislative provisions existing prior to the 13th

amendment (viz the Courts Ordinance, the Administration of Justice

Law, Article 138 of the Constitution and the relevant Statutes on Civil

and Criminal Procedure), the expression "appellate jurisdiction' (as

opposed to "original jurisdiction") would ordinarily include the

power to review decisions by way of appeal, revision or restitutio in

integrum; that Article 154 P (3) (b) enacted by 13th amendment

vested "appellate jurisdiction" in the High Court limited to appeal

and revision of the decisions of the Magistrate's Courts and Primary

Courts; that Section 3 of Act No. 19 of 1990 extended the exercise of

such jurisdiction to orders made by Labour Tribunals and orders

made under Section 5 and 9 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of

1979; and that in the context the expression the "appellate

jurisdiction" in Section 9 of the Act should not be limited to an appeal

6

made "eo nomine" but should be interpreted to include the power of

review by way of revision. "

In the present case the Petitioner moved this Court to act in revision

or restitutio in integrum which is also an extra ordinary remedy exercised by

the appellate courts to correct the errors. In the case of Sunil Chandra

Kumara v. Veloo (supra) it was observed that the remedy of restitutio in

integrum is also a remedy that comes within the appellate jurisdiction.

This Court has held in several case that the appellate jurisdiction in

respect of orders and judgments of the Commercial High Court is vested in

the Supreme Court. Australanka Exporters Pvt Ltd V. Indian Bank [2001] 2

Sri L R 156 is a case where the plaintiff instituted hypothecary action in

the Commercial High Court of Colombo, to recover a sum of money lent to

the Defendant, as the Defendant defaulted, the matter went ex parte and

decree was entered against the Defendant. The Application to purge default

was dismissed. Thereafter the Defendant sought to revise the said Order of

the High Court by way of a revision application filed in this Court and Raja

Fernando J. held that Appellate jurisdiction in respect of Judgments and

orders of the High Court of the Provinces made in the exercise of its civil

jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.

In the case of Senanayake and others v. Koehn and others [2002] 3

Sri L R 381 the petitioner-respondent instituted action under sections 210

and 211 of the Companies Act in the Commercial High Court seeking

certain relief. The High Court granted the relief prayed for. An appeal was

lodged against that order in the Supreme Court. The respondent-petitioner

moved the Court of Appeal in revision to make order staying the operation

of the judgment; there was no prayer to revise the judgment. Gamini

Amarathunga J observed at page 387 that "It is, therefore, my considered

view that it is not proper for this court to examine the legality of the

7

judgment of the Commercial High Court even for the limited purpose of

satisfying itself that the petitioner is entitled to the relief prayed for. "

It has been held by my sister Malinie Gunarathne J in the revision

application of the Global Rubber Industries (Pvt) Ltd. v. Ceylinco Insurance

PLC and others CA (PHC) APN 18/2015 CA minutes dated 18 11 2015 that

this Court has no jurisdiction in respect of orders of the Commercial High

Court.

My view is that this Court has no appellate jurisdiction including

revisionary jurisdiction and restitutio in integrum in respect of orders and

judgments of the High Court Exercising Civil Jurisdiction established under

the High Court Special Provisions Act No.1 0 of 1996.

Accordingly I dismiss this revision application. Under the

circumstances of this case, I order no costs.

Malinie Gunarathne J.

I agree.
