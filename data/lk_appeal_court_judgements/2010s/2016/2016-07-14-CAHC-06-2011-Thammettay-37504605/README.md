Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kegalle for committing the murder of

one S. Nilmini Upul Kumara alias Podi Ralahamy on or around 25.10.1995 an offence punishable

under section 296 of the Penal Code.

The accused -appellant who appeared before the High Court on notice on 28.10.1999 opted for a trial

before a judge without a jury, when the indictment was served on him. The accused-appellant who was

present before the High Court trial until December 2000 had absconded thereafter and the trial had

proceeded in the absence of the accused.

The Learned High Court Judge who convicted the accused-appellant on 27.06.2005, after imposing the

death penalty had issued an open warrant on him. The accused-appellant who failed to lodge an appeal

challenging the conviction and the sentence within the stipulated time was absconding until he was

arrested by the police on 20th April 2010.

When the accused-appellant was produced before the High Court after his arrest, the court had

proceeded under section 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and held an

inquiry under the said provision of the Law.

Section 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 reads thus;

241 (3) where in the course of or after the conclusion of the trial of an accused person

under sub-paragraph (i) of the paragraph (a) of subsection (1) or under

(a)

3

paragraph (b) of that subsection he appears before court and satisfies the court

that his absence from the whole or part of the trial was bona-fide then-

(b) where the trial has been concluded, the court shall set aside the conviction and

sentence, if any, and order that the accused be tried de novo.

As observed by this court, the accused-appellant had submitted a petition and affidavit before the

Learned High Court Judge giving reasons for his absence during the trial and as observed by the

Learned High Court Judge the only reason pleaded by the accused-appellant was the fact that he was

once discharged by the Learned Magistrate and therefore he did not attend the High Court. However

the Learned High Court Judge had observed that the said position taken up by the accused-appellant

before the High Court was incorrect since the accused-appellant had appeared before High Court

during the trial dates nearly for one year.

Since that was the only ground under which the accused-appellant had canvassed his bona-fide, the

High Court Judge after rejecting to act under the said version, refused the application for a de novo

trial and made order to implement the death sentence already imposed on the accused-appellant on

27.06.2005 after recording the allocutus on 07.02.2011.

Being dissatisfied with the said order made under section 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No 15 of 1979, the accused-appellant had preferred the present appeal before this court.

As observed by me earlier in this judgment, the accused-appellant had failed to lodge an appeal

immediately after the conviction in the year 2005.

Under these circumstances we see no appeal preferred before this court against the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the accused-appellant but the only appeal before this court is made against the

order of the High Court Judge made under 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act 15 of 1979.

In the said appeal the only grounds under which the accused-appellant had preferred the present appeal

is;

However when the present appeal was argued before this court, Learned Counsel who represented the

accused- appellant failed to made any submission with regard to the appeal before this court but made

submissions on the merits of the case, mainly on the evidence available in the said case,

5

As observed by this court, the appeal before this court only refers to the decision by the Learned Trial

Judge to reject the accused-appellant's application made under 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act and not against the trial proceeded in absentia against the accused-appellant.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General who represented the Attorney General requested the Court

to restrict the appeal only to petition of appeal before this court.

In this regard we would like to consider the provisions in section 203 along with section 331 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads thus;

"when the cases for the prosecution and defence are concluded, the Judge shall forthwith or

within ten days of the conclusion of the trial record a verdict of acquitted or conviction giving

his reasons therefore and if the verdict is one of conviction pass sentence on the accused

according to law."

Section 331 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which refers to filing of appeal reads thus;

331 (1) an appeal under this chapter may be lodged by presenting a petition of appeal or

application for leave to appeal to the Registrar of High Court within fourteen

days from the date when the conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed

against was pronounced.

The extent to which section 331 should adhered to was discussed in the case of Haramanis

Appuhamy V. Inspector of Police Bandaragama 66 NLR 526 by Sri Skandarajah J and held that the

period of time within which an appeal should be preferred must be calculated from the date on which

the reasons for the decision are given.

The High Court had pronounced the Judgment convicting the accused, giving its reasons for the said

conviction on 27. 06.2005 and the appeal referred to above was lodged before the High Court on 23rd

l

\

6

February 2011, 5 years and 7 months after the said conviction and sentence and therefore it is clearly

out of time.

Therefore it is clear that the only appeal before us is the appeal preferred against the decision of the

High Court made on ih February 2011 refusing the application made under section 241 (3) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act for a de novo trial.

Even though the counsel for the accused-appellant decided not to canvass the said order before this

court, we have perused the said order and of the view that the Learned High Court Judge had correctly

rejected the application after giving due consideration to the matters placed before him.

As discussed above, the position taken up by the accused-appellant before the High Court was that he

did not come before the High Court since he had been already discharged in the Magistrate Court.

However the above position taken up the accused-appellant was contrary to his own conduct, since he

had come before the High Court, received the Indictment and was present before the High Court for

near! y one year.

Since this was the only ground under which the application was supported under section 241 (3), the

Learned High Court Judge was correct in refusing the said application and therefore we see no reason

to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge when he refused the application and

made order to implement the sentence already imposed on the accused-appellant.

Even though the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had failed to canvass the case in hand

under section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, this court is mindful of the existence of the

Revisionary Jurisdiction with this court to revise orders of original court. The revisionary powers of

the Court of Appeal was discussed by Jayawickrama J, in the case of Soysa V. Silva and Others

[2002] 2 Sri LR 235 as follows;

I

"This power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent of and distinct

from the Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

Its object is the due administration to Justice and the correction of error, sometimes committed

by the Court itself, in order to avoid miscarriage of justice. Merino B.F. Vs. Seyed Mohomad

69 CL W 34. The power given to Superior Court by way of revision is wide enough to give it

the right to revise any order made by an original court, whether an appeal has been taken

against it or not. This right will be exercised in which an appeal is pending only in exceptional

circumstances as for example, to ensure that the decision given on appeal is not rendered

nugatory Athukorala V. Swaminathan 41 NLR 165, Silva V. Silva 44 NLR 494."

However when the court is exercising this discretionary remedy, the court must necessarily have

regard to the unseasonable delay and contumacious conduct of the accused in jumping bail.

In the case of Sudarman de Silva and Another V. Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri LR 11

Sharvananda CJ observed the importance of the contumacious conduct in a revision application as

against an appeal as follows;

"Contumacious conduct on the part of the applicant is relevant consideration when the exercise

of a discretion in his favour is involved, but not when he asserts his statutory right to appeal

and is not asking for the favour of any permission"

In the case of Opatha Mudiyanselage Perera V. AUorney General CA Revision 532/97 (CA minute

dated 21.10.1998)"

F.N.D Jayasuriya J observed the undue delay and contumacious conduct of the accused-appellant as

follows;

"These matters must be considered in limine before the court decides to hear the accused-

petitioner on the merits of his application. Before he passes the gateway to relief his aforesaid

j I I I ! !

contumacious conduct and his unreasonable and undue delay in filing the application must be

considered and determination made upon those matter before he is heard on the merits of the

application."

In the case in hand the accused-appellant who was present before the High Court when the indictment

was served on him had absconded since December 2000. The trial was concluded and the sentence

was imposed in his absence on 27.06 2005 and he was apprehended and product before the High Court

on 04.05.2010, ten years after he started absconding and five years after the sentence.

The above contumacious conduct of the accused-appellant and his delay in coming before this court

does not permit us to entertain this discretionary remedy. In these circumstances we are not inclined to

exercise our revisionary powers and interfere with the Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 27.06.2005. For the reasons given above, this court

a) See no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge dated

07.02.2011 when he refused the application for a de novo trial and made order to

implement the sentence already imposed on 27.06.2005.

b) Is not inclined to exercise the revisionary power of this court and to interfere with the

Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge dated 27.06.2005.

Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
