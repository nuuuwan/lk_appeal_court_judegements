Superintendent of Stafford Estate and two others reported in the Bar Association Law Journal 2013

Volume XX page 122 held that the said Provincial High Court did not have jurisdiction to issue such

writs in respect of State lands. Counsel moves that the judgment of the Provincial High Court dated

11-06.2008 be set aside and moves that he may be permitted to withdraw this appeal after said

judgment of the provincial High Court is set aside.

Court to be set aside because she has no reason to say so. Counsel for the Petitioner-Respondent

submits that he is willing to participate in a fresh inquiry before the Divisional Secretary.
