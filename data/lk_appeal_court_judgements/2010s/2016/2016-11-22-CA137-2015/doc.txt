The Accused - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High Court of Gampaha for committing offences punishable under

Section 354 and Section 365(B) of the Penal Code.

The first charge was for kidnapping a minor under the age of 14 years by the

name of Mohommed Rafaideen Mohommed lruffain on or about the 18th of

November 2013 in Rukmale from the custody of his lawful guardian Mohommed

Razik Mohommed Rafaideen which is an offence punishable under Section 354 of

the Penal Code.

The second charge was for committing the offence of grave sexual abuse on

the said Mohommed Rafaideen Mohommed lruffain in the course of the same

transaction as the 1 st charge by placing his penis on the genitals of the said

Mohommed Rafaideen Mohommed Iruffain which is an offence punishable under

Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act

No. 29 of 1998.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the offence and upon conclusion of the

trial against the Appellant the Learned Trial Judge by Judgement dated 07.07.2015

convicted the Appellant for both chargers as contained in the indictment in the

following manner;

1 st Count - 1 year rigorous imprisonment and a fine ofRs. 2,5001- carrying a

default sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment.

2nd Count - 7 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine ofRs. 7,5001- carrying

a default sentence of 9 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred the instant appeal under Section 331 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code

Act No. 15 of 1979 inter alia to set aside the conviction and the sentence of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 07.07.2015, to pardon and acquit the Appellant

and to reduce the penal sanctions imposed on the Appellant.

The prosecution lead the evidence of 6 witnesses including the victim and

his father, to establish the case for the prosecution. In evidence it was revealed that

on or about 18.11.2013 at around 7.00 pm the victim who was a boy 8 years of age

was sent by his grandfather to borrow Rs.2,0001- from the Appellant. Having given

the money to the victim the Appellant had thereafter sent the boy to buy a sim card

from the nearby boutique. When the victim returned from this chore the Appellant

had forced the victim on to his bed, removed his clothing and placed his penis on

the penis of the victim. The victim had then pushed the Appellant away and run

home and informed his grandfather and the other inhabitants of the house about the

incident.

The Appellant in his dock statement while denying the verSIOn of the

prosecution admitted that the victim was sent to his place to borrow money by the

grandfather of the victim and maintained that the prosecutions version was a

fabricated story since the grandfather of the victim harboured a grudge against the

Appellant for being an informant to the Police. The Appellant took up the position

that the victim had peeped in to the Appellants room when he was retrieving

money from the cupboard and the Appellant had therefore knocked the victim on

the head and that it was this knock-on-the-head which the victim had complained

of to the grandfather who eventually misrepresented it to the Police.

When the appeal was taken up for argument the learned Counsel for the

Appellant informed Court that the conviction of the Appellant will not be

challenged and that submissions will be made for the limited purpose of reducing

the sentence.

The contention of the Appellant was three fold;

i) The Learned High Court Judge was seemingly in favour of sentencing

the Appellant for a lessor term than the mandatory minimum sentence

or was in favour of imposing a suspended sentence,

ii) That it is violative of Article 4( c) of the Constitution to Impose a

mandatory minimum sentence, and

iii)That the sentence of 7 years for Count No.2 is disproportionate and

excessIve.

Before I consider the contention of the Appellant it is prudent to note that

although the learned Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that there is no

indication in the sentencing order whether the sentences are to concurrently or

{,

5

consecutively, it is clearly stated by the learned trial Judge that the sentences are to

run concurrently (vide page 194 of the Appeal Brief).

I shall now consider the arguments submitted by the learned Counsel for the

Appellant for the limited purpose of reducing the sentence.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the learned trial Judge was

seemingly in favour of sentencing the Appellant for a lessor term than the

mandatory minimum sentence or was in favour of imposing a suspended sentence.

He further submits that the learned High Court Judge has stated in the Judgment

that there are no legal provisions to hand a suspended sentence for the Accused-

Appellant. To test the accuracy of the submission I must consider the provisions

under which a trial Judge may make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment. As correctly submitted by the learned DSG on behalf of the

Complainant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) the operative

provision in this regard is Section 303(2)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 as amended by Act No. 47 of 1999 which reads;

A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if-

(a) a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment has been prescribed

by law for the offence in respect of which the sentence is imposed;

or ...

In light of the above provision it was correct for the learned High Court Judge to

state that there are no legal provisions to hand a suspended sentence for the

Accused-Appellant as there is a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years rigorous

imprisonment as per Section 365 B (2) (b) of the Penal Code.

I must now consider whether the learned trial Judge had intended to pass a

suspended sentence but could not do so as she was legally barred considering that

her hands were tied in view of the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by

law. As submitted by the learned DSG on behalf of the Respondent nowhere in the

Judgement of the learned High Court Judge is it stated that this case warrants

giving a suspended sentence. The learned High Court Judge has however applied

her judicial mind to the culpability of the Appellant and has correctly evaluated

that the evidence presented by the prosecution as establishing the offences

contained in the indictment. The Learned trial Judge points out that the evidence of

the prosecution is void of any contradictions or omissions, is consistent and has

concluded that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is

only on the date of sentencing i.e on 07.07.2015 that the learned High Court judge

states that there are no legal provisions to hand a suspended sentence for the

Accused-Appellant in light of the chargers in the indictment. It is therefore the

view of this Court that the leaned Trial Judge was merely articulating the fact that

Section 365B (2)(b) of the Penal code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act

No. 29 of 1998 carries a minimum mandatory sentence.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant relies on the ratio in Supreme Court

Reference 03/2008, 2008 BLR 160 in which the facts are different to the facts of

the instant case.

The case of Rohana Vs. The Attorney General (S.C. Appeal No. 89A12009)

relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Appellant as following the ratio in

Supreme Court Reference 03/2008 is also a case in which the prosecutrix had a

love affair with the accused and was charged for the offence of statutory rape and

as such must be distinguished from the instant case.

The instant case relates to an act of grave sexual abuse on a boy of 8 years of

age with no consent whatsoever.

The learned DSG for the Respondent relies on the Judgment of my brother

Judge Sunil Rajapakse J in the unreported case of The Attorney General Vs. Hewa

Welimunige Gunasena CA (PHC) APN No. 110/2012 delivered on 12.02.2014 in

which a suspended sentence was awarded to the Accused for a charge of grave

sexual abuse on a minor in the High Court. His Lordship cites the case of AG V s.

Ranasinghe 1993 (2) SLR 81 which lists down reasons where an offence of rape

calls for an immediate custodial sentence and aggravating factors. His Lordships

further cites the cases of Attorney General vs H.N.de Silva 1 {1956} 57 NLR 121

and Attorney General vs Mendis 1995 1 SLR 138 in which cases it was held that;

"in assessing punishment the Judge should consider the matter of sentence

both from the point of view of the public and the offender. The Judge should

first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the

act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal

Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should also

regard the effect of the punishment, as a deterrent and consider in what

extent it will be effective.'

His Lordship thereafter states that;

"I am of the opinion that the facts relating to this case warrants that the

accused should be severely dealt with. Therefore a sentence of two years

rigorous imprisonment suspended for ten years on the accused for a grave

child abuse is a very lenient sentence considering the beastliness of the

crime. When an offence of child abuse is proved victims of tender age and

innocent behaviour the sentence of imprisonment should be imposed

severely."

His Lordship Sunil Rajapakse J, thereafter enhanced the sentence of 2 years

R.I. imposed on the accused by the learned High Court Judge, which has been

suspended for a period of ten years and sentenced the accused to a term of seven

(7) years rigorous imprisonment.

Although this Court is not bound by this precedent I do find that this

sentiment echo the attitude adopted by this Court in dealing with cases relating to

grave sexual abuse especially that of a minor.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that certain serious crimes

which involve the killing of another person do not have a mandatory minimum

sentence (For instance Sections 297, 298 and 300 of the Penal Code) and in

contrast the offence of grave sexual abuse does not justify a minimum mandatory

sentence. However, I cannot agree with this contention especially where in the

instant case the Appellant is a father of two children who attend the same school as

the victim and in a context where the conviction of the Appellant is not challenged

in Appeal. I find that the offence committed by the Appellant is very serious in

nature and this Court takes note of the conduct of the Appellant and the age of the

victim (8 years of age) when the crime was perpetrated on him.

Therefore, I cannot agree with the argument made on behalf of the Appellant

that the sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment for Count No. 2 is

disproportionate and excessive.

It must also be noted that the sentence imposed on the Appellant was only

the minimum mandatory sentence and that the learned Trial judge did not extend

I I

I

I, f

judicial discretion to consider any other custodial sentence between the minimum

sentence and the maximum sentence prescribed by law been 7 - 20 years.

In considering whether the mandatory minimum sentence is disproportionate

and is in violation of Article 4( c), 11 and 12( 1) of the Constitution it is conceded

that it was held in S.C. reference 03/2008 and S.C. Appeal No. 17/2013 that the

minimum mandatory sentence is in conflict with the above mentioned Articles of

the Constitution and the High Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence that

it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial discretion notwithstanding the

minimum mandatory sentence.

It is pertinent to note the case of Dharma Sri Tissa Kumara Wijenaike V s.

The Hon. Attorney General S.C. Appeal No. 179/2012 in which Her Ladyship

Tilakawardena J considered the application of Supreme Court Reference 03/2008,

2008 BLR 160 on the minimum mandatory sentence and held that it should be in

only limited instances. In the said case it was held that;

"it is the Courts belief that the legislation, as found in the Penal Code,

reflects the law as it should be, as it is a result of the will of the Parliament

and the will of the People."

And further that;

" ... the Court accepts that with regards to sentencing, the views of all parties

involved in the case must be considered in a balanced manner, in particular

where violations are carried out with impunity, even after the legislature has

placed a minimum mandatory sentence."

Her Ladyship in the said case was of the view that;

"Court ratifies the principle that in such cases, where the Accused is under

16 years of age, the sentencing would depend on the facts and circumstances

of each case and if the age of the Accused was 16 years or under, their age

would be a material and relevant fact. This however, in the eyes of this

Court, would only apply in cases where the Accused is under the age of 16."

Having considered the circumstances of the instant appeal in its totality I

take the view that 7 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on the Appellant by the

learned trail Judge is lawful and appropriate. I further hold that judicial discretion

should not be exercised to impose a lesser sentence and/or a suspended sentence in

matters concerning serious offences such as the offence for which the Appellant in

the instant application stands convicted.

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned

trial judge against the Appellant on both counts by judgment dated 07.07.2015 and

the sentence is to run concurrently as mentioned in the said order.

However, taking into consideration the period the Appellant has been III

remand prison, I order that the sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment takes

effect from the date of conviction of the Appellant i.e. 07.07.2015.

Appeal Dismissed.
