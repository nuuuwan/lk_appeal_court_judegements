L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is a revision application filed against a sentence imposed by

the High Court of Colombo. Several accused were indicted before High

Court of Colombo in connection with the bomb explosion of a railway

train at Dehiwala. The Indictment contained 1708 counts. The 1 st, 2nd and

3rd accused pleaded guilty for the 1st and 2nd counts. Consequently, the

State withdrew all the other counts against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused.

After hearing the submissions, learned High Court Judge convicted the

said accused on their own admission and sentenced the 1 st and 2nd accused

for a total of 10 years RI and the 3rd accused, the wife of the 1 st accused,

for a total of 5 years RI.

The mother of the 2nd accused filed this revision application on

behalf of the 2nd accused, after 9 months of passing the sentence, stating

that there is a disparity in sentencing. The 2nd accused has not appealed

against the sentence. The reason given by the mother is that the 2nd

accused was wrongly advised that there is no appeal against a sentence.

At the hearing the State Counsel raised two preliminary objections

with regard to the maintainability of this application, namely that the

petitioner, the mother of the 2nd accused, has on locus standi and that

there is no exceptional circumstances.

Firstly I will consider the locus standi of the mother of the 2nd

accused. In the petition she states that she files this application on behalf

her son the 2nd accused, but there is no any documentary proof that her

son has given her any authority to file this application. The proxy is

signed by the mother. The affidavit also signed by her. Under these

circumstances, at any time the 2nd accused can come forward and deny

that he has given any authority to his mother to act on his behalf.

The reason averred in the petition for not filing an appeal is that he

was erroneously advised that there is no appeal. This is a fact wholly

within the knowledge of the 2nd accused. She does not say that she was

advised as such. The mother cannot swear to a fact which is within the

knowledge of her son. It becomes hearsay. It has been held in the case of

Kumarasiri and another v. Rajapakse [2006] 1 Sri L R 359 that that "it is

to be seen that it is the flesh and blood of the affidavit which gives life to

the skeleton in the petition". If the affidavit contains the hearsay

evidence, it cannot give life to the petition.

It is the mother of the 2nd accused who filed this application. The

Attorney At Law who filed this petition said in the petition that "The

Accused Petitioner above named appearing by his Attorney ..... " But the

proxy was signed by the mother. In the proxy she says that she was

authorized by her son to appear on his behalf. No any documentary proof

submitted to substantiate that fact. Therefore this application has to be

considered as an application filed by the mother of the 2nd accused and

not by the 2nd accused himself. It was held in the case of Senathileke v.

Attorney General and another [1998] 3 Sri L R 290 that the father of the

accused has no locus standi to maintain a revision application. It has been

held that;

Upon this application filed seeking a revision of the orders,

judgment, findings, conviction and sentence imposed by the High

Court Judge of Balapitiya, the accused's father has preferred this

application and the accused who was convicted and sentenced has

neither appealed against the aforesaid judgment nor moved this

court in revision of the said orders and sentence. The first issue

that arises is whether the father of the accused has a locus standi

to maintain the said revision application. In the recent decision in

Albert v. Wedamulla (1) at 418, the issue of locus standi was

considered by me and I held that the petitioner in that case did not

have a locus standi to maintain that particular application before

the Magistrate's Court. My judgment in regard to the concept of

locus standi has been affirmed in the Supreme Court. Could a

father of a convicted accused allege that he is aggrieved by the

judgment and sentence imposed on his son by the High Court

Judge of Balapitiya. Can the father legitimately in such

circumstances assert that he has a genuine grievance because a

judgment and sentence has been pronounced which prejudicially

affects his own interests - A. G. of Gambia v. N' Jie(2) at 634. Vide

S. M THIO'S monograph on locus standi and Judicial Review. On

the question of locus standi and the problem of discretion, see De

Smith Judicial Review of Administrative Act 1987 impression of the

4th edition - at pages 409 to 421. We hold that the petitioner, who

is the father of the accused, has no locus standi to maintain the

said revision application and we are fortified in that view by the

judgments pronounced by Justice Sharvananda in the Ceylon

Mercantile Union v. The Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka(3)

and in Sudharman de Silva v. The Attorney-General(4) at 14 and at

15. In the Ceylon Mercantile Union case, Justice Sharvananda

held that the plaintiff a registered trade union, has no locus standi

or standing to institute a civil action on behalf of its members

against the defendant corporation for a declaration that according

to contracts entered into between its members and the defendant

certain revised rates of allowances were payable to them.

Under these circumstances I hold that the mother of the accused

has no locus standi to institute this revision application.

Without prejudice to the above, I will consider whether the

petitioner can have and maintain this revision application.

The 2nd accused would have appealed against the sentence as of a

right. The Criminal Procedure Code provides for that. Section 331

provides for a convicted accused who IS in prison custody to file an

appeal. The section reads thus;

331. (1) An appeal under this Chapter may be lodged by presenting

a petition of appeal or application for leave to appeal to the

Registrar of the High Court within fourteen days from the

date when the conviction, sentence or order sought to be

appealed against was pronounced,'

Provided that a person in prison may lodge an appeal by

stating within the time aforesaid to the jailer of the prison in

which he is for the time being confined his desire to appeal

and the grounds therefor and it shall thereupon be the duty

of such jailer to prepare a petition of appeal and lodge it

with the High Court where the conviction, sentence or order

sought to be appealed against was pronounced

He is only prevented from appealing against the conviction for the

reason that he was convicted on his own admission of guilt, but he is not

prevented from appealing against sentence.

336. On an appeal against the sentence whether passed after trial

by jury or without a jury, the Court of Appeal shall, if it

thinks that a different sentence should have been passed,

quash the sentence, and pass other sentence warranted in law

by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in substitution

therefor as it thinks ought to have been passed and in any

other case shall dismiss the appeal.

The accused has been represented by an Attorney At Law on the

date he pleaded guilty for the offence and submissions were also made on

his behalf by the said Attorney. Therefore, the statement that he was

wrongly advised is not acceptable. (As I pointed out earlier, authenticity

of this statement is questionable.)

Revision is a discretionary remedy and one cannot have it as of a

right. Especially when there is an alternative remedy such as a right of

appeal and that right is not exercised, exceptional circumstances have to

be pleaded and established to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction.

A. R. G. Fernando, v. W. S. C. Fernando, 72 NLR 549

Where a right of appeal lies, an application in revision will not be

entertained unless there are exceptional circumstances which

require the intervention of the Court by way of revision.

Inspector of Police, Avissawella V Fernando. 30 NLR 482

Where an accused person is warned and discharged, the remedy

open to the complainant is by way of appeal.

Where the proper remedy is by way of appeal, an application for

revision will not be entertained save in exceptional circumstances.

After considering several authorities, Nanayakkara, J. held in the

case of Caderamanpulle v. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd [2001]3 Sri L R 112

at 116 that

When the decided cases cited before us are carefully examined, it

becomes evident in almost all the cases cited, that powers of

revision have been exercised only in a limited category of

situations. The existence of exceptional circumstances is a

precondition for the exercise of the powers of revision and the

absence of exceptional circumstances in any given situation results

in refusal of remedies. It is evident that revisionary powers being a

discretionary remedy, the court has exercised that right where

there are exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of

Court,

It was held in the case of Dharmaratne and another v Palm Paradise

Cabanas Ltd and others [2003]3 Sri L R 24 that;

1. Legal submissions in the Petition do not indicate reasons why

the Court of Appeal should exercise revisionary powers.

Per Amaratunga, J

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which

the court selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary

method of rectification should be adopted, if such a selection

process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will

become a gateway of every litigant to make a second appeal in the

garb of a Revision Application or to make an appeal in situations

where the legislature has not given a right of appeal. "

2. The practice of Court is to insist in the exercise of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken

deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed

In the present case this reVISIOn application is filed without

exercising the right of appeal. Therefore, it has become necessary to

consider whether there are any exceptional circumstances to interfere

with the High Court Judge's order. The only reason pleaded by the

mother of the 2nd accused is that there is a disparity in the sentence. It has

been submitted to the learned High Court Judge that the 1st and the 3rd

accused are husband and wife. The wife, the 3rd accused has given birth to

a child in the prisons when she was in remand custody. The mother and

the child were separated for nearly 18 years and the child has reached the

age of sitting for the OIL Exam. Therefore, the difference in the sentences

passed on the 1 st and 2nd accused and the 3rd accused cannot be said that is

without a reason. If one co-accused receives a more severe sentence than

the other when there is no good reason for the difference, may be a reason

for an appeal.

H.N.J.Perera J. considering the issue of disparity in the case of

Rathnasiri Silva Kaluperuma v. The State C.A.Case No:-248113 held that;

Dealing with the subject disparity of sentence as a ground of

appeal Archbold recognizes that there are "a number of forms of

disparity and it can occur in a number of different ways. (Archbold

2012, 5 - 159, p. 608.)

"Where an offender has received a sentence which is not open to

criticism when considered in isolation, but which is significantly

more severe than has been imposed on his accomplice, and there is

no reason for the differentiation, the court of appeal may reduce

the sentence, but only if the disparity is serious. It has been said

that the court would interfere where "right-thinking members of the

public, with full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances

(would) consider that something had gone wrong with the

administration of justice. "(per Lawton I .J in R. V. Fawcett

5 Cr. App. R.(s) 15 CA.

In the present case the accused were charged for a bomb explosion

destroying property and causing death to people. Once the gravity of the

offence is considered, it is obvious that they must be dealt with severely.

H.N.J.Perera J. in the case of Rathnasiric Silva Kaluperuma (supra) cited

an Indian authority with approval and held that;

Primarily the punishment for crime is for the good of the state and

the safety of society. Rex V. Dash (1948) 91 Can c. c. 187. It is also

intended to be a deterrent to others for committing similar crimes.

In Rajive V. State of Rajastan (1996)2 sec 175 it was held that the

Court will be failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not

awarded for a crime which has been committed not only against

the individual but also against the society to which the criminal

belong.

In State of MP V Bablu Nat! (2009) 2 sec 272 it was held that -

"The principle governing imposition of punishment would depend

upon the facts and circumstances of each case. An offence which

affects the morale of the society should be severely dealt with.

Socio economic status, religion, race, caste or creed of the accused

and the victim although may not be wholly irrelevant, should be

eschewed in a case of this nature, particularly when parliament

itself had laid down minimum sentence. "

Learned High Court Judge considered the fact that the mother was

separated from the child for nearly two decades and only she was

sentenced leniently by imposing the minimum mandatory term of

imprisonment and the two male persons involved were punished severely.

The differentiation was with a reason.

There are no exceptional circumstances In the instant case to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction.

I uphold the preliminary objections and dismiss the application.

I order no costs.
