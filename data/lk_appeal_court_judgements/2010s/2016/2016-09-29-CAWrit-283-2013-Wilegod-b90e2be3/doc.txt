Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner to the present application Wilegoda Liyanage Sajeewana Rohana Rasika Gunawardena

has come before this court seeking inter alia,

b) Issue an order in the nature of writ of Certiorari quashing the decision/action of the lSI and

3rd Respondents to insert the name of the 51h Respondent as the owner of the Agricultural

Land in the Register of Permit/Grants under the Land Development Ordinance marked as

"X13" and to direct the deletion of the 51h Respondent's name in the said Register;

3

c) Issue an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus compelling the 1St, 2nd and 3rd Respondents

to hold an inquiry to decide as to whose name should be inserted according to law;

d) Issue an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus to thereafter insert the Petitioner's name as

the owner of the Agricultural Land in the Register of Permit/Grants under the Land

Development Ordinance marked as "XI3".

Learned Counsel for all the parties agreed when this matter came up on 27.04.2016, before this court

to rely fully on their written submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based on the material

that have been adduced by the parties in their pleadings and written submissions.

As revealed before this court, Mahagedara Vidana Ralalage Rosalin Nona was the original permit

holder to the land referred to in original permit bearing No. 9496 dated 26.10.1963. The said permit

was later converted to a grant in the year 1982.

The said grant holder Rosalin Nona had nominated her eldest son Wilegoda Liyanage Gunawardena

as the successor for the said grant and the said nomination was properly registered in the relevant

land ledger.

The said nominated successor W.L. Gunawardena had died on 30th July 1993 during the life time of

the grant holder and, the grant holder Rosalin Nona had died on 23rd January 2003 without making a

fresh nomination for succession.

The eldest surviving son of the deceased grant holder Rosalin Nona, namely W.L. Karunathilake had

made a request to nominate him as the successor to the said land, and after an inquiry held before all

the parties, including the Petitioner to the present application, a decision had been taken to nominate

the said W.L. Karunathilake as the successor to the land in question. It is the said decision which is

challenged before this court in the present application.

4

The Petitioner to the present application, who is the eldest son of the late W.L. Gunawardena has

taken up the position that it is illegal and unjust for the 151 Respondent to wipe out all rights of the

heirs of the 151 born child of the grantee and under the provisions of the 3rd Schedule of the Land

Development Ordinance, the 151 born child should inherit after the demise of the grantee. The

petitioner has further submitted that he being the eldest son of the 151 born child of the grantee

Rosalin Nona, the 2nd born child, the 51h Respondent cannot be considered to be nominated as the

successor to a land, the 151 born child had inherited.

Before considering the above arguments raised by the Petitioner before this court, I would like to

first discuss the relevant legal provision with regard to succession under the Land Development

Ordinance.

Section 49 of the Land Development Ordinance 19 of 1935 (as amended)

"Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual

sum by virtue of the provisions of subsection (3) of section 19A, or of an owner of a holding,

without leaving behind his or her spouse, or where such permit-holder or owner died leaving

behind his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to the land alienated to

that permit- holder on the permit or holding or upon the death of such spouse, a person

nominated as successor by such permit-holder or owner shall succeed to that land or

holding."

Section 61 of the Land Development Ordinance 19 of 1935 (as amended)

"The death during the lifetime of the owner of a holding or a permit-holder of a person who

has been nominated by that owner or permit-holder as a successor to that holding or the land

alienated on the permit shall operate as a cancellation of a nomination of that person as a

successor."

5

Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance 19 of 1935 (as amended)

"If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to succeed, or if the

nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the title to the land

alienated on a permit to a permit-holder who at the time of his or death was paying an annual

sum by virtue of the provisions of subsection (3) of section 19A or to the holding of an owner

shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without leaving behind his or her

spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind his or her spouse, upon

the failure of holding, or upon the death of such spouse devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the

Third Schedule."

Rule 1 (b) of the 3rd schedule to the Land Development Ordinance 19 of 1935 (as amended)

(b) Title to a holding for the purposes of section 72 shall devolve on one only of the

relatives of the permit-holder or owner in the order of priority in which they are

respectively mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred to the

younger where there are more relatives than one in any group.

Table

i) Sons vii) Brothers

ii) Daughters viii) Sisters

iii) Grandsons ix) Uncles

iv) Granddaughters x) Aunts

v) Father xi) Nephews

vi) Mother xii) Nieces

In this rule, "relative" means a relative by blood and not by marriage.

Under section 49 above a nominated successor will only be able to succeed to the land,

(a). Where the permit holder or the owner of a holding died without leaving behind his or her

spouse

(b). If the permit holder or the owner of the holding had died leaving behind his or her spouse, in

such a situation the nominated successor will succeed only after the death of the spouse or

upon the failure of the spouse to succeed to the land.

Section 61 deals with a situation where the death of the nominated successor takes place during the

life time of the permit holder or the owner of the holding and according to this section in such a

situation the said nomination shall operate as a cancellation of such nomination.

Section 72 had provided the succession to take place under the 3rd Schedule, if

a) No successor has been nominated or,

b) If the nominated successor fails to succeed or,

c) If the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of ordinance

When the above provisions are considered with the facts and circumstances of the case in hand it

is clear, that the eldest son and the nominated successor of the original grant holder had died on

30th July 1993 prior to the death of the grant holder who had died 23rd January 2003. Therefore it

is clear that under section 49 he cannot succeed to the land. It is further observed that, with the

operation of the provisions in section 61 the nomination made by the grant holder shall operate

as a cancellation of the nomination of W.L. Gunawardene.

In the absence of fresh nomination thereafter by the grant holder, the only conclusion this court

can arrive is that there was no nomination made with regard to the succession by the grant holder

Rosalin Nona.

7

Since Rosalin Nona had died without nominating a successor, the succession will have to be

decided under section 72 read with Rule 1 (b) of the 3rd Schedule only.

In the said circumstance the succession rights will be passed on to the eldest living son of the

deceased grant holder and therefore we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the lSI

and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondent to nominate and/or insert the name of the 51h Respondent as the

successor or the owner of the agricultural land referred to the present application.

We therefore dismiss the application of the Petitioner but make no order with regard to cost.

Application is dismissed.
