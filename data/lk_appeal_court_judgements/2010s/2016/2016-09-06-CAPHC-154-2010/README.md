CASE-NO- CA (PH C) 154/2010- JUDGMENT- 30.08.2016

P.R Walgama,J

The instant appeal lies to impugned the order of the Learned

High Court Judge dated 14.12.2010, and the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 13.02.2007, by which orders the liability of the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant to contribute the EPF was affirmed

and ordered the payment thereof.

The Respondent instituted action in the Magistrate Court of

Bandarawela by tendering a certificate which was issued in terms

of Section 38(1) of Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958.

By the said certificate the Respondent has claimed a sum of

Rs.47,72,799.25 as the contribution and a sum of Rs.20,30,398.17

a the surcharge has been claimed to be recovered.

The Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant after appearing in Court

admitted the liability and proceeded to pay the said amount by

instalment.

It is the categorical position of the Respondent - Petitioner -

Appellant that at one stage the garment industry faced a severe

drawback due to the open economy introduced by the

Government policy. As a result of the said policy the fabrics were

imported for a lesser price.

Therefore it is contended by the Petitioner - Appellant that at a

time when the garment industry was undergoing sever losses

the Complainant - Respondent had filed action in the Magistrate

3

Court to recover the said amount, as a amount due to the

employees.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner - Appellant moved

the High Court in Revision to have the said order set aside or

vacate.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts placed

before him had dismissed the application of the Petitioner-

Appellant by his order dated 14.12.2010.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner - Appellant,

appealed to this Court to have the said impugned order set

aside or vacate.

The only contention of the Appellant as per petition was that,

Respondent has deprived the Appellant from the relief given to

the employer regarding the surcharge.

Nevertheless when this matter was taken up for argument the

Petitioner - Appellant drew the attention of this Court to the fact

that the certificate marked as P1 as the same does not indicate

the necessary details contemplated in Section 38(2) of the

Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended by Act

No. 8 of 1971.

To buttress the above position the Counsel for the Petitioner-

Appellant has adverted this Court to the decided cases wherein it

was held that the necessary particulars should be indicated in the

certificate filed in terms of Section 38(2) of the Employees

Provident Fund Act.

In the case of MOHOMED AMEER VS. YAPA ASSISTANT

COMMISSIONER OF LABOUR -1998 lSLR- 156 held thus;

"Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fond Act No. 15 of

1958 requires that the employees in respect of whom default is

alleged must be named or otherwise adequately identified; and

that (at least) where default is alleged in respect of a period

during which there has been changes in remuneration and/ or

rates of contributions, the remuneration in relation to which the

contributions and default has been computed must also be

disclosed"

Further the case cited by the Petitioner - Appellant is CITY

CARRIERS LTD .VS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

Where no particulars contained in the Certificate, but

only the total sum alleged to be due.

contain

Therefore the facts emerged from the above case is different from

the case in hand. It is viewed from the certificate marked Pi

certain particulars contained in the said certificate. Besides it is

salient to note that the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant has

agreed in the Magistrate Court to pay the afore said sum by

instalment, and after a period of time due to the unforeseen

situation in the country in the garment industry the Petitioner-

Appellant has been unable to pay the said instalment as agreed

in Court.

Therefore in the above setting this Court is of the view as the

Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant has agreed to pay the amount

due and due to the above reason if he has defaulted to make

tI ~

the payment will not make him entitled to challenge the validity

of the alleged certificate at the stage of the Appeal. To cap it

all this court is of the view that no material prejudice has been

caused to the Appellant by not giving the names of the

employees and their emoluments.

The reasons expiated above the court is compel to dismiss the

appeal.

Accordingly we dismissed the appeal subject to a cost of

Rs.I0,OOOj.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
