JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner in his petition has stated in his petition

1. that he is a founder member of the board of trustees of Bagawan Sri

Sathya Sai Centre Trust of Sri Lanka

6

II. that he was compelled by duressto tender his resignation on or

about 2009-03-12 as the international chairman of the Prasanthi

Council of Bagawan Sri Sathya Sai Organization Dr. Michael Goldstine

ordered him by a telephone message to tender his resignation

III. that the 2nd Respondent did not acknowledge or accept the said

purported resignation

IV. that he by a letter dated 2009-11-10 addressed to the 2nd

Respondent withdrew the purported resignation which was not

accepted by the board of trustees of the 1st Respondent

V. that the 3rd respondent by his letter dated 2014-09-30 informed him

that he has not been removed but has resigned from his position as a

trustee of the 1st Respondent and that the trust has acted on the

basis of his resignation. This letter has been marked and produced as

POS.

It is convenient to turn to the prayers of the Petitioner before proceeding

further. The Petitioner has prayed inter alia

a) for a writ of certiorari to quash the decisions / determinations

contained in the documents marked P OS dated 2014-09-30and P 08

dated 2014-12-18

7

b) for a writ of Mandamus to compel and / or direct the 1st - 5th and ih -

12th & 14th Respondents to perform the statutory and public duties

and functions and recognize and allow the Petitioner to function as a

member of the board of trustees of the 1st Respondent.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Writ jurisdiction of this court could be invoked in this case because it was

by an Act of Parliament that the 1st Respondent has been incorporated.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the 1st - 5th, ih - 12th & 14th

Respondents however submitted that this is not a case in which Writ

jurisdiction of this Court could be exercised.

Lord Justice Atkin, has summed up, the circumstances in which the Writs of

Certiorari and prohibition are available in the following famous words which

on numerous occasions have been cited and followed by our courts; It is as

follows.

" whenever anybody of persons having legal authority to determine

questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act

judicially act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to the

controlling jurisdiction of the Kings bench division exercised in these writs."

8

For convenience, this dictum could be broken up to form into several limbs

in the following manner;

"whenever anybody of persons

I. having legal authority

II. to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and

III. having the duty to act judicially

IV. act in excess of their legal authority,

they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the Kings bench

division exercised in these writs."

In the light of the facts of the case in hand, it becomes relevant to observe

that what the above dictum contemplates are rights which are of public

nature as opposed to rights of private nature. Hence the primary question

that this Court has to consider is, whether a Writ would, in the light of the

given set of facts, lie against the Respondents of this case.

The name of the relevant Act is "Board of Trustees of the Baghawan Sri

Sathya Sai Central Trust of Sri Lanka (Incorporation) Act, No. 38 of 2007".

The preamble ,of the Act makes it clear that the purpose qf the Act is to

incorporate this trust. Section 5 of the Act deals with the powers of this

trust amongst which nothing of public nature is found. Indeed only a

glance through this Act would be sufficient to conclude that none of the

Respondents named in this Petition has been vested with any legal

authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects as

9

envisaged in the above dictum~ In other words this Act has not entrusted

any authority on the trustees of this trust, the exercise of which would

bring them amenable to the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court which is

governed by a regime of Public Administrative Law.

What this Court has held in Nanayakkara Vs. Institute of Chartered

Accountants of Sri Lanka 1981(2) SLR 52, a judgment relied upon by the

Petitioner, is that though there is a master and servant relationship

between the Parties, the relevant regulations had been made by the

relevant Council by virtue of Statutory power given to it under the statute

creating the said institute.

However in the instant case the Petitioner has not shown to the

satisfaction of this Court that any of the Respondents in this case at this

instance was acting under any statutory power. Further, examination of

sections of this particular Act shows that no such statutory power has been

entrusted to any of the Respondents to do any act which is capable of

determining any rights as such of the Petitioner.

The esseFltial requirement of presence of a Public element for Judicial

Review, has been referred to, in the case of Rev. Keselwatugoda

Chandananda Thero Vs. Rev. Sirimalwatte Ananda Mahanayaka Thero and

others [1996 (2) S L R 287], in the following quotation the court has cited

in that case. "Decisions of leaders of particular faiths on disciplinary issues

."

10

are also, as authorities stand, not judicially reviewable. That is because

there is no sufficient public element and no statutory underpinning. II De

Smith -Judicial Review of Administrative Action; 5th Edition; Page

186 ,which this Court had adopted in that case.

Further, Section 12 of Board of Trustees of the Baghawan Sri Sathya Sai

Central Trust of Sri Lanka (Incorporation) Act No. 38 of 2007, states that

nothing contained in this Act shall prejudice or affect the rights of the

Republic or of any body politic or corporate or of any other persons. This

also demonstrates the non-public nature of the provisions of this Act.

The case of Saheer v. Board of Governor of the Zahira College 2002 (3)

SLR 405 relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in his

written submissions has been decided on the basis that the Board of

Governors is amenable to writ Jurisdiction since the Board of Governors is

bound by the regulations made by the Minister of Education under section

37 of the Education Ordinance. That is clear from the following excerpt

from that judgment.

" ....... Mr. Gunasekera invited attention of Court to the regulations made by

the Minister of Education under section 37 of the Education ordinance. The

said regulations required all assisted schools and unaided schools to

conform to requirements stated therein in regard to the qualifications,

apPointments, etc., of teachers and provided that teachers who do not

conform to the conditions stipulated in the said regulations and who are

11

already in service to obtain the approval of the Minister to continue in

service. The regulations made it obligatory for the management of such

schools to make the requisite applications to the Minister. The argument

that the petitioners as parents of students at Zahira College enjoyed

nothing more than the contractual relationship is therefore without merit.

II

It could therefore be seen that the Petitioner cannot get any support from

the judgments he had relied upon.

Further The Petitioner himself admits in his Petition that he tendered his

resignation on 12.03.2009. He had sought to withdraw his resignation by a

letter dated 2009-11-10. It was by letter dated 2014-09-30 (P 05) that the

3rd Respondent had informed him that he has not been removed but that

the trust has acted on the basis of his resignation. The Petitioner had filed

the instant application on 12.03.2015.

The inference that this Court can come to, from the above facts is that the

Petitioner has made an unsuccessful attempt to seek the intervention of

this Court almost 06 years after his resignation. This fact also has to be

held against the Petitioner as it has amounted to an undue delay.

The petitioner has failed to establish that a public functionary has violated

any of his legally protectable rights, it is therefore the view of this court

. -

0 -

12

that Writ jurisdiction of this court cannot be made available either to issue

a writ of certiorari to quash the decisions contained in the document

marked P 05 or to issue a writ of Mandamus to compel the Respondents to

recognize the Petitioner as a member of the board of trustees.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the 1st - 5th, ih - lth & 14th

Respondents also took up the position that the proper course of action that

would have been invoked by the Petitioner, would be under the Trust

Ordinance under Section 101 and, or section 102 of the Trust Ordinance in

order to have this matter resolved. It could therefore be seen that the

remedy to resolve the petitioner's dispute lies elsewhere.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we decide to refuse

this application with costs.
