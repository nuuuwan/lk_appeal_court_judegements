P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal lies against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 08.09.2011, for

having refused the application of the Petitioner-

Appellant for an Issuance of a mandate In -the nature

of a writ of Certiorari to quash the order of the

2nd Respondent, and to make order conlpelling the

2 nd Respondent to hold a proper inquiry regarding

the application of the Petitioner - Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge has refused the said

Application of the Petitioner - Appellant by the afore

said impugned order. Being aggrieved by the said

order the Petitioner has appealed to this Court to

have the said order set aside or vacate.

2

-. The following facts surfaced from the petition of

appeal;

That the Petitioner - Appellant IS the owner of the

paddy land known as Aluthwewamulana containing in

exten t A 1-R 1-PO. In proof of the above, the documen t

marked PI IS tendered, deemed to be the extract

from the Agricultural Land Register.

That the 1 st Respondent had claimed the anda rights

from the Petitioner - Appellant.

That the 1st Respondent on 29.11.2009 made a

complaint under No. HAj04jMISSALANIOUSj 2008, to

the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development of

Hambantota, that he IS the tenant cultivator of the

disputed land and therefore to take necessary steps

to protect his rights;

inquiry was held and it was decided

Respondent IS the tenant cultivator of

land and the Petitioner- Appellant should

Thereupon an

that the 1st

the subject

not disturbed the rights of the 1st Respondent. The

said order is marked as PSA.

In the said backdrop the Petitioner - Appellant had

invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

for an Issuance of a writ of Certiorari to quash the

said decision of the 2nd Respondent.

It IS further contended by the Petitioner - Appellant,

that he was not afforded an opportunity to

participate at the inquiry, and therefore the said

inquiry was held in violation of the rules of natural

justice.

The Learned High Court Judge after taking In to

consideration, the facts placed by both parties has

handed down the above impugned order, dated

08.09.2011, and dismissed petition accordingly.

The core Issue to be determined In the instant,

matter was raised by the 2nd Respondent, that

As per Article 154 (p)(4)(2) of the 13th Amendment to

the constitution, the Provincial High Courts are vested

with the writ jurisdiction;

As per above Article the High Court of Province

could exercise the said power against any officer who

IS exerCIsIng his powers within the province;

That in the instant matter the Assistant Commissioner

of Agrarian Developmen t exerCISIng his powers In

terms of Section 38(5) of the Agrarian Development

Act No.46 of 2000, as the Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development, and therefore the Commissioner

General exercises his powers island wide, and as such

any relief sought against him should be In the

Appellate Court and not In the Provincial High Court.

The core Issue In the instant application IS that to

decide whether

determination made, b f t y way 0 awn.

in terms of the sections of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000.

Article 154 (p)(4) of the 13TH Amendment to the

Constitution provides thus;

Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to

Issue, according to law;

a. Orders In the nature of Habeas Corpus, In

respect of a persons illegally detained within the

prOVInce AND

b.ORDER In the nature of writs of Certiorari,

Prohibition, Procedendo, mandamus and Quo

Warranto against any person exercISIng, within the

Province, any power under;

1. Any law; or

2. Any statues made by the Provincial Council

established for that prOVInce

In respect of any matter set out In the Provincial

Council list.

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that that the

Provincial High Court IS empowered to Issue' an order

in the nature of a writ only on matters arISIng

within the prOVInce In respect of any matter comIng

within the Provincial list.

It IS also to be noted that the High Court of

Province IS empowered to Issue writs In respect of

. '. Judge has dismissed the petition of the Petitioner-

Appellant on the basis that the High Court of

Province, stands den uded of jurisdiction to Issue a

writ, SInce the same has observed and atlirmed and

gIven the following interpretation In the case of

wijesuriya .vs. Nimalawathi Wanigasinghe (S.C.Appeal No.

33/2007).

"While 'within' may glVe nse to mUltiple interpretations

the only reasonable in terpretation

and purpose

in the ligh t of the

of Article 154(P)(4)(b) legislative

and In

history

deed the 13th Amendment as a whole, IS

that it refers to that qualitative nature and scope of

the power at issue and not necessarily the geographic

location of the person who exercised it. In other

words the question that this 'within' .icqulieiiJ.el~t kd.J8

us to determine IS whether the power at Issue IS

one exercised from or as part

authority or position?, and the

and conclusive determination IS

of a curren tly acting

only logical, reasonable

that it IS exercised

from a centrally acting authority or position" (emphasis

added).

Hence In the above in terpretation of the exercIsIng

the powers 'within' means IS 'as part of ,a centrally

acting authority or position'.

Thus for the above compelling reasons I am of the

VIew that the Learned High Court Judge has arrived

at a correct determination and as such ~ I ~old' /1
