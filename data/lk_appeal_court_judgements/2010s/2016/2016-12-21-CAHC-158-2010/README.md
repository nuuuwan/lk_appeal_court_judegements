The accused appellant was charged under three counts namely 54

(A) (b), 54 (A) (c) and 54 (A) (d) of Act no. 13 of 1984 and convicted for

all three charges and convicted for life imprisonment by the High Court of

Vavuniya on 12/11/2010. This appeal is filed against the said conviction

and the sentence.

The only ground of argument of the learned counsel for the

appellant was that the learned High Court Judge has not evaluated and

analysed the evidence placed before court. He stated the High Court

Judge failed to consider the evidence given by the accused appellant and

to apply the principle of consistency and probability. The counsel for the

appellant submitted that the learned High Court Judge has only referred

2

to the cross examination of the appellant and thereafter and referred to

some decided cases.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent submitted

that the learned High Court Judge has analysed the evidence and applied

the test of probability when analyising witness Ebert Silva's evidence and

referred to page 220 of the judgment.

It was held in Jagathsena and others vs G.D.D. Perera

Inspector, Criminal Investigation Department and Mrs. Sirimavo

Bandaranayake 19921 SLR 371. That,

"Although the findings of a Magistrates on questions of fact are

entitled to great weight, yet it is the duty of the Appellate Court to test both

intrinsically and extrinsically, the evidence led at the trial". Therefore we

proceed to analyse the evidence placed before the High Court.

On perusal of the evidence of the main witness Ebert Silva who

made the detection we find that his evidence poses the test of probability,

moreover we find that his evidence is consistent. There are no

contradictions marked per-say.

On perusal of the judgment the High Court Judge has referred to a

number of decided case and we find that he was mindful of the legal

principles that has to be applied to evaluate the evidence of a witness.

The appellant's counsel in his argument referred to P 225 of the brief and

submitted that the learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the

evidence given by the accused appellant which amounts to a substantive

miscarriage of justice.

Once again applying the rule in Jagathsena's case we proceed to

analyse the evidence of the accused appellant. The accused has said out

of the 14 people detained by the Navy with him only he was arrested and

handed over to the police. He refers to some officers as "they" and goes

on to say that the officers did not have any grudge against him and that

he has not seen them before. He has denied the possession of the bag

in which the heroin was found. He refers to a green coloured bag but the

bag marked by witness Ebert Silva is a blue coloured bag. The defence

counsel failed to suggest to the main witness that the bag found in the

possession of the accused appellant was green in colour and not blue.

Therefore we find that the story of the defence is not consistent. Accused

appellant by giving evidence has failed to cast a doubt on the prosecution

evidence.

For the afore stated reasons we find that there is no basis to set

aside the judgment delivered by the High Court Judge of Vavuniya. We

affirm the judgment and conviction dated 12/11/2010 and dismiss the

appeal.
