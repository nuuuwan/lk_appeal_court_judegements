application Dudley Jayasundera after the refusal of the prevIOUS

application by this Court. However, in a recent decision by this Court in

case No. 187/2016 Dilmi Kasundara Malshani Sooriyaarachchi vs. Sri

Lanka Medical Council and others Court Appeal minute dated

10.05.2016 this Court had conduded, based on the Divisional Bench

decision in C.A. Writ Application No.586/2007 reported in 2012 BLR

page 310 that the Court of Appeal Rules of 1990 had not provided for

intervention by the intervenient parties. Therefore, an application for

intervention cannot be granted by the Court of Appeal. In following the

said decision this Court decides to refuse the application for

intervention made by the intervenient petitioner in this case. Application

for intervention is refused.

As the three writ applications can now be fIxed for argument, we

decide to send these applications before Court No.206 to fIx a date for

argument since all these three applications are filed in the year 2013.

Mention In Court No. 206 on 31.10.2016 for fIx a date for

argument.
