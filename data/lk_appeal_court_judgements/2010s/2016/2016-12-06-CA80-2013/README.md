P.R. Walgama, J

The Accused appealed against the capital conviction,

wherein 1n he was sentenced to death, for the charge of

murder of his wife.

The evidence surfaced at the trial, it 1S salient to

mention that this case purely rests on circumstantial

evidence. Therefore it is incumbent on this court to note

2

how the Learned Trial Judge has evaluated the evidence

though not direct, 1n arnv1ng at the determination to

convict the Accused - Appellant for the charge of murder

1n terms of Section 294 of the Penal Code and directed

a sentence of death penalty, in terms of Section 296 of

the Penal Code.

In so far as the case for the prosecution 1S concerned

the Learned high Court Judge has adverted court to the

following;

That on this day in question the Accused - Appellant had

gone to the house of the prosecution witness at or

about 5.30 to 6.00 p.m and had asked her to keep their

child with her, and when asked where his wife the

accused supposed to have had said that she had gone

to the police station. Surprisingly there after Accused-

Appellant had never returned to take the child home.

At about 8.30 p.m. the Accused - Appellant had made a

complaint to the police regarding the wife's body lying

near the house, and the Police had accompanied him to

the place where the body of the deceased was. The

deceased was found 1n a pool of blood and with bleeding

injury at the back of her head. It is also to be noted

that in pursuant to a section 27 statement made by the

Accused - Appellant a mamoty was recovered.

The post mortem report reveals three 1nJunes on the

deceased. One was a cut injury which was found on the

back of the neck.

It IS also apposite to note the behaviour of the Accused-

Appellant, from the time he left the child with the above

witness, and the way In which he found the dead body

of his wife.

According to the witness No.1 the Accused - Appellant had

left the child with her saying that his wife the deceased

went to the Police Station and had left the house of

the witness. But never returned to take the child home.

On the other hand if his version was that the wife the

deceased went to the police station what made him to

look for his wife else where.

It IS also to be noted that the mamoty was recovered

as a result of the statement made by the Accused-

Appellant. The said mamoty was covered with human blood

and human hair. The hair that was taken from the back

of the head of the deceased and the hair taken from

the mamoty was compatible. Further it IS of vital

importance to consider how he had the knowledge as to

the location of the body of the deceased and the location

of the mamoty. It is apparent that in the course of the

investigation the police was able to recover the mamoty

due the directions given by the Accused - Appellant. It IS

salient to note that the house key was with the Accused

- Appellant and non other than the Accused can enter the

house to take the mamoty and commit the alleged crime

and keep the mamoty behind the door. This arouses a

4

very strong probability as to the Accused - Appellant'

involvement in the commission of the cnme.

It IS the contention of the Counsel for the Respondent

that the above facts were within the knowledge of the

Accused - Appellant and he should proffer an explanation

as to the above facts, as per Section 106 of the

Evidence Ordinance. To buttress the above position the

Counsel for the Respondent had cited the case of

SOMARATNE RAJAPAKSA .VS. AG (SC AP 2/02) wherein it

was held that "the failure of the accused to explain the

incriminating circumstantial evidence against him upon the

Lord Ellen borough dictum and came to the conclusion

that there IS no principle In the law which precludes a

conviction In a criminal case being based entirely on

circumstan tial evidence and the fact that the accused

failed to offer any explanation". (emphasis added)

Further the counsel for the Respondent has adverted this

court to the case of DON SHAMANTHA JUDE ANTHONY

JAYAMAHA .VS. AG (Royal Park case) has held thus;

"in order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence

the JUry must be satisfied that the evidence was

consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent

with any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence."

Therefore the attended circumstances stated herein before

this court is of the view that the prosecution has proved

the charge against the

reasonable doubt, and the

Accused - Appellant beyond

Learned High Court Judge has

5

evaluated the evidence in the correct perspective In arnvlng

at the above determination.

In the circumstances attended thereto this court is of the

View that same does not warrant an interference by this

court to vary the conviction and the sentence.

Hence we affirm the conviction accordingly.

Appeal dismissed.
