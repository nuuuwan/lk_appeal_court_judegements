JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Petitioner in this proceedings claims,

i. that he was issued with a permit under Section 19 (2) of the Land

Development Ordinance on or around 2008-01-09

ii. that at the instance of the 1st Respondent, the 4th Respondent was

also issued a permit authorizing the 4th Respondent to occupy an

extent of 20 perch block from the same land that was given to the

petitioner by virtue of the permit marked P 3

iii. that in terms of clause 115 of the orders made under the Land

Development Ordinance (published in the land manual) a sub division

of irrigated land cannot be less than 1 1/2 acres and hence it is not

open for the Respondents to sub divide a small portion from his land

to be given away to the 4th Respondent.

The Petitioner for the above reasons seeks a mandate in the nature of a

writ of Certiorari to quash the permit issued to the 4th Respondent in

5

respect of the portion in the land depicted as lot A 1433 in the plan

marked P 8.

The permit marked P 3 clearly shows that what has been given to the

Petitioner is only a portion of lot A 1433.

From the document marked and produced as lR 2 and lR 3 it could be

clearly seen that the whole land is marked as lot A 1433 and that the

extent given to the petitioner is only 0.790 hectares out of the total extent

of 0.859 hectares.

It could also be seen from the documents marked and produced as 4 Rl

which is the permit issued to the 4th Respondent, 4 R3 and 4 R4. that the

land that has been given to the 4th Respondent clearly is another portion

of lot A 1433 which is in extent of 0.040 hectares.

It cannot be disputed in view of the documents filed by the petitioner as

well as by the Respondents in particular 4 R2 dated 1986-03-18 that the

. 4th Respondent had also been in occupation in the land that had been

given to him. Indeed in paragraph 5 of the petition, the Petitioner also

admits that the 4th Respondent had been in occupation at the time the

6

Petitioner was handed over the possession of the said land. Thus this fact

could be treated as an undisputed fact.

It could also be seen that clause 115 of the land manual refers to a sub

division of a land given on a permit under the Land Development

Ordinance and the said clause is not applicable to this instance as the land

given to the 4th Respondent is not a sub division of the land given to the

Petitioner. These two blocks of lands are completely separate lands which

the petitioner and the 4th Respondent had been occupying and cultivating

even prior to the year 1984.

In view of the above facts the position taken up by the Petitioner that a

portion from his land has been given to the 4th Respondent by another

permit is not factually correct.

In these circumstances we see no merit in this application. Hence we

refuse it and proceed to dismiss the same. However we make no order for

costs.

7

Application is dismissed without costs.
