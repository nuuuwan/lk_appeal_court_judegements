This is a Revision Application against the Judgment of the High Court

of Badulla dated 18th October 2011, made in respect of an Order by the

4

learned Magistrate of Badulla (in Case No. 8961) pursuant to an application

filed by the Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 1 st Respondent) under Section 33 (1) of the Agrarian Development Act

No. 46 of 2000.

Proceedings were instituted on the 01 st of July 2009 by the 1st

Respondent before the Magistrate of Badulla in terms of Section 33(1) of

the Agrarian Development Act, against the Respondent - Petitioner -

Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) alleging that the

Petitioner has filled a paddy land (10 perches in extent) without prior

approval of the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development.

After an inquiry the learned Magistrate determining that an act has

been committed in contravention of Section 33( 1) by the Petitioner,

delivered the Order on 03.01.2008, restraining the Petitioner, his servants

and agents from doing any act in contravention of Section 33 (1).

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate, the

Petitioner preferred a Revision Application to the High Court of the

Province seeking to set aside the said Order of the learned Magistrate.

The learned High Court Judge affirmed the Order of the learned

Magistrate and dismissed the Petition. Being aggrieved by the said

Judgment, the Petitioner has preferred this application seeking to revise it.

The Petitioner seeks to have the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge and the Order of the learned Magistrate, set aside on the basis of I

several grounds set out in Para 11 (a) - U) of the Petition filed in this Court. I

When the 1 st Respondent instituted the Action (M C No.8961) before

the Magistrate of Badulla, under Section 33 (1) of the Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act)

against the Petitioner, it was the contention of the Petitioner, that the subject

matter of the application is not a paddy land; it is a high land. But after an

inquiry the learned Magistrate rejected the contention of the Petitioner and

made an Order in favour of the 1 st Respondent. It is to be noted that the

learned High Court Judge affirmed the Order made by the learned

Magistrate.

When this case was taken up for argument the learned State Counsel

raised two preliminary objections on the maintainability of this application

before considering the merits of the case. However both parties agreed to

argue and consider the preliminary issues and the merits of the case together.

The learned State Counsel raised the following preliminary objections on the

maintainability of this application.

i) The Petitioner has not pleaded or established any exceptional

circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary powers.

ii) There is a delay and / or laches on the part of the Petitioner in

that the Order of the learned High Court Judge sought to be

challenged by these proceedings is dated 18.10.2011 and this

application has been filed on or about 02.05.2013, over twenty

months later.

Firstly, I will consider the preliminary objections raised by the learned

State Counsel. As set out before, the first preliminary objection is the

6

Petitioner has not pleaded or established any exceptional circumstances for

the exercise of the power of revision.

It is the contention of the learned State Counsel that since the

Petitioner has not pleaded or established any exceptional circumstances in

this case, the Petitioner cannot maintain this action. To support her

contention the learned State Counsel relied on the following decided cases:

i) Bank of Ceylon vs.Kaleel and Others, (2004) 1 S.L.R. 284;

ii) Rustom vs. Hapangama and Company (1978 - 79) 2 S.L.R.

225;

iii) Warapragasam and Another vs. Emmanuel C.A. 931 / 88 D.C.

Jaffna 47721L C.A.M. 24.07.1991.

iv) Caderamanpulle vs Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd.(2001) 3 S.L.R.

112.

v) Dharmaratne vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. (2003) 3 S.L.R.

24.

In the written submissions filed in this Court by the Petitioner it was

contended that having declared that this land is a paddy field, he cannot use

the said land for any purpose which has caused grave miscarriage of justice

to him and the said ground mentioned above is an exceptional circumstance

as irreparable loss and damaged has been caused.

At this juncture it is relevant to note that, the 1 st Respondent instituted

proceedings against the Petitioner alleging that, the Petitioner has filled a

paddy land without prior approval of the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development. Since the Court has decided, the land is a paddy land and, if

the Petitioner needs to use it for some other purpose or fill the land he can do

JI !I IIIIi

7

so after obtaining the prior approval from the Commissioner General of

Agrarian Development. Then it will not cause any miscarriage of justice to

him.

Hence, I disagree with the submissions made by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner, that the averments in Paragraph 11

(d) - U) do not constitute exceptional circumstances on the face of it.

The trend of authority clearly indicates that the revisionary powers of

the Court of Appeal will be exercised if the exceptional circumstances exist

only.

In Attorney General vs. Podisingho 51 N.L.R.385, it was held, an

application in revision should not be entertained save in exceptional

circumstances; such as,

(a) Where there has been a miscarriage of justice;

(b) when a strong case for the Supreme Court has been made out by

the Petitioner;

(c) when the applicant was unaware of the order made by the Court of

Trial.

The object of the power of revision as stated by Sansoni Chief Justice

In Mariam Beebee vs. Seyed Mohamed 68 N.L.R 36 is the due

administration of justice "The Court will not hesitate to use its revisionary

powers to give relief where a miscarriage of justice has occurred". (In the

words of Soza J. in Somawathie vs. Madawala and Others 1983 (2) SLR 15).

In Atukorale vs. Saminathan 41 N.L.R. 165 Soertsz J. stated, that the

right of the Court to revise any order made by an original Court will be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances.

Furthermore, in Dharmarathne and Another vs. Palm Paradise

Cabanas Ltd; (2003) 3 S L R 24, Gamini Amaratunga 1. stated, that the

practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional circumstances for

the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got

hardened into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed.

On a consideration of the above authorities, it is abundantly clear, the

revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal will be exercised if the

exceptional circumstances exist only. Thus, the existence of exceptional

circumstances is a process by which the method of rectification should be

adopted.

The 2nd preliminary objection is namely undue delay in filing this

application.

In the written submissions filed in this Court by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner, it was contended that the Petitioner

was compelled to file the revision application as his appeal was dismissed

purely on a technical ground that it was out of time. The learned State

Counsel contended that, if the Petitioner had exercised due diligence while

exercising the statutory right of appeal he should have filed the Appeal

within the prescribed time period as per the Rules. She has further

contended that, the Petitioner's negligence led to the filing of belated appeal

and getting the same dismissed from the Court of Appeal. It is the

contention of the learned State Counsel that although the Petitioner resorted

9

to filing this reVISIon application avernng that there were exceptional

circumstances but he had failed to disclose one such exceptional

circumstance.

It is to be noted that although the Petitioner has stated in Paragraph 14

of his Petition that the Appeal was dismissed on technical ground, the date

of the dismissal is not mentioned. Even a copy of the Order of dismissal is

not filed along with the Petition. However this revision application has been

filed after 20 months from the Order of the learned High Court Judge and it

is to be noted that the Appeal was rejected, due to the Petitioner's own delay

and fault.

In the case of Attorney General vs. Kunchihambu 46 N.L.R. 401, it

was held the delay of three months was to disentitle the Petitioner for relief

In Camillus Ignatious vs. Officer in Charge of Uhana Police Station (Rev)

C.A. 907/89 M.C. Ampara 2587 held that, a mere delay of four months in

filing a revision application was fatal to the prosecution of the revision

application before the Court of Appeal.

The Petitioner has filed this application after 20 months from the

Order of the High Court. In Dissanayake vs. Fernando 71 N.L.R. 356, it was

held, it is essential that the reason for the delay in seeking relief should be

set out in the Petition. The inordinate delay has not been explained by the

Petitioner to the satisfaction of this Court. Accordingly, the long period of

inaction and failure to seek relief on the part of the Petitioner was fatal to an

application in revision.

It is relevant to note that the Petitioner had not filed along with his

Petition, the documents marked by the 1 st Respondent in the case No. 78784

of Badulla Magistrate's Court. The documents which had been marked as X

and X 5 by the 1 st Respondent are vital documents to arrive at a correct

adjudication on the main issue of this case. The 1 st Respondent has filed

copies of the said documents marked as X and X 2. Hence, it is to be noted,

that the appeal brief of P H C 172 - 2010 does not contain copies of all the

marked documents filed in the two cases in the Magistrate's Court of

Badulla.

Accordingly, the Petitioner has not complied with Rule 46 of the

Supreme Court Rules 1978 and has suppressed from this Court some

essential materials. It is to be noted the materials filed by the 1 st Respondent

is in, support of his own case and is in no way intended to supplement the

Petitioner's case or to make good any omissions on the part of the Petitioner.

Due to the aforesaid reasons, this Court has no alternative but to

conclude that the Petitioner failed to substantiate presence of exceptional

circumstances by way of illegality or error on the face of the record.

Accordingly his plea for invoking of the discretionary revisionary powers of

this Court must necessarily fail.

The long period of inaction and failure to seek relief on the part of the

Petitioner was fatal to an application in revision.

Taking into consideration the entirety of the submissions adduced by

both parties, this Court upholds the preliminary objections raised by the 1st

Respondent and conclude that this is not a fit and proper case to invoke the

discretionary revisionary powers of this Court.

Without prejudice to the above views, now I consider the submissions

made by both parties with regard to the main issue of this application.

J I I

11

In this application, the pivotal question to be determined is whether

the subject matter of the application filed in the Magistrate's Court is a

paddy land or a high land.

When this application was taken up for argument, it was the stance of

the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that, it is not a paddy land

within the meaning of Section 101 of the said Act. In the written

submissions filed in this court by the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner, it is contended to complain that in filling a paddy land the

Commissioner shall satisfy that it is a land within the meaning of Section 29

(1) of the said Act. It is further contended, in the instant case, there is

neither any such ascertainment nor any evidence of committing any act of

filling before the learned Magistrate and the 1 st Respondent was totally

relying on preclusive Clause of Section 33(7).

Section 33 (7) reads as follows:

"Court shall not be competent to call for any evidence from the

Commissioner General or Additional Commissioner General or

Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner In

support of the application".

A plain reading of this Section makes it abundantly clear that the

Court has no authority to call for any evidence, neither the 1 st Respondent.

However, since the Petitioner was entitled to give evidence and call the

witnesses, he himself has given evidence and summoned witnesses to give

evidence on behalf of him.

t , r I I

12

It is the contention of the 1 st Respondent that, the evidence elicited

before the Magistrate's Court is sufficient to establish that the subject land

has always existed as a paddy land.

On perusal of the evidence led before the learned Magistrate and the

documents marked by both parties, I am of the view, that the learned

Magistrate, after due consideration of the evidence and documents had come

to the correct findings that, the land in question was a paddy land subject to

filling without a written permit by the 1 st Respondent.

Even though the Petitioner claims that the land in question is not a

paddy land there is no evidence to support his fact.

In the course of the hearing in this Court, the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioner sought to impress upon Court that the learned

Magistrate has made his Order erroneously without considering the evidence

led by the Petitioner. I am unable to agree with the submissions made by the

learned President's Counsel in the light of the above reasoning.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the learned Magistrate's

Order is correct and as such there is no reason to set aside the Order.

Therefore it is not necessary to interfere with the Judgment of the learned

High Court Judge, who affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, no ground exists which justifies the intervention of this

Court to set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 25.08.2010 and

the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 18.10.2011.

For the above reasons I hold that there is no merit in this application

and I dismiss it with costs.
