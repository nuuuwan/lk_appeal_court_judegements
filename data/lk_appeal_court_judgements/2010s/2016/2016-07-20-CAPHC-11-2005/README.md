The instant appeal falls to be determined the accuracy

and legality of the order of the Learned Magistrate,

dated 09.01.2003, and the order of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 01.07.2004.

The instant appeal refers to an order made under

Section 425 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which

states thus;

425(1)

"when an inquiry or trial

concluded the court may

The Accused -Appellant was charged 1n the Magistrate

Court of Tambuthegama for an offence punishable under

Section 403 of the Penal Code for cheating the

Plaintiff for sum of Rs. 9,90,000/-, by pay1ng the

Plaintiff only Rs. 10,000/- when 1n fact the value of

the said lottery was Rs. 10,000,000/-, and alternatively

was charged for criminal misappropriation of the said

amount.

After the conclusion of trial the Learned Magistrate

convicted the Accused - Appellant of the said charges and

imposed the sentence on 1998.02.29. Being aggrieved by

the said order of the Learned Magistrate, the Accused

-Appellant moved the High Court holden at

Anuradhapura to have the conviction and sentence set

aside.

The Learned High Court Judge has acquitted the

Accused - Appellant 1n the case bearing No. 04/98, a

copy of which is marked as P2.

Pursuant to the said acquittal of the Accused - Appellant

an application has been made for the release of the

items In terms of Section 425 of the Criminal

Procedure Code. After the said . . the Learned lnqulry

Magistrate has release the money In lssue to the

Plain tiff - 2ND Respondent accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Accused-

Appellant has appealed to this Court to have the said

impugned order set aside / vacate.

The Learned High Court Judge has observed that the

Learned Magistrate commented on the fact that the

Learned Magistrate has decided to release the money to

the Plaintiff- 2nd Respondent after due consideration of

the evidence and documents produced by the Plaintiff,

which are marked as PI and P2.

There fore the Learned High Court Judge was of the

Vlew that the Learned Magistrate has arrived at the

said determination In the correct perspective and has

concluded that the necessity has not arisen to vary or

set aside the same.

In addition to the stated above the Learned High

Court Judge has also observed the fact that the

Accused - Appellant has not tendered the necessary

documents vis-a vis the plaint, charge sheet, Pland P2.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge, the Accused - Appellant had appealed to

this Court to have said order set aside / vacate.

It 1S seen from the submissions tendered by the

Accused - Appellant, the grounds for appeal as stated in

the petition, among other grounds has specially pleaded

the fact that the inquiry held under Section 425 of

the Criminal Procedure Code by the Learned Magistrate,

1S null and void as the Learned Magistrate has

released the money 1n 1ssue to the Plaintiff - 2nd

Respondent, before the said inquiry was held.

The thrust of the submission of the Counsel was that

the Accused - Appellant has failed to tender the entire

case record of the HC appeal No. 4/98, and the

Revision Application 13/99, and also the documents

marked PI, and P2.

Further it 1S submitted by the Counsel for the 2nd

Respondent that the Appellant has failed to tender the

documents marked PI and P2 even 1n the reV1SlOn

application to the High Court.

It 1S a procedural requirement that 1n an application

1n revision the Rule 3 (l)(b) of Court of Appeal Rules

1990 should apply which states thus;

"Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the

exerC1se of the powers vested 1n the Court of Appeal

by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by

6

r

way of petition, together with an affidavit in support of

the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by

the originals of documents material to such application

(or duly certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits.

Where a petitioner IS unable to tender any such

document, he shall state the reason for such inability

and seek the leave of the Court to furnish such

document later. Where a petitioner fails to comply with

the prOV1SlOns of this rule the Court may ex mero

motu or at the instant of any party, dismiss such

application"

The Rule 3 (1) (b)

"Every application by way of reV1SlOn or restitution In

integrum under Article 138 of the Constitution shall

be made In the like manner together with copIes of

the relevant proceedings

documents produced) In the

(including

Court of

pleadings and

first instance,

tribunal or other institution to which such application

relates"

Therefore on that account alone the counsel for the

2nd Respondent moves for a dismissal of the appeal.

Further it IS noted that the Accused - Appellant was

afforded a fair hearing at the said inquiry before the

Learned Magistrate arrived at the determination that the

Plaintiff- 2nd Respondent IS entitled to the money In

Issue.

Therefore 1n the said back drop this court 1S of the

V1ew that there 1S no reason to set aside or vacate

the orders of the Learned Magistrate and the order of

the Learned High Court Judge as stated above.

Accordingly we dismiss the appeal su bj ect to a cost of

Rs.5000/-

Appeal is dismissed.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
