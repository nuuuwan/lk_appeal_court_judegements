CASE- NO- C.A. 712j97-(F)- JUDGMENT- 18.05.2016

The Plaintiff- Appellant has preferred the instant appeal

against the judgment of the Learned District Judge,

dated 27.05.1997,

the District Court

the Learned High

plaint.

In the case bearing

of Avissawella, by

Court Judge has

No. 644jP In

whkh ju r) errWD t

dismissed the

The Plaintiff- Appellant instituted the above style action

to partition the co owned land more fully described in

the schedule to the plaint.

It IS the position of the Plaintiff- Appellant that the

land sought to be partitioned IS a portion of a

larger land containing in extent one Amuna and eight

lahas, known as ASSWEDDUMAPITA NADE HENYAYA.

It IS the position of the Plaintiff- Appellant that the

suit land is a portion of the said land which was

4

amicably demarcated by the co owners, containing In

extent one and half acres from and out of the

larger land as stated above. But it is salient to note

that the land that was surveyed as the corpus IS a

land containing In extent only 2 roods and 16

perches. Therefore it is abundantly clear that there IS

no proper identification of the corpus, and on that

account alone the Plaintiff's action should fail.

It was the contention of the Plaintiff - Appellant that

the land sough to be partitioned IS registered In

Folio 34/94 at the Kegalle Land Registry. But it is to

be noted that the land registered In the said folio

contains a land In extent one and half acres of

land and not the extent of land of two roods and

16 perches as depicted In the preliminary plan

bearing No. 3755 marked as X. Therefore it IS

pertinent to note that there IS no separate land

possessed by the co owners to the extent stated In

the afore said preliminary plan No.3755, being 1/42

share of the afore said larger land of one Amuna

and eight lahas.

The Learned District Judge has dealt with this Issue

In a light manner and had discussed the devolution

of title at length.

According to the pedigree

the said particular portion

of the Plaintiff - Appellant

of land has been owned

5

and possessed by one Julius, and there by had

acquired prescriptive title to the same.

The said Julius transferred his rights to one

Am balan pitiyage Wije Fernando (3rd Defendant -

Respondent) by Deed of Transfer No. 16784 dated 13th

June 1946).

The said Wije Fernando transferred his rights to his

sister Ambalanpitiyage Kusumalawathi (1 st Defendant-

Respondent) and to Pangukara Devage Karthelis (4th

Defendant - Respondent) by Deed of Transfer No. 25031

dated 13th December 1956 In equal share.

The said Kusumalawathie by Deed of Transfer No.

13532 dated 4th June 1966 transferred 60 sq.ft. area

to the Plaintiff, and the said 4th Defendant transferred

his Y2 to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 19668 dated of

May 1981.

Therefore it was the position of the Substituted

Plaintiff- Appellant that the corpus which IS the

subject matter of this action was possessed by the

Plaintiff, 1st and the 2nd Defendants as a separate

land and therefore the subject land could be

partitioned accordingly.

But the 4b, 4c, 4d and 4e Defendants Respondents

had contended that on a perusal of the relevant

deeds tendered by the plaintiff IS registered In a

different folio D/ 128/ 112 and not the land sought to

6

iI

~f

1?

IIi IIi

~ be partition~~the extent of which 1 Y2 acres. It is also

pertinent to note that there IS no plan made to

depict the 1 Y2 acre land but the afore said plan

marked as X only depicts 2 Roods and 16 Perches.

Further it IS salient to note that there IS no proof

by cogent evidence to established the fact the corpus

was possessed exclusively by the Plaintiff, 1st and 2nd

Defendants.

Besides it IS relevant to note that the 1st and the

~4-,/L 2nd Defendants Jlas not appeakt::t ~gainst the said

impugned judgment of the Learned District Judge of

Avssawella In the above case.

Hence In the said back drop this Court IS of the

view that the said impugned judgment is unattended

In errors.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal, without costs.

Appeal is dismissed.
