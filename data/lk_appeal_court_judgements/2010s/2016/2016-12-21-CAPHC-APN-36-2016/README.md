The Accused Petitioner (the Petitioner) was indicted in the High

Court for offences of trafficking and possession of 01 kg. of cannabis,

violating the provisions of sections 54 A (b) and 54 A (d) of the Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinances as amended punishable under

Column II Part III of the Third Schedule. On his own plea he was

convicted for both offences on 23.12.2015 and on the application of the

Counsel for the Petitioner, the case was postponed till 13.01.2016 for

mitigation and sentence and the Court has called for a finger print report.

On that day the Petitioner was absent and unrepresented, the Court

imposed one year RI for each count in absentia. This revision application

is against the sentence.

The Petitioner states that he was unable to be present before Court

on 13.01.2016 because he has mistakenly taken the date as 26.01.2016.

This cannot be considered as an acceptable excuse for not appearing on

the date fixed for identification and sentence. If the Petitioner was absent

,

on the date fixed for sentencing, Court has no option but to consider that

the Petitioner has nothing to say in mitigation and proceed to impose the

sentence. The learned High Court Judge has correctly done it.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner pleads this Court to vary the

sentence imposed by the High Court by imposing a suspended sentence

considering that he is a young person in the age of twenties and without

having any previous convictions. He further argues in his written

submissions that the maximum sentence that can be imposed on this

charge is one year imprisonment but the Court had imposed two years RI.

The learned DSG submitted that she is not filing any written

submission in this regard and is willing to abide by the order of the Court.

The Petitioner was in possession of one kilogram of cannabis. It is

a commercial quantity. If it was a small quantity, the Court would have

presumed that it was for his consumption, but a large quantity such as one

kilogram cannot be for his personal consumption. Personal consumption

will harm himself and his family. But trafficking dangerous drugs

(Cannabis is categorized as a dangerous drug) will harm the society at

large and it is an offence committed against the entire society. The Court

has to be mindful on this fact when considering the punishment.

On the other hand the Petitioner had pleaded guilty at the first

opportunity. It can be considered that the Petitioner himself is repentance

of what he has done. A person pleads guilty at the first opportunity

deserves a concession.

The petitioner being absent on the day fixed for sentencing, the

Court did not have the privilege of hearing the mitigatory factors. The

Petitioner, though he is a married person with a child, is a relatively

young person in his twenties. This fact is also has to be considered.

The learned Counsel in his written submissions submitted that the

Court has exceeded the maximum punishment prescribed by law by

imposing two years jail term. This submission is incorrect. The Court has

imposed one year jail term for each count aggregating two years. There is

no illegality in the sentence. This Court has to consider the mitigatory

factors only.

The Petitioner is serving the jail term at present. That fact has also

has to be taken in to consideration.

Acting in revision, I vary the sentence as follows.

The Accused Petitioner is sentenced for nine (9) months Rigorous

Imprisonment for the 1 st charge and nine (9) months Rigorous

Imprisonment for the 2nd charge. I further order to run the sentences

concurrently. This sentence is to run from the date of imprisonment.

I agree.
