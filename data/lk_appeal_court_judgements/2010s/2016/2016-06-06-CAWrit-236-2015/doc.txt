JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner in this proceeding is a company which owns a five far

hotel situated in the North Central province. He has prayed in his

petition inter alia,

(i) for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision by the 2nd Respondent (in P 16) to prosecute the , Petitioner in the Magistrate's Court of Kekirawa under the

provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983.

(ii) for a mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition to prohibit the

I

1 st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents from instituting or continuing with

legal proceedings to recover the sum of Rs. 46, 637.50 or any part

thereof under the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12

of 1983 and/or the Industrial Disputes Act

(iii) for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents

from continuing with proceedings instituted in the Magistrate's

court of Kekirawa case No. 12922 / Labour ,

, .

5

(iv) for a writ of Prohibition to prohibit the 1 st,2nd and 3rd Respondents

from taking any action against the Petitioner based on the decision

contained in the document marked P 16 dated 2014-10-13.

When this matter was supported in this court on 2015-06-05 this

court had granted the interim reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner in

terms of prayers (g) (I) of the petition. However, as learned counsel

for the Respondents objected to the extension of the stay order, this

court held an inquiry relating to that issue on 2016-02-24. As the

main issues contested by the respective parties were sufficiently

argued in the course of the submissions made by all the counsel, at

the said inquiry, this court with the concurrence of the counsel

directed that the rest of the pleadings be filed in court and that

thereafter written submissions also be filed to enable this court to

formally conclude the argument of this case. This court also indicated

to the learned counsel for all the parties that it would thereafter take

steps to fix a date to pronounce the judgment in this case. Learned

counsel for all the parties, pursuant to this arrangement, have filed

the relevant papers, after which this court fixed the date to

pronounce the judgment.

,

6

Main complaint of the learned President's Counsel who appeared for

the Petitioner, is that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have not only

failed to inform him of any decision but 'also failed to give reasons for

any such decision which may have been taken at the end of the

inquiry, which he says he attended, as summoned by the 3rd

Respondent by the documents marked P 3, P 6 and P 7.

" It is in this backdrop that the learned President's Counsel appearing

for the Petitioner, sought to argue that P 16 should be quashed by a

writ of Certiorari for the reason that the decision contained therein is

a decision that has been taken arbitrarily and not as pursuant to the

inquiry referred to in the documents marked P 3, P 6 and P 7. It is

on that basis that the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents failed to hold an '

inqUirY'.rhSOf section 8 (1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12

. ~', :

Further, it wasthe position of the Petitioner that he is not liable to

pay gratuity to the 4th Respondent, as an employer becomes liable to

pay gratuity under Section 5 (1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act No.

12 of 1983, only where an employee has "a period of service of not

I tnan five completed yeers" under thelt employer.

7

It would be helpful to start off consideration of the above arguments

by reproducing the relevant parts of section 8 of Payment of Gratuity

Act No. 12 of 1983. They are as follows:

Section 8 (1)

"where any default is made in the payment of any sum due as

gratuity ur1tJer this Act or where the gratuity due under this Act

cannot be recovered under the provisions of section 4 or under the

provisions of sub section 5 of section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act,

the commissioner may issue a certificate after such inquiry as he may

deem necessary, stating the sum due as gratuity and the name and

place of residence of the defaulter to the magistrate having

jurisdiction in the division in which the estate or establishment is

situated. The Magistrate shall, thereupon, summon the defaulter

before him to show cause why further proceedings of the recovery of

the sum due as gratuity under this Act should not be taken against

him and in default of sufficient cause being shown, the sum in default

shall be deemed to be a fine imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate

on such defaulter for an offence punishable with fine only ............ ".

Section 8(2)

8

"The commissioner's certificate shall be prima facie evidence that the

amount due under this Act from the defaulter has been duly

calculated, and that the amount is in default."

Section 8(3J - 8(7J .................. (Not reproduced here)

In order to ascertain the sustainability of the argument that 1st, 2nd

and 3rd R~ondents have failed to hold an inquiry in terms of

section 8 (1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, it is first

necessary to consider as to what extent the Petitioner has got

involved in whatever the type of proceedings had before the 1st, 2nd,

and 3rd Respondents.

The petitioner has, according to paragraph 06 of the petition and its

corresponding averment in the affidavit (paragraph 07), filed by him,

has admitted that he attended the inquiry conducted by the 3rd

Respondent pursuant to the documents marked P 3, P 6 and P 7.

Further, the Petitioner in the same paragraph has also admitted that

he has filed written submissions at the said inquiry conducted by the

3rd Respondent. The Petitioner has even gone on, not only to annex a

copy of the said written submissions to his petition, marked as P 8,

but also the documents he has submitted along with his said written

submissions for the consideration of the 3 rd Respondent marked as 2

9

9, P 10 - P 15. Indeed the parties are not at variance on these

points as the statement of objections of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents too confirm these positions.

It would be in sequence for this court to move next on to consider

the type of statutory obligation wh!ch section 8 of the Act has vested

in the hands of Commissioner of Labour. This aspect has been

discussed by this court in Collettes Ltd Vs Commissioner of Labour

and others!. In that case, the complaint made to the Court of Appeal

by the learned counsel for the Petitioner in that case was that he was

not allowed to lead evidence at the inquiry and that therefore the

Inquiring Officer failed to hold a proper and full inquiry. It was

therefore submitted to court on behalf of the Petitioner in that case

that the order made by the Inquiring Officer under section 8 was not

a valid order in law.

However, the court of Appeal in that case, held

i. that there is no specific requirement that the commissioner

should call evidence.

'1989 (21 SLR 6

10

ii. that all what seems to be necessary is for the commissioner to

be satisfied of the relevant matters necessary to decide on the

question whether a person is entitled to gratuity or not.

iii. that in the circumstances and in the light of the facts of that

case, the Inquiring Officer had made such inquiry as he

deemed necessary, as required by law, before he made his

recommendation to award gratuity.

iv. that therefore there is adequate compliance with the

provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act, and

v. that therefore the conclusion arrived at by the Inquiring

Officer is valid in law.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have adopted a certain procedure to

conduct the inquiry they are required to conduct under Section 8(1) of

the Gratuity Act. The Petitioner states that it is not in conformity with

that provision of law. However the Petitioner has at no stage suggested

or given at least any indication as to what type of procedure he wished

those Respondents should have adopted. The Gratuity Act No 12 of

1983 is silent as to what kind of procedure the Commissioner of Labour

should follow in conducting this type of inquiry. In order to resolve this

issue it is now time to look at two of the decided cases in England.

11

These two cases have featured in a subsequent Privy Council judgment

pertaining to a Sri Lankan case.

The first of those two cases is Russel Vs. Duke of Norfolk and others2.

One of the issues to be decided by the Court of Appeal in England in

that case is whether the inquiry held by the stewards of the Jockey Club

was in accordance with the principles of natural justice. Lord Justice

Tucker while holding that it is a mistake to treat all inquiries as if they

are trials, has stated in his judgment as follows. " ........ Throughout this

inquiry he was, at every stage, it seems to me, given an opportunity of

presenting his case and of asking any questions which he desired to ask.

It is true that he was not in terms asked: "Have you got any witnesses?

Do you want an adjournment? " A layman at an inquiry of this kind is,

of course, at a grave disadvantage compared with a trained advocate,

but that is a necessary result of these domestic tribunals which proceed

in a somewhat informal manner. Counsel for the plaintiff, in the course

of his forceful argument on this pOint, again and again said: "What

would be said of local justices who acted in this way?" With all due

respect, the position is totally different. This matter is not to be judged

by the standards applicable to local justices. Domestic tribunals of this

, (1949) 1 AER 109

12

kind are entitled to act in a way which would not be permissible on the

part of local justices sitting as a court of law ......... 3 "

In the case of Local Government Board Vs Arlidge4 which is the second

of those two cases above mentioned, one of the issues to be decided by

the House of Lords was whether the procedure adopted by the

Appellant in that case which is Local Government Board to determine

the impugned appeal was contrary to the rules of natural justice.

Viscount Haldane L C in the course of his judgment stated as follows. "

........ When the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed, those whose

duty it is to decide it must act judicially. They must deal with the

question referred to them without bias, and they must give to each of

the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made. The

decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of

responsibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice. But it

does not follow that the procedure of every such tribunal must be the

same. In the case of a Court of law tradition in this country has

prescribed certain principles to which in the main the procedure must

confirm. But what the procedure is to be in detail must depend on the

nature of the tribunal. In modern times it has become increasingly

"!It p!lge 117 (1915) A C 120

13

common for Parliament to give an appeal in matters which really pertain

to administration, rather than to the exercise of the judicial functions of

an ordinary Court, to authorities whose functions are administrative and

not in the ordinary sense judicial. Such a body as the Local Government

Board has the duty of enforcing obligations on the individual which are

imposed in the interests of the community. Its character is that of an

organization with executive functions. In this it resembles other great

departments of the state. When, therefore, Parliament entrusts it with

judicial duties, Parliament must be taken, in the absence of any

declaration to the contrary, to have intended it to follow the procedure

which is its own, and is necessary if it is to be capable of doing its work

ffi tl ,,5 e IClen y ........ .

Indeed both these cases above mentioned, have been referred to, by

the Privy council in the case of The University of Colombo Vs E F W

Fernando6 In that case the University of Colombo challenged before the

Privy Council a decision by the Supreme Court declaring the Vice

Chancellor's decision to suspend the Respondent in that case, E F W

Fernando, a student of the University. Clause 8 of the "General Act" No

(lI!lu",.a, en: "ege l~:!

61 NLR 505

14

1 Chapter VIII Part I which prescribed the examination procedure of the

University under which the Vice chancellor acted, is as follows.

"Where the Vice Chancellor is satisfied that any candidate for an

examination has acquired knowledge of the nature or substance of any

question or the content of any paper before the date and time of the

examination, or has attempted or conspired to obtain such knowledge,

the Vice Chancellor may suspend the candidate from the examination or

remove his name from any pass list, and shall report the matter to the

Board of Residence and Discipline for such further action as the Board

may decide to make.7"

The Supreme Court in its judgment8 took the view that the mode of

inquiry adopted by the Vice Chancellor violated the principles of natural

justice and held that the suspension was null and void. However the

Privy Council setting aside the judgment of the Supreme Court took the

view that the question whether the requirements of natural justice have

been met by the procedure adopted in any given case must depend to a

greater extent on the facts and circumstances of the case in point.

'(supre) et page 50S "This judgment Is reported In 51' NLR 265

15

The Privy Council went on to state as follows. " .... Turning now to the

actual terms in which the Vice Chancellor is invested with the quasi-

judicial function here in question, it is to be observed that all that clause

8 provides is that where the Vice Chancellor is satisfied that any

candidate has acquired knowledge of the nature or substance of any

question or the content of any paper before the date and time of the

examination "the Vice Chancellor .... shall report the matter to the Board

of Residence and Discipline .... " The clause is silent as to the

procedure to be followed by the Vice Chancellor in satisfying himself of

the truth or falsity of a given allegation. If the clause contained any

special direction in regard to the steps to be taken by the Vice

Chancellor in the process of satisfying himself he would, of course, be

bound to follow those directions. But as no special form of procedure is

prescribed it is for him to determine the procedure to be followed as he

thinks best, but, to adapt to the present case the language of the

judgment of this Board in De Verteuil V Knaggs9 at page 560, subject to

the obvious implication that some form of inquiry must be made, such

(1918) A. C 557

16

as will enable him fairly to determine whether he should hold himself

satisfied that the charge in question has been made out. ,,10

Towards resolving the issue at hand, the authorities referred to above

make it possible for this court to come to the following inferences. They

are,

1. that the mere presence of the word "inquiry" in a statute does not

necessarily mean that leading oral evidence, subjecting such

witnesses for cross examination etc. must take place.

II. that where the terms of a statute demand that a particular

procedure should be followed, such procedure must be adopted as

the procedure for such inquiry.

III. that where the statute is silent about the procedure to be adopted,

the inquiring body is free to adopt a procedure on its own, but

subject to the condition that the procedure so adopted must

provide adequate opportunity for the party under investigation to

place its case.

IV. the inquiring body must ensure that the rules of natural justice are

observed adequately.

17

V. that where the terms of a statute have identified the scope of the

inquiry, what is expected of the inquiring body is to be mindful of

that scope when conducting that inquiry.

Section 8 (1) of the Act has neither specified nor given any indication

regarding any guideline as to how an inquiry under that section should

be conducted by the Inquiring Officer. Instead the section has given a

discretion for the Inquiring Officer to decide on the scope and the

manner in which it should be conducted. This could be gathered from

the wording" ... as he may deem necessary ... 11".

Indeed it may not be correct to say that the section is silent about the

procedure because of the indication it has given namely the words" ...

as he may deem necessary ... ", as this phrase qualifies the scope of the

inquiry to be conducted. This could have a direct impact on the

procedure to be adopted also.

It has been the approach of our courts to derive some guidelines with

regard to the procedure to be adopted in such situations from the words

of the statute itself. Case of Brown & Company Vs Ratnayake and 3

others12 is a good example in that regard. Petitioner in that case

.. section 8(1) of Gratuity Act No 12 of 1983 .. (1986) Vol. 1 Bal" AssoCletlon Lew Journel Reports Part VI, page 229

18 " challenged befor the Court of Appeal, the decision of the Arbitrator

calling upon him to begin and start leading evidence on his behalf first.

the relevant provision in section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act is to

the effect that" ...... the arbitrator shall make all such inquiries into the

disputes as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as may be

tendered by the parties to the dispute and thereafter make such award

as may appear to him just and equitable ...... " The approach taken by

this court in that case could be gathered by the following quotation from

its judgment in that case. It is as follows. " ..... .It is important to note

that the section enacts that the arbitrator shall make all such inquiries.

The section does not say that the arbitrator shall hold an inquiry. In my

view, the word 'make' is a pOinter to how the inqutry commences. The

word 'make' in my view throws the ball in to his court requiring the

arbitrator to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary ...... ".

Similarly, when one attempts to interpret the wording " ... as he may

deem necessary ... in section 8(1) of the Gratuity Act, the question arises

as to who may deem necessary? The wording II .... the Commissioner

may issue a certificate after such inquiry as he may deem necessary

...... " answers this question beyond any ambiguity. It is none other than

"the Commissiorer".

19

It is common knowledge that in legal practice one must establish the

existence of necessary ingredients if that person expects to prove a legal

liability of another. However in the instant inquiry it has not become

necessary for the Inquiring Officer to go into all of such ingredients

constituting the impugned liability which the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Respondents

would generally have been expected to be satisfied of, in order for them

to come to a conclusion that the Petitioner is liable to pay gratuity to the

4th Respondent. The reason for this is that most of these ingredients

were not in dispute. This is so because the fact that the 4th Respondent

had worked under the Petitioner from time to time has not been

disputed by the Petitioner. The only issue that the Petitioner has

contested is the issue that the 4th Respondent did not have a period of

service not less than five completed years under the Petitioner.

It is in this backdrop that the 3rd Respondent has rightly chosen to focus

on the only contested point, namely whether the 4th Respondent has a

period of service not less than five completed years under the Petitioner.

That is the kind of inquiry that the 3rd Respondent has deemed

necessary under section 8(2) of the Act.

\ I

\

20

~ In these circumstances, task of this court in dealing with an application

for a writ of Certiorari should be, to see whether there has been a

sufficient compliance of section 8 (1) of the Act. Indeed that is exactly

what this court had done in Collettes Ltd Vs Commissioner of Labour and

others13 case also when it held that there is adequate compliance with

the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act

Before this Court could finally answer the above question, it would be

appropriate to deal with the other complaint made by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner. The said complaint is that the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Respondents have failed to give reasons for the findings

arrived after the impugned inquiry.

The document marked R 3 annexed to the statement of objections filed

by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents sheds light on this question. It is

useful at this stage to bear in mind as to why the Petitioner says that he

was affected by the absence of reasons. As mentioned before it is the

contention of the Petitioner that he is not liable to pay gratuity because

the 4th Respondent did not have a period of service not less than five

completed years under the Petitioner. It is therefore the submission of

the Petitioner that the Petitioner cannot and should not become liable to

"(Ibid) at page 13

I t f

\

I 1 I t III ,

I

21

pay gratuity to the 4tftr. Respondent in view of the interpretation given in

section 20 of the Act. It is timely to recall again and bear in mind that

the fact that the 4th Respondent had worked under the Petitioner from

time to time, has been admitted by the Petitioner. As per P 17 this

period is admitted as from November 2006 to February 2011 14 and as

per P 8 it is from January 2007 to February 20 11is.

The above facts show that the scope and the foct:Js of the inquiry by the

3rd Respondent must have been to ascertain whether the 4th Respondent

has had a period of service of not less than five, completed years under

the Petitioner, and that is exactly what the 3rd ~ondent had done in . this case. According to the document marked ~the 2nd Respondent

" '; '.~!' -:' .. : . '. has not only concluded that the 4th Respondegt;.l:entitled to gratuity in : . ', l,;: ,

'. ~:" ::". "., terms of section 8 (1) of the Act, but also has set out the basis upon

which he has come to that conclusion.

In these circumstances this court is of the considered view

1. that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have arrived at the impugned

conclusion after such inquiry as they had deemed necessary.

,. r;. .... 3(8)

11 Under the sub heading "BACKGROUND"

\

Jt

\

22

II. that in conduc~g the said inquiry, the said Respondents had

adequately afforded the Petitioner an opportunity to place his case

before the said Respondents.

III. that therefore the said Respondents have not breached any rule of

natural justice.

IV. that therefore the said Respondents have sufficiently complied

with section 8(1) of the Gratuity Act No 12 of 1983.

Learned President's Counsel while attacking the above conclusion

arrived at by the 3rd Respondent, also contested in this proceedings

before this court, the fact that the 4th Respondent does not have a

period of service of not less than five completed years under the

Petitioner. It was his submission that therefore the Petitioner has faced

a grave injustice.

In view of this submission, the next question that would arise for

consideration before this court, is as to whether this court is in a

position to agree or disagree with the conclusion arrived at by the 3rd

Respondent more fully mentioned in the document marked R 3.

Section 8 (2) of the Act has provided for the steps that the Petitioner

should take when he is placed in this type of situation. The contents of

sectIon 8 (2) clearly points to the fact that It Is not the writ lur\sd\ct\on of

f \

\

t

23

this court that the Petitioner should invoke at this juncture of the

Magistrate's Court Kekirawa case.

Section 8 (2) of the Act states that the Commissioner's certificate shall

be prima facie evidence that the amount due under this Act from the

defaulter has been duly calculated, and that the amount is in default.

In the case of Ex employer Vs Deputy Commissioner of Labour16, the

Supreme Court held that showing cause against the certificates issued

under the Gratuity Act is not limited to showing that the Petitioner was

not the person named as the defaulter in the certificate, that he has

paid the amount specified in the certificate and that he is not resident

within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Co;urt but also extends to

showing that the sums specified in the certificate are not due or that

they. have been incorrectly calculated, because under section 8 (2) of

the Act, the Commissioner's certificate is only prima facie evidence. It is

open to the Petitioner to displace the effect of the prima facie evidence

by offering further evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature.

As referred to above when one looks at the prayers of the Petitioner,

Petitioner has requested this court to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing

1

the decision contained in the document marked P 16 and the decision

"1..991 rl] SLR 222

24

to prosecute the Petitioner in the Magistrate's Court of Kekirawa under

the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act and to issue a writ of

Prohibition prohibiting the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents from instituting

or continuing with proceedings to recover any gratuity payable under

that Act.

If this court is to consider granting these reliefs, this court will have to

first conclude that the Petitioner is not liable to pay gratuity to the 4th

Respondent in terms of the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act

No. 12 of 1983. However it is only through the mechanism that has

been provided for in the Gratuity Act, namely section 8 (2), that the

conclusion above referred to, could be arrived at. This is so because the

Petitioner and the 4th Respondent are at loggerheads on major ground of

fact.

This court in Thajudeen Vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another17 , held

that the most appropriate procedure for the settlement of a dispute

when major grounds of facts are being disputed by parties is the

proceedings by way of regular procedure before the appropriate court of

first instance. Such an action would not only be equally convenient,

\? 1981 [2] SLR 471

, 25

beneficial and an equal remedy, but would be the best and the most

effective way to settle that dispute.

As has been mentioned above, the learned President's Counsel made

submissions on the argument that the 4th Respondent does not have a

period of service of not less than five completed years under him, and

hence he is not liable under section 5(1) of the Act to pay gratuity to the

4th Respondent. Although it is not for this court to decide on that issue,

this judgment would not be complete unless this court at least

superficially touch on that issue, as parties have made submissions on

that issue as well.

It will suffice therefore to note that the 4th Respondent has been in

service for 7 years with the Petitioner and that her service has

temporarily ceased only during the months of February and August each

year as a routine practice. Further it should also be noted that according

to section 20 of the Act "completed service" means uninterrupted service

and includes service which is interrupted by approved leave on any

ground whatsoever, a strike or lockout or cessation of work not due to

any fault of the workman concerned.

Therefore the issue to be decided in this case is whether the interruption

of work during the months referred to above Is due to any fault of the

\

J

\I

t

26

4th Respondent or not. This is something that has to be decided by the

Magistrate's Court in the case that has already been filed before it.

Writ jurisdiction of this court is an extraordinary jurisdiction which this

court should exercise when it is really necessary. On the other hand, it is

not open for this court to approbate to itself and assume the jurisdiction

which has been conferred on the Magistrate by the statute. And in any

case one cannot decide this question of fact without holding a proper

inquiry.

Time and again the courts have held that Certiorari being a discretionary

remedy will not ordinarily be granted unless and until other remedies

reasonably available and equally appropriate have been exhausted.

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons this court is of the

view that the 1st , 2nd, and 3rd Respondents have held an inquiry in terms

of section 8( 1) of the Gratuity Act and that the mode they had adopted

for them to be satisfied that a certificate should be filed in the

Magistrate's Court against the Petitioner is a step rightly taken with no

room for the Petitioner to complain regarding any breach of rules of

natural justice.

Hence this court is of the view that there exists no basis for this court to

grant any of the prayers in this application. This application should

therefore stand dismissed. Learned Magistrate of Kekirawa should be

free to continue with the case before it. We make no order with regard

to costs.

Application is refused.
