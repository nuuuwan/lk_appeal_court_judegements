Malinie Gunaratne, J.

A confiscation inquiry had been held by the learned Trial Judge of

Moneragala, regarding the Vehicle (Tractor) No. N C S D 6014 and after

inquiry, by his Order dated 07.05.2013, the learned Trial Judge had ordered

the confiscation of the said vehicle.

Aggrieved by this Order, the Appellant has come before this Court,

seeking to set aside the said Order.

The facts of this Appeal were not disputed and it was a common

ground that W.M.R. Suneth Kumara, U. Nalin Akalanka Wijerathne, W.M.

Chaminda Pushpa Kumara and M.G. Anura Keerthi were indicted by the

State under the provisions of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No.

13 of 1984, (hereinafter referred to as the said Act) for possessing and

trafficking 15.920 kg. of cannabis sativa without a valid permit.

3

The accused were convicted on their own plea by the learned Trial

Judge. Thereafter the learned Trial Judge has proceeded to confiscate the

vehicle No. N C S D 6014, after an inquiry held under Section 79(1) III

terms of the Provisions contained in the said Act.

The learned Trial Judge in his decision has stated that the Appellant

has failed to establish that he had no knowledge as to the commission of the

offence to which the accused had pleaded guilty. Accordingly, the learned

Trial Judge has decided to confiscate the vehicle. Hence, it is necessary to

ascertain whether or not the learned Trial Judge has implemented the law

referred to in Section 79( 1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

(Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.

The aforesaid Section 79 (1) of the said Act reads thus:

79 (1) Where any person is convicted of an offence against the

Ordinance or any regulation made thereunder the Court shall order

that all or any articles in respect of which the offence was committed

and any boat, vessel, vehicle, aircraft or air-borne craft or equipment

which has been used for the conveyance of such article shall, by

reason of such conviction, be forfeited to the State.

A simple reading of the Section clearly shows that the vehicle claimed

by the Appellant is liable to be confiscated since the said vehicle had been

used to commit an offence under the said Act.

The impression that comes to a judicial mind by looking at the

manner, in which those words are being used in Section 79(1) is that it is to

ensure holding of an inquiry by the trial judge before he makes an order.

Then only the trial judge becomes entitled to make an appropriate order.

4

As such, the learned Trial Judge held an inquiry when the Appellant

made an application to have the said vehicle released to him relying upon

Section 79(1) of the said Act. After the inquiry, the learned Trial Judge,

deciding that the Appellant has failed to establish that he had no knowledge

as to the commission of the offence, confiscated the vehicle.

Now it has to be considered whether the learned Trial Judge has

correctly evaluated the available evidence when he decided to confiscate the

vehicle claimed by the Appellant. It is necessary to ascertain whether the

Appellant in this instance was successful in establishing whether he in fact

had no knowledge whatsoever of the Act of illegally transporting cannabis

making use of the vehicle that he owns, on a standard of balance of

probabilities.

When this case was taken up for argument the learned Counsel for the

Appellant contended that, the learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate and

assess the totality of the evidence led at the inquiry. The learned Counsel

further contended that, the learned Trial Judge has considered extraneous

matters that had not been elicited in the evidence.

It is the stance of the learned Additional Solicitor General, as the

Appellant had not proved his case on balance of probability the learned Trial

Judge has correctly made the Order of confiscation of the vehicle.

I will now consider the evidence, which the Appellant had given at the

inquiry. Summarily the relevant evidence is as follows:

"@@ gG) cs:>@t;,:>E) @de)ct) !:Doo>en. Q~t:D()5 6aw a:65000/- t:D E)we,@ !:D6@)

Appellant's aunt also has given evidence at the inquiry.

Having considered the totality of the evidence of both, the learned

Trial Judge had concluded that the Appellant has failed to establish that he

had no knowledge as to the commission of the offence.

I will now look at the evidence of the Appellant to ascertain whether

he has successfully shown valid reasons to establish that he had no

knowledge or participation in the offence.

The Appellant has stated in his evidence in chief that he had no

knowledge of the offence, in one word.

(2) e. el)~e5)~.

It is to be noted that, it is a leading question put to the Appellant by

his Counsel. However is it sufficient for the Appellant merely to say that he

was not aware or that he had any knowledge or participation that the vehicle

was used in the commission of the offence and instructions had been given

to his Aunt not to use the vehicle for illegal purposes? The answer to the

question is purely in the negative. The Appellant cannot escape liability by

stating that he had no knowledge of the offence. He should satisfy the Court

and establish it on a standard of balance of probabilities.

On perusal of the evidence of the Appellant, it is to be noted even

though he has stated that he entrusted the vehicle to his Aunt, he has not

revealed the arrangement that he had made when he entrusted the vehicle to

the Aunt. No evidence is forthcoming to support that he provided a driver,

discussed the method of payments to be charged for hires, how to pay the

purported instalments to the finance company etc. According to his

evidence the Appellant has merely entrusted the vehicle to his Aunt.

It is curious indeed, why the vehicle was entrusted to his Aunt,

although she has two sons. When the said question was asked by Court, the

Appellant has not given an answer.

It was elicited from the Appellant's Aunt's evidence that the vehicle

had been driven by her sons, who are the 1 st and 3 rd Accused of this case.

Even though the Appellant has stated in his evidence that he had given

instructions to the driver not to use the vehicle for illegal purposes, he has

not disclosed or elicited from his evidence who the driver was, or the name

of the driver.

It is to be noted even though the Appellant's Aunt has stated in her

evidence on the date of the commission of the offence that she requested

her two sons (1 st and 3 rd Accused) to go to Anuradhapura and bring some

zinc sheets, the Appellant has not stated a single word about that. When the

7

Courts asked the Appellant without giving the vehicle to his own brothers

who are residing in Kirindiwela, why the vehicle was given to his Aunt, he

has stated "t5)~e)~ eJ006 Q}@~ <5)~e.5)~ g~ g@)~~cl ffi@~eD@eD" It is to be

noted that this answer cannot be accepted.

Further, the evidence of the Appellant is that he bought the vehicle

subject to finance facilities from a finance company. But no evidence is

forthcoming to support the income or profit that he received after entrusting

the vehicle to his Aunt, or how much he paid as the instalment to the

Finance Company.

Accordingly, looking at the said evidence of the Appellant, it is clear

that he has failed to reveal fully, the facts that are necessary to establish

whether he had any idea or knowledge as to the commission of the offence

in this instance. Moreover a reasonable person who owns a vehicle does not

just entrust the vehicle to another person without making proper

arrangements to hire the vehicle for field work and without giving proper

instructi ons.

Under those circumstances, it is my considered VIew that the

Appellant has failed to show that he had no knowledge as to the commission

of this offence under the said Act to which the accused had pleaded guilty.

Neither had he shown any other particular reason to consider in order to

have the vehicle released.

In the above circumstances it is evident that the learned Trial Judge

had not erred when he held that the Appellant had not satisfied Court that he

had no knowledge as to the commission of the offence to which the Accused

had pleaded guilty.

.. 8

On perusal of the Judgment it is apparent, that the evidence has been

evaluated judicially by the learned Trial Judge. As such, I do not see any

wrong in the manner in which the learned Trial Judge has considered the

facts and the way in which he has applied the law in this instance.

F or the above reasons, I see no basis to interfere in the Judgment of

the learned Trial Judge. Accordingly, I affirm the Order dated 07.05.2013

and dismiss the Appeal with costs.
