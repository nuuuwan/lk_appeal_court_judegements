At the conclusion of the trial on the 11th of March 2010, the learned trial

judge found the appellant guilty of Murder punishable under section 296 of

the Penal Code.

Facts of the case are as follows:-

The appellant, 32 year old married labourer had been acquainted with the

deceased who later fallen in love with him. According to the confession it was

revealed that, on the day of the incident the deceased asked the appellant to

many her and an argument ensued as the appellant had refused to leave his

wife and child. Thereafter, the deceased had spoken against the accused

appellant and his mother in a degrading manner upon which the appellant

was provoked and hence reacted by strangling her neck until her body

became lifeless.

When the appellant realized that Bhawani was dead, he had placed a coir

rope around her neck and dragged the body and dumped it in the septic pit.

Appellant removed the jewelry she was wearing which were a chain of V2 ...

sovereign in weight, a pendant with the word "om", a rin~f ~d a pair of gypsy

earrings and hid it.

According to the evidence gIVen by sub-inspector of police Jayaratne, the

appellant Mendis Thilakaraj was arrested on 23.08.2004 and his statement

was recorded on the same day. Appellant stated in his statement that "the

..

dead body dumped by him in the septic pit can now be seen there; he could

show same" The body of the deceased was discovered on the direction of the

appellant and was taken out in the presence of the magistrate.

The body was identified by Letchumanan Neelawathi who was the mother of

the deceased by the clothes found with the body. She had further stated that

3 1/2 sovereign of jewelry which she was wearing were missing. The body

was also identified by the father of the deceased.

The skeleton remains were examined by Professor Niriellage Chandrasiri who

passed away before giving evidence and therefore senior lecturer of forensic

medicine, Muditha Vidana Pathirana had testified on his behalf. He

confirmed that the death was caused by strangling the neck using coir rope.

It was also revealed that the body was of a woman of 5'2" height and 18-20

years of age.

On careful consideration of the above evidence, we are of the view that the

intention to kill the deceased girl was not pre meditated. It is observed that

the prosecution was unable to prove the murderous intention beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore, the conviction for murder cannot stand.

~~ However, it is evident that the death of the deceased was due to

strangulation and it has been caused by the accused appellant.. Learr~ed ASG

who appeared for the Attorney General conceded that the act committed by

(

the accused appellant was due to grave and sudden provocation not

amounting to murder.

Therefore we convict the accused appellant for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder under grave and sudden provocation which is

punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code. We impose a sentence of 20

years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rupees 10 000 with a default

sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment and in addition, compensation

of Rupees 100,000 payable to the victims (parents of the deceased) with a

default sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment. All sentences to run

consecutively. After considering the submissions made on behalf of the

accused-appellant we also direct that the sentence be implemented from the

date of conviction namely 11.03.2010.

Subject to the above mentioned variation, the appeal is hereby dismissed.
