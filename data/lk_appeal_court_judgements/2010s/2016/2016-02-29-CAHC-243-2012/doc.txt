H.N.J. PERERA, J.

Accused-appellant is present in Court on bail.

2nd witness named in the indictment Peragaswattegedara Nensina is present

in Court.

Counsel for the accused-appellant informs Court that the accused-appellant

is prepared to pay a sum of Rs. 300,000/- as the compensation to the said

witness in Open Court. Accused-appellant has been convicted for causing

grievous hurt to the said witness for an offence punishable under Section

317 of the Penal Code and had been sentenced to five years rigorous

imprisonment and to fine of Rs. 5000/- and also had been ordered to pay

Rs. 10,000/- as compensation to the said victim. As the accused-appellant

is prepared to pay Rs. 300,000/- as compensation to the said victim the

learned Counsel for the respondent has no objection in suspending the said

term imposed by the learned trial Judge on the accused-appellant.

Witness No. 2 Peragaswattegedara Nensina informs Court that she has

received Rs. 300,000/- from the accused-appellant in Open Court.

If

Therefore, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of this case

and submissions made by the counsel for the accused-appellant and also

the fact that the accused-appellant had paid Rs. 300,000/-as

compensation to the said victim in this case, we said aside the sentence of

five years rigorous imprisonment imposed by learned High Court Judge on

the accused-appellant and substitute a term of two years rigorous

imprisonment suspended for five years.

The fine imposed by the learned High Court Judge should stand and default

sentence of three years imprisonment. We also order that Rs. 300,000/- be

paid as compensation to the victim of this case. The said amount is paid in

Open Court today. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge is directed to

take steps to recover the said fine of Rs. 5000/- imposed on the accused-

appellant. Subject to the said variation in the sentence appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

K.K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.
