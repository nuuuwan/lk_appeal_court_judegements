This is an Appeal filed by the Respondent - Petitioner- Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) against the Judgment of the learned

High Court Judge of Jaffna, dismissing a Revision Application by affirming

the determination of the learned Magistrate, under Chapter VII of the

Primary Court Procedure.

Pursuant to an information filed by the Informant - Respondent -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent), in terms of Section

66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the learned Primary Court Judge

held an inquiry into the dispute between Appellant and Respondent, in

respect of the land called "Mathi Valavu" and the premises bearing No. 99

(67), held that the Respondent had been dispossessed by the Appellant and

ordered that possession be restored to the Respondent.

Aggrieved by the said Order, Appellant sought to move in Revision

against the said Order by Revision Application No. 952/05 filed before the

High Court Jaffna. The learned High Court Judge having considered the

submissions made by both parties affirmed the learned Magistrate's Order

and dismissed the Revision Application filed by the Appellant.

The Appellant being aggrieved by the aforesaid Judgment preferred

an Appeal to this Court seeking to set aside the Order made on 22.08.2005

by the learned Magistrate and the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge

dated 19.03.2007.

The Respondent initiated the proceedings in the Primary Court Jaffna

by filing an affidavit dated 14.07.1997. It was averred in his affidavit that he

4

and his wife Phevasothy are the owners of the land and premises, which is

the subject matter of the action by virtue of Deeds No. 13801 and No.

14430. Further stated, on 28th May 1997, the Appellant, wrongfully and

unlawfully trespassed into the said land and is in unlawful and wrongful

occupation. Further stated that he has been forcibly dispossessed from the

said land and premises by the Appellant and prayed that the Appellant be

evicted and that he be given vacant possession of the said land.

The case for the Appellant was that he occupied the land in dispute in

April 1997 with the assistance of the army officers as he did not have a

house to live in. Before he occupied the said house, there were some street

line vendors. They were chased out by the Army officers. The Respondent

and his wife were not in possession of the house since the displacement of

1995.

In this case, the Primary Court Judge was called upon to reach a

decision on the affidavits and documents filed by the parties. After

considering the contents in those affidavits, Magistrate of Jaffna sitting as

Primary Court Judge made Order on 22.08.2005 restoring the Respondent to

possession of the disputed land. The learned High Court Judge of Jaffna

affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate and thereafter the Appellant has

preferred an appeal to this Court.

In an inquiry where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part thereof, it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court to

determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part thereof on the

date of filing of the information under Section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act and make order as to who is entitled to possession of such

5

land or part thereof. But where a forcible dispossession has taken place

within a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed under Section 66, he may make an order directing that

the party dispossessed be restored to possession prohibiting all disturbance

of such possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree

of a competent Court.

Thus, the duty of the Judge is to ascertain which party was or deemed

to have been in possession on the relevant date, namely, on the date of the

filing of the information under Section 66.

Hence, the duty of the Judge is to determine whether, the Respondent

who had been in possession of the land was dispossessed by the Appellant

within a period of two months immediately before the date of filing of the

information. If the Primary Court Judge is satisfied that the Respondent had

been in possession of the land and he had been forcibly dispossessed within

a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed under Section 66, he should make an order directing

the party dispossessed to be restored to possession.

In the instant case the learned Magistrate had made a finding that the

Respondent was in possession of the land and had been dispossessed within

a period of two months immediately before the date of filing of the

information.

On perusal of the entirety of the Order, it is apparent that the learned

Magistrate has taken into consideration the affidavits and documents filed by

both parties and has come to the aforesaid conclusion. Further, I do not see

It

6

any wrong in the manner in which the learned Magistrate has considered the

facts and the way in which he has applied the law in this instance.

Therefore, it is not necessary to interfere with the Judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, who affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, no ground exists which justifies the intervention of this

Court to set aside the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

19.03.2007. and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 22.08.2005.

F or the above reasons, I hold that there is no merit in this Appeal and

dismiss it.
