This is a revision application against an order of the High Court of

Gampaha. The 1 st Accused Petitioner (the Petitioner) with the 2nd accused

was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha on a charge of murder

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial, the Learned

High Court Judge convicted the Petitioner for a lesser offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 297 of the

Penal Code. Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Petitioner

presented this revision application. The Petitioner pleaded that the

Learned High Court Judge did not explain to him that he had a right to be

heard by a jury or by a judge and thereby he was denied a fair trial which

constitute exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of this

Court by way of revision. He further pleaded that he was unaware that he

had a right to appeal within 14 days of the conviction. He states that he

was committed to prison after the pronouncement of the conviction and

therefore he was unable to obtain legal advice and his parents obtained

legal advice and it was too late to file an appeal and the only way to seek

remedy is to move in revision.

The Complainant Respondent (the Respondent) filed objections

and denied the existences of any exceptional circumstances and moved to

dismiss the application.

Before considering the merits of the application, I will consider

whether the Petitioner can maintain this revision application. The

Petitioner had the right of appeal against the order of the Learned High

Court Judge. He failed to exercise that right because he was unaware of

his right of appeal. (Paragraph 13 of the petition dated 30th May 2014) He

pleads his financial difficulty as an additional reason. The ignorance of

law is not an excuse. Therefore his position that he was unaware of his

right to appeal cannot be considered as a valid reason for not exercising

the right given to him by the law. The other reason he pleads is the

financial difficulty. He has undergone a full scale trial in the High Court

and had been defended by a Counsel throughout the trial. He was able to

obtain services of the Legal Aid Service to file this revision application. I

do not see any reason why he could not file an appeal in time, at least,

why he could not file a revision application without delaying for five and

half months.

It is a well established rule that the existence of exceptional

circumstances to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is a

basic requirement. Gamini Amarathunga J. after considering several

authorities, held in the case of Dharmaratne and another v Palm

Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others [2003] 3 Sri L R 24 at page 29 that;

The requirement of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction is not a requirement statutorily laid down

anywhere. As Gunawardana J, himself has referred to, Abrahams

CJ in Ameen v Rashid (supra) has explained the rationale for

insisting on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the

exercise of revisionary jurisdiction. According to Abrahams CJ

revision of an appealable order is an exceptional proceeding and a

person seeking this method of rectification must show why this

extra-ordinary method is sought rather than the ordinary method

of appeal. As Hutchinson CJ has stated in Perera v Silva (supra) it

is not possible to contend that the power ought to be exercised or

that the legislature could have intended that it should be exercised

so as to give the right of appeal practically in every case. Thus the

existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

Court selects the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary

method of rectification should be adopted. If such a selection

process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will

become a gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the

garb of a revision application or to make an appeal in situations

where the legislature has not given right of appeal.

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken

deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed The words used by the legislature do not

indicate that it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice '.

In the instant case, the Petitioner complains that he was denied a

fare trial by not explaining him that he has a right to choose a jury trial or

a non jury trial. He rests his case on the journal entries dated 02.08.2007

(marked as PIE) and 07.03.2011(marked as PIF). The indictment served

on the accused for the first time on 02.08.2007 and the case was fixed for

trial. PIE reads in relation to the service of the indictment that

"indictment served with the documents. Vide proceedings" The Petitioner

failed to submit the proceedings of that date. The Court cannot come to

any conclusion as to what has been transpired on that day. The indictment

was amended subsequently and the amended indictment was served on

07.03.2011. The case proceeded on the amended indictment. As such, the

real service of the indictment is to be considered as the service of the

amended indictment on 07.03.2011. The PIF reads as "Appearance

recorded Indictment amended The charges contained in the indictment

was read over to the Complainants (This seems to be a mistake. It must

be accused.) Pleadings recorded On the applicatiOon of the defence

case is fixed for trial without jury .............. Vide proceedings" The

proceedings of that day is included from page 19 onwards in the

document marked PI, the certified copy of the case record. The Petitioner

has not given a separate marking to the proceeding of that day. In that

proceeding it is clearly recorded that "The amended charge in the

indictment read over to the accused separately and they separately

5

pleaded not guilty to the charge. The case is fixed for trial. On the

application of the accused case is fixed for trial without a jury. "

Though the journal entry says that the case was fixed for a non jury

trial on the application of the defence, it is clearly recorded that the

application was by the accused. Unless the accused is given the

opportunity to choose, there is no way for the accused to make an

application to try the case without a jury. Therefore the allegation of the

Petitioner that he was not explained of his right to choose a jury trial or a

non jury trial cannot stand.

The Petitioner has failed to establish exceptional circumstances to

exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

Accordingly, the application is dismissed without costs.
