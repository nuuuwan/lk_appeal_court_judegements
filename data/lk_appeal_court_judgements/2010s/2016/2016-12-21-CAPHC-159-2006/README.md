This is an appeal filed by the Appellant personally against an order

of the learned High Court Judge of Kegalla. The Appellant being paid the

brief fees after notice, the briefs were prepared and the parties were

noticed again to list the case for argument. The parties were absent and

unrepresented. The Court reissued the notices but the result was the same.

Thereafter the Court fixed the matter for judgment. The notices never

returned undelivered.

The police filed information in the Magistrate Court Warakapola

on a land dispute threatening the breach of the peace. The dispute was

obstructing a threshing floor and the access road. The learned Magistrate

after filing the affidavit, documents and written submissions determined

that the threshing floor and the road has been obstructed and ordered that

the 1 st party Respondent Respondent Appellant is entitle to use them.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 2nd Party Respondent Petitioner

Respondent (the Respondent) moved in revision in the High Court of

Kegalla. The learned High Court Judge after considering the relevant

dates held that the learned Magistrate erred in deciding that the Appellant

is entitle to regain the possession of the threshing floor and the road

because the first information filed in Court after two months of the

purported obstructions and set aside the order of the learned Magistrate.

The Appellant personally presented this appeal against the said

order but did not participate in the hearing.

The Appellant made the first complaint to the police on 17.06.2003

stating that the road leading to the threshing floor has been closed. The

police filed the first information in the Magistrate Court of Warakapola

on 15.09.2003 that is after two months from the date of the first

complaint and definitely after two months from the purported obstruction.

The learned High Court Judge considered this situation and held that the

learned Magistrate shouldn't have entertained this application. The

learned High Court Judge further considered that this was a pong lasting

dispute because the parties have gone before the Agrarian Services

Authorities and sought relief before coming to Court and failing only they

have come to Court. Therefore the learned High Court Judge expressed

her doubt about the threat to the breach of the peace. The learned High

Court judge considered all the circumstances before making the order.

I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned High

Court Judge.

The appeal dismissed without costs.
