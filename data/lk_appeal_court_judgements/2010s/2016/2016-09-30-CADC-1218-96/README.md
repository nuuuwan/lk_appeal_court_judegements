The Plaintiff-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as lithe Plaintiffs") instituted this

action against the original Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as lithe

Defendant"), in the District Court of Galle for a declaration that they be declared

entitled to the land called Digapothagodakanda, in extent 6 acres 2 roods and 5

perches and morefully described in paragraph 2 of the plaint and for ejectment of

the Defendant from the house standing thereon and the soil covered thereby, and

for damages and costs.

The position of the Plaintiffs is that in or about 1970, the Defendant was permitted

to build a small house on the land, with their leave and licence, which they

terminated by their letter dated 26.05.1993 requesting him to vacate the land but in

spite of this termination the Defendant continued to be in possession of the said

land to their detriment and consequently they made a complaint to the Conciliation

Board which could not settle the matter and the dispute finally resulted in this

action being filed in the District Court.

The Defendant filed his answer on 18.10.1995 denying the averments in the plaint

and stating that the land that he occupied was in extent about 30 to 40 perches with

3

specific boundaries and his occupation had been without anyone's permission since

1970, and his uninterrupted and independent possession thereof had inured to him

prescriptive rights to the portion of the said land. The Defendant further averred

that the Plaintiffs had not identified the said land definitely and therefore they had

no cause of action that would ground an action against him -see paragraph 7 of the

Answer.

On 22.04.1996, the trial commenced and the Plaintiff raised issues 1 to 6 and the

Defendant raised issues 7 to 9.

The pt issue raised on behalf of the Plaintiffs reads as follows:

Have the plaintiffs become the owners of the land which is the subject matter of the action by virtue of the title set out in the plaint?

This issue deals with the title to the land which is the subject matter of the action.

The Plaintiffs produced deeds marked P2 to P7 in order to establish their title to the

land. The learned District Judge of Galle has accepted these deeds and held that in

terms of the deeds P3 to P7, it must be admitted that the Plaintiffs are the owners

of the subject matter of this action -see Page 5 of the judgment. Accordingly, the

issue no. 1 as regards title of the Plaintiffs has been answered in the affirmative. It

has to be observed that there is no cross-appeal on the part of the Defendant

against this finding. Thus title of the Plaintiffs to the land has been established.

As against Issue No.1, the Defendant raised Issue No.7, which reads as follows:-

"Did the Defendant in or about 1970/ without the permission of anyone/ come into occupation of this land and build a house on a separate portion of this land with defined boundaries and acquire a prescriptive title th ere to/ by possessing the said portion of the land adversely/ uninterruptedly and independently against the rights of the Plaintiffs and their predecessors in title/ for a period of ten years preceding the date the Plaintiffs states a cause of action accrued? (Emphasis added).

In this issue which flowed from paragraph 6 of the answer the Defendant has clearly

admitted that the land possessed by him is a portion of the land claimed by the

Plaintiffs. I take the view that this is an admission on the part of the Defendant in

his answer and though this issue was rejected by the learned District Judge upon an

4

f

r}

tI,

I I

objection by the Counsel for the Plaintiffs, the Defendant cannot seek to resile from

his pleaded admission.

The objection of the Counsel for the Plaintiffs to the issue was on a different ground.

The counsel objected to the issue on the ground that the Defendant had not

described the portion with boundaries although he had alluded in his answer to a

portion of the subject matter with "defined boundaries".

Since the Defendant had failed to identify the land he alleged he possessed with

clear boundaries, the Court upheld the objection raised by the Plaintiffs' counsel

and rejected issue no. 7.

As is evident, this issue no. 7 is on prescriptive possession and consequent title of

the Defendant. When this issue is rejected by the Court, it is very clear that the

Court has not made its determination on the Defendant's prescriptive title or rights.

If that be so, there is no issue before Court to decide on the Defendant's possession,

whether lawful or unlawful. Even when answering the issues raised by parties, the

learned District Judge has stated in his judgment that issue no. 7 has been rejected

by the Court. Hence, it is clear that the Defendant has not proved his prescriptive

possession or for that mattertitle to his portion.

In the case of Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe Udenis De Silva1 the Privy Council held that:

"In an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal title is in the plaintiff but the property is in the possession of the defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant."

If a person goes into possession of land as an agent of another, prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is holding adversely to his principal."

In view of the above decision, if the Plaintiffs' legal title is admitted by Court, the

burden shifts to the Defendant to prove his possessory right, whether it is lawful or

not and whether it is independent of the Plaintiffs' title or not. This burden of proof

by the Defendant has not been properly and satisfactorily discharged by the

Defendant in the absence of an issue to that effect. The pith and substance of a

finding in favor of the Plaintiffs in regard to their title and that there is no lawful

152 N.l.R 289

5

\

t

possession that has been established by the Defendant cumulatively show that the

Defendant has furnished no evidence of lawful possession before Court.

A similar view was taken in the case of Wadduwage Dharmadasa v. Man three

Vithanage Jinasena2 where Anil Gooneratne J. held that,

"in a rei vindicatio action the Plaintiff must prove and establish his title. If the Plaintiff has so established his title the burden of proof is shifted to the defendant to establish his lawful occupation if any. When the plaintiffs' title is accepted by Court, the burden is on the defendant to establish his prescriptive possession."

The written submission filed on behalf of the Defendant (from page 3 to 10) refers

to the title of the Plaintiffs and state~ that the Plaintiffs have failed to establish their

title and identity of the land. But this is an unsuccessful attempt in vain. When the

Court has decided on the title of the Plaintiffs and held that the Plaintiffs have

established title to the said land, and rejected issue no. 7 of the Defendant, which

issue is vital to prove his prescriptive rights, the only option available to the

Defendant was to have preferred a cross-appeal against these findings. But the

Defendant has not preferred such an appeal or cross-appeal and therefore he

cannot be heard to say in his written submissions that the Plaintiffs have no title to

the land in dispute.

Whilst the Plaintiffs grounded their claim to title to the property on several deeds

which give them a chain of title and such a claim was established on a

preponderance of evidence, the Defendant's position has been a mere assertion of

prescriptive possession of the said land. But this assertion remains unproved and

unestablished.

The Defendant's contention that the Plaintiffs failed to identify the land in dispute

cannot be accepted because the Defendant himself has stated that the land he is

occupying is a portion of the Plaintiffs' land. This has to be construed as an

admission by the Defendant. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs' land is called

Digapothagodakanda, and the land possessed by the Defendant is also known as

Digapothagodakanda. This is very clear on a perusal of the caption of the plaint and

answer. The Defendant's address given in the caption clearly shows that he had

been living on the land called Digapothagodakanda. He cannot deny this fact. If he

now takes up the position that he had been staying on some other land, there must

have been an issue framed on it and evidence led to prove such possession of the

different land. Nowhere has he stated that the land which he occupies is a different

land by a different name.

It must be noted that the Plaintiffs state that they gave leave and licence to the

Defendant to put up a house on the said land in 1970, and the Defendant also states

that he came into possession of the land in 1970. This statement of the Defendant

corroborates that his possession commenced from the time the leave and licence of

the Plaintiffs was granted, which according to the Plaintiffs was in 1970.

No doubt the identity of the disputed land is necessary in view of Section 41 of the

Civil Procedure Code, only when the dispute is over a specific portion of a larger

land. In this case, though the Defendant occupies a portion of the Plaintiffs' land,

the Plaintiffs have filed the action in respect of the whole land called

Digapothagodakanda, in extent 6 acres 2 roods and 5 perches, which has been

identified by Plan Pl. The Plaintiffs' position is that they are owners of the entirety

of the land called Digapothagodakanda, which they have satisfactorily proved and

the Court also answered their issue no. 1 in the affirmative. If the ownership or title

of the Plaintiffs is satisfactorily proved, it is settled law that the burden is on the

Defendant to prove his possession as independent of the Plaintiffs' title. But as

stated before, the unassailable fact remains that the Defendant has failed to prove

his lawful possession.

III I

I

The Defendant admittedly occupies a portion of the Plaintiffs' land called J

Digapothagodakanda. But the argument on behalf of the Defendant proceeded on

the basis that he occupied a different land despite his unequivocal admission that he

was on a portion of Plaintiffs' land. In such a situation the burden of proof of the

Defendant is traceable to the second limb of Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance,

which states:

'When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact it is said that the burden of proof lies on that personN

Thus the burden is on the Defendant to prove that the land he occupies is not a

portion of the Plaintiffs' land but a different land and that his possession is nothing

to do with the Plaintiffs' land. The Defendant has also changed his position and

7

t I

states that he is occupying the road frontage of Hayley road. If that be the position

of the Defendant, he must prove that the land he now occupies is not the land of

the Plaintiffs but a road reservation by a plan, which he has failed to do. The

Defendant cannot blow hot and cold in the same breath.

Victor Perera J. in Kandasamy v. Gnanasekeram3 said:

"A man should not be allowed to blow hot and cold~ to affirm at one time and deny at another"-

See comparable dicta of Sharvananda, c.J in Ranasinghe v. Premadharma4, wherein

His Lordship followed Victor Perera J. in Kandasamy v. Gnanasekeram.s

Hence, it does not appear sound law to permit the Defendant to state different

things about the identity of the land at different times, when he asserted in his

answer that he had been living on a portion of Plaintiffs' land.

Even the contention that "Once issues are framed the case which the Court has to hear and determine becomes crystallized in the issues and the pleadings recede to the background"6 should not be misconceived. Although that is the correct position

for purposes of resolving the fact in issue in a given case, yet the admissions of the

parties in their respective pleadings cannot be lightly ignored. The Defendant's

statement in his answer that "he is occupying 30 or 40 perches of the land which is a

portion of the said land" cannot be totally displaced by a subsequent denial, subject

of course to the rules on amendment of pleadings. Given that there is no

amendment of the answer filed, I hold that it will be difficult for the Defendant to

resile from his admission that the portion in which he has been living is part of the

Plaintiffs' land.

This is congruent with Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance, which states:

"No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing~ or which~ before the hearing~ they agree to admit any writing under their hands~ or which by any rule of

I pleading in force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings:

Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission."

According to this section, the admission of a fact could take place at three stages-to

wit- (i) at the hearing or trial, (ii) before the hearing or trial, or (iii) by rule of

pleading. The admission I have alluded to is found in paragraph 6 of the answer. In

other words it was at the stage of pleadings, which would then be governed by the

rules of pleading obtaining in Sri Lanka namely Civil Procedure Code. Before I turn to

admissions by rule of pleadings, let me also advert to Section 8(1) of the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, which mirrors the spirit of formal admissions

in Section 58.

"in any proceedings it shall not be necessary for any party to tender any evidence of any fact, which is admitted by the opposing party."

Admissions by rule of pleading - Civil Procedure Code

Admissions made in pleadings are also classified as formal admissions within the

meaning of Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance. They constitute formal

admissions because they are utilized by Court to understand the scope of the action

and admissions before Court and issues more often than not flow from pleadings.

The rules of pleading found in the Civil Procedure Code bear repetition. Section

75(d) of the Civil Procedure Code requires that the answer should contain a

statement admitting or denying the several averments of the plaint, and setting out

in detail plainly and concisely the matters of fact and law, and the circumstances of

the case upon which the defendant means to rely for his defence. These would be

express admissions, as for example, where the Defendant admits the execution of a

promissory note, but pleads want of consideration. 7

If the Defendant wishes to dispute any averment in the plaint, he is at liberty to

raise it in his answer. The provisions of Section 75 are imperative and are designed

to compel a Defendant to admit or deny the several allegations in the plaint so that

the question of fact to be decided between the parties may be ascertained by court

7 See Section 75 (d) of the Civil Procedure Code.

on the day fixed for the hearing of the action. It is a rule of pleading in England that

facts alleged in pleadings, if not denied, are deemed to be admitted.

The effect of the failure of a Plaintiff to deny by replication the statements made by

a Defendant in his answer was dealt with in Lokuhamy v. SirimalaB and Fernando v.

The Ceylon Tea Company LtrP. In these cases, the opinion was expressed that the

above rule of the English Law is not applicable under our law. But in Fernando v.

Samarasekere10, our Supreme Court held that where a Defendant does not deny an

averment in the plaint, he must be deemed to have admitted that averment.

Basnayake J. referred to Section 75(d) of the Code as an imperative provision and

distinguished the two earlier decisions on the ground that they dealt with the failure

of a Plaintiff to deny by replication the statement made by a Defendant in his

answer.

In the instant case before this Court, the Defendant's position is that he came to the

land of his own volition and without the permission of anyone in 1970, but he

admitted that he has remained on the said land within a defined boundary -see

paragraph 6 of the answer.

This express admission in the answer becomes admissible in terms of both Sections

21 and 58 of the Evidence Ordinance. The possession of a portion of the plaintiffs'

land is admitted and by virtue of Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance, no evidence

is necessary to prove the fact of possession.

Let me digress at this stage on the question of admissions. We come across

"admissions" for the first time only in Section 17 of the Evidence Ordinance because

the first exception to the hearsay rule in the Evidence Ordinance begins from

Section 17. Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordnance defines an admission as a

statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue

or relevant fact. Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance deals with informal

admissions, whereas Section 58 deals with formal admissions. Whichever category

that an admission belongs to, it has to be remembered that Section 21 of the

Evidence Ordinance renders an admission admissible against the maker of the

admission. Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance makes it quite clear that an out of

court statement such as an admission in an answer but filed before Court is

probative of its truth against the Defendant.

Formal admissions in terms of Section 58 can be relied upon for the truth contained

therein. If the Defendant has made admissions in his answer as in this case, the

admission can be relied upon for its truth and Section 58 makes it clear and no

evidence is necessary to be led in order to prove such admission. If there is a formal

admission, Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance predicates that it cannot be

withdrawn nor could contrary evidence be given to whittle down the effect of the

admission. A slew of Sri Lankan cases confirms this principle.

In the context of an admission made by a Defendant it is pertinent to cite Bertram

c.J. in the case of Mariammai v. Pethrupillaill :

"If a party in a case makes an admission for whatever reason~ he must stand by it; it is impossible for him to argue a point on appeal which he formally gave up in the Court below."

On the question of admission of fact, it is relevant to reiterate the observation of

H.N.J. Perera J, in Jayalath v. Karunathilake12 :

"It is well established principle of law that parties to a case cannot resile from admissions of fact. While it is sometimes permissible to withdraw admissions on questions of law~ admissions of fact cannot be withdrawn."

So it is quite clear that formal admissions of fact which fall within Section 58 of the

Evidence Ordinance cannot be withdrawn. They would operate as estoppel against

the maker of admissions. Sometimes admissions in answers are specifically recorded

as admissions. Merely because some admissions in an answer as in this case are not

recorded specifically so, they do not cease to be admissions. Unrecorded admissions

can equally be utilized against the maker. As I have stated before, the defendant

sought to frame an issue on paragraph 6 of the answer which contains the

admission, but the issue was rejected because the assertion of defined boundaries

that was asserted in the said paragraph was not supported by evidence to identify

the portion of the land he was in possession of -see page 35, 36 and 37 of the brief

for the issue No 7, objections thereon by counsel for the plaintiffs and order of the

learned District Judge. But the admission in the answer would become admissible

against the defendant by virtue of Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinace.

Admissions in pleadings in India

Across the Palk Straits the Indian Sur:-reme Court in the case of Nagindas Ramdas v. Da/patramlchharam alias Brijram and others,13 echoed the following dicta on

admissions in pleadings:

"Admissions, if true and clearl are by far the best proof of the facts admitted. Admissions in pleadings or judicial admissions, admissible under Section 58 of the Evidence Actl made by the parties or their agents at or before the hearing of the casel stand on a higher footing than evidentiary admissions. The former class of admissions are fully binding on the party that makes them and constitute a waiver of proof. They by themselves can be made the foundation of the rights of the parties. On the other handl evidentiary admissions which are receivable at the trial as evidencel are by themselvesl not conclusive. They can be shown to be wrong."

Assertion of another land in appeal

Moreover, in the teeth of the Plaintiffs' assertion that the Defendant got into the

Plaintiffs' land with their leave and licence, the Defendant never raised an issue on

his possession of a different land nor did he attempt to adduce evidence to prove

that the land in dispute was a different land from that claimed by the Plaintiffs. In

the absence of such a plea and evidence, the presumption is in favour of the

Plaintiffs that the land in dispute is a portion of the Plaintiffs' land and that

Defendant got into the land in dispute upon their leave and licence. There was

argument urged before this Court that the Defendant had been living on another

land. Though this assertion is not sustainable in view of the admission I have already

referred to, evidence given by the Defendant puts paid to this argument. The

Defendant admitted in cross-examination that he had been in occupation of the

Plaintiffs' land -please see page 63 of the original record. If the Defendant had

wanted to establish that he was living on a different land, there must have been an

issue raised and evidence led. He could have produced a plan and established that

another land with the same name existed and he was its occupant. This has not

happened and I therefore reject the contention raised in appeal that the Defendant

was on another land.

Section 110 of the Evidence Ordinance enacts:

IIWhen the question is whether any person is owner of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner".

Accordingly, the Defendant has failed to discharge his burden of giving satisfactory

evidence to establish that the Plaintiffs are not the owners of the land in dispute.

I have already referred to the burden of proof devolving on the Plaintiffs. The

learned District Judge has found in their favor as regards title. I made reference to

the second limb of Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance and the Illustration (b) to

this section states as follows:

lilA' desires a court to give judgment that that he is entitled to certain land in the possession of 'B' by reason of facts which he asserts, and which 'B' denies to be true. 'A' must prove the existence of those facts. "

The Plaintiffs have discharged their burden and as against the finding of the learned

District Judge, the Defendant has not adduced any evidence to show that the land in

dispute is a different land and that it is not a portion of the Plaintiffs' land. The

witness Marambahewage Piyasena who was called by the Defendant to give

evidence for him is a close relative of the Defendant but this witness has not given

any useful evidence to support the Defendant's story, other than stating that the

Defendant had got into the land in 1970.

Since the Defendant asserted that his land was a different land, it was his obligation

to establish that fact satisfactorily. It must be mentioned here that the Defendant's

Counsel made a belated application for a commission but the court turned it down.

As I said before, the Defendant should have taken a commission beforehand and

proved that his land is not a portion of the land of the Plaintiffs. If a plan on such a

commission had been taken, it would have established whether the land in

occupation by the Defendant was part of the land belonging to the Plaintiffs or a

different land. In absence of such a plan, it is a clear admission by the Defendant

that the land he occupies is the land called Digapothagodakanda. (as stated in the

caption of the plaint and answer).

13

\iM

f,ff!

If

Thus, having admitted in his answer that the said land is a portion of the Plaintiff's

land, as stated above, the Defendant is estopped from taking a new stand in appeal

that the portion in dispute is a different land.

When the Defendant's application for a commission was rejected by Court, he

should have taken up an interlocutory appeal, at that stage, or agitated that

question in a cross-appeal. The Defendant has failed to take either course of action.

In the absence of satisfactory proof of prescriptive possession by the Defendant, the

Plaintiffs' statement that the Defendant's possession was upon their leave and

licence holds good. It is admitted by the Defendant that just like him there are five

or six other families which have been occupying some other portions of the

Plaintiffs' land. This is permissive possession with the leave and licence of the

Plaintiffs. This gives a presumption that the Defendant also must have got into the

land with the leave and licence of the Plaintiffs.

Inherent error in the judgment

Having found that the Plaintiffs have established their title to the land in question

and concluded that the Defendant has not established his lawful possession, the

finding of the learned District Judge that the Plaintiffs have no cause of action to

institute and maintain this aCtion is erroneous. It is a non sequitur. As a result the

answers given by the learned District Judge of Galle to issues no. 8 and 9 are also

erroneous. In the circumstances, the, learned District Judge's judgment should be set

aside. I proceed to set aside the judgment dated 29th October 1996 and enter

judgment for the Plaintiffs as prayed for.
