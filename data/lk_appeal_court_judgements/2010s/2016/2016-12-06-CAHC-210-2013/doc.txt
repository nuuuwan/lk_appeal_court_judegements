"-It

of

IS alleged by the prosecution that on or about 28

May 2001 the Accused -Appellant did rape one

Guruwela Manamperilage Lilawathi at Tanamalwila within

the jurisdiction of Monaragala.

The prosecutrix, In her testimony to Court has

categorically stated that she was raped by the

Accused- Appellant, though she did not know his name.

But it IS salient to note that she explained to her

daughter about his looks and he was identified In an

identification parade, even after 3 years as he was

arrested only after three years.

Due to the alleged incident the victim was In the

hospital for 10 days, as she was bleeding after the

act of rape and forcible sexual intercourse.

It is being noted that the main ground of appeal IS

the identity of the Accused -Appellant. But the victim

has unequivocally stated that although she did not

know his name has stated that she did identify him

at the identification parade even after three years. The

matter In hand IS not a case of iden tifying the

Accused -Appellant at a

principle laid down In

after the incident the

fleeting glance, which was the

the famous Turnbull case. Even

victim has seen the Accused-

Appellant movIng about In a vehicle. Apparently Accused-

Appellant was also living In the same vicinity. To

fortify the prosecutrix's verSIOn her daughter too has

testified to the effect that on this day In question

while she was returning from Colombo she saw the

Accused- Appellant com1ng from the direction of their

house and proceeding towards his house, and had

observed blood stains 1n his shirt.

The counsel for the Accused- Appellant also contended

that the prosecution has failed to establish that the

Accused was absconding and was arrested only after 3

years. But it was the testimony of the Gramasevake of

the area that although the Accused name appears 1n

the electoral list he was absconding, he was searched

in connection with the alleged incident.

As per MLR the Doctor has gIVen a vivid description

of the 1nJunes received by the prosecutrix and the

apparent cause for the same. It 1S to be noted that

the counsel for the Accused has not cross examined

the above witness regarding his observation as to the

examination of the prosecutrix.

It also salient to note that 1n the course of the trial

at the High Court the counsel for the Accused had

admitted the fact that the accused knew the

prosecutrix for some time and hence iden tifying the

accused 1n the iden tification parade was not challenge.

Therefore it 1S the categorical position of the

prosecu tion that the iden tification of the Accused-

Appellant was not a difficult task for the prosecutrix,

and the said identification does not raIse any doubt

which will be for the benefit of Accused- Appellant.

I " Therefore In the said backdrop it IS abundantly clear

that the Learned High Court Judge has evaluated the

above issue as to the identity of the Accused In the

correct perspective, and the said reason alleged as a

ground appeal cannot stand, as it is devoid of merits.

It is also being noted that the Accused-Appellant has

made a dock statement barely denying his involvement

in the alleged cnme.

For the reasons stemmed form the judgment and the

factual and legal matrix, merits to effect the conviction

and the sentence thereto, be affirmed.

Hence the appeal stands dismissed with the afore said

observations.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed.
