This is an appeal from the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dismissing a revision application filed to revise the order of the

Learned Magistrate of Nugegoda in an application filed by the Police

under section 66 of the Primary Procedure Code Act. The first party

Petitioner, Appellant, (hereinafter called and referred to as the Appellant)

is the son and the second party Respondent, Respondent, (hereinafter

called and referred to as the Respondent) is the mother. The Appellant's

contention is that he was in possession of a room in the house no. 423/8

and was using the kitchen in common. On a certain day when he came

home found that the way to the kitchen had been blocked and he had to

force open the door to gain entrance to the kitchen. The Respondent's

side of the story is that the house belongs to her and she was in

possession of the entire house. She has given certain parts of the house on

rent to several persons and the rest was in her possession. The Appellant

had entered in to the house forcibly and damaged the doors on 27th

February 2014, while she was on a pilgrimage. After an inquiry, the

learned Magistrate delivered the order in favour of the Respondent. The

Appellant filed a revision application in the High Court which was

dismissed in limine. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant

presented this appeal.

The information under section 66 of the Primary Proce~ure Code Act was

filed by the police in the Magistrate's Court on 14.03.2014 informing that

there is a land dispute threatening a breach of peace. This being a dispute

in relation to the possession (a part of a house), the Court has to decide

who was in possession at time of filing the information and whether there

was a dispossession within two months prior to filing it.

The Respondent says that she is the owner of the house in dispute and

produced the title deed marked as 2 wa 1. Even though the ownership is

not the deciding factor in an action under section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, as far as it leads to establish the fact that the owner is in

possession, the ownership is material. The Respondent says that the house

belongs to her and she is in possession of her house. The Appellant is her

son. Under these circumstances, it can be presumed that the house was in

Respondent's possession. The electoral lists for the year 2013 and 2014

further strengthen this fact. The Grama Niladhari has given a certificate

of residence to the Appellant as well as to the Respondent stating" that

they are residing at the disputed premises. Therefore it cannot be

considered as a conclusive proof on possession.

In the book titled "The Law of Property Volume 111, Actions" by

Wiijeyadasa Rajapakshe at page 219 it says,

"As Wille define the possession means physical control by a person

of a corporal thing with the intention of keeping the control of it for

his own benefit. Such possession can be established against the

", whole world The physical element of the possessio!l is that the

person who claims title had control custody or occupation. The

mental element is that he had the intention of possessing it for

himself "

In the present case the control of the house was with the Respondent. The

Appellant has admitted in the police statement dated 2013.09.16 marked

with 1 P A 4 that the Respondent has given this house on rent to several

families. In the statement dated 2013. 11.27, the Appellant has admitted

that the Respondent has given a room to a lady. This establishes the fact

that the control of the premises, that is the physical part of the possession,

was with the Respondent. She has made several complaints to the police

to protect her interest which shows the mental part of possessing it for

herself.

The Appellant has admitted that he is the son of the Respondent. In the

statement dated 2013.09.16 the Appellant admitted that he was residing in

this premises since his childhood. A child who is residing with his mother

does not get any independent right to possession of a part of that house.

The child is licensee and the possession is with the mother. Therefore,

even though the Appellant (the son) resided in the premises, he cannot

claim possession against the Respondent (his mother). Therefore, I hold

that at the time of filing the information, the possession was with the

Respondent.

Under these circumstances I see no reason to interfere with the finding of

the learned High Court Judge. The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs.25000.00
