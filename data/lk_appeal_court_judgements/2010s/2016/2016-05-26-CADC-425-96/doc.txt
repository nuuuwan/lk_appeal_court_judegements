Both Counsel bring to the notice of Court another motion

dated 24.03.2016 which embodies the same terms as has been filed in

the registry yesterday but it does not seem to have got into the docket

as at today. However Counsel tenders to Court a copy of the motion

that was filed yesterday. This copy contains the signature of the

attorney-at-law for the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent signifying the

assent of the Respondent to the terms of settlement that have been

reached between the parties as regards the progress of this case.

Consequent to this settlement, parties agree that this matter could be

dismissed pro-forma as the Appellant wishes to withdraw this appeal.

Accordingly the application for withdrawal IS allowed. The appeal

stands dismissed pro-forma.
