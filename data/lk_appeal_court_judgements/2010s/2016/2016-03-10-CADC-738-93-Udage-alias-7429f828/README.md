VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PCJ(P I CAl

This is a District Court Appeal from the District Court of

Ratnapura Case No. 1197/P. Court observes that no steps have been

taken by the appellants since 2003. When this matter came up before us

on 20/11/2015, since the parties were absent and unrepresented on

that day, the Court decided to issue notices on all the parties. The

Registrar had reported that some of the parties are not in their given

addresses. Today, except the Counsel for the 1St and 3rd defendant-

respondents, no other parties are present or represented before Court.

Since this appeal is pending before this Court from 1993 and in the

1 .. ... 2

absence of any interest by the appellants, Court decides to dismiss this

appeal. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

Registrar is directed to send this case back to the District

Court of Ratnapura along with this order.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P.PADMAN SURASENA, J.

I agree.
