The defendant petitioner has filed this application against the

order of the District Judge of Kuliyapitiya dated 16/06/2005 where the

District Judge has allowed the application for interim injunction sought

by the plaintiff respondent to prevent the defendant petitioner from

proceeding with the auction of the plaintiff respondent's property.

The petitioner has filed the instant application challenging the

granting of the injunction against the petitioner.

The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the plaintiff

respondent have named new parties as respondents without adding

them as defendants in the case with permission of court. The petitioner

stated citing the judgment in Felix Dias Bandaranayake vs Ceylon

Film Corporation 1981 2 SLR 287 that an injunction can be granted

only against a defendant to the main action and not otherwise. In the

instant case while the main action was pending the plaintiff has filed a

separate petition praying for interim relief against second and third

respondents whom have not been added as parties to the main case

with leave of court. The petitioner stated that under sec. 14 of the Civil

Procedure Code addition of parties are permitted in terms of sec. 18 of

the Civil Procedure Code and no person can be added without following

this procedure.

The petitioner stated that accepting and grating relief against the

petitioner and other respondents to the partition is void abinitio and

nothing flows from that petition.

The petitioner further submitted that the District Court has no

jurisdiction to grant injunctions against the resolution passed by the

Bank, under sec. 19 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance as amended by

Act No. 10 of 1974 and Act No. 54 of 2000. The petitioner stated the

3

afore stated Sec. 19 read with Sec. 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance

shows that the District Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such an

application. He cited the judgments in BOC vs Leela De Silva 2003 3

SLR 302, People Bank vs Hewawasam 2000 2 SLR 29, Fernando vs

Peoples Bank CA No. 1100/2004 CA Mts. 03/07/2007.

The counsel for the petitioner also submitted that the District

Court has failed to consider the sequential tests that should be followed

before granting interim injunctions and that as a general rule the case as

a whole should be taken into account and the relative strength of the

plaintiffs case.

The respondent's learned counsel submitted that by way of an

amendment no. 1 of 2011 to the said Act NO.4 of 1990 Sec. SA has

been inserted therefore no action can be taken in terms of recovery of

loans by Bank where the principle amount borrowed as less than five

million rupees. He said the Board resolution was passed before the said

amendment. Therefore the respondent said even though the resolution

was passed the petitioner can not sell the property by public auction

because the said amendment is now in operation. He further stated that

the said amendment No.1 of 2011 and 19 of 2011 clearly prevents the

4

f

petitioner from taking further steps in terms of Sec. 4 or 5 of the said

Act.

The petitioner has filed the instant application praying for leave to

appeal from the order of District Court dated 16/06/2005 and to set

aside the said order and to refuse the said application of the plaintiff

respondent. The argument of the respondent was based on the

amendment brought in after this case was filed and the said interim

injunction was granted. Therefore his argument fails at the beginning

it-self this amendment has come into operation long after the said case

was filed and the order dated 16/06/2005 was made.

The submissions of the respondent are that the petitioner is not

permitted to sell the property as per resolution passed by the petitioner

in view of the amended Act in 2011. The issue before this court is

whether the interim injunction granted by order dated 16/06/2005 is valid

in law. The respondent has made submissions on a future event that

might or might not take place.

The petitioner submitted that a Board Resolution can not be

challenged in the District Court. Sec. 19 of the Bank of Ceylon

Ordinance as amended by Act No. 10 of 1974 and Act No. 54 of 2000

states thus;

~

"Subject to the provisions 0/ section 20 the board may by

resolution to be recorded in writing authorize any person

specified in the resolution to sell by public auction any movable

or immovable 0/ property mortgaged to the bank as security lor

any loan, overdraft, advance or other accommodation in respect

0/ which de/ault has been made in order to recover the whole 0/

the unpaid portion 0/ such loan, overdraft, advance or other

accommodation, and the interest due thereon up to the date 0/

the sale, together with the moneys and costs recoverable under

section 26 and thereafter it shall not be competent lor the

borrower or any person claiming through or under any

disposition whatsoever 0/ the right, title or interest 0/ the

borrower to and in the property made or registered subsequent

to the date 0/ the mortgage to the bank, in any court to move to

invalidate the said resolution or the subsequent sale lor any

cause whatsoever, and no court shall entertain any such

application",

Cases should be decided and orders should be reviewed

according to the laws at the time of filing of actions the laws are

applicable prospectively unless the law itself has specifically states such

laws shall apply retrospectively as stated by the petitioner in De Silva

6

vs Weerasinghe 78n9 NLR 334, Talagune vs De Livera 1997 1 SLR

253, and also BOC vs Leela De Silva 2003 3 SLR 304 it was decided

that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation

unless such a construction appears in the Act.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to set aside the order dated

16/06/2005 marked LA 10 and grant relief as prayed for in the prayer to

the petition. The application of the petitioner is allowed.
