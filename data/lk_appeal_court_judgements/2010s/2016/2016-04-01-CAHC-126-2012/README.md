Accused Appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

In this case the main contention of the counsel for the Accused

Appellant was with regard to the fact that the original indictment in this

case has been amended on 24.04.2008 and that the said amended or

new indictment which had been filed, has not been read over and

explained to the Accused. On perusal of the said proceedings of

24.04.2008 it is clearly seen that the State Counsel had moved to file an

amended indictment and accordingly a new indictment had been filed in

Court.

It is also clearly seen that although the said indictment had been

filed, the said charges under the new indictment had not been read over

and explained to the Accused. Instead the Counsel who appeared for the

Accused Appellant had moved time to consider the said amended

indictment and to cross examine the witness thereafter. Thereafter the

Court had proceeded to trial on the said amended indictment without

acting under Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore, on

perusal of all the journal entries and the relevant proceedings, it is clear

that the High Court Judge had failed to comply with the said Section 167

of the Criminal Procedure Code and read over the charges to the Accused

Appellant in this case.

Learned Counsel for the Respondent concedes this fact and moves

that the conviction and the sentence of the Accused Appellant be set

aside and the matter be referred back to the High Court for re-trial.

After considering the submissions made by the parties, this Court

is satisfied that the learned Trial Judge had failed to comply with Section

167 of the Criminal Procedure Code and therefore the said conviction

and sentence of the accused be set aside. Therefore we set aside the

conviction and the sentence of the learned High Court Judge of Negombo

dated 20.03.2012 and direct the present High Court Judge in Negombo
