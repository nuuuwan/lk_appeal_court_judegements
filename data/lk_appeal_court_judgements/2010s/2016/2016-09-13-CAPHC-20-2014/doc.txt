L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from High Court of Galle. The 2nd Respondent

Petitioner Appellant (Hereinafter sometime called and referred to as the

Appellant) was personally present before this Court and was directed to

collect the brief and case was set down for argument. Thereafter the

Appellant did not come before the Court. He was issued with the notice of

argument and his registered Attorney At Law was also informed but neither

of them were present or took part in the argument. Accordingly the Court

directed the Counsel for the 1 st Respondent Respondent Respondent to

proceed.

The facts are briefly as follows. On a complaint made by the 1 st

Respondent Respondent Respondent (Hereinafter sometime called and

referred to as the 1st Respondent), the police filed a report under section 66

of the Primary Court Procedure Act in the Primary Court Baddegama. After

having filed all necessary documents, the learned Primary Court Judge

pronounced order determining that the 1 st Respondent is in possession of the

land in dispute. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant moved in

revision in the High Court of Galle. The learned High Court Judge

dismissed the application. This appeal is from that dismissal.

The 1 st Respondent's complaint is that the land marked lot 1 in extent

of23.51 perches depicted in the plan no. 278 prepared by W.S.Wijethilaake

Licensed Surveyor for the partition case no. 14340 in the District Court of

Galle, was in his possession for more than 25 years. The Appellant who was

living in the adjoining land was disturbing his possession. The Appellants

case is that he is in possession of the land called Thalgahawatta alias

Walagedaea Watta in extent of about 40 perches. He never claimed the land

described by the 1 st Respondent.

3

The disputed land is lot no. 1 in plan no 278. The 15t Respondent

made the complaint to the police for disturbing his possession in the said lot

no 1. The surveyor report attached to the plan no.278 prepared for the

partition case states that only the 15t Respondent claimed that block of land.

The Appellant does not claim lot 1. Considering all the factors, the learned

Primary Court Judge has come to the correct finding that the 15t Respondent

is in possession oflot no. 1 of plan 278.

The Appellant moved in revision against the order of the learned

Primary Court Judge in the High Court of Galle. The learned High Court

Judge dismissed the revision application without issuing notice.

The learned High Court Judge has failed to give any reason for his

decision. He may have considered the relevant facts and the law, but it is the

duty of the Judge to record the reasons for his finding.

The Appellant in paragraph 12 of his petition to the High Court aver

certain reasons for his application and in paragraph 13 he states that those

reasons are special (95G'a;f~) and extraordinary (q~JJZii (,:)) reasons and are

adequate reasons to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

The first reason stated is that the learned Primary Court Judge has not

identified the land. The learned Primary Court Judge has considered the

police report and the relevant affidavits and identified the disputed land as

the land described by the 1 5t Respondent. The identification of the land is a

matter of evidence. The second reason is that the learned Primary Court

Judge has not mentioned the section under which the order was made. The

sections 68 and 69 of the Primary Court Procedure Act provide the

necessary law for the judge to make the determination. It is not mandatory

for the judge to mention the section in the order.

" 4

The third ground of complain is that the learned Primary Court Judge

has acted on a plan made in 2001. The plan and the report are evidence of

the case and the judge has decided to accept that evidence. It may be a

ground for an appeal but certainly not as reason for a revision application.

Revision is not to correct the errors but to maintain proper administration of

justice.

The fourth ground stated by the Appellant is that the learned Primary

Court Judge has relied on the police officer's observation which was taken

without the Appellant's participation. He cannot complain on this because

the police officer has requested the Appellant to be present in the disputed

land and waited for about half an hour but he has not turned in. The police

officer has entered a note on this and proceeded to hold the inquiry.

Therefore this is also not an exceptional ground which warrants the exercise

of the revisionary jurisdiction.

The next ground of the Appellant is that the learned Primary Court

Judge has not decided who was in possession on the date of filing the first

information. The judge has made a determination as to who was in

possession and made order accordingly. The next ground is purely on

evidence and the final two reasons given by the Appellant are uncertain and

vague.

All the reasons or grounds given by the Appellant separately or

collectively do not constitute exceptional circumstances and the learned

High Court Judge's decision to dismiss the revision 'application is correct.

Even though the learned High Court Judge has not given any reason for his

order, and an order without reasons is not an order recognized by law, under

the circumstances of this case we do not intend to interfere with the said

order.

Accordingly we affirm the order of the learned Primary Court Judge

dated 08.01.2014 and dismiss the revision application.
