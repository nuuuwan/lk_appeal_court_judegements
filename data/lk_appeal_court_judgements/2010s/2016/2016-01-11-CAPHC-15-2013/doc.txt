Respondents to compel them to restore the Petitioner to the post of

principal of Swarnamali Girls Collage. The Learned High Court

Judge by his order dated 28.03.20l3, has granted the reliefs sought

by the Petitioner - Respondent by the above petition.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondents- Appellants had

appealed to this Court to have the said impugned order set aside

or vacate.

The facts as tersely stated in the above petition are as follows;

That the Petitioner obtained a degree of Bachelor of Science

followed by a Post Graduate Diploma with honours, and holds a

degree of Master of Science in Science Education.

The Petitioner has also served as an Assistant Lecture at the

University of Peradeniya.

It IS averred by the Petitioner that she entered In to the

Education Administrative Service in 2007 and assumed duties as a

Deputy Principal of Viharamahadevi Girls Collage in 2007, and was

transferred to Swarnamali Girls Collage to the same post in 2009.

It is stated further that after qualifying the examination of

Education Administrative Service, she was elevated to the post of

Assistant Director and to the post of Principal including the

Swarnamali Girls Collage.

It IS also contended by the Petitioner that above school IS

categorised as lAB school and even a person who is in grade 01

of Principal Service cannot hold that post.

In effect the Petitioner was appointed as the Acting Principal of

the said School, from 23.11.2011.

It is further stated by the Petitioner, that the constitution of the

Sri Lanka administration of education servIce has been established

by the gazette notification issued on 01.03.2002, and the

qualification and requirements for the higher grades are shown in

the said gazette. According to the said gazette it IS a condition

precedent to have a service of at least three years as a principal

In a school.

It IS alleged by the Petitioner, that when she was appointed as a

acting principal, she had a reasonable expectation to be the

Principal of the said school.

The core Issue relevant to be resolved emanates from the

paragraph 14 of the above petition. It IS stated by the Petitioner

that the 12th Respondent is In the category of principles and she IS

not entitled to the post of the principal 1 AB school such as

Swamamali Girls Collage.

In addition to the afore said it IS stated by the Petitioner that by

the letter dated 17.02.2012 that she was transferred to the zonal

education office and the 12th Respondent has been appointed as the

principal of the said Swamamali Girls Collage by letter dated

29.022012, on the basis that she has obtain the highest marks at

the interview.

The Petitioner further asserts that the 1 st to 11 th Respondents have

no power to transfer her, and it is only the Secretary or additional

Secretary authorized by the Public Service Commission.

In the above setting the Petitioner

In contesting the above suit by the 1 st to 12th Respondents, by

way of objections had stated the following;

That as per document marked P9A, paragraph 29 of the said

document, the post of Principal, Deputy Principal, and Assistant

Principal of schools will normally be held by the officers of the

Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service. But it is said that

the Cabinet Ministers have reserved the right to appoint any

public officer to any of the posts of Principal, Deputy Principal, or

Assistant Principal of Schools.

That the Petitioner was appointed as acting Principal of Swamamali

Girls College with effect from 23.03.2011, by the letter marked as

R3. It is the categorical position of the Respondents that the said

appointment was an acting appointment till a permanent appointment

is made, and as such no legitimate expectation was gIven to the

Petitioner that she could be appointed as the Principal of

Swamamali Girls College. The said appointment was done with the

decision taken by the Cabinet Ministers of the Central Province

Provincial Council.

It is averred by the Respondents that the paper advertisement dated

16.05.2011, the 2nd Respondent called for applications for the post

of Principal, which was fallen vacant since 1.1.2011. Pursuant to the

above advertisement, five applicants including the Petitioner has

applied for the said post in Swamamali Girls College. Thereupon

after analysing the qualifications of the applicants by the interview

board, the 12th Respondent was selected to the said post, as she

has secured the highest marks at the interview as evident by the

document marked R8.

9

\

I 1 j

t r t i ! It is also contended by the Respondents that according to Section I

I, 32(1) of the Provincial Council Act No. 42 of 1987, appointment,

transfer, dismissal, and disciplinary control of the provincial public l

servIce is vested with the Governor of the Province. Nevertheless

III terms of Section 32(2) of the said Act as amended by section

4 of the Act No. 28 of 1990, the Governor from time to time

may delegate to the Chief Secretary or any officer of the provincial

public service of that province, its power of appointment, transfer,

dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the provincial

public service. It is further said that by the letter dated 20.11.1990

marked as P9, the Governor of Central Province Provincial Council

has delegated his powers to the officers stated in the above letter.

In the said back drop the Respondents assert that the transfer

made as per letter marked P 14 is legal and state that it is not

mandatory to serve as a Principal for three years for the next

promotion.

In considering the impugned order of the Learned High Court

Judge, it IS apparent that more weight has been given to the

academic and professional qualifications of the Petitioner more than

the marks obtained at the interview by the 12th Respondent who was

appointed to the post of principal in the Swarnamali Girls College.

The selection was done according to the Respondents on the marks

that was obtained by the candidates. In that it is obvious that the

12TH Respondent has obtained the highest marks iii th.:: said

interview. Therefore it IS intensely relevant to note that criterion

for the appointment to the post of principal was not only the

academic and professional qualifications but the marks obtained in

the interview. The Learned High Court Judge has totally based

his order on the academic and professional qualifications of the

10

Il

Petitioner and the 12th Respondent. If that should be the criterion

then the necessity to hold an interview is futile. In addition the

Learned High Court Judge has also commented on

obtained for the proficiency In English Language by the Petitioner

and the 12th Respondent. It IS seen that the Petitioner has obtained

only 4 marks where as the 12th Respondent has obtained 6 marks,

and it was the opinion of the Learned High Court Judge, as the

Petitioner has obtained the Masters Degree in the English medium,

and to get lesser marks than the 12th Respondent is erroneous in

the marking scheme.

Further it is stated In the said impugned order that the Petitioner

had been working as Deputy Principal and Acting Principal of the

said Swarnamali Girls College and it IS stated that In the

interview the Board has been bias In gIVIng marks to the

Petitioner.

Therefore in the above setting the Learned High Court Judge was

of the view that grave prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner,

as such the High Court Judge was of the view that, this IS a fit

and proper case to exercise his discretion to Issue a Writ of

Certiorari and was issued accordingly.

Further it was ordered that the Respondents should accept the

appeal of the Petitioner, and to place the Petitioner in the above

school as the Principal or to appoint her to another school of the

same grade to the same post.

The Respondents - Appellants by their written submissions had

further submitted the following;

That the Petitioner- Respondent served as the Deputy Principal of

Viharamahadevi Girl's Collage and thereafter was transferred to

11

I

~

Swamamali Girl's Collage and thereafter was appointed to cover up

the duties in the post of Principal in the said school with effect

from 23rd February 2011.

By the above dated letter marked as R3 it IS specifically stated

that the Principal at the relevant period has retired, and till a

Principal IS appointed through an interview had appointed the

Petitioner -Respondent to cover up the duties in the said post of

Principal. Therefore it IS the categorical position of the Respondents-

Appellants that by the afore said letter no legitimate expectation

was gIven to the Petitioner- Respondent. It is crystal clear that the

Petitioner-Respondent will be compelled to face an interview if she

intends to remain as the Principal of the said school. As I have

stated above the academic and professional qualification will not be

the sole criterion to the appointment to the said post, but any

candidate applying for the above post should face the interview

and should be able to secure the highest marks in the mterview.

Therefore it is abundantly clear that as per document marked R8,

that the 12th Respondent has obtained the highest marks, where as

the Petitioner- Respondent has obtained lesser marks than the 12th

Respondent. Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the Petitioner-

Respondent's claim is devoid of merits.

The Appellants further assert, that by the documents marked P5

and P6, which clearly indicate who can apply for the post of

Principal and the instruction sheet, by which the applications were

called from those who belong to Sri Lanka Education Administrative

Service and Sri Lanka Principal Service. Therefore it is contended by

the Respondents- Appellants that the 12th Respondent was from the

Sri Lanka Principal Service and was eligible to apply for the post of

Principal.

f Ii t I

J [ II

The Respondents had further alleged that the Petitioner has suppress

the existence of the above documents which are not favourable to

her and there by guilty of suppressmg material facts before Court.

It is also alleged by the Respondents-Appellants that the Petitioner

has distorted certain facts which relate to the appointment to the

post of Principal. It is contended by the Appellants that anyone

representing the SLPS could apply for the post of Principal.

Further it IS impugned by the Respondents -Appellants that the

Learned High Court Judge has erred in law by re- scrutinizing the

marks and not considering the marking scheme, as per exhibit

marked R7.

Hence m the above setting it is alleged by the Respondents-

Appellants that the Petitioner- Respondent has failed to established

that her legal rights have been violated by the Respondents by not

appointing her as the Principal of the Swarnamali Girls College, for

her to seek the relief by way of a mandate in the nature of a

Mandamus.

It is also the unequivocal position of the Respondents- Appellants

that the said post of Principal can be held by any officer of

SLPS, and morefully it IS stated that when the Petitioner-

Respondent assumed duties as the Vice Principal of the said

School, the Principal of the said School was held by an officer

of the SLPS.

Therefore in the above exposition of the facts and the law this

Court IS of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has

arrived at a erroneous conclusion by allowing the Petitioner's

application.
