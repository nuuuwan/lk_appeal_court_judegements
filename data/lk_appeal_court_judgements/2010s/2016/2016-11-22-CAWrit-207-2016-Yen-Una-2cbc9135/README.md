Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J (P / CAl,

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Senior State

Counsel representing the Respondents in this case. The Petitioner to

the present case Rev. Unapana Chandawimala Thero, has come

before this Court seeking a writ of certiorari and mandamus to

quash the decision of the 3rd Respondent which was produced

marked P4 and also directing the 3 rd Respondent to conduct an

inquiry under Section 15 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance

on the 3rd Respondent. As observed by this, court by document P4

the 3rd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that he had

received a letter from the Mahanayake of Malwatta Chapter dated

03.06.2016 removing the Petitioner from the Viharadhipathi post and

- 2 -

appointing another priest as the Viharadhipathi of the said Temple

and due to that appointment the 3rd Respondent have informed

that he had to cancel the registration of the Petitioner in view of the

letter he had received from the Mahanayake Thero. As observed by

this court the 3rd Respondent had not taken any steps to remove the

Petitioner from the post of Viharadhipathi since it had been done

only by the Mahanayake Thero of Malwatta Chapter. It is brought to

the notice of Court by the learned Senior State Counsel that by letter

dated 03.06.2016 the Mahanayake Thero of the Malwatta Chapter

had written the 3rd Respondent, of the decision taken by the

Malwatta Chapter, after considering a report submitted by the

committee appointed by the said chapter with regard to the conduct

of the Petitioner and thereafter decided to remove him from the post

of Viharadhipathi. From this material it is clear that the decision to

remove the Viharadhipathi was clearly taken by the Mahanayake

Thero of the said chapter and therefore the 3rd Respondent is not

responsible for the removal of the Viharadhipathi from his position.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner had brought to our notice of

Section 15 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance but we observe

that the provisions of the said Section has no application to this

case since there was no complaint before the 3rd Respondent for him

to conduct an inquiry and take a decision with regard to the

Petitioner since the entire matter had been looked into by the

Mahanayaka Thero of the Malwatta Chapter.

For the reasons discussed above it is our considered view that

a writ application will not lie against the Respondents who are before

this court for the reason that they were not involved in removing the

Viharadhipathi from Divrumpola Purana Rajamaha Viharaya In

this application. Application is accordingly dismissed.

S.Thurairaja, PC, J. I agree.
