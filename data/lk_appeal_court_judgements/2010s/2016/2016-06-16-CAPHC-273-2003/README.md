P.R. Walgama, J

The Petitioner - Appellant has appealed to this Court,

against the order of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 29.09.2003, to have the said order set aside.

The facts emerged from the appeal, albeit brief are as

follows;

The 3rd Defendan t Society held an inquiry in terms of

Section 44 of the Co operative Society Law No. 3 of

1972 and has sent summons indicating that there IS a

shortage of a sum of Rs. 78941.71 and a sum of Rs .

. . ' 12588/ as the interest is due to the 3rd Respondent

Society.

The Petitioner - Appellant had moved for a mandate In

the nature of writ of Certiorari to have the said order

quashed and for rejecting the appeal made' to the

Commissioner by the document marked P3. The said

appeal was rejected on the ground that the deposit

required for the acceptance of the appeal In terms of

Rule 49 (XII) (b) has not been deposited

Nevertheless it IS stated that the Petitioner - Appellant

has appealed to the Minister concerned within 14 days,

the Respondent has filed the Arbitrators certificate In

However after the Appellant received the notice from

the Magistrate Courts he filed an application In the

Provincial High Court holden at Hambantota to have

the arbitral award quashed by a writ of Certiorari and

for a writ of Mandamus compelling the 1 st Respondent

which has to hold an . . InquIry In to alleged shortage

of Section 44 of the Co operative Societies law No. 5

application

The said application has been rejected on the basis

that the Petitioner - Appellant has not complied with the

Rule 49 (xii)(a) and had rejected his application "i"h tert11.s

of the above Rule. It IS contended by the appellant

that as per rational In Sebastian Fernando .VS Katana

It is pertinent to note the out come of Sections 58(2),

conferred on the Registrar and his deCisions ~wl1lch has

a bearing on the dispute resolution.

Section 58 (4) it IS explicitly stated that no party shall

be entitled ,either

to appear before

such appeal.

by himself or by any representative

and be heard by the Registrar on

Further it IS to be noted that In terms of Section

58(5) gives wide powers to the Registrar by stating that

a decision of the Registrar under subsection(2) or In

appeal under Subsection (3) shall be final and shall not

be called in question in civil court.

On a perusal of the impugned order

High Court Judge it IS apparent that

of the Learned

the said order

is based on two main issues. It has been observed by

the Learned High Court Judge that the Petitioner-

Appellant has sought relief from the High Court against

the 1 st Respondent after expiration of 11 mopt:hs from

the alleged order marked as P4 being the decision of

the Arbitrator who has refused to accept the appeal In

terms of the Rule 49 (XII) (b).

The next point the Learned High Court was compelled

'"-" .. '!. ,.~'-~:' , to reject the Petitioner's application was that, the

documents that were tendered along with the application

were not originals nor certified copIes of the same.

Therefore it IS contended by the Respondent that the

afore said laps on the part of the Petitioner::' Appellant

IS a violation of Court of Appeal Rules 3(1) (a) which

states thus;

form of exhibits. Where the Petitioner IS unable to

tender any such document, he shall state the reason

for such In ability and seek the of Court

furnish such documents later. Where a Petitioner fails

to comply with such provIsIOns of the Rule the Court

may, ex mero motu or at the instance of any party,

dismiss such application.

Therefore In the above exposition of the Legal and

factual matrix this Court is of the view that the appeal

should fail.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed.
