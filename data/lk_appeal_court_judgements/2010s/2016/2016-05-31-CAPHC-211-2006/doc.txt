This is an application to revise an order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Badulla. The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The 1 st

Respondent Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometime called and

referred to as the Appellant) made a complaint to Buttala police stating

that he received a telephone call that one Ranweera is clearing his land.

He made this complaint to the police without going to the land.

Thereafter he went to the land with the police and observed that the said

Ranaweera, with the Appellant's father in law, clearing his land. The

police investigated into the complaint and submitted a report to the

Magistrate Court of Monaragala under section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act. The Appellant was the 1 st party Respondent, his father in

law Kulathunga and Ranaweera were the 2nd party Respondents. R.M.

Cyril intervened after affixing notice. The parties tendered their

respective affidavits and counter affidavits with the relevant documents.

The Appellant stated that the land descried in the schedule A to his

affidavit was in his possession and a portion of the said land described as

schedule B in the affidavit was cleared and fenced out by his farther in

law, the 1st Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometime

called and referred to as the 1 st Respondent) and the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometime called and referred to as

the 2nd Respondent). The 1st Respondent stated that he was later given an

annual permit for the crown land that he was cultivating for a long time.

Thereafter, he was given a grant to the land. He said that he divided the

land in to three lots and one lot was given to his brother Cyril who has

constructed a house and residing in the said block of land and another lot

was given to his elder daughter who was married to the Appellant, is also

residing in the that block. The third lot was reserved for his younger

daughter. He further says that he used to visit his elder daughter regularly

and during those visits he looked after the block of land in question and

further he advised Cyril who was residing in the adjoining land to look

after the land. His contention was that the land in dispute was in his

possession though he is not residing.

The learned Magistrate held that the land in dispute was in the 2nd

Respondent's possession. The Appellant being aggrieved by the said

order moved in revision in the High Court of Badulla, where the order of

Magistrate Court was affirmed. This appeal is against the said order of

the Learned High Court Judge.

The Appellant argues that the learned Magistrate has not identified

the land in question.

4

The Appellant is married to the daughter ofthe 1 st Respondent. The

land where the Appellant is residing is given to them by the 1 st

Respondent. The 1 st Respondent's version is that he gave a portion of

land to the Appellant and reserved another block of land to be given to

the younger daughter and the Appellant's case is that he was possessing

the entire land until a portion was fenced out by the Respondents.

The police officer who investigated in to the dispute has drawn a

sketch showing the disputed land. In that sketch he has shown the blocks

of lands where Cyril and the Appellant were in possession and the land in

dispute. The sketch drawn by the police shows the boundaries of the

disputed land as north by the road, east by land belongs to the Appellant,

south by the land belongs to Gunaratne and west by the land belongs to

Rupasinghe. The learned ~1agistrate in his order described the disputed

land in a different way. The northern boundary according to the order of

the learned Magistrate is the commercial land. The police sketch shows a

strip of land in the extreme north as a land for commercial purposes, but

as per the sketch, the land was divided in to three blocks including the

said commercial land. The police reported to court under section 66 that

there is a dispute arisen over a land threatening a breach of peace and

filed the sketch of the land with the report describing what the disputed

land is. The Court is expected to make an order to prevent the breach of

peace in relation to the land dispute identified by the police as threatening

to peace. The learned Magistrate identified the disputed land as a part of

the land granted to the Respondent excluding the commercial land.

It is very significant that the land claimed as the disputed land by

the 1 st Respondent is only a portion of the commercial land on the north

excluding the land granted. As per the schedule of the affidavit of the 1 st

Respondent, the southern boundary of the disputed land is the land of the

5

1 st Respondent described in the grant no. mo/pra 55261. Southern

boundary of the land granted is the land of Gunarathne Banda. The land

claimed by the 1 st Respondent is the land from the road to the northern

boundary of the land granted to the 1 st Respondent. That is the strip of the

commercial land. According to the order of the learned Magistrate the

disputed land is the land from the commercial land to the north up to the

land of Gunarathne Banda to the south, which is the land granted to the 1 st

Respondent. The police reported that the land dispute is in relation to

both blocks, the commercial land and the land granted. The 1st

Respondent claimed the commercial land as the disputed portion and the

learned Magistrate determined that the land granted to the 1 st Respondent

by grant 55262 is in the 1st Respondent's possession. Nothing was

mentioned about the cornmercialland.

The letter issued by th~ Divisional Secretary of Buttala marked 2

Waga. 13 explain how the commercial land came in to existences. It was

a land auctioned in the year 1955. The 1 st Respondent's land consists of

two blocks of land, one is the commercial land and the other is the land

granted to him by the grant 55262 marked 2 Waga. 4. The letter 2 Waga

13 describes the Appellant's land's northern boundary as the road and the

southern boundary as the boundary described in the grant, which means

the two blocks - the commercial land and the land described in the grant -

as one land.

In this case there is another significant factor that has to be

considered. Though the 1 st Respondent argues that the learned Magistrate

has failed to identify the land properly, there is no disagreement to the

identity of the land in dispute. The Appellant describes the land entire

land which was in his possession in schedule A of his affidavit. It is the

block of land including a part of the commercial land and a part of the

6

land granted to the 1 st Respondent. The disputed portion described in

schedule B, which is only a part of commercial land. The boundaries are

described in the same manner as I have pointed out earlier. The 1st

Respondent is also describing the disputed land as a portion of the

commercial land. The police reported that the disputed land is the land

consisting of the commercial land and the land granted.

This litigation was started in the year 2004 and it has already taken

12 years. Section 67(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act provides that

an inquiry under that chapter shall bring to an end within three months. A

determination under chapter vii of the Act is a temporary measure to

prevent the breach of peace until the rights of parties are finally decided

in a competent civil Court. As such it is not fair by the parties to send this

case for re inquiry.

The learned Magistrate has considered the evidence and came to a

finding that the 1 st Respondent was in possession of the portion of land

granted. He has considered the affidavits and the documentary evidence.

The learned Magistrate has not accepted certain affidavits tendered by the

Appellant in evidence. He has reasoned out why he is not accepting that

evidence. It is for the trial judge to decide whether to accept the evidence

or not on legally acceptable reasons. In the instant case, the trial judge has

given reasons. It has been held in the case of Gunwardene v. Cabral that;

GUNEWARDENE v. CABRAL AND OTHERS [J980]2Sri L R 220

(6) The appellate court will set aside inferences drawn by the trial

judge only if they amount to findings of fact bas~d on: -

(a) inadmissible evidence; or

(b) after rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; or

(c) if the inferences are unsupported by evidence; or

7

(d) if the inferences or conclusions are not rationally

possible or perverse.

In the instant case the finding of the learned Magistrate that the

portion of land blocked out from the land granted to the 15t Respondent

was in the possession Respondent need not be interfered.

The portion identified as the disputed portion by the parties is the

portion blocked out from the commercial land. The Appellant admit that

the possession of the land was with the 15t Respondent at the time of

filing the information in Court. He admits that the 15t Respondent cleared

the land and fenced out it; means that the 15t Respondent was in

possession. It is for the Appellant to prove that he was in possession and

was dispossessed within two months prior to the institution of this action.

When the Appellant received the information that Ranaweera was

clearing the land, he did not take any interest at least to go to the land and

question as to what that person is doing in his land. He directly went to

the police station and made a complaint. He was careful enough not to

disclose the person who gave him the information. The natural behavior

of a person is to go to his land and see what is happening there. The

truthfulness of the whole st0ry of the Appellant becomes doubtful.

The Appellant tendered several affidavits to establish his

possesslOn. The learned Magistrate has examined these affidavits and

expressed the view that they are not reliable. I do not intend to reconsider

that finding. I wish to mention at this stage that two persons who sworn

affidavits marked 1 wa 9 and 1 wa lOin favour of the Appellant, have

withdrawn their affidavits by the letter marked 2 Waga 8.

The Appellant's residence is not in question. He has tendered

evidence to establish that he is residing within the premises. The question

8

is whether the block of land in dispute was in his possession prior to

instituting this action. The Appellant has failed to prove that fact.

I hold that the block of land divided from the commercial land was

also in 15t Respondent's possession at the time of institution of this action

and the Appellant has failed to establish that he was in possession prior to

institution of the action and was dispossessed.

Accordingly, I hold that the land in dispute reported by the police,

bounded north by the road, east by land belongs to the Appellant, south

by the land belongs to Gunaratne and west by the land belongs to

Rupasinghe was in the possession of the 15t Respondent and he is entitle

to posses.

The Appeal is dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-

At this stage I wish to point out another development in this issue.

The Divisional Secretary of Monaraga has seized the property by his

letter dated 10.03.2005. This judgment in any manner shall not be

interpreted as nullifying the said seizer.
