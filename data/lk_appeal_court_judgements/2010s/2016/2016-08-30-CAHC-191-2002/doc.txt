12.08.2016

We have heard both counsel in support of their respective

cases and we find that the learned High Court Judge has

commi tted a grave irregularity and also has erred in law,

where he decided to convict the accused for the offence of

grave sexual abuse under section 365 (2) (b), when the Accused

was charged for rape.

The facts of this case as submitted by the learned counsel for

the Accused Appellant was that on 29.10.1998 around 2.00-3.00

p.m in the afternoon, the victim had gone to the Mosque. On

her way to Mosque, she had gone to pluck jam fruit in the land

1

of the Accused Appellant. This fact has been admitted by the

Accused Appellant in his dock statement. Alleged incident has

taken place at that time, when she went to pluck jam fruit in

the land of the Accused Appellant. She has returned home and

informed the incident to her mother when she was questioned by

her. Thereafter they have complained to the Police on the

following day and thereafter investigation has carried out.

However, learned counsel for the Accused Appellant submitted

that there is a question of law related to this case. He

submits that the Accused Appellant had been charged for rape

under Section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code as per the

indictment. However after prosecution and the defense, cases

were closed. Learned trial judge having considered the

medical evidence, has decided to amend the charge to grave

sexual abuse under Section 365 (b) of the Penal Code as

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995. Learned Counsel for the

Accused Appellant submits that this is a misdirection of law

made by the learned High Court Judge.

Learned DSG appearing for the State upholding the best

tradi tions of the Attorney General's Department concedes the

2

argument made by the learned counsel for the Accused

Appellant. He submits that both charges of rape and charge of

grave sexual abuse are cognate offenses introduced to the

Penal Code of Sri Lanka and therefore grave sexual abuse is

not a lesser offence. We are pleased with the submissions

made by both Counsel.

In dealing with question of law, it is important to note a

jugement delivered by this Court in CA 88/2002 where H/L

Justice W.L.R. Silva has held thus 'We are of the view, that

grave sexual abuse can never be considered as a lesser offence

under section 178 of the Criminal Procedure Code or as having

certain ingredients that constitute a different offence under

section 175 or as coming under section 177 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

Grave sexual abuse is a cognate offence introduced by a

separate amendment and is a specific offence having its own

ingredients. In a case of rape one has to prove penetration.

Penetration can be minimum and placing the penis between the

labia maj ora or labia minora would be sufficient. Thus to

constitute the offence of rape even a penile errection is not

3

necessary. (Vide books on forensic Pathology written by

'Narayan Renddy, Keet Simpson, Chandrasiri Nirialle etc.)

It cannot be argued that touching or placing a finger for

sexual gratificate are ingredients comprised in a charge of

rape. Because without any fingering or touching the offence

of rape could be committed. Therefore I am inclined to the

view that none of these sections in the Criminal Procedure

Code with regard to framing of charges could be applied to

justify the cause adopted by the trial judge in this case. We

also find that the accused was gravely prejudiced by the fact

that the trial judge failed to inform him of the charge of

grave sexual abuse giving him the opportunity to defend

himself on that charge. Instead the judge has at the

conclusion of his judgment arrived at a decision to convict

him for grave sexual abuse instead of rape.

This is a grave irregularity and a glaring error of law, it

cannot be condoned no excused. Therefore we are unable to

apply the proviso to article 138, or the proviso to section

334 of the Criminal Procedure Code.'

Where in a similar case my sister judge H/L K.K.

Wickramasinghe in case No. C.A 122/2013 held thus "After

considering all these facts, the evidence given by all the

wi tnesses and the dock statement made by the Appellant, the

learned Trial Judge had come to a conclusion that the

Appellant was not guilty of the offence he was indicted.

As the learned DSG had clearly mentioned in her written

submissions, tha t the Appellan t was not given an opportuni ty

to defend himself on the charge that he was ultimately

convicted on. It is so true tha t the ingredien ts of the

charge of rape are different from the ingredients that must be

proved in a charge of sexual harassment. Therefore, both the

conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned Trial Judge

are bad in law. However, although the learned Trial Judge has

adopted an incorrect procedure, he has placed reliance on the

evidence of the Victim when arriving a t a decision in this

case".

Further it was also considered following cases:-

In the case of Upul de Silva v. Attorney General 1999 (2) it

was held that "re-trial must necessarily be limi ted to the

5

offence or offences upon which the accused had been convicted

by the trial Court, and against which he had preferred an

appeal and none other. 'In the case of Banda and Others v.

Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR 168 at page 171, Justice FND

Jayasuriya held 'The issue whether a re-trial should be

ordered or not would depend on whether there ~s testimonially

trustworthy and credible evidence given before the High

Court. '

By going through proceedings it is evidence tha t he learned

High Court Judge had not taken steps to amend the indictment

and read the new charge to the Appellant. Therefore we too

agree with the preliminary objection raised by the Counsel for

the Appellant. But at this junction considering the evidence

and other legal issued it would be relevant to consider the

full case of Kahandagamage Dharmasiri Bogahahena v. The

Republic of Sri Lanka SC Appeal 04/2009 decided on 3rd February

2012, Her Lordship Justice Thilakawardane held that 'A

criminal trial is meant for doing justice to the accused,

victim and the society so that law and order is maintained. A

judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see

6

1

that no innocent man is punished. A judge also presided to

see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as

the other. Both are public duties [Ambika Prasad and another

V State (Delhi Administration) 2000 SCC Cri 522]'.

Therefore, considering the above, we set aside the conviction

and the sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge and

send this case for re-trial.

We further direct the Accused Appellant to appear before the

High Court when he receives a notice.

K.K. Wickramasinghe, J.

I agree.
