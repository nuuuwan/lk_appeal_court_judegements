DECIDED ON 10.05.2016

Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff had instituted these proceedings seeking a declaration of

title to the land morefully described in the schedule "c" of the amended Plaint

dated 8.9.1986, and for the ejectment of the defendants and those holding

under him and for damages.

The Plaintiff stated in his Plaint inter alia that:

i) The land called "Hitinawatta" was partitioned in the partition

action bearing No. 7018/P;

ii) Lots 38 and 3C of the Plan No. 1577 in the said partition action were

respectively allotted to Thepanis, the 4th Defendant and Thomis,

the Plaintiff in the said action;

iii) After the demise of the said Thepanis lot 38 devolved on his three

children namely, Siriwardena, William and Piyasena;

iv) Said Siriwardena, William and Piyasena transferred their title to the

Plaintiff under and by virtue of deed bearing No. 146 dated

06.07.1979;

v) The Defendant has encroached part of Lot 38 belonging to the

Plaintiff which is depicted as Lot 02 of the Plan bearing No. 420 and

3

morefully described in the 3rd schedule ( ) to the Plaint and

thereby caused loss to the Plaintiff.

The Defendant averred in her answer by way of counter claim that

a) In view of the partition decree lot 3C of the said Plan No. 1577 was

allotted to Thomis, the Plaintiff in the said partition action;

b) The said Thomis transferred his title to the Defendant;

c) lot 2 of Plan No. 420 which is morefully described in the 3rd schedule

was possessed by her since 1959 and accordingly has the prescriptive

rights;

The Plaintiff's claim for the title to the land in dispute is based on the

deed of transfer bearing No.146 dated 6.7.1979 and was marked as P3 and

prescriptive title on the basis of 10 years of undisturbed and uninterrupted

exclusive possession of the land.

In a rei-vindication action the Plaintiff must prove and establish his title to

the disputed land. In Wanigaratne vs Juvanis Appuhamy - 65 NlR 167_ and the

Defendant has been in possession of the disputed land. In Peeris etel vs

Savahamy 54 NlR 2007.

In this case the Plaintiff relied primarily on the paper title based on the

title deed marked as P3 along with P1 and P2 at the trial before the learned

District Judge. In addition to his paper title to the disputed land she pleaded

prescriptive title to the disputed land.

4

In Karunadasa vs Abdul Hameed 60 NlR 352, it was held that in a re-

vindicatio action it is highly dangerous to adjudicate on a issue of prescription

without first going in to and examining the documentary title of the parties. In

the instant appeal it is to be noted that the Defendant has no title deed for her

claim but her claim based exclusively on prescriptive possession.

At the trial before the learned district Judge the Plaintiff and his two

witnesses testified, whereas the Defendant had not called any witnesses on her

behalf except her. The evidence given on behalf of the Plaintiff has plausibly

proved that the title deed marked as P3 along with PI and P2 to the disputed

land and also the execution of the said P3 was not challenged by the Defendant

when it was tendered in evidence at the trial.

In Wadduwage Dharmadasa vs Manthree Vithanage Jinasena 2012 (BlR)

at page 336 it was held that in a rei-vindicatio action if no objection is taken at

the close of a case where documents are read in evidence they are all evidence

for all purposes of the law and therefore the Defendant in appeal for the first

time not entitled to challenge execution of the title deed marked as P3 at the

trial before the learned District Judge.

The Plaintiff had proved in addition to his paper title, prescriptive title to the

land in dispute. In an action for the prescriptive title the burden of proof lies on

the Plaintiff. In Sirajudeen and two others vs Abbas - 1994 2 SlR at page 365.

The Defendant at the appeal submitted that the evidence given by William and

the surveyor is contradicting each other. This contention is not tenable in law,

since the trial Judge is the Judge of facts. This position in law clearly stated in

5

Alwis vs Piyasena Fernando {1993} 1 SLR at 119 - where His Lordship G.P.S.de

Silva, C.J held thus:

lilt is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who

hear and sees the witness are not to be lightly disturbed in appeal"

Accordingly, in this case the Plaintiff had established a starting point for

his acquisition of prescriptive right over the disputed land by which the onus of

proof on the Plaintiff has prima facie been discharged and he shifted to the

Defendant to establish her title by prescription. In that process the Defendant

gave evidence on her behalf, which would not commensurate with her claim for

prescriptive title.

In the circumstances the Judgment of the learned District Judge is, in my

view eminently just and I affirm his findings on issues raised by the parties

before him. I therefore, in conclusion affirm the order of the learned trial Judge

in its entirety and I dismiss the appeals of the Plaintiff and of the Defendant.

The parties will bear their own costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Wijesundera, J.,

I agree.
