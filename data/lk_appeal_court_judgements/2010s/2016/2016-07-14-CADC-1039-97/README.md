M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hearing after referred to as the Plaintiff)

has filed this action on 26.02.1996 against the defendant. Appellant

(hearing after referred to as the defendant) in the District Court of

Panadura praying for only two reliefs.

2

tff II I t I

,

i !!It

(I) Rs.IOO, 000/= as damages from the defendant.

(2) For costs and other reliefs as the court shall meet.

This case is registered as a money recovery case. The plaintiff's storey

is that, by a judgment of District Court of Panadura in case No.17845,

he become owner of the land described in the plaint to the instant case

while the plaintiff was in possession of the land. One L.G.W.Jayasakera

made a complaint to the defendant, who is the Divisional Secretary of

Poliyandala and on this complaint, the defendant held an inquiry and

after the inquiry the defendant made an order on the plaintiff to hand

over Lot 1 in Plan No.1396, which Lot 1 is a partition of the land he

got by the judgment of the District Court in case No.17845.

The plaintiff further says that by the order of the defendant he was

disposed and thereby he has incurred damages in a sum of Rs.I 00,000/=

and this amount must be recovered from the defendant.

On 10.06.1994, the learned District Judge entered judgment in favour of

the plaintiff to claiming that the plaintiff is entitled to the lands

f i IIII

~

;!It !I I[If

described in the schedule to the plaint and the defendant must pay

damages in a sum ofRs.100/- per month from 01.03.1990.

Aggrieved by this judgment, the defendant has preferred this appeal to

this court.

Considering the averments in the plaint and the judgment entered in this

case, it is very clear that the learned District Judge has completely erred

in entering the judgment in favour of the plaintiff. In the plaint the

plaintiff has not averred any cause of action. He has not asked for a

declaration of title to the land described in the plaint and ejectment of

the defendant therefore. He has asked for compensation in a sum of

Rs.I00,000/= only but the learned judge has not the grant this amount.

If the learned District Judge has found that the plaintiff has not proved

his damages in a sum of Rs.l 00.000/- ( as the judgment not granted this

amount). The Court must have dismissed the plaintiff's action. It is

settled law that the court grant a reliefs which is not prayed for Section

40 (e) of the Civil Procedure Code enact that the plaint shall contain a

demand of the relief which the plaintiff claims. In this case, the

4

,

l

&II

\ i If

~t

plaintiff neither averred no prayed for declaration of titled and or

possession of the land described in the plaint. In this case of Surangi

Vs. Rodrig 2003 (3)Sri Lanka law Report 35.Amaratunga J. held that

"no court is entitled to or has jurisdiction to grant relief to a party which

are not prayed for in the prayer of the plaint.

I therefore hold, that the judgment entered in this case declaring the

plaintiff entitled to the land more fully described in the schedule to the

plaint is a judgment entered without jurisdiction and it must be set aside.

The next question is that the plaintiff has averred in the plaint that the

defendant is a Divisional Secretary and all the actions taken by him are

on the law of Divisional Secretary. When this refer limit has acted in his

official capacity, can the plaintiff filed the action against him on

personal capacity.

There is no prohibition under the land on filing an action to nominee is

on his personal capacity but under certain circumstances the plaintiff

will not be able to achieve which he aimed at in the action. If the

5

plaintiff knows that the defendant has acted in his official capacity as

the Divisional Secretary he should have followed the procedure

stipulated in the Civil Procedure Code.

Failure to comply with the Provision of Section 461 of the Civil

Procedure Code was considered as a absolute bar in bringing an action

against a public officer for his act purporting to be done in the official

capacity. In the instant case the plaintiff has failed to give notice of

action under Section 461 on the defendant and the Attorney-General. In

this event, the Court should have followed the procedure laid down in

Section 461 A of the Civil Procedure Code.

The defendant's act is not on his personal capacity but in his official

capacity representing the State. In the case of Blacker Vs. David 53

NLR 499, the plaintiff said the defendant in his personal capacity in

respect of a course of action which arise against him in a representative

capacity. The Supreme Court held that the action is not circumstanable.

I1Ii ! I

On 28.05.1997 the Court inquired from the defendant whether he needed

a lawyer. The defendant has answer this question whether he need the

assistance of the Attorney-at-Law in the affirmative. On this answer.

the court should have grant a date for him to seek the assistance of the

Attorney-General but the plaintiff's counsel objected to this and the

f

\

court fixed this case for trial and entered judgment on the same day. This

act of the learned District Judge is against the principle of natural Justice

and Section 460 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Further, when the defendant, as the Divisional Secretary, has acted in his I

official capacity, this plaintiff himself must have followed the procedure

stipulated in chapter XXXI of the Civil Procedure Code, which the

plaintiff has failed to do in this case. The plaint is filed contrary to the

procedure stated in the Civil Procedure Code. On the other on the other

hand, when the defendant asked court to retain an Attorney-at-Law for

him the Court should have allowed that application despite the objection

of the plaintiff's counsel.

[

when the defendant, as the Divisional Secretary, has ordered the plaintiff

to give up lot 1 in plan No.1396, when the plaintiff should have done

was, instead of filing this action to file an application for a writ of

certiorari in the Court of Appeal to quash that order. That is the

appropriate procedure. But having misconceived the law and procedure

the plaintiff has filed this action. I hold for the reasons stated above,

the plaintiff cannot maintain this action.

Appeal allowed.
