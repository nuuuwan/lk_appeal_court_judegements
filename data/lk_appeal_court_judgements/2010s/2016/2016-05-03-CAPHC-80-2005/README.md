On 23.10.2002 the 1st Complainant -Respondent -Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), Assistant Commissioner of

Labour, instituted proceedings against the Respondent -Petitioner -

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) in the Magistrate's Court

of Colombo in Case No. 41794/05 for the recovery of a sum of Rupees

Three hundred and twenty thousand (Rs.320,0001-) in respect of non-

payment of salary for the period from November 1998 to June 1999, to the

2nd Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Respondent),

in terms of Section50 (c) (2) of the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation

of Employment and Remuneration) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act)

as amended from time to time.

The issue of a certificate does not compel the Magistrate's Court to

proceed automatically to recover the sum stated: the Court must first give

the alleged defaulter an opportunity to show cause why further proceedings

for the recovery of the sum claimed should not be taken. The law thus

expressly incorporates the audi alteram partem rule.

Accordingly, when the matter was taken up for inquiry the learned

Magistrate had given an opportunity to the Appellant to show cause as to

5

why the sum specified on the certificate is not payable. The Appellant

showed cause by way of affidavit; took up the position that he is not liable

to pay the said sum of Rupees Three hundred and twenty thousand

(Rs.320,0001-) to the 2nd Respondent as he was not its employee.

The learned Magistrate in his Order held that, he has no jurisdiction to

inquire whether the 2nd Respondent was an employee or not of the Appellant

and ordered the Appellant to pay the said sum of Rupees Three hundred and

twenty thousand (Rs.320,0001-) to the 2nd Respondent in two instalments.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant filed a revision

application in the High Court of Colombo against the said Order of the

learned Magistrate. The learned High Court Judge, delivering his Judgment

on 24.02.2005, affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and dismissed

the revision application filed by the Appellant.

Thereafter the Appellant has invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this

Court to intervene by setting aside the Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge dated 24.02.2005, and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated

26.03.2004.

At the hearing of this Appeal the learned President's Counsel for the

Appellant contended that, the main grievance of the Appellant is, that, the

2nd Respondent was never an employee of the Appellant; but an independent

contractor and the learned Magistrate has not considered this position when

he made the impugned order. The learned President's Counsel further

contended as such, the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge which

affirms the Order of the learned Magistrate, is completely erroneous in fact

and in law.

6

It is the stance of the learned State Counsel for the 1 st Respondent

that, the Appellant cannot question the validity of the said certificate in those

proceedings but is given the opportunity of satisfying the Magistrate and

showing cause as to why steps for recovery of the said sum of money,

should not be taken; since the Magistrate's Court is empowered to simply

verify the particulars set out in the certificate.

Hence, the sole question arising for decision in this case is whether

the learned Magistrate has the jurisdiction to look into the matter that, the

Appellant was not an employee of the Appellant but only an independent

contractor.

It is relevant to note, that the 1 st Respondent has issued the said

certificate in terms of Section 50 (c) (2) of the Shop and Office Employees

(Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act. The Section 50 (c) (3)

of the said Act reads thus:-

"The correctness of any statement in a certificate issued by the

Commissioner for the purpose of this section shall not be called in question

or examined by Court in any proceedings under this section and accordingly

nothing in this section shall authorise the Court to consider or decide the

correctness of any statement in such certificate and the Commissioner's

Certificate shall be sufficient evidence that the amount due under sub section

(1) from the defaulting employer has been duly calculated and that such

amount is in default".

Hence, in terms of Section 50 (c) (3) of the Act, there is no provision

for the Magistrate's Court to hold an inquiry to consider or decide the

,

~ I (

!

7

correctness of statements in the said certificate except on the following

grounds:

(a) That the lack of territorial jurisdiction of the relevant Magistrate's

Court;

(b ) that the Employer has already paid the sum to be recovered;

(c) that the Employer is not liable; and

(d) that no proper particulars given in the certificate.

The following cases of both the Supreme Court as well as the Court of

Appeal have held that a certificate of this nature filed in a Magistrate's Court

for enforcement can only be canvassed and impugned on the said grounds.

(i) Attorney General vs. City Carriers Ltd; (1991) 1 SLR 227;

(ii) City Carriers Ltd; vs. Attorney General (1992) 2 SLR 257;

(iii) Mohamad Ameer and Another vs. Assistant Commissioner of

Labour (1998) 1 SLR 156.

A certificate filed in terms of the EPF Act and/or the Shop and Office

Employees Act could be impugned or controverted only on the above

grounds as enumerated by Appellate Courts.

It is relevant to note that, the Appellant has merely attempted to

impugn the said certificate on the ground that the 2nd Respondent was never

an employee of the Appellant but an independent contractor but not on the

aforesaid grounds.

The question whether the 2nd Respondent was in fact an employee of

the Appellant has been determined by the 1 st Respondent after a due inquiry

8

and an opportunity had been given to both parties to present their cases,

orally and documentarily following audi alteram rule.

The Appellant had appealed against the said Order to the Deputy

Commissioner of Labour and he had rejected the contention of the

Appellant. Therefore, I am of the view that the Appellant cannot question

the validity of the said certificate in these proceedings. The only forum

where this order could have been canvassed was by invoking the Writ

Jurisdiction of this Court, which the Appellant has failed to do.

Hence, I am of the view, by this Appeal the Appellant has sought to

challenge an administrative order again to set aside the initial order of the

Commissioner of Labour made after an inquiry.

In the course of the hearing in this Court, the learned President's

Counsel for the Appellant had sought to impress upon Court that, the learned

Magistrate has made his Order erroneously without considering the evidence

led by the Appellant showing cause as to why the amount stated in the

certificate is not recoverable from the Appellant. I am unable to agree with

the submissions made by the learned President's Counsel in the light of the

above reasoning.

F or the reasons set out above, I hold that the learned Magistrate's

Order is correct and as such there is no reason to set it aside. Therefore, it is

not necessary to interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge

who affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate.

9

Accordingly, no ground exists which justifies the intervention of this

Court to set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 26.03.2004 and

the Order made by the learned High Court Judge dated 24.02.2005.

F or the above reasons, I hold that there is no merit in this Appeal and I

dismiss it with costs of Rupees Fifty thousand (Rs.50,0001-).

I direct the learned Magistrate to execute the enforcement order

without delay.
