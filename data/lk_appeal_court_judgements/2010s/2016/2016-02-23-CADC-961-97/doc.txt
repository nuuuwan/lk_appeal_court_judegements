The plaintiff respondent had instituted a partition action in the

District Court of 8alapitiya to partition the land described in the schedule

to the plaint. After trial the learned District Judge has delivered the

judgment on 21/08/1997 and being aggrieved by the said judgment the

defendant appellants have filed the instant application.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent raised a

preliminary objection stating that there is no valid notice of appeal or

petition of appeal filed by the appellant before this court. The respondent

stated that throughout the partition case the attorney on record for the

appellants had been Mr. Kamal Jayasekera. After the judgment was

delivered one Mr. Neil Fernando had filed a notice of appeal along with a

new proxy on behalf of the appellants. The respondent submitted that

the appellants did not take steps to revoke the first proxy filed on their

behalf before filing the new proxy. The respondent stated that the

learned District Judge made a minute at the end of the relevant journal

entry that the registered attorney of the appellants did not express his

consent to revoke his proxy. The respondent submitted that under Sec.

27 (1) and (2) of the Civil Procedure Code the earlier proxy was not

revoked before filing the new proxy.

The respondent citing the judgment in Raninkumar vs Union

Assurance Ltd. 2003 2 SLR 92-98 said the laps by the appellants to

present the notice of appeal by his registered attorney goes to the basic

validity of the notice and that it is not curable in terms of Sec. 759 (2) of

the Civil Procedure Code.

The respondent also stated that the earlier attorney had given an

affidavit which was filed in the District Court stating that he requested the

appellants to meet him to sign the revocation papers but that they never

came to see him.

The learned counsel for the defendant appellants argued that the

appellants have taken every possible step to revoke the first proxy held

by Mr. Jayasekera sending a notice to him by registered post informing

him about the revocation of proxy given to him. He further stated that

due to the undue delay in filing the notice of appeal against the said

judgment by Mr. Jayasekera the new proxy was filed along with the

petition and notice of appeal. He submitted that the District Judge who

held the inquiry on the objection taken by the respondent in the District

Court did not give a ruling since the case was in appeal.

5

The appellants stated that the District Judge has made a minute

to say that Mr. Jayasekera had informed court that he was willing to

revoke the proxy given to him therefore an implied consent was given by

him to revoke the proxy.

Citing the judgment in Wanigaratne vs Dissanayake 2002 2

SLR 331 said that the appellants have given due notice to the attorney-

at-law about the revocation of proxy.

In the above case it has been decided that a party who is

dissatisfied with his registered attorney can revoke his proxy and appoint

a new attorney by following the procedure described in Sec. 27 (2) of the

Civil Procedure Code and it must be affected with leave of court and

after notice to the registered attorney. The appellants by merely sending

a letter to the registered attorney by registered post stating that they are

revoking the proxy given to him have not complied the procedure stated

in Sec. 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code. They have not taken leave of

court. District Judge has mentioned that the attorney has not refused to

revoke the said proxy but the appellants have not gone to get the said

documents signed by the attorney. Therefore the notice of appeal and

the petition of appeal have been filed by an attorney at law who had no

legal authority given by the appellants to do so. The first proxy which

6

I I I 1

was not revoked stands valid. Therefore the attorney on record is the

attorney who filed the first proxy. The petition of appeal has not been

signed by the attorney on record therefore the appellants have no locus

standi.

In Raninkumar vs Union Assurance Ltd it was stated thus;

"The lapse by the appellant's failure to present the notice of

appeal by his registered attorney goes to the basic validity of the notice

and as such is not curable in terms of the provisions of Sec. 759 (2) of

the Code .. "

For the afore stated reasons the preliminary objection raised by

the respondent is allowed. The application of the appellants are

dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,0001=.
