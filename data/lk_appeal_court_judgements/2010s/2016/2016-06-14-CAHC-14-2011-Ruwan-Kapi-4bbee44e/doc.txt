The accused-appellants were indicted before the High Court of Avissawella for committing the

offence of attempted murder of one Krishan Nalin Priyadarshana on 10th January 2003 by assaulting

him, an offence punishable under section 300 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

When the indictments were served on them, both accused-appellants elected to be tried before the

High Court Judge without a jury. At the conclusion of the High Court trial the Learned High Court

Judge Avissawella had convicted both accused and sentenced them for ten years Rigorous

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/- with a default term of 3 months simple imprisonment. In

addition to the above sentence, compensation of Rs. 300000/- was ordered on each accused with a

Prosecution in this case had mainly relied on the evidence of the injured Nalin Priyadarshana. In

addition to his evidence another witness who had witnessed the incident too had called to give

evidence along with the police and the medical evidence.

The main issue which was to be decided by the High Court was that whether the act which resulted in

inflicting a grevious injury said to have committed by the two accused as alleged by the prosecution or

whether it was an accident as claimed by the two accused.

According to the evidence of the victim Nalin Priyadarshana, he had questioned the lSI accused-

appellant with regard to an indecent proposal said to have made by him to his mother few days prior to

the incident. Since thereafter some complains have been made against the victim by the lSI accused, of

assault and also an attack on the lorry the lSI accused was working as the drive. On the day in question

both parties had gone to Padukka Police Station with regard to the complaint on the attack on the lorry.

The lSI accused was accompanied by the 2nd accused who is the husband of the owner of the lorry. The

matter was settled at the police station and they left the police station around 10.00 am.

According to the witness, he had returned home thereafter and around 12.45 he had left his house to go

to his sister's place in his uncle's three-wheeler. His uncle had dropped him at the main road and when

the witness was walking towards the bus stand he had seen the lorry driven by the lSI accused parked

by the side of the road about 25 meters away. Witness had seen both the lSI and the 2nd accused inside

the lorry. Witness continued walked towards the bus stand and at one stage he looked behind after

hearing a sound of a vehicle from his behind. At that stage he saw the lorry driven by the lSI accused,

coming towards him at a slow speed with the 2nd accused inside and all of a sudden the lorry came and

knocked down him at high speed. He was dragged for about 20 meters until the lorry was stopped.

After that the two accused who got down from the lorry and had come up to him, dragged him out and

attacked with an Iron rod. After attacking him he was put inside the lorry by the two accused and

thereafter gone to the police station and to the Hospital and admitted him to the hospital. II

The next witness summoned by the prosecution was one Baladara Arachchilage Chaminda who was

running a tailor shop at Galagedara Junction. According to him, around 1.30 pm he had gone to Meepe

Junction for some matter and on his way, after hearing a noise when he looked, he had seen the injured

being dragged by the lorry driven by the 151 accused. Witness had further seen the two accused pulling

out the injury and attacking him but he did not intervened due to fear but had taken steps to inform the

uncle of the injured about the incident.

Kaluhakuruge Hemapala uncle of the injured too have given evidence confirming the position taken

by the injured as well as witness Chaminda.

As against the said version placed before court, by the prosecution, the 151 accused-appellant whilst

giving evidence on oath testified to the effect that, he is the driver of the lorry which involved in this

incident and, the injured on several occasion had demanded money as ransom from him and due to

this, he had lodged a complaint at the police station on 10.01.2003. On the day in question he had gone

to the police station with the 2nd accused for the inquiry and the injured was warned by police on that

day. Since the injured once again threatened the 2nd accused not to use a particular road, they had gone

to the police to complain against the injured again and when they were returning at Meepe the injured

had all of a sudden jumped to the moving lorry. Even though he had tried to avoid the accident, the

injured had collided with the lorry. Thereafter they had taken the injured to the police station and on

f the instructions of police took him to the hospital and admitted him to the hospital by the 151 accused-

appellant himself.

To confirm the above position Dr. Sunil Ananda Kumara of Padukka Hospital was summoned by the

defence as a defence witness, and the said witness had confirmed that the injured Nalin Priyadarshana

was admitted to the hospital by one Ruwan Kapila Nawasinghe.

Whilst making a dock statement, the 2nd accused-appellant had corroborated the evidence given by the

151 accused-appellant.

As observed by this court the incident referred to above had taken place during the broad day light on

the main Avissawella - Colombo road closer to Meepe Junction. In addition to the injured, there is one

other witness who had given evidence corroborating the prosecution version but it is observed that he

too is an associate of the injured who had failed to intervene in the incident to rescue the injured when

he was attacked by the two accused.

In the said circumstances, what is important to consider by this court is the independent evidence place

before the trial court and to consider whether the Learned Trial Judge correctly considered the said

evidence.

In his judgment the Learned High Court Judge has considered the Medical evidence as follows "@tJ)o

From the above it is very much clear that the Learned High Court Judge was mindful of both position

placed before him when considering the Medical Evidence. He had further considered the evidence of

the investigating officer SI Senevirathne with regard to the scene observation to the effect, "t)@)

~za 63@~) ol@630l @o ...... GJ~@O~ o~~~ t::DO q l63qO)O ...... "

It is further observed by this court that whilst considering the above evidence the Learned High Court

Judge was mindful of the contradictions marked as 0-1-0-5 and the omission marked during the trial

and correctly concluded that those contradictions and omission do not go to the root of the case,

In this regard I am reminded of the decision in The Attorney General V. Sandanam Pittchi Mary

Theresa SC Appeal 79/2008 SC minutes 06.05.2010 where Thilakawardena (J) considered several

Indian authorities with regard to the admissibility of contradictions and omissions to the

effect; .... Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic version of the

witness cannot be given too much importance (Vide Boghin Bhai Hirji Bhai V. State of Gujarat AIR

1983 SC 753) witness should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies and omissions

(Vide Dashiraj V. The State AIR (1964) Tri 54)

Out of the said contradictions, the contradiction which was produced marked 0-3 with regard to the

history given to the Medical Officer, to the effect that three people attacked him, the witness when the

said position was confronted with him had said that due to his condition at that time he may have said

so and the said fact had been properly evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment. We

further observe that the Learned High Court Judge had properly evaluated the evidence given by the

f ! l !

7

1 sl accused-appellant and the dock statement of the 2nd accused-appellant and rejected the same for

well considered reasons given by him. In this regard the Learned High Court Judge had considered the

independent evidence given by the Medical Officer and the Investigating Officer with regard to the

injuries received by the injured as well as the scene observation as referred to by me in this judgment.

We further observed that the Learned High Court Judge has considered the fact that the two accused

appellants had taken the injured to the police station and hospital immediate after the incident but, was

mindful and also considered the fact that the injured was dragged for a distance which was

corroborated both by medical and police evidence and decided to rule out the possibility of an accident

as claimed by the two accused-appellant in their defence.

It is also important to consider at this stage whether the evidence led at the trial warrant a conviction

under section 300 of the Penal Code.

The Medical Officer who testified before the High Court with regard to the injuries found on the

injured person had clearly said that the injury No. 1 found on the spinal code had endangered the life

of the victims. As observed by the trial judge the victim is paralyzed and not been able to walk after

this incident.

According to the evidence of witness Priyadarshana, the vehicle driven by the lSI accused-appellant

was parked by the side of the road when he saw it for the lSI time and thereafter when he looked back

after hearing a noise had seen the vehicle coming towards him at a slow speed not on the road but right

behind him on the gravel stretch. The fact that the incident had taken place outside the road, on the

gravel stretch is confirmed by the evidence of the investigating officer. Immediately after the incident,

the two accused-appellants have pulled the injured out of the lorry and assaulted him.

When this evidence is considered with the medical evidence led at the trial it is clear that the act

committed by the lSI and the 2nd accused does not come under any other provision of law but it falls

within the section 294 of the Penal Code.

Clause 3 of section 294 of the Penal Code reads thus,

"If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury

intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death

Illustration (c) given in the Penal Code explain the said clause as follows,

(c) A intentionally gives Z a sward cut or club wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in

the ordinary cause of nature Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder although he may not

have intended to cause Z' s death.

Under the said clause it is necessary to establish two ingredients, firstly the intention and secondly the

injury inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death. As it was observed in this

Judgment, possibility of an accident is clearly ruled out and the material clearly established that the act

was an intentional act. Medical evidence has clearly established that the injury caused was sufficient in

the ordinary cause of nature to cause the death.

As observed in the case of Rahman Ismail V. Emperor AIR 1939 252 "for cases that fall within

clause (3) it is not necessary that the culprits should have knowledge of death so long as the intended

injuries are sufficient to cause death."

Under these circumstances it is correct to conclude that the material available in this case warrants a

conviction under section 300 of the Penal Code.

!

The next important issue to be considered by this court is whether the 2nd accused-appellant had

shared the common intention with the lSI accused-appellant at the time the offence had committed.

There is strong evidence before court that the 2nd accused-appellant was physically present inside the

lorry from the time the injured had first seen the lorry when it was parked by the side of the lorry.

Mter the lorry driven by the lSI accused-appellant knocked down the injured both of them had got

down from the lorry and attacked the injured.

In the case of the Queen V. Mahathun 61 NLR 54 it was held that, "to establish the existence of a

common intention it is not essential to prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a

pre-arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence without pre- arrangement. It can be

formed on the spur of the moment.

Subsequent to the attack on the injured both the accused were involved in taking the injured to the

police station and to the hospital, pretending that the injured had received the injuries due to a road

accident. These facts clearly indicates the fact that the two accused when causing injuries to the

injured had acted in furtherance of common intention shared between them.

When considering the material already discussed in this judgment, I see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the Learned High Court Judge and therefore I decide to dismiss this appeal. The conviction

and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge is affirmed.

However considering the submission made by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellants before

this court, we decided to make order directing the jail sentence imposed on both accused-appellant to

be implemented from the date of sentence i.e. with effect from 28.04.2011. Subject to the above

variation of implementation of the sentence, the conviction and the sentence imposed is affirmed.

Appeal Dismissed.
