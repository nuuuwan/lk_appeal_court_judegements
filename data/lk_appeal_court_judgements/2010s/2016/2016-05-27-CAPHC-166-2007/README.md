L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court Colombo. On the day fixed

for argument the Respondent Petitioner Appellant was present in person.

The Court inquired from him whether he has obtained the services of an

Attorney at Law, and he replied in affirmative. The Court adjourned the

hearing and granted time for him to consult and call his counsel to Court.

When the case was taken up for argument, he submitted a letter from his

counsel stating that he is appearing in other Court. The Court decided to

hear the learned DSG in support of his case, but to avoid an injustice

being caused to the Appellant due to the unethical behavior of his

counsel; Court granted an opportunity to file written submissions.

Accordingly, written submissions were filed. At this stage I wish to place

on record my disapproval on the conduct of the counsel.

The facts of this appeal are briefly as follows. The Applicant -

Respondent - Respondent (Respondent) filed action in the Magistrate

Court Colombo under State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of

1979 as amended, seeking an order for ejectment of the Respondent -

Petitioner -Appellant (the Appellant). The learned Magistrate

pronounced the order on 22.05.2007 in favour of the Respondent and

ordered to eject the Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said order of the

learned Magistrate, the Appellant filed a revision application in the High

Court of Western Province Holden in Colombo. The Appellant pleads

that his revision application was numbered as 60/2007 and always it was

called with the revision application numbered 59/2007.. He further pleads

that his revision application was due to call on 14.11.2007 but was not

called. Later he found that it was called on 26.10.2007 and dismissed for

the want of appearance of the Appellant. The Appellant on 04.12.2007

3

filed a motion together with two affidavits, (one from the Attorney At

Law who appeared and the other from the Appellant) and moved Court to

support the application. The Learned High Court Judge without giving a

hearing to the Appellant on the application to support; dismissed the

application. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court

Judge dated 04.12.2007, presented this appeal.

The learned DSG for the Respondent raised two preliminary

objections. Firstly he submitted that the appeal is time bared. In the

prayer to the petition of appeal the Appellant has sought several reliefs.

The second relief sought is to set aside the order of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 26.10.2007, by which the revision application was

dismissed. The third relief sought was to set aside the order dated

04.12.2007, by which the application to support for relist was rejected.

An order made on a default of appearing has to be set aside by the

same Court on an application presented to it. There are no rules specified

in the Civil Procedure Code or in the Appellate Procedure Rules in

relation to relisting of an appeal or a revision application. It has been held

in the case of Jinadasa and another v. Sam Silva and others [1994] 1 Sri L

R 232 that "Since there is no legislation governing the matter, the power

to restore the application to re-list is in the exercise of the Court's

inherent jurisdiction." In the instant case, the Appellant made the

application to the same Court, i.e., the High Court of Colombo, by way of

a motion with two affidavits, one by the Attorney At Law who appeared

for the Appellant on 26.10.2007 and the other by the Appellant himself,

to re list the revision application. As such, the Appellant has correctly

made the application to the same Court. The merits of that application

have to be considered by the High Court and if the parties are not

satisfied with the findings only this Court has to intervene in an appeal. In

4

the instant case, the High Court has not considered the merits. The

Learned High Court Judge refused the application to support without

giving an opportunity to present the case. The learned High Court Judge

has come to a conclusion that there is a delay in making the application

by arithmetically calculating the dates and without considering

explanation offered. Therefore this Court need not to consider the second

relief prayed for in the petition of appeal at this stage. Therefore the time

period between the order dated 26.10.2007 and the date of filing the

petition of appeal need not to be considered.

The third relief prayed for is to set aside the order dated

04.12.2007. The petition of appeal was filed on 17.12.2007, within the

fourteen day period commencing from the date of order. Rule 2(1) of the

Court of Appeal (Procedure for appeals from High Courts established by

Article 154P of the Constitution) Rules, 1998 provides that the time

period for filing of appeals against any judgment or final order is 14 days.

Accordingly, the third relief prayed for is within the appealable time.

The next preliminary objection raised by the learned DSG is that

the order canvassed against is not a final order and therefore there is no

right of appeal.

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution established the High

Courts of provinces by Article 154 P (1). High Courts established under

the said Article was vested with the appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrate Courts and Primary Courts by Article 154 P (3) (b). Article

154 P (6) of the Constitution provide for any person who is aggrieved by

a final order, judgment or sentence of any such Court, in the exercise of

its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) to appeal there from to the Court

of Appeal in accordance with Article 138.

5

154P (1) There shall be a High Courtfor each Province with effect

from the date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each

such High Court shall be designated as the High Court of

the relevant Province.

(2) ........... .

(3) Every such High Court shall (a) exercise according to law, the

original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court of Sri Lanka

in respect of offences committed within the Province;

(a) ..... .

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to

any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered

or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts

within the Province;

(c) ...... .

(4) .... , ..... .

(5) .......... .

(6) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any

person aggrieved by a final order, judgment or sentence of

any such Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4), may appeal therefrom. to the

Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138. (emphasis

added)

The rule 2(1) of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for appeals from

High Courts established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules, 1998

provides that "any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment or

r !

6

final order or sentence pronounced by the High Court in exercise of the

appeal or revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by article 154 P (3) (b) of

the Constitution may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against any

such judgment for any error in law, or in fact-" . (emphasis added)

It is against a judgment or a final order of a High Court established

under Article 154 P (1) that can be appealed to the Court of Appeal. The

order appealed against in the present case is an order refusing an

application to support an application for re list. It is not a final order. In

Chettiar v. Chettiar (SC Appeal No. lOlA 12009 SC mts 10.06.2010) it

was held that "if the decision whichever way it is given, will, if it stands

finally dispose of the matter in dispute I think that for the purposes of

these rules it is final. " In the instant case, the application to support an

application for re listing was refused. In any manner, it cannot be said

that it is a final order. Therefore, there is no right of appeal.

I uphold the second preliminary objection raised by the learned

DSG. Accordingly, I dismiss this appeal subject to costs fixed at Rs.
