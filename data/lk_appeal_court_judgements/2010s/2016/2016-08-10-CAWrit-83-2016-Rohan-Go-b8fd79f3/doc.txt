R. Chula Bandara for the Petitioner.

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C. J (PLCA)

Heard the learned Counsel in support of this application.

The learned Counsel informs that he filed the papers in the Supreme

Court and the order made by the Supreme Court is before this Court by way of

a motion. When going through the documents filed by the Petitioner, Court

observes that paragraph 42 of the petition filed in the Supreme Court is almost

identical to the paragraph 25 of the petition filed before this Court. In the

Supreme Court when the matter was supported before their Lordships on 27th

January, had decided not to issue notice on the said matter after giving due

consideration to the material placed before the Supreme Court. We see no

difference between the present application with the matter supported before the

Supreme Court since it is one and the same order which was challenged before

both these Courts. There was no subsequent development complained of in the

present application. It is further observed by this Court that the Petitioner has

come before the writ jurisdiction which is a discretionary remedy and in the

1

absence of any additional material placed before this Court, we see no reason

to issue notices in this matter.

We therefore, refuse notices in this matter. We make no order with

regard to the cost. Application is accordingly dismissed.
