P.R. Walgama, J

This appeal assails the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Hambantota, dated 10.06.2004, by

which order the application of the Petitioner for a

mandate in the nature Certiorari and Mandamus was

refused.

The facts germane to the above application to the

Provincial High Court are thus;

The Petitioner sought relief for a mandate In the

nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the order of

2

IIi

III

t

eviction sent by the 1 st Respondent, which IS marked

as Pl.

Further to compel the 2nd Respondent to hold an

inquiry as per letter marked as P2(d) by IssuIng a

Writ of Mandamus.

The above decision marked PI was arrived at by the

1st Respondent in pursuant to an application made

by one S.A. Dharmasena, being the tenant cultivator

of an alleged eviction by the Petitioner -Appellant. An

inquiry was held In terms of Section 5(3) of the

Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979.

At, the afore said inquiry, the 1st Respondent determined,

by his order dated 01.07.1982 which is marked as P2

(a) that said Dharmasena has not been evicted from the

paddy field in Issue. But it is specifically stated that

after evicting the Appellant from the said paddy

filed shall be handed over to A.A. Dayasena. (Respondent

in the above application by Dharmasena)

The aid Dharmasena preferred an appeal against the

said determination but was unsuccessful as the appeal

was dismissed by the Court of Appeal by the judgment

dated 10.11.1992.

It is seen from the said impugned order made by

the 1st Respondent by arnvIng at the determination

that there IS no eviction by the Appellant, but

nevertheless had made order to the effect that the

3 II

f

1

Appellant should be evicted and the paddy field be

handed over to A.A. DA YASENA.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner-

Appellant came by way of a writ application to quash

the above decision of the 1 st Respondent, and for a

writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to

hold an inquiry as stated by the above letter.

It IS salient to note that the Appellant was a

Respondent In the application filed by said Dharmasena

against the order of the 1 st Respondent, in the Court

of Appeal In the case bearing No. CA, 470/82. For

better appreciation, the paragraph two of the judgment

of the above case is quoted herein below;

"It appears that the proceedings in the Primary Court

has been terminated by the Primary Court Judge

holding that there had not been no dispossession of

the present Appellant and therefore he had ordered

Jayaratne to continue to work in the paddy field. The

present appellant has not apparently taken any steps

to have this order reversed. He must establish that

he had In fact been evicted by the

Respondent".(emphasis added)

The Learned High Court Judge referring to the said

judgment of the Court of Appeal has observed that

the present Appellant has not challenged the said

impugned order of the 1st Respondent, although the

4

ff!

1

said order had dealt with the eviction of the Appellant

from the paddy field in Issue.

It IS pertinent to note that the Appellant has not

assailed the said order of the 1 st Respondent in the

above application to the Court of Appeal, as such the

Learned High Court Judge held that the decision of

the 1st Respondent is final and conclusive.

In the Petition to the High Court by the Petitioner

- Appellant has averred that, at the inquiry under

42/3/93 the 2nd Respondent has adduced evidence

and subsequently had by the letter marked as P3

requested the 1st Respondent to accept the Petitioner

as the tenant cultivator. It is further stated that by

the letter marked as P2(D) the Assistant Commissioner

of Agrarian Services had informed Petitioner Chid the

2nd Respondent A.A. Dayasena to be present for the

inquiry regarding the appointment of the Petitioner-

Appellant as the tenant cultivator, on 30.08.1982. But

it IS alleged by the Petitioner - Appellant the said

inquiry has been postponed indefinitely and it was

never held by the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Services up to date.

Therefore it IS contended by the Petitioner - Appellant

that without holding the said inquiry the 1 st

Respondent IS not empowered to issue the quit notice

marked as Pl.

IIi

II

Further it IS to be noted that, although the 2nd

Respondent has requested the 1st Respondent to accept

the Petitioner - Appellant as the tenent cultivator, the

2nd Respondent has not followed the proper procedure

for the said appointment.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the

above facts, was of the view that there IS no proper

basis to issue a wit of Certiorari and a Mandamus

as urged by the Petitioner - Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

High Court Judge the Petitioner - Appellant has

appealed to this Court seeking inter alia, the following

reliefs;

To Issue a mandate In the nature of a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision marked as PI,

To Issue a mandate In the nature of a writ of

Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to hold an . . . respect of document marked P2(D). InquIry In

The said document PI refers to the eviction order

sent by the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Services.

The Learned High Court Judge has glVen adequate

reasons as to why the said order of eviction should

not be set aside by a writ of Certiorari as moved

by the Petitioner.

1 1

The said document marked PI

the inquiry held by the 1 st

was In pursuant to

Respondent in to the

application of one Dharmasena who claimed to be the

tenant cultivator, allegedly dispossessed by the Petitioner

- Appellant was held that there is no dispossession

and had dismissed the application of Dharmasena. In

the said order a reference has been made that the

present occupIer (Appellant) should be evicted and

vacant posseSSIOn should be handed over to the 2nd

Respondent. Although the said Dharmasena has

appealed against the said order to the Court of

Appeal it was dismissed. Although the Petitioner-

Appellant was the 2nd Respondent In the said

application to the Court of Appeal had not stated

his position as stated In the present application to

this Court. Therefore the Learned High Court Judge

was of the view that the Petitioner has not placed

his gnevance and now the order of Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services IS final and

conclusive. Hence In the attended circumstances there

IS no ground to interfere with the eviction order

which was made in pursuant of the order marked

as P2(A). Therefore we do not see any valid reason

to interfere with the said order.

In dealing with the Appellant's application for a writ

of Mandamus, to compel the 1 st Respondent to hold

an inquiry as per letter dated P2(D), the Learned High

Court Judge was of the view that the Petitioner has

7

not established any reasons for the Court to Issue

a writ of Mandamus.

It IS viewed from the case record that the 1 st

Respondent has not appeared nor was he represented

by a counsel. The 2nd Respondent appeared and was

represented by a counsel.

The counsel for the 2nd Respondent has adverted

court to the letter marked P2(a) wherein an order of

eviction of the Appellant has been inform by the 1 st

Respondent. But nevertheless the Appellant has not

appeal against the said impugned order P2(a).

It IS pertinent to note that Section 5 (6) of the

Agrarian Services Act which states thus;

"where no appeal is made from a decision of the

Commissioner within the time allowed such decision

shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called

in question In any court or tribunal"

Therefore

has not

judgment,

it IS abundantly

taken any step

In the above

clear that the

to impugned

said appeal

Appe1l2Rt

the

lodged

said

by

Dharmadasa. It IS common ground that the appeal

preferred by Dharmadasa to set aside the order

made by the 1st Respondent marked as P2(a) was

dismissed.

In the above setting it is intensely relevant to note

that the Appellate Court has already decided the

8

legality of the order made by the 1 st Respondent marked

as P2(a). The order of eviction Marked as PI was

sent to the Appellant pursuant to the afore said

order marked as P2(a).

The unequivocal position of the 2nd Respondent IS

that he never signed the document marked P3 and

the signature appears In the said document differs

from the signatures appearIng In the letter dated

08.09.1999 and the affidavit tendered by him. By the

afore said letter the 2nd Respondent has informed

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services that he

has not accepted rent from the Appellant, and further

the Appellant has not vacated the said paddy field.

In addition it is stated that he has not signed any

document to allow the Appellant to work In the

disputed paddy field.

As the 2nd Respondent has denied the existence of

the letter dated 11.08.1982, there cannot be an inquiry

as to the appointment of the Appellant as the tenant

cultivator.

In the said backdrop this court IS of the VIew that

as the P2(d) IS based on a document which IS

challenged by the 2nd Respondent, this Court cannot

Issue a writ of Mandamus to compel the 1 st

Respondent to hold an inquiry as per said letter

P2(d).

9

When reviewed the factual and legal matrix as stated

above this court IS of the VIew that the appeal

should stand dismissed. We order no costs.

Appeal is dismissed accordingly.
