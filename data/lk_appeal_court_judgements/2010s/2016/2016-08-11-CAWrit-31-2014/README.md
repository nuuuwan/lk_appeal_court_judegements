This is an Appeal from the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of

Ratnasiri by attacking and injuring him, an offence punishable under Section 300

of the Penal Code read with Section 32 of the said Act.

The 1 st Accused pleaded guilty to the offence and he was given a suspended

sentence and was fined Rs. 15,0001- carrying a default sentence of two and a half

years imprisonment.

The 2nd Accused was tried in absentia and after leading evidence of the

prosecution the Learned Trial Judge convicted the Appellant and he was sentenced

to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,0001- carrying a

default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

J " The instant Appeal relates to the above mentioned sentence imposed on the

2nd Accused - Appellant as the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant limited

his argument only in respect of the appeal against the sentence. When this Appeal

was taken up for hearing the main contention of the Leaned Counsel for the

Appellant was that there is a disparity of sentence between the 1 st and the 2nd

Accused.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant invokes the appellate jurisdiction of

this Court to lessen the sentence imposed on the Appellant and contests the

disparity in the term of sentence imposed on the 1 st and 2nd Accused.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant relies on the unreported case of

Hewafonsekage Priyari Sriyantha Vs. The Hon. Attorney General CA 125/2011 in

which it was held that;

"The Ft, 2nd and 3rd accused were given suspended sentences. The person

who inflicted injuries namely the 2nd Accused was also given a suspended

sentence. In our view, the fact that the 4th accused absconded from the trial

should not be considered as an additional ground when imposing the

punishment. "

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant also relies on the case of The Police

Officer, Dondra Vs. Baban 25 NLR 156 which held that "an accused, who pleads

not guilty and claims to be tried, is not to be punished when found guilty more

severely on that account, than a co - accused who has pleaded guilty. "

The Learned Counsel for the Respondent does not contest the said

contentions of the Appellant.

t Even though I agree with the concept that the mere reason of absence of an

Accused should not be taken in to consideration in deciding the sentence, I am of

the opinion that non availability of the evidence, with regard to the circumstances,

which if available could have been considered for mitigation cannot be exempted

when examining the sentence passed by the trial judge after a trial in absentia.

But in the instant case when considering the participation of the 2nd Accused

Appellant in the act of crime, it is obvious that he has been punished more severely

on the mere reason of his absence of the trial. Therefore I agree with the contention

of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant and accordingly, I affirm the conviction

but set aside the sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on the

Appellant and this court impose a term of 2 years rigorous imprisonment and

suspend the same for a period of 5 years which is to be operated from the date he

surrenders to or is produced before the Court.

Further the fine of Rs.I0, 000/= imposed by the Learned Trial Judge is

hereby enhanced to Rs. 25,000/= carrying a default sentence of six months simple

imprisonment.

The Appeal is partly allowed subject to the aforementioned variations.

The Appeal is partially allowed.
