The plaintiff respondent filed an action in the District Court for a

declaration that Deeds no. 41 and 21525 are null and void and a declaration of

title to the land in issue. The original plaintiff died and his heirs were substituted

in his place. The case was taken up for trial and judgment was delivered by

dismissing the plaintiffs action. An appeal was filed against it and the Court of

Appeal directed the District Court to have a 'de novo' trial. The trial 'de novo'

was held and judgment was delivered on 31/01/1997 in favour of the plaintiffs.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the defendant appellant have preferred

this appeal against the said judgment.

At the trial in the District Court both parties have admitted that Hector

Weerasinghe was the owner of the property in suit. that he died on 24/08/1977

and that the first plaintiff was the widow and the second plaintiff was the son of

Hector Weerasinghe.

The second plaintiff respondent giving evidence in the District Court has

stated that his father who became the owner of the land in suit on deed no. 217

(Pi) was adjudicated to be of unsound mind in the District Court of Colombo in

case no. 2221 and the first plaintiff his mother was appointed as the guardian.

and that he was warded at the Mental hospital Angoda from 1933 to 1964. After

he was discharged in 1964 he was kept in the house of O.J. Jayawardena who

was attached to the Mental hospital as a male nurse so he could be taken to

weekly clinics. After the demise of Hector Weerasinghe at the age of 85 years

in 1977 his Testamentary case was instituted in respect of his estate. The

plaintiff respondent had stated that his father during the 13 years he was staying

with Jayawardena continuously took treatment from the Mental hospital and

that his expenses were borne out by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has stated in

evidence that deed no. 41 (103) was signed by his father transferring the

property to Aron Singho in August 1977 while he was mentally unfit and 85

years old. Aron Singho was married to a niece of Jayawardena. Defendant

appellant has called Jayawardena to give evidence on his behalf and he has

testified that Hector Weerasinghe after full recovery indicated his desire to leave

the hospital and since his wife and son did not want him to stay with them he

wanted the witness to keep him. He has stated that while he stayed with them

he used to teach the children in the neighborhood English and accompany his

children to school. The witness has also stated that the plaintiffs visited Hector

Weerasinghe and paid Rs. 90/= for his upkeep and that his conduct was quite

normal. He has also stated that Hector Weerasinghe was periodically treated

for 'simple schizophrenia' and that he did not have a serious mental defect. By

consent of both parties evidence of the first defendant and Notary public given

at the previous trial had been adopted. The District Judge had accepted the

placing of the signature by Hector Weerasinghe but had stated that he was not

sane at that time, hence the deed no. 41 was void and the subsequent deed

no. 21525 based on deed no. 41 too became void. The learned District Judge

has held that the defence failed to produce any evidence that Hector

Weerasinghe was cured of his deficiency after being declared a lunatic by

Court. The District Judge had stated in his judgment that documents marked

P11 and P12 showed Hector Weerasinghe was afflicted with a mental disorder

up to the time of his death.

The counsel for the appellant submitted that Hector Weerasinghe after

being discharged from the Mental hospital led a normal life except for bouts of

depression which required minimal treatment and that Jayawardena was more

conversant with his condition than the plaintiffs according to the second plaintiff

respondent's evidence. The appellant stated that according to the testimony of

the Notary, Hector Weerasinghe had appeared normal. The appellant further

stated that the police after their investigation on the plaintiff's complaint by 102

informed the plaintiff that Hector Weerasinghe had been normal when he

signed deed no. 41.

The appellant submitted that in the light of these overwhelming evidence

it was irrational of the District Judge to arrive at a finding that Hector

Weerasinghe was still a lunatic. He stated that the District Judge had failed

to analyse the evidence led in the case.

The appellant further submitted that under our law a presumption of

continuance of lunacy can be rebutted, and that the evidence of Aron Singho

and the Notary established that Hector Weerasinghe was quite aware of what

he was doing and had given clear instructions regarding deed no. 41 .

Citing the judgment in Hamid vs Marikkar 52 NLR 269 and

Amarasekera vs Jayanethi 64 CLW 17 the appellant stated that under our law

a transaction entered during a lucid interval of a mental patient is valid due to

the presumption of lunacy raised by the adjudication can be rebutted by

evidence of restoration to reason.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondents submitted that Hector

Weerasinge was adjudged a lunatic by the District Court of Colombo and the

first plaintiff was appointed his manager, and letter of administration was given

to her. By deed no. 41 (101) he gifted the said property to the first defendant.

The first defendant's position was that this deed was executed during a lucid

interval.

The respondent further stated that when a person is adjudged a lunatic

the court must necessarily presume that he continues to be insane unless

evidence is led to establish the contrary. (Estate Rehne and others vs Pehne).

The respondent stated that in deed no. 41 the donee the first defendant is

referred to as the step son, and Hector Weerasinghe would have believed that

he married his mother and that this belief is absolutely misconceived.

The respondent's counsel submitted that the Notary while giving

evidence has admitted that he did not know Weerasinghe was declared a

lunatic by a Court of Law and that Aron Singho's evidence that he informed the

Notary that Weerasinghe was an inmate at the Mental hospital is false and it

contradicts the Notary's evidence.

Citing the judgment in Re. Bearney 1978 2 AER 395 the respondent

stated that if the defendant wishes to prove a lucid interval the burden of proving

such an interval was on the defendant and that there is no evidence whatsoever

to show that at the time the deed was executed Weerasinghe had a lucid

interval. The respondent stated under Sec. 560 of the Civil Procedure Code and

565 of the Civil Procedure Code the District Court is empowered to examine or

call for a report on the person alleged to be of unsound mind and make an order

thus the evidence of Jayawardena a male Nurse on Weerasinghe's mental

capacity should be rejected. The respondent stated the appellant did not make

an application under Sec. 578 in case no. 22211LG and that on the appellant's

own admission Weerasinghe's lunacy had not ceased. The appellant submitted

that in Soysa vs Soysa 19 NLR 314 it was held that a deed executed by an

insane person is void, therefore deed no. 41 passed no title to the first

defendant appellant accordingly the second defendant appellant even if he is a

bona fide purchases gets no title on deed 20394.

Both parties in the District Court have admitted that Hector Weerasinghe

was the owner of the property in suit and that he died on 24/05/1977 and that

first and second plaintiffs are his wife and son. The fact that Hector

Weerasinghe was warded at the Angoda Mental hospital from 1933 to 1964

was also not disputed. The fact that he was looked after by Jayawardena and

that he was treated for a mental disorder from time to time was also not in

dispute. Execution of deed no. 41 too was admitted by both parties and what

court had to decide was whether Hector Weerasinghe was in a sound mind or

lucid interval at that time. Weerasinghe was declared a lunatic by the District

Court therefore when executing a deed the Notary had a duty to examine his

mental condition. The notary has said he did not know about it. The learned

District Judge had gone into these evidence when making his findings. He had

seen and observed the witnesses giving evidence and come to the conclusion

that Jayawardena was not in a position to judge the mental condition of

Weerasinghe.

Sec. 578 (1) reads;

tlWhen any person has been adjudged to be of unsound

mind and incapable of managing his affairs, if such person or

any other person acting on his behalf, or having or claiming any

interest in respect of his estate, shall represent by petition to the

District Court, or if the court shall be informed in any other

manner, that the unsoundness of mind of such person has

ceased, the court may institute an inquiry for the purpose of

ascertaining whether such person is or is not still of unsound

mind and incapable of managing his affairs".

Sec. 578 (2) reads;

tiThe inquiry shall be conducted in the manner provided in

section 560 and the four following sections of this Ordinance;

and if it be adjudged that such person has ceased to be of

unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs, the court

shall make an order for his estate to be delivered over to him,

and such order shall be final".

The appellants have not made any application under the above section

to say Weerasinghe was of sound mind. They said he was on a lucid interval

which had not been proved at the trial since there is no evidence to say

Weerasinghe was of a sound mind when deed no. 41 was signed this deed

7 J! ,

becomes void and the subsequent deed gets no title from deed no. 41 and both

deeds become null and void.

For the afore stated reasons I see no reason to interfere in the learned

District Judge's judgment. The judgment dated 31/01/1997 is affirmed. the

appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,0001=.
