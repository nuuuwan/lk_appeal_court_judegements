L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court of Hamabanthota. The Plaintiff

Respondent -Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Respondent) made an order under section 18 (2) and (3) of the Agrarian

Services Act No. 58 of 1979 amended by Act No. 04 of 1991, to evict the

Respondent Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Appellant) from a agricultural land on a complaint made by one Edvin

Prathapasinghe Rathnayake. The appellant, being disobeyed the order, the

Respondent instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Hamabanthota to

evict the Appellant. The learned Magistrate issued the eviction order. Being

dissatisfied with the order, the Appellant moved in revision in the High

Court of Hambanthota where the application has been dismissed. This

appeal is against that order.

The Appellant, before the proceeding for eviction being instituted in

the Magistrate Court by the Respondent, filed application in the High Court

of Hambanthota case No. H.C.A.58/97 seeking for a mandate in the nature

of writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Respondent. The Learned High

Court Judge dismissed the application. Being aggrieved by the said order,

the Appellant appealed against it to the Court of appeal. The Appellant

states that he served the notice of appeal on the Respondent. The appeal is

still pending, and not yet taken up for argument. The present case is the

appeal against the order of the Learned High Court Judge in the revision

application.

The Respondent conducted the inquiry and the order was made under

the provisions of the Agrarian Services Act and after the order was made

and before eviction proceeding was instituted, the said Act was repealed and

the Agricultural Development Act No. 46 of 2000 was enacted. Can that the

Respondent institute proceedings under the Agricultural Development Act

'. 3

to evict the Appellant? Section 99 of the Agricultural Development Act has

enacted the transitional provisions. The section provides for the continuation

of the pending cases which were filed under Agrarian Services Act, under

the new Agricultural Development Act. In the present case, the decision to

evict the Appellant was made under the Agrarian Services Act and there is

no any provision to invalidate such decisions in the Agricultural

Development Act. Therefore, the order of the Respondent to evict the

Appellant from the agricultural land stands valid. There is no any

impediment in instituting action to enforce such decisions made under the

Agrarian Services Act.

Section 6 (3) of the Interpretation Ordinance also provides that

anything duly done shall not be deemed to have affected by the repeal law

unless there is express provision. The section reads;

(3) Whenever any written law repeals either in whole or part a former

written law, such repeal shall not, in the absence of any express

provision to that effect, affect or be deemed to have affected-

(a) the past operation of or anything duly done or suffered

under the repealed written law ;

(b)any offence committed, any right, liberty, or penalty

acquired or incurred under the repealed written law ;

(c) any action, proceeding, or thing pending or incompleted

when the repealing written law comes into operation, but

every such action, proceeding, or thing may be carried on

and completed as if there had been no-such repeal

In the case of Benedict and Others v. Monetary Board of The Central

Bank of Sri Lanka and others (Pramuka Bank Case) [2003] 3 Sri L R 68,

section 6 (3) of the Interpretation Ordinance has been considered and held

that;

4

Section 6(3) (b) of the Interpretation Ordinance, protects the vested

rights acquired under the repealed Act, in the absence of any

compelling language within the four corners of the repealing Act to a

deliberate decision on the part of Parliament to impair those rights,

the Monetary Board was therefore properly constituted

In the present case the Respondent issued the eviction order on a

complaint made by Edvin Prathapasinghe Rathnayake. It is the vested right

of the said complainant that the Appellant to be evicted from the agricultural

land. The Respondent has to give effect to the order by instituting eviction

proceedings in courts.

My view is that the Respondent is not prevented by law in instituting

action in respect of an order made under the repealed law.

The Appellant strenuously contested that the Respondent has not

followed the circular no. 356/91 dated 25.03.1991 issued by the

Commissioner of Agriculture and therefore the proceedings instituted in the

Magistrate Court for eviction shall be dismissed. Paragraph 32 of the said

circular instructs the assistant commissioners not to institute proceedings for

eviction if there is an appeal or a revision application from the order of the

assistant commissioner or his inquiring officer pending before the board of

review, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. This circular has no

statutory force. It is only a directive/instructive circular issued to organize

the staff and the procedure of the offices of the assistant commissioners. The

final paragraph states so.

The Appellant cited the case of Kanthilatha . v. Wimalaratne and

others [2005] 1 Sri L R 411 at 416 in support of his contention that the

learned Magistrate should not have issued the eviction order pending the

appeal. It was an appeal from the order of the High Court in a revision

5

application filed in respect of an order by the learned Magistrate. In that

case Gamini Amarathunga J. observed that:

As stated above, a party dissatisfied with the order made by the High

Court in the revision application has a right of appeal to this Court

against such order. In terms of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for

Appeals from the High Courts) Rules of 1988, such appeal has to be

filed in the High Court within 14 days from the order appealed

against. Once an appeal is filed, the High Court has to forward its

record together with the petition of appeal to the Court of Appeal. In

the meantime, as has happened in this case, the party who is

successful in the High Court may make an application to the original

Court, supported by a certified copy of the order of the High Court, to

execute the order of the High Court. Several revision application

which have come up before this Court indicate that in such situations,

some original court judges have taken the view that in the absence of

a direction from the Court of Appeal directing the stay of execution

pending appeal, the order appealed against is executable. With

respect, this is an erroneous view. It appears that the learned

Magistrate in this case has fallen into the same error when order was

made to execute the order of the High Court pending the receipt of an

order from the Court of Appeal. There is no provision or a necessity

for issuing a direction to stay execution. The filing of an appeal ipso

facto operates to suspend the jurisdiction of the original court to

execute the order appealed against.

The present case is an appeal from the order 'of the Learned High

Court Judge on a revision application filed against an order of the learned

Magistrate to evict the Appellant. There are no steps taken by the

Respondent to execute the order of the Magistrate Court. Therefore the

rational of the Kanthilatha case (supra) does not apply to this case. On the

6

other hand the appeal that the appellant is stating is not this appeal, but the

appeal filed against the order of the Learned High Court Judge in the

application for a prerogative writ. Therefore, the Kanthilatha case has no

application at all.

Under these circumstances I see no reason to interfere with the

finding of the Learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed without costs.
