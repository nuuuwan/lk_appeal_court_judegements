58 of 1081" Act No. 29 of 1983, Act No. 45 of

1992, Act No. 29. Of 1997.

As the Respondent- Petitioner, did not vacate the

As per journal entry dated 28.09.2012, revels that the

It IS apparent that the Learned Magistrate has

considered the fact that the Respondent- Petitioner did

not possess a valid permit or a written document to

possess the land in Issue.

Hence In the above context the Learned Magistrate

has issued the order for ejectment In terms Section

11(b) and 13 of the said Act.

Being dissatisfied with the said order the Respondent-

Petitioner lodged the instant application In this Court

to have the above impugned order set aside or

vacate.

The facts stemmed from the said petition are as

follows;

That the Petitioner and his family has been living in

the said premIses as an employee of JEDB (Janatha

Estate Development Board) SInce 1986.

That after the JEDB was closed there was no

successor to the premIses and had requested the then

President Chandrika Kumaratunga to gIve the said

property to him considering the long stay for 44

years In the subject premIses.

But after 8 years that there was a quit notice by the

Competent Authority of the Plantations Management

Monitoring Division, requesting the petitioner to hand

over the premises in suit.

It IS contended by the Respondent - Petitioner that the

proper application by the competent authority should

have been In the Magistrate Courts was one of

Recovery of Government Quarters Act, and not under

the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Applicant - Respondent, as a comprehensive response

to the Respondent- Petitioner's claim had stated thus;

That pursuant to the impugned order

this court.

It IS submitted by the Applicant -Respondent that at

Reform Commission. It IS stated by the Applicant that

the subject land belongs to the Ministry of Plantation

and the Competent Authority IS also from the said

Ministry. Therefore it IS the position of the

Complainant that if the Petitioner has title to the

disputed land it has to be resolved by filing an

action in the District Court.

In support of the above proposition the Complainant

has adverted court to the case of FAROOK .VS.

GUNAWARDENA GOVERNMENT AGENT- 1980 2 SLR 243

which held thus;

"the structure of the Act would also make it appear

that where the competent authority had formed the

oplnlOn that any land IS State Land, even the

Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion."

In opposIng the contention of the Petitioner that the

quit notice is illegal the Petitioner should have file a

writ application in the Court of Appeal, and therefore

it IS said that the Respondent -Petitioner IS not

entitled to come by way of Revision.

It IS seen from the petition of the Petitioner that

there IS no claim for restoration as he had been

ejected from the land In issue. Therefore the present

application of the Petitioner IS purely academic, and

has no merits to succeed in this action.
