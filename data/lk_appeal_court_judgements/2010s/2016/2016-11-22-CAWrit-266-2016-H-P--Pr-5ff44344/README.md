CA Writ 266/2016

BEFORE : Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J (PICA) &

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

COUNSEL : Vijaya Niranjan Perera for the Petitioner.

DATE : 07.10.2016

Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J (PICA)

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. According to the petitioner he is

occupying a land in Mahavilayaya modal village and has complained against an

eviction order served on him in the year 2015. The learned Counsel takes up

the position that the eviction order referred to this application had been issued

by the 1st respondent without having powers to issue the same. His position is

that the said land belongs to the National Housing Development Authority and

therefore, the Divisional Secretary of the area has no jurisdiction to evict him.

However, the petitioner has failed to submit any document before this Court to

establish that the said land belongs to NHDA, and that he has obtained the

said land from the NHDA. The document produced marked Pll only refers to

the land allocated to community center of the modal village, but not the land

occupied by the petitioner. We further observe that the said eviction order was

issued in January 2015 and it refers to the four boundaries of the said land as

State land. Therefore, it is clear that land claimed by the petitioner is

surrounded by State land and not within a model village as claimed by him.

When the papers were filed in January 2015 to evict him, has gone before the

Magistrate's Court and agreed to leave the premises and accordingly the

Magistrate had made the eviction order. We observe that the petitioner is

rather late in the day to come before this Court seeking the relief as prayed for.

He has waited one year and eight months after making the eviction order. In

these circumstances, we are not inclined to issue notices on the respondents.

The petitioner's application is accordingly dismissed.

No cost is ordered.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

I agree.
