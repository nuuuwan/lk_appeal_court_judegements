This is a revision application against the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Gampaha. The Petitioner - Petitioner's (the Petitioner) son is

the 3rd suspect in the case before the Magistrate Court Gampaha where he

was suspected for an offence of robbery using fire arms. The application

presented by the Petitioner to the High Court of Gampaha to release the 3rd

suspect on bail, was dismissed. Being aggrieved, the petitioner presented

this revision application to revise the order of the Learned High Court

Judge. The learned SSC raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner

has no locus standi to maintain this application.

The Petitioner filed this revision application to revise the order of the

High Court. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot bring in any new material in to

this application other than the material presented to the High Court. A

question of law can be raised but not new facts. The application of the

Petitioner has to be considered on that basis.

The Petitioner, in her application in the High Court, stated that she is

a divorced lady living with her son, the 3rd suspect and running a beauty

parlour for her livelihood. She further stated that the 3rd suspect is a boy of

20 years of age. Most importantly, she requested the High Court to grant

bail on the 3rd suspect because she had to live alone w.ithout any protection

and she was mentally depressed due to the incarceration of her son, the 3rd

suspect.

Can a person ask Court to release another person on bail for the whole

benefit of the first person? My view is that he cannot. A person has no locus

3

standi to make such an application. The petitioner is not a party to the

proceeding before Magistrate Court. She cannot come to a higher court and

complain that she is undergoing difficulties due to the incarceration of her

son, who is a suspect of a case of robbery using fire arms, and to seek the

indulgence of the Court to release him on bail.

The Oxford Dictionary of Law defines the English meaning of the

Latin term "locus standi" as "a place to stand'. Its legal definition is "The

right to bring an action or challenge a decision". The Wharton's Concise

Law Dictionary revised and updated by Dr. Justice AR Lakshmanan, former

Judge of the Supreme Court of India defines the term as "The right of a

party to appear and be heard on the question before any tribunal". The

Black's Law Dictionary defines as "The right to bring an action or to be

heard in a given forum".

In the present case, the Petitioner, in the application for bail in the

High Court, has not given any reason from the point of the 3rd suspect as to

why he should be released on bail. She made the application completely for

her benefit. She has no right to make such an application.

The authorities referred to by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

has no relevancy to the present point in issue.

I uphold the objection and dismiss the application. No costs.
