The plaintiff appellant instituted action in the District Court of Galle

seeking a declaration of title to lots 2A and 2B the land shown in plan no. 1055,

which the plaintiff alleged the defendant forcibly encroached and is in

possession cutting down trees. The defendant respondent averred long and

undisputed possession. The trial was taken up on 13 issues the main issue

being whether the defendants have prescribed to lots 2A and 2B. At the trial the

plaintiff and the surveyor of plan no. 1055 have given evidence on behalf of the

plaintiff marking documents P1 to P5. For the defense the defendant has given

evidence marking documents 101 and 102. After trial the learned District

Judge has answered the issue infavour of the defendant.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the plaintiff proved

his title and the defendant who claimed prescriptive title to lots 2A and 2B who

had no paper title had to prove his prescriptive title. The District Judge in his

judgment has stated that the plaintiff is a co owner of lot 2 and that his title to

lot 2 was not contested by the defendant. The defendant only claimed lots 2A

and 2B on prescriptive rights.

The appellants stated that when the plaintiff claims the entire land and

the court finds he owns only a share and the defendant is a trespasser the

plaintiff is entitle to a declaration that he is entitle to a share of the land and the

eviction of the defendant from the corpus. The judgments in Bernard vs

Fernando 16 NLR 438, Hariet vs Padmawathie 91 (1) SLR 358 and

Attanayake vs Karunawathie 2003 (1) SLR 401 were cited. The argument of

the appellant was that since the District Court found that the plaintiff was

entitled to a share of the corpus it was for the defendant to prove his

possession and prescriptive title to a part of the land.

:/ The appellant further submitted that on behalf of the defendant only the

defendant's evidence was given and no evidence was given to support his

evidence on possession. The appellant stated that the learned District Judge

has ignored the fact that the case was a rei vindicatio action and not a definition

of boundaries case. The appellant submitted that the defendant had not

satisfied the requirements of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance by proving

adverse possession of lots 2A and 28, and that the mere statement of posses

is not enough and cited the judgments in Juliana Hamine vs Don Thomas 59

NLR 546 and Alwis vs Perera 21 NLR 326 and Karunasekera vs Abdul

Hameed 68 NLR 352.

The appellant stated that the learned District Judge failed to address his

mind to physical possession of lots 2A and 28 by the defendant and has

granted a declaration of title to the defendant when it has not been prayed for

by the defendant. The appellant stated that there has been no evaluation of

facts on possession.

The learned counsel for the defendant respondent submitted that the

defendant's position in the District Court was that even if the plaintiff and her co

owners and their predecessors in title may have had paper title to lots 2A and

28 that title had been extinguished by prescription thereof by the defendants

and their predecessors in title.

I!

The respondents stated that the District Judge's finding that the plaintiff

was only a co owner of the said lot 2 was based on the plaintiffs own

documents P1 and the plaintiffs evidence.

The respondent stated that no where in the District judge's judgment a

declaration of title granted to the defendant, but only a finding to that effect

which does not amount to granting of a declaration to that effect.

The respondent stated that the claim of prescriptive possession by the

defendant was proved by the evidence regarding the boundary dispute in 1976

where it was found that the row of boundary trees was 20 years old and that

the District Court action was filed in 1986.

The respondent on adverse possession stated that the plaintiffs attempt

to oust him in 1976 and the defendant holding possession despite attempts to

oust him makes it certain that he had held adversely to those who disputed with

him. The respondent further submitted that the defendants were not agents or

co owners of the plaintiff and the possession by the defendant did not amount

to a possession by a co owner. The respondent possession on their own is for

their own benefit. The respondent stated that there is no requirement to

corroborate the evidence given on prescription since the plaintiffs evidence

itself corroborated the defendant's evidence on possession.

I ,

The surveyor's report to plan no 1055 dated 04/07/1988 and the

surveyors evidence at the District Court trial reveals that lots 2A and 2B are

parts of lots 2 in the original plan in 1956 and that the defendants are in

possession of the said lots. A wire fence was found on part of the boundary

enclosing 19 trees, which the defendant and plaintiff both had claimed in the

District Court.

The defendant respondents have claimed only prescriptive title to lot 2A

and 2B which the learned District Judge has granted after trial. The plaintiff

herself has admitted in evidence that the defendants are in possession of the

said lots and have been in possession since 1976. The defendants have not

disputed the plaintiffs title to lot 2 of the said plan. The learned District Judge

after evaluation of evidence and documents have decided that the defendants

are in possession of lots 2A and 28 and have prescribed to the said land.

Which I find is correct on perusal of the evidence place before the District

Court.

The appellant stated that the learned District Judge has given a

declaration of title on lots 2A and 28 to the defendants without them asking for

it. On perusal of issue no. 10 which was the main issue in the said trial and the

answer given I find that the learned District Judge has merely answered the

issue in question and not made any declaration of title. It is the finding of the

learned District Judge.
