The petitioners have filed this application praying to revise or set

aside the judgment delivered on 04/03/2003 and also to set aside the

interlocutory decree and the final decree entered in case no. 483/P in the

District Court Homagama. This application has been filed three years

after the judgment was delivered in the said partition action.

The first and second defendants in the partition action are mother

and brother of the petitioners in the instant application.

The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted when the first

defendant in the partition case died her son the second defendant was

substituted without bothering to find out all the heirs of the decreased

which caused a grave prejudice to the rights of the petitioners who are

children of the deceased first respondent.

The counsel for the petitioners stated that the real dispute was in

regard to the corpus and not the pedigree and that the plan marked X

showed a larger land but the parties failed to take steps under Sec. 19

(2) of the Partition Act which caused prejudice to the petitioners, which

4

f

resulted in a patent lack of jurisdiction. He stated that there has been no

investigation of title.

The counsel further stated that there has been a fundamental vice

together with a patent lack of jurisdiction therefore the petitioner's

revision application should be allowed.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the

diseased first defendant respondent was the mother of the petitioner and

the second defendant respondent is the brother of the petitioners and

the corpus was in regard to their ancestral property therefore the

petitioners cannot say that they were unaware of the partition action. He

further stated that this partition action was highly contested which lasted

nine years and the judgment was delivered in favour of the plaintiff nine

years prior to this revision application. The respondents stated that there

is an unexplained delay in filing this application and that the petitioners

have not stated in their petition that they had no contacts with the mother

and the brother therefore they can not say they were unaware of the

partition action.

The respondents further submitted that the issues taken up in the

instant application were raised in the District Court by the first and

second defendants and that the District Judge has dealt with them in

detail and the instant application was filed by the petitioners in collusion

with the second defendant. He stated that after the final decree some of

the parties have sold their rights to third parties.

The petitioners have filed the instant application to revise or set

aside a judgment delivered on 04/03/2003 which was delivered three

years prior to the instant application. The first and second defendants in

the District Court action are mother and brother of the petitioners and the

land involved was their ancestral property. The argument of the

petitioners were that after the death of their mother the first defendant

without looking for all the legal heirs, the plaintiff in the said case

substituted the second defendant their brother in place of the deceased

mother and this has greatly prejudiced their rights. The petitioners who

obviously knew about the partition action should have taken steps to

intervene in the partition case when the mother died. After sleeping over

their rights for so long they can not now come and say their rights have

been affected.

The petitioners have filed the instant application three years after

the judgment was delivered and have not given an acceptable reason for

the long delay. After judgment the Interlocutory and Final decrees were

entered and after the final decree only the petitioners have decided to

6

t

f

f

challenge the said judgment. The petitioners have failed to prove the

requirements stated in Sec. 48 of the Partition Act to revise the said

judgment. They have stated that the pedigree has not been properly

analyzed by the District Judge, if that is so they should have appealed

against the said judgment at that time. They have been silent until the

land was surveyed for the final partition. They have been fully aware of

the partition action but did not attempt to intervene in the said action until

the final partition.

The petitioners have failed to prove exceptional circumstances to

grant revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to refuse the application of

the petitioners with costs fixed at Rs. 50,0001=.
