P.R.Walgama, J

This appeal IS directed against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 01.06.2011 and the

order of the Learned Magistrate dated 30.01.2009.

The Complainant - Respondent filed a Certificate In the

Magistrate Court of Wellawaya In terms of Section

38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15

of 1958 as amended by Act No. 08 of 1971 9_nd

No. 01 of 1985, for the recovery of sum of Rs.

1913273.80 (as stated In the document marked as Xl)

as the Provident fund and surcharge due to the

employees of the Respondent Company.

Pursuant to the filing of the above certificate, the

Learned Magistrate has issued summons on the

Respondent to show cause as to why the said

amount should not be recovered from him.

It was contended by the Complainant that once the

certificate IS tendered to Court, the Court should

take steps to recover the atnount stateJ

The Counsel for the Respondent has urged Court to

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent-

Petitioner has made an application in Revision to the

Provincial High Court In Uva Province holden at

Monaragala, seeking to vacate the said order of the

Learned Magistrate In the case No. 40255 In the

Magistrate Court Wellawaya.

The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

01.06.2011 has granted relief sought by the

Respondent- Petitioner by setting aside the order of

the Learned Magistrate as stated above.

The Learned High Court Judge has based his

determination what was envisaged In the case of

KODAGODA ARATCHIGE DAYAWATHI .VS COMMISSIONER

GENERAL OF LABOUR- decided on 10.06.2009 in F jR

-241/08.

It IS stated In the said Judgment that as per

Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, in

filing action the Plaintiff should comply with the

Section 17 to 38(1) by instituting action In the

District Court. Further more there must be a

certificate filed In the Magistrate Court along with

the plaint.

It was thus held in the said case;

"The 3rd Respondent had no jurisdiction or power

under the said statute to file a certificate In the

Magistrate's Court In terms of Section 28(2) 0f ~hc

EPF Act without first proceeding under Section 17

and thereafter under Section 38(2) of the said

Act."(emphasis added)

Therefore it was held by the Learned High Court

Judge that the Plaintiff should first file action in the

Being aggrieved by the said order the Complainant-

Respondent - Petitioner made this application by way

of Revision seeking to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge accordingly.

It is averred by the Petitioner that the Learned High

Court Judge had erred In law by misinterpreting the

contents of the Supreme Court Judgment dated

01.06.2009 In case of Dayawathi .vs. Edirisinghe

which has expressly stated and had recognised thus

"that if only the Commissioner is of the oplnlOn that

recovery under Section 17 of the said Act IS (1)

impracticable and inexpedient, and/ or (2) where the

full amount due has not been recovered

and sale, only then can recovery be made".

!

Therefore it is contended by the Petitioner- Appellant

that the Learned High Court Judge has erred in law

In acting under Section 38(2) without being satisfied

with the fact that the Commissioner of Labour has

himself considered whether it was impractical and

inexpedient to take steps under Section 17 and 38(1)

of the EPF Act, before proceeding to file a certificate

In terms of Section 38(2) of the said Act. Hence it

IS stated that In the above case the determination of

the said case IS only an 'obiter dicta' and not the

'ratio decidendi'.

It IS apparent that the present application to this

Court is by way of a Revision although the right of

appeal was available to him. But it IS stated that

due to the delay In obtaining the relevant document

from the High Court the appealable period had

lapsed. Therefore the Complainant - Respondent - Petitioner

has come by way of Revision to this Court.

The Petitioner has

It IS further contended by the Petitioner - Appellant

It also intensely relevant to note that the Respondent

has to deposit with the Complainant a colossal

amount of money as revealed by the document

marked Xl.

Therefore in the above context it is worthy to mention

that the Learned High Court Judge has interpreted

erroneously the Section 38(2) of the said Act.

In the above setting this Court IS of the view that

the Learned High Judge's order IS perverse and

~ould be set aside, and allew the Application of the

Complainant-Respondent-Petitioner be allowed and should

Application is allowed.
