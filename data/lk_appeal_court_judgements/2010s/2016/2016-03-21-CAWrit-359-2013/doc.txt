JUDGMENT

P. Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner and the 8th Respondent are brothers. Their father,

Waduge Jinasena is the holder of the permit marked P 1 issued by the

Divisional Secretary under Section 19 (2) of the Land Development

Ordinance. That permit (marked P 1) does not contain a name of a

successor to hold the rights of said Waduge Jinasena after his demise.

4

Learned counsel for the Petitioner, learned counsel for the 8th

Respondent and the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the

other Respondents are in agreement;

(i) that the document P 1 is a copy of the original permit issued

to said Waduge Jinasena (father of both the petitioner and

the 8th respondent).

(ii) that said Waduge Jinasena has not nominated any successor to

his rights under this permit.

(iii) that this permit has been issued on 1991. 01. 15.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner drew the attention of this court to the

documents marked P 5 and P 14 also. These two documents are said to

be subsequently obtained copies of the same permit. However, in both

P 5 and P 14, name of the 8th Respondent has been mentioned as the

sole successor to the rights of Waduge Jinasena.

It is the position of the 8th Respondent that Waduge Jinasena had taken

steps to nominate the 8th Respondent as his successor to his rights

under this permit at a later stage namely on 1994-07-05. Said Waduge

Jinasena had passed away in 1997.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st -7th

Respondents in the course of his submissions referred to the document

marked 2 R 2 which is a copy of the Land Ledger maintained at the

office of the Divisional Secretary in which the details relating to this

permit has been entered. It is the submission of the learned DSG:

1. that Waduge Jinasena had not nominated any successor at the

time of the issuance of this permit on 1991-01-15,

5

II. that said Waduge Jinasena had nominated the 8th Respondent as

his successor to his rights under this permit on 1994-07-05,

III. that due to the above nomination the name of the 8th Respondent

was inserted as the permit holder on 2008-04-09 (the date

mentioned on the document 2 R 2)

To the contrary it is the submission of the Petitioner that these

alterations on the permit and the Land Ledger have been effected

fraudulently.

The positions taken up by the Petitioner and the 8th Respondent show

that they dispute the major facts pertaining to the question as to who

should be the successor to the rights of Waduge Jinasena.

All parties admitted that this dispute namely the dispute as to who

should succeed to the rights of said Waduge Jinasena under this permit

is the core issue in the District Court case pending between the parties.

Therefore, the best course of action available to all the parties

undoubtedly is to participate in the pending District Court case and

vindicate their rights. That is the most effective way to finally settle this

dispute as all parties get the opportunity of not only calling the

witnesses on their behalf, but also to cross examine the witnesses called

on behalf of their opponents.

Learned DSG drew the attention of this court to the case of Thajudeen

Vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another [1981 (2) SLR 471].

The Case above referred to, is also an application for a writ of

Mandamus. This court in that case has taken the view that when the

major facts are disputed by parties, the most appropriate procedure for

the settlement of such a dispute is an action by way of regular

6

procedure before the appropriate court of First Instance. This court in

that judgment has also taken the view that such an action by way of

regular procedure also constitutes an "equally convenient, beneficial and

effective" remedy. This court in the exercise of its discretion had refused

the application for writs in that case on this ground.

Bearing in mind the core issue to be decided in the pending District

Court case, with regard to this dispute, it is important at this stage to

turn to the prayers of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner in his application inter alia has prayed for,

1) a mandate in the nature of Writ of certiorari against the 1st

and/or 2nd respondent cancelling and/or nullifying the nomination

of the 8th respondent as the successor to permit No. 243/ 273 and

granting him the 1st instance permit holder status.

2) the quashing of the decision of the 2nd respondent declining to

hold an inquiry to rectify the wrongful succession of the 8th

respondent.

3) a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the

1 st and/or 2nd respondents to restore the petitioner's right of

succession to the said land alienated to his father under Permit

No. 243/273

4) a declaration that the nomination of the 8th respondent as the

successor to permit No. 243/ 273 and granting of 1st instance

permit holder status invalid and has no legal effect.

5) a direction on the 1st / or 2nd respondents to delete the

nomination of 8th respondent as the successor to land under

7

permit No. 243/ 273 and granting him the 1st instance permit

holder status, from the register of permit/ grant, ledger/ relevant

folio of the land registry under the Land Development Ordinance.

In order to grant the reliefs the Petitioner has prayed for in the above

prayers this court first has to arrive at a conclusion that the Petitioner is

the lawful successor to the permit marked P 1. In other words, coming

to a firm finding after due inquiry as to who is the lawful successor to

the impugned permit is a pre requisite, before this court could consider

issuing any Writ.

In D.P. Palisena vs K.K.D. Perera (56 NLR 407), it was held that a permit

holder under the Land Development Ordinance is entitled to maintain a

vindicatory action against a trespasser. Gratien J' s following passage in

that jUdgment" ... it is very clear from the language of the Ordinance and

from the particular permit P 1 issued to the plaintiff that a permit holder

who has complied with the conditions of his permit enjoys, during the

period for which the permit is valid, a sufficient title which he can

vindicate against a trespasser in civil proceedings .... " has been cited with

approval by Somawansa J in Bandaranaike vs Karunawathie [2003 (03)

SLR 295].

lime and again courts have held that the Writ jurisdiction of this court is

a discretionary one. This has been clearly explained by Jayasuriya J in

Jayaweera vs Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura

and another [1986 (2) SLR 70] when he said " .... I hold that the

Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of

Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of

right or as a matter of routine .... "

8

Further the Writ jurisdiction of this court is an extra ordinary jurisdiction

and this court will decline to exercise it particularly when there are other

means of obtaining justice. As mentioned above in this case, there is not

only an alternate remedy which is equally convenient, beneficial and

effective available for the Petitioner, but that alternate remedy (i.e. a

regular action in the District Court) has already been accessed by the

relevant parties also.

For the foregoing reasons Petitioner's application for a writ of Certiorari

and Mandamus is not entitled to succeed. This application is therefore,

refused and it should stand dismissed.

Taking into consideration all the circumstances of this case we make no

order for costs.
