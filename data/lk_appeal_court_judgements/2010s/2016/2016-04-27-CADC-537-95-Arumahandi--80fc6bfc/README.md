Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

This matter IS commg up by a motion filed by the

Proposed Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner seeking an

interpretation with regard to the order made by this Court abating the

proceedings on 31.03.2006. It is observed from this case record that

this case which is a District Court final appeal from the District

Court of Balapitiya in Case No. 265/P had come up before this Court

prior to 31.03.2006 on several occasions with notices for the parties

and their Registered-Attorneys. However it is observed by this Court

when the matter came up on 31.03.2006 it was observed by Court that

the petitioner-appellant had not taken any interest in prosecuting this

matter. The Court after considering the journal entry made by the

relevant subject clerk and also considering journal entries previously

minuted in the docket, has decided to abate the proceedings m this

Court. Subsequently considering the fact that there was no appeal

against the said order of abatement the Court had sent back this case

to the District Court of Balapitiya on 21.06.2007.

Learned Counsel for the proposed substituted plaintiff-

respondent-petitioner brings to the notice of Court of an order made

by the District Judge of Balapitiya on 08.07.2015 which is produced

in his motion dated 18.01.2016 marked 'C'. According to the said

order it appears that the District Judge IS awaiting a decision from

this Court even though the proceedings are abated by this Court and

returned the record back to the District Court of Balapitiya. As

observed by this Court the order to abate the appeal was made as far

back as on 31.03.2006, but since then the petitioner-appellant has not

taken any steps to come before this Court or go before the Supreme

Court against the said decision. The said decision is arrived by this

Court mainly due to the fact that the petitioner-appellant has failure

to prosecute this matter before this Court. Learned Counsel appearmg

for the Proposed Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner brings to

the notice of Court the provisions in Section 402 of the Civil

Procedure Code which allows the District Court for abatement when a

party fails to take a step for 12 months.

When considering the above provIsIOns the Court finds

that the failure by the parties especially by the petitioner-appellant in

this matter to prosecute the case prior to 2006 as well as after 2006

clearly indicates their inaction in this matter. When considering these

facts, this Court is of the VIew that the only interpretation this Court

can give with regard to the Order made by this Court on 31.03.2006

is that the appeal before this Court has been dismissed.

Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the

learned District Judge of Balapitiya. Registrar is further directed to

Issue today's proceedings to the Proposed Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent-Petitioner on payment of usual charges.
