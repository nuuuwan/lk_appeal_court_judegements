Malinie Gunaratne, J.

This is an Appeal filed by the 1 st Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellant) against the Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge of Ham ban tot a, dated 06.06.2007.

When the Appeal came up for hearing on 08.05.2015, the learned

Counsel for the Respondent raised the following two preliminary objections

with regard to the maintainability of the instant Appeal.

1. The Petition of Appeal has not been filed by the 1 st Respondent

- Appellant himself or by his registered Attorney in terms of the

Court of Appeal Rules, 1988.

11. There is no valid appeal before this Court as the necessary

parties are not before this Court which is a violation of Court of

Appeal Rules, 1988.

After conclusion of oral submissions by Counsel, parties have

tendered their written submissions which have been filed.

The first question which arises for decision is as to whether the

Petition of Appeal contravened Rule 14 of the Court of Appeal Rules 1988

as it has not been signed by the Appellant or his registered Attorney-at-Law.

The facts with regard to the issue are as follows:-

The Notice of Appeal has been filed in the original Court (High

Court) by Mr. H.A. Amarasena the Appellant's Attorney-at-Law.

Subsequently, the Petition of Appeal had been lodged on 03.08.2007.

Together with the Petition of Appeal, revocation of proxy given in the name

4

of the said Mr. H.A. Amarasena and a fresh proxy had been tendered along

with a motion. The Motion was received by the learned High Court Judge on

07.08.2007, according to the date stamp on it. The Petition of Appeal had

been signed by Mr. Chaminda Sooriyapatabendi Attorney-at-Law. The

learned High Court Judge, on 07.08.2007 had ordered that the Petition of

Appeal and the said fresh proxy be filed of record; and the case record be

sent to the Court of Appeal.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent contends, the issue that arises

here is to determine who the Appellant's registered attorney was on the day

the present appeal was filed (on 03.08.2007). The learned Counsel for the

Respondent elaborating on the objection raised, contends that the appeal is

fatally defective as the Petition of Appeal has not been signed by the

Appellant's registered Attorney on record on 03.08.2007 in terms of Rule

12(2) and therefore, the same is liable to be rejected in limine.

It is the stance of the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant

that the Counsel for the Respondent is trying to rely on technicalities. The

gist of the submissions of the learned President's Counsel was that the

Petition of Appeal in this case has been signed by the Attorney on record

and therefore, it is pertinent to look into the merits of the case rather than

confining oneself to rigid rules that would clearly disturb the process of this

Court in reaching justice. Learned President's Counsel further contends,

that according to Rule 14 of the Court of Appeal Rules of 1998, there is no

requirement to obtain the permission of Court to file a fresh proxy when the

proxy of the previous registered Attorney is revoked.

5

However, it is relevant to consider the manner in which a proxy can

be duly revoked is stipulated in Section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Though the present Appeal stems from a judgment delivered by the

Provincial High Court, the position with regard to filing and revocation of

proxies should follow Section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The instrument of appointment of a registered attorney is substantially

in terms of Form No.7 of the First Schedule to the Civil Procedure Code and

is commonly referred to as a "Proxy". In Mohideen Ali vs, Cassim 62

N.L.R. 457, Basnayake C.J. held, the proxy is required to be filed in Court

(Section 27 (1) CPC) and "when so filed, it shall be in force until revoked

with leave of the Court and after notice to the registered attorney by a

writing signed by the client and filed in Court, or until the client dies, or

until the registered attorney dies, is removed or suspended, or otherwise

becomes incapable to act, or until all proceedings in the action are ended and

judgment satisfied so far as regards the client.. ... " (Section 27 (2) Civil

Procedure Code).

It was not in dispute that the proxy filed in this matter was in force

when the notice of appeal was filed and that the Petition of Appeal was

signed by the new Attorney Mr. Chaminda Sooriyapatabendi and not by the

Attorney Mr. H.A. Amarasena who was on the record on 03.08.2007. The

question which arises for decision is now who was the Appellant's registered

Attorney on the day the present Appeal was filed.

It was not in dispute that the Petition of Appeal had been filed on

03.08.2007 and along with it, revocation of proxy given in the name of the

said Mr. H.S. Amarasena and a fresh proxy of Mr. Chaminda

6

Sooriyapatabendi had been tendered along with a motion. The Petition of

Appeal was signed by the new Attorney-at-Law Mr. Chaminda

Sooriyapatabendi.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondent is that the

Petition of Appeal has not been signed by the Appellant's Attorney on

record on 03.08.2007 in terms of Rule 12(2). As such, the appeal is fatally

defective and liable to be rejected in limine.

The learned Counsel in support of the above submissions relied on the

decision of Silva vs. Kumaratunga 40 N.L.R. 139. It is relevant to note, the

facts of that case are similar to the issue at hand. The Plaintiff - Appellant's

proctor, Mr. M.A. Van Rooyen, by a motion dated November 11, 1937,

moved to revoke the proxy granted to him by the Plaintiff. The motion was

according to the date stamped on it, received by District Court on November

13, 1937. It was brought on the roll and allowed by the Court on November

15, 1937. The Petition of Appeal was filed on November 12, 1937. It was

not signed by the proctor who was on the record on November 12, 1937. A

preliminary objection was taken on the ground that the Petition of Appeal is

not signed by the proctor who was proctor on the record on the day the

appeal was filed, November 12, 1937.

It was held in that case, a petition of appeal must be signed by the

proctor, whose proxy is on the record at the date on which the Petition is

filed. In the cases of Wace Vs. Angage Helana Hami (1881) 4 S.C.C.48

and Romanis Bass vs. Raveena Kader Mohideen and Another (1881) 4.

S.C.C.6) also, it was held that the petition of appeal must be signed by the

proctor on the record.

In the said cases, the objection was upheld and the appeal was

dismissed. Eunis J., in Reginahamy vs. Jayasundara (1917) 4 C.W.R. 390,

rejected an appeal which was not signed by the proctor on the record.

It is important to note, in the case at hand, the Petition of Appeal was

not signed by the Attorney-at-Law who was Attorney -at-Law on the record

on the date the appeal was filed. Even though the new Attorney-at-Law had

filed a motion along with the Petition of Appeal he has not moved to support

it or to revoke the earlier proxy. He has only moved to file the papers in the

record. On a perusal of the Journal Entry dated 07.08.2007, the learned

High Court Judge also has not made any order giving permission / leave to

revoke the earlier proxy and accepting the new proxy. He had only made an

order to file the fresh proxy and the petition of appeal and send the case

record to the Court of Appeal.

Accordingly, I am of the view that as the Petition of Appeal has not

been signed by the Appellant's Attorney on the record on 03.08.2007, the

Appeal is fatally defective and liable to be rejected.

An appeal is a crucial step in the proceedings. The view of the Court

is that the defect is not of a purely formal or technical nature as submitted by

the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant.

For the reasons stated above, I uphold the First Preliminary Objection

raised by the Counsel for the Respondent. This Appeal is dismissed

accordingly.

8

Since this Court has dismissed the Appeal for the above stated

reasons, this Court is of the view that it is not necessary to go into the

Second Preliminary Objection.
