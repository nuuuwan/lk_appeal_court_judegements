L. T .B.Dehideniya J

This is a revision application against an order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Kandy. The learned Counsel for the Respondent-

Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter sometime called and referred to as the

Petitioner) supported this application for notice and for an interim order

restraining the learned Magistrate from executing the impugned order

dated 01.10.2013. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter sometime called and referred to as the

Respondent) objected to issuing notice as well as interim order. Both

Counsels were heard and were directed to submit written submissions and

was complied with. This order is in relation to the issue of notice and the

interim order.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The Petitioner and the

Respondent both are lessees of two blocks of the same land belongs to the

Gangarama Raja Maha Viharaya temple. The two blocks of lands

depicted in the plan No 478 A dated 23.09.2002 prepared by U. Was ala

Licensed Surveyor. Lot 1 of the said plan was leased to the Petitioner by

deed No. 3053 dated 12.03.2004 attested by Tikiri Banda Harindranath

Dunuwila Notary Public and the lot 3 was leased to the Respondent by

deed No. 3052 of the same date attested by the same Notary Public. The

lot 2 of the said plan is depicted as roadway. The Respondent by his deed

of lease No. 3052 acquired the right to use the lot 2 as an access road to

lot 3 where the Petitioner was not granted any right to llse the lot 2 by his

deed No. 3053. These are admitted facts by the parties.

The dispute arose when the Petitioner commenced constructing a

retaining wall obstructing lot 2. The Respondent says that the Petitioner

3

fixed an iron gate at the entrance of lot 2 prior to the construction of the

wall, but there was no obstruction by the same. The Respondent's

grievance is that the wall constructed by the Petitioner is obstructing the

usage of the lot 2 as a roadway. The Petitioner's contention is that the lot

2 of the said plan was never used as a road and due to the soil erosion, it

was not possible to use as a road. The Petitioner further avers that lot 3 is

adjoining to the residential premises of the Respondent and he was

entering to the lot 3 through his residential premises.

The learned Magistrate, after following all the steps under chapter

Vll of the Primary Court Procedure Act, held that the Respondent is

entitle to use the lot 2 as a roadway and ordered to remove all

obstructions done by the Petitioner. Being aggrieved by the order of the

learned Magistrate, the Petitioner moved in revision in the High Court of

Kandy. The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision application

and affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate. The Petitioner appealed

against the order of the Learned High Court Judge to this Court which is

numbered CA (PHC) 12112015 and is pending before this Court. While

the appeal is pending, the Petitioner presented this revision application.

Among other reliefs, the Petitioner is seeking for an interim order to

restrain the execution of the order of the Magistrate Court.

The Petitioner, as of a right, appealed against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge. The instant application was filed while the

appeal is pending. The revision, being a discretionary remedy, has to be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances, when ~he right of appeal is

available.

It has been held in Rasheed Ali V. Mohomad Ali [1981] 1 Sri L R

262 that the Court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has

I1 f

~ t

4

gIven an aggrieved party an alternative remedy unless there are

exceptional circumstances. It has been held that;

The Court of Appeal, after an examination of numerous authorities,

has rightly taken the view that the powers of revision vested in the

Court of Appeal are very wide and the Court can in a fit case

exercise that power whether or not an appeal lies. When, however,

the law does not give a right of appeal and makes the order final,

the Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its powers of

revision, but it should do so only in exceptional circumstances.

Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by way of review,

particularly when the law has expressly given an aggrieved party

an alternate remedy such as the right to file a separate action,

except when non-interference will cause a denial of justice or

irremediable harm.

In the case ofVnik Incorporation Ltd. v. Jayasekara [1987] 2 Sri L

R 365 considered several authorities and held that;

In Perera v. Muthalib (supra)Soertsz, J. set out that the revisionary

powers of the Supreme Court are not limited to those cases in

which no appeal lies or in which no appeal has been taken for

some reason and that the Court would exercise revisionary powers

where there has been a miscarriage of justice owing to the

violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, but that this power

would be exercised only when a strong case is made out amounting

to a positive miscarriage of justice. In that case' the bond of surety

had been forfeited without an inquiry.

In the case of Attorney-General v. Podi Singho (supra) Dias, J.

held that even though the revisionary powers should not be

I

5

exercised in cases when there is an appeal and was not taken, the

revisionary powers should be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances such as (a) miscarriage of justice (b) where a strong

case for interference by the Supreme Court is made out or (c)

where the applicant was unaware of the order. Dias, J also

observed that the Supreme Court in exercising its powers of

revision is not hampered by technical rules of pleading and

procedure.

That was a case where a sentence below the minimum sentence

prescribed by law had been imposed.

Although both those cases were decided long before the present

Constitution was promulgated (incorporating Article 145) and the

amendment to section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code in 1988, the

Supreme Court expressed the view that its revisionary powers

should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred

due to afundamental rule of judicial procedure being violated, but

only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive

miscarriage of justice .....

In the case of [1990] 1 Sri L R 262 Buddhadasa Kaluarachchi V.

Nilamani Wijewickrama and Another several authorities were considered

and held at page 269 that;

It was held in Atukorale v. Samyanathan (3): "The powers given to

the Supreme Court by way of revision are wide enough to give it

the right to revise any order made by an original court whether an

appeal has been taken against it or not".

6

The trend of recent decisions is that the Court of Appeal has the

power to act in revision even though the procedure by way of

appeal is available in appropriate cases. In Rustom v. Hapangama

& Co. (4) it was held that the powers by way of revision conferred

on the appellate court are very wide and can be exercised whether

an appeal has been taken against an order of the original court or

not. However such powers would be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances where an appeal lay and as to what such

exceptionable circumstances are, is dependant on the facts of each

case. Vythialingam, J. stated in Rustom v. Hapangama & Co.

(supra) "where an order is palpably wrong and affects the rights of

a party also, this court would exercise its powers of revision to set

aside the wrong irrespective of whether an appeal was taken or

was available. "

In Sinnathangam v. Meeramohideen (5) T S. Fernando, J. said

"We do not entertain any doubt that this court possesses the power

to set aside an erroneous decision of the District Court in an

appropriate case even though an appeal against such decision has

been correctly held to have abated. It only remains for us to

examine whether there is a substantial question of law involved

here and whether this is an appropriate case for us to exercise the

powers of revision vested in this court".

In the present case the Petitioner has already exercised his legal

right of appeal. While pending the appeal, this appli~ation was filed to

obtain a stay order. The mere fact that the order of the Judge is incorrect

is not a reason to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction. It has been held in

the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohomad Ali (supra) at page 266 that;

7

It would be sufficient in the present context also to state that the

fact that a judge IS order may be merely wrong should not be a

sufficient ground for the exercise of the powers of revision in a

case such as this and, as far as I could see, the appellant could not

have placed his case any higher.

In the instant case, the Petitioner and the Respondent both are

lessees under the same lessor. Their two blocks of lands are also depicted

in the same plan as lotI and 3. Lot 2 is depicted as a roadway. This was

admitted by both parties.

The Respondent acquired the right of use of lot 2 as a roadway to

access the lot 3 from the soil owner of the lot 2. It is not a servitude

running over lot 1 which is in possession of the Petitioner as lessee. The

Petitioner has not established that he has any right to the lot 2. Unless the

Petitioner can establish prescriptive title to the lot 2, he has no right to

obstruct the Respondent from using the roadway. It is doubtful whether

the Petitioner can establish the prescriptive title to lot 2 because he has

admitted the title of the lessor. In these circumstances, the Petitioner

cannot say that the right of way acquired by the Respondent by a deed is

abundant and lot 2 is amalgamated to lot 1 and formed one land. The

Respondent's contention is that due to heavy soil erosion, lot 2 is

physically not in the ground which means that lot 2 has amalgamated to

lot 1 and formed one land.

The Petitioner submits that he obtained a development permit to

construct this wall and produced the permit. Even though the permit says

that the approved plan is attached to the permit, the approved plan was

not produced for the reasons best known to him. If the approved plan was

produced, Court would have looked in to the approved site plan of the

IIr

I!

~i,

construction site and detennined the exact point where it was approved to

construct the wall. The Petitioner being the lessee of lot 1, there is no

possibility to obtain a development pennit to construct a retaining wall

outside his land. As such, Court cannot rely on the development pennit.

The Respondent has established that he has a legal right to use the

access road through lot 2. Under section 69 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, if the dispute is on the issue of entitlement to a right to

any land, the judge has to detennine as to who is entitle that right. The

section reads;

69. (1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any

part of a land, other than the right to possession of such

land or part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall

determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the

subject of the dispute and make an order under subsection

(2).

(2) An order under this subsection may declare that any

person specified therein shall be entitled to any such right

in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as may

be specified in the order until such person is deprived of

such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent

court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference with the

exercise of such right by such party other than under the

authority of an order or decree as aforesaid

The learned Magistrate has correctly detennined that the

Respondent is entitle to the right of using lot 2 as a way of access to lot 3.

The Petitioner has not made out a strong case to revise the order of the

learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish

exceptional circumstances. I refuse the application for an interim relief

and refuse notice.

Application dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-
