The 6th and 7th suspects in Magistrate's Court of Negombo Case No.

B 1074113 were arrested and produced before the Magistrate on 15/07/2014

and 15/02/2014 respectively by officers of the Narcotics Bureau.

As the suspects have been remanded two Bail Applications were filed in

the High Court of Negombo bearing Nos. HCBA 108/2014 and HCBA

109/2014 respectively.

On the 17th of September 2014 the learned High Court Judge granted bail

to the two suspects. The said Orders granting bail have been marked as Y 1

and Z 1 and tendered along with the Petition.

On the 19th of September 2014, two days after the said bail orders were

made, the learned High Court Judge ofNegombo, cancelled the said Orders

granting bail. The said Orders were marked Y 2 and Z 2 and tendered along

with the Petition. The present bail application has been filed in view of the

aforesaid two Orders under Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

After filing objections by the Respondent the case was fixed for inquiry.

When the case was taken up for inquiry on 16/06/2015, the learned State

Counsel, on behalf of the Respondent raised a preliminary objection with

regard to the maintainability of this application. The learned State Counsel

contended, according to the oral submissions made by the learned

President's Counsel, that this application is not a Revision application nor an

Appeal. This is not an application seeking original jurisdiction of this Court

too. Hence the learned State Counsel's contention was that, according to the

law there cannot be any other application available in a bail matter.

4

It was agreed by both parties to file written submissions on the question of

the preliminary objection that related to maintainability of this application.

I will now consider the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent.

In the written submissions filed by the State Counsel in this Court it was

contended that, this application cannot be maintained as an Original or an

Appeal or Revision Application. Further it was contended, if this is an

Original Application there cannot be any other application filed in any lower

court prior to filing this application. It is relevant to note, in this matter that

the Original Applications were filed in the High Court of Negombo. Hence

the learned State Counsel's contention was that this application cannot be

considered as an Original Application, since the power has been vested in

the High Court in terms of Section 83( 1) of the Poisons and Opium and

Dangerous Drug Ordinance with regard to a person suspected or accused to

release on bail of an offence under Section 54 A or Section 54 B. The

learned State Counsel draws the attention of this Court, that according to the

jurisdiction clause in this application it only mentions Section 404 of the

Criminal Procedure Code and not any other relevant provision of Law. The

learned State Counsel further contended, hence, the jurisdiction clause is bad

in Law and this Petition cannot be maintained.

In the oral and written submissions of the learned President's Counsel

for the Petitioner, it also has been conceded that the power under Section

404, to grant bail is not an original power but an appellate power, and that a

pre-requisite of the exercise of such power, is the existence of an order of an

original court. The learned President's Counsel relied on the following

decided cases to support his case. Rev. Singarayan vs. Attorney General (2)

5

Sri Kantha Law Report 154, Nithyanathan vs. Attorney General (1983) 2

SLR 251 and Benwell vs. Attorney General (1988) 1 S.L.R. 1.

The Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as

follows:

"The amount of every bond executed under this Chapter shall be

fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not

be excessive; and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

Code or any other law, the Court of Appeal may in any case direct

that any person in custody be admitted to bailor that the bail fixed

by the High Court or Magistrate be reduced or increased, or that

any person enlarged on bail by a Judge of the High Court or

Magistrate to be remanded to custody".

The learned State Counsel for the Respondent strenuously contended

referring to the full bench decision of the Supreme Court, Attorney General

vs. Thilanga Sumathipala, that Section 404 of the Code of Civil Procedure

Act, confers only an appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Court of

Appeal and it does not vest "original" jurisdiction.

It would be necessary and relevant to consider the manner in which this

application had come before this Court. It is stated in the Petition the 6th

suspect arrested on 15/07/2014 and the i h suspect arrested on 15/02/2014 by

officers of the Narcotics Bureau and produced in Magistrate's Court,

Negombo Case No. B 1074113. The above suspects have been remanded

and two Bail Applications were filed in the High Court of Negombo. On

17/09/2014 the learned High Court Judge granted bail to the suspects. Two

days after the Bail Orders were made, on 19th September 2014, the learned

6

High Court Judge by his own motion suspended the orders granting bail.

The current bail application has been filed in view of the two orders made

by the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, it is apparent and can

identify this application as a bail refusal 1 cancel order made by the learned

High Court Judge. However, it is stated in paragraph (23) of the Petition,

"Being aggrieved by the aforesaid Orders dated 19/09/2014, marked as

'Y 2' and 'Z 2', the Petitioner begs to invoke the special jurisdiction

conferred on Your Lordship's Court by Section 404 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979".

It is relevant to note that Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, vests only appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal

and not vested any other special jurisdiction. In the judgment of Attorney

General vs. Thilanga Sumathipala it is specifically stated that the Section

404 vests only appellate and revisionary powers in the Court of Appeal.

It is significant to note in this case that there is no application to consider

those orders, in order to exercise appellate or revisionary jurisdiction, and to

set aside the orders suspending bail by the learned High Court Judge. It is

relevant to note in the Prayer of the Petition, as the relief, the Petitioner has

sought only to grant bail to the suspects and not sought to revise or set aside

the learned High Court Judge's Orders. Therefore it is relevant to note even

if this Court allows the application of the Petitioner, learned High Court

Judge's order would prevail.

In the written submissions filed in this Court by the Petitioner, it was

contended that the judgment of Rev. Singarayan vs. Attorney General was

delivered by a bench of three judges of this Court and is therefore binding

7

on this Court. It was held in that case "the power given to the Court of

Appeal by Section 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is an

appellate power and that a pre-requisite for its exercise is the existence of an

order of an original court".

I agree with the contention of the learned President's Counsel. But the

issue that has to be decided in this case is whether the Petitioner has invoked

the appellate or revisionary jurisdiction in this Court filing this Petition and

if the answer is not, would the Petitioner be entitled to maintain this case?

The power given to the Court of Appeal by Section 404 is an appellate

power and that a pre-requisite for its exercise is the existence of an order of

an original court whether it be the Magistrate's Court or the High Court

either allowing or refusing bailor fixing a sum of security which is

reviewable by the Court of Appeal.

The decisions in Rev. Singarayan Vs. Attorney General (Supra),

Nithyananda and Others vs. Attorney General (1983) 2 SLR 251 (Supra) and

Benwell vs. the Attorney General (1988) 1 SLR 1 correctly reflects the

nature of the jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by Section 404,

which is limited to appellate and revisionary jurisdiction.

Moreover, the full bench decision of the Supreme Court in Attorney

General vs. Thilanga Sumathipala, it was specifically held that Section 404

of the Criminal Procedure Code Act, vests only appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal.

Therefore it is quite clear, that the Petitioner is not entitled to beg to

invoke any other special jurisdiction.

8

In the above circumstances I am of the view, that this application is not a

revision application, nor an appeal. It is not an original application too.

Therefore, it is my considered view, that the Petitioner has not invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court in a proper manner. Hence, the Petitioner is not

entitled to proceed with this application.

For the reasons stated above I uphold the preliminary objection raised by

the learned State Counsel and dismiss this application.
