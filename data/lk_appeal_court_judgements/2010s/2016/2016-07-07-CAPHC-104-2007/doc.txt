L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an application for relisting an appeal which, has been

rejected due to nonpayment of brief fees. The Respondent Petitioner

Appellant Petitioner (hereinafter called and referred to as the Petitioner)

sates that he appealed against the order of the Learned High Court Judge

in a revision application and was awaiting for communication from this

Court to pay the brief fees; but instead of such notice, he states that he

received a notice from the Magistrate Court to appear before it to

pronounce the order of this Court. Thereafter caused to search the case

record and found that the appeal had been rejected for nonpayment of

brief fees.

The Petitioner further submits that his address in the caption of the

petition has been inadvertently entered insufficiently and the notices

issued to that address has been returned without serving. He apologizes

for his inadvertences and move this Court to relist the appeal for hearing

and he be given the opportunity to pay the brief fees.

The learned State Counsel did not file objections to this application

and at the argument also submitted that State has no objection to this

application.

This Court has issued notice to the Petitioner informing him to pay

the brief fees. The notices were sent to the address given by the Appellant

in the caption of the petition of appeal. The Appellant has submitted

documentary proof such as the electricity bill (X 6 a) the water bill (X 6

b) the Certificate on Residences issued by the Grama Niladhari (X 5) to

establish that his address is "16/ A, Aponsu Mawatha, Lakshapathiya,

Moratuwa ". The Petitioner, inadvertently entered the address as

"Lakshapathiya, Moratuwa" without mentioning the house number and

.. 3

the street name. The notice not served due to the insufficiency of the

address. It is the Petitioner himself who made the mistake of providing an

insufficient address, but the fact remains that the notice to pay the brief

fees was not served on him.

On 15.07.2003, as per order of this Court marked as X2, the Court,

with the knowledge that the notice not served, has rejected the appeal for

nonpayment of brief fees because the endorsement was that the Petitioner

was not found in the given address. The Petitioner has established the fact

that the address given in the caption is insufficient. As such, the Petitioner

had not received the notice to pay the brief fees and he was unaware that

he had been asked to pay it. He apologizes for his mistake and pleads to

relist the case for hearing. The State Counsel has no objection in restoring

the appeal for hearing.

In the case of linadasa and another v. Sam Silva and others [1994]

1 Sri L R 232 it has been held that;

The burden of alleging and proving the existence of facts, on the

basis of which a court may decide that there is good cause for

absence, rests on the absent party who seeks reinstatement. This

burden is not displaced by any presumption in his favour. A court

will hold that there was sufficient cause if the facts and

circumstances established as forming the grounds for absence are

not absurd, ridiculous, trifling or irrational but sensible, sane, and

without expecting too much, agreeable to reason. It cannot hold

that, in its judgment, there is sufficient cause to reinstate the matter

unless the grounds for coming to that conclusion were reasonable.

No distinction can be drawn between "sufficient cause" and "valid

reason".

In the case before us, the notice to pay the brief fees was not served

on the Petitioner. It has been mentioned in the journal entry dated

24.06.2013 that the notice was not served. Until the notice served from

the Magistrate Court to appear before it to pronounce the order of this

Court, he was unaware of the fact that he had been asked to pay the brief

fees.

Under these circumstances, I allow the application. I order to

reinstate the appeal. I direct the Registrar to call the record from the High

CourtlMagistrate Court and to take appropriate steps to fix the case for

hearing in the due course.

I agree.
