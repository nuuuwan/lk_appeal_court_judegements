P.R. Walgama, J

The instant application In Revision is directed against

the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

02.12.2014, by which order, the lorry, involved in the

commISSIOn of an offence under the Poisons, Opium,

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, was confiscated.

The Learned High Court J6udge has made the said

order of confiscation in terms of Section 79 of the

said Act. For the convenIence and brevity the said

Section is reproduced herein below;

2

(l)Where any person 1S convicted

against this Ordinance or any

thereunder the court shall order

of an offence

regulation made

that all or any

articles 1n respect of which the offence was

committed and any boat, vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or

rur born craft of equipment which has been used

for conveyance of such article shall, by reason of

such conviction, be forfeited to the State.

(2) Any property forfeited to the State under

subsection (1) shall,

(a) If no appeal has been preferred to the

Court of Appeal against the relevant conviction

vest absolutely 1n the State with effect from

the date on which the period prescribed for

preferring an appeal against such conviction

exp1res;

(b) If an appeal has been preferred 1n the Court

of Appeal against the relevant conviction, vest

absolutely 1n the State with effect from the

date on which such conviction 1S affirmed n

appeal.

In this subsection "relevant conviction" means the

conviction 1n consequence of which any property 1S

forfeited to the State under subsection (1).

Therefore it 1S abundantly clear that the above

Section does not glve a right to be heard in respect

of the claim to the vehicle, as there 1S no inquiry

tI

contemplated under this section when the accused

had pleaded guilty or there 1S no appeal has been

preferred against such conviction. Hence the

confiscation of the vehicle which involved 1n the

comm1SSlOn of an act prescribed 1n the Statute will

be automatic, and . . should be held before no 1nquny

the confiscating the same. It is to be noted that the

above section and the effect is different from the section

1n the Forest Ordinance which deals with the

confiscation of a vehicle involved in illegal transportation

of timber.

Section 40 of the principle enactment 1S amended by

the Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, which

reads thus;

1. Where any person 1S convicted of a forest

offence,

a. All timber or forest produce which 1S not the

property of the State 1n respect of which such

offence has been committed ; and

b. All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines

used in committing such offence.

Shall in addition to any other punishment specified for

such offence, be confiscated by order of the convicting

Magistrate:

Provided that 1n any case where the owner of such

tools, vehicles, implements and machines used 1n the

commission of such offence, is a third party, no order

of confiscation shall be made if such owner

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had

all precautions to prevent the use of such

vehicles, implements, cattle and machines as the

may be, for the commiSSIOn of the offence".

case

Therefore it IS ostensible that under the above

statue, if a third party IS the owner of the vehicle

it incumbent the Magistrate to hold . . IS on an inqUiry

before he confiscate the vehicle in issue. But it

seen from the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance. under which the offender was charged has

not been provided for such an opportunity to a third

party. Nevertheless the Learned Magistrate held an

inquiry and was not satisfied with the evidence

adduced, and as such moved to confiscate the

vehicle in issue.

Therefore the case law cited by the Petitioner are

cases which do not attract an offence under the said

Act.

Notwithstanding the said section in the act concerned

the Learned High Court Judge allowed the Petitioner

to be heard.

It IS to be noted that the accused in this case was

indicted for trafficking and posseSSIOn of 7 kilograms

564 of Cannabis Sativa in the High Court of

Monaragala in the case No. 60/14,

As the accused pleaded guilty, he was sentenced,

and an inquiry was held regarding the vehicle. At

the end of the inquiry the Learned High Court

Judge by his order dated 02.12.2014 has confiscated

the said vehicle.

Being aggrieved by the said order the petitioner has

lodged the instant application in revision to have the

said order set aside.

It IS the contention of the Respondent that the

petitioner has not established any exceptional grounds

which will compel this court to exerCIse the

revisionary powers vested in terms of the Constitution.

It is intensely relevant to note that when the above

Statue has specifically laid down conditions as to the

confiscation of the vehicle involved in the commISSIOn

of an offence stated thereof, any procedure contrary

cannot be followed where the same IS concerned.

Therefore it is the observation of this court that the

petitioner IS debarred from making this Revision

Application In order to get relief which is not allowed

by the Section 79 of the said Act.

The Learned High Court Judge has by his order

dated 13.01.2015 dismissed the appeal of the

petitioner

appeal In

on the basis that there IS no right of

terms of Section 79(1) of the above Act.

Therefore the question lies whether the petitioner has

a right to come by way of reVISIOn, to have such

order of confiscation set aside.

In the above setting this court IS of the VIew that

it is not incumbent on the courts below to hold an

inquiry or to exerCIse the revISIOnary powers to set

aside the impugned orders of the Learned Magistrate

and the Learned High Court Judge as stated above.

For the above compelling reasons the Petitioner's

application in revision is dismissed accordingly.

Application IS dismissed, subject to a cost of Rs.

10,000/-.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
