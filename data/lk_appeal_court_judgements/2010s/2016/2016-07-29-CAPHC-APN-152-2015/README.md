CASE-NO- CA I(PHC)I APN 1 152/15 ORDER- 29.07.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant order concerns an application made by

the 1 st Party - Respondents for a dismissal of the

Revision application in limine as the said application

is contrary to the Article 138 of the Constitution and

to the Section 12 of the High Court of the

Provinces Act No. 19 of 1990.

Before embarking on the said legal issue it is

considered vital to deal with the issue, as to the

reason why the 2nd Party - Respondents had to come

by way reV1SlOn to have the said impugned orders of

the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned

Magistrate to be set aside.

The officer in charge of the police Station Negombo,

filed an information in the Magistrate Court of

6

Negombo, in terms of Section 66 of the Primary

Court Act No. 44 of 1979, of a land dispute which

will affect the breach of the peace, or there IS a

likely hood of the breach of the peace due to the

said land dispute.

The said information was filed by the police, pursuant

to a complaint made by the 1st Party - Respondents, to

the effect that the 2nd Party - Party Respondents, IS

using a roadway from the land belonging to the 1 st

Party - Respondents, which IS being used for the

purpose of the boatyard.

The Learned Magistrate by her order dated 10.10.2013

had observed the fact that the 2nd Party - Respondents

has no right to use the disputed road way, over

the said land, which is being used as a boat yard,

by the 1st Party - Respondents.

Being aggrieved

Magistrate, the

In reVISIOn In

by the said order of the Learned

2nd Party - Respondents - Petitioner, moved

the High Court holden at Negombo, to

have the said impugned order set aside or vacate.

The Learned High Court Judge after analyzing the

facts therein arrived at the determination dated

19.11.2015, that there are no grounds to interfere

with the order of the Learned Magistrate, and

upheld the said order accordingly.

7

The 2nd Party - Respondents - Petitioner - Petitioner to

assailed the said order of the Learned High Court

Judge has appealed against the said order. Further

the Petitioner has also filed a reVISlOn application, for

the purpose of obtaining a stay order and stay order

was granted on 30.12.2015.

As against the Issuance of the stay order the 1 st

Party - Respondents had tendered their objection thus;

That a Revision does not lie under Section 11 (1) of

the High Court of the Province (Special Provisions)

Act No. 19 of 1990 read with Section 138 of the

Constitution In respect of an order made by the

High Court.

Section 11(1) of the said Act reads thus;

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise, subject

to the provisions of this Act or any other law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors In

fact or In law which shall

High Court established by

be committed by any

the Article 154 P of

Constitution In the exerCIse of its jurisdiction under

paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P of the

constitution and sole and exclusive cognizance by way

of appeal, revision and restitution In integrum of all

causes, suits actions, prosecutions, matters and things

of which such High Court may have taken

on

account of any error, defect, or irregularity which has

not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

It 1S apparent from the paragraph (a) of the

Statement filed by the 1ST Party - Respondents that

they totally depend on the judgment of the divisional

bench which is now pending in the Supreme Court

without a determination.

Article 154 A of the Constitution has conferred

original jurisdiction by paragraph (3) (a) or (4), the

criminal jurisdiction of the High Court AND

Any order 1n the nature of Habeas corpus, and

orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto.

Therefore it 1S abundantly clear the Court of Appeal

will exercise its appellate jurisdiction to correct all the

errors 1n fact or 1n law which shall be committed

by the High Court had exercised the original criminal

jurisdiction, as per Article 154 A (3 (a) of the

Constitution.

In essence it 1S to be noted that the above Section

11(1)

any

High

of the Court of Appeal is empowered to correct

Court only in respect of exercising the original

notice of court that the Petitioner -Appellant has
