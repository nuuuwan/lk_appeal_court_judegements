When this application came up for support yesterday 07/1112016 the Learned

President Counsel appearing for the Petitioner moved for an interim order staying

the order of the Hon. Learned High Court Judge dated 2/1112016 remanding the

Petitioner.

President Counsel Mr. Romesh de Silva submitted that the order ofthe Learned High

Court Judge dated 2/1112016 is palpably wrong and moved that an order suspending

the order to remand be made with notice to the Respondent.

He contended that the property mentioned in the indictment does not come within

the purview of Section 5(1) of the offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of

1982. He also argued that the Bail Act is a special legislation and is applicable in

this instant. Therefore there is no necessity for the Petitioner to establish exceptional

circumstances. The Reconstruction and Development Agency created by his

Excellency the President by the document marked 2R3 been a government Agency

utilizing public funds whether the property involving the indictment is public

property or not is an arguable issue. Further the proviso to Section 8 of the Public

I ,

{ f f I

Property Act contains Special Provisions for releasing a person on Bail. Therefore

whether the provision supersede the Bail Act is also in issue.

When considering the order we find that the Accused has been charged under

offences punishable under Section 113 B, 102 and 386 of the Penal Code read with

Section 5(1) of the offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982.

When considering the order of the Learned High Court Judge we are of the view that

the Learned High Court Judge has considered the property as public property and

has acted under the proviso to section 8 of the Public Property Act where the remand

is the rule and the Bail is the exception. The Learned High Court Judge has not given

any other reasons for remanding. As the personal liberty of the Accused has been

curtailed due to the order ofthe Learned High Court Judge when there is no objection

by the prosecution and who has obtained time to consider the Medical Reports and

the Supreme Court Judgment in the Fundamental Rights application as to whether it

constitutes exceptional circumstances. The Medical Report marked Xl- X5 have

been considered by the Learned High Court Judge and has come to the conclusion

that the Petitioner needs Medical treatment. The Learned High Court Judge directed

the superintendent of prisons to take prompt action if the Accused Petitioner shows

any signs of a heart disease. With all these facts, the Learned High Court Judge has

remanded the Accused-Petitioner until the prosecution consider the documents. The

arrest of the Accused-Petitioner has been prevented by the Supreme Court in the

Fundamental rights application. Even though it is not binding on the Learned High

Court Judge it should have been considered. The impugned order does not indicate

that the Learned High Court Judge has considered the Supreme Court Judgment. The

J.M.O. 's and the Cardiologist on the directions of the court have examined the

Petitioner and have reported to court that the Accused-Petitioner needs treatment

abroad in an earlier occasion.

4

F or the reasons given above we issue an interim order suspending the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 211112016 remanding the Petitioner.

We further order the Superintendent of Welikada Prison Authorities to release the

Petitioner from the remand custody and warn him to appear before the High Court

of Colombo on 10/1112016. Further we order that this order shall not be prejudicial

to any subsequent order that has to be made by the Learned High Court Judge.

We issue notice on the Respondent returnable 2211112016.
