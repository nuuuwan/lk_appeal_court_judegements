This is an appeal from the High Court of Kegalla. The O.I.C of the

Police Station Rambukkana filed information in the Magistrate Court of

Kegalla, under section 81 of the Criminal Procedure Code, informing Court

that there is a breach of the peace is likely among the parties named in the

information. The parties were directed to appear before the Magistrate Court

by the police and most of them were present before the learned Magistrate.

All parties were represented by Attorneys at Law. They appeared in Court as

three groups of persons and were represented separately by three groups of

Attorneys. All three groups of Attorneys separately informed Court that they

are willing to accept the advice of the Court to live in peace and pleaded to

release the accused on a bond. On the application of the accused, the learned

Magistrate ordered to release them on execution of a bond for keeping the

peace for a period of two years. Further, the learned Magistrate ordered that if

any of the parties executed the bond disturb the person in possession of the

land during the pendency of the civil case, to be produced before Court.

Being aggrieved by this order the petitioners moved in revision in the

Kegalla High Court and the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the

application. This appeal is there from.

The Appellants submit that the procedure adopted by the learned

Magistrate is in correct and the order is bad in law. They further submit that

the information filed by the police was not made on oath and the Appellants

were not made aware of the facts contained in it.

The Appellants are estopped from making any allegation against the

papers filed or the procedure adopted because they admitted that there was a

breach of the peace among the parties and on their own application they were

ordered to execute a bond for keeping the peace. They can only challenge the

order on the basis of an illegality. On the other hand, the operative period of

the bond has already lapsed. The order was made on 21.07.2010, and the

operative period of the bond executed for keeping the peace is two years from

that day. Under section 90(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, unless time

has been allowed for the commencement of the operative period, it

commences from the date of the order. The section reads;

90. The period for which security is required by an order made under

the preceding sections of this Chapter shall commence -

(aJ where time has not been allowed under section 89, on the

date of such order;

4

In the case before us there is no order allowing time. Therefore, the

operative period commenced from the date of the order and it has expired in

two years time. Since the operative period has lapsed; the bond has become

invalid now. As such, it is not necessary for this Court to make any order on

the bond executed for keeping the peace.

The learned Magistrate has made an order to produce before Court any

person who obstructs the person in possession of the land during the

pendency of the civil case. This part does not come to an end with the expiry

of the operative period of the bond. It is in operation until the civil case

comes to an end.

Section 81 of the Criminal Procedure Code is enacted to prevent the

breach of the peace. The section reads thus;

81. Whenever a Magistrate receives information that any person is

likely to commit a breach of the peace or ....... the Magistrate may in

manner hereinafter provided require such person to show cause why

he should not be ordered to execute a bond with or without sureties for

keeping the peace for such period not exceeding two years as the court

thinks fit to fix.

Upon the inquiry, if it is proved that it is necessary to execute a bond

for keeping the peace, under section 87 of the Code the Magistrate can order

to execute such bond.

The marginal note of the section 91 (1) reads "Contents of bond" and

the section reads thus;

91. (1) The bond to be executed by any such person shall bind him to

keep the peace or to be of good behaviour as the case may be; and in

the latter case the commission or attempt to commit or the abetment of

5

any offence punishable with imprisonment, wherever it may be

committed, is a breach of the bond.

The legislature intended only to execute a bond for keeping the peace.

Possession of a land cannot include in to a bond for keeping the peace. The

legislature has provided a separate procedure for land disputes where the

breach of the peace is likely or threatened, that is, the Part VII of the Primary

Court Procedure Act. In an inquiry under that part, the Magistrate can

determine the issue of possession or the right to possess and any violation of

such order can be punished for contempt of Court. Any order under section

81 inquiry can only contain an order to execute a bond for keeping the peace

for a period specified in that order.

Accordingly, the part of the learned Magistrate's order, that is, to

produce any person in Court who disturbs the person who is in possession of

the land, cannot stand. I order to delete that part from the order of the learned

Magistrate dated 21.07.2010.

Subject to the above variation the appeal dismissed without costs.
