JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Plaintiff Respondent was appointed as a dealer for the distribution of

"Lakcow" milk powder, for the district of Galle for a period of 01 year, as

per the agreement dated 2002-09-17 marked P 1 (b).

Under and in terms of the said agreement, the Plaintiff Respondent and the

1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents agreed inter alia,

I. that in respect of the said appointment the Plaintiff Respondent

should furnish a bank guarantee for a sum of Rs 01 million in favour

of the Manager of the Bambalapitiya branch of the 4th Defendant

Petitioner,

II. that in the event of the termination of the said agreement which can

be done by giving a notice of 30 days, 1st - 3rd Defendant

Respondents are entitled to appoint another distributor for the said

area and the said bank guarantee would be discharged .

? After furnishing the said bank guarantee the Plaintiff Respondent was

appointed as a dealer by the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents and the

7

Plaintiff Respondent functioned in that capacity. On 2003-02-05 the

Plaintiff Respondent requested 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents to

terminate the said agreement. Plaintiff Respondent further requested the

5th Defendant Respondent to discharge the said bank guarantee.

In the meantime the Plaintiff Respondent instituted case No. 2973 / Spl in

the District Court of Galle against the Respondents and obtained an

enjoining order preventing the Plaintiff Respondent claiming from the said

bank guarantee.

By order dated 2004-10-01 learned Additional District Judge of Galle

dismissed the said action of the Plaintiff Respondent holding that the court

has no jurisdiction to hear and determine that action.

In the meantime plaintiff Respondent filed the instant case in the District

Court of Colombo praying inter alia/

a) for a declaration that the bank guarantee marked P 1 (el is a bank

guarantee only in respect of monies due to the 1st - 3rd Defendant

Respondents from the Plaintiff Respondent and / or,

f\ !!1,

b) for a declaration that the said Bank guarantee is not a bank

guarantee issued in respect of the monies due to the 4th Defendant

Petitioner from the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents,

c) for a declaration that no monies are due to the 1st - 3rd Defendant

Respondents from the Plaintiff Respondent on the said bank

guarantee

d) for a declaration that Petitioner is not entitled to claim from the 5th

Defendant Respondent on the said bank guarantee any money due to

the Petitioner from 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents and / or 5th

Defendant Respondent its servants, agents and officers are not

entitled to pay the Petitioner its servants, agents and officers on the

said bank guarantee.

e) for a permanent injunction, preventing the 4th Defendant Petitioner

its servants, agents and officers recovering any money from the 5th

Defendant Respondent on the said bank guarantee,

f) for a permanent injunction, preventing the 5th Defendant Respondent

its servants, agents and officers paying any money to the Petitioner

on the said bank guarantee,

g) enjoining order/ interim injunction preventing the 5th Defendant

Respondent from paying any money to the Petitioner its servants,

agents and officers on the said bank guarantee.

The learned District Judge of Colombo by the order dated 2005-10-20

issued an interim injunction preventing the 4th Defendant Petitioner from

claiming and preventing the 5th Defendant Respondent from paying the 4th

Defendant Petitioner any money from the said bank guarantee. The said

order is marked and produced as P 6.

Thereafter the 4th Defendant Petitioner filed this application in this court

seeking leave to appeal from the said order dated 2005-10-20 of the

learned District Judge of Colombo.

This court on 2006-07-27 has granted leave to appeal to the 4th Defendant

Petitioner on the following questions:

I. has the learned District Judge misdirected himself with regard to the

terms and conditions and the purpose of the bank guarantee marked

P 1 Cel and annexed to the Petition

II. in all circumstances of this case did learned District Judge err in law

in issuing interim injunction preventing the 4th Defendant Petitioner

10

claiming from the 5th Defendant Respondent and / or preventing the

5th Defendant Respondent in making payment to the 4th Defendant

Petitioner under the said bank guarantee marked P 1 (c).

III. has learned District Judge erred in law and in fact by holding that in

the event an interim injunction is issued no loss will be caused to the

4th Defendant Petitionerl.

Therefore the task before this court at this moment is to find answers to

the above 3 questions.

Letter of guarantee dated 2003-01-13 issued by the 5th Defendant

Respondent (Seylan Bank) addressed to the Manager, Pan Asia Bank

Bambalapitiya Branch (4th Defendant Petitioner) is marked and produced as

P 1 (c) .

According to the said letter of guarantee,

I. 1 st - 3rd Defendant Respondents (who carry on a business in

partnership) have requested from 4th Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia

Bank) for credit facilities amounting to Rs 1 million for the distribution

1 Journal entry dated 2006-07-27 of the docket maintained in this Court pertaining to this case.

..

11

of "Lakcow" milk powder to Galle Multipurpose Co-operative Societies

Limited (Plaintiff Respondent).

II. The 4th Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank) has agreed to grant the

said facilities on condition that 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents

furnish a bank guarantee from a reputed bank to the value of Rs 01

million in favour of the Manager Pan Asia Bank, Bambalapitiya branch

Colombo 04, for the purpose of distribution and sale of "Lakcow" milk

powder.

III. the 5th Defendant Respondent (Seylan Bank) has guaranteed and

undertaken to pay the 4th Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank) a

sum not exceeding Rs. 01 million in the event the Plaintiff

Respondents fails or neglects to pay the said-sum of money on the

due date under a credit agreement between the 4th Defendant

Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank) and the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents

IV. that this guarantee would be in force from 2003-01-13 to 2004-01-12

Learned District Judge of Colombo in his Order dated 2005-10-20 has held

a) that the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents had agreed to discharge

the bank guarantee on payment of Rs 244,440.00 by the Plaintiff

Respondent as the total payment due

12

b) that there is no money due to the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents

from the Plaintiff Respondent,

c) that the said bank guarantee was continued to be retained as a

security for the credit facilities obtained by 1st - 3rd Defendant

Respondents,

d) that the Plaintiff Respondent has no connection in the said credit

facilities obtained by the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents and hence

the Plaintiff respondent is not responsible for the said credit facilities

e) that the action filed in the District Court of Galle in this regard under

No. 2973 / Spl has been dismissed and the appeal lodged there to

has also been withdrawn

f) that the 4th Defendant Respondent bank is not entitled to retain the

bank guarantee as a security for the credit facilities obtained by the

1 st - 3rd Defendant Respondents as there is no payment due from the

Plaintiff Respondent

g) that in these circumstances the Plaintiff Respondent is entitled prima

facie to get the bank guarantee discharged.

"

13

Some of the clauses relevant to the bank guarantee [P 1 (C)] referred to

in the agreement [P 1 (b)] between 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents and

the Plaintiff Respondent are reproduced below.

Clause 2: "The distributor shall be appointed as the sole distributor to sell

and distribute the said merchandise in Sri Lanka in an area specified in

writing by the Marketing Manager which is explained in the annexed

schedule. "

Clause 3: "For the aforesaid purpose the distributor shall have a bank

guarantee of Rs 1 million only for the purpose of distribution and sale of

"Lakcow" milk powder in favour of the Manager Pan Asia Bank,

Bambalapitiya branch Colombo 04."

Clause 11: "If the distributor furnishes a bank guarantee of Rs one Million

the supplier shall at the cost and expense of the supplier make available a

sales representative for the purpose of distribution and marketing the

merchandise. "

Clause 12: "At time of collecting the merchandise the distributor shall

issue a cheque of the person giving the bank guarantee for the entire value

of the merchandise so collected in favour of the supplier."

I I I '-

i } I I I t I I I I I

14

Clause 18: "If the distributor wishes to terminate this agreement before

the expiry of the agreed period shall give notice in writing and 30 days

thereafter the supplier shall appoint another distributor that area and

release the bank guarantee of the distributor."

Clause 19: "This agreement shall be valid and in force for 1 year from the

date of signing."

The condition that has been agreed upon between the 4th Defendant

Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank) and the 5th Defendant Respondent (Seylan

bank) is for the 5th Defendant Respondent to guarantee and undertake to

pay the Petitioner a sum not exceeding Rs 1 million in the event the 1st -

3rd Defendant Respondents fail or neglect to pay the said sum of money on

the due date under a credit agreement between the 4th Defendant

Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank) and the 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents for the

purpose of distribution and sale of "Lakcow" milk powder in a specified

area.

The purpose as to why this credit facility was granted by the 4th Defendant

Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank), is mentioned in the Letter of Guarantee as "for

the distribution of "Lakcow" milk powder to Galle Multi Purpose

ti !I !

t

15

Co-operative Society Ltd. of No. 67, W D S Abeygunawardane

Mawatha, Pettigala watta, Galle."

Therefore the liability of the 5th Defendant Respondent (Seylan Bank) to

pay the guaranteed amount arises "in the event the principle fails or

neglects to pay the said sum of money on the due date under a credit

agreement between the beneficiary and the principle." "Principle" here

means 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents. "Beneficiary" in this agreement

means the 4th Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank). The credit agreement

referred to in the above phrase means the credit facility granted by the

4h Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank), for the purpose of distribution of

"Lakcow" milk powder to Galle Multi Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd.

The said Letter of Guarantee revolves around four parties. They are 4th

Defendant Petitioner (Pan Asia Bank), 5th Defendant Respondent (Seylan

Bank), 1st - 3rd Defendant Respondents, Galle Multi Purpose Co-operative

Society Ltd (Plaintiff Respondent).

In the case of Indica Traders ePvt) Ltd v Seoul Lanka Constructions ePvt)

Ltd. and others, S N Silva J President Court of Appeal as he then was, has

stated as follows:

"It is thus clear that business transactions between a bank and a

beneficiary, constituted in the nature of a performance bond, a

performance guarantee, letter of guarantee or a irrevocable letter of credit,

whereby the bank is obliged to pay money to a beneficiary, are not

tripartite transactions between the bank (surety), the beneficiary (creditor)

and the party at whose instance the bond, guarantee or letter is issued

(the principal debtor) but, simply transactions between the bank and the

beneficiary. A bank thereby guarantees to the beneficiary payment of

money and is obliged to honour that guarantee according to its terms. Any

dispute that may arise between the beneficiary creditor) and the party at

whose instance the guarantee or letter is given (the principal debtor), on

the underlying contract cannot be urged to restrain the bank from

honouring the guarantee or letter according to its terms, In an application

for an injunction to restrain the bank from making payment, the Court has

to consider whether there is a challenge to the validity of the bond,

guarantee or letter itself, upon which payment is claimed and whether the

conditions as specified in the writing are satisfied. If the challenge to the

validity is not substantial and the conditions as specified in the writing are

-0

17

metl prima facie no injunction should be granted and the bank should be

left free to honour its obligation.

The only exception to this general rule is where it is established by the

party applying for the injunction that a claim for payment upon such bond,

guarantee or letter is clearly fraudulent. A mere plea of fraud put in for the

purpose of bringing the case within this exception and which rest on the

uncorroborated statement of the applicant will not suffice. An injunction

may be granted only in circumstances where the Court is satisfied that the

bank should not affect payment. Therefore l an injunction may be granted

on the ground of fraud only where there is clear evidence as to:

(i) the fact of fraud and,

(ii) the knowledge of the bank as to the facts constituting the fraud. ,,2

It must be remembered that in that case this Court has taken in to

consideration the fact that there is payment due from the Plaintiff in that

case3

This has been followed in the subsequent case of Hemas Marketing

ePvt) Ltd. V. Chandrasiri and others4 in which case also this Court had

taken in to consideration the fact that a sum, far in excess of the bank

guarantees was due to Hemas Marketing (Pvt) Ltd 5 .

As per the above judgment in Indica Traders epVT) LTD v Seoul Lanka

Constructions ePvt) Ltd. and others6, In an application for an injunction to

restrain the bank from making payment, the following questions namely,

I. whether there is a challenge to the validity of the bond, guarantee or

letter itself, and

II. whether the conditions as specified in the writing are satisfied.

must be considered by Courts. Further, the Court should issue no

injunction and the bank should be left free to honour its obligation, only if

the challenge to the validity is not substantial and the conditions as

specified in the writing are met, prima facie.

It is the view of this Court that in the instant case, there exists serious

challenges,

6 (Supra)

, I

!

19

I. to the validity of the Letter of Guarantee in particular, the purpose it

is sought to be used, and

II. whether the conditions as specified in the Letter of Guarantee are

satisfied.

Two of the judgments pronounced by this Court namely, Pan Asia Bank Ltd

Vs. Bentota MPCS Ltd and another? which was decided by this Court in the

year 2005 and Pan Asia Bank Ltd Vs. Kandy Multipurpose Co-operative

Society and others8 which was decided by this Court in the year 2007, need

to be mentioned here as they have been brought to our notice. In both

these cases, the facts

I. that each of the respective Co-operative was not indebted to their

supplier

II. that the purpose of the bank guarantee is for the appointment as a

distributor of "Lakcow" milk powder

were not disputed.

Hence a question arises as to why each of those Co-operatives should still

pay a further sum of money to their respective suppliers and as to how and

7 (2012) 1 SLR 50

8 (2012) 1 SLR 78

20

on what basis could each of those Co-operatives be made liable to pay

such additional sum. The position taken up by the 1st - 3rd Defendant

Respondents is that the bank guarantee was kept as a security for the

credit facility provided to them by the 4th Defendant Petitioner. If that is

the case this Court is unable to find any acceptable answer to the question

as to why a Co-operative would want to keep a bank guarantee from their

bank to secure a transaction which it has no connection taking the full risk

of it's encashment. Further, such a move on the part of the 1st - 3rd

Defendant Respondents if they had done so, would be a clear indication of

a possible fraud also. Indeed it was the position of the Plaintiff Respondent

that there exists such a fraud.9 This aspect of the case appear to have not

been considered in the above two judgments and that prompts us to desist

ourselves from following those two judgments.

As shown before, a distinguishable feature in the cases of Indica Traders

ePvt) Ltd Vs. Seoul Lanka Constructions ePvt) Ltd. and others10 and Hemas

9 Paragraph 16 of the affidavit dated 2004-10-21 filed in DC on behalf of the Plaintiff Respondent marked P 2.

10 (Supra)

1 I. I ~ l 1 ! I ! i i I

1 i , ,

21

Marketing ePvt) Ltd. Vs. Chandrasiri and othersll is the existence of the

undisputed fact that the money is due to the benefiCiary.

In these circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, this Court answers,

1) the 1st issue for which leave to appeal was granted by this Court,

holding that the learned District Judge has not misdirected himself

with regard to the terms and conditions and the purpose of the bank

guarantee marked P 1 (el and annexed to the Petition.

2) the 2nd issue for which this Court has granted leave to appeal,

holding that in all the circumstances of this case the learned District

Judge did not err in law in issuing the interim injunction preventing

the 4th Defendant Petitioner claiming from the 5th Defendant

Respondent and / or preventing the 5th Defendant Respondent in

making payment to the 4th Defendant Petitioner under the said bank

guarantee marked P 1 (e).

In view of the answer provided by this Court to the question No. (ii) above

answering the issue No. (iii) would not arise. That is because this Court has

taken the view that it is justifiable in all the circumstances of this case for

the learned District Judge to have an interim injunction issued.

11 (Supra)

! ! ,

22

For the reasons set out above, we direct that this appeal be dismissed with

costs.

We further direct that the learned District Judge of Colombo should be free

to decide on the issues pertaining to this case after considering the

evidence that would be adduced in the trial pending before him. The

conclusions arrived at by this Court in this judgment should be treated as

those necessitated for the purpose of disposal of this appeal which is

restricted only to the question of issuance of interim injunction.
