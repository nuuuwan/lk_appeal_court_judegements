The plaintiff-Respondent (the Plaintiff) instituted a partition

action for the partition of the land called KETAKELAGAHAWATTA".

The case was taken up for trial on 8 issues and first issue was

settled between the Plaintiff and 2nd Defendant during the course of

the trial. The learned District Judge has delivered his judgment on

1999/08/24 in favour of the plaintiff respondent. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment the defendant appellant preferred this appeal.

There are three mrun disputes should be analyzed in this

case. They are:

i) Whether the appeal is time barred according to the

preliminary application.

ii) Whether the Learned District Judge failed to identify

corpus.

iii) Whether the learned District Judge erred in holding

that the appellant has not proved prescriptive title to

the corpus. I !it! t I

i.Appeal is time barred.

According to the Section 755 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code "Every

appellant shall within sixty days from the date of the judgment or

decree appealed against present to the original Court, a petition of

appeal setting out of the circumstances out of which the appeal

arises and the grounds of objection to the judgment of decree

appealed against the containing the particulars required by Section

758 which shall be signed by the appellant or his Registered -

Attorney. Such petition of appeal shall be except from stamp duty.

Provided that if such petition is not presented to the original court

within sixty days from the date of the judgment or decree appealed

against the court shall refuse to receive the appeal". In this matter

the specific date the impugned judgment was delivered is not stated

on the face judgment but it was delivered in open court on

24/08/ 1999 according to the journal entry.

computing time limits for filing the notice of appeal and petition of

appeal only the date on which the judgment was pronounced can

be excluded". Therefore here appellant should filed his petition of

appeal on or before 23/10/2016 excluding judgment day. Since

the present petition of appeal had been filed on 25/10/1999 on its

62nd day contended that it had been filed out of time. But 60th and

61 st days happened to be Saturday and Sunday which are no

working days.

Computation of time.

(1) Where a limit time from any date or from the happening of

any event is appointed or allowed by any written law for the doing

of any act or the taking of any proceeding in a court or office, and

the last day of the limited time is a day on which the court or office

is closed, then the act or proceeding shall be considered as done or

taken in due time if it is done or taken on the next day thereafter

on which the court or office is open.

(2) where by any written law any act or proceeding is

directed or allowed to be done or taken in a court or office on a

certain day, then if the court or office is closed on that day the act

or proceeding shall be considered as done or taken in due time if it

6

is done or taken on the next day thereafter on which the court or

office is open.

The question that is involved in this appeal is whether

saturdays should be excluded or included in computing the

fourteen days prescribed by Section 756(4) of the Civil Procedure

Code for the application for Leave to Appeal to be presented to the

Court of Appeal. This sub-section provides that "the application for

Leave to Appeal shall be presented to Supreme Court for his

purpose by the party appellant or his Registered Attorney within a

period of fourteen days from the date when the order appealed

against was pronounced exclusive of the date of that date itself and

of the day when the application is presented and of Sundays and

public holidays". Article 169 (2) of the Constitution provides that

every reference in any existing written law to the Supreme Court

shall be deemed to be a reference to the Court of Appeal. Counsel

for the appellant conceded that if saturdays are not excluded, the

preliminary objection raised by Counsel for respondent, that the

t

II!

7

application has been filed out of time should succeed. The Court of

Appeal has upheld the objection and hence this appeal by the

appellant has upheld the objection and hence this appeal by the

appellant.

The appellant citing the judgment In Jinadasa Vs.

Hemamali and others 2006 2 SLR Pg.300. "the law cannot

expect the performance of what is impossible and when the law had

given a party a limited time to be perform a certain cat he should

be given the full benefit of that period as in this case where it was

not possible for the party having a period of Sixty days to file the

petition of appeal on the 60th day as the 60th and 61 st days

happened to be Saturday and Sunday.

Therefore I am of the view that the petition of Appeal filed on

next working day was within the period as provided for in Section

755 (3). In this circumstance, petition of the appeal of the appellant

is within time and the preliminary objection raised by the

respondent is rejected without costs.

ii) Identification of the Corpus

In a partition action there is a duty cast on the District Judge

to ascertain the identity of the corpus sought to be partitioned and

to investigate the title of each party before allotting shares,

irrespective of what the parties mayor may not.

The boundaries of the corpus identified by the Surveyor

K.D.L.Wijenayake in Preliminary Plan No.871 dated 11/07/1997

and the boundaries of the land sought to be partitioned by the

plaintiff according to the schedule to the plaint are as same. But

the issue arose in the extent of the corpus should be partitioned.

According to the plaint of the corpus has an extent of 1 Acre and 1

Rood when the surveyor goes to identify the property to portioned

and draw up the preliminary plan found out that the property to be

partitioned is only 1 Rood and 1.8 Perches.

However , defendant had right to challenged the extent

during the trial but no parties challenged and accepted the

Preliminary Plan No.871 dated 11/07/1997 made by the Surveyor

K.D.I. Wijenayake in their admission record dated in 1998/07/13 .

Therefore the learned District Jude clearly find out the corpus is to

be partitioned.

The learned District Judge erred in holding that the appellant

has not proved prescriptive title on the corpus.

Counsel for the appellant stated that the appellant have

clearly proved their prescriptive title allegedly acquired by their

ultimate predecessors in title and the learned District Judge has

erred in holding that the appellants have not proved prescriptive

title to the corpus and have proved the title of Georgie Silva, how

he is entitled to 1/8 share. He further stated that learned District

Judge failed further stated that the Learned District Judge failed to

consider the analyze the aforementioned facts and the legal position

clearly established by the defendant appellant.

The Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent stated that

the learned District Judge had come to a correct finding

considering the evidence led before him and also considering the

documents marked and that the appeal should be dismissed with

costs.

The 3rd Defendant - Appellant failed to produce or explain

how Geogie Silva was entitled to 1/8 share except for the fact that

it is stated in the statement of claim of the 3rd Defendant-Appellant

that to be prescriptive possession. Hingappu and Georgie Silva

became entitle to 1/4 share. And also 3rd Defendant -Appellant came

the possession in a part of the corpus, that the admitted fact that

Baby Nona who is 3rd Defendant- Appellant Grandmother (1 st

Defendant ) had been inoccupation of a portion of the land for long

time. And Baby Nona and 4th Defendant (father of the 3rd

Defendant transferred their rights to 2nd Defendant-Respondent. In

these circumstance 3rd Defendant -Appellant failed to prove his

prescriptive title allegedly acquired by his ultimate predecessors.

Further the appellant build and came into occupation of the

house "B" in 1998 or 1989 as stated and document "3V 1" executed

In 1988/04/01 by him still he could not have claim on

presxcriptive possession either.

In the case of MithrapaZa and Others Vs. lkonis Singho

(2005) 1 SLR 2061. held that where the party invokes the provisions

of Section 3 of the prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the

ownership of the adverse claimant to immovable property the

burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a

starting point for his or acquisition of prescriptive title.

In this circumstances, for the reasons of the aforesaid, appeal

is dismissed without costs.
