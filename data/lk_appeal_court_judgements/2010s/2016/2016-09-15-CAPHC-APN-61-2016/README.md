CASE -NO- CA-PHC-(APN)- 61/ 2016- ORDER- 15.09.2016

P.R. WALGAMA J,

The Officer in Charge of Kadugannawa Police instituted

action In the Magistrate Court of Kandy on a

complaint received from the public of a nUIsance

caused to them by the operation of the factory of

manufacturing quartz grits.

The said application was filed In terms of Section 98

(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code No 15 of 1979.

Further a complaint was also made regarding the

validity of the permit to carry on the business. It is

alleged by the complainant that the Respondent

6

company IS carryIng on this business without a valid

permit for the year 2016.

Pursuant to the said application by the Police the

Learned Magistrate issued summons to the

Respondents. It IS seen from the record that after

receIvIng summons the 2nd Respondent made his

appearance in court and after recording evidence from

the complainants the Learned Magistrate made order

on 14.03.2016, staying the operation of the alleged

factory. But nevertheless by order dated 18.03.2016 the

court allowed the Respondents to remove the bags

containing the said grits.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Responden t-

Petitioners moved the High Court in Revision to have

the said order set aside. The Respondent- Petitioners In

their petition to the Provincial High Court has

basically reiterated the facts stated above and had

specifically averred that the Respondent Company had

applied for the permit to the Environment Protection

Bureau, and it is in the process of issuing the same.

It IS contended by the Petitioners that the

Magistrate made the said impugned order on

that the Petitioners were carryIng on the

without a valid permit. Further it IS alleged

Learned

the basis

business

that the

Learned Magistrate has made an order to close down

the factory, without making a conditional order.

7

The Petitioners had assailed the said order of the

Learned Magistrate for the reasons stated below;

a. That

InquIre

the Magistrate IS not empowered to

in to the fact, whether the Company has

permit or not, In making an order

under Section 98(b) of the Criminal Procedure

Code No. 15 of 1979.

b. That the said order IS contrary to Section 98

of the Criminal Procedure Code,

. c. That In terms of Section 98 of the Criminal

Procedure Code the Magistrate IS empowered

only to make a conditional order, and therefore

to make an order to close down the factory at

the very first instant IS contrary to the law

and 0 bnoxious to the above section.

The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

28.04.2016 has refused the application to stay the

order of the Learned Magistrate, without stating any

reason for making such order.

Being dissatisfied with the said impugned order the

Respondent- Petitioners, came by way of Revision to

have the said orders of the Learned High Court Judge

and the Learned Magistrate vacated.

The said order of the Learned Magistrate IS basically

impugned on the ground that it is not a conditional

order as contemplated In the Section 98 (1) of the

Criminal Procedure Code. Further it seen from the said

8

order that no time limit has been fIxed for the said

order.

Therefore it IS contended by the Petitioners that said

order IS a violation of the above section and should

be set aside forthwith.

The Counsel for the Petitioners In sUbmitting the

written submissions to court has adverted to the

above section which gives the Magistrate only to make

a conditional order for a limited period. But In the

instant matter the Learned Magistrate by his order

had made a permanent order for a closure of the

factory and there by had violated the Section 98(1)(b)

of the Criminal Procedure Code.

I t IS asserted by the Counsel for the Petitioners that

the Learned Magistrate is not empowered to make any

order regarding the posseSSIon of a valid permit, under

Section 98 (l)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. But

should . . InqUIre In to the public nUIsance complained

by the complainants.

Therefore the core Issue for the Magistrate to consider

was whether the business that was carryIng on by

the Respondent- Petitioners is InJunous to the health or

physical comfort of the community.

It IS contended by the Counsel for the Complainant-

Respondent that the Learned Magistrate In making the

said order had also taken In to account the evidence

9

adduced by the complainants and made the order and

had g1ven the opportunity for the Respondent-

Petitioners to make any application for any variation

of the stay order issued by the Learned Magistrate. It

1S seen from the case record that on the day the

said impugned order was made the 2nd Respondent-

parties.
