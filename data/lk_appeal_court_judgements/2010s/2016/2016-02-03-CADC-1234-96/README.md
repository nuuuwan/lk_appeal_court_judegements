Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Horana on

12.06.1989 to partition the land called /lindigahadeniya Kumbura which is

morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint. The said land is depicted as

the corpus in Plan No. 468 dated 31st March, 1st April 1990 made by N.R.E.J Silva,

Licensed Surveyor, marked as /IX".

3

Originally the Plaintiff has allotted the land among herself and 1_10th

Defendants and the other Defendants have intervened in the case

subsequently. It appears that on 27.07.1998 when the trial commenced it is

recorded that there is no contest amongst the parties as to the identity of the

corpus. Parties have raised points of contest and thereafter the Plaintiff has

given evidence.

Plaintiff has closed her case by producing Deeds Pl to P17 and the Plan

"X" and its Report "Xl" . Thereafter the 4th Defendant has given evidence. The

Judgment has been entered on 24.09.1996 according to which, the 4th

Defendant has been allotted 63/7560 shares of the corpus. Being aggrieved by

this Judgment the 4th Defendant has preferred this appeal to this Court. The

only question that is raised in the appeal by the 4th Defendant is that an extent

of 10 perches which he got by Deed of Transfer No. 6182 dated 16.12.1988 and

marked as 402 in his evidence, has not been allotted to him in the Judgment.

The reason given by the learned District Judge for not allotting this 10 perches

to the 4th Defendant was that the said Deed No. 6182 dated 16.12.1988{4D2)

had been executed subsequent to the institution of this case and the said deed

No. 6182 had not been tendered to court and therefore cannot be allotted. This

finding of the learned District Judge is wrong. It is manifestly clear that the Deed

4

No.6182 which has been executed on 16.12.1988 and this action was instituted

on 12.06.1989. Thus the Deed is not executed subsequent to the institution of

the action but long before. Furthermore, when the 4th Defendant had given

evidence this Deed (4D2) had been spoken about (see overleaf of page 121 of

the appeal brief) and subsequently by a motion, this deed and three other

deeds had been tendered to court on 16.07. 1996. The motion id date stamped

on 17.07.1996. The learned District Judge has also referred to this deed in his

judgment ( see page 12 of the judgment)

It is surprising that how a document is given a marking as 4D2 without it

being tendered to court and without receiving the attention of the Judge. This

deed 4D2 which gives rights to 10 perches of the corpus to the 4th Defendant has

been tendered to court and I therefore hold that the Deed No.6182 marked as

4D2 must be accepted as a document by which the 4th Defendant became

entitled to 10 perches and this 10 perches should be added to the 63/7560

shares already allotted to the 4th Defendant by the judgment entered in this

case. The notable point in this regard is that the parties to this case has also

admitted that an extent of 10 perches was transferred to the 4th Defendant by

the 20th and 22nd Defendants by the said Deed No. 6182 ( see page 109 of the

appeal brief). The learned District Judge is hereby directed to amend the

5

judgment to include 10 perches of the corpus to the shares already allotted to

the 4th Defendant. The 10 perches need not be reverted back to the 20th and

22nd Defendants who are the transferees in Deed No. 6182{4D2}.

Similarly the 9A Defendant has also submitted to this court that certain

shares to which he is entitled have not been allotted to him. In the written

submissions filed by the Counsel it is stated that -

i} Disohamy's right to 1/36 shares had been transferred to him by

Deed marked 9V5 but the learned District Judge has left this share

una"otted on the ground that that the Deed 9V5 was not tendered

to court;

ii} Rights of Misilawathie to an undivided 67/2520 shares are

una"otted to anyone as no evidence was led in respect of those

rights;

iii} Since the 20th Defendant had transferred 40 perches to the Plaintiff,

this 40 perches should be reduced from the shares of the 20th

Defendant, but the learned District Judge has failed to do so in his

judgment;

6

The 9A Defendant submits that the unallotted shares (1/36 share)

of Disohamy and the 67/2520 shares of Misilawathie must be allotted to

him.

It is submitted in the written submission filed on behalf of the 9A

Defendant that the 1/36 share of Disohamy was not allotted to him

because the learned District Judge has stated in his judgment that the

Deed 9V5 relating to that share was not tendered to court. But the said

deed had been on 29.03.1996, tendered as per Journal entry No. 43. As

the Deed 9V5 has been now available, the share 1/36 of Disohamy, which

she transferred by 9V5 can be allotted to 9A Defendant.

Regarding the undivided 67/2520 shares of Misilinona, the counsel

for the 9A Defendant says, in his written submissions that this shares was

not allotted to 9A Defendant because the learned District Judge was of

the view that no evidence was led in this regard. But on 27.07.1995 the

Plaintiff in her evidence has stated that Misilawathie by Deed P10 had

transferred her share to the 9th Defendant (see pages 115 and 116 of the

appeal brief), and therefore he submits that this 67/2520 share can be

allotted to 9A Defendant.

7

I find that the reasons given by the counsel for 9A Defendant for

the allotment of the shares of Disohamy and Misilawathie to 9A Defendant are

sound and can be accepted, and I hold that these two shares may be allotted

to 9A Defendant, as per evidence led in the case.

The counsel for the 9A Defendant has also submitted in his written

submissions that he Plaintiff and the 20th defendant admitted in their evidence

that the 20th Defendant by Deed marked P17 had transferred 40 perches out

of his entitlement to the Plaintiff, but this 40 perches has not been reduced

from 20th Defendant's as allotted in the judgment. He draws the attention of

this court to proceedings of 27.07.1995 appears in page 119 and page 125 of

the appeal brief. As the evidence of the plaintiff and the 20th Defendant

clearly support the position stated by the 9A Defendant's counsel, the said 40

perches may be reduced from the shares allotted to the 20th Defendant.

Accordingly I hold that the judgment entered in this case may

be amended and the parties may be allotted their respective shares in

terms of the amended judgment. Since the other parties have made no

8

objection to the said amendments, I am of the view that the said

amendments will not cause any prejudice to the rights of other parties.

I allow the appeal and send the record back to the District Court to

enable the learned Judge to make the amendments suggested above, and

after the amendments commission may be issued to effect the final

Partition.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
