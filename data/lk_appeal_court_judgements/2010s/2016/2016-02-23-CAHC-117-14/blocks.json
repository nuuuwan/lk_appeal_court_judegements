However even at that stage the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant had not stated the fact that the indictment had not been read to his client, this shows that in fact the indictment had been read to his client. Furthermore, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that, nowhere in the petition of appeal does it say that the indictment was not read to the accused. He further stated that when there were so many opportunities for the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant to inform Court that the indictment had not been read to his client, none of the opportunities had been availed of by the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant. Therefore one cannot come to the conclusion that the indictment had not been read to the Accused.",

The Bribery Commissioner 1992 (1) SLR76 is entirely different from the present case because in the aforementioned case the Learned Magistrate had proceeded to trial without framing a charge against the accused. However, in this case the situation is entirely different because the indictment was handed over to the Appellant before the trial commenced. The trial commenced six years after service of the indictment to the Appellant. Thus, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the Appellant had six years to read the indictment and get ready for the trial. He further stated that the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant at the trial court had never complained that the indictment was not read to his client. Therefore this shows that the Learned High Court Judge had in fact read the indictment but failed to record the same. He further stated that merely because the plea of not guilty is not recorded in the Court record, an order given by a competent Jurisdiction should not be reversed.",

However, an omission to read over and explain the charge will not vitiate the trial, if no prejudice is thereby caused to the accused.

Perera have held thus \" ......... the provisions with regard to the procedure that has to be adopted in the High Court are very much similar and the words and the sections are almost in verbatim. If these requirements are held imperative in Magistrate's Court it should be more so when an accused is arraigned in a High Court for much graver offences. The judges must be concerned about the rule of law and the principals of a fair trial, protection of their interest should be at the forefront of their minds\".",
