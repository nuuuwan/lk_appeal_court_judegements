CASE - NO - 65/1998 - (F) - JUDGMENT - 29.02.2016

P.R.Walgama, J

The instant appeal concerns an application made by the

1 st and 7th Defendants - Appellants - Petitioners to have this

appeal relisted as the same has been abetted on

17.06.2014, on the basis of the absence of the Appellants.

The above Appellants lodged the instant appeal seeking to set

aside the judgment entered by the Learned District Judge of

Kalutara dated 02.12.1997, in the Partition case bearing No.

4746/1987.

The Learned District Judge has rejected the Plaintiffs

pedigree and had accepted the

7th Defendants, and held that

pedigree

lot No3

of the 1st and

and the house

standing thereon is a separate land and same had

been allotted to the 15th Defendant - Respondent.

In this instant appeal the only contestant party is the 15th

Defendant - Respondent.

It was the position of

Lots 3,4, and 7 shown

the 1st Defendant Appellant

in the preliminary plan do

that

not

form part of the corpus and the said lots had been

possessed by the 15th Defendant - Respondent and thereby

gain prescriptive title to the said lots.

It is the contention of the 15th Defendant -Respondent that

the disputed portion to vit. the lot 3 was not a part of

7

l

tI

the corpus and the said portion has been transferred by

the 7th Defendant -Appellant.

The stance of the 15th Respondent is that the lot 3,

in the Preliminary plan has been registered in a

different folio as a different land. Therefore it is asserted

by the 15th Defendant -Respondent that he holds title

to the said lot 3 by virtue of Deed No. 4040.

The 1st and the 7th Defendant- Appellants appp~lprl ;:)<lin<;;t the

said judgment to the Court of Appeal on 16.01.1098, and the

Court of Appeal by the Judgment dated 15.10.2012 had

dismissed the Appeal. The 1st and the 7th Appellants, appealed

against the said judgment to the Supreme Court, and it was

at that stage it brought to the notice of Court at the time of

the judgment was pronounced in the Court of Appeal the

Plaintiff was dead.

As the Plaintiff was dead at the time of Court of Appeal

delivered the Judgment, the Supreme Court held that the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal is invalid and ordered to

rehear after necessary substitution is done.

Pursuant to the afore said this Court has issued notices

on all parties, returnable on 17.06.2014. The journal of the

said date indicates that the 1st and 7th Defendant - Appellants

were absent and unrepresented,

abated this appeal.

and only 15th Defendant -

His Lordship of this

tfIIf It!

The Petitioners thereafter filed a motion dated 27.06.2014

and moved court to support the same. When the

above motion was supported this Court ordered the

Appellants to issue notices on all parties, But nevertheless

it is seen from the journal entries that no steps

had been taken by the Appellants to substitute the

deceased Plaintiff, as directed by the Supreme Court.

Therefore without complying the order of the Supreme

Court this Court cannot proceed further. Hence the

application of the Appellants to relist this appeal should

stand dismissed.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed without costs.
