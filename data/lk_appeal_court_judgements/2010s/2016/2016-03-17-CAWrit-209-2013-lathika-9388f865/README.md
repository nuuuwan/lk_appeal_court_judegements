Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application lathika Sevaka Sangamaya a Trade Union registered under the

Trade Unions Ordinance No. 14 of 1935 (as amended) has come before this court seeking inter alia,

b) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision dated

17.08.2011 and 15.10.2012 marked F and G respectively of the 2nd to 51h Respondents not

to issue a direction to the lSI Respondent to provide check off facility to the Petition and

not to refer the dispute relating to the said check off for arbitration

c) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd to 51h

Respondents to issue a direction to the lSI Respondent to provide check off facility to the

Petitioner as requested by the letter marked A and

Alternatively

d) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd to 51h

Respondents to refer the dispute between the Petitioner and the lSI Respondent for

arbitration.

Petitioner had taken up the position before this court that it has a branch union in the lSI Respondent

Company with more than 230 subscribing members, whose check off are deducted from their salaries.

As alleged by the Petitioner the dispute between the Petitioner and the lSI Respondent was commenced

due to a refusal by the lSI Respondent to check off with regard to 27 employees who has obtained

membership of the Petitioner union recently. On a complaint made by the petitioner, an inquiry was

held by the officers of the Labour Department and the decision of the said inquiry was communicated

to the petitioner's by document produced marked G.

4

Being dissatisfied with the said decision communicated to the Petitioner by documents marked F and

G Petitioner has come before this court seeking relief as referred to above.

The present application is filed before this court in July 2013 and supported for notices on 09th

September 2013. Out of the two documents the Petitioner sought to quash, document marked F is

dated 17.08. 2011. However according to the documentation submitted before this court by the

Petitioner, the Petitioner by letter dated 18th May 2012 had requested the 1st Respondent to deduct

check off of the said 27 employees (AI). The 1st Respondent by letter dated 28th May 2012 refused the

said check off (B) consequent to the said decision the Petitioner went before Labour Department and

by letter dated 19th October 2012 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner his decision. (G)

However when going through the said document produced marked 'G' this court observes that the said

letter refers to a previous communication by the industrial relations division on 17.08.2011 which is

produced marked F by the said Petitioner before this court.

The said document F is a decision communicated to the Petitioner by Assistant Commissioner of

Labour (Trade Unions) dated 17.08.2011 and in the said decision there is reference to discussions and

written submissions tendered by the parties before the Assistant Commissioner.

When compared the two documents the Petitioner is challenging before this court, I observe that it is

this document (F) which communicates the decision of the Assistant Commissioner but the 2nd letter

(G) is only a subsequent communication which confirm the decision in document marked 'F'.

As observed by me earlier, the Petitioner has failed to produce any document produced before the

inquiry conducted by the Assistant Commissioner (Trade Unions) and what is before this court is some

communication sent by the Petitioner to the Respondents but, there is no reference to discussions and

written submission as referred to in document F before this court.

5

At the argument before this court Respondents have brought these facts before us and argued that the

Petitioner is guilty of lashes, Deliberate falsehood, suppression and Misrepresentation of material facts

and therefore moved to dismiss this application.

As observed by me earlier, the decision the petitioner is challenging before this court is made on 1 i h

August 2011 and he had come before this court in July 2013. The Petitioner has failed to explain its

delay in coming before this court but, produced some documents to establish that the complaint was

first made in May 2012 and the subsequent correspondents were made between May 2012 and October

2012 and the decision was communicated to the Petitioner by letter dated 15.10.2012.

Even though the Petitioner has challenged the decision in 'F' and moved to quash the said decision,

the Petitioner has deliberately kept the proceedings of the said inquiry away from this court.

The second decision the Petitioner seek to quash i.e. document marked '0' too have been received by

the Petitioner's Office on 19.10.2012 and the Petitioner has produced marked 'H' the proceedings of a

meeting between the representatives of the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent held on 23.10.2012 in

order to clarify the position taken up by the 4th Respondent. Since then the Petitioner has taken 9

months to come before this court but he has failed to explain this delay before us. In the case of

President Malalgodapitiya Co-operative Society V. Arbitrator of eo-operative Societies Galle (1959)

151 NLR 167 Wijewardena CJ considered a delay of 07 months as follows,

"I do not think that in the circumstances of this case the Petitioners have made out a case

for obtaining relief from this court on this Petition as there has been undue delay in

applying for the Writ."

6

Jayasuriya (J) in the case of Jayaweera V. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura

and Another 1996 (2) Sri LR 70 whilst discussing the question of delay observed;

"A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has discretion to deny him relief having

regard to the conduct, delay, lashes, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief."

A part from delay in making the present application, as observed by me earlier, the Petitioner has

suppressed certain facts from this court. In the document produced marked 'F' which carries a

decision by the Assistant Commissioner of Labour (Trade Unions) dated 17.08.2011 there is reference

to discussions and written submissions tendered by the parties before the said Assistant Commissioner

but the Petitioner neither referred to such meetings in its Petition nor, annexed any documentation with

regard to the correspondents with Assistant Commissioner of Labour (Trade Unions) in the year 201l.

It appears that this is a deliberate act by the Petitioner to suppress a long delay from this court.

Even though the Petitioner had made all measures possible to suppress this fact they were compelled

to produce document marked 'F' before this court since there was reference to document 'F' in the

document 'G' which was relied by the Petitioner.

As observed by me earlier, when compared the document 'G', document 'F' was the letter which

carried the decision of the 3rd Respondent to the Petitioner but the Petitioner has made all endeavors to

suppress the process under which said document was issued by not bringing any correspondence with

regard to the meetings with the 3rd Respondent.

The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of material facts were discussed by Pathirana J in the case of

Alponso Appuhamy V. Hettiiarachchi 1973 NLR 131 as follows,

" .... the necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before

the court when an application for a Writ or injunction, is made and the process of the

court is invoked is laid down in the case of the King v. The General Commissioner for

the purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess

Edmond de Poignac [1917KB Div-486] Although this case deals with a Writ of

Prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all cases of Writs or Injunction. In

this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the

rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material

to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that

there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and

therefore it was justified in refusing a Writ of Prohibition without going into the merits of

the case. In other words so rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all

material facts that the court would not go into the merits of the application, but will

dismiss it without further examination .... "

In the case of Sarath Hulangamuwa V. Siriwardena, Principle Visaka Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 and

The Others 1986 (1) Sri LR 275, Court of Appeal observed the importance of both the delay in

seeking remedy and non disclosure of the material facts as follows,

"Certiorari being a discretionary remedy will not be granted where there was;

a) Such delay in seeking the remedy as would frustrate the remedy even if it could be

granted as the class had reached the third term and the child herself was now

overaged

c) Want of uberrimae fides in that there was non -disclosure of the material facts that the

Petitioner had a residence in Dehiwela far away from Visaka Vidyalaya and the child

had since gained admission to Bishops College, Colombo.

When considering the fact and circumstances of the present case this court is of the view that the

Petitioner is guilty of deliberate suppression of material facts and delay in seeking remedy from this

Court. Therefore I decided to dismiss this application without cost.
