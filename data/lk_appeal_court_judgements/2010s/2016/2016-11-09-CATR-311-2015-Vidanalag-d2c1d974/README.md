Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

Defendant-Petitioner in the present application has come

before this Court seeking an order to transfer the District Court of

Gampaha Case No. 1783/L under provisions of Section 46 of the

Judicature Act. When this matter was supported for notices, the Court

after going through the papers filed before this Court had issued

notices on all the Respondents. As observed by this Court the

Respondents came before this Court on notices on 28.09.2015 and

continued to be represented before this Court until 04.11.2015. However

since then the Respondent was not represented before Court even

2

after sending several notices on the Respondents.

However the respondents were well aware of this case for

two reasons.

Firstly the Court had issued an interim order when the

matter was supported before this Court on 01.09.2015 and the said

stay order had been extended time to time.

Secondly the Respondents were represented by a Counsel

before this Court on several dates and moved time to file objections

but subsequently decided not to come before this Court. Therefore we

are satisfied that the Respondents are well aware of the proceedings

but decided not to come before this Court. Since no objections had

been filed and the Respondents are absent and unrepresented the Court

decided to take up this matter for inquiry today. During the inquiry

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner brought to our notice an

order which was produced before this Court marked "Z". The said

order had been made by the Additional District Judge of Gampaha on

29.05.2015 and according to the petitioner an application had been

made by the petitioner to present application to intervene In the said

case No. 1691M0rtgage had been dismissed by the Additional District

Judge and in the said order she had referred to the deed which is the

3

subject matter of the present application before us. While referring to

the said order made by the Additional District Judge the learned

Counsel brings to our notice that the Additional District Judge had

made references with regard to the deed which is the subject matter

in the present application. The Respondents are absent and they have

not filed any objections before us challenging the position taken up

by the Petitioner before this Court. When considering all these matters

and also considering the fact there are more than one Additional

District Judge in the District Court of Gampaha, we decide to make

order to transfer this case under Section 46 of the Judicature Act

directing another Additional District Judge other than the Additional

District Judge who heard the case No. 169/Mortgage to hear and

determine the present case of No. 1783/L.

We direct the learned District Judge of Gampaha to

nominate a different Judge other than the Additional District Judge

who heard the case No. 169/Mortgage to hear and determine this case ..
