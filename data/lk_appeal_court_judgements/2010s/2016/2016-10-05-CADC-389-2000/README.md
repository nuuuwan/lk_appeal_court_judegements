The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Plaintiff"), instituted this

action on 07.09.1993, against the Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as lithe Defendant") in the District Court of Colombo for a declaration of title to Lot

12 and Lot 3 in Plan No.1446 dated 07.07.1998 made by K.P. Wijeweera, Licensed

Surveyor. The Plaintiff further averred that on or about 19.12.1992 the Defendant

had encroached upon the said Lot 3 which was part of his land and thereby

prevented the Plaintiff from having access to his land.

The Defendant filed answer on 21.09.1994 denying the claim of the Plaintiff and

stating that he was entitled to and in possession of lot 11 and he had not

encroached on the said lot 3 but had been in long and prescriptive possession of

that portion with his main land lot 11.

The Plaintiff stated that he had made a complaint about this encroachment to the

police and the Mediation Board which could not settle the matter and the non-

settlement resulted in the institution of action.

On 13.01.1997, when the case was taken up for trial, the Plaintiff raised issues 1-6

and 12-14 and the Defendant raised issues No.7 to 11. It is admitted by the parties

that by a final partition decree entered in case No.5387/P in the District Court of

Colombo, the Plaintiff's predecessors in title became entitled to lot 12 and the

Defendant's predecessors in title became entitled to lot 11 in Plan No.188 dated

02.02.1954 made by G.W. Fernando, licensed Surveyor and filed of record in the

said partition action.

A perusal of the pleadings indicates that the Plaintiff has described lot 12 in the

schedule to the plaint and the Defendant has described lot 11B in the schedule to

his answer. The issues No.1 and 2 raised by the Plaintiff refer to his title and

possession of lot 12, that is to say whether, as stated in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 in

the plaint the Plaintiff is entitled to the land in suit and whether he has prescriptive

title to the said land.

Both these issues have been answered in the affirmative by the learned District

Judge. Hence, admittedly, the Plaintiff has proved his paper title as we" as

prescriptive title and possession to the said lot 12. If that be so, the Plaintiff is

entitled to the whole of lot 12, including lot 3 in Plan No.1446, which is alleged to

be encroached upon by the Defendant.

Issue 12 refers to the title of the Plaintiff to lot 12 and lot 3. It has to be recalled

that issue no.1 in relation to lot 12 (the main land) had already been raised.

Therefore I observe that joining lot 12 with lot 3 and framing issue no.12, as has

been done in this case, is erroneous. The learned District Judge having answered

issue no.1 in the affirmative and thereby holding the Plaintiff is entitled to the

schedule to the Plaintiff has contradicted himself by answering issue no.12 against

the Plaintiff. Issue No.1 as to ownership of lot 12 has been answered in the

affirmative in favor of the Plaintiff. Issue No.12 too raised the ownership of the

3

\

Plaintiff to Lot No.12 which included Lot No.3. Thus the answer given by the

learned District Judge that the Defendant has a right to Lot 12 and 3 is erroneous. I

have to point out that issue no.12 should been split or disjunctively framed

pertaining to lot 3, which was in dispute.

In fact issue no.12 raised by the Plaintiff went as follows-

"/s the defendant, though he is entitled to Lot 118 by deed No. 3155 dated 15.05.1961 and attested by S. Wickramasinghe, Notary public, not entitled to Lot 12 or a portion on the Northern boundary of Lot 12 belonging to the plaintiff?"

It is this issue which was answered in the affirmative by the learned District Judge.

When the Plaintiff is admittedly proved to be entitled to Lot 12, (as issues 1 and 2

are answered in the affirmative), how can he be declared not entitled to Lot 12 or a

portion thereof? Thus the answer of the learned District Judge to this issue is quite

inconsistent with the answer he gave to issue no.1.

It is very clear that there is no dispute between the parties as to their respective

title to the said Lot 12 by the Plaintiff and lot 118 by the Defendant. The dispute is

only about the allegedly encroached portion which is identified by surveyor K.P.

Wjeweera as Lot 3 in his Plan No.1446. Hence, this Court has to consider only this

matte in this appeal.

Whilst the Plaintiff states that the Defendant has encroached on this Lot 3 on or

about 19.12.1992 and thereby obstructed his right of way which existed in the

North of his main land (Lot 12), the Defendant states in evidence that he has been

in possession of the said portion for over 30 years -see page 6 of proceedings dated

05.01.2000. The question is tlwhen did this obstruction and encroachment take

place?" Did it take place recently or a long time ago? For this purpose, the Court

should not take into consideration the age of the Defendant's house. The alleged

encroachment is nothing to do with the house. This case is about the portion of the

land on the Northern boundary of the Plaintiff's land where no house is standing.

This is a vacant lot as the evidence has unfolded.

It is clearly established by the evidence of the surveyor Wijeweera that the said

portion marked as Lot 3 in his Plan (P8) is a portion of the Plaintiff's land. He has

very clearly stated that this Lot 3 is encroached upon by the Defendant. This

evidence is not contradicted by the Defendant or by any other evidence. It is also

4

I

prove that he has prescribed to Lot 3 or that he has adverse possession of that lot.

In this regard Section 110 of the Evidence Ordinance is quite pertinent.

Section 110 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

"When the question is whether any person is owner of anything of which he is shown to be in possession, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner. "

Accordingly, the burden is on the Defendant to prove that the Plaintiff is not the

owner of Lot 3. In the case of Bandulhamy v. Tikirihamy,l it was held that where

the Plaintiffs and their predecessors have been proved to be in possession of a land

the burden of proving that they were not the owners lies upon the Defendant. The

Defendant has failed to discharge this burden satisfactorily. Therefore, the Plaintiff

must succeed in his claim.

Considering the evidence led in this case, I am of the view that the Plaintiff, by his

oral and documentary evidence (documents marked P1 to P8) has satisfactorily

proved his title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint. He has also

proved that the Defendant has encroached upon a portion of his land which is

identified as Lot 3 in Plan No.1446 (P8). This evidence of the Plaintiff has been

accepted and favorably commented upon by the learned District Judge in his

judgment -see pages 199 to 201.

I take the view that the learned District Judge misdirected himself with respect to

the material issues before him which resulted in his arriving at a wrong decision in

the case. The judgment of the learned District Judge is therefore set aside and the

appeal is allowed granting judgment for the Plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint.
