This is a revision application from the High Court of Panadura. The

history of this application is along these lines.

The Petitioner filed an application for bail on behalf of the Suspect

Respondent who was in remand on suspicion of having possession of

heroin. The Petitioner being the wife of the Suspect moved for bail. The

learned High Court Judge decided that there are no exceptional

circumstances and refused bail. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the

Petitioner moved in revision stating that the Suspect was in remand for

nearly two years, there is a discrepancy of the quantity of heroin in the

Government Analyst report and the police report, the B report does not

disclose where the heroin was found from the Suspect and the heroin was

not in actual possession of the Suspect are exceptional grounds to grant bail.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents raised several preliminary objections; firstly

that the Petitioner has failed to avert the exceptional circumstances to

invoke Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court and secondly that the

Petitioner has no locus standi. On conclusion of the argument, the

Respondents brought to the notice of Court that the indictment was

dispatched to the relevant High Court and the status of the suspect was

changed. Under the new circumstances, the suspect became an accused and

he can make an application for bail afresh but the Petitioper did not respond.

The order on a bail application in High Court is considered as a final

order within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code. It has been

observed by Eric Basnayake J. in the case of Cader (On behalf of Rasheed

Kahan) v. Officer In Charge Narcotic Bureau [2006] 3 Sri L R 74 that "the

orders refusing to grant bail are considered as final orders which appeals

lie." The Petitioner, as of a right, would have appealed against the order of

3

the Learned High Court Judge, but have opted to petition this Court to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. When the right of appeal is available, the

revisionary jurisdiction is exercised by the appellate courts to prevent the

miscarriage of justice. It has been held in the case of Vnik Incorporation

Ltd. v. Jayasekara [1987] 2 Sri L R 365 that;

In Perera v. Muthalib (supra) Soertsz, J. set out that the revisionary

powers of the Supreme Court are not limited to those cases in which

no appeal lies or in which no appeal has been taken for some reason

and that the Court would exercise revisionary powers where there

has been a miscarriage of justice owing to the violation of a

fundamental rule of procedure, but that this power would be

exercised only when a strong case is made out amounting to a

positive miscarriage of justice. In that case the bond of surety had

been forfeited without an inquiry.

In the case of Attorney-General v. Podi Singho (supra) Dias, J. held

that even though the revisionary powers should not be exercised in

cases when there is an appeal and was not taken, the revisionary

powers should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances such as

(a) miscarriage of justice (b) where a strong case for interference by

the Supreme Court is made out or (c) where the applicant was

unaware of the order. Dias, J. also observed that the Supreme Court

in exercising its powers of revision is not hampered by technical rules

of pleading and procedure.

That was a case where a sentence below the minimum sentence

prescribed by law had been imposed.

Although both those cases were decided long before the present

Constitution was promulgated (incorporating Article 145) and the

4

amendment to section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code in 1988, the

Supreme Court expressed the view that its revisionary powers should

be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred due to a

fundamental rule of judicial procedure being violated, but only when

a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice .....

The revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is not hampered by the

availability of the right of appeal, but the courts are slaw in exercising the

discretionary jurisdiction unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Bank of Ceylon V Kaleel and others [2004} 1 Sri L R 284

(1) The court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has

gzven the plaintiff-petitioner an alternative remedy (s.754(2)) and

when the plaintiff has not shown the existence of exceptional

circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

Per Wimalachandra, J.

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged

must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous

which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary

person would instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such

a nature which would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Dharmaratne and another V Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others

[2003} 3 Sri L R 24

Per Amaratunga, J.

''Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

court selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method

of rectification should be adopted, if such a selection process is not

5

there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of

every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision

Application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature

has not given a right of appeal. "

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep

root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should not be

lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not indicate

that it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice'.

In the present case he Petitioner has fail to establish any exceptional

circumstances warranting this Court to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

The Petitioner's first point is that the suspect is in remand nearly for two

years. The intention of the Legislature is to keep in remand any person who

is suspected of or accused of possessing or trafficking heroin until the

conclusion of the case. The section 83( 1) of the Poisons, Opium, and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance express the intention of the Legislature. It is

enacted by the Parliament that "No person suspected or accused of an

offence under section 54A or section 54B of this Ordinance shall be

released on bail, except by the High Court in exceptional circumstances. "

The suspect in the present case has been previously convicted on similar

offences. Therefore, remanding itself, of a person of this caliber cannot be

an exceptional circumstance to grant bail.

The second point of the Petitioner is that the quantity of heroin stated

in the police report is different from the quantity stated in the government

analyst report. The government analyst reports the amount of pure heroin

after analyzing the substance but the police measure it with all the

impurities. Therefore, it is natural to have a difference in quantity between

these two reports. The third and the fourth points raised by the Petitioner as

6

exceptional grounds are that the B report does not disclose where the heroin

was found from the Suspect and the heroin was not in actual possession of

the Suspect. These two are matters that have to be established by the

prosecution at the trial.

The points raised by the Petitioner cannot be considered as

exceptional grounds to grant bail. The learned High Court Judge correctly

refused bail.

We see no reason to interfere with the learned High Court Judge's

finding. The application dismissed. We order no costs.
