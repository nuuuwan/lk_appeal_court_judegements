JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Upon 4th Respondent making an application to the Commissioner of Labour

on 2012-09-24 alleging that h.is service was unlawfully terminated by the.

Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent (Deputy Commissioner of Labour) has held

an inquiry in terms of the provisions of the Termination of Employment of

4

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

"Act"). In the course of the inquiry the Petitioner has raised two

preliminary objections. They are as follows:

I. that the 4th Respondent's employment has been terminated on

disciplinary grounds and hence, the provisions of section 2 (4) of the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.

45 of 1971 as amended, will not apply and therefore the

Commissioner of Labour does not have jurisdiction to hear and

determine the application made by the 4th Respondent.

II. that the Commissioner of Labour does not have jurisdiction to hear

and determine the said application made by the 4th Respondent, as

the 4th Respondent had only been in employment for approximately

09 months and hence, the provisions of the Act do not apply to the

Petitioner in terms of section 3 (1) (b) of the Act.

The 3rd Respondent having afforded an opportunity for the Petitioner to be

heard, has overruled both preliminary objections. It is those two orders of

the ~rd Respondent marked respectively as P 1~ and P 15 that are being

challenged in these proceedings.

5

Section 2 (4) of the Act is as follows:

"For the purposes of this Act, the scheduled employment of any workman

shall be deemed to be terminated by his employer if for any reason

whatsoever, otherwise than by reason of a punishment imposed by way of

disciplinary action, the services of such workman in such employment are

terminated by his employer, and such termination shall be deemed to

include -

(a) non-employment of the workman in such employment by his

employer, whether temporarily or permanently, or

(b) non-employment of the workman in such employment in

consequence of the closure by his employer of any trade,

industry or business."

Admittedly the Petitioner has not issued a letter when he terminated the

service of the 4th Respondent. Learned President's Counsel for the

I?etitioner relied on the document marked P .02 in which the 4th

Respondent is reported to have confessed to a misconduct committed by

him. This letter has been written 'by the 4th Respondent on 2012-07-04.

However, in the subsequent complaint the 4th Respondent had made to the

6

Commissioner of Labour on 2012-09-24, he explains the circumstances

under which he was forced to make the previous statement. In the

document marked P 03 (bl (which is the complaint the 4th Respodent has

made to the Commissioner of Labour) he has also stated that he made a

complaint to the Cinnamon Gardens Police station with regard to the

situation he had to face at the hands of the Petitioner. The 4th Respondent

has further stated in that complaint that the Cinnamon Gardens Police

station inquired into his complaint after which he withdrew the said

complaint on the promise that his job would be given back.

No evidence other than the purported confession has been placed before

the inquiring officer by the Petitioner to establish that the 4th Respondent's

service was terminated on disciplinary grounds.

As has been mentioned before, the Petitioner has not issued any letter of

termination of service to the 4th Respondent. Therefore, in the face of two

rival positions taken up respectively by the Petitioner and the 4th

Respondent, it is not possible for the inquiring officer to hold with the

Petitioner as th~re is no basis to prefer the Petitioner's posi~ion to that of

the 4th Respondent. Indeed, this question would be a question that the

inquiring officer may have to decide in the course of the inquiry as it has

7

become a disputed fact. Therefore this court is unable to accept the

submission of the learned President's Counsel who appeared for the

Petitioner, that the ruling given by the 3rd Respondent in respect of the 1st

preliminary objection cannot stand and hence should be quashed by a writ

of Certiorari.

It is the submission of the learned president's counsel for the Petitioner

with regard to his other preliminary objection, that the Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971, as

amended will not apply to the 4th Respondent as in terms of the provisions

of section 3(1)(b) of the Act, the employee concerned, should have been in

employment for a period of 180 days in a Continuous period of 12 months.

As the 4th Respondent had only been in employment for approximately 09

months, his submission is that the 3rd Respondent has no jurisdiction to

hear and determine the aforesaid application made by the 4th Respondent.

Section (3) of the Act is as follows:

1) The provisions of this Act, other than this section, shall not apply-

(a) to an employer by whom less than fifteen workmen on an

average have been employed during the period of six months

8

preceding the month in which the employer seeks to

terminate the employment of a workman; or

(b) to the termination of employment of any workman who has

been employed by an employer a period of less than one

hundred and eighty days inclusive of -

i. every day of absence on any ground approved by the

employer;

ii. every day of absence due to any injury to the

workman caused by an accident arising out of, and in

the course of his employment;

iii. every day of absence due to anthrax or any

occupational disease specified in Schedule III of the

Workman's Compensation Ordinance;

iv. every day on which the employer fails to provide work

for the workman;

v. every day of absence due to. a lockout, or strike that

is not illegal, if such days do not in the aggregate

exceed thirty days; and

\ I I -

9

vi. every holiday or day of absence from work to which a

workman is entitled, by or under, the provisions of

any written law,

in the continuous period of twelve months commencing from the date of

employment if such termination takes place within that period of twelve

months; or ............ "

The requirements set out in section 3(1)(b), which must exist for the Act

not to apply, could be listed as follows,

i. the workman should have been employed for a period less than 180

days, inclusive of the days described in limbs (i) - (vi) in that section.

ii. the above 180 days must be within a continuous period of 12 months

commencing from the date of employment.

iii. termination should have taken place within that period of twelve

months which is described in No. (ii) above.

It is clear, from the way Section 3(1)(b) is worded, that all of the abOve 3

requirements must exist for the Act not to apply.

Purpose of section 3 (1) of the Act is to clearly specify a minimum period

that an employee should have worked under an employer within a period

10

of twelve months. The phrase that "if such termination takes place within

that period of twelve months 11 in section 3 (l)(b) shows that a termination

could take place "within" "that period of twelve months." This means that it

is not open to interpret this section to require that an employee should

have worked for a continuous period of twelve months to be eligible for the

protection under this Act.

Indeed the 4thRespondent would have worked for more than one year if

not for abrupt termination of his service by his employer. Thus it would not

be logical to say that the 4th Respondent would have protection under the

provisions of this Act only after he completes one year of service. If such

an interpretation is possible then "a period of less than 180 days" in section

3 (b) would become redundant. In these Circumstances the second

argument of the learned President's Counsel should also fail.

In view of the above, it is clear that the provisions of the Act would apply

to this incident of termination of service as the 4th Respondent has a

service of more than 180 days in the continuous period of twelve months

defined in section 3(1)(b) of the .Act. In these circumstances, this court is

unable to agree with the submission made by the learned President's

Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner that the decision made by the

1 ! I

J I

11

inquiring officer on the 2nd preliminary objection should be quashed by a

writ of Certiorari.

The inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour is yet to proceed. All the

relevant questions could be considered in detail at the said inquiry if such

a need arises.

In these Circumstances, we see no basis as to why the decisions made by

the 3rd Respondent contained in the documents marked P 13 and P 15

should be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. Therefore we decide to dismiss

this application. No cost is ordered.

Application is dismissed.
