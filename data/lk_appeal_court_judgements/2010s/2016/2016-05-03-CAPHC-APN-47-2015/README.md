The 2nd Party - Respondent - Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to intervene by setting

aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated

15.07.2014.

The facts that need to be mentioned in brief to appreciate the issue

involved in this application are as follows:-

Pursuant to information filed by the Officer in Charge of Welikada

Police Station, in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in terms of Section 66

of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the notice was displayed at the place of

dispute and a date was fixed for affidavits of parties.

When the case was called on the next date (02.06.2014) Counsel for

the Respondent sought a further date to submit her affidavit. The learned

Primary Court Judge refused the said application and the matter was

concluded before the Primary Court.

Aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate dated

02.06.2014, the 1 st Party Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Respondent) preferred a Revision Application to the Provincial High

Court of Colombo to have the Order of the learned Magistrate set aside.

The learned High Court Judge revised the said Order of the Magistrate

dated 15.07.2014 and as a result, the proceedings of the Primary Court re-

commenced. Upon an application made by the Respondent, the learned

5

Magistrate has issued an interim order dated 05.11.2014, against the

Petitioner preventing him altering the disputed premises adverse to the

Respondent's rights until the final determination of the case.

After receiving notices of the said interim order, the Petitioner

appeared before the Court and contended that since the dispute is being

considered in the District Court of Colombo, the learned Primary Court

Judge lacks jurisdiction to determine the dispute preferred under the Section

66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The learned Primary Court Judge by her Order dated 16.03.2015

rejected the aforesaid objection. In this backdrop, the Petitioner has

preferred this application after ten months challenging the Order made by

the learned High Court Judge dated 15.07.2014.

This application was listed for support on 03.07.2015. Before this

application was supported by the Counsel for the Petitioner, the learned

Counsel for the Respondent raised four preliminary objections on the

maintainability of this application and objected to the issuance of notice and

to granting interim reliefs and moved to have rejected and dismissed the

application in limine.

Learned Counsel for the parties made submissions and subsequently

tendered written submissions.

Counsel for the Respondent submitted that this application should be

rejected and dismissed in limine for the following reasons:

(a) The Petitioner had acquiesced and / or accepted the Order of the

Provincial High Court and thereby estopped from seeking any

6

relief from this Court against the said Order of the Provincial High

Court dated 15.07.2014;

(b) There is delay and or I laches on the part of the Petitioner and that

no acceptable explanation has been given;

( c ) the Petitioner has suppressed and! or misrepresented material facts;

(d) the Petitioner has failed to tender material documents and exhibits

and therefore failed to comply with the Court of appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990.

The first objection on which the learned Counsel for Respondent

relied is acquiescing and!or accepting the Order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 15.07.2014. Elaborating the said objection the learned Counsel

contended, knowing that the learned High Court Judge had made an order,

the Petitioner disregarding it, on 18.12.2014 made an application before the

learned Magistrate to raise a preliminary objection on the next date. Further

contended, before making that application the Petitioner was present and I or

represented by a Counsel on several dates. The stance of the Counsel is,

since 18.12.2014 the Petitioner was present and I or represented by a

Counsel without challenging the order made by the learned High Court

Judge dated 15.07.2014, and thereby the Petitioner had acquiesced and I

or accepted the said Order of the learned High Court Judge. His contention

is that by reason of his acquiescence, the Petitioner is precluded in law from

invoking the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court.

7

It is the contention of the Counsel for the Petitioner, whether the

impugned order was challenged or not, a party cannot acquiesce to an order

which is on the face of it a nullity. Then a question arises, having

knowledge of the said impugned order at that time why the Petitioner did not

challenge it. Instead of that the Petitioner has raised a preliminary objection

with regard to the jurisdiction of the Primary Court. It is relevant to note

that the Petitioner has not given a plausible answer for the question.

In support of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

Respondent, the attention of the Court has been drawn to several decided

cases. It was decided in Nagalingam vs. Lakshman de Mel 78 NLR 231, if a

party, having participated in a prolonged proceedings without any objection

and having taken the chance of the final outcome of the proceedings, is

precluded from raising any objection. Further, it was held, the jurisdictional

defect, if any, has been cured by the Petitioner's consent and acquiescence.

In Alagappa Chitty vs. Arumugam Chitty (2 C.L. Rep.202) it was

held, "Where jurisdiction over the subject matter exists requiring only to be

invoked in the right way, the party who has invited or allowed the Court to

exercise it in a wrong way cannot afterwards tum round to challenge the

legality of proceedings due to his own invitation or negligence.

It is to be noted, that the consent or lack of objection prevents the

Petitioner from relying on the irregularity and from complaining the

illegality of the Order. The Petitioner had not objected to the proceedings

continuing after he appeared or / represented before the Magistrate's Court

after on 18.12.2014, on the basis that the purported Order made by the

learned High Court Judge on 15.07.2014. Instead, the Petitioner raised a

8

preliminary objection with regard to the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's

Court, complaining that since the dispute is being considered in the District

Court of Colombo the learned Primary Court Judge lacks jurisdiction to

determine the dispute. When the said preliminary objection was overruled

and dismissed, the Petitioner has decided to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court.

As has been contended by the Counsel for the Respondent, I have no

difficulty in upholding the contention that by reason of the acquiescence, the

Petitioner is precluded in law from invoking the Revisionary Jurisdiction of

this Court.

The next objection that has to be considered is namely, undue delay in

filing this application. Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that there is no

undue delay in the present application and even if there may be a short delay

that too has been explained by the Petitioner.

It is relevant to note, that the Petitioner is seeking by an application

filed in the Court of Appeal Registry on the lih of May 2015, to claim from

this Court discretionary relief in respect of an alleged order made on

15.07.2014. As such, there was a delay of over ten months since the making

of the order for these papers to be filed, in the Court of Appeal. In the case

of The Attorney General Vs. Kunchitambu 46 N.L.R. 401, the delay of

three months was held to disentitle the Petitioner for relief.

Where there has been a delay in discretionary relief, it is essential that

reasons for the delay should be set out in the Petition. (Dasanayake vs.

Fernando 71 N.L.R. 356.)

9

Now it is necessary to consider, whether the explanation of the

Petitioner with regard to his delay is acceptable.

It is stated in Paragraph 14 of the Petition, since the owner of the

premises in question has already sought to resolve the dispute with the

Respondent before the District Court, he did not seek to challenge the Order

of the learned High Court Judge dated 15.07.2014. He further stated that

since the preliminary objection has been overruled by the learned Magistrate

he was compelled to challenge the said Order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 15.07.2014. In the written submissions filed in this Court by the

Respondent, it was contended that, since the matter in dispute has being

considered in the appropriate forum, Petitioner bonafide advised himself not

to challenge the order of the learned High Court Judge at that juncture and

sought to take up a preliminary objection before the Primary Court with

regard to the maintainability of the action.

The stance of the Counsel for the Petitioner is when the Court is

invited to dismiss a revisionary application on the ground of delay, the same

should be carefully considered. To substantiate this position the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to several

decided cases.

The Court must carefully consider the explanation adduced for the

delay. The question whether the delay is fatal to an application in revision

depends on the particular facts and circumstances of the case.

The Petitioner has been silent over the application for over ten months

without any reasonable reason. It was revealed at the hearing of this case,

that before filing this application the Petitioner had made an application after

10

ten months to the High Court seeking to set aside the said impugned order

made by the learned High Court Judge on 15.07.2014 on the basis that the

order made by the learned High Court Judge was per inquiram. That

application has been dismissed.

It is relevant to note upon an application made by the Respondent, the

learned Magistrate has issued an interim order dated 05.11.2014 against the

Petitioner preventing him from altering the disputed premises adverse to the

Respondent's rights, until the final determination of the case. The

Respondent after complaining to the Magistrate's Court that the Petitioner

has violated the interim order the Petitioner had been charged for contempt

of Court. I am of the view, that the reason for filing this belated application

is because the Petitioner had been charged for contempt of Court.

The long period of inaction and failure to seek relief on the part of the

Petitioner was fatal to an application in Revision. The Court has discretion to

refuse the application on the ground of undue delay in commencing the

proceedings. As such on this ground alone this application should be

rejected.

The next objection that has to be considered is whether the Petitioner

is guilty of suppression or misrepresentation of facts. It is the contention of

the Counsel for the Respondent that, the Petitioner in his Petition has not

stated that he acquiesced in the proceedings before the Magistrate's Court,

which is significant in this case. Since I have already dealt with that issue it

is not necessary to consider it again.

The Revisionary Power of this Court is a discretionary power and its

exercise cannot be demanded as of right unlike the statutory remedy of

11

Appeal. It was held in T. Varapragasam and Another vs. S.A. Emmanuel

C.A. (Rev) - 931184 - CAM 24.07.91 that the following tests have to be

applied before the discretion of the Court of Appeal is exercised in favour of

a party seeking the revisionary remedy.

(a) The aggrieved party should have no other remedy. (Already a civil

case has been filed).

(b) The aggrieved party must come to Court with clean hands and

should not have contributed to the current situation. (The Petitioner

has been charged for contempt of Court).

(c) The aggrieved party should have complied with the law at that

time. (The impugned order has not been challenged at the proper

time).

(d) The acts complained of should have prejudiced his substantial

rights.

(e) The acts of circumstances complained of should have occasioned a

failure of justice.

(f) There should not be any unreasonable delay III filing the

application. (There is a delay)

(g) There should be full disclosure of material facts and show uberime

fides as non disclosure is fatal.

(h)As the conduct of the Petitioner IS intensely relevant to the

granting of relief, such conduct should not be repellant to the

attractions of exercise of revisionary power.

The view of the Court is that the Petitioner has not fulfilled the

aforesaid requisites and therefore this is not a fit and proper case to invoke

the revisionary powers of this Court.

12

Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in this

revision application to set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge, is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter

of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief still the Court has a discretion to

deny his relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver and

submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments which should stand

against the grant of relief.

F or the reasons stated above, I uphold the preliminary objections

raised by the Counsel for the Respondent. This application is accordingly

dismissed.
