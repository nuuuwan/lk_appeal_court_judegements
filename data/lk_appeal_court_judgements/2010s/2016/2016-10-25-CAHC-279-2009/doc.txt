K.K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

Accused-Appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Counsel for the accused-appellant states as follows:

" This is a matter where the accused had been convicted for bribery and

acceptance and solicitation by the High Court of Colombo on

25.11.2009. Since such date he has been incarcerated serving a

sentence of 3 years on the count of solicitation and 3 years on the

count of acceptance. Both to run consecutively together with a fine of

Rs.50,000 / - with a default term. He is at the tail end of his career and

has no hope of resuming his government position back in the

agricultural department. My application to Court is whether a

concession of some sort could be considered with regard to the question

of sentence particularly because he has virtually completed serving his

sentence since the date of conviction. He chooses upon advice given

not to waste anymore judicial time as if the matter is contested and

evidence gone into no one can predict the ultimate result. My prayer to

this Court is that the accused-appellant be given a noncustodial

sentence effective from the date of his conviction which would mean

that his sentence would have to be reduced to 2 years rigorous

imprisonment. The fine may remain unaltered. At the end of the day

justice would have been met out that no prejudice caused to the

respondent or any other party".

Learned Senior States Counsel states as follows-

" I do concede the position that the accused had been in remand

custody since the date of conviction, i.e. 25.11.2009. Initially he was

sentenced totally for 6 years. The learned High Court Judge imposed a

sentence of 3 years for the first count and another 3 years in respect of

the second count and he ordered the two sentences to take effect

consecutively. Therefore, if he considered the date of conviction his

sentence would have been over in November 2015. I do concede that

his freedom had been incarcerated for a long period. Therefore, I will

not standing the way for granting certain concession to the accused. I

leave the decision in the hands of Your Lordship and Your Ladyship

Court and the Court can suspend the sentence with effect from today".

Order

Considering the submissions made by the both parties we

obs~rve that the accused-appellant had been incarcerated for a long

time even more than the period that he was sentenced (since

25.11.2009). The Senior State Counsel also mentioned that he is

agreeable either to bring down the sentence or/and suspend the same.

Therefore, we affirm the conviction and we make order bringing down

the sentence of 3 years on each count to 2 years rigorous imprisonment

on each count to run concurrently and suspended the same for 5 years.

We affirm the conviction and the fine of Rs.50,000/- to remain as it is.

Subject to the said variation, the appeal is hereby dismissed.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo forthwith.
