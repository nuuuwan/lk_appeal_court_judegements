CASE- NO- CA (PHC)- 116/2010- ORDER- 07.10.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal assails the orders of the Learned

High Court Judge dated 29.11.2010 and Learned

Magistrate dated 26.04.2010.

As stated In the petition of Appeal following are the

facts in brief;

The above impugned orders were In respect of

application made and information filed by the OIC In

the Police Station of Mannar In the Magistrate Court

of Manner, In terms of Section 66(1) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979,

regarding a land dispute which will climate to a

breach of the peace.

Consequently to the filing of the said report the

Learned Magistrate issued notices on all parties, and

after affixing the said notices the in tervenien t-

Petitioners -Appellants, also filed the affidavits and

contended thus;

That the subject

way of paternal

land belongs to the Appellants by

inheritance of their late father and

who inherited from their deceased father Assan Naina

Yoosuf, by virtue of Deed No. 534 dated 21.12. 1928

attested by Mohideen Pitche Marikkar, Notary Public.

It is the stance of the 2nd party Respondent that he

purchased the land In dispute from one Azeena,

widow of Abdul Cassim Marikkar by virtue of Deed

No. 7291 dated 02.05.2009 attested by M.B. Farook

Notary Public.

After the inquiry the Learned Magistrate has by his

order dated 26.04.2010 had placed the 2nd

Respondent in posseSSlOn.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Intervenient-

Respondents- Appellants made a reVlSlOn application to

the High Court of Manner to have the said order

vacated or revised.

The Learned

29. 11.2010

High Court Judge by his order dated

had dismissed the said Revision

application of the Petitioner-Appellants.

Being dissatisfied with the said order of the Learned

High Court Judge the Petitioner- Appellants had lodged

the instant appeal In this Court and impugned the

said order in ter alia on the permlS as stated below;

That the Learned High Court Judge has

raised

failed

by

to

the consider the preliminary objection

Appellant as to the legality of the affidavit tendered

by the 2nd party Respondent as the same is not in

conformity with the Section 168 of the Civil

Procedure Code, and as such moved the said affidavit

to be rejected in limine.

f Il

II,

It IS further alleged by the Appellants that the day

on which was fIxed for order as to the restoration

of the stay order the Learned High Judge has

dismissed the reVlSlOn application of the Petitioner-

Appellants.

It IS seen from the information fIled by the officer

In charge of the Manner police station In terms of

Section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the

relevant parties position has been that they have title

to the disputed land. Therefore it IS contended by

the Petitioner- Appellants that the Learned Magistrate

should have resolve the dispute under Section 69 (1)

of the said Act as to the parties title to the land

and not on the basis who was In possession of the

land two months pnor to the fIling of the

information report in court.

It is salient to note that the Learned Magistrate has

at the request of the parties inspected the disputed

land. At the said inspection the Learned Magistrate

has observed the fact that the 2nd party Respondent

has cleared a larger extent of land and the

boundary stones had been flXed along the boundary

of the disputed land without any objection either

from the 1st Party- Respondent and the Petitioner-

Appellants. Hence the Learned Magistrate has formed

the oplnlOn that 2nd Respondent had exercised his

title to the land and cleared a large portion of the

8

l!f I

land after purchasing the same as stated above. And

was of the view that the 2nd Party Respondent has

acted In such manner to asserts his title and the

Learned Magistrate was of the view that in order to

preserve peace that the status quo should be in tact

and made order that the parties could vindicate their

title by instituting an action in the District Court

accordingly.

In the

Appellants

Manner,

Revision application

In the Provincial

the Learned High

filed

Court

by the

Judge

holden In

had made

the following observation in the said order, viz a viz.

That as per judgment of Sharavananda J. In KANAGASABAI

.VS. MAl LVAGANAM- 78 NLR- 280. It is trite that the

purpose of the order made in terms of Section 62 of

the Administration of Justice Law relating to the land

dispute is to avoid the breach of the peace, and as

the order made under the above section IS a

tentative, and that the parties could resolve the

matter finally in the District Court accordingly.

The Learned High Court in adverting to the case of

RAMALINGAM .VS. THANGARAJAH 1982 2 SLR-693 has

stated what emerged from the said case thus;

" the scheme embodied In this part IS geared to

achieve the object of the prevention of a breach of

the peace."

9

I; I! !

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the Learned

Magistrate has made the said impugned order in the

correct perspective in order to prevent the breach of

the peace, and had not decided the rights and the

title of the parties to the action,

AND

Further the Learned High Court Judge has also

commented that the Petitioners had instituted action

in the District Court to vindicate their title, and had

filed the instant revision application In the Provincial

High Court in order to delay the process of justice.

In the above setting the Learned High Court Judge

has affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate

and dismissed the application In revlslOn.

Being

High

aggrieved by the

Court Judge the

said order of the Learned

Petitioner-Appellants had filed

the instant appeal to this Court to have the said

order set aside or vacate.

In pursuan t to

of both parties

made by the

allowed them

Counsel

to file

The Counsel for the Respondent raised two

preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the

appeal on the grounds as stated below;

10

ttII I I! trtt

ft

i II I

That the failure on the part of the Appellants to

JOln the necessary parties to the action,

As the parties had instituted action In the District

Court to proceed with the instant appeal will be

purely academic.

It IS intensely relevant to note that most of the

parties intervened in the case filed in the Magistrate

Court under the Primary Court Act have not been

made parties to this appeal, and therefore it said

that the said failure is fatal and the appeal should

fail. To buttress the said proposition the counsel for

the Respondent has adverted court to many legal

pronouncements In the cases L.R. GUNASEKARA .VS.

R.A.S. PERERA-74. NLR.. 163, which has observed

thus;

"Failure

to JOln

adversely

renders

of the Appellant, in an appeal filed by

as a Respondent a party who will

him

be

affected if the appeal were to succeed

the appeal to be rejected if objection is

taken by a party respondent".

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the appeal

cannot proceed without necessary parties are not being

brought before court.

The above principle has been observed In the case

of NADARAJAH .VS. IBRAHIM- BSLA Law Journal Report

(1990).

11

III II

Thus moves to recognised the effect of the failure to

join necessary parties in the appeal.

It is also brough t to the notice of Court that the

land claimed by the 2nd Respondent, by virtue of

deed marked 2Rl 1S a land containing 1n extent 20

acres and the land claimed by the Appellants is a

land with 30 acres.

Therefore it 1S appropriate to resolve the dispute 1n

the District Court, which 1S the competent court for

the ultimate determination of the rights of the parties.

For the reasons expiated above the grounds of appeal

raised by the Petitioner- Appellants are devoid of

merits, and should stand rejected.

Accordingly we have dismissed the appeal, without

costs.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
