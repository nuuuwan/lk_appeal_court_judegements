P.R. Walgama, J

The Petitioner- Appellants had lodged the instant

appeal to assail the order of the Learned High Court

Judge dated 04.08.2010, by which order the Petitioner

c - Appellants application, for a mandate In the nature

of a writ of Certiorari was refused.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Appellants had

impugned the said order by the instant appeal to

this Court.

In the application to the Provincial High Court

holden at Anuradhapura the Petitioner - Appellants had

unfolded the following;

That the Petitioners, had from 1992 developed the

land described In the schedule thereto and was In

possesslOn of the same.

That the 2nd Petitioner has made an application to

the authority to obtain a permit in terms of Land

Development Act or under the State Lands Act.

It IS also been noted that there IS a dispute In

respect of the land In Issue between the 1 st

Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent.

It has been further alleged by the Petitioners that

the 1 st and the 2nd

Respondent. Therefore it IS contended by the

Petitioners that when the 2nd Respondent had taken

steps to Issue a legal document to the

Petitioner, but had deviated from the said procedure

by the 1st Respondent, and glVen

said decision of the 18t Respondent which IS to be

enforced by the 2nd Respondent is to be quashed by

writ of Certiorari, as moved by the Petitioner-

Appellants.

Therefore in the above setting the Petitioners move

for a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision taken

and contents of which are contained in the

documents marked P5, P6 and P8.

In objecting to the above application the Respondents

submit that the disputed land IS a state land and

the Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to hear

and make a determination of the said issue.

It is to be noted that the Petitioner- Appellants were

absent and unrepresented, even after receiving notice

of the date of argument. Therefore this Court IS

possessed only with the argument of the Respondents.

It IS trite law, that the Provincial High Court of

Anuradhapura stands denuded of jurisdiction as the

subject matter of the State lands does not come

within the purview of the Provincial List (list 1) of

the 9th Schedule to the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution.

It IS noted by virtue of Article

Constitution has recognised the power

Court to issue writs in the nature

only in respect of matters set out in the Provincial

Council list. In the said list it is apparent that the

subject of State Lands does not come with the said

ambit and as such as stated before the High Court

1S not empowered to adjudicate any matter pertaining

to the State Lands as the said subject 1S vested

with the Centre.

The said proposition was recognised by judgment

delivered in the case of SOLIMUTTU RASU .VS. THE

SUPRINTENDENT STAFFORD ESTATE-decided on

26.09.2013.

Therefore 1n the above exposition of the facts and

law, we reach to an irresistible conclusion that the

appeal being devoid of merit, deserve to be dismissed

and 1S dismissed accordingly.

We order no costs.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
