Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C. J (PICA)

This matter is coming up today for the Respondent to inform their

position with regard to the land in question. Learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent informs that the land

referred to in this application had been originally vested with the Ceylon

Government Railway during the time when the Udupussellawa railway

line was in operation. However, with the closing down of the said railway

line the A.G.A of the area without the knowledge of the Railway

Department had handed over the land to the National Housing

Development Authority and considering this fact the Railway Department

informs that they will not claim this land hereafter and therefore they will

not proceed with the action they have already filed in the Magistrate's

Court of Nuwara Eliya Case bearing No.56366.

In view of these submissions made by the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General the proceedings in this case are being terminated.

2

Registrar is directed to issue a certified copy of today's proceedings

to the Petitioner on payment of usual charges.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General at this stage seeks the

Court's permission to file the document that he has received from the

Railway Department along with a motion. This application is allowed.

Proceedings are terminated.
