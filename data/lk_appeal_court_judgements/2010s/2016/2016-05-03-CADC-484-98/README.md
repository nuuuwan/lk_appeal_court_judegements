Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Plaintiffs - Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants)

instituted the Partition Action bearing No. 46651P in the District Court of

Kalutara, seeking to partition the land described in the schedule thereto.

The learned District Judge of Kalutara dismissed the said Partition

Action by his Judgment dated 05.06.l998. The Appellants being aggrieved

by the said judgment filed this Appeal and it was taken up for argument on

28.09.2011. On that day Appellants were absent and unrepresented.

However the 1 st Defendant -Respondent and the 2nd Defendant -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st and 2nd Respondents) had been

represented by a Counsel. The Court had only heard submissions of the 1 st

and 2nd Respondents and dismissed the Appeal. While dismissing the

Appeal this Court had made an order excluding Lot No.2 and Lot No. 2A

from the Corpus.

The 20th and 21 st Defendants - Respondents - Petitioners (hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioners) filed a Petition and Affidavit on 15th of

November 2012 seeking to set aside the Order of this Court dated

11.01.2012 and to re-hear this Appeal. They have stated in the Petition and

Affidavit that the said Order was made by this Court without any hearing

being given to them; and also without notice of appeal being given to them.

The 1 st and 2nd Respondents objected to the application; as such the

matter was fixed for inquiry.

When the matter was taken up for inquiry on 13.l0.2015 Counsel for

both parties made oral submissions and subsequently tendered written

submissions.

12

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners, at the commencement of the

argument made submissions to the effect that the Petitioners and other

Defendants - Respondents were neither noticed to appear in Court nor given

a hearing, before the Court dismissed the Appeal.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondents is, that the

Petitioners have failed to substantiate their claim as stipulated in the

Provisions of Section 771 of the Civil Procedure Code in the context of the

presumption in Section 114 illustration (d) of the Evidence Ordinance in

regard to the proper performance of Official Acts and therefore the Registrar

of the Court of Appeal is presumed to have dispatched the relevant notices to

the Petitioners.

However, it is significant to note, that the Respondents have not

denied the contents of Paragraph 5 of the Petition in their objections.

Paragraph 5 of the Petition states as follows:

(5) "These two 20th and 21 st Defendants -Respondents -

Petitioners state that the said Order was made without any hearing being

given to them; and no notice of this Appeal being taken up was given to

these Defendants - Respondents - Petitioners".

When filing objections, if there is no specific denial of the facts

mentioned in the Petition, it should be considered as an acceptance of the

facts.

13

Accordingly, the first question arising for decision in this application

is whether the Order dated 11.01.2012 was made without duly serving the

Notice of Appeal on the Petitioners.

What is due notice? It was held in linadasa and Another V s. Sam

Silva and Others (1994) 1 S.L.R. 233, "Due notice for the purpose of the sort

of matter under consideration, is making information available in the usual

way, that is to say, in accordance with the prevailing law, rules, practices

and usages of the Court. Where information of the appointed date for

hearing is usually set out in a list prepared and published by the Court's

registry, and information of the hearing has been given in that way, that is

due notice to the parties and their Counsel".

It is to be noted that the case in hand had not been listed in the usual

way. The way in which cases were fixed for hearing in this Court is that

notice should have been personally served on the parties.

The stance of the Counsel for the Petitioners is that the Petitioners

were not noticed of the Appeal; only the Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd

Defendants - Respondents were noticed.

On perusal of the journal entries of this case dated 26.10.2009,

30.10.2009, 09.12.2011 and 28.09.2011 it is quite evident that only the

Appellants and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents were noticed. If, upon the

unrebutted oath of the absent party, the lack of due notice had been alleged,

the view of the Court is ordering reinstatement of the hearing is justified.

14

The next question is under what authority the Court could have

ordered the re-listing of an application. I am of the view the Court has the

power to restore the application to the list in the exercise of its inherent

jurisdiction.

The application before this Court is made in terms of Section 771 of

the Civil Procedure Code.

The Section 771 reads as follows:

"When an appeal is heard ex-parte in the absence of the respondents

and judgment is given against him, he may apply to the Court of Appeal to

rehear the appeal; and if he satisfies the Court that he was prevented by

sufficient cause from attending when the appeal was called on for hearing,

the Court may re-hear the appeal on such terms as to Court or otherwise as

the Court thinks fit to impose upon him ".

I am of the view that the Petitioners have established sufficient cause

for absence, when the appeal was called for hearing. Obviously, the party

had no due notice from the Court when the matter was to be heard, and as

such, the matter ought to be reinstated.

The right to be heard has little or no value unless the party has been

given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. It was held in State Graphite

Corporation vs. Fernando (1982) 2 S.L.R. 590, where a party wishes to be

heard or the issues involved are such, that the Court ought not to make an

order without hearing a party affected.

15

Having taken the above circumstances into consideration this Court is

of the view that the Order made on 11.01.2012 should be set aside, and the

application of relisting is allowed.
