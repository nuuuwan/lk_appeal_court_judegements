M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

Indra Ladduwahetty for the

Defendant - Appellant.

K.M. Basheer Ahamed with

M.R. Rahumathullah for the

Plaintiff - Respondent.

: 29th October, 2015

: 28th April, 2016

The plaintiff respondent instituted action against the defendant

appellant in the District Court of Colombo seeking relief in respect of

defendant's alleged acts of unfair competition based on Sec. 142 (1)

and (2) (a) of the Intellectual Property Act.

2

Both the plaintiff and the defendant are companies manufacturing

and selling sweets. The plaintiff respondent (hereafter referred as the

respondent) designed new wrappers and marketed its sweets under the

brand names CHIX and DAINTEE and put out different flavours. The

respondent took up the position that seeing the success of their sweets

in the new wrappers the appellant who claimed to be a confectioner

started marketing their sweets in wrappers resembling the wrappers

used by the respondent company. The appellant company claimed that

their wrappers did not resemble the respondent's wrappers, and that

their trade mark name USWA TIE is a striking feature of their wrappers.

At the trial before the District Court several witnesses have given

evidence and marked documents. The learned District Judge after

hearing their evidence has given his judgment in favor of the plaintiff

respondent. The learned District Judge on arriving at his ruling has

stated that the art work of the wrappers sent to Singapore for printing

compared with each other (P16 and P30) exposed a similarity clearly.

He also decided that the damages claimed by the respondent remained

unchallenged and uncontradicted and the damages claimed were

awarded.

The argument of the appellant was that their name is displayed

on the wrapper which indicated it was their product and that it is an act

3

of competition not contrary to honest practices in industrial or

commercial matters.

The appellant argued that the marketing of their products did not

cause any confusion since the word 'Uswatte' is a striking feature in the

wrapper while the respondent's toffees had the word Daintee on their

wrappers, therefore the wrapped toffees can not cause confusion. The

appellant stated that the learned District Judge erred in holding that the

design of the wrappers used by the appellant is an imitation of the

design used by the respondent. The appellant submitted that there was

no evidence of any similarity between the two and that the evidence did

not disclose any confusion.

The appellant stated that the learned District Judge erred in

holding that the appellant had committed an Act of unfair competition in

terms of Sec. 142 of the code of Intellectual Property Act. He further

stated that learned District Judge erred in holding that the respondent

suffered damages to its business and goodwill by answering issue no.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the

questions of law or matters in issue suggested by the appellant do not

arise since the evidence in the District Court proved that the appellant

put out inferior quality sweets copying the newly designed wrappers of

the respondent and that as a result the respondent suffered a bad name

and their sales dropped. The respondent also stated that the

respondent's sales went up with the newly designed wrappers which

fact was not challenged or disputed in the District Court. The

respondent further stated the fact that the appellant copied the

respondent's new wrapper because of its good sales, has also not been

challenged in the District Court.

Sec. 142 (1) and (2) (a) reads thus;

142 (1). Any act of competition contrary to honest practices

in Industrial or Commercial matters shall constitute

an act of unfair competition.

(2) Acts of unfair competition shall include the

following,

(a) All acts of such nature as to create confusion by any

means whatsoever with the establishment, the

goods, services or the Industrial or Commercial

activities of a competitor.

..

The relief sought was based on section 179.

The possibility of confusion could be seen when the wrappers are

compared as stated by the District Judge since these sweets are bought

mostly by children. The art work for the design of both wrappers are

similar the only difference being the brand names.

I

The volume of sales of the respondent was not challenged by the

appellant therefore it is not necessary for the respondent to prove the

volume of sales. The damages claimed was decided on the volume of

sales. The District Judge has analyzed the evidence correctly when

arriving at the quantum of damages.

On perusal of the judgment it could be said that the evidence

i,

placed before the learned District Judge had been carefully analyzed.

The District Judge has said the damages claimed went undisputed and

unchallenged after hearing and observing the witnesses and perusing

the documents marked before him.

\The appellant has failed to state any legal or factual basis on

which the learned District Judge's judgment should be set aside. On

perusal of the said judgment it could be seen that he has carefully

analyzed the law and the evidence placed before him. He had seen and

heard the witnesses who placed evidence before him.

For the afore stated reasons the judgment of the learned District

Judge is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs.50,000/=.
