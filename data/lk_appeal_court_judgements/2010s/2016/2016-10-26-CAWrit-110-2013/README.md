P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as the learned Counsel for the 1st

& 2nd Respondents when this case came up on 2016-07-25, requested this

Court, to pronounce the judgment after considering the written

submissions the parties have filed. They further informed court that as this

case is straight forward in its nature, it would not be necessary for them to

make oral submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based on the

material that have been adduced by parties in their written submissions.

Petitioner in this case is seeking a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/

or the 2nd Respondent to allocate him a shop in the new shopping complex

in the bus stand in Kaduwela. He insists that allocation of a shop to him

must be done before calling for tenders as the Chairman of Kaduwela

Pradeshiya Sabha has agreed to do so as per clause 8 of the document

marked and produced as X 4. He claims to have a legitimate expectation

for such an allocation on this document.

The Petitioner seeks from this court inter alia following releifs.

i. a writ of Certiorari quashing and lor revoking and/or canceling and/

or annulling the tender notice which appears in the "Deyayena"

news paper dated 2013-04-12 or any other public notice to that

effect,

4

ii. a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent and/ or the 2nd

Respondent to allocate a shop in the new shopping complex in the

Bus Stand in Kaduwela to the Petitioner, before calling for tenders to

lease out the shops in the new shopping complex in the Bus Stand in

Kaduwela,

It is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents

I. that the 1st & 2nd Respondents are not constructing a shopping

complex but a bus stand JOintly with the Western Province Road

Passenger Transport Authority,

II. that the 1 st Respondent is a lessee of the said Western Province Road

Passenger Transport Authority in terms of the lease agreement dated

1999-11-19,

III. that the documents marked X 1 to X 3 have been issued prior to the

date of signing the said lease agreement,

IV. that the document marked X 4 is a document to give preference at a

tender,

V. that the Petitioner had never paid assessment tax and was never in

legal occupation as a tenant of the 1st Respondent,

VI. that the Petitioner has no right or cannot have a legitimate

expectation as the Petitioner is a trespasser,

VII. that the 1st Respondent is bound to call tenders according to law and

no shops can be allocated without a tender procedure,

gt

JiI

5

VIII. that the document marked X 4 was only to give preference amongst

the tenderors,

IX. that the document marked X 10 does not state that the Petitioner

will be allocated a shop in the new complex,

X. that the tenders were called for, but the Petitioner failed to submit a

tender and as such the Petitioner has no legal right to maintain the

present action.

Further it is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that they never

gave an undertaking to the Petitioner to allocate a shop without his coming

forward to tender and without any payment being made in that regard. In

any event the 1st Respondent cannot in law allocate a shop to a trespasser

at the expense of public funds contrary to the accepted procedure.

It appears that no consideration has been paid by the Petitioner in respect

of the document marked X 4. Thus there is no legal duty cast on the

Respondents to allocate a shop to the Petitioner in the said bus stand free

of charge.

The document marked X 4 is a contractual agreement between the

Chairman of the Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha and the Petitioner and stands

as a commercial transaction between them. 1st and 2nd Respondents have

no involvement in that agreement. Therefore this application is

misconceived in law.

6

The said bus stand project is owned by the Western Province Peoples'

Transportation Authority and the Respondents handle only its

implementation.

In any case this Court cannot stop the 1st and 2nd Respondents from calling

for tenders in order to compel them to allocate a shop to the Petitioner

outside such tender procedure. Such a move would amount to a breach of

law and all norms that the legal system of this country is endeavoring to

uphold.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no merits in

this case. Therefore we decide to refuse this application. This application

should therefore stand dismissed with costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
