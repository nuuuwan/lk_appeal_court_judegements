Judgment on: 9th September 2016

K.K.Wickremasinghe J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was charged under section 296

of the penal code for committing murder of Wela Tantrige Tissa Boteju. Thereafter, the accused

appellant was convicted on the said count and the learned trial judge imposed the death

penalty on him on 23.02.2007.

Section 296 of the penal code states:

"Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death"

Counsel for the appellant informs court that he wishes to withdraw the appeal under section

359 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as quoted below:

"Any appellant or applicant as the case may be who has lodged an f", ... ~rtJeplication to the Court of Appeal under this code may at any time apply to the Court 0 ppeal to withdraw his appeal or application and such court may after such inquiry as it considers necessary, permit the withdrawal of such appeal or application on such terms as it may think fit to impose and thereupon the appeal or application shall stand dismissed.

Further Counsel for the appellant has made an application to backdate the sentence of the accused appellant under section 323(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as quoted below:

"The court of appeal may order that the time so spent by such appellant in custody or any part thereof shall be reckoned as part of the term of his sentence"

The counsel for the respondent has no objection to the withdrawal of the appeal but objects to

the backdating of the sentence.

Section 323(5} of the Code of Criminal Procedure is applicable to "such appellant" as stated in

the said section. However, the definition as to who "such appellant" may be is stated in section

323(4} as quoted below:

"When a person sentenced to a term of rigorous imprisonment has preferred an appeal, but is unable to give the required recognizance or other security he shall be detained in custody without hard labour until the judgment of the court of appeal is made known to the superintendent of the prison."

The appellant in this case has been imposed with a death penalty which has no fixed term of

imprisonment as he is merely kept in custody awaiting his execution. The sections 285(1} states

that the day and the place for the execution of a death sentence will be decided by the

president. Therefore, the Court of Appeal shall not disregard the words of the section and

attempt to backdate the sentence.

The Cases submitted by the counsel for the appellant namely S.C.Spl.L.A. No.14/2002, CA No.

135/96, CA No.40/98 and CA No. 106/92 shall not be considered as the accused appellants in

the above mentioned cases have been imposed with life imprisonment and thus does not

support the submission of the defense.

Further in cases of CA 114-117/2000, 127/2001 and 27-29/2001, learned judges of the Court of

Appeal have allowed the withdrawal of the appeal in terms of sec. 359 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, but not acted under Sec.323(5) of the said act. There is no basis to act under

section 323(5) of the said act in a death sentence case since a sentence of death cannot be

backdated.

After considering the submissions made on behalf of the accused appellant, we allow the

application of the counsel for the accused appellant to withdraw the appeal and disallow the

application made under section 323(5) Code of Criminal Procedure Act to backdate the death

penalty.

The appeal stands dismissed.
