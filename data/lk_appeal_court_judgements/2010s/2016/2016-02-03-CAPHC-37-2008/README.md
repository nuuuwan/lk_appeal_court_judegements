P.R. Walgama, J

This appeal is arising out of the order dated 9th January 2008, for

allowing the application of the Petitioner - Respondents, for the

Issuance of a Writ of Certiorari and for a Writ of Prohibition

against the Respondent - Appellants.

The Petitioner- Respondents made an application for mandate in the

nature of Certiorari and Prohibition under Article 154 P (4 ) (b) of

the Constitution.

In the above application the Petitioner- Respondents had urged thus;

F or a stay order against the 1 st and the 2nd Respondents for doing

any activity In the Petitioners lands till the conclusion of this

application.

For a writ of Certiorari quashing the 2nd RespondenCs order of

acqumng the petitioners lands described in the schedule to the

petition.

F or a writ of Prohibition to stop all further activities which are to

be taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents regarding the lands

described in the schedules to the petition.

The facts in appeal as stated in the petition, albeit brief, are as

follows;

That the 1 st and the 2nd Petitioner- Respondents are husband and

wife and were the owners of the lands described in the schedules

to the petition.

The 2nd Respondent being the Minister of lands ordered the 1 st

Respondent - Appellant to acqUIre the lands described In the

schedules to the Petition.

That the Petitioner- Respondents became entitled to the afore said

lands by virtue of Deeds marked as Pl,P2 and P3. Due to the

ethnic conflict prevailed in the North and East the Petitioners were

removed to a refugee camp.

In the year 2005 In November on the direction of the 1st

Respondent some of his agents had entered the disputed land and

wanted them to vacate the premises as they were to survey the

said property.

It is the position of the Respondent -Appellant that the said plot

of land has been acquired by the State by way of a gazette

notification. It IS been noted that the said gazette was not before

this court at the time of the argument. But at a latter stage it was

produced by the counsel for the Respondent - Appellant, subject to

the objections of the Petitioner- Respondents.

It is pertinent to mention at this juncture that the gazette

notification which was produce at a later stage and marked as

1 Rl does not refer to the disputed land and as such the said

document has to be rejected.

In addition to the afore said it IS also noted that Glt :ri.l:~pU1tJl:{lt

- Appellant by way of objection have stated that the after

acqUIrIng the land In Issue the 2nd Respondent - Appellant has

handed over to the 1 st Respondent by letter dated 07.11.2001 which

is marked as 1 R1. But the Respondent - Appellant had failed to

produce the said document up to date. Therefore this Court will

not be able to decide whether the subject land IS vested with the

State or not. The burden of proVIng the land IS vested with the

State IS with the Respondent - Appellant.

In the attended circumstances it IS abundantly clear that the

Respondent - Appellants had failed to established that the Land In

dispute IS a State Land and therefore this Court is compelled

to arrIve at the irresistible conclusion that the Article 154(p)( 4)

of the Constitution will be applicable as the subject land is

not a State Land.

the Respondent-

Appellants filed a statement of objections, and stated thus:

By way of a preliminary objection, the Respondent - Appellants

had taken up the position that the High Court of Eastern

Province, Holden at Batticalo has no jurisdiction to issue a writ

of Certiorari and a Prohibition against the 1 sl and the 2nd

Respondents - Appellants.

The Respondent - Appellants had recourse to the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution, Article 154P 4(b)(1)(2), every such

High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue according to law,

Therefore it IS said that the Acquisition of property IS

excluded from the Provincial Council list. Hence it IS trite that

the High Court of Province has no jurisdiction to hear and

make a determination on any matter where the State Land is in

Issue.

It is also the position of the Respondent - Appellants that the

subject land was acquired for the purpose of building houses for

the people who was displaced by Tsunami.

It is alleged by the Respondent - Appellants that the Petitioner-

Respondents are guilty of laches, as the Petitioner - Respondent has

made the instant application on 24.10.2007, whereas the

possesslOn was obtained in 07/11.2005. But as I have mentioned

above the Respondent - Appellants have failed to prove the subject

land IS a State.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts

placed before Court, arrived at the conclusion that the High

Court of Province IS empowered to determine any matter relating

to 'lands'.

It is against the said order the Respondent - Appellants made the

instant application to have the said order set asidel vacate.

It IS the categorical position of the Respondent - Appellants that

the subject land IS a state land and by virtue of the Gazette

marked as IVI the disputed land has been vested with the

State.

But nevertheless as it IS stated herein before the Gazette

Notification, marked as RIR has no relevance to the Land In

Issue.

It is pertinent to advert to Item 18 of the Provincial Council's

list(listl- 9th schedule)

accordance with the laws governing the matter.

Therefore it is abundantly clear that the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution had given a vivid interpretation of the powers of the

Provincial Council where the matters relating to the 'State Land' is

concerned.

In the case of BULANKULAMA AND OTHERS .VS. SECRETARY

OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMEMT AND OTHERS (2000) 3 Sri. L.R.-

243-, has recognised the concept of disposition or alienation of the

State Lands is with the Centre and the Provincial High Court will

have no power to determine any matter relevant to the said

subject.

As the Respondent - Appellants had mainly relied on the strength

of the above stated factual and legal matrix, I am of the view it

is apposite to advert to the said legal position too.

In the recent judgment of SOLAIMUTHTHU RASU .VS.

SUPRINTENDENT SAMITHIY A & OTHERS - SC APPEAL- 2112013

has affirmed the above position to vit that the subject of

State Land IS not a devolved subject, which comes within

the ambit of the Provincial Council, but strictly with the

Centre.
