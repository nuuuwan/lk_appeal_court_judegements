CASE- NO- CA (PHC) 118-2010- JUDGMENT- 01.08.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The Petitioner- Appellant (in short the Appellant) has

preferred the instant appeal to impugned the order of

the Learned High Court Judge dated 16.11.2010.

It is to be noted that on the date of argument the

Petitioner-Appellant was absent and unrepresented,

although the notices were served on him and the

Registered Attorney. Therefore this Court had the

opportunity of hearing the argument of the Counsel

only for the Respondents.

The facts germane to the instant application

emanates thus;

The Divisional Secretary of Madagama instituted action

In the Magistrate Courts of Monaragala for an

ejectment order In terms of State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979, amended by Act

Nos. 29 of 1983, 50 of 1987, and 29 of 1997.

In the said case the said Competent Authority has

moved for an order of ejectment of the Respondent

as he was In an unauthorised occupation of the

State Land.

Pursuant

to the above application the Learned

by his order dated 04.06.2009, had ejected

the Respondent and everybody holding under him,

acting in terms Section 10 of the said Act.

It is also considered in the said order that as per

Section 9 of the said Act the burden IS shifted to

The Learned Magistrate has also considered the

objection taken by the Respondent of the fact that

the affidavit tendered by the Plaintiff and had arrived

at the conclusion that the said affidavit IS In

accordance with the necessary requirements and had

rejected the said objection thereto.

In the above setting the Learned Magistrate has

arrived at the determination to Issue an ejectment

order to eject the Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Responden t-

Petitioner had come by way Revision to have the

said impugned order set aside.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the

facts placed before him, was of the VIew that the

Learned Magistrate has made the above order In the

correct perspective, and had upheld the same.

The instant appeal lies against the said order of the

Learned High Court Judge and the above order IS

assailed on the following grounds;

That the Affidavit accompanying the above application

for ejectment was not In accordance with the law

and as it does not disclose the religion of the

Affirmant. In the above setting the Appellant moves

that the application for ejectment should be dismissed

in limine.

But it IS the contention of the Respondent that as

per amendment to the State Land Recovery of

Possession Act only insists to mention the place at

which the Affidavit is signed and not the religion of

the Affirmant.

The said requirement as a necessary element to be

embodied was gIVen mind to by Their Lordships In

the case of TRICO FREIGHTS (PVT) LTD .VS. YANG

CIVIL ENGINEERING LANKA PVT LTD 2000 2 SLR 136

wqhich has been observed thus;

" therefore it IS my vIew that an affirmation IS not

bad In law merely because the deponent has made

an affirmation without stating that he IS a

Buddhist, Hindu, or Muslim".

Further the said rationale was recognised and

appreciated In the cases of MOHOMED FACY .VS

MOHAMED AZATH SANOON AND OTHERS (case no.

4

4/2004( BASL law Journal 2006) and in the case of

SENOK TRADE COMBINE LTD .VS. K.H.S. PUSHAPADEVI

(decided on 04.09.2014) was in agreement of the

above observation of the afore said case.

Therefore in the above setting this court will not up

hold the objection of the Respondent- Petitioner-

Appellant, and dismiss the appeal.

Therefore the appeal is dismissed accordingly.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
