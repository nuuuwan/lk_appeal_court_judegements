g) Grant and issue a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent and/or any other

When this matter was supported before this court on 08.12.2008 Respondents undertook not to

forward the recommendation of the 1st Respondent to the President until the conclusion of these

proceedings.

The Petitioner who was enlisted to the Cadet Corps of the Sri Lanka Army (volunteers) on 20.04.1980

and was commissioned to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1983. Since then he was given promotions in

the Army, and at the time the impugned conclusion was arrived by the 1st Respondent he was holding

the rank of Temporary Lieutenant Colonel.

The Petitioner's position before this court was that until he received a notice along with a complaint

(dated 14.10.2003) from the Human Rights Commission, he was unaware of any incident between him

and a soldier by the name of Samantha Ranasinghe, but in fact he had considered a Redress of

Grievance of the said Soldier which was submitted to him through the 5th Respondent and

consequently he had granted approval to the same.

, <

Consequent to the said complaint from the wife of the said Soldier Samantha Ranasinghe to the

Human Rights Commission, initial investigation was conducted by the Sri Lanka Military Police and

Petitioner too had given a statement in the said investigation.

In June 2006 a Court of Inquiry (here in after referred to as COl) consist of 2nd to 4th Respondents was

appointed to look in to the said allegation.

The complaint of the petitioner before this court is twofold. Firstly the Petitioner alleges that the COl

was biased towards him. Secondly he took up the position that the 1st Respondent does not have the

power to recommend that the Petitioner be called upon to resign his commission.

Before looking in to the said complaint, this court intends to consider the COl conducted to look in to

the allegations as referred to above.

The proceedings of the said COl are before us produced marked R-l by the Respondent. When

perusing R-I this court observed that the purpose of the said COl is to" O)l~C)@ 8J6(Jj(5) ~oG.()()c5

(J~. 60 ~ eJO CJ~C) q l63 q~(O)Q)) ORll~O (0)(J) Rll@'"

It is further observed by this court that at the said COl several witnesses were summoned, sometimes

they were confronted with other witnesses to obtain clarifications, witnesses were permitted to

question other witnesses but there was no accused person or a person who was accused of or charge

sheeted before the COl during proceedings of the COL This position is further confirmed when going

through the findings of the said COL In the said finding COl has made several findings with regard to

soldier Samantha Ranasinghe and also made recommendation with regard to his future in the Sri

Lanka Army.

5

As observed by us there are several other findings in the said COl as against the Petitioner and also

against the 51h Respondent as well. In conclusion the COl has made several specific findings which

appear in paragraph 31-38 of the findings to the COL

As against the Petitioner the COl has reached the following specific findings.

37 the petitioner has served too long in the same unit and therefore he should be transfered

out from his unit

38 to take disciplinary action against the Petitioner considering the findings at paragraphs

24,27,28,29 and 30

It was admitted by both parties that no disciplinary action was held under the terms of the Army Act as

recommended by COl but instead the 151 Respondent had decided to withdraw the commission of the

Petitioner as evinced in the impugned document marked P-lO.

In this regard the Petitioner has argued that the COl had been introduced by Army Court of Inquiry

Regulation 1952 which mainly proceeds with the terms of reference issued with regard to the

allegation against the officer/officers concerned, but COl has no jurisdiction to charge or punish a

person subject to Military Law since there is no charge and a accused person before the COL

Based on the above argument the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that P-lO contemplates

a punishment without following the proper procedure identified in the Army Act,

Regulation 2 of the Army Courts of Inquiry Regulations 1952 reads thus,

"Court of Inquiry means an assembly of officers, or, of one or more officers together with one

or more warrant or non- commissioned officers, directed to collect and record evidence and, if

so required, to report or make a decision with regard to any matter or thing which may be

referred to them for inquiry under this regulation

6

Regulation 162 of the said regulation reads thus,

"Every Court of Inquiry shall record the evidence given before it, and at the end of the

proceedings it shall record its findings inspect of the matter or matters into which it has

assembled to inquire as required by the convening authority"

Section 40 of the Army Act identifies the available cause of action when a person subject to the

Military Law is accused of an offence and taken into custody,

(I) Take steps for the trial of that person by a Court Martial

(II) Where the person is an officer of a rank below that of Lieutenant-Colonel or is a

warrant officer, refer the case to be delt with summarily by the Commander of the

Army or by such officer not below the rank of Colonel as may thereto be authorized by

the Commander of the Army

(III) Where that person is a soldier other than a warrant officer, deal with the case

summarily.

Based on the above provision taken together with the provisions in section 42/45 read with section 133

the Petitioner submitted that a person subject to the Military Law could only be punished consequent

to a Summary Trial or Court Martial.

In the case of Boniface Perera V. Lt.General Sarath Fonseka and Others CA/Writ Application

705/2007 (CA minutes dated 10.09.2009) Anil Goonaratne J concluded,

"This court having considered the case of either party is of the view that proceeding before a

Court of Inquiry in terms of the Army Act is a preliminary step prior to a proper trial, which is

more or less a fact finding inquiry to collect and record evidence and to submit a report. On

receipt of such Court of Inquiry proceedings or report, the Commander of the Army could

7

decide whether to initiate formal disciplinary proceedings by a Court Martial or Summary Trial

in terms of provisions of the Army Act. Court of Inquiry proceeds on the basis of terms of

reference issued regarding the allegation against the officer concerned. There are no formal

charges framed. Therefore based on the Court of Inquiry proceedings it would not be within

the purview of the 151 respondent to impose any punishment as in the case in hand. It is

essential that the person concerned should be tried on formal charges and no punishment could

be imposed prior to framing formal charges at a legally constituted Court Martial or Summary

Trial. As such any decision to punish based on the Court of Inquiry proceedings would be

illegal and ultra virus the provisions of Army Act."

In the case of Weerasinghe V. Lt.General Sarath Fonseka and Others CA/Writ Application

2148/2005 (CA minutes dated 23.07.2007) the Petitioner has contended that after a Court of Inquiry

the Commander of the Army has directed disciplinary proceedings by way of summary trial but before

the conclusion of the summary trial and without knowing the outcome of the said summary trial

Commander of the Army has directed that an amount of Rs. 706, 963/- be recovered from him and

action be initiated to recommend the withdrawal the commission.

In the said circumstance Sri Skandarajah J held that "for the reasons this court issue a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the Commander in so far as it relates to the recovery of Rs.

706,963/- from the Petitioner and the take action to recommend the withdrawal of the commission of

the Petitioner and to discharge him from the Army.

However in contrary to the said argument, whilst referring to the findings of Jayasinghe (J) in the case

of Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera V. Liyanage and others 2003 (1) Sri LR 331 the Learned Deputy

Solicitor General argued that, under the provisions of section 10 of the Army Act, "Every Officer shall

hold his appointment during the Presidents pleasure" and therefore President is not obliged to institute

8

a fact finding inquiry because it was open to the President to terminate the services of the Petitioner on

the basis that the Petitioner holds office at the pleasure of the President."

It was further argued by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General, that the Petitioner being an officer in

the Volunteer Force, is bound under the provisions of Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer

Reserve) Regulations to the effect that,

"An officer of the Volunteer Force may, at any time during his service be called upon to resign

his commission for reasons, which in the opinion of the President, warrant such action."

This court whilst confirming the powers vested with the President under the Army Act and the

Volunteer Reserve Regulation is of the opinion, that the facts and circumstances of the case in hand

does not refer to powers ofthe President, since the impugned document P-lO is only a decision of the

151 Respondent. Even though the Respondents have argued that P-lO is only a recommendation and not

a decision and therefore there is no decision to quash, I cannot agree with the Learned Counsel's

contention since P-lO carries a decision of the 151 Respondent to recommend the President to withdraw

the commission of the petitioner.

During the argument before this court Learned Deputy Solicitor General further relied on the

following observation by the Court of Appeal in the case of Hulangamuwa V. Balthazar 1984 (II) Sri

LR 29 to the effect;

"A consideration of these regulations in particular the procedure prescribed there in and the

duties and functions of the Court of Inquiry, reveals that it possesses all the attributes of a

judicial tribunal. It bears a judicial character. In my view a Court of Inquiry is a tribunal that is

sanctioned and recognized by law and is clothed with all the attributes and incidents of a Court

of Justice. It is one which exercises jurisdiction over persons subject to the Military Law."

9

However it is observed by this court that the circumstances, under which the Court of Appeal made the

said observation, cannot be considered in the present case. In the said case, the decision of the Army

Commander based on the findings of a COl was challenged in the District Court by wayan action for

damages. In the said circumstance Court of Appeal held;

"The complaint (P9) is one which could have lawfully been made to and entertained by the

Commander of the Army. The Court of Inquiry assembled by the Army Commander is one

which exercises jurisdiction over persons subject to military law. The complaint (P9) is one

made by one military officer against another military officer regarding a matter of military

discipline. It relates to a matter which falls within the exclusive cognizance of a military

tribunal. A Civil Court is not competent to inquire into the truth or falsity of such a complaint

and no action in tort can be based there of in a Civil Court. The present action is misconceived

and cannot be maintained in law."

When considering the material discussed above, this court is of the view that the decision contained in

P-lO is illegal and no valid decision in law. Therefore this court decides to issue a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision contained in P-lO as prayed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition.

Petitioner has further argued that the said COl was biased against him. Even though the petitioner has

submitted that, he was unaware of the complaint made by the wife of the Soldier Samantha

Ranasinghe until it was referred to him, the proceedings of the COl which is before us clearly

indicates the circumstances under which the said complaint was made at the Human Rights

Commission. At one instance, when the Petitioner complaint to the COl that he was not given an

opportunity to cross examine the witness, the COl has given an opportunity to the Petitioner to cross

examine witnesses. Therefore this court cannot agree with the Petitioner with regard to his argument.

It is further observed by this court that the Petitioner has failed to establish that he has a legal right to

be promoted and the Respondents are under a legal duty to grant the promotions to him.

10

As observed by this court it is only under section 42/45 read with section 133 of the Army Act, that a

person subject to the military law could only be punished consequent to a Summary Trial or Court

Martial. When the findings of the COl with a recommendation for disciplinary action are submits

before the Commander of the Army he has to take a decision under the provisions of the Army Act.

Therefore this court is not inclined to make any order directing the Commander, not to follow the

proper procedure laid down in the Army Act.

For the reasons setout above this court is not inclined to grant relief as prayed in paragraph (d) - (g) of

the prayer to the Petition.

Under these circumstances this court makes order issuing a Writ o/Certiorari as prayed is paragraphs

(b) and ( c) to the Petition.

Court is not inclined to issue a Writ o/Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition as prayed in paragraphs

(d) - (g) to the Petition.

Application is partly allowed.
