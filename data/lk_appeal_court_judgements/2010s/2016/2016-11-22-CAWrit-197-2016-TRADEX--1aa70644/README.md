CA 197/2016 WRIT APPLICATION

Before Vijith K. MAlalqoda, P.C.J. (P/CA)

P. Padman Surasena, J.

Counsel K.M. Basheer Ahamed for Petitioners.

Janak de Silva, SDSG for Respondents

Decided on 27.09.2016

Vijith K. MAlalqoda, P.C.J. (P/CA)

Heard Counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Senior

DSG who is representing the Attorney General.

The two petitioners have come before this Court against an order

made after the Custom's inquiry with regard to the exportation

of tea by petitioners. As revealed before us, the petitioners

had submitted the necessary documentation in order to export

34000Kgs of black tea in two containers, 17000 in each. The

Custom had ceased the said consignment and at the Custom's

inquiry, the two petitioners were found guilty of the two

charges leveled against them. Wi th regard to the first charge,

which was under Sections 12,44 and 57 of the Customs Ordinance,

1

;' !!I I I,I i i,

Inquiring officer has found them guilty for attempting to export

30,050 Kgs of refused tea, and the said quantity was forfeited

and the balance 3950 Kgs of tea which was above ISO 3720 had

been released to the petitioners. Wi th regard to the 2nd Count,

the 2nd Petitioner was imposed a mitigated forfeiture of Rs.

12206062/- under sections 130 and 163 of the Customs Ordinance.

The petitioners have taken up the position that in the two

charges framed against them, the Respondents have not

specifically informed them of the offences they have committed.

However, we observe that the said charges were framed after

recording the evidence of the witnesses including the evidence

of the 2nd petitioner. Before framing the charges the officer

who conducted the inquiry had made his observations with regard

to the matters what was revealed before the inquiry.

As observed by us and the documents before this Court specially

in page 35 and 36 contains a report from the Tea Board where it

is specifically stated that the two containers contained refused

tea. We observe under the provision of schedule (b) of the

Customs Ordinance "No tea shall be exported which is declared by

the principal Director of Customs or by any officers authorized

by him to be, in the opinion of the officer making such

declaration, unfit for export as be adulterated and therefore

likely to damage the reputation of Ceylon tea in foreign

2

markets." As revealed before us the two containers carried two

sets of packaging where one set of packaging carried a running

number and the other set of packaging does not carry a running

number. The packages which were having a running number is

identified as having standard above ISO 3720 and the other

packages contained refused tea.

This clearly shows ~ the intention of the petitioners when

exporting tea for the foreign markets. In response to the

charge framed against the petitioners, the 2nd petitioner had

pleaded as follows:-

"I humbly request you, not to forfeit the tea in question as

this tea can be upgraded and then can be exported with the

approval of the Sri Lanka Tea Board. There are lot of illegal

tea, food exports which we cannot compete with them as we are

carrying out a genuine business. Now the tea market is also

down and we do not have business as before. This is the first

time I am committing this kind of offense. I have paid the all

the taxes and levies for these exports."

It clearly shows that the 2nd petitioner before this court had

admitted his offense and pleaded in mitigation.

In this instance the forfeiture imposed on the 2nd Petitioner is

justified. And therefore, we see no reason to interfere with

3

the findings of the Customs Inquiry which is challenged before

us. Therefore, we see no reason to issue notices at this

juncture.

Notices are refused. No cost is ordered.

I agree.
