In this appeal the appellant among other reliefs is seeking to set aside

the Order of the High Court of Puttalam dated 25/05/2011.

The facts which led to the making of the said Order by the High Court

are as follows:

The First Party Petitioner - Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) initiated proceedings in the Primary Court

Puttalam by filing an affidavit dated 21109/2001. It was averred in his

affidavit that he was in possession of the land called Puliyankulam Waval, in

4

extent of about 21 acres, and that the second party 1 st Respondent -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st Party Respondent - Respondent

- Appellant) and the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent- Respondent entered the land

forcibly on 0610112009 with a group of thugs and dispossessed him. The

Respondent prayed that the Appellant and the others be evicted and that he

be given vacant possession of the said land.

The case for the Appellant was that there was an action bearing No.

22441/071P filed in the Primary Court of Puttalam regarding the same land.

In that action, the Court did not declare as to who is entitled to possession of

the land. Thereafter the appellant instituted a partition action in the District

Court of Puttalam bearing No. 971P on 29/08/2008. However, in that same

action, he has mentioned that he became aware that the land concerned had

been vested in the Land Reform Commission.

Thereafter on 03/03/2008 the Appellant entered into an agreement

with the Petitioner to sell the land in extent 22 acres 3 roods and 33 perches

that included the subject matter of the present case as well. As the latter

failed to pay the balance consideration due to the appellant by 3110312008 as

agreed, the respondent handed over peaceful possession of the land to the

appellant on or about 21.05.2008.

Although notice had been served on the 2nd Respondent - Respondent

he was neither present nor represented in the Primary Court. The learned

Primary Court Judge thereupon decided to treat him as a party who has

defaulted.

In this case the Primary Court was called upon to reach a decision on

the affidavits filed. After considering the contents in those affidavits

Magistrate of Puttalam sitting as Primary Court Judge made order on

~ I I I j I i I 1 I i I I I I I 1

13/05/2009, dismissing the application and ordered that the parties should

maintain peace until the dispute is resolved by a Civil Court.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 13/05/2009, the Respondent

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court in Puttalam and

prayed to set aside the said Order and sought for an order declaring that he is

entitled to possession of the land concerned.

The learned High Court Judge set aside the order made by the learned

Magistrate on 25/03/2011, restoring the Respondent to possession of the

disputed land. This appeal has been preferred against the said judgment of

the High Court.

When this appeal was taken up for argument on 04112/2014, parties

made their oral submissions and moved to file written submissions as well.

Only the Respondent had filed his written submissions. I have carefully

perused the Petition and Affidavits together with all the annexed

documentation filed in the Primary Court. In addition, I have considered

the oral submissions made by both parties and also the written submissions

tendered by the Respondent.

The Counsel for the Appellant in support of his submissions argued

that the learned High Court Judge in her findings has stated that the Primary

Court Judge has not sufficiently looked into the facts of this case.

However, his submission was that there is no basis to mention so and further

submitted that such a thinking cannot be supported. Counsel for the

respondent submitted that there had been no findings by the Primary Court

Judge as to who was in possession of the land at the time of filing the

information as required by section 68( 1) of the Primary Court Procedure

Act. He further submitted that the Primary Court Judge has failed to arrive

at a determination according to law, on the affidavits and documents

6

tendered. Therefore he submitted that the order is bad in law and has no

force or effect before the law.

In an inquiry where the dispute relates to the possession of any land

or part thereof it shall be the duty of the judge of the Primary Court to

determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part thereof on the

date of filing of the information under Section 66 and make order as to who

is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof. But where a forcible

dispossession has taken place within a period of two months immediately

before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he may

make an order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to possession

prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent court.

Thus, the duty of the judge is to ascertain which party was or deemed

to have been in possession on the relevant date, namely, on the date of the

filing of the information under Section 66.

This is an application filed as a private plaint which had been initiated

on a complaint made to the. Police by the respondent alleging that he has

been dispossessed by the Respondent.

Hence the duty of the judge is to determine whether, the Respondent

who had been in possession of the land was dispossessed by the appellant

within a period of two months immediately before the date of filing of the

information. If the Primary Court judge is satisfied that the respondent had

been in possession of the land and he had been forcibly dispossessed within

a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed under Section 66, he should make an order directing

that the party dispossessed be restored to possession.

The order of the learned Primary Court Judge in the present case made

his observations as follows:

" ..... '~""~U::;J ..... \Md .... :;n.'8'cr. ... .Q~,.J . .J .... ~.~

$.)f'31~~l~~ .. ~,.).@:.: ...... v.~~.,J~.wJ

It is admitted by both parties that the learned Primary Court Judge in

his order has totally failed to comply with the imperative requirement of

Section 68 of Primary Courts Procedure Act, in order to make a declaration

as to who was entitled to possession. He has also failed, as required by that

section, to make a determination as to who was in possession of the land on

the date of filing of information under Section 66( 1) (b).

It is seen therefore, that the Primary Court Judge has failed to make a

determination and to make an order in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. Therefore the order of the learned Primary Court

Judge has no validity before the law.

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge had made a finding

that the Respondent was in possession of the land and had been dispossessed

within a period of two months immediately before the date of filing of the

information. On perusal of the. entirety of the judgment, it is apparent that

the learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration the affidavits and

documents filed by both parties and has come to the aforesaid conclusion.

8

Further, I do not see any wrong in the manner in which the learned

High Court Judge has considered the facts and the way in which she has

applied the law in this instance.

F or the aforesaid reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the Order

made by the learned High Court Judge. Therefore I affirm the Order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 25105/2011.

Appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Appeal is dismissed.
