This is an Appeal which has come before this Court, against the

Judgment of the High Court of Kandy, which allowed the application made

to the said High Court to revise the Order of the Primary Court of Nuwara

Eliya, relating to the conviction of the 1st Accused-Petitioner-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

3

The facts that have given rise to the present application are briefly as

follows:

The Complainant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) instituted proceedings in the Magistrate's Court of Nuwara Eliya

against the Respondent and eight others in respect of the commission of an

offence under Section 73 of the Primary Court Procedure Act No.44 of

1979.

Upon a preliminary objection raised by the Respondent and the Others

the learned Primary Court Judge upheld the Preliminary Objection and

dismissed the Appellant's application.

Being aggrieved by the said Order the Appellant sought to move in

Revision against the said Order. The learned High Court Judge after hearing

the parties, made an order directing the learned Primary Court Judge of

Nuwara Eliya to entertain the original application of the Appellant and

proceed to hold the inquiry.

At the Primary Court of Nuwara Eliya, the trial was held against the

Respondents and after trial the learned Primary Court Judge convicted three

Respondents and sentenced them to six (06) months simple imprisonment

suspended for three (03) years and a fine of Rupees Ten thousand

(Rs.l 0,0001-) each.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the Appellant has invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court filing this case and 79/09 and 80109, to intervene

by setting aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Kandy

dated 07.07.2009.

4

Since all three appeals CA (PHC) 78/09), CA (PHC) 79/09 and CA

(PHC) 80109 relate to the same matter and the relief claimed by the

Appellant is identical, by consent of parties all three appeals were

consolidated and heard together.

When these appeals were taken up for argument on 27.05.2015, the

learned President's Counsel for the Respondent raised the following

preliminary objections as to the maintainability of this Appeal.

(i) As an Appeal also had been lodged in the Provincial High

Court of Kandy, and since the learned High Court Judge has

exercised its Appellate jurisdiction, this Court is precluded from

entertaining any application to set aside the impugned

judgment.

(ii) As these are appeals against an acquittal, without the sanction

of the Hon. Attorney General the Appellant could not have

preferred these appeals.

Upon the said preliminary objections parties agreed to file written

submissions.

Firstly, I will consider the first Preliminary Objection namely whether

this Court is precluded from entertaining any application to set aside the

impugned judgment.

In the Written Submissions filed in this Court by the Respondent, it

was contended that, on the Order by the learned High Court Judge dated

07.07.2009, the Appeal (No. 162/2008) and three Revision Applications

(PHC 165/2008, 166/2008 and 167/2008) are referred to and the final order

given on the said date is in respect of the aforementioned Appeal and

5

three (03) Revision Applications. It was further contended that instant

Appeal filed by the Appellant is only in respect of three Revision

Applications and had not appealed against the Appeal decision numbered

162/2008. Therefore, it is the stance of the learned President's Counsel for

the Respondent since the instant appeal filed by the appellant is only in

respect of the three revision applications and had not appealed against the

decision of the appeal Case No. 162/2008, this Court cannot overturn a

judgment which had not been appealed or revision is sought.

But, in the same written submissions filed in this Court (Para 13) it

was contended that, after full hearing of the Appeal and the Revision

applications filed by the Respondents and two others in the Provincial High

Court of Kandy, the learned High Court Judge made an Order dated ih July

2009 in respect of all four cases, whereby the learned High Court Judge set

aside the conviction of the Respondent and two others and acquitted them of

the charge.

Further, it was contended (Para 25) that the Provincial High Court of

Kandy was exercising its special jurisdiction, specifically its revisionary

jurisdiction in the consideration of the revision application filed by the

Respondents along with the Appellate jurisdiction arising out of Provincial

High Court of Kandy (MCA) 162/2008.

Hence, it is an undisputed fact that the three Revision Applications

(PHC 165/2008, PHC 166/2008, PHC 167/2008) and the Appeal (MCA

162/2008) has been taken up for hearing together at the same time on the

agreement of both parties whether it is correct or not. What the Appellant of

the case No. 162/2008 would have done was, to withdraw the said Appeal as

6

the Appellant had no right to appeal since the impugned order being made

by the learned Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya under Part VII of the Primary

Court Procedure Act. The Petitioner (Appellant of Case No. 162/2008) in

his affidavit filed with the Revision Application (H.C.R.A. 165/2008) has

admitted that there is no right of Appeal against the Order of the learned

Magistrate.

The following Order has been made by the learned High Court Judge

when the case No. 165/2008 was taken up for hearing.

Hence, it is the stance of the learned President's Counsel for the

Appellant that the learned High Court Judge of Kandy exercised his

Revisionary Jurisdiction in HCRA 165/2008 and pronounced the judgment.

It is to be noted that, the learned High Court Judge in his Judgment dated

11.05.2009 has stated, he took up for argument HCRA 165/2008, and it was

an application in Revision.

Hence, there is no doubt that the learned High Court Judge has

exercised the Revisionary Jurisdiction and pronounced the Judgment dated

07.07.2009.

Now I will tum to consider, what is the remedy available in law when

a person is dissatisfied with a judgment of the High Court made, exercising

its Revisionary Jurisdiction.

Article 154 P (6) of the Constitution states as follows:

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any person

aggrieved by a final order, judgment or sentence of any such Court, in

the exercise of its jurisdiction under Paragraphs 3 (b) or 3( c) or 4 may

appeal there from to the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article

138".

In the instant case, although the learned High Court Judge had taken

up the Revision Application (No. 165/2008) mainly for hearing, parties have

agreed to abide by the decision of the said matter in respect of other cases.

Hence, I am of the view, since the impugned judgment has been made by the

learned High Court Judge, in exercising his Revisionary Jurisdiction, this

Court is not precluded from entertaining this Appeal.

It is to be noted, that as all the other cases had been taken up for

hearing together, the Appeal case (162/2008) cannot be severed from the

other cases. Hence, I am not agreeable with the submissions made by the

learned President's Counsel for the Respondent, that the learned High Court

Judge of Kandy was in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in giving the

Order.

It is not an arguable matter that any appeal against an Order by a

Provincial High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall lie in

the Supreme Court. However, in the above circumstances this Appeal

cannot be considered as an appeal referred to this Court against a judgment

given by the learned High Court Judge exercising his appellate jurisdiction.

As such I am of the view, this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine

this appeal.

The second preliminary objection is that as this is an appeal against an

acquittal, without the sanction of the Attorney General, the Appellant could

not have preferred this Appeal.

It is the stance of the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant

that, Article 154 P (6) of the Constitution or provisions of the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act does not impose any such restriction.

The learned President's Counsel has contended that restrictions in respect of

appeals to the High Court, are found in Section 318 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The said section reads as follows:

"An Appeal shall not lie from an acquittal by a Magistrate's Court

except at the instance or with the written sanction of the Attorney

General".

Accordingly, Section 318 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that

an appeal shall not lie from an acquittal by a Magistrate's Court except at the

instance or with the written sanction of the Attorney General.

9

It is the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the

Appellant that, restriction does not apply in respect of an Appeal to the

Court of Appeal from the High Court.

In the written submissions filed III this Court on behalf of the

Respondent, it was contended that, an appeal against the order of the

Provincial High Court of Kandy, falls within the ambit of Section 798 of the

Civil Procedure Code and in consequence Section 318 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

Section 798 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Section 798 "An Appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from every

order, sentence or conviction made by any Court in the exercise of its

special jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish by way of

summary procedure the offence of contempt of Court, and of offences

by this Ordinance made punishable as contempt of Court, and the

procedure on any such appeal shall follow the procedure laid down in

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act regulating appeals from orders

made in the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of Magistrate's Courts".

The learned President's Counsel, in support of the above submissions

referred to case of Rubert Appuhamy vs. Kesbewa Pradeshiya Sabawa and

Others (2007) 1 S.L.R. 1. In that case, the accused was charged in the

District Court for Contempt of Court under Section 797 of the Civil

Procedure Code. The accused were acquitted after inquiry. The Appellant,

who is the 3rd defendant and the virtual complainant appealed to have the

order of acquittal set aside. The accused raised the objection that no appeal

shall be lodged against an acquittal except with the written sanction of the

10

Attorney General and as the written consent of the Attorney General has not

been obtained the appeal should be rejected in limine.

The Court held, as the Appellant has failed to confonn to the

requirement of Section 318 of the Code, the Appellant cannot maintain the

appeal.

Section 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

"An Appeal shall not lie from an acquittal by a Magistrate's Court

except at the instance or with the written sanction of the Attorney

General".

In tenns of Section 318 of the Code, an appeal against an acquittal by

a Magistrate's Court can only be preferred by the Attorney General or with

his written sanction.

Hence, it is the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the

Respondent that, this Appeal falls within the ambit of Section 798 of the

Civil Procedure Code and in consequence Section 318 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

It is to be noted, that the case cited in the written submissions (Rubert

Appuhamy vs. Kesbewa Pradeshiya Sabawa and Others) has no relevance to

the question of issue in the instant case. I am of the view it is unrelated to

the question that arises for detennination in this case.

It is relevant to note that, it was an appeal filed in the Court of Appeal,

by the Appellant against an order made by the learned District Judge, with

regard to a charge for Contempt of Court. In the said case the main question

for detennination was, whether the entire Chapter dealing with "appeals"

,

11

from Magistrate's Court would apply or whether it applies in the exclusion

of Section 318, that deals with the requirement of having to obtain the

written sanction of the Attorney General. It was held in the said case,

Section 318 of the Code is incapable of being isolated from Section 798 of

the Civil Procedure Code and should be strictly followed mutatis mutandis

in respect of appeals against acquittals recorded by a District Judge.

Hence, the judicial precedent, relied upon by the Appellant IS

unrelated to the question that arises for determination in this case.

As such, I am of the view that the restriction in respect of appeals to

the High Court found in Section 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,

does not apply in respect of an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the High

Court.

In such circumstances, I overrule the preliminary objections raised by

the learned President's Counsel.
