The 2nd accused was dead at the time of the trial.Therefor the charge against him was

withdrawn by the state counsel and the rest of the charges were also amended accordingly.

The deceased Solamalai Umadevi who was a 23 years old girl used to go to a typing class every

day. On the 1ih of September 2001 she had not returned home after the class. On the

following day early morning her father had gone to the police station and lodged a complaint

about the Umadevi's disappearance.

On that evening her father had informed by the police of a dead body of a woman found near

Mallanda Bridge, which was situated on the way to the deceased's home. The father of the

deceased had identified the body of Umadevi.

There were no eye witnesses to the incident and it was wholly rested on circumstantial

evidence.

The second accused appellant was staying nearby where the dead body was found. The place

where he was living was used as a slaughter house of chicken and it was done outside the

house. According to the neighbour of the second accused appellant he had heard a woman

screaming in the middle of the night on the 12th September 2001 from the second accused

appellant's house. PW2, the owner of the chicken slaughter house has confirmed that on the 1ih of September 2001, the 2nd Accused Appellant was staying in that slaughter house.

During the course of the investigation, the police had found blood stains inside the said house,

which was identified as human blood by the Government analyst.

Witness Wasudevan who was said to have been working under Salam (original 2nd accused who

is now a dead) had heard a conversation between the first accused appellant and Salam

(original 2A). According to the witness the conversation had taken place after few days of the

murder of Solamalai Umadevi. The witness was said to have been visited the shop of the first

accused appellant in order to deliver a message to Salam. Thereby he had overheard a

conversation between the first accused appellant and Salam divulging the fact that both of

them were committing the murder of Umadevi.

4

Investigation revealed that the 2nd accused (who is now dead) had pawned the necklace which

belonged to the deceased (necklace had identified by the father of Umadevi) in the presence of

the 1st accused appellant.

The first accused appellant in his dock statement had pleaded not guilty and further stated that

he knew nothing about the incident. He had also mentioned that witness Wasudeva had left

him saying that his wages were inadequate. Therefore he had an animosity with the first

accused appellant.

The second accused appellant also has denied the allegation against him and he had further

mentioned that the blood stains which were found to be in the slaughtering house where he

was living, was belonged to a kind of insects (~OI@&G'c..:l:1).

According to witness Pushpalatha (sister of the deceased) it was revealed that on the day of the

incident the deceased had gone to the typing class but never returned home. This particular

class was situated about 2km away from their house (This corroborates the evidence of her

father).She had also identified the diamond cut necklace, which had a broken joint, as worn by

the deceased when she was last seen. Further mentioned that it was not available at the time

when the dead body was found.

Counsel for the first accused appellant submitted that witness Wasudeva is not a reliable

witness and therefore his evidence should not be acted upon according to the following

infirmities:-

1. He had made a statement to the police on 28.11.2012 (after 11 years of the incident)

(vide page 169 of the brief).

2. It was not a voluntary statement since he had given the statement only when the police

came searching for him (vide page 169 and 170 of the brief).

3. He had not divulged about the incident to anyone, even to his father until the police

came and recorded the statement.

4. Wasudeva had an animosity against the first accused appellant (vide pages 172 to 174

of the brief).

5. It was not a probable statement (vide page 164 of the brief)

5

It is also submitted by the counsel that it is very unlikely that two people to discuss about a murder committed by them in the presence of another staying 20 feet, who could hear the dialogue.

It is further submitted that since the original second accused Salam was dead, at the time when the trial was taken up, his utterings cannot be considered as evidence against the first accused appellant.

The evidence led against the first accused appellant is inadmissible in terms of the Evidence Ordinance and it should be rejected.

The pawned necklace which had been recovered from witness Maliappan Sinniah Sundaralingam was said to have been pawned by Salam (the 2nd Accused), after the death of the deceased in the presence of first accused appellant (vide pages 219, 220 of the brief).

According to the evidence of the investigating officer revealed that witness Sinnaiyah Sunderalingam to whom the chain had been pawned was discovered on statements made by both accused (first accused appellant and the 2nd accused-who is now dead) Therefore the counsel for the first accused appellant states that adverse inference cannot be drawn in respect of first accused appellant since second accused was dead at the time of trial. (King v. Sudahamma 26 NLR 220).

The counsel for the first accused appellant further states that even if it was admissible, only inference that could have been drawn against the first accused appellant was that he had the knowledge of the place where Salam (second accused) had pawned the necklace. Therefore that evidence should not have been allowed to be led by the learned High Court Judge.

The counsel for the 1 st Accused Appellant submitted that In King V s Haramanis 48 NLR 403at 404 the court has observed "As a matter of law the prosecution is neither bound to assigned nor prove a motive as to why a criminal act was done ............ But when the facts themselves are not clear and there is also the absence of an intelligible motive theses combined factors may have the effect of creating doubts in favour of the accused"

6

In the present case, one cannot say that the facts are not clear. There is clear circumstantial evidence against both the Accused Appellants which amply demonstrate the culpability of the Accused appellants. Therefor the above mentioned case is not applicable to the present case.

Though the appellants marked few contradictions, but it is evident that, those contradictions do not go to the root of the case. Therefor those contradictions cannot be considered as material contradictions.

The Lucas Dictum holds that a statement made in or out of court that is proved or admitted to be false and can be shown to be motivated by the fear of truth and the realization of guilt, can be taken as corroboration of other incriminating evidence or testimony. The false statements were that when police asked about the blood stains the 2nd accused appellant said that it was belonged to insects. The expert evidence proved that it was human blood. Therefor it is evident that the 2nd

accused appellant gave a false explanation in order to hide his guilt.

Under these circumstances, learned High Court Judge was entitled to draw the necessary inferences and compelling inferences from the circumstances that are from the failure of the 2nd

accused appellant to offer an explanation about blood stains found in the slaughter house where he was residing. Since there is highly incriminating circumstances established the dictum of Lord Ellenborough is applicable to the facts of the instant case. Though the right to silence is applicable in the general rule I would refer to the following dictum of Lord Ellenborough in the Case of Rex Vs Lord Cochrane and others[Gurney's Rep. 479]:-

"No person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct or of circumstances of suspicion; but if he refuse to do so, where a strong prima facie case has been made out, and when it is in his olWl power to offer evidence, if such exist, explanation of such suspicious appearances, which would show them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he re!Tains !Tom doing so only !Tom the conviction that the evidence so suppressed or not adduced would operate adversely to his interest"

In the same vein King Vs Seeder de Silva 42 NLR 337 Howard CJ decided the same.

Also in the case of King Vs Wickremasinghe 42 NLR 313 Moseley S.P.J. stated the same.

Counsel for the accused appellant has submitted that witness Wasudewa had given a belated statement and therefor he is not reliable. In the case of Sumanasena Vs AG 1999 3SLR 137 Court of Appeal decided that" .. , Just because the witness is a belated witness court ought not to reject his testimony on that score alone, court must inquire into the reason for the delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the court could act on the evidence of a belated witness ... "

Considering all above I am of the view that the learned trial judge has very correctly and cautiously considered the evidence and taken a correct decision .I see no merit in this appeal. Therefor I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
