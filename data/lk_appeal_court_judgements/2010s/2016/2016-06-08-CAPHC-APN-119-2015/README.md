This is a revision application against an order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo. The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The

Applicant - Respondent - Petitioner (the Petitioner) instituted action in the

2

Magistrate Court Colombo praying maintenance for her two children and

herself from the Respondent - Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter called

and referred to as the Respondent). The parties entered in to a settlement

at the Magistrate Court in relation to the application for the interim relief.

Later the Respondent filed an application in the Magistrate Court seeking

to set aside the settlement on several grounds, was refused by the learned

Magistrate. The learned Magistrate later made the interim order

permanent. Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent moved in

revision in the High Court of Colombo. The Learned High Court Judge

set aside the order of the learned Magistrate and ordered to calculate the

amount paid as the interim payment and to set off that amount against the

future payments to be paid by the Respondent consequent to a fresh order

for interim payment of maintenance to be made by a Magistrate Court.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner presented this revision

application.

The Petitioner moved to support the application with notice to the

Respondent. At the stage of support, the counsel for the Respondent

raised a preliminary objection on the maintainability of this application.

The objection is as follows;

"The exceptional circumstances have not been averred and there is

other relief available to the Petitioner which the Petitioner has not

exhausted and the revision lies only on the exceptional

circumstances where there is no other remedy available and

already the learned Magistrate has granted the relief in terms of

paragraph "d" of the petition which is the substantive relief that

has been prayedfor in this petition and therefore this application is

misconceived in law and cannot be maintained. "

This objection has several limbs. First limb is that the exceptional

circumstances not averred in the petition. The Petitioner, in the paragraph

3

17 and 18 of the petition, aver the exceptional circumstances. The

Learned High Court Judge's determination to set off the moneys already

paid towards the maintenances of the children for the money to be paid in

future in consequence to an order of the Magistrate is averred as

exceptional circumstances.

The second limb of the objection is that there are other reliefs

available to the Petitioner and has not been exhausted and the revision

lies only on exceptional circumstances where there are no other remedies

available. The revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is not limited to

instances where there is no other remedy available. Even if the right of

appeal is available, the revisionary jurisdiction can be invoked if the

exceptional circumstances exist.

Rustom v. Hapangama & Co. [1978-79J 2 Sri L R 225

(1) The powers by way of revision conferred on the Appellate

Court are very wide and can be exercised whether an appeal has

been taken against an order of the original Court or not. However,

such powers would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances

where an appeal lay and as to what such exceptional

circumstances are is dependent on the facts of each case.

Buddhadasa Kaluarachchi V. Nilamani Wijewickrama and another

[1990J 1 Sri L R 262

(5) The Court of Appeal has the power to act in revision, even

though the procedure by way of appeal is available, in appropriate

cases.

Mallika De Silva V. Gamini De Silva [1999 J 1 Sri L R 85

2. Where the Order of Court is wrong ex facie it would be

quashed by way of revision even though an appeal may lie against

such order.

Assuming for the purpose of argument the appeal is the proper

remedy, a question will arise as to whether a party could invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. The Courts have

held that even in cases where appeal is available if exceptional

circumstances are present Court could act in revision.

Ranjith SAmarasinghe V. k Wilbert CA (PHC) 127/99 CA minutes

28.03.2011

When an alternative remedy is available a party dissatisfied with

an order of a lower Court can invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the superior Court only upon establishment of exceptional

circumstances.

It is the settle law that even if there is an alternative remedy is

available, the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court can be invoked on

exceptional circumstances.

Bank Of Ceylon V Kaleel and others [2004J 1 Sri L R 284

(1) The court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has

given the plaintiff-petitioner an alternative remedy (s. 754(2)) and

when the plaintiff has not shown the existence of exceptional

circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

Per Wimalachandra, J.

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order

challenged must have occasioned a failure of justice and be

manifestly erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or

irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it - the

5

order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked

the conscience of court. "

In the present case the learned High Court Judge ordered to

calculate the payments made so far for the maintenance of children and to

set off them against the future payments to be made in consequence to an

order of the Magistrate Court. This order shocks the conscience of Court.

The payments made were for the maintenances of the two children. The

moneys paid have been utilized for that purpose and now the Court orders

the Petitioner, the Applicant of the maintenance application, to pay them

back. Setting off against future payment is paying them back. Can a

Court make an order to pay back the money paid to her for the

maintenance of her children in a maintenance application? On the face of

the record, exceptional circumstances exist.

The other part of the preliminary objection is that the Magistrate

Court has already made an order and therefore this application cannot be

maintained. As I pointed out earlier, the order of the Learned High Court

Judge was challenged on impracticability that the Petitioner has to pay

back the money spend on the maintenance of the two children.

Under these circumstances, I overrule the preliminary objection

and fix this case for support.

I agree.
