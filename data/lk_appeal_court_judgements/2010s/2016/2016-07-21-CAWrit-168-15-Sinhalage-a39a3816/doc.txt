Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application was the former chairman of the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha. He has come

before this court seeking a writ of Certiorari to quash an order made by the 15t Respondent under section 185 (1)

of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 removing the said Petitioner from the post of chairman and

membership of Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha.

In addition to the 15t Respondent who is the Chief Minister and Minister in Charge of the Subject of Local

Government of the North Central Province, the Petitioner had made as the 2nd Respondent the inquiry officer

appointed by the 15t Respondent under section 185 of the said Act.

The commissioner of Local Government North Central Province, Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha and the

Secretary to the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha had been made as the 3rd,4th and 5th Respondents.

In addition to the above Respondents the Petitioner had made Deputy Chairman and the other member of the

Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha as 6th to 16th Respondents to the application.

However prior to this application was supported before this court, the said Pradeshiya Sabha was dissolved and

thereafter the petitioner had moved court to amend the Caption and support the application. The above

application was made in open court on 27.05.2015 when this matter comes up for support before this court.

Petitioner had filed an amended petition before this court on 26.06.2015 and in the said amended petition only

the 15t to 5th Respondents were added as parties.

When the amended petition was supported before this court on 13.11.2015, the counsel representing the 1st to 5th

Respondents have raised a preliminary objection on the basis that necessary parties to the application (i.e. 6th_16th

Respondents to the original petition) are not before the court and moved that the application be dismissed in

limine.

When the said preliminary objection was raised before this court, parties moved to file written submissions with

regard to the said preliminary objection and the matter went down for written submissions. However prior to the

dead line to file the written submissions, the Petitioner by motion dated 18.11.2015 moved this court to withdraw

the amended caption he has filed on 26.06.2015.

However the said motion was disallowed by this court and the parties have now filed written submissions on the

preliminary objection raised by the 1st to 5th Respondents.

As observed by this court the main matter has not yet been supported before this court and therefore this court is

not interested in going through the merits of this case at this stage. Whilst raising the preliminary objection

before this court, the 1st to 3rd and 4th to 5th Respondents have gone through the facts of this matter to show that

the former members of the Pradeshiya Sabha are necessary parties to the application. Since the petitioner has not

supported the matter before this court, it is premature for this court to take a decision whether the petitioner has

failed to make necessary parties, as Respondents to the amended petition or not.

Therefore this court in not inclined to allow the preliminary objection and dismiss this application in limine at

this moment but decides to consider the said preliminary objection along with the main case when considering

the issuance of notices on the Respondents.

Court decides to fix the main matter for support for notices, subject to considering the above preliminary

objection at that stage.
