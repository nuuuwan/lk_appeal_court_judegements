The petitioner has filed this application praying for a writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the first respondent to discharge the petitioner from the

Army and the decision to recover a sum of Rs. 66,474/= from the petitioner.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted the court of inquiry held

against the petitioner recommended that disciplinary action be taken against

the petitioner under the Army Act, but the first respondent without following the

correct legal procedure dismissed the petitioner. The petitioner stated that he

was a second Lieutenant attached to the second battalion of the Sri Lanka

National Guard serving in the Civil Defence Force when he was dismissed by

the first respondent the Commander of the Army by letter marked P2.

The counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment in CA writ

1765/2006 Urugoda Appluhamilage Ananda Wimalaweera vs Lt.

Gen. Kottegoda, Y BAM Premakumara vs Army Commander and

34 others, CA writ 1153/2006 and Lieutenant Hetti Gamage

Harischandra vs Commander of the Army and 3 others CA writ

895/2007 and said that it had been decided that even the President and

Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces enjoys no unfettered right to

dismiss an officer at his whim and fancy. It was also held in these cases

that the authority of the Army Commander to submit recommendations

for removal or discharge of an officer under regulation 2 (1) (a) of the

Army Officer's Regulations can not be based on the mere opinion formed

on a military police investigation or on facts found by a court of inquiry

and that an officer can be discharged from service only upon conviction

after due trial, in compliance with the rules of natural justice and any

attempt to discharge an officer consequent to a military police

investigation or on recommendation of a court of inquiry is illegal and ultra

vires. The petitioner stated that the respondents acted without

jurisdiction.

The petitioner further submitted that sec. 10 of the Army Act which,

states that every officer shall hold his appointment during the Presidents

pleasure entitled the President to dismiss an officers from the army at his

will is to west such arbitrary and absolute power in the President. The

petitioner cited the judgments in Bandara vs Premachandra 19941 SLR

301, Senasinghe vs Karunathilake 2003 1 SLR 172.

The counsel for the petitioner argued that the order of the first

respondent that the petitioner should be discharged from the SLA (V) F

on account of a disciplinary violation committed by him amounts to a

punishment, which is included in the scale of punishment given under a

court martial. A person can not be punished without a proper hearing and

a charge sheet. The petitioner stated that the first respondent has not

convened a court martial against the petitioner for the offences alleged to

have been committed by him.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that in terms of

Regulation 29 (2) of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer

Reserve) regulations a Lieutenant shall be transferred to the Volunteer

Reserve upon reaching the age of 45 years and the petitioner's transfer

to the Volunteer Reserve was compulsory, under the proviso the said

regulation stated that if an officer has reached the maximum in that rank

his services can be extended by one year at a time up to a maximum of

three years. The respondents stated that the petitioner could have served

for a maximum of three years after reaching the age of 45 years in the

rank of Lieutenant but he has served over seven years when he was

transferred to the Volunteer Reserve in May 2009. The respondents

stated that the petitioner while giving evidence at the court of inquiry has

admitted in evidence that he had reached the maximum in the rank of

Lieutenant. (P 27 of R2a). The respondents stated that in these

circumstances the petitioner was not discharged but transferred to the

Volunteer Reserve.

The petitioner has been commissioned as Lieutenant in the Sri

Lanka Army (Volunteer Force) in July 1997 and he was transferred to the

Volunteer Reserve in May 2003. A court of Inquiry (marked as R2) was

held in April 2008 against the petitioner although the petitioner argued

there was no inquiry held against him. According to the petitioner's own

evidence at the court of Inquiry he was 52 years of age at that time which

shows that he had served 12 years in the rank of Lieutenant when he was

transferred to the Volunteer Reserve.

Regulation 29 (2) of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force

and Volunteer Reserve) regulations reads as;

"An officer shall be transferred to the Volunteer Reserve with the

approval of the President upon his reaching such age as is

specified below as is applicable to his rank:

Rank Age

Lieutenant Colonel and above 57years

Major 55 years

Captain 50 years

Lieutenant/Second Lieutenant 45 years

Provided, however, that the President may, on the

recommendation of the Commander of the Army, if he is of the

opinion that the services of the officer should be so extended in the

interests of the Army, extend by one year at a time but not

exceeding three years, the period of service of an officer in the

Volunteer Force who according to the preceding provisions of this

regulation, has to be transferred to the Volunteer Reserve",

According to the above regulation the petitioner's transfer to the

Volunteer Reserve was compulsory. Petitioner himself giving evidence at

the court of inquiry has admitted that he reached the maximum in his rank

of Lieutenant, and that he was discharged from active service and that

after he appealed to the first respondent he was absorbed to the Civil

Defence Force. the petitioner was not discharged but transferred to the

Volunteer Reserve after reaching the maximum age limit in the rank of

Lieutenant therefore he can not be reappointed to the same position. The

main relief sought by the petitioner in the instant application can not be

granted in view of the afore stated reasons. The application of the

petitioner is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
