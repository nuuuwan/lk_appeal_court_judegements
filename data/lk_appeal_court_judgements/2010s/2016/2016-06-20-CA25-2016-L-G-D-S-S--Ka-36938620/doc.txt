Mahanama de Silva for the Petitioner

Nayomi Kahawita, SC for the Respondent

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C.J. (PICA)

Learned counsel for the petitioner has come before this

court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the impugn

decision P10 and seeking a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting

the learned Magistrate from imposing the decision P10.

When going through the material placed before us by the

counsel for the petitioner, we observe that the impugn

order had been delivered on 17.05.2013. Petitioner has not

taken steps to come before this court once the order was

deli vered by the 6th Respondent. By the time he has come

before this court, the 1st Respondent who is the incumbent

of the 6th Respondent has filed action before the Magistrate

and the Magistrate has already made order enforcing the

findings of the 6th Respondent. We were further informed by

the learned State Counsel who represented the Attorney

General that the petitioners have now appealed against the

said order made by the learned Magistrate to the provincial

High Court. When going through the material, we observe

that the petitioner is guilty of lashes because he had

failed to come before this court in the first instance.

We further observe that the Magistrate has already enforce

the order of the 6th Respondent and therefore, the purpose

of issuing a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the learned

Magistrate from enforcing said PIO will not arise. The

petitioner has gone before the provincial High Court

against the said order of the Magistrate. This fact had

not been revealed by the papers submitted by the

petitioner. We observe that the petitioner is guilty of

concealing material facts before this court as well.

Peti tioner has used an al ternati ve which was available to

him that is by going before the provincial High Court

against the order made by the learned Magistrate. When

considering all these material, we are of the view that

this is not a fit and proper case to issue notices on the

Respondents.
