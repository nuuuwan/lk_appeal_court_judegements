The Appellant in this Appeal has sought to impugn the Judgment of

the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated

19.08.2009, wherein the learned High Court Judge had dismissed the

Petition of the Appellant.

The Appellant had instituted the action No. 95/98 in the High Court of

Embilipitiya, seeking to quash, the letter dated 24.10.2007 marked as 'P 6'

issued by the 1 st Respondent, Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Development, by way of a Writ of Certiorari.

The facts that have given rise to the present application are briefly as

follows:

In respect of the ownership of the paddy field called "Dambagaha

Aswedduma" alias "Dangaha Aswedduma", there was a dispute between

4

the 2nd Respondent -Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd

Respondent) and the 3 rd Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the 3rd Respondent). A case had been instituted by the 3rd Respondent

against the 2nd Respondent in the District Court of Embilipitiya bearing No.

4522. The Judgment was delivered in that case in favour of the 2nd

Respondent declaring that the 2nd Respondent is the owner of the paddy field

in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the 3rd Respondent had

preferred an appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court. In the meantime, the

2nd Respondent made an application for the Writ pending appeal and after an

inquiry, the Court issued the Writ. The Appellant and his wife by way of a

Petition, objected to the Writ being executed evicting the Appellant from the

paddy field in question, on the basis that the Appellant, since 1975 worked

as a Anda Cultivator and he is protected under the Provisions of the Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

At the same time, Appellant made a complaint to the 1 st Respondent,

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development complaining that the 2nd

Respondent is seeking to eject him from the paddy field in question.

The 1 st Respondent by his letter dated 03.10.2007 informed the

Appellant that, though the ownership of the land is changed, the Appellant

could continue as the Anda Cultivator of the paddy field and that the

Appellant could participate at the "Kanna Meetings" of the paddy fields.

However, subsequently, the 1 st Respondent, by his letter dated

24.10.2007 had taken a different position and had informed the Appellant

that, as the District Court of Embilipitiya had granted the possession of the

5

paddy field in question to the 2nd Respondent and also as there is no

reference in that case made in respect of the "Anda Rights" of the Appellant

over the paddy field and since the Court has taken a decision on the matter,

that he suspends the operation of the letter dated 03.10.2007, from which

permISSIOn was granted to the Appellant to cultivate the paddy field in

question.

In these circumstances, the Appellant instituted the present application

in the High Court seeking to quash the said decision of the 1 st Respondent as

the said decision of the 1 st Respondent is contrary to the provisions in the

Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000. The learned High Court Judge by

his order dated 19.08.2009 refused to issue a Writ of Certiorari and

dismissed the Petition.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge the

Appellant has preferred this Appeal.

When this Appeal was taken up for argument on 10.08.2015, after

conclusion of oral submissions by Counsel, parties have tendered their

written submissions and same have been filed.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that it was an

admitted fact that the Appellant was in possession of the paddy field in

question and that he was not a party to the District Court of Embilipitiya

Case bearing No. 45221L. Further contended, when the Appellant became

aware that his tenancy rights over the land are going to be affected the

Appellant had made the complaint referred to in 'P 5'. The learned Counsel

further contended by the said letter 'P 5', the 1 st Respondent had informed

the Appellant that he could continue as the tenant cultivator. It is the stance

6

of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the letter (P 6), sent

subsequently by the 1 st Respondent to the Appellant, suspending the

operation of the letter (P 5) dated 03.10.2007 is contrary to the express

provisions in the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000. The learned

Counsel further contended, that there was a failure of Natural Justice, since

there had been no hearing prior to the decision.

The learned High Court Judge was of the view, that the 1 st Respondent

had taken the decision contained in 'P 5' also ex parte without giving

hearing to the 2nd Respondent. At least, a copy of 'P 5' had not been sent to

the 2nd Respondent.

It is to be noted, the Appellant had not tendered a copy of the letter on

which the 1st Respondent acted upon to issue the letter 'P 5' dated

03.10.2007. The learned High Court Judge had observed, the Appellant's

complaint to the 1 st Respondent is a very vital and material document in

deciding the Appellant's application. However, the Appellant had not

tendered a copy of the said letter when filing the Petition in the High Court.

A Petitioner who seeks relief by way of Writ which is an extraordinary

remedy must in fairness to this Court, bear every material fact so that the

discretion of this Court is not wrongly invoked or exercised. In the instant

case the said letter, is indeed a material fact which has an important bearing

on the question.

In the absence of the said letter a serious doubt arises as to whether

the Appellant had misrepresented the correct facts to the 1 st Respondent. It

is important to note, in 'P 6', the 1 st Respondent has stated that he was

unaware of the execution of the Writ when he issued 'P 6'. It was the

7

contention of the 1 st Respondent, after receiving the letter 'P 5', the 2nd

Respondent informed the 1 st Respondent sending a letter (X) that the 1 st

Respondent by sending 'P 5' has challenged the Court order in the execution

of which peaceful possession of the paddy field was handed over to him by

the fiscal of the Court. Counsel for the 1st Respondent contended, if 'P 6'

was not issued, the 1 st Respondent would have been in contempt of Court

and he had no option but to issue 'P 6'.

In the case at hand I hold that a hearing was not a pre-requisite for

making a recommendation. The 1 st Respondent was entitled to form an

opinion without a prior hearing. He was not legally required to make a

recommendation. It was sufficient for him to form an opinion on the

available materials.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the 1 st Respondent has acted in

proper motive and in good faith.

The granting of a Writ is a matter for the discretion of Court and

Court is bound to take into consideration the consequences which by the

issue of the Writs sought, will entail. A Petitioner seeking a prerogative

Writ is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a

matter of routine.

Halsbury, Volume 11 pages 85 and 86, Simonds Edition:- "The grant

of a Writ is as a general rule, a matter of discretion of the Court. It is not an

order granted as of right and it is not issued as a matter of course.

Accordingly, the Court may refuse the order, not only upon the merits but

8

also by reason of the special circumstances of the case. (Halsbury's Laws of

England).

On perusal of the Judgment, it is apparent that the learned High Court

Judge has taken into consideration the affidavits and documents filed by

parties and had come to his conclusion.

As such, I do not see any wrong in the manner in which the learned

High Court Judge has considered the facts and the way in which he has

applied the law in this instance.

For the above stated reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, I affirm the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated, 19.08.2009. and dismiss

the Appeal with costs.
