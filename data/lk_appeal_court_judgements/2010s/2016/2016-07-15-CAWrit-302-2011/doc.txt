The petitioner has filed this application praying for a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1 st to 17th respondents to appoint

the 18th to 23rd respondents to the Post of Lecturer (Probationary) and to

cancel the interviews held by the University Council in 2009 and 2010.

The petitioner is a graduate of the 1 st respondent university. She

has obtained a first class degree honors and was reading for her M.Phil.

degree in the same University at the time she went for the interview.

The petitioner's counsel stated that she had worked as a visiting

lecturer in year 2009 and 2010 and also served on the examination board.

The petitioner stated that the required hours of lecturing was completed

by the petitioner at the time of the interview. Petitioner has filed

documents P1 to P6 to prove these points.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that posts of

Lecturer (Probationary) Tutor/Instructor and Demonstrator for the

Department of Upcountry Dance of the University of Visual and

Performing Arts were advertised in 2009 and 2010. On both these

occasions after the interviews the interview were cancelled. Documents

P7, P8 and P9 (a) and (b) were produced with the petition to prove these.

Thereafter for the third time the post of Lecturer (Probationary) and

Demonstrator was advertised and the petitioner had applied and was

required to attend a Practical Test which was held on 11/12/2010 and

was asked to come for an interview on the 14th January 2911. (P12 (a)

and (b) and P13). This interview had been cancelled and a fresh interview

was held on 08/02/2011. At this interview the petitioner had been

4

fI

informed that she did not have the one year experience in teaching.

Thereafter petitioner had been informed that she was not selected for the

post advertised.

The petitioner submitted that under circular 935 of the University

Grants Commission the candidate has to make a presentation at the

interview, but the wrongful position of the respondents that the said

circular is not applicable to the interview deprived the petitioner being

selected to the said post. The petitioner stated the circular came into

operation from 01/11/2010 therefore it is applicable to this interview.

The petitioner further submitted that the petitioner was called for

the third interview which shows that she was qualified to be considered

for the said post. The petitioner stated the dishonest conduct of the 2nd

respondent by not sharing the documents submitted by the petitioner with

the other members of the interview panel is evident. The petitioner stated

that the head of the department of upcountry dance had not signed the

mark sheet for the selection of Lecturers to the very department, which

shows the surreptitious manner in which the selections were made.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the

petitioner applied for three different posts namely Lecturer (Probationary)

5

,

1

Tutor and Demonstrator and that the 1 st respondent University never

advertised the post of Tutor, and that no such post existed. The

respondents stated that the petitioner failed to show basic diligence in

instituting this application. The grievance of the petitioner is that she was

refused admission to a post which was not advertised and does not exist.

Therefore the instant application should be dismissed for failure to pursue

this application for discretionary relief with the required diligence the

respondents argued.

The respondents stated that the practical test for the post of

Demonstrator in the Upcountry Dance Department was cancelled after it

had transpired that the Instructor for Percussion Music could perform the

function of the Demonstrator of Upcountry Dance and that there was no

need to recruit a separate Demonstrator. The respondents stated there

were many other applicants in addition to the petitioner for this post. The

respondents argued that they had valid reasons to cancel the earlier

interview and that the petitioner was not the only applicant.

The respondents submitted that the interview board consisted of

five members whose evaluation of her was consistent, and the highest

mark obtained by the petitioner is 76 and the lowest 64 and her marks

should be compared with the marks awarded to the person ranked first.

6

The respondents stated that simple arithmetic will show that the petitioner

has not been deprived of anything she was entitled to. The respondents

further submitted that the petitioner has made vague, frivolous and

unsubstantiated allegations against her examiners who had a wide

discretion in their evaluation, and that the petitioner's allegations are

bereft of merit.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that Circular

no. 721 with respect to recruitment of Lecturer (Probationary) required at

least one year experience in teaching within an institutional frame work

and not stints as a visiting Lecturer, and that the petitioner in her inability

to meet this criterion had adverted to Circular no. 935 where this

requirement had been relaxed.

The respondents stated as can be seen by P10 the advertisement

was before this circular came into operation therefor at the time of

advertising circular no. 721 was in operation. The University Grants

Commission has taken a decision on this on 04/12/2010 before the

interviews were concluded.

The respondents stated that the petitioner's application for the post

of Lecturer (Probationary) was rejected as she did not fulfill the

7

! f

requirements and as circular no. 935 was not applicable to her application

the question of being appointed as a Temporary Lecture does not arise.

The respondents further stated that the petitioner has failed to

comply with the requirements of Rule 3 (1) of the Court of Appeal rules.

The respondents stated that the documents annexed to the petition

marked P1 to P21 are not original or certified copies, and that they are

not individually authenticated. The respondents cited the judgments in

Perera vs Perera 2001 3 SLR 30 and Shanmugavadivu vs Kulathilake

2003 1 SLR 215 and said noncompliance of rule 3 (1) (a) and (b) are

imperative and that the Court of Appeal had no discretion to excuse the

failure of the petitioner to comply with the rules.

The petitioner has submitted that the selection procedure for the

posts she applied for has been done unlawfully and in an unreasonable

manner and alleged that the 2nd prevented her from being selected. The

petitioner made personal allegations against the 2nd respondent without

any evidence to prove them. This is not very professional and is a very

serious allegation to make against a senior Academic. This kind of

frivolous allegations should not be made where there is no material

before court to establish them.

8

On perusal of the marking sheets of the various interview it is clear

that the petitioner did not merit selection. The candidates selected have

obtained higher marks than the petitioner. The petitioner knowing very

well that she did not reach the required marks tried to mislead court by

making allegations against the respondents. The cancellation of the

interviews have been explained by the respondents.

The circular applicable to the petitioner is circular no. 721 and no.

935 therefore the petitioner being appointed as a Temporary Lecturer

does not arise. The petitioner has failed to comply with rule 3 (1) of the

Court of Appeal rules by not providing original or certified documents with

the petition.

For the afore stated reason this court decides to dismiss the

application of the petitioner with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
