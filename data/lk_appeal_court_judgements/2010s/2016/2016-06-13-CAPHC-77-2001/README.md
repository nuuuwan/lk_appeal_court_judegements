P.R.Walgama, J

The Petitioner- Appellants had preferred the instant

appeals bearing No. 77/2001, 78/2001, 79/2001 and

had impugned the judgment of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 22/ 12/2000, for dismissing the

applications for a mandate in the nature of writs of

Certiorari to quash the Awards of the Arbitrators.

The said application of the Petitioner- Appellants had

attracted the Learned High Court .. Judge .. ' on tht='

following details;

The Petitioner - Appellants by the afore said application

moved court to set aside the order of the 2nd

Respondent the Commissioner made on 17.02.1997

and the arbitral award made by the ArbItrator on

04.08. 1995.

The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

22.12 2000 has dismissed the Petitioners applications

on the basis that as per Section 58(5) of the Co

operative Societies Act, the decision of the Registrar

IS final and conclusive and cannot be questioned in

a Court of law and further more that the PetItIoners

although had challenged the appointment of the

Arbitrator, had In fact had appeared bef,ore the

Arbitrator and had placed their gnevances.

Being aggrieved by the said order of

High Court Judge, the petitioners had

this Court to have the said impugned order set

aside.

The following facts had emerged from the petition of

appeal;

That the 1st ,2nd and the 3rd Petitioner - Appellants

had held office In the 1 st Respondent Society namely

the Agalawatta Multipurpose Co- operative Society Ltd,

as the President, Acting General Manager, and as the

Acting Accountant.

As per Section 46( 1) of the said Act the 3rd

Respondent engaged him self to investigate the

activities of the said Society and while the said

process was gOIng on

Commissioner has appoin ted

6th 7th , ,

Respondent

and 8th

Respondents as Directors of the said Society, and

had ouster the 1st Petitioner- Appellant, and appointed

the 6 th Respondent as the President of the said

Society.

Thereupon the Minister concerned had appointed a board compnsIng 7th ,9th and

authority, of the 1st Respondent.

10th as competent

3

Consequently the said Competent Authority by their

letter dated 11.02.94 had demanded a sum of Rs.

137,843, being the alleged loss to the 1st Respondent

Society by purchasing an unauthorised stock of chillies

which has been sold at a pnce less than the

purchased pnce.

It IS the contention of the Petitioner - Appellants that

after the emergency was lifted the appointment of the

Competent Authority became functus and as a result

the appellants had resumed their office as they held

In the 1st Respondent Society.

It IS alleged by the Petitioner - Appellants that the 1st

Respondent Society had held a meeting on 09.07.1994

and had taken the decision to remove the 1 st

Petitioner- Appellant and others from the office In

which they held.

The 3 rd Respondent acting In the capacity as the

Arbitrator has summoned the Petitioner -Appellants in

terms of the above Act to inquire In to the alleged

loss of Rs. 137,843/ by selling the stock Qfchillies.

After the inquiry the Petitioner - Appellants were found

liable for the payment of the said amount.

Being aggrieved by

Petitioner - Appellants

the

had

said determination, the

appealed to the

Respondent - Commissioner against the said finding and

the 2nd Respondent - Commissioner dismissed the appeal

4

and upheld the order of the Arbitrator without gIvIng

his reasons in doing so.

Therefore it IS alleged by the Petitioner - Appellants

that the 2nd Respondent has acted In a manner

contrary to the Section 62 (c) of the Co operative

Societies law.

It IS the contention of the Petitioner - Appellants that

In the circumstances it was prudent to sell the

stock of chillies to the pnce that was sold.

It IS contended by the Petitioner - Appellants that the

appeal should be allowed on the following grounds;

That the reference to arbitration IS bad In law

SInce it has been effected by the 3rd Respondent,

where as the 2nd Respondent IS the author.i~y. vested

with such powers.

Further the Petitioners assail the finding of the

Arbitrator and the 2nd Respondent - Commissioner on

the premlS that no reasons had been adduced for

the said determination.

Besides it is alleged that the Minister concerned has

acted in violation of the principles of Natural Justice.

Hence In the above context it IS contended by the

Petitioner - Appellants that the Respondents had acted

In an arbitrary and illegal manner, and therefore the

decision marked PIO and Pl4 should be set aside.

I t IS to be noted that the Learned High Court

Judge has held that the decision of the

Respondent IS final and Therefore it IS ostensible

5

that the objection taken by the appellants that the

2nd Respondent has not gIven reasons IS of no weight

In this matter, and as such same shall be rejected.

It IS viewed from page 215 of the brief that the

Arbitrator has pronounced the judgment on 04.08.1995,

stating that, his VIews, reasons, and the determinations

are embodied In the judgment. The proceedings before

the Arbitrator IS marked as PIO. But nevertheless the

said impugned judgment of the Arbitrator is In page

148 of the brief and therefore the argument set

forth by the Petitioner - Appellants is devoid of merits

and should stand rejected.

The Petitioner - Appellants adverted court to Section

58(2) of the Co operative Societies Law No. 5 of

1972, which states thus;

58(2) "the Registrar may, on the receipt of a

reference under subsection (1)

a. Decide the dispute himself, or

b. Refer it for disposal to an arbItrator or

arbitrators"

Therefore it is said that the 2nd Respondent Registrar

was vested with the power to refer any matter to

the arbitrator.

But it is alleged by the Petitioner- Appellants that the

instant matter it was not the 2nd Respondent-

Registrar -Commissioner, who had appointed the

Arbitrator but the Responden t who IS the

Assistant Commissioner of Co operative Development has

6

appointed the arbitrator. Therefore it IS contended by

the Petitioner - Appellants that the appointment of the

Arbitrator bad in law.

Hence it IS contended by the Petitioner - Appellants

that the 2nd Respondent could have not delegated his

powers to 3rd Respondent who was the Assistant

Commissioner of Co operative Development.

But it IS the position of the Respondents that In

terms of Section 2 of the Co operative Societies Act

the Minister concerned IS empowered to make the

appointment of persons to act as Registrars.

1 ......... .

2 ........... .

3 .......... .

4. Each of persons appointed to assist the

Commissioner of Co operative Developmen t shall

have and may exerCIse such of powers of the

Registrar under this law and under any rules

made or deemed to be made there under as

may be specified by the Minister In any general

or special order made under this GcctioD..

Therefore it IS contended by the Respond_~:pts that

the Assistant Commissioner IS duly empowered to

Issue the document P9. Further it is stated by the

Respondents that the Petitioners never challenged P9

In the High Court on the basis that the Assistant

Commissioner did not have powers to issue --the said

document.

7

Further it IS alleged by the Respondents that the

Petitioner - Appellants did not have any objection for

the arbitrator conducting the inquiry.

As a comprehensive response to the Issue raised by

the Petitioner - Appellants as to the failure of the

Arbitrator to adduce reasons for

IS stated that In certain cases

the Superior Courts

not mandatory to

adduce reasons, provided that the decision IS made

after holding a fair inquiry. It was thus held in the

case of SAMALANKA LTD .VS. WEERAKOON- 1994 1 SLR-

17.

Further the Counsel for the Respondents has adverted

Court to the case of YASSEN OMAR .VS. _ PAKISTAN

INTERNATIONAL AIR LINES-1999- B2 SLR-375 HAS

EXPRESSED THUS;

"Neither the Common law nor principles of Natural

Justice reqUIre as a general rule that administrative

tribunals or authorities should gIve reasons -'for their

decisions that are subject to judicial review."

Therefore In the above context it IS apparent that

necessity to adduce reasons for the determina.tion of

the Arbitrator's is not mandatory In the light of the

judicial interpretation given by the above case.

The Respondents In answenng the Issue as to the

failure to deposit the 100/0 of the aw-ard as a

precondition to the filing of appeal In terms of Rule

8

49 (XII)(b) of the Rules made under the Corporative

Societies Act, state thus;

To fortify the legality of the above rule the counsel

for the Respondents draws the attention of Court to

the case of SOMARATNE .VS. COMMISSIONER OF CO

OPERATIVES -SC Appeal 58/80 - which held thus;

"in the present instance section 58(3) of law 5 of

1972 gIves the Minister the power to regulate an

appeal within such period and In such manner as

may be prescribed by rules. This section read with

Section 61 (2) of the same law entitles the Minister

to frame rules by which he may,

"Prescribed forms to be used, the fees to be

paid, the procedure to be observed and all other

matters connected with or incidental to the

presentation, hearing and disposal of appeals under

this law or rules made there under".

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the Minister's

act under the above rule IS not ultra VIres, and

rule was recognised In the case of CA Application

No. 889/2000 and further held that the depositing of

security is a

In addition if this Court IS to be the

rational embodied In the case of SEBASTIAN

FERNANDO. VS. KATANA MULTI PURPOSE CO":OPRATIVE

SOCIETY LTD- 1990 1 SLR 342, it IS worthy to

9

mention that the Issue of ultra VIres was never

considered in the above casc.

In the above circumstances it IS apparent that the

Petitioner - Appellants application is unmeritorious and

should stand dismissed.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed
