Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The 2nd Accused - Petitioner was indicted along with one other

accused before the High Court of Kandy, alleging that they have committed

the following offences:-

(l)Between the 25th of June 2011 and 18th of August 2011, in Kandy,

committed the offence punishable in terms of Section 453 read

with Section 113 Band 102 of the Penal Code by conspiring to

prepare forged documents in respect of a land called Kadirana

Estate, for the purpose of cheating.

(2)On or about the 25th of June 2011, within the course of the same

transaction and in Kandy, committed the offence punishable under

Section 456 of the Penal Code by placing your signature to a deed

3

of transfer bearing No. 2651, attested by J.C. Wijetunga, Notary

Public, being a valuable security knowing that the said deed had

not been signed by the persons named Lillian Victoria de Silva

Amarasekara Jayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe.

(3) On or about the 9th of August 2011, within the course of the same

transaction and in Kandy, committed the offence punishable under

Section 456 of the Penal Code, placing your signature to a deed of

transfer bearing No. 3004, attested by J.C. Wijetunga, Notary

Public, being a valuable security knowing that the said deed had

not been signed by the persons named Lillian Victoria de Silva

Amarasekara J ayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe.

(4) On or about the 18th of August 2011, within the course of the same

transaction and in Kandy, committed the offence punishable under

Section 456 of the Penal Code, by placing your signature to a deed

of transfer bearing No. 3012, attested by J.C. Wijetunga Notary

Public, being a valuable security knowing that the said deed had

not been signed by the persons named Lillian Victoria de Silva

Amarasekara Jayawardena and Nihal Dunstan Ranasinghe.

When the matter was taken up on the 20th of August 2014, upon

reading over the respective indictments, to the Petitioner and to the 1 st

Accused, the 1 st Accused pleaded guilty to all four counts in the indictment

and he was sentenced on each count for six months rigorous imprisonment

suspended for 5 years, a fine of Rs.1 0,0001- and a default sentence of 06

months.

The Petitioner opted for trial, pleaded not guilty to the 04 counts in the

indictment and the trial commenced on the 20th August 2014. At the end of

4

the trial learned High Court Judge ofKandy found the Petitioner guilty of all

04 counts and convicted the Petitioner.

The learned High Court Judge sentenced the Petitioner to 05 years

rigorous imprisonment in respect of count No.1, 15 years of rigorous

imprisonment each in respect of counts No.2, 3 and 4, in addition a fine of

Rs.50,0001- each was also imposed in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 coupled

with a default sentence of 01 year each in the event of non-payment of the

fines.

Being aggrieved by the purported judgment and the sentence the 2nd

Accused - Petitioner lodged an appeal against the judgment and the

sentence. Having done that the Petitioner has filed this Revision Application

in seeking to set aside the judgment and the sentence of the learned High

Court Judge of Kandy. Thus the Petitioner is seeking similar reliefs that had

been prayed for in the appeal by this application.

When this case was called on 15/05/2015 to support for interim relief

referred to in sub paragraph (v) of the prayers to the Petition, the learned

Senior State Counsel objected to the Petitioner's application. Further, the

Senior State Counsel raised the following two preliminary objections with

regard to the maintainability of the instant Revision Application.

(1) With the instant Revision Application being filed by the Petitioner

in the Court of Appeal subsequent to having lodged a final appeal,

the Petitioner is not in a position to have and maintain the instant

Revision Application (with the final appeal pending in the Court of

Appeal).

5

(2) The Petitioner has failed to plead exceptional circumstances that

are necessary for the invocation of the Revisionary Jurisdiction of

this Court, which is a discretionary remedy.

On the question of the aforesaid preliminary objections, both parties

have filed written submissions with case law authorities and have also

tendered oral submissions when the matter was taken up on 15.05.2015. I

have perused the entirety of the Petition and Affidavit of the Petitioner and

the written submissions and case law authorities filed by both parties.

The first question which arises for decision is as to whether the

Petitioner can invoke the powers in revision of this Court, if he had appealed

against the judgment made by the learned High Court Judge.

The Senior State Counsel for the Respondent submitted, in the event

this Court allows the Petitioner to pursue the instant Revision Application, it

would result in two applications being filed by a petitioner in the same

forum, seeking similar reliefs, where in one he exercises his statutory right

and in the other he seeks the indulgence of this Court to exercise the

discretionary powers of revision.

In the written submissions filed in this Court by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner, it was contended that, a revision

should be allowed only in exceptional circumstances when the Petitioner had

a right of appeal and particularly when it exercised. I do agree with the

learned President's Counsel and it is not an arguable issue. The trend of

authority clearly indicates that the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal

will be exercised if the exceptional circumstances exist only.

In the case of Atukorala vs Samyanathan (1939) 18 C.L. Rec. 200; 41

N.L.R. 165, 14 C.L.W. 109, Soertsz, J. pointed out at page 201 "This Court

has the right to revise any order made by an original Court, whether an

appeal has been taken against that order or not. Doubtless, that right

will be exercised in a case in which an appeal is already pending only in

exceptional circumstances." These observations were approved and

followed by Wijewardana, J. with Mosely, J. agreeing in the case of Silva

vs. Silva 44 N.L.R. 49; 26 C.L.W. 3.

In Rasheed Ali vs. Mohamed Ali 1981 (1) S.L.R. 262, it was held that

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and the

Court can in a fit case exercise that power whether or not an appeal lies.

In Thilagarathnam vs. E.A.P. Edirisinghe 1982 (1) S.L.R. 56, L.H. de

Alwis, J. remarked thus: "Though the Appellate Courts' powers to act in

revision were wide and would be exercised whether an appeal has been

taken against the order of the original court or not.

Dr. Ranaraja, J. commenting on the requirement of exceptional

circumstances in a revisionary application held as follows: "Thus the

general principle is that revision will not lie where an appeal or other

statutory remedy is available. It is only if the aggrieved party can show

exceptional circumstances, for seeking relief by way of revision, rather

than by way of appeal when such appeal is available to him as of right,

that the court will exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in the interests of due

administration of justice".

It was held in Attorney General vs. Herath, C.A. revision 2060/2004,

D.C. Colombo 68421 M.C.A. minute dated Ith December 2004, that the

7

existence of an appeal would not be an impediment to the filing of a

revision application provided there are exceptional circumstances and there

is no delay on the part of the Petitioner.

In Potman vs I,P. Dodanwela 74 N.L.R. 115 and Abdul Cader vs.

Sitty Nisa 52 N.L.R. 546, it was held, that the revisionary jurisdiction should

be exercised only in exceptional circumstances in circumstances where a

right of appeal is available to a party.

On a consideration of the above authorities, it is abundantly clear that

revisionary power would be exercised by this Court whether an appeal has

been filed against the order of the original court or not. But the revisionary

jurisdiction should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances. Hence I

reject the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel, that having lodged

a final appeal, the Petitioner is not in a position to have and maintain the

instant revision application but powers of revision should only be exercised

in exceptional circumstances.

Hence, this Court has the power to act in revision even though the

procedure of appeal is available in appropriate cases. The question which

has to be decided is whether the instant case is an appropriate case in which

this court should exercise discretionary powers of revision.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner also conceded that

revision is a discretionary remedy and it would not be made available if

there are no exceptional circumstances shown in the petition. The 2nd

preliminary objection raised by the Senior State Counsel is, that the

Petitioner has failed to plead exceptional circumstances that are necessary

for the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction.

8

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted, in

paragraphs 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the Petition, that the Petitioner has

pleaded exceptional grounds, reasons and circumstances. I have examined

the contents in paragraphs 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the Petition filed in this

Court where he alleges that the Petitioner has exceptional circumstances to

file this application. The learned President's Counsel has brought to our

notice irregularities which has taken place in the course of the trial.

On a perusal of paragraph 3.5.6 of the written submissions filed by

the learned President's Counsel, explicit it is that the denial of fair trial is

one main ground in which revision is sought in this matter. Further,

paragraph 4.3 explains the attitude of the learned High Court Judge in

carrying out his duties in a biased and a manner focused to see that this

accused is found guilty by any means is one of the main exceptional

circumstances. Has the Petitioner specifically or expressly pleaded such

exceptional circumstances in the body of the Petition? Answer is "No".

In the case of Peter Fernando vs Asia Umma (1938) 13 C.L.W. 25,

Poyser, S.P. J., refused to exercise the discretion because the point was

taken up for the first time only in the application and he stated, "I am

consequently asked to exercise revisionary powers on the ground that the

Petitioner's legal advisors were mistaken as to the procedure to raise a point

of law at the trial. I do not consider that these are grounds for granting this

application; it would in my opinion be establishing a very bad precedent, if I

were to hold otherwise".

In the submissions of the learned Senior State Counsel for the

respondent, she has stressed that the alleged "mistrial offending all

9

principles of administration of criminal justice" cannot at any event be

deemed to be a circumstance which warrant the petitioner to have and

maintain the instant revisionary application.

I am also of the view that the matters referred to in paragraphs 45, 46,

47, 48 and 49 of the Petition is not amount to exceptional circumstances as

required by law. It is abundantly clear that the Petitioner has not specifically

or expressly pleaded such exceptional circumstances in the body of the

Petition other than the substantial questions of law and irregularities which

have taken place in the course of the trial.

In Biso Menika v. Ran Banda and Others, CA 95/98 -CAN

09.01.2002 and followed by Urban Development Authority vs. Ceylon

Entertainments Ltd. And Another (Supra) it was held, that in order to justify

the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, on

examination of either the Petition or Affidavit must reveal a specific plea as

to the existence of special circumstances. In that case Nanayakkara 1.

observed that the presence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not

be sufficient if there is no express pleading to that effect in the Petition

whenever an application is made invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court.

The revisionary powers of this Court is a discretionary power and its

exercise cannot be demanded as of right unlike the statutory remedy of

appeal. Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

Court should select the cases in respect of which the extraordinary power of

revision should be adopted.

10

In Atukorale vs. Saminathan 41 N.L. R. 165 Soertsz, l. stated that the

right of the Court to revise any order made by an original Court will be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances. In Caderamanpulle vs. Ceylon

Paper Sacks 2001 (3) S.L.R. 172, the Court has held the existence of

exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of the powers

and the absence of such circumstances in any given situation results in

refusal of granting remedies. In Ameen vs. Rasid (Supra) Abraham C.J. has

explained the rationale for insisting on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction. According to

Abraham C.l. revision of an appealable order is an exceptional procedure

and a person seeking this method of rectification must show why this

extraordinary method is sought rather than the ordinary method of appeal.

Thus, the existence of exceptional circumstances is a process by

which the method of rectification should be adopted. In Perera vs. Silva

(Supra), Hutchinson C.l. has stated that if such selection process is not

available, then revisionary jurisdiction of the Court will become a gateway

for every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision

application to make the appeal in situations where the legislature has not

given the right of appeal.

Furthermore, III Dharmarathne and Another vs. Palm Paradise

Cabanas Ltd. 2003 (3) SLR 24, Gamini Amaratunga l. stated that the

practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional circumstances for

the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has

got hardened into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed.

11

Having referred to the authorities above and to the facts and

circumstances of this case it is my view that the Petitioner has failed to

disclose exceptional circumstances in order to invoke the jurisdiction of this

Court.

Therefore taking into consideration the entirety of the submissions

adduced by both parties, this Court upholds the preliminary objections raised

by the respondents and refuse to grant interim relief prayed for in the prayer

(v) of the Petition.

This is not a fit and proper case to invoke the discretionary revisionary

powers of this Court. Accordingly I dismiss the application of the

Petitioner.
