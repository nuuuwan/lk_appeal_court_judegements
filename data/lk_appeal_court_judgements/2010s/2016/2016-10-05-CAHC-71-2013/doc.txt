under Section 296 of the Penal Code. It is noted that the Tamil brief as

well as the English translation which has been accepted by Hon. Attorney-

General. Both do not reflect that the mandatory provision of Section

giving the jury option to the accused. He submits after verification and

consultation with the counsel for the Attorney-General. In those
