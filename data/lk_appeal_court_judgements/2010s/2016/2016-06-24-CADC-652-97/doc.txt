COUNSEL : S. Balapatabendi D.S.G. for the

Appellant

B.C. Balasuriya for the Respondent

ARGUED ON : 08th December, 2015

Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The plaintiff respondent had instituted an action against the defendant

appellant seeking damages in a sum of One Million Rupees for defamation.

The appellant had filed answer denying liability and stated that he acted

within his official duties and that he was not in a position to issue a "no

claims certificate" to the respondent since the respondent had not returned

all items in his possession when he retired. After trial the learned District

Judge had delivered judgment in favour ofthe respondent and being agreed

by the said jUdgment, the appellant had filed this application against the said

judgment dated 10107/1997.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the District Judge

failed to consider the issues raised by them at the trial regarding the lack of

territorial jurisdiction by the District Court of Mt. Lavinia and cited the

judgment in Wamakula vs Ramani Jayawardena (1990) 1 SLR 206. The

appellant stated under Sec. 187 of the Civil Procedure Code this issue

should have been dealt with and the decision should have been given in

favour of the appellant. The learned counsel for the respondent in answer

to this argument stated that the summons served by court on the appellants

were served through the Fiscal officer of the District Court Mt. Lavinia which

shows that the area in which the appellant resided was situated within the

District Court of Mt. Lavinia.

The appellants argued that the District Judge failed to appreciate the

material evidence given by the appellant and his witness regarding the

documents marked 01 and 02 which were not signed by the appellant and

that when you peruse those two documents it is evident that they were not

defamatory or produced with malicious intent. The counsel for the

respondent argued that the Trial Judge exhaustively analysed the oral

evidence and documentary evidence led at the trial with regard to handing

over of the items and also with regard to the decision taken by the Chairman

of the Airport and Aviation Services releasing the respondent from the

charges instituted by the appellant and had decided that the allegation was

not only false but also one made with malice.

I,

The appellant argued that he did not act negligently and disclose

information of the respondent in a qualified privileged occasion and that he

acted in his official capacity as recognized by court in Sirisena vs Ginige

(1992) 1 SLR 320.

The counsel for the appellant further stated that the law applicable to

Sri Lanka is the Roman Dutch Law and a mere prima facie examination and

application of a very broad area of Law relating to defamation will not result

in a successful establishment of such action. They further stated that the

appellant was not impregnated with a direct or indirect intention to injure the

respondent.

The learned counsel for the appellant citing the judgment in

Independent Newspapers Ltd vs Nissanka Parakrama Wijeratne (1995)

2 SLR 253 stated that the guidelines set out in the said judgment it is clear

that there was no intention whatsoever on the part of the appellant and that

the learned trial judge misdirected himself in awarding damages.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the defence of

"Qualified Privilege" raised by the appellant has been discussed and settled

in the cases of Perera vs Peiris 50 NLR 145 and De Costa vs The Times

of Ceylon Limited 62 NLR 265, and that it is a well settled principle that

when words used are defamatory of the complainant the burden of

negativing "Animus Injuriandi" rests upon the defendant.

The respondent further stated citing the judgment in Whitelaw vs

Concannon 48 NLR 265 that in an action for defamation the meaning which

the writer intends to convey is immaterial, therefore it was the burden cast

on the appellant to exonerate him from the "Animas Injuriandi" in the light of

the false and the defamatory statement he made against the respondent.

In the instant application this court has to decide on two main issues.

Did the trial Judge consider the issue on jurisdiction under section 187 of

the Civil Procedure Code. As stated by the respondent the summons in the

District Court case were served by the Fiscal officer of the District Court of

Mt. Lavinia to the appellant to the given address which shows that the

appellant was in the jurisdiction of the District Court of Mt. Lavinia and not

Moratuwa as stated by the appellant.

Did the learned District Judge consider the evidence placed before

him? It is a well established principle that the trial Judge is the best person

to decide on the facts placed before court. The oral and documentary

evidence led at the trial has been exhaustively analysed with regard to the

said allegation leveled against the respondent by the appellant by the trial

5

Judge. The handing over of the items mentioned and also the decision taken

by the Chairman of the Airport and Aviation Services Ltd releasing the

respondent from the charge initiated by the appellant had been considered

by the District Judge.

For the afore stated reasons I see no reason to set aside a well

considered judgment by the District Court. The judgment dated 10107/1987

is affirmed. Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,0001=.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

I agree.
