Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed this action for a declaration of title to the land described in

the schedule to the plaint, and for the ejetment of the Defendant Appellant and

possession of the said land described in the schedule to the plaint and for

damages and for a declaration that the purported deed of gift No. 2790 dated

1.9.1988 and attested by M.K. Sellarasa, N.P., of Trincomalee, is null and void.

The Defendant Appellant filed her Answer denying the averments

contained in the plaint and claimed that the land which is the subject matter of

the action originally belonged to her husband's relative S. Vaithialingam and

thereafter her husband occupied the land and by virtue of prescriptive right

under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance has prescribed title to the same

and has thereafter executed the said deed of gift No. 2790 to her and thus

prayed for declaration of title in her favour and in a sum of Rs. 500,000/- for

having made improvement to the said land. Also she averred that the Plaintiff

has failed to disclose that the disputed property has been vested in terms of

Section 472 of the Civil Procedure Code.

According to the Plaintiff, one Subramaniam Sithamparapillai Alagarajah

and Subramaniam Shanmugam as Trustees by deed of Lease No. 1250 daed 28th

May 1947 leased the property to Periyatamby Sinnathamby. After the demise

of the said Sinnathamby, his son Thambirajah succeeded to the leasehold rights.

The said Thambirajah by deed No. 2790 dated 1988.09.01 and attested by M.K. Selva rajah, executed a prescriptive deed. The Plaintiff by letter dated 14.07.1995 requested the Defendant to attorn to the said property as a lessee. The Defendant refused to attorn to the said property, contrarily as lessee of the said property. As a result of such refusal parties came before court.

, After trial the learned District Judge delivered judgment dated 27.09.1999 in favour of the Plaintiff respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned District Judge of Trincomalee the Defendant Appellant had preferred this appeal to this court . .

It was the position of the Plaintiff Respondent that the Defendant Appellant's husband has come to occupy the said premises with their permission. That by lease Agreement. It is to be observed that by producing the receipts which were marked as ... 6 to .. 9 plaint has evidence that the

Plaintiff's has established this fact.

In Ruberu and Another Vs. Wijessooriya (1998) 1 Sri L.R 58 DE Z.

GUNAWARDANA, J. held that:-

5

"Whether it is a licensee or lessee, the question of title is foreign to a suit

in ejectment against either, the licensee obtaining possession is deemed to

obtain it upon the terms that he will not dispute the title of the Plaintiff without

whose permission he would not have got it. The effect of Section 116 of the

Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title under

which he is in occupation he must first quit the land. The fact that the licensee

obtained possession from the Plqintiff is perforce an admission of the fact that

the title resides in the Plaintiff."

Further it was held that

lilt is an inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will never be

permitted either to question the title of the person who gave him the

lease or the license or the permission to occupy or possess the land or set

up want of title in that person. "

In Pathirana vs Jayasuriya 58 NLR 169, the supreme Court held that the

lessee who has entered into occupation must first restore the property to his

landlord in fulfillment of his contractual obligation which the defendant in this

case has failed to fulfil.

In the case of Alvar Pillai vs Karuppan - 4 N.L.R 321 it was held that:

III am of the view that the Defendant is not entitled to dispute the title of

the Plaintiff. In this case the defendant was permitted to occupy the

premises with the permission of the Plaintiff. In my opinion the defendant

has no defence to this action. He must give up possession to the Plaintiff."

6

In Visvalingam vs Gajaweera -56 NLR 111 it was held that:

II Even assuming that the Defendant had become owner of the

entire premises, it was not open for him to refuse to surrender

possession to the landlord. He must first give up possession and

then it would be open to him to litigate about the ownership."

On a consideration of the totality of the aforementioned

circumstances and evidence and on a balance of probability I am inclined

to accept the position taken by the Plaintiff that the defendant came into

the land in question with the leave and license of the Plaintiff.

The Defendant further took up the position that she has prescribed

the property. The legal position which governs prescription for

immovable property is contained in section 3 of the Ordinance No. 22 of

1871.

It has been pointed out in the decided cases and the principle of

law is well established that a person who bases his title in adverse

possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence to succeed in a

claim of prescriptive possession.

In the case reported in 80 NLR 292 - De Silva vs Commissioner of

Inland Revenue it was held that the the principle of law is well established

that a person who bases his title in adverse possession must show by

clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed.

7

As we held in the case of Sirajudeen and two others vs Abbas 1994

SLR vol. 2 page 365, where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance, in order to defect the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests

squarely and fairly on him to establish starting point for his or her

acquisition of prescriptive rights. As regards the mode of proof of

prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses as to

possession are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the

witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of possession

has to be decided thereupon by court.

In M.Rasiah vs I Somapala - C.A. 786/98{F) decided on 21.02.2008

A.W.A. Salam J held that:

liAs has been pointed out in the decided cases the principle of law is

well established that a person who bases his title in adverse possession

must show by clear and unequivocal evidence to succeed in a claim of

prescription the possession must be a denial of the title of the true owner.

Further the evidence must prove that the acts of the person in possession

is irreconcilable with the rights of the true owner, in other words the

person claims to he possessed the corpus should maintain his clam as of

right as against the true owner. Where thee is no hostility to or denial of

the title to the true owner, as has occurred in this case there can be no

adverse possession.

8

In Eileen Eunice de silva vs G. liyanage Jayanona C.A 43/2000{F}

decided on 02.07.2013 {page 375} Upaly Abeyratne J.,. held that:

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or

Plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such character as is

incompatible with the title of the owner.

The Appellant has not led evidence of any witnesses or has not

produced any supporting documents to prove that she or her husband

commenced a title adverse to or independent of that of the Respondent.

I am of the view that for a claim of prescriptive possession to

succeed such claim need to be established by assertive evidence of

uninterrupted and undisturbed possession for a period of over 10 years

and as the clam totally lacks such assertive evidence except probably the

mere fact of occupation only. In all the circumstances of this case I would

therefore hold that the defendant's claim to prescriptive title must

necessarily fail.

Although the defendant is claiming prescriptive rights on

theproperty in question she has not demonstrated as to the date when

she began adverse possession and how such adverse possession

commenced. Without adducing any evidence as to the date of

commencement of adverse possession, the Defendant will not be in a

position to make a claim on prescription to the property in question.

Accordingly, the defendant has not established the requirement of

9

uninterrupted and undisturbed possession which are explicitly adverted

to in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. In such circumstances it is

quite apparent that the Petitioner cannot base any claim on prescription.

I have considered the entire judgment and see no reason to

interfere because the trial Judge has given cogent reasons. I do not wish

to interfere with the primary facts of this case. Trial Judge hs arrived at a

correct conclusion. Appellate court should not, without cogent reasons

interfere with primary facts (1993(1) SLR 332 & 282).

For the above reasons I see no reason to disturb the judgment of

the learned District Judge. Accordingly the appeal of the Defendant-

Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/-.

Registrar is directed to forward the original case record together

with the copy of the judgment to the District Court of Trincomalee.
