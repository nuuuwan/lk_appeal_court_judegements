Malinie Gunaratne, J.

This is a Revision Application preferred by the Petitioner, seeking to set

aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Civil Appellate High

Court, of Galle, dated 10106/2010.

When the application was taken up for hearing on 12.03.2015, the Counsel

for the 2nd Respondent raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of

this application.

It was agreed by both parties to file written submissions on the question of

the preliminary objections that were raised relating to the maintainability of this

action.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent is, since the

impugned order had been made by the learned High Court Judge of the Civil

4

Appellate High Court holden in Galle, the Petitioner cannot invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court with regard to the impugned order. Further, he has

contended, that since the power to issue orders in the nature of writs was given

to the High Courts under Article 154 P (4), only the Supreme Court can revise

an order which is of the nature of the order canvassed in this Revision

Application.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is, according to the

circular which was applicable at that time the Petitioner had to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Civil Appellate High Court. This fact is not disputed by the

Respondents.

Having stated the submissions made by both Counsel, let me now tum to

consider the legal position of the preliminary objection which was raised by the

2nd Respondent.

The powers laid down in Article 154 P (4) clearly shows the jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Courts to issue orders in the nature of Writs. The said

Article is as follows:-

Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue according to law :-

(b) Orders in the nature of Writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo,

Mandamus and Quo Warranto, against any person exercising within the

Province any power under -

(i) Any law ................. .

Under Article 154 P (6) an appeal may be made in accordance with Article

138 to the Court of Appeal from a final order, judgment or sentence of the

Provincial High Court made under Article 154 P (4) (b). As such the appellate

5

jurisdiction lies with the Court of Appeal in the case of writs, which are issued

by the Provincial High Court.

Hence, now the sole question arising for decision in this case is, since the

impugned order had been made by the learned Civil Appellate High Court

Judge, whether the Petitioner can invoke the jurisdiction of this Court or should

have invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

It is relevant to note, that the Civil Appellate High Court had been

exercising writ jurisdiction according to the circular, issued by the Honourable

Chief Justice, which was applicable at the time when the Petitioner invoked the

jurisdiction of the Civil Appellate High Court and the impugned Order had been

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge acting on that circular as the High

Court Judge, holden Southern Province in Galle. Furthermore, it is important to

note, that there is no applicable provisions to make an appeal to the Supreme

Court, with regard to the orders or judgments pertaining to a writ application

heard by the Civil Appellate High Court of the Province.

The Petitioner in this case had invoked the jurisdiction of the Civil

Appellate High Court, according to the circular issued at that time and it is

important to note, that the Respondents had not raised any jurisdictional

objection there. This Court cannot find fault with the Petitioner and deprive the

right of appeal of the Petitioner on an administrative function, since the

Petitioner had to act according to the circular prevailing at that time. Hence, I

am of the view, it is an administrative function of the High Court and there is no

question with regard to the jurisdiction of the High Court.

Hence, as far as the instant case is concerned, I am unable to agree with

the contention of the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent, that the Petitioner

6

cannot invoke the jurisdiction of this Court with regard to the impugned order

made by the learned High Court Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Galle.

Taking into consideration all the facts and submissions made in this case,

I reject the contention of the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent and

overrule the preliminary objections raised by him.

The view of this Court is under Article 154 P (b), the Petitioner is entitled

to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court.
