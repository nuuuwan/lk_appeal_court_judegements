P.R. Walgama, J

The Petitioner- Appellant has invited this Court to reVIew

and set aside the order of the Learned High Court

Judge dated 01. 09. 2010.

The Petitioner- Appellant moved the Provincial High Court

holden at Kurunegala, for an issuance of a mandate In

the nature of a writ of Certiorari against the 1 st to

3rd Respondents, to quash the decision of the 1 st

Respondent.

The said decisions are marked as PI0, Pl1.

It is contention of the Petitioner- Appellant that she IS

In possesslOn of the subject land by virtue of State

grant, issued under and In terms of Section 19(4) of

2

the Land Development Ordinance, which IS more fully

described in the schedule to the said Grant.

It IS asserted by the Petitioner-Appellant that she IS

In posseSSIOn of Lots 141,145, and a portion of 142

morefUllY described In the schedule to the said Grant,

and depicted in plan No. 1582.

According to the afore said plan Lot No. 142 IS a

road way, and it is the access to the lots 143 and

129, according to the plan stated above. But it is the

position of the Petitioner- Appellant that the occupants of

the lots Nos. 129 and 143 have never been used the

disputed lot 142 as the access to their lands.

It IS asserted by the Petitioner- Appellant that she has

used a portion of the said lot 142 for a poultry farm

and her predecessors have cultivated coconut on the

said disputed land.

It IS being noted that the 1st Respondent has acted

on the complaint made by the 3rd Respondent of an

obstruction of the above road way by the Petitioner-

Appellant.

On the facts stated above it IS apparent that Petitioner

- Appellant has accepted that the said disputed lot 142

IS a lot allocated for a road way and could not be

used for any other purpose VIZ for cultivation or for

construction.

The said application was inquired In to by the

Learned High Court Judge holden at Kegalle and as he

was of the view that Provincial High Court is denuded

of jurisdiction to hear and determine as the said

application deals with the State Land, had dismissed

the application of Petitioner- Appellant.

The subject matter being the Lot No. 142 IS vested

with the state and by letter marked as PI 0 the 1 st

Respondent had informed the Petitioner- Appellant to

remove the obstruction if any for the use of the

same.

Being aggrieved by the said

Petitioner- Appellant appeal to

said order set aside or vacate.

When this matter was fIxed for argument the Appellant

was absent and unrepresented, although the notices has

been dispatched, indicating the date fIxed for argument.

Therefore the Court proceeded to hear the argument of

Counsel for the Respondent.

In considering the argument set forth by the counsel

for the Respondent this court IS In agreement of the

same as the subject land is a stated land which falls

under Schedule 9 of the Thirteenth Amendment to the

Constitution.

Constitution with Writ jurisdiction.

Article 154 P(4)(B) of the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution contemplates the ambit of Writ jurisdiction

of the Provincial High Court to deal with the matters

set out In the Provincial Council List. The said

proposition was dealt in the case of WERAGAMA .VS.

OTHERS (SC. Appeal 21/2013)

wherein it was decided that the Provincial High Court

has no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P (4)

in relation to matters concerning State Land.

Hence for the foregoing reasons this Court IS of the

VIew that the Appellant's application is devoid of merits

and should stand dismissed.

Accordingly we dismissed the appeal subject to a costs

of Rs.5000/.
