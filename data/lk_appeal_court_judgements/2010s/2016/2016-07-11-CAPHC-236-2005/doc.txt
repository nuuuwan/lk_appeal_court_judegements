P.R.Walgama, J

This appeal IS brought by the Appellant against the

decisions of the Learned High Court Judge and the

Learned Magistrate accordingly.

The background facts that turned out to be

relevant, appear from what follows;

The Officer In Charge of the Police Station Galle

instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Galle In

case bearing No. 8342, in terms of Section 66 (1) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, by

filing an information of a land dispute which will

culminate to the breach of the peace.

In the said information the following facts were

reported;

The dispute between the 1 st party Respondent and the

2nd party Respondent, began with the opening of an

entrance by the 2nd Party -Respondent, to the

passage, supposed to be claimed by the 1st Party-

Respondent as a part of his land. The stance of

4

,; I I

the 2nd Party -Respondent IS that the disputed strip

of land was used as a path to clear sewage of

the respective properties. Further it is stated by the

2nd Party Respondent that the said strip of land

belonged to the State and therefore the Appellant

cannot claim the ownership of the disputed

passageway.

Therefore it IS asserted by the 2ND Party - Respondent

that disputed passage way was used by him to

have access to his house from the rear side, and

had admitted that some renovations were effected,

and the gate therein was re fIxed accordingly.

In analyzing the facts of the case the Learned

Magistrate was of the VIew that the 1 st Party-

Respondent-Petitioner- Appellant has not proved the

fact that the disputed passageway was used

exclusively by him. Further it was the observation of

the Learned Magistrate that the windows of the

house of the 2ND Respondent, are opened towards

the passage. If the said passage was a private land

belonging to the Appellant, the Respondent would

have not have had the

passage

Learned

way. Therefore

Magistrate that

windows opened towards the

it was concluded by the

the 2nd Party Respondent,

had been using the said disputed strip of land.

I t was also noted by the Learned Magistrate, that

although the Appellant has stated that the gate was

5

J

locked by him and the key of the gate was with

him, but nevertheless he had not said so In his

statement to the police, and as such the Learned

Magistrate was of the view that the statemen t of the

Appellant is not trustworthy.

From the facts surfaced above the Learned

Magistrate was of the VIew that the disputed strip

of land had been used in common by both parties.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

Magistrate, the Party -Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant, moved In revlslOn to the High Court to

have the said order vacated.

The Learned High Court Judge having considered

the reasons adduced by the Learned Magistrate In

his order, had unequivocally agreed with him and

had dismissed the reVlSlOn application of the 18t

Party- Petitioner- Appellant's application accordingly.

In the above setting the Learned High Court Judge

was of the view that there is no exceptional reasons

adduced by the Petitioner- Appellant for the High Court

to exerCIse the Revisionary jurisdiction to vacate or

set aside the impugned order of the Learned

Magistrate, and upheld the same.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

High Court Judge, the Petitioner- Appellant has

appealed to this Court to have the said orders set

aside or vacate.

When the impugned orders

Court Judge and the Learned

the said back drop, this Court

of the Learned High

Magistrate viewed In

is compel to arrive

at the irresistible conclusion that the Appellant's

application IS devoid of merit and should stand

dismissed subject to a costs of Rs 5000/.
