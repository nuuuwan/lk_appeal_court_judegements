This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Matara.

The facts are briefly as follows. The Petitioner - Respondent - Appellant

(the Appellant) filed an information in the Magistrate Court of Morawaka

on 3rd March 2003 under section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Procedure

II

Code Act stating that a dispute has arisen affecting land, a breach of the

peace is threatened or likely. She pleaded that the land more fully

described in the affidavit was in her possession and she has been

dispossessed by the 1st Respondent - Petitioner - Respondent (the 1st

Respondent) on 7th January 2003 and moved the Court to make a

determination that she is entitle to posses and to place her in possession.

The 1st Respondent filed an affidavit and pleaded that he owned and

possessed the land in dispute and moved to dismiss the action. The 2nd

Respondent intervened and filed affidavit stating that he was the previous

owner and has transferred it to the 1 st Respondent and denied that any

breach of peace has taken place. The learned Magistrate pronounced a

determination that the Appellant was in possession and he has been

dispossessed within two months prior to the institution of the action and

ordered to place him in possession. Being aggrieved by the order of the

learned Magistrate, the 1 st Respondent moved in revision to the High

Court of Matara. The Learned High Court Judge set aside the order of the

learned Magistrate and dismissed the action. This appeal is from that

order.

The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the action on two

grounds. The first ground is that the learned Magistrate has failed to

consider whether the breach of the peace is threatened or likely before

proceeding any further. Section 66 of the Primary Procedure Code Act

empowers the Primary Court Judge to inquire in to a land dispute only if

the breach of the peace is threatened or likely. The section reads thus;

66. (1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach o/the

peace is threatened or likely-

(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute-

3

(i) shall with the least possible delay file an

information regarding the dispute in the Primary

Court ... ..... or

(ii) ............ .

(b) any party to such dispute may file an information by

affidavit in such Primary Court setting out the facts and the

relief sought and specifying as respondents the names and

addresses of the other parties to the dispute .......... .

Unless the breach of the peace is threatened or likely, the Court

does not confer jurisdiction. Sub section 2 of the section 66 confer

jurisdiction to Court only on an information filed under sub section 1, and

the information can be filed only if the breach of the peace is threatened

or likely. If the information is filed by the police under sub section 1, it is

not necessary for the Court to satisfy that the breach of the peace is

threatened or likely. It has been held in the case of [1994] 2 Sri L R 117

Punchi Nona v. Padumasena and others that;

Where the information is filed under section 66(1) (a) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act by a police officer a Primary Court

is vested with jurisdiction to inquire into the dispute. The Police

Officer is empowered to file the information only if there is a

dispute affecting land and the breach of the peace is thre"atened or

likely.

In the same case His Lordship Ismail, J. referred to the case of

Velupillai and Others v. Sivanathan [1993] 1 Sri L. R. 123 at 126 with

approval and held further that;

However, when an information is filed by a party to the dispute

under section 66(1) (b) it is left to the judge to satisfy himself that

there is a dispute affecting land owing to which a breach of the

peace is threatened or likely. As observed in Velupillai and Others

v. Sivanathan (1) " ... when an information is filed under section

66(1) (b) the only material that the Magistrate would have before

him is the affidavit information of an interested person and in such

a situation without the benefit of further assistance from a police

report, the Magistrate should proceed cautiously and ascertain for

himself whether there is a dispute affecting land and whether a

breach of the peace is threatened or likely".

In the present case the learned Magistrate has failed to consider

whether the breach of the peace is threatened or likely. The learned

Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the objection to the jurisdiction

was not taken at the earliest opportunity and therefore it is too late to raise

in the appeal. This is an incorrect submission. The 2nd Respondent in

paragraph (x) of his affidavit dated 12th May 2003 stated that there is no

breach of the peace has taken place. In the proceedings under section 66,

no issues were raised. The Primary Court Judge is expected to consider

the affidavits and the documents (if any) before making his

determination. This being an information filed by an interesting party

under section 66(1)(b), and the alleged threat to the breach of the peace is

being denied by the opposing party, the Magistrate should proceed

cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there is a dispute affecting

land threatening the breach of the peace or likely. Failure to do so vitiates

the proceeding.

The other ground that the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the

action is that the failure of the learned Magistrate to act under sub section

6 of section 66 which requires the Judge to make every effort to induce II

the parties and the persons interested (if any) to arrive at a settlement of

the dispute.

I think I need not to express any view on this matter because the

case fails on the first ground, that is, the failure to consider whether the

breach of the peace is threatened or likely.

Under these circumstances, I don't see any reason to interfere with

the findings of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. No costs.
