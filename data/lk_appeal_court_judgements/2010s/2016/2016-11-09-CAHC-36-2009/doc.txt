Counsel for the accused-appellant informs Court that the Accused-

Appellant was charged for procuration, in terms of Section 360 (a)(1) of the

Penal Code. From the year 2005 this matter had been argued till 2009, before

several benches and subsequently postponed on various reasons that on various

occasions and a point of law is being argued before the Supreme Court now. In

the circumstances, specially considering the time period he further states that

he is instructed to withdraw this appeal and moves this Court to act under

Section 359 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and back date the sentence

to the date of the judgment, and all other sentences imposed by the High Court

Judge to stand.

to the application made on behalf of the Appellant provided that the fine of Rs.
