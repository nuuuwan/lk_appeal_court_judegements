The 5th defendant- petitioner had filed this leave to appeal application to set aside the order of the

Learned additional District Judge delivered on 3-1-2003. After considering the petition affidavit and

documents and hearing the submissions of both counsels in this respect the court granted leave to

appeal of this application on 18-01-2006. The appeal was thereafter fixed for argument on 20-06-

2007 both counsels appearing in court invited court to decide this matter on the written submissions

already filed. Accordingly court reserved its judgment for 25-01-2008. However this case was later

taken up for argument before the present bench and oral submissions of both counsels were heard

and judgment was reserved for 27-04-2016.

The 5th defendant- petitioner by his petition dated 2nd January 2003 has appealed to this court to set

aside an order made to the surveyor/Court Commissioner to prepare a fresh scheme of partition.

Allotting to the 5th defendant- petitioner her entitlement of 4.3 perches according to plan No. 2099

dated 7-1-2003 made by K.P. Wijeweera, Licensed surveyor or in the alternative allotting 3.8

perches according to plan No. 2101 dated 11-1-2003 made by K.P. Wijeweera, Licensed Surveyor.

This action was instituted by the plaintiff-respondent seeking to partition the land called

Siyambalagahawatte for 1/8th share. The corpus to be partitioned was depicted in plan No. 938 dated

21-4-1997 and the said plan and report were annexed here to marked as 'B' and 'Bl' respectively.

The Journal entries in case was annexed here to marked as 'A'. By the judgment dated 19-10-2000,

and the Interlocutory Decree in terms of the 5th defendant petitioner was allotted 5 perches out of the

said land. It was also decreed that the parties are entitled to the improvements in terms of the report

to the Preliminary plan. The judgment and the Interlocutory Decree was marked 'C' and 'D'

respectively. A commission was issued to the surveyor S.D, Ediriwickrema to prepare and forward

to court a scheme of partition in terms ofthe Interlocutory Decree. The said surveyor forwarded plan

4

i I ! I

No. 1562 dated 20-11-2001 together with a report which said plan and report are marked as 'E' And

'E l' respectively.

The petitioner filed the statement of objections supported by affidavit objecting to the said scheme

of partition and praying that her entitlement be given in Lot 1. The 5th defendant petitioner in her

evidence at the trial stated that she was residing on the North Western boundary on the corpus and

that she was in possession of a portion of the corpus which lay to the South of her residence. However

the court commissioner has in the scheme allotted to the petitioner Lot 1 being in an extent of 1.83

perches, out of the land which she was in possession and Lot 4 a further extent of 1.97 perches

towards the East of the corpus aggregating to 3.8 perches. The petitioner complained that by the said

manner of division she could not make any practical use of the land which she was entitled to. She

pleaded that the court commissioner should have given her full entitlement to abut her residence on

the North West of the corpus and that the same would not cause any prejudice to the plaintiff who

had been allotted Lot 2. She also pleaded that the registrar of the District Court has, without any

authority of the court annexed to the commission issued to the surveyor a note to have regard to the

boundaries marked in red lines in plan No. 2852 made by G.O.R. De Silva, licensed surveyor, and

the court commissioner has, acting on the said notes, split up the petitioner's entitlement as Lots 1

and 4. The petitioner has also stated at the scheme inquiry that the surveyor Ediriwickrema testified

and stated that the petitioner informed him that the land to the North of the corpus belong to the

petitioner. He also stated that he allotted Lot 1 a narrow strip to the petitioner as the plaintiff objected

to a larger portion being given complaining that if that was done Lot 2 would become narrow. In

cross examination the surveyor admitted that Lot 6 provided access to all the Lots except Lot 1. By

order delivered on 3-1-2003 the Leamed District Judge directed the surveyor to give the extent of

1.83 perches to abut Lot 4 and the Learned District Judge has confirmed the scheme of the court

commissioner subject to the said amendment. 11-2-2003 was ordered as the date for Final decree.

Being aggrieved by the said order ofthe Learned District Judge delivered on 3-1-2003 the petitioner

has appealed therefrom on the grounds of appeal as set out in paragraph 7, (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) of the

petition. It was contended by the 5th defendant- petitioner that the proposed scheme which was

confirmed by the said order is wrong and erroneous in law in as much as it is not in conformity with

the judgment and the Interlocutory Decree. It was urged that the said order cannot stand for this

reason alone. It has been decreed that the parties are entitled to their improvements in terms of the

report to the preliminary plan. The report to the preliminary plan states that the petitioner claimed

the temporary buildings 1, 2, and 3and the tube well. These building and the tube well are situated

on the North Eastern boundary of the corpus. The petitioner claimed her entitlement of the land to

include these improvements. It was urged by the counsel of the petitioner that these improvements

should be allotted if possible to the co- owner who had made the improvements. He should not be

required to pay the compensation to the other co-owner for these improvements. It was urged that if

the land on which the improvements are made is superior in points of fertility to the rest of the land,

a different consideration applies. It was urged that in the present case that petitioner had effected the

improvements with the consent of the other co-owners. There is no evidence that the position of the

land on which the petition has effected improvements is more fertile that the balance land.

Accordingly it was also decided in the case of Thevchanamoorthy Vs Appakuddy 51 NLR, 317

page that the co-owner should be allotted the portion which contains his improvements, whenever

it is possible to do so. It was also urged that the Learned District Judge erred that there was no

evidence before court that the land to the north to Lot 1 belong to the petitioner. It was urged that

the petitioner in her evidence at the trial categorically stated that by deed No. 2328 dated 23-12-1983

marked as D 5. She purchased 5 perches to abut her land. The court commissioner in his evidence

admitted that the petitioner informed him that the house to the North of the corpus belong to the

petitioner. The petitioner had stated that she purchased this land since there was no room in the land

6

iIlIII

II i f

" Ifl i

where her house stood for the waste pit and the lavatory pit and the building put up of the 5 perches.

It was also urged that the Learned District Judge erred in confirming the commissioner's plan subject

to the variation of giving the petitioner allotment in one Lot far away from her residence. The

proposed scheme at least gave the petitioner a small strip of land to abut her residence. The

amendment does not give the petitioner any land to abut her residence. The strip ofland given to the

petitioner, is also so narrow that it cannot be put to any use. The commissioner had stated that it is

only 10 feet wide and the Urban Development Authority will not grant permission for any building

to be constructed there on. It was urged that the petitioner was allotted 5 perches in the judgment

and in the interlocutory Decree. The two lots allotted to her by the commissioner amounts to only

2.3 perches. The commissioner had stated that the balance has been due to the proportionate

reduction for the access road. lfthe petitioner's entitlement is given to abut her residence she does

not require any access road. Further the petitioner stated that in fact by a proportionate reduction for

the road she should not lose 1.2 perches but only 0.07 perches. Therefore petitioner's lots should be

4.3 perches. On the other hand, the extent reduced from the lots allotted to the plaintiff is less than

what in fact it should be. It was also submitted that the entire entitlement of 3.8 perches as calculated

by the commissioner or 4.3 perches as calculated by the surveyor K.P. Wijeweera can be given to

the petitioner in one lot to abut her residence without any inconvenience or prejudice to the plaintiff

respondent as evidence by the said two plans. Even if the petitioner entitlement is calculated at 4.3

perches there 12 feet left between the Southern boundary of that Lot and the means of access. The

breadth of that portion would be about 14 feet if the petitioner is given the lesser extent of 3.8

perches. The petitioner stated that in addition to the 12-14 feet the plaintiff who has been allotted

Lot 2 has the advantage of the means of access, for which the petitioner has contributed without

having any use thereof.

The 5th defendant- petitioner has prayed that the order of additional District Judge delivered on 3-

1-2003 be set aside and order be made to surveyor/Court commissioner to prepare a fresh scheme of

partition allotting the 5th defendant- petitioner her entitlement of 4.3 perches according to plan No.

2009 dated 7-1-2003 made by K.P. Wijeweeera, licensed surveyor or in the alternative allotting 3.8

perches according to plan No. 2101 dated 11-1-2003 made by K.P. Wijeweera.

On a perusal of the record we find that there is no plan filed of record numbered 2009 dated 7-1-

2003 by K. P. Wijeweera, licensed surveyor. What is filed of record is plan no. 2099 dated 7-1-2003

marked as 'K'. The plan No. 2101 dated 11-1-2003 also drawn by K.P.Wijeweera, licensed surveyor

is filed of record marked as 'L'. On a scrutiny of both these plans we find that the means of access

to the public Road in respect of Lot 1 has not been demarcated by the surveyor. It is trite Law that

in effecting a partition proper rights of way should be provided within the corpus to the district

allotments as means of access to a public right of way.

In the present case these conditions have not been complied with by the surveyor. C. Amarasinghe

Vs. Wanigasooriya (1994)2 SLR 303, Kanthaiya Vs. Sinnathamby ( 1913) 2 Balasingham

notes of cases 19, S. Thambaiya Vs. Sinnathamby 61 NLR 921.

The 5th defendant- respondent has tendered to court the alternative scheme of partition and has

produced plan No. 2101 dated 11-1-2003 which said scheme of partition is also not acceptable for

the reason set above. Counsel for the 5th respondent- petitioner has indicated to court that the 5th

respondent- petitioner portion of land has not been given at one unit and as such that the 5th

defendant- respondent has been deprived of his legal entitlement accordingly. The Learned District

Judge in his order dated 3-1-2003 has directed the surveyor to the said allotment ofland to the 5th

defendant- petitioner as one allotment of land including the improvements. However we find that

the surveyor in alternative plan No. 2099 dated 7th Jan 2003 the right of way to the said allotment

8

{ I 1 I It I l I f I " f r I!

Lot No. 1 is not provided. The 5th defendant- petitioner- respondent has waived his rights for right

of way over the said land as shown in the premises to the North West adjoining the land in dispute.

The right of access to said allotment marked Lot 1 would be provided over the plaintiff respondent

land. It was contended that it would narrow the plaintiff allotment of land. However we find the

portion of Land which the plaintiff- respondent loses will be provided from the Eastern side from

said allotment. We do not think that the Learned District Judge has erred in coming to the decision

that the 5th defendant- respondent should be given his portion of land in one allotment including the

improvement he has made and thus for existing. However we are of the view that the said scheme

of partition is not acceptable to this court. Accordingly we direct that the fresh scheme of partition

to be drawn by the surveyor providing the 5th defendant- respondent access from the main road along

the western boundary to the said allotment of land allotted to the plaintiff- respondent. Accordingly

we affirm the Leamed District Judge's order subject to above variation and dismiss this application

with cost.
