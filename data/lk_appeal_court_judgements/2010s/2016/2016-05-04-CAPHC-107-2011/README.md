The brief facts necessary to dispose of this appeal

are mentioned here under;

The Petitioner - Appellant was member of the 1st

Respondent Multi purpose Co-operative Society.

By a Special General Meeting of the

Respondent Society, held on 29.02.1992, a resolution

was passed to enable the 1st Respondent to

purchase

them, for

lands and block them out and sell

the purpose of gaInIng some benefits to

the 1 st Respondent Society. Pursuant to the

afore said the Board of Directors on 13.07.2000

passed a resolution In order to purchase the

land called 'EGODAWATTE' for the above

purpose.

Consequently, the said land was blocked out and was .

re- named as President Park.

The Petitioner opted to purchase a block

accordingly the 1st Respondent transferred the

and

lot

Further it 1S said that the 12 Respondent by his

1972, to determine whether

The 3rd Respondent by a letter dated 12.04.2010

ordered the Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 160,000/

within 30 days thereof,

Subsequent to the afore said the 1 st Respondent had

granted another 60 days for the Petitioner to vacate

It IS also contended by the Petitioner - Appellant that

the 1st Respondent has sold certain lots for a lesser

price than that was decided initially.

Further it is alleged by the Petitioner - Appellant that

the 3rd Respondent failed to afford an opportunity to

the Appellant to be heard which contravenes the

prOVISO to Section 66(1) of the Act.

Hence In the above setting the Petitioner-Appellant

moves for the following reliefs inter alia;

For an order In the nature of a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the orders of the 3rd

Respondent enumerated In the documents marked P12

and P13.

For an order In the nature of a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the findings of the said . . held InqUIry In

terms of Section 46

(1 ) of the Act In to the purchase of the said

lot 35 of PRESIDENT PARK land by the

Petitioner.

In objecting to the above suit of the Petitioner-

Appellant the 2nd and 3rd Respondents planked their

position on the following facts;

That the Petitioner -Appellant has moved for time to

vito 90 days to pay the said amount of Rs.

162,000/, and it IS ImprOper for the Petitioner to

seek relief as moved for when he had time to pay

the said amount.

Besides it IS stated that the 6 th and the 8th

Respondents who also faced

already paid the estimate

the same charges has

amount to the

Respondent Society.

The Learned High Court Judge by his judgment

dated 4th July 2011 dismissed the Petitioner-

Application on the following grounds;

It was observed by the Learned High Court Judge

that the document marked P12, the order d1rectIng

the Petitioner-Appellant to pay the balance sum due

on the sale of lot 35 has been made in terms of

Section 66(I)(a) of the Co-operative Societies Act No.lS

of 1972 as amended by Acts No. 32 of 1983 and

No. 11 of 1992.

Further it 1S to be noted that the 3rd

Respondent has afforded an opportunity for the

Petitioner - Appellant to present his case and the

Learned High Court Judge was of the VIew

that . . has been held and had an 1nqu1ry

conlmented on the fact that the Petitjunel - AiJpellCint A- by his J,a~ dated 15th Apri12010 sought 90 days

to settle the amount due 1n full. The said letter marked as 2R2 does not indicate the fact

that he was seeking to canvass the validity of

the inquiry held or the decision of the 3rd Respondent

to recover the money.

Thus the Learned High Court Judge was of

the V1ew that there 1S no reason to set

aside the decision of the 3rd Respondent to

recover the money due to the 1 st Respondent

Society.

The Petitioner - Appellant being aggrieved by the

appealed

order set

said determination of the lower Court

to this court to have the said

aside.

The Petitioner- Appellant 1n asserting the facts stated

above has assailed the impugned order on the

grounds stated below;

That the Learned High Court Judge has erred

1n arnv1ng at the conclusion that the law

does not expect the 3 rd Respondent to hold an . . 1nqu1ry 1n terms of Co-operative Societies Act No.

5 of 1972.

That the Learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider that to recover money as per document

marked P12, 1S made contrary to law and

violation of legitimate expectation of the Petitioner -

Appellant.

The 2nd and the 3rd Respondents has reiterated the

following facts;

11

I il

I

That the said impugned order has been made

by the 3rd Respondent In terms of Section

66(1)(a) of the Co-operati ve Societies Act No. 05

of 1972 which has been marked as P12.

That the Petitioner-Appellan t has filed a writ

application In the High Court of Kurunegala only

after two months of the pronouncemen t of the

said impugned order. In addition it IS said that

the document marked as P13 IS not an order but

only a letter, therefore as it IS there IS no order

In force to be quashed by way of a writ of

certiorari.

It IS also contended by the Respondent that the

Petitioner - Appellant has not disclose material

facts . . V1S a-V1S the document marked 2Vl. The

pith and substance of the Respondent's case 1S

the above said lots had been purchased for a

lesser pnce which IS much below the market

value of the suit property.

The Respondent has also adverted Court to the

fact the Petitioner - Appellant's undertaking to pay

the said amount of Rs. 162,000/ within 60 days

by his letter dated

2V2.

15.04.2010, which is marked as

Hence when the said impugned order is reviewed in

the above back drop I am of the view that the sRid

order is unattended with error.

Thus the appeal IS dismissed subject to a cost of

Rs. 10,000/.

Appeal is dismissed.
