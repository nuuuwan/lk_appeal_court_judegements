to the

May 2008 the 3 rd

Respondent had

illegally started constructing a

been used as threshing floor belonging to the

Appellants.

The Appellants had informed the said illegal

act of the 3 rd Respondent, to the 1 st Respondent

by the letter marked P4.

For a better appreciation of the Section 33 of the

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, under whidl

the Appellant has sought relief is reproduced here

under;

Section 33(1)

"No person shall fill any extent of paddy

land or remove any soil from any extent

of paddy land or erect any structure on

any extent of paddy land except with

the written perm1SSIOn of the Commissioner

General.

(2) any person contravenes the prov1sIOns of

su bsection ( 1) shall be guilty of an offence

under this Act.

(3) Where the Commissioner - General, or the Additional

Commissioner - General or Commissioner or Deputy

Commissioner or Assistan t Commissioner 1S informed

that any person 1S acting 1n con traven tion of

the prOV1SIOn of subsection (1) the Commissioner

General or the Additional Commissioner - General or

the Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner

may make an application In writing, su bstan tially

Therefore it is contended by the Appellants that the

1 st Respondent had failed to take any action against

4

\

j

the 3rd Respondent even after the Appellants had

informed of the unlawful act as stated above.

The 1 st and the 2nd Respondent In objecting to

the said application of the Appellants had stated

thus;

That according to the provIsIOns of the Constitution

this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine

the matter in issue.

That the Appellants had not complied with the rule

3 (1)( a) of the Court of Appeal Rules of 1990, in that

had failed to annexed all the necessary documents

material to the instant matter.

The Learned High Court Judge having heard

submissions made by both parties had arrived at the

conclusion that the provincial High Court has no

jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in hand,

mainly based on the Supreme Court judgment of

Wijesuriya .vs. Nimalawathi Wanigasinghe (S.C. Appeal

No. 33/2007)

The core issue In the instant application IS that to

decide whether the Provincial High Court is empowered

to make any order to quash any determination made,

by way of a writ of Certiorari or to compel to perform

an official act by vvay vvrit of Man darn:u.s in terms

of the sections of the Agrarian Development Act No

46 Of 2000.

Article 154 P (4) of the Constitution provides thus;

Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to

Issue, according to law ,

a. Orders In the nature of habeas ClhPllti, ill

respect of persons illegally detained within the

Province; AND

b. Oder In the nature of writs of Certiorari,

prohibition, procedendo, mandamus, and quo

warranto against any person exercIsIng, within

the Province, any power under-

1. Any law; or

2. Any statues made by the Provincial Council

established for that province

In respect of any matter set out In the

Provincial Council list.

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the

Provincial High Court is empowered to issue

an order In the nature of a writ only on

matters arIsIng within the prOVInce in respect

of any matter comIng within the Provincial

Council list.

It is also to be noted that the High of Province is

empowered to Issue writs In respect of only those matters enumerated In the Provincial Council list (1)

contained in the Ninth schedule to the 13th Amendment

to the Constitution and against any authority exercIsIng

the powers within the provInce.

The item 9 of the Provincial Council List deals with

the matters relating to Agriculture and Agrarian Services

and item 18 contains matters pertaining to LAND set

out in Appendix II.

The said item 9 enumerates thus;

"Agriculture and Agrarian Services-

9.1 Agriculture, including agricultural extension,

promotion and education for provincial purposes and

agricultural servIces (other than In interprovincial

irrigation and land settlement schemes, State land and

plantation agriculture,

9.2 -Rehabilitation and maintenance of mInor irrigation

work,

9.3- Agriculture research, save and except i:iistitlltions

designated as national agricultural research institution.

Item 18

LAND- Land that IS to say, rights In or over the

land, land tenure transfer and alienation of land, land

use, land settlement and land improvement to the

extent set out in appendix 11.

The Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the

petition of the Petitioner- Appellant on the basis that

7

I I i

f I ! i

the High Court of Province, stands denuded of

jurisdiction to issue a writ, since the same has been

observed in the case of WIJESURIYA .VS. NIMALAWATHI

WANIGASINGHE which has interpreted thus;

"While 'within' may gIve rIse to multiple

interpretations, the only reasonable interpretation In

the ligh t of the legislative history and

of Article lS4(p)(4)(b) and In deed the 13th

Amendment as a whole, IS that it refers to that

qualitative nature and scope of the power at

Issue, and not necessarily the geographic

location of the person who exercised it. In

other words the question that this 'within'

requiremen t leads us to determine IS 'Weather

the power at Issue IS one that IS local or

'provincial' In nature, or one exercised from,

or as of , a centrally acting authority or

position?

conclusive

part

And the only logical, reasonable and

determination

from a centrally

(emphasis added)

acting

IS that

authority

it IS exercised

or position."

Hence in the above interpretation of the exerCIsIng the

powers 'within' means is 'as part of, a centrally acting

authority or position'

For the above compelling reasons I am of the VIew that the Learned High Court Judge has arrived at a correct determination and as such I up hold the
