Saliya Pieris with Varuna De Seram for the accused-appellant.

ARGUED ON : 23.11.2015,

K.K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

The accused-appellant above named was indicted in the High Court of Kegalle

for committing murder of one Kiriammalawatta Lekamlage Disna Priyangika

Seneviratne at Kadugannawa on or about a day between 22nd April 1992 and 27th

April 1992 and thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 296 of

the Penal Code. Thereafter the accused-appellant was found guilty of the charge

of murder and was sentenced to death on the 3rd February 2012.

When this case was taken up for argument the learned Counsel for the appellant

pointed out that immediately after the dock statement was made by the accused-

appellant, the learned High Court Judge delivered the judgment without hearing

closing submissions of either party.

Further it was brought to the notice of Court that the learned High Court Judge

proceeded to pronounce the judgment and sentence on the same date, when the

case for the defense was closed. Therefore, it was argued that it amounts to a

violation of a right to a fair trial afforded to the accused-appellant.

After perusal of the proceedings it is evident that no time periods were noted on

the last date of proceedings. Further it is apparent from the record that this

judgment was pronounced on the same day, without giving an opportunity for

both counsel to make their submissions.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent considered the fact that

it would have been more appropriate and prudent that the learned trial Judge

should have heard the submissions of parties in support of their respective cases,

especially when the case rests entirely on circumstantial evidence.

In the case ofK.D.P. Wijesingbe Vs. Attorney General 50 CLW 32 submitted

by the learned counsel for the appellant it was held that "the pronouncement of

his verdict by the trial Judge immediately after the defense was closed, and

before the accused's Counsel could sum up his case, was a denial to the

accused, of the fundamental right of having his case summed up by his

Counsel. "

According to article 13(3) of the Constitution provides that "Any person charge

with an offence shall be entitled to be heard in person or by an Attorney-at-law,

at a fair trial by a competent Court".

..

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Aponsu [2008] BLR 145 their Lordship's

of the Supreme Court held that "The right of an accused-person to a fair trial is

recognized in all the criminal justice systems in the civilized world. Its denial is

generally proof enough that justice is denied".

This Court is of the view that the short time gap between the dock statement and

the delivery of judgment gives credence to the argument of the learned Counsel

that the learned High Court Judge did not have sufficient time to apply her mind

to the entire case and evaluate circumstantial evidence and consider the dock

statement given by the accused-appellant when considering the case of the

defense.

In the case of Sarath Amunugama and Others Vs. Karu Jayasooriya and Others

quoting the King Vs. Sussex Justices ex-party McCarthy [1924]1KB 256 at

page 259 held that public confidence in the settlement in dispute "Public

confidence in the settlement of disputes requires that even in so called "open

and shut" cases the principles of natural justice must be observed so as to

ensure not only that justice was done but also, ... that it should be "manifestly

and undoubtedly be seen to be done. "

In the case of W.R.M. Chamila Wijesinghe and Another Vs. Attorney

General CA 206-207/2007 it was held thus "The judges must be concerned

about the rule of law and the principals of a fair trial, protection of their interest

should be at the forefront of their minds ".

Therefore, considering all above I set aside the conviction and the sentence

imposed on the accused-appellant and order re-trial against the appellant on the

same indictment.
