CASE - NO - CA. 168/07 - ORDER - 24/05/ 2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The Petitioner has by

Revisionary jurisdiction

the following relief.

this application invoked the

of this Court and moved for

In that she moves to amend the final partition

scheme in the case No. 2163/ P and moves for the

allocation of lot 3 of the Final scheme of partition,

to her as some valuable permanent buildings are

within the said block of land.

It IS submitted by the Petitioner that the 4th

Respondent through the Fiscal had got the writ

executed on 09.07.2008, although a copy of the

reVlSlOn application was sent to the 4th Respondent.

Further it

Respondent,

IS alleged by the Petitioner that the 4th

immediately after taking possession of the

4

said lot had erected a barbed WIre fence right across

the petitioner's buildings in which the petitioner and

her son-in-law were carrying on business.

For the above application of the Petitioner, only the

4A Respondent has raised objection as stated below;

That the Petitioner made an application to Court on

16th February 2005 and had objected to the final

partition scheme on the ground that there was no ,/"'---~ allotted 00ad frontage to Lot to her in the final

partition plan 2887 dated 25.07.2001 made by

B. Abeyratne the commlSSlOner.

It is to be noted that the trial in this case has

been decided without the parties and only in the

presence of the Plaintiff. Further it is brought to the

notice of Court that the lot No. 3 is allotted to the

4th Respondent in the Final Partition plan No. 2887.

But the Petitioner is now claiming the buildings

standing thereon. It is also contended by the

Respondent that the said purported buildings allegedly

had been constructed by the 3rd Defendant were not

in existence at the time of the preliminary survey.

In addition it is contended by the 4th Respondent

that the petitioner cannot by this present application

move this Court to set aside the final decree of the said partition action mentioned herein Lefort:.

5

f I

The Counsel for the 4th Respondent has adverted this

Court to the fact that although the Petitioner has

made this application in revision has not shown any

exceptional circumstances which warrants the exerCIse

of the discretionary remedy.

Hence In the above setting 4th Respondent urges

that a dismissal of the Petitioner's application, and

the final plan No. 2887 dated 25.07.2001, which IS

already confirmed and the final decree entered by the

Learned District Judge be affirmed.

In the said back drop the 4th Respondent had

raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability

of the petitioner's application to set aside the Final

Partition decree.

According to the final scheme of partition of the

land sought to be partitioned and which IS more fully

depicted In the final partition plan No. 2887 Lot No.

3 had been allotted to the 4th Respondent, and the

3rd Defendant was allotted lot No 4 In the afore

said final partition plan.

The gravamen of the 4th Respondent's argument lS

that the Petitioner has failed to aver exceptional

circumstances which warrants the exercIse of the

reVIsIOnary powers of this Court to grant the relives which the petitioner has prayed for.

6

As a comprehensive response to the afore said

contention Petitioner states thus;

That In parti tion action the revlslOnary

not exercised on the basis of

circumstances' but when there IS a

powers are

'exceptional

substantive

miscarriage of justice has occurred In the process, the

Court could exerCIse the same.

Further it IS been noted that Section 48 (4) of the

Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 provides for the exerCIse

of revisionary powers.

Section 48(4) states thus;

(a) Whenever a party to a partition action;

(i) Has not been served with summons, or

(ii) Being a mInor or a person of unsound

mind, has not been duly represented by a

guardian ad litem, or

(iii) Dies before judgment IS entered and no

substitution of his heirs or legal

representatives has been made or no person

has been appointed to represent the estate of

the deceased party for the purpose of the

action, or

(iv) Being a party who has duly filed his

statement of claim and registered his address, fails to appear at the trial,

7

And in consequence thereof the right, title or interest of

such party to or in the land which forms the subject

- matter of the interlocutory decree entered 1n such

action has been extinguished or such party has been

otherwise prejudiced by the interlocutory decree, such

party or where such party 1S a m1nor or a person

of unsound mind, a person appointed as guardian ad

litem of such party, or the heirs or the executor or

administrator of such deceased party or any person

duly appointed to represent the estate of the

deceased party, may at any time, not later than

thirty days after the date on which the return of

the surveyor under section 32 or the return of the

person responsible for the sale under section 42, as the

case may be, 1S received by the court, apply to the

court for special leave to establish the right, title or

interest of such party to or 1n the said land

notwithstanding the interlocutory decree already entered.

In order to su bstan tiate the said position the

Petitioner has cited the case mentioned here under;

In SOMAWATHI .VS. MADAWELA- has expressed thus;

"the pronouncement of Sansoni C.J. 1n regard to the

revisionary powers of the Court in Mariam Beebee .vs.

Seyed Mohomed -therefore remruns applicable even

after the enactment of the Administration of justice

(Amendment) Law No. 25 of 1975 and Partition Law

No 2i of 1977. The powers of rev1sIOns and

restitution In integrum have survived all the legislation

that has been enacted up to date. These are the

extraordinary powers and will be exercised only in a

fit to avert . . of justice. The case a mlscarnage

immunity gIVen to the partition decrees from being

assailed on the grounds of omlSSlOns and defects of

procedure as now broadly defined and of the failure

to make persons concerned parties to the action

should not be interpreted as a licence to flout the

prOVlSlOns of the Partition Law. The Court wlll not

hesitate to use its revlslOnary powers to give relief

where a miscarriage of justice has occurred".

The Petitioner has adverted the following facts which

created irregularity in the procedure.

That the matter was taken up for trial and the 3rd

Defendant had framed issues and case was postponed

for 02.06.1978, on which date the case was taken off

the trial due to the death of a party.

It IS said

through out

was to be

an openIng

called on

26.02.1999.

that the

and on

called, was

ceremony

that date

3rd Defendant was present

20.11.98 being th*= !lex~ dHte

not called as there has been

and the cases that were to be

was listed to be called on

On 26.02.1999 none of the parties were present and

the trial was fixed for 07.09.1999, and the notice

had been issued by way of substituted service.

9

On 07 / 09 / 1999 trial was held In the absence of the

Defendants but the Plaintiff was present and the

learned District Judge has entered the judgment on

16.12.1999.

Therefore it IS alleged by the Petitioner that the

procedure adopted by the Learned District Judge IS a

violation of the proper procedure, as the case was

heard without proper notice to all parties

In addition it IS said that the petitioner who IS the

wife of the deceased the 3rd defendant was substituted

even after the final Partition plan was confirmed.

The Petitioner also contended that while the partition

action was In progress the parties had en tered in

to a amicable settlement and had developed their

respective lots accordingly. The purported judgment too

has clearly stated the fact that as far as possible to

allocate the shares to the parties the way In which

they possessed. But it IS alleged by the Petitioner

that the surveyor has not carried out the said

direction, by not allocating the land In which the

Petitioner's buildings were, to the Petitioner.

The petitioner further averred that although the 4th

Respondent had objected to the final scheme of

partition, later had not objected as she became aware that all the valuable buildings were included to

her lot No 3 by the final partition plan.

I~ Hence In the afore said circumstances it abundantly y--

/'L clear that substantive . . mlscarnage of justice has been

caused to the petitioner which could be cured only

by invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

Therefore In the said backdrop this court IS of the

view that the preliminary objection raised by the 4th

Respondent IS devoid of merits and should stand

overruled.

Objection IS overruled.
