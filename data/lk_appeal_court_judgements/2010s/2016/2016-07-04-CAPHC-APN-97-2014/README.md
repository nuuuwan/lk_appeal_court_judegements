The petitioner states that an indictment had been forwarded against him and another

and was ordered to pay a state cost of Rs.1500/- with a surety bond of Rs.sO, 000/- to

be of good behavior, further he was also ordered to pay Rs.100, 000/- to the Victim's

parents. He further the states that he did not receive any summons with regards to the

case in which he had been convicted and had no knowledge of the pendency of the

said case. Until he learnt about the convictions. 1st accused had been convicted upon

being tried in absentia in terms of Sec 241(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Counsel for the accused-petitioner submits that the Learned High Court Judge has

rejected the petition of appeal of the accused petitioner. He also submits that this is a

statutory right available to the accused. Senior State Counsel appearing for the

respondent submits that as the appeal has been filed on time he has no objections and

consent for judgement in favour of the accused-petitioner.

Counsel for the accused-petitioner further submits the following case law in support of

his application. Vide Dadimuni Indrasena Vs. Attorney General CA Appeal No.

13/2002 and Sudharman De Silva Vs. Attorney General S.C. Appeal No. 45/85. Held -

Section 14 of the Judicature Act has specifically endowed an accused who is convicted

with a substantive right of appeal and this right of appeal cannot be taken away from

him on the ground that he had been acting contumaciously or in defiance of the law.

Contumacious conduct on the part of an accused is relevant only where the exercise of

a discretion vested in the court is involved. Here the right of appeal is statutory and

can be asserted as of right by the accused although he had jumped bail and was

absconding at the trial.

In Ukkubandage Thilakarathne Vs. OIC Kakirawa CA 346/81

"Any person who stands convicted of any offence by the High Court may appeal

therefrom to the Court of Appeal"
