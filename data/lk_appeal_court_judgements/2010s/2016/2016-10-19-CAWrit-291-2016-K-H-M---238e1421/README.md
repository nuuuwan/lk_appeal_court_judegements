Before: Vijith K. Malalgoda P.C. J (PICA)

Counsel: Upul Ranga Hewage with Mrs. Gothami Weerasekara for the

Petitioner.

Argued & Decided on: 15.09.2016.

Vijith K. Malalgoda P.C. J (PICA)

The accused-petitioners have come before this Court against a land

settlement order made in the year 2008. The petitioner's position before this

Court is that the land they were in occupation was settled by the Department

of Land Settlement against one K.H.M. Dharmasena. The said land settlement

certificate is produced by the petitioners marked PI0 and I observed that the

said settlement was first made on 23.07.2008. As revealed before us the said

Dharmasena had filed action in the District Court and during the said action

the land settlement certificate referred to in PI0 had been produced as far

back as in 2012. As observed by this Court the 2nd Petitioner's son who was

in occupation of the land has litigated this matter and they have finally gone

up to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court had refused Special Leave .

.u.u<. Failing their efforts in the said action the 2nd petitioner the mother offperson~

who was a party to the said District Court action and the 1 st petitioner who is

the brother of the 2nd petitioner are now coming before this Court challenging

the basic document under which the said actions were decided, i.e. the land

settlement certificate. It is further observed by this Court that the said land

settlement certificate was issued far back as year 2008 but the petitioner

submit that they were only aware of this certificate since 2012. The

petitioners have taken four years to come before this Court to challenge this

certificate. The petitioners failed to explain their delay before this Court.

I further observed that the Land Commissioners Department in the year 2015

had made the final settlement order under Section 5(5) of the Land Settlement

Ordinance.

Considering the fact that the Petitioners had failed to explain the delay

before this Court and the final settlement order had now been made under

Section 5(5) of the Land Settlement Ordinance, this Court is not inclined to

interfere with the said order and therefore I refuse the notice in this

application. Application is accordingly dismissed. No cost is ordered.

Application dismissed.
