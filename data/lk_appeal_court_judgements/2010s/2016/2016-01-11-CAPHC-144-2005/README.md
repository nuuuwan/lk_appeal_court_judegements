CASE - NO - CA (PHC) 144/2005 - JUDGMENT - 15.12.2015

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal lodged by the Petitioner - Appellant (in short the

Appellant) is sequent to an order made by the Learned High Court

Judge by refusing to Issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the order

of the 4th Respondent.

The facts stated herein below has emerged from the Petition of

the Petitioner lodged in the Provincial High Court holden at

Negombo.

That the father of the Petitioner became entitled to the land

more fully described in the schedule to the Petition by virtue of

Deed No. 323 dated 16th June 1956.

That the Petitioner became entitled to the said land by virtue of

Deed No. 1547, dated 27.04.1994 and deed bearing No. 583, dated

26 of January 1999.

The dispute pertaining to the instant appeal arust: <lut: LV a

complaint made by the 1 st Respondent, of an obstruction caused

by the Petitioner by not allowing the 1 st Respondent to use the

path which leads to the thrashing floor.

The 4th Respondent having inquired In to the complaint made

by the 1 st Respondent had made order, that the Petitioner should

remove all the obstructions to the path leading to the threshing

floor. The said order has been marked as P5.

The Petitioner appealed against the said order, to the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development, and the said

4

l

order was stayed by the said Commissioner General. However

no InqUIry was held In respect of the appeal by Petitioner,

but the 4th Respondent acting In terms of Section 90 of the

Agrarian Development Act had ordered the 5th Respondent to

enforce the alleged order marked P5.

The above said order of the 4th Respondent IS marked as P5.

Being aggrieved by the above said order marked as P5 the

Petitioner moved for a mandate In the of a writ of

Certiorari, to quash the decision of the 4th Respondent,

and to Issue a writ of Prohibition to stay the enforcement

of order marked as P16.

In addition to the afore said the Petitioner stated, that the

disputed threshing floor has not been used for threshing

paddy for the last ten years, and In the subject land he

had cultivated vegetables. Further it IS said that the

Respondent has an alternative

floor.

path to go to the threshing

Further it IS asserted by the Petitioner that the disputed land

IS a private land, and not a State land.

The 3, 4 & 5th Respondents has stated In their objections

that investigation notes reveals the existence of a roadway

to the threshing floor.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts

placed before Court has dismissed the Petitioners application

mOVIng for the said reliefs.

5

In considering the Issuance of a Writ of Certiorari the

Learned High Court Judge had adverted to the case of

JAYAWERA .VS. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF AGRARIAN

SERVICES - 1996 - 2 SLR - 70.

It was held thus;

"A Petitioner who IS seeking relief In an application for issue

of Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of

course, as a matter of right or as discretion to deny him

relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waIver,

submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments which stand

against the relief."

The Learned High Court Judge, in dealing with allegation made

by the Petitioner as to the, failure on the part of the 4th

Respondent for not affording an opportunity for the Petitioner

to place his case, was of the view, that Petitioner was given

on two occaSIOns to participate In the InqUIry, which he has

failed to do so. In addition it IS said that the Petitioner

was aware of the fact that a determination will be reached

on 25.06.2002 by document marked P6(E) and by document

marked P5 the 4th Respondent has conveyed his determination,

to the Petitioner on 29.01.2003.

It is salient to note that the Petitioner has applied to the

Provincial High Court for reliefs stated above only on

30.01.2004, expiration of 1 year after the said determination.

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge was of the VIew

that the Petitioner has come before the High Court with

6

an undue delay, and had failed to gIve reasonable

to the said delay.

explanation

The above principle was enshrined In the case of

DISSANA YAKE .VS. FERNANDO - 71 -NLR - 356 which has held

thus;

"Where there has been delay In seeking relief by way of

Certiorari, it IS essential that the reasons for the delay

should be set out in the papers filed In the Supreme

Court."

Hence the Petitioner IS guilty of laches and the Learned

High Court Judge was of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to this discretionary remedy.

To fortify the said proposition the Learned High Court has

also considered the case of PRESIDENT OF MALALGODAPITIY A

CO - OPERATIVE SOCIETY .VS. ARBITRATOR OF CO -

OPERATIVE SOCIETIES, GALLE - 51 - NLR - 167 it was held that;

"A writ of Certiorari will not be issued where there has

been undue delay in applying for the writ."

In the said back drop the Leaned High Court Judge was of

the VIew that the Petitioner has not taken necessary action

against the decision as per document ma!'ked P5 v/ith due

diligence and without an inordinate delay.

Hence in the above setting the Learned High Court Judge,

hand down an order dated 29.01.2003, dismissing the application

of the Petitioner.

; ! I 1I!It

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner - Appellant (in

short the Appellant) lodged the instant appeal and sought for

the reliefs inter alia;

To have the order of the Learned High Court Judge to be

set aside, and for the same reliefs, claimed in the High Court

of Negambo.

The counsel for the 3rd, 4th & 6th Respondents had tendered

written submissions and asserted the following.

That the 4th Respondent had gIven adequate notice to the

Petitioner to be present at the InqUIry, but had failed to do

so. Therefore the Petitioner cannot now alleged that the 4th

Respondent has not observed the rules of natural

T ___ ..... ~ __ Dy-J u:stl~~,

Petitioner not being heard In the afore said InqUIry.

The Counsel for the Respondents has adverted Court to the

case of APPUHAMY .VS. HETTIARACHCHI - 77 NLR - 131 which

has expressed thus;

"the necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material

facts to be placed before the Court when an application for

a writ or injunction is made and the process of the Court

IS invoked IS laid down ...... "

Therefore it IS abundantly clear that the Petitioner has

misrepresented the material facts, and there by had disqualified

her self for this discretionary remedy.

..

Further the Respondents had stressed the fact that Petitioner is

guilty of laches and as such is not entitled to the reliefs

claimed In the prayer to the petition.

It IS being observed that an undue delay will be a ground

for dismissal of a writ application. It was so held, In the

case of HULANGAMUW A . VS. SIRIWARDENE -(1986) 1 SLR

-275.

Hence for the reasons stated herein before this Court IS of the

VIew that the Petitioner - Appellant's appeal IS devoid of merits

and should stand dismissed.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed without costs.
