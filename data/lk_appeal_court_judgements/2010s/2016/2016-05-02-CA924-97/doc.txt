The plaintiff respondent filed a partition case in the District Court

Tangalle to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint. After trial

the learned District Judge had delivered his findings answering the issues of

the respondent allowing the partition as prayed for by the plaintiff respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 10109/1997 the defendant-

appellant has preferred the instant application.

The appellant stated that the learned District Judge failed to examine

the title in terms of section 25 (A) of the Partition Act (as amended). The

appellant citing the judgment in Piyaseeli vs Mendis and others (2003) 3

SLR 273 said that the main function of the trial judge in a partition action is to

investigate title.

The appellant stated that the respondent failed to establish the title of

Jayathu Hamy who is said to be the original owner and that the District Judge

has erred when he answered the first issue in the affirmative.

The appellant citing the judgment in Jane Nona vs

Dingirimahathmaya 74 NLR 105 said that in a partition action the plaintiff

had to set out the devolution of title fully.

The respondent argued that the original owner of the corpus was

Ubeysinghe Arachchige Jayathuhamy and that he had two children namely

Appu and Jane and that the plaintiff respondent's title was thereupon very

clearly stated in the plaint and as well as in evidence, and invited court to

examine the evidence of J.G. Soun Hamy who marked the death certificate of

Sedarahamy as P3 which proved the plaintiffs chain of title. Plaintiff also has

marked as P2 the death certificate of Ubesinghe Arachchige Charlis which

also tallied with the plaintiff's chain of title. The respondent submitted that by

these two documents and the evidence the plaintiff respondent proved their

chain of title which the learned District Judge very correctly accepted.

The respondent stated that the District Judge had enough documentary

evidence and had a clear picture of the plaintiffs pedigree.

On perusal of the arguments submitted and also the documents and \

J I

the District Judge's judgment it can be seen that the District Judge who heard

the evidence and observed the witness giving evidence had very correctly

! analysed and investigated the pedigree and the title of the plaintiff.

\

As stated by the appellant in Piyaseeli vs Mendis and others (2003) 3

SLR 273 it is the main function of the trial judge in a partition action to

investigate the title and is a necessary prerequisite to every partition action

and the learned District Judge has done this very correctly.

5

As stated in Jane Nona vs Dingiri Mahathaya 74 NLR 105 which

case the appellant cited the plaintiff had set out his title fully.

For the afore stated reasons I see no reason to vacate a well

considered judgment given by the learned District Judge. The appeal of the

appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

M.M.A. Gaffor J.

I agree.
