In this Appeal the 2nd Party Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) challenge the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Badulla, dated 27.02.2004 allowing a Revision Application by setting aside

the determination of the learned Primary Court Judge, under Chapter VII of

the Primary Court Procedure Act.

When the Appeal was taken up for argument on 11.12.2015 the

learned Counsel for the 1 st Party - Petitioner - Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondents) raised the following preliminary objections

as to the maintainability of this Appeal.

(i) The Appellants have failed to comply with Rule 4 (2) of the

Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from High Court

established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules 1998.

(ii) The prayer of the Petition of Appeal is defective as the

Appellants have not prayed for a dismissal of the reVISIOn

application filed before the Provincial High Court.

The Counsel for the Respondents submitted that, as required by Rule

4(2) of the Court of Appeal Rules, the purported Petition of Appeal has not

been forwarded to this Court and therefore, the purported Petition of Appeal

should be rejected in limine.

In view of the above objections the Court decided without going into

the matters raised in the Petition, to inquire into the question in view of the

said issue whether the Appellant can proceed or not with this Application.

It is relevant to note although it was agreed by both parties to file

written submissions on the question of the preliminary objections that relates

to the maintainability of this action, written submissions has been filed only

on behalf of the Respondents.

I will now tum to consider the legal position of the preliminary

objections which were raised by the Counsel for the Respondents.

The Court of Appeal Rule 4 (1) and 4 (2) reads as follows:-

~

1 1 1 I I ! ! I

I

4 (1) Every petition of appeal shall state shortly the grounds of appeal

and shall be signed by the appellant or his Attorney-at-Law.

4 (2) Where the appeal is on a matter of law the petition shall contain

a statement of the matter of law to be argued and shall bear a

certificate by an Attorney-at-Law that such matter of law is a fit

question for adjudication by the Court of Appeal.

It is relevant to note as per Rule 4 (1), every Petition of Appeal shall

state shortly the grounds of appeal. Even though it is stated in paragraph (3)

of the Petition of Appeal, that the Order of the learned High Court Judge is

unlawful and illegal for the reasons stated in subsequent paragraph, it is

relevant to note that no reasons are stated in the subsequent paragraph.

Apart from that, according to the Rule 14 (1) (e) of the Court of

Appeal Rules in the petition shall contain a plain and concise statement of

the grounds of objection to the order appealed against such statements to be

set forth in duly numbered paragraphs.

The Appellant has not complied with Rule 4 (1) and 14 (1) (e) either

of the Court of Appeal Rules.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents contended that since this

appeal has preferred upon a matter of law, the Appellants have to state the

matters of law on which they canvas the Order of the learned High Court

Judge and also a certificate by an Attorney-at-Law stating that those are fit

and proper matters to be adjudicated by the Court of Appeal.

I am of the view since the Appellants have not stated any matters of

law in the Petition of Appeal, question of bearing a certificate by an

I

r

~ II

t 1

i 9

Attorney-at-Law in the Petition does not arise. However, it is to be noted

that the Appellants have not complied with Rule 4 (1) of the Court of Appeal

Rules.

It is relevant to note that the Appellants have not complied with Rule

14 (1) (a) of the Court of Appeal Rules. It says, the Petition of Appeal shall

contain the name of the Court in which the application is pending. At the

top of the petition it is mentioned as tI@ @ot::D) gO)Q)eDQJt::D t:j@Jde)~

oev6d@c5 ~cneX~))G.)t::D6fID@~W. C'fJe) a)tD~e, ~s @e5))G.)t::D6fID@~W." and

it cannot be considered as the name of the Court in which the application is

pending.

Furthermore, it is vital to note, that in the recital of the Petition of

Appeal it is mentioned as follows:-

"@ ot::D) oev6d@c5 t:j@Jde)~ oev6d@c5 q)~@@ e);aooc)@e) 1545))

e)(5)eD63w t:j@((5) t5)~@e)ev 1990 qot::D 19 e,6fID a)tD~e, @e5))G.)t::D6fID@c5 e)@~ e)G.)

e)C))ev aev@tD 5 e)ev e)(5)eD63w w()@tD t::D6@ ~ev g63@(5;))C)ev qws@"

Hence, the Appellants have not complied with the Rule 14 (1) (a) of

the Court of Appeal Rules as well.

Hence, I am of the view that there is no proper Petition of Appeal and

the Appellants have not properly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

The next objection which arises for decision is whether the prayer of

the Petition of Appeal is defective. In the written submissions filed in this

Court by the Respondents, it was contended that the Appellants have only

prayed to set aside the order dated 27.02.2004 of the learned High Court

Judge by prayer (a) and (b) of the Petition; but not prayed for a dismissal of

I

iII

J

the revision application filed in the High Court nor prayed to affirm the

Order of the Primary Court.

Since the main relief which have been sought by the Appellants is, to

set aside the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge and if this Court

decides this appeal in favour of the Appellants, the Order of the learned

Magistrate would prevail. Therefore, I am of the view it is not essential to

pray for dismissal of the Revision Application.

However, it has been held over and over again by this Court as well as

the Supreme Court, non-compliance with the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules is fatal to the application. The importance and the

mandatory nature of the observance of the Rules of the Court of Appeal in

presenting an application has been repeatedly emphasised, and discussed in a

long line of decided authorities by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme

Court.

In the case of Coomasaru vs. Mis. Leechman and Co. Ltd., and Three

Others, Tennekoon C.J. stated as follows:

"Rules of procedure must not always be regarded as mere

technicalities which parties can ignore at their whim and pleasure". In that

case, the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the Respondents that

relates to the non-compliance of Rules upheld and dismissed the case.

It was held in Nicholas vs. Macan Markar Ltd., (1981) 2 S L R 1, non

compliance with the Rules which is in imperative terms would render such

application liable to be rejected.

Justice Soza stated in Nava Rathnasingham vs. Arumugam and

Another (1980) 2 S L R 1 "This petition therefore should have been rejected

for non-compliance with Rules". Further he stated that the Supreme Court

Rules are imperative and should be complied with.

Same decision was followed in the case of Rashid Ali vs. Mohamed

Ali (1981) 2 S L R 29. It was held in Shanmugadivu vs. Kulatilake (2003)

1 S L R 215, the requirements of Rules are imperative and the Court of

Appeal had no discretion to excuse the failure to comply with the Rules.

The Petition of Appeal by the Appellants in this case has not been

directed to the proper forum under the proper provision of law in as much as

no proper legally tenable appeal is pending. Therefore, my considered view

is that the Appellant has not invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in a proper

manner complying with the Rule 4 (2) and 14 (1) (e) of the Court of Appeal

Rules.

F or the reasons stated above I uphold the first preliminary objection

raised by the learned Counsel for the Respondents.

This Appeal is dismissed accordingly subject to costs.
