P.R.Walgama, J

The instant Revision application lies against the

order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

10.02.2015, wherein the custodial sentence was

imposed on the 1 st Accused - Petitioner.

The 1 st Accused Petitioner, along with another (2nd

Accused) was arraigned on the following coun ts In

the High Court of Ratnapura.

1. On a date between 01.01.2012 and 31.01.2012 at

Iriyandaluwa within the jurisdiction of this Court

the 1 st Accused having the custody or care of

2

Balangoda Ranaweerage Dilshani Niroshima

Chandrasena a child under eighteen years of age

acted in a manner likely to cause the said child

suffering or injury to health by wilfully assaulting,

ill-treating, and neglecting the said child to wit

assaulting and not providing food the said child

did commit the offence of cruelty to children

punishable under Section 308 A of the Penal Code

as amended by Penal Code (Amendment) Act No.

22 of 1995.

The 2 nd Accused too was charged with the same

count, and both accused on a subsequent occaSlOn

pleaded guilty to the respective charges, and the

Learned High Court Judge convicted the said

accused and imposed the following sentence.

The 1st accused was sentenced to turo y~8'!"S

ngorous imprisonment, and a fine of Rs. 1000/

carryIng a default sentence of 3 months.

The 2nd accused was sentenced to two years

imprisonment suspended for 05 years. In addition

State Cost Rs. 5000/ carryIng a default sentence of

3 months and further a sum of Rs 100,000/ to be

paid to the victim, carrying a default sentence of 1

year.

The above Section 308 A extracts thus;

3

(2) "Whoever commits the offence of cruelty to

children shall on conviction be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term not

less than two years and not extending ten years

and may also be punished with fine and be ordered

to pay compensation of an amount determined by

court to the person in respect of whom the offence

was committed for the InJunes caused to such

person."

Therefore it

High Court

IS abundantly clear that the Learned

Judge has used his discretion and

imposed the mInImum jail term in respect of the 1st

Accused - Appellant.

Nevertheless it IS the

the Appellant that for

contention of the Counsel for

the reasons averred In the

petition the said custodial sentence be commuted to

a suspended sentence.

In pleading In mitigation it IS said that the

Appellant IS the first offender, and In considering

the afore said it IS said that the sentence imposed

on him IS excessIve, and to buttress the above

position the

many decided

court should

Appellan t has adverted this court to

cases, but it IS worthy to note the

always be cautious when releasing a

wrongdoer to the society.

In the instant matter it IS common ground that the

Accused - Appellant has left his wife and was living

4

(i

with the 2nd Accused, the victim and her brother. It

IS the position of the Appellant that his son IS

under a mental trauma due to his absence from

home. In proof of the above condition the Appellant

has produced two documents to this court, which

should not be taken In to consideration at this

stage.

It IS intensely relevant to note that Accused-

Appellant has failed to exerCIse the right of appeal

but decided to come by way of Revision.

The Counsel for Respondent has submitted that the

Petitioner to invoke the Revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court he should establish the existence of

exceptional circumstances, which warrants the exerCIse

of the same. Therefore it IS contended by the

counsel for the Respondent that the Petitioner has

not gIVen a valid reason for the failure to exerCIse

his statutory right of appeal. In the above setting it

IS contended for the Respondent the instant reVISIOn

application should necessarily fail. Further it IS

asserted by the counsel for the Respondent that

there had not been a substantial . . mlscarnage of

justice caused to the Accused - Appellant.

To cap it all, the Appellant has not assailed the

said, sentence, but only has stated about his sons

condition as a reason for mitigation.

In arnving at determination this Court is mindful of

the fact that Appellan t was a father who was living

with 2nd Accused, the mistress, and while the victim

was under his care has ill-treated the victim.

Therefore considering the factual

stated herein before this court is

and legal matrix

of the VIew that

there IS no reason to vary the sen tence which was

imposed by the Learned High Court Judge, thus the

Petitioner's application is dismissed without costs.

Accordingly the petition is dismissed.
