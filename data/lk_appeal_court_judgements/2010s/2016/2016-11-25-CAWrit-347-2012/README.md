The Petitioner invoked the Writ Jurisdiction of this court seeking:

a. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 2nd

Respondent dated 05.04.2012.

b. A Writ of Mandamus Directing the 1S\ 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondents to implement the recommendations and

directions contained in the documents marked PI, P9, P10,

P12 and P13 amongst other reliefs.

The Petitioner had joined ComputerLand (PVT) Ltd. as an Assistant

Stock keeper in 1991 and had risen in the ranks to eventually become the

General Manager. His services were then terminated by his employer.

Subsequently the Petitioner has filed an application in the Labour

Tribunal and subsequent to an exparte inquiry being held, the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rupees

900,000/-as compensation to the Petitioner by the order dated

06.06.2007 as evidenced by the document produced marked Pl.

According to the Document produced marked PI by the 1st to 4th

Respondents, the winding up proceedings were commenced against

ComputerLand (PVT) Ltd. on 26th September 2005 based on a Petition

presented by H.T.N Information Systems (PVT) Ltd.

The president of the Labour Tribunal has stated in his order dated

06.06.2007 that ComputerLand (PVT) Ltd. was under liquidation.

Therefore, this court is of the view that the Tribunal didn't have

Jurisdiction to entertain the application in view of the provisions of

Section 264 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 which reads as

follows:

"When a Winding-Up order has been made, or a provisional

liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding shall be

proceeded with or commenced against the Company except by

leave of the Court and subject to such terms as court may impose."

The Petitioner has produced Winding-Up proceedings dated 25.02.2011

marked P14 but has suppressed the fact that those proceedings were

instituted on 26.09.2005. This application can be dismissed on that

ground alone.

In view of Section 264 of the Companies Act the 2nd Respondent is

estopped from filing proceedings in the Magistrates Court to recover the

dues from ComputerLand (PVT) Ltd. under the Employees' Provident

Fund Act No.15 of 1998.

It was held in East West Research & Design (PVT) Ltd. V.

Weerakoon Commissioner of Labour 1993 ISLR 191 that: "The bar

imposed by Section 264 can only be removed by the Court before which

the Winding -Up is pending."

However the 2nd Respondent has intervened in the Winding-Up

proceeding in case No. 186/CO by submitting an affidavit as evidenced

by the document produced marked R3. It appears from the proceedings

that those dues were not settled in full due to the inefficiency of funds.

This court is of the view that the main relief sought by the Petitioner

cannot be granted as he has failed to produce the decision alleged to

have been made by the 2nd Respondent on 05.04.2012 for the perusal of

the court.

This court now moves to deal with the contents of the Documents

marked P9, PI0, P12 and P13 respectively.

P9 is a response by the 1st Respondent to the parliamentary Advisory

Committee dated 05.09.2008 and does not contain any recommendation

or a direction and therefore this Court cannot grant any relief

considering the same. However, P9 indicates that the claim is included

as a liability in the Winding-Up proceedings in Case No. 186/CO.

PI0 contains certain recommendations of the Human Rights

Commission and no Statutory Duty is conferred upon the Respondents

to implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Commission.

P12 and P13 are letters addressed to the Secretary to the President by the

Director General of the Presidential Investigation Unit. As the Secretary

to the President is not a party to this application this court is unable to

make any order pertaining to P12 and P13.

This court holds that the application is misconceived in Law as none of

the mandates sought by the Petitioner can be issued.

For the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed.
