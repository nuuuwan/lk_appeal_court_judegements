Having dropped SI Tennakoon, PC Senarathne and the informant around 8.10 A.M, near the

Negambo bound bus halt in Totalanga, he remained inside the vehicle with the other officers near a

tea packing factory. At 8.35 A.M he received a massage from SI Tennakoon over the communication

set that the relevant person was shown by the informant. Having instructed SI Tennakoon to release

the informant, he advised the two officers to detain the suspect, and rushed to the bus halt within 1-1

Vz minutes. When he tried to search the suspect, the suspect obstructed search by spitting at him.

Witness had to use the minimum force to control the suspect and thereafter searched him. Upon

searching the suspect he recovered a cellophane bag containing some powder from his trouser

pocket. Having questioned the suspect, the police party visited the house of the Accused-Appellant

and searched the place but nothing incriminatory was recovered from his house. Thereafter the

police party return to the Police Narcotic Bureau along with the suspect and after identification and

weighing, the productions were sealed and entered in the Production Register under PR 33 and duly

handed over to the production officer by 10.40 hours.

According to SI Tennakoon, on the instructions of IP Kumaratunga he took part in this raid along

with PC Senarathne and several other police officers. When they left Police Narcotic Bureau, PS 841

Upali's informant was also with them. On the instructions he received from IP Kumaratunga he got

down at Totalanga with PC Senarathne and the informant and walked up to a bus stand. At that time

the informant pointed out the suspect who was standing inside a bus stand on the other side of the

road. After informing this to IP Kumaratunga, on his instructions witness first released the

informant, and crossed the road along with PC Senarathne and walked up to the suspect. When the

witness tried to arrest the suspect after informing him that the witness is from Police Narcotic

Bureau, the suspect protested by throwing sand at the witness but he manage to detain the suspect

until IP Kumaratunga reached the bus stand. However when IP Kumaratunga tried to search him the

suspect spitted at the IP Kumaratunga and obstructed the search. After using minimum force to

witnesses have corroborated each other and no major contradictions were observed in their evidence.

Whilst referring to the said paragraph the position taken up by the Learned Counsel was that the

case against the Appellant is proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the said approach followed by the

Learned Trial Judge is erroneous.

The learned Trial Judge after considering the evidence led by the prosecution up to page 15 of his

judgment (page 296 of the brief) evaluated the said evidence along with the position taken up by the

Accused during the prosecution case.

After considering the said evidence, up to page 17 of his judgment (page 298 of the brief) he had

recorded the impugned paragraph before considering the defence evidence. Immediately thereafter

the Learned Trial Judge considered the defence evidence as follows,

"@@ q~E) c)d6)@Cl63 cg>~ood t:J)O~ @d~ c.:m:;::iW c3363 0l<!lm@@@ c.J)~ O) c.Jlt:J)Clo)

t:J)@@ ......... "(page 18 of his judgment - page 299 of the brief).

When considering the flow of events followed by the Learned Trial Judge, what is important is

whether the Learned Trial Judge was mindful and given due consideration to the defence case before

coming to a conclusion. The terminology he used is not important at this stage, but it is very much

clear, from the flow of events followed by the Learned Trial Judge that, what he meant at that stage

was that the "prosecution has made out a prima fascia case." Otherwise there is no necessacity for

him to consider the defence case immediately thereafter before arriving at the conclusion. Therefore

I see no merit in the said argument.

The Learned Trial Judge has not rejected the evidence given on oath.

Once again the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant had relied upon another paragraph of the

judgment in isolation and based his argument solely on the said paragraph.

Counsel has drawn our attention to the following passage and argued that the Learned Trial Judge

had not rejected the defence case.

judgment, page 306 of the brief)

However the Learned Counsel has not considered the judgment from pages 18-25 when placing the

said argument before this court. I observe that the Learned Trial Judge had carefully analyzed the

defence evidence, i.e. the evidence of the Accused-Appellant, his wife Fathima Shafid, Dr. Buddika

Weerasundera and considered the evidentially value of each witness and rejected the positions taken

up by the lay witnesses by giving reasons and also considered the extent to which the medical

evidence can be accepted, when considering the same with the evidence of the Accused-Appellant,

before concluding that the defence had failed to create a doubt on the prosecution case during the

defence case.

Therefore I observe that the Learned Counsel had once again challenged the terminology used by the

trial judge in this instance without giving due consideration to the trouble the trial judge had taken to

consider each aspect of the defence case in his judgment. I therefore reject the second argument

raised by the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant.

No significance was attached or addressed to material infirmities in the prosecution case,

As the third ground of appeal the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant raised several

infirmities in the judgment. Firstly he argued that the Learned Trial Judge had failed to give due

consideration to the mistake admitted by witness Kumaratunga in his evidence with regard to his

notes. During the evidence the said witness admitted that by mistake he has recorded that the

information he received was from an informant of SI Tennakoon instead of PS Upali but submitted

that he had corrected that fact in his detailed note. I observe that this fact is further corroborated by

7

SI Tennakoon when he is giving evidence. In his evidence he has categorically said that the I

I

informant who provided the information is an informant of PS Upali therefore I see no reason for the

trial judge to make specific reference to the above fact in his judgment.

The Counsel further argued that, it was evident during the trial that, the police team took weighing

and sealing equipment with them but did not use them during the raid and instead weighing and

sealing was done at the Police Narcotic Bureau:

As proved before court by leading the evidence of two members of the raiding party without single

omission or contradiction, that the raid took place at a busy place, inside a bus halt at Totalanga in

spite of the protest of the Accused, it is not reasonable to expect the police party to engage in

weighing and sealing, when they can easily come back to Police Narcotic Bureau with the Accused

within a reasonable time. As admitted in court, the arrest took place around 8.45 A.M and the

productions were handed over to the productions officer after weighing and sealing at 10.40 A.M.

The Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant further doubted the hand writing appeared on the

sealed parcel and argued that the trial judge should have rejected the evidence of witness

Kumaratunga based on the said evidence since the witness failed to identify the hand writing under

cross examination. Following questions were put to the witness by the defence,

When clear evidence was led with regard to producing the production at the station, weighing and

sealing before the Accused and the investigating officer, and when the investigating officer gives an

explanation as to why a different person from the raiding party was instructed to write the envelop,

and the productions were duly handed over to the production officer within hours, this court does not

see any significance in the said argument raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellant.

The next argument raised by the Accused-Appellant cuts across his own argument with regard to

place and the way the Accused-Appellant got arrested on the day in question. The Learned Counsel

argued that it is wrong to conclude by the Learned Trial Judge that PW 1 and PW 2 had no reason to

falsely implicate the Accused-Appellant since both witness in their evidence admitted that the

Accused-Appellant had spat on them and threw sand at them when tried to arrest him and the said

facts are more than sufficient to falsely implicate him.

In contrary, the position took up by the Accused was that the said officers arrested him at his house

for no reason and the drugs were introduced to him. If this position is accepted, question of spitting

and/or throwing sand will not arise as the arrest did not take place at the bus halt as submitted by the

prosecution. Therefore I see no merit in the said argument.

~ The Learned Counsel lastly argued that the Learned Trial Judge was biased against the Accused -\

Appellant when he considered character - evidence, by referring to a previous conviction of the !

f I [ f 1

Accused -Appellant. In this regard I observe a mere reference to a previous conviction which

transpired during the cross examination of the Accused-Appellant. However when going through the

judgment carefully I observe that this reference only limits to a narration of his evidence in the

judgment but the Learned Trial Judge had not taken that into consideration when evaluating the

evidence.

In the case of Perera V. Hasheed (Sri Kantha Law Report Volume I 133) G.P.S. de Silva J (as he

then was) made the observation that it must be remembered that a judicial officer is one with a

trained legal mind and that it is a serious matter to allege bias against a Judicial Officer and that this

court would not lightly entertain such an allegation.

Even though the said observation was made under different circumstance, what is important is that,

one cannot forget the fact that the person who made the said remark in the judgment is a person with

a trained legal mind, and therefore it is wrong to argue that he was bias over the said reference unless

there is proof that he was prejudiced over the said matter. In the absence of such material before this

court, I cannot agree with the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant of this argument.

For the reasons set out above I see no reason to inter fear with the findings of the Learned High Court

Judge. I therefore up holding the judgment, conviction and the Sentence of the Learned Trial Judge

dismiss the appeal as devoid of merit.
