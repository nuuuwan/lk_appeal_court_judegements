2

The two Petitioners are companies duly incorporated in Sri Lanka having their respective registered

offices at the aforementioned address and are engaged in the business of manufacturing Garments for

export.

The Petitioners have further submitted that they are subsidiaryCompanies of "Butani Exports Ltd" and

the head office and/or principle placer of business of the said Butani Exports Ltd and the Petitioner

companies were situated at the above address.

As revealed before this court, three inquiries under the provisions of the Termination of Employment

of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 were held at the Termination Unit of the Labour

Development which was under the Deputy Commissioner of Labour - Industrial Relation, the 2nd

Respondent to the present application.

The complainants to the said three inquiries were named as the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents to the

present application. As submitted by the Petitioners, out of the three complainants the 3rd Respondent

to the present application K.P. Priyaseeli was not present at the inquiry and her application was

dismissed and the other two inquires proceeded before the 2nd Respondent.

Even though it is not relevant for this court to consider the facts of this matter, since what is

challenged before this court is the legality of the purported order made by the 1st and/or the 2nd

Respondents, we consider it important to be mindful of the factual matrix of this case before getting

into the legality of the impugned order.

As revealed before this court, the two Petitioners had their factory at No. 168/2 Kurunegala Rd,

Giriulla and collectively employed approximately 650 employees. The said factory was a garments

manufacturing factory for export upon orders which were placed by foreign buyers and the petitioners

have been carrying on business since 1989-1990.

The Petitioners' factory at Giriulla was severely damaged due to a severe flood situation the factory

faced on.3rd , 4t\ 11th and 1ih November 2006 and the deluge was followed by further flooding on

3

18th and 19th of the same month. Due to the floods some of the buildings, machinery, stocks of

garments and raw material and vehicles parked in the premises were severely damaged.

As revealed before this court, this position is confirmed by the Labour Officer attached to the Labour

Office KUliyapitiya who visited the factory after the floods on i h January 2007.

The Petitioners have taken up the position that they were obliged to continue its operations and fulfill

its contractual obligations towards its foreign buyers and as such were forced to commence its

operation in a different location until the necessary repairs were done to re-commence operations at

the same venue.

As observed by this court the dispute between the Petitioners and the 3rd to 162nd Respondents who

were the employees of the said factories began subsequent to certain initiatives taken by the petitioners

to commence the operations of the said factory at a different location.

As revealed before us the Petitioners had displayed a notice on 21.11.2006 at the factory premises. By

the said notice (page 50 of the brief) the management of the Petitioners had informed the employees

that the factory located at Giriulla would be closed indefinitely and a decision to re-open business at

the same premises or at a different location would be decided once a report was received from an

investigation team appointed by the management and until such time the management had requested

the employees to report to their head office at 199/20 Rajagiriya Rd, Rajagiriya.

The said notice was followed by another notice (page 412 and 724 of the brief) received by the

Respondents which gave rise to the inquiry conducted by the 2nd Respondent.

The Respondents have complained that the said 2nd notice gave an ultimatum to the employees to the

effect that if they failed to recommence their work at Rajagiriya factory as required to do so by the

management of the two Petitioners, steps would be taken to deem them as if they had vacated their

posts.

4

As observed by this court the Petitioners have subsequently taken steps to issue letters to the

employees who failed to commence work at Rajagiriya in accordance with their instructions and the

management informed them that "they by their own conduct had terminated their contract of

employment with the company (page 413, 414, 725, 854, 855 and 857 of the brief)

GENESIS OF THE COMPLAINT

Thesaid decision of the Petitioners to consider the employees who failed to report to Rajagiriya as

required to do so, as having constructively terminated their contract of employment with Petitioners,

gave rise to the complaints made by the 3rd to 5th Respondents alleging that the said decision of the

Petitioners was tantamount to a constructive termination of their employment.

i,I As referred to above, in the absence of the 3rd Respondent, the complaints made by the 4th and the 5th

I!

~

[

Respondents were taken up for inquiry by the 2ndRespondent.

At the commencement of the said inquires which were taken together, the employers (Petitioners to

the present case) have raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the said applications

,

before the 2nd Respondent under the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen

(Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 as amended, since the employment of the Respondents were !

I

not terminated and as such the 15t Respondent or his agent did not have the jurisdiction to entertain and

hear the complaints made under the said Act.

1I The 2nd Respondent by his order dated 06.08.2007 overruled the said preliminary objection and

decided to inquire into the complaint made by the Respondents. It is further revealed that the 2nd

Respondent had restricted the inquiry to the employees who had worked more than 180 days with the

Petitioners and also excluded the employees who had submitted their resignations.

As observed by this court, the most important issue to be dealt in the present application is whether

there is in fact a termination of the employees, since the impugned order marked as '0' was made by

the 15t and/or 2nd Respondents based on the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen

{ (Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 as amended, and the jurisdiction the said Respondents was

assumed by virtue of the provisions of said Act.

Section 2 (1) of the said Act reads thus,

2 (1) no employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workmen without

a) Prior consent in writing of the workmen or

b) The prior written approval of the Commissioner

In the absence of any prior approval obtained from the Commissioner, the Petitioners' position before

this court and their objection before the Commissioner was based on the ground that the employees

who failed to commence work at Rajagiriya as required to do so by the management had terminated

the contract of employment with the company by their own conduct and therefore the above provisions

of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act has no application to the

present case.

In support of the above contention the Petitioners have argued before this court,

a) The documents filed of record and the oral evidence led at the inquiry before the 151 and/or

2nd Respondents make it clear that there was no intercompany transfer but merely a transfer

of location.

b) There is no change of employer by the said transfer.

c) The transfers were only a location transfer in view of the necessity caused by floods.

d) As a result of the floods experienced by the factory on two occasions heavy damage and

loss were caused to the Petitioners Machinery, stocks etc.

e) Notwithstanding the heavy losses Petitioners were obliged to fulfill the contractual

obligations.

6

J I I f) The decisions to re-start the operations at the Petitioners' head office was taken in good

faith rather than closes down the business or remain idle and face litigation from customers,

employees and creditors.

As observed by this court, by placing the said argument before this court Petitioner have endeavored to

justify the action taken by them by submitting before this court,

a) That the said transfer was only a transfer from one location to another and as such no

consent of the employee is needed as they would be working within the service of the same

employer.

b) Such a transfer was necessitated since the contract of service of the Respondent with the

Petitioners were frustrated due to the supervening damage caused to the Petitioners which

rendered the performance of the contract of employment impossible

When considering the said arguments placed before this court, it is important to consider whether the

transfer referred to above was in fact a location transfer within the same company and whether such

transfers are permitted.

The Petitioners have taken up the position that the two Petitioner Companies namely P.M.K Garments

(Pvt) Ltd and Inatub Garments (Pvt) Ltd are subsidiary Companies of Butani Exports Ltd but they are

also duly incorporated companies under the Companies Act. Therefore these three companies are to be

considered as three separate legal entities. However as revealed before this court, the petitioners could

only establish that the factory which was located at Rajagiriya was a factory operated by Butani

Exports and not by P.M.K. Garments or Inatub Garments.

This position was transpired during the inquiry as follows;

From the above questions and answers given by a witness who represented the Petitioners at the

inquiry it is clear that the only factory operated at Rajagiriya was the factory belonging to Butani

Exports and the Petitioners have asked the employees at Giriulla to report to the said factory.

Even though the said witness in her evidence said that the management did not compel the employees

to report to Rajagiriya, the notice which was sent to the employees by the management of the two

Petitioners was to the effect that if the employees failed to recommence their work at Rajagiriya

factory steps would be taken to deem them as if they had vacated their posts. In our view by the said

notice management had compelled its employees to report to work at Rajagiriya even without

establishing P.M.K or Inatub factories in Rajagiriya.

On the other hand it was further revealed that none of the employees attached to P.M.K. Garments or

Inatub Garments at Giriulla were recruited by the said companies to a transferable service. This

position too was elicited at the inquiry before the Labour Commissioner as follows;

In these circumstances the following facts have been elicited before the Labour Commissioner,

.:. There was no provision in the letters of appointment issued to the employees of the two

Petitioners to transfer them from the Giriulla factory.

9

.:. Even if there was a service requirement to transfer the location, there was no factory at

Rajagiriya operated by the two Petitioners

.:. Therefore any transfer to Rajagiriya cannot be considered as an inter-company transfer.

In the case of Duch Lanka Trailers Manufacturers Ltd V. Commissioner of Labour and Others CA

Writ 511/2011 lCA minutes dated 25.06.2013]Sri Skandarajah J had considered a inter-company

transfer of an employee in the absence of specific condition in the letter of appointment permitting the

transfer, and held that the Commissioner of Labour is correct in concluding that the said transfer

amounts to constructive termination of the employee and comes within the pervious of section 6A of

the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No 45 of 1971 as amended,

In the said case the 4th Respondent who was originally employed under a fixed term contract for a

period of one year and thereafter was confirmed in his employment and continued to serve as an

employee to the said company. The Petitioner re-Iocated their factory in Dankotuwa and requested its

employees, including the 4th Respondent to report to the new factory. The 4th Respondent although

being requested by the management on several occasions in writing, refrained from reporting to work.

The Petitioners' position too was that Petitioners never terminated the services but it was the 4th

Respondent who vacated the services of employment as he had not reported to work at Dankotuwa

factory.

During the inquiry before the Commissioner, it was considered by the Commissioner that in the

absence of specific terms and conditions in his letter of appointment that he would be transferred to a

subsidiary company or to another location in the discretion of the Petitioner,

( contrary to the letters of appointment issued to the other employees) held that the said 4th Respondent

cannot be transferred from his present work place without his consent and the Petitioner by relocating

the factory to a different location deprived the Respondents of reporting to work at the original

location and therefore his services were terminated by closing down the factory.

10

In the said case the Court of Appeal when dismissing the case was mindful of the fact that in the

absence of a specific condition to transfer an employee, in his letter of appointment, the consent of the

employee is a must to effect a transfer of the employee.

The same issue was considered in slightly different circumstances in the case of Hassan V. Fairline

Garments International Ltd and others 1989 (2) Sri LR 137 where the Supreme Court held that a

workman has an inalienable right to choose for himself the employer he will serve. Once the

contractual relationship between himself and his employer is established, the employer cannot transfer

his services to another without his (the employee's) consent or against his will.

During the argument before us the Petitioners have submitted that as a past practice of their group of

companies, transferring the working location of staff for other reasons had taken place and at one stage

the employees of Butani Export were transferred to Giriulla from Rajagiriya. A practice which was

never challenged cannot be considered legally acceptable practice if it was done contrary to the service

agreement between the employer and employee and therefore the said argument cannot be considered

as a ground for the Petitioners to succeed in the present application.

A contract of employment delineates and defines the relationships between the employer and

employee. Given that the employees in this case fall within the express provisions of the Termination

of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 as amended, Section 2(1) of the

Act is quite specific that prior consent in writing of the workman or the written approval of the

Commissioner must be obtained before an employer proceeds to terminate the scheduled employment

of any workman. The ultimatum given to the employees in the instant case that they would be deemed

to have vacated their employment, unmistakably furnishers proof of constructive termination of the

employment. No prior approval of the employees has been obtained to affect such an eventuality.

In the application before us, there is no clause in the contract of employment that the employees would

be relocated to a factory as distantly located as Rajagiriya in the event of a supervening impossibility.

If an onerous condition such as a transfer from Giriulla to Rajagiriya is to be imposed by the employer,

I 1 I

1 1 I

the employee has to be put on notice of such a possibility and he should express his consent, express

or implied to such a term.

Such a term in the contract of employment would serve notice of a possibility of a relocation and if the

employee had accepted his contract subject to the terms, it may not now lie in the mouth of the

employee to contend that he had not consented to such a transfer. Such a notification is woefully

lacking in the instant application before us. Instead what we have before us is a caveat that if the

employee did not report to Rajagiriya he would be deemed to have vacated his post.

This is not the norm that is mandated by the provisions of the Termination of Employment of

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 as amended. Instead of securing the prior consent of

the workmen, one cannot, quite contrary to the legislative intent, impose a term that the employee

would be deemed to have vacated the employment. We hold that there is an infringement of Section

2(1) of the Act when the employees were directed to report to work willy-nilly at Rajagiriya. Taking

the view as we do of the requirement that employers have to incorporate in the contract of

employment a notification of a possible change of location in the event of supervening circumstances

and other causes, employers would reflect well bear in their contemplation such circumstances as

would necessitate such a relocation in the event of natural calamities and vis major and therefore in

the circumstances we hold that a plea of frustration of the contract of employment as was contended

in the case would not hold water.

In Magpeck Exports Ltd., v. Commissioner of Labour(2002)2 Sri LR p.308 the doctrine of frustration

of contract was unsuccessfully pleaded where an employer company argued that it had to terminate its

employees without compensation because the business was a failure. In that case, the petitioner

company had closed the establishment without informing the workers on time or without obtaining

prior written approval of the Commissioner of Labour. The Commissioner of Labour on being

informed caused an inquiry to be held and he made order directing the company to pay each workman

two months' salary for each year of service.

J12\ )If

\

In appeal, it was argued that due to financial constraints the company was compelled to close down. It

was further argued that there was termination by frustration or due to impossibility of performance. In

rejecting the argument, the Court of Appeal held that the doctrine of frustration had no application.

So we hold that no error of law or fact is manifest on the order marked as "0" as we hold that it

emanates from the findings and recommendation of the 2nd Respondent (R4) which are not tainted by

any of the grounds on which judicial review lies and in the circumstances we are disinclined to allow

the reliefs prayed for in the application for judicial review.

Thus we proceed to dismiss the application for prerogative writs.
