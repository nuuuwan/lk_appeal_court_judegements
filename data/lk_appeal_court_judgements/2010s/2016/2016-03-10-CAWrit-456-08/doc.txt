: 20th January, 2016

: oath March, 2016

The petitioner has filed this application against the respondents

praying for a writ of Certiorari to quash a decision taken by the Municipal

Council of Anuradhapura to increase the charges for advertising

hoardings from January 200a indicated in X23 and X25.

The petitioner's counsel submitted that the first respondent had

decided to increase it's charges from Rs. 50/= per square foot to Rs.

200/= which is 400%, which the petitioner stated is arbitrary,

unreasonable unjust and ultra vires.

The learned counsel submitted that the Municipal Council is

entitled to pass by-laws in terms of Section 272 (6) (d) of the Municipal

Council Ordinance, and such by-laws become valid only in terms of Sec.

268. Under Section 268 the by-laws have to be approved by the Minister

and confirmed by Parliament and notification of such confirmation has to

be published in the Gazette. The petitioner stated that the said by-law

published in the said Gazette No. 1572 dated 17/10/2008 does not

lawfully entitle the first respondent to charge or increase the fees for the

hoardings since the said Gazette has been published long after the

letters marked X23 and X25 had been sent. He further stated that the

said Gazette notification is not a publication in terms of Sec. 268 of the

said ordinance, since it does not fulfill the requirements of Sec. 268 (1)

and (2).

j

Citing the judgment in Chandrasiri vs University of Ruhuna II

2006 1 SLR 156 the petitioner submitted that a Municipal Council is not

entitle in law to act arbitrarily or unreasonably or in an unjust matter in

the exercise of the powers or discretion vested in them.

The petitioner mentioning the judgments in Kathiresan vs

Sirimevan Bibile 1992 1 SLR 275 and Wickremasinghe and another

3

II

vs The Urban Development Authority 2003 3 SLR 253 stated that

[ I it l i

where the discretion is vested in an authority it should be exercised

reasonably and that the elements of reasonableness is discussed in by

Lord Green which is referred to as "Wednesbury's unreasonableness" in

the Wednesbury case.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that under

Sec. 267 of the Municipal Council Ordinance every Municipal Council

may make by laws following the stipulated procedure which is laid down

in the Local Authorities (standard by-laws) Act NO.6 of 1952 and under

Sec. 2 of the said Act the Minister of Local Government made standard

by-laws and published in the government Gazette. He further stated that

under this Act each Municipal Council need not go to Parliament or get

approval from the Minister individually to make by-laws, and that the

standard by-laws could be adopted by each Municipal Council as their

own by-laws following the procedure laid down in the Act. The

respondents further submitted that under the said Act No. 6 of 1952 the

Minister has made the by-laws and published them in the Gazette No.

54117 dated 20.01.1989 marked A1 thereafter each Municipal Council

had to adopt the said by-laws by passing a resolution in their council

meeting and publish that in the government Gazette and thereby

adopted those by-laws as their own. He cited the judgment in SC (FIR)

Application 252/2007 which referred to adopting of by-laws by Municipal

Council.

! The counsel for the respondents submitted that the petitioners

has not looked into this aspect of the law and only confined himself to a

few sections of the Municipal Council Ordinance disregarding the

correct procedure and law relating to the adoption of by-laws and has

confused himself.

The respondents further stated that the reasonability or fairness is

a relative concept and has to be looked at in accordance with the given

situation and it depends on the circumstances of each case. The

respondents stated that in 1980 the charges were increased to Rs. 15/=

per square foot and to Rs. 50/= per square foot in 1995 after 15 years

which was three times at that time. Now after thirteen years in 2008 they

have increased from Rs. 50/= to Rs. 200/= in view of the cost of living

and other expenses with regard to maintaining of the sacred city. The

respondents stated that the Municipal Council of Nuwara Eliya charged

Rs. 250/= to Rs. 500/= per square foot and Thamankaduwa Pradeshiya

Sabha Rs. 250/= per square foot and that they have followed the same

procedure to increase the fees.

The respondents citing the judgment in Nirmala De Silva vs

Seneviratne and others 1982 (2) SLR 569 stated that under the

circumstances of this case gazetting the decision to increase the

5

\

charges in the year 2008 was quite correct and within the settled law

and that a few months delay in gazetting does not matter.

This court has to decide whether the respondents had the

authority to take a decision to increase the advertising charges and if so

was it reasonable and whether the decision is legal.

In the case of SC (FIR) Application 252/2007 it was stated.

"As stated earlier it was not disputed that a displaying of

advertisements within the Colombo Municipality area was

regulated by the by-laws which came into operation in 1949 and

the by-laws Gazetted in the government Gazette notification

bearing No. 541/17 dated 20/01/1989 and adopted by the

Colombo Municipal council".

The Anuradhapura Municipal Council has duly adopted the by-

laws Gazetted in No. 541/17 of 20101/1989 at their council meeting held

on 15/10/2006 and published in the Gazette No. 1477 dated 22/12/2006

bY which the whole legal process was completed and the by-laws in

6

I i

{

541/17 become the by-laws of Anuradhapura Municipal Council

therefore the Anuradhapura Municipal Council could legally increase the

charges for advertisements in its areas as per the Gazette marked A.

The petitioner has failed to look into this aspect of the law and only

confined himself to a few sections of the Municipal Council Ordinance

and disregarded the procedure and the law relating to the adoption of

the by-laws.

On the argument of reasonability of the increased charges,

compared to the other Municipal Council areas as stated by the

respondents one cannot say Rs. 2001= is unreasonable. Anuradhapura

Municipal Council has to maintain the sacred city by maintaining the

roads, sanitary facilities and drainage system and also provide services

to the pilgrims as well as the tourists. The petitioner under these

circumstances can not say the increase was unreasonable.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to refuse the application of

the petitioner with costs fixed at Rs. 100,0001=.
