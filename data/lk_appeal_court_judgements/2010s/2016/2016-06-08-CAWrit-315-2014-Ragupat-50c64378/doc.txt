Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application Ragupathi Upulwan Serasinhe had come before this court seeking

inter alia,

d) A Writ in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to

conduct elections of the Executive Council of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports on 2ih

August 2014.

e) A Writ in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing the 5th to 30th Respondents from

holding office and/or performing functions as the Executive Council of the Sri Lanka

Automobile Sports

f) A Writ in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 4th Respondent to direct the

20t\ 31s" 32nd, 33rd, and 34th Respondent members of the interim committee of the Sri

Lanka Automobile Sports to resume duties as per the letter of appointment dated i h

May 2013 appointing them to the said interim committee until the conduct of a proper

election at the Annual General Meeting.

g) A Writ in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 20th, 31s,,32nd 33rd and 34th

Respondent members of the interim committee of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports to

convene an Annual General Meeting for the purpose of lawfully conducting an election [

of the Executive Council of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports

When this application was supported for notices and interim relief as prayed in paragraphs (b) and (c)

the court after considering the submissions made by all the parties, decided not to grant interim relief

but decided to take up this matter without delay giving a time frame to the parties to file objections

before this court.

As agreed before court, parties stick to the time frame given by court but the arguments took a long

time than expected since the parties heavily contested the issues raised before us.

However as observed by this court there was a clear division among the parties represented before this

court and some of the Respondent supported the position taken up by the Petitioner, where as the other

Respondents justified the impugned decision and the subsequent events took place based on the said

decision.

Petitioner who has served as the treasure of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (previously known as

Sri Lanka Association of Motor Sports) from 2006 to 2013 and currently a committee member of the

Sri Lank Auto-sports Drivers Association, has complained before this court of a decision by the 1st

Respondent to conduct the elections in respect of the Executive Council of the Sri Lanka Automobile

Sports which according to the Petitioner, was made acting in excess of the power vested in him and

disregarding the matters the 1st Respondent should have considered before taking such decision.

As admitted by all the parties before this court, an Annual General Meeting of Sri Lanka Automobile

Sports was held on 31st March 2013 at which office bearers were elected in its ordinary course of

business. However subsequent to the said Annual General Meeting several complaints were made to

the 4th Respondent Minister, alleging ineligibly of members elected through the said Annual General

Meeting. The 4th Respondent under the power vested in him under section 32 and 34 (1) of the Sports

Law No 25 of 1973 as amended, dissolved the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports and appointed an interim

committee comprising of the 20th, 31St, 32nd, 33rd and 34th Respondents on or about i h May 2013

acting under section 33 of the said Sports Law.

The main complaint before this court by the Petitioner was a subsequent decision by the lSI

Respondent to conduct an election to select the Executive Council without following the proper

procedures and acting in excess of the powers vested on him.

In support of the said position the Petitioner had submitted before this court,

a) The lSI Respondent exceeded her powers in calling for an election

b) The lSI Respondent and/or other relevant Respondents failed to consider that the decision as

to the arrangements of the election were required to have been made by the interim

committee

c) The lSI Respondent and/or certain other Respondents have exceeded their powers III

approving nominations of clubs which are not eligible to vote

d) The lSI Respondent and/or other relevant Respondents have exceeded their powers III

considering the votes of clubs which are not eligible to vote

e) The lSI Respondent and/or other relevant Respondents have exceeded their powers III

approving 3 nominations to the Executive Council from a member club

f) The lSI Respondent and/or other relevant Respondents failed to consider the nominees that

ought to have been disqualified from being elected as per regulation 15 of Gazette Extra

Ordinary 1793/3 dated 151h January 2013

g) The lSI Respondent and/or other relevant Respondents disregarded the requirement for

members of the interim committee to stand barred from contesting for any post in the

Association

Out of the several issues raised before this court as referred to above, the main issue this court will

have to consider in this application is whether the lSI Respondent and/or any other Respondents acted

in excess of their powers vested on them under the said Sports Law and the Regulation made there

under, when deciding to conduct the elections for the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports as evinced in

document produced marked P-5. The other issues raised before this court by the Petitioner are issues

10

arisen subsequently as a result of the said decision of the 1st Respondent to conduct the elections for

Sri Lanka Automobile Sports and therefore the said issues will only refers to the subsequent conduct

of the 1st and or other relevant Respondents.

However as against the said position taken up by the Petitioner and some of the Respondents who

supported the Petitioner, the 1st to 4th Respondents and the counsel representing the 5th_13t\ 18th_20t\

23rd _30th and 35th Respondents mainly argued that the said decision of the 1st Respondent as evinced

in P-5 and the subsequent conduct/decisions of the 1st and/or other relevant Respondents are not illegal

and taken within the powers vested on them.

The said Respondents further argued before us that the Petitioner is not entitled to any relief from this

court due to his conduct where he has acquiescence in the conduct of the 1st to 4th Respondents without

challenging the decision, taking part in the said elections.

This court will now proceed to consider the legality of the decision which is evinced from the

document produced marked P-5.

As admitted by all the parties, at the time P-5 was sent by the 1st Respondent an interim committee

consist of 20t\ 31st _34th Respondents appointed by the 4th Respondent was continuing with the

functions of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports.

Section 33 of the Sports Law 25 of 1973 which reads thus,

"The Minister may make interim arrangements for continuing the functions of a National

Association of Sports under suspension or whose registration has been refused or cancelled."

Regulation 55 of the Sports Regulation published in Government Gazette 1793/3 dated 15.01.2013

made under Section 41 of the said Sports Law deals with the powers of the interim committee as

follows;

I

(

1 1

55 (1) -Upon interim arrangements being made by the Minister in terms of section 33 of the Law, any

person or persons entrusted with the task of continuing the functions of a National Association

of Sports, which Association is under suspension or whose registration has been refused or

cancelled shall manage all movable or immovable property which is owned by or in the lawful

possession of such National Association, as trustees of such National Association and shall

take steps to manage and control such movable and immovable property to the office bearers of

the National Association of Sports. In this respect taking over and handing over of such

movable or immovable property which is owned by, or in the lawful possession of, such

National Association should properly documented and recorded while a copy of the same

should be submitted to the Director- General.

(2) - It shall be duty of the persons entrusted with continuing of such National Association to

conduct their functions diligently and to manage and control the property entrusted to them

diligently.

(3) - The person or persons appointed under any interim arrangements in terms of section 33 of the ~

Law for continuing the functions of a National Association of Sports under suspension or \whose registration has been refused or canceled, shall enjoy all powers, rights and privileges r

as those enjoyed by the National Association of Sports, whose registration has been

suspended, canceled or refused including inter alia the rights to enter into any contracts,

agreements, operate bank accounts and the said person or persons shall be fully empowered to

continue all the affairs of the National Association of Sports whose registration has been

suspended, canceled or refused and shall enter into new arrangements or projects as the said

person or persons may deem fit for continuing the functions of the National Association of

Sports whose registration has been suspended, canceled or refused.(emphasis added).

As observed by this court, under the provisions of the Regulation 55 (3) of the said regulation the

interim committee so appointed shall be fully empowered to continue all the affairs of the National

1

J 1

I 1

12

Association and therefore this court has no reason to reject the argument raised by the Petitioner as

well as the 31 st,32nd and 33rd Respondents that the interim committee is empowered to hold an Annual

General Meeting in order to elect the office bearers to the executive committee of the National

Association.

At the same time this court cannot undermine the powers vested on the Minister under the said Sports

Law and the Regulations made there under.

As observed by this court the Minister has amended the Regulation made under section 41 of the

Sports Law No 25 of 1973 by the insertion immediately after the regulation 54 (2) of the following

new regulation which reads as 54 (3) of the said regulation.

54 (3) "Notwithstanding anything in any of the proceeding regulations the Minister may direct the

secretary, Additional Secretary or Director General of Sport of the Ministry of Sports to

convene and conduct for such purpose and in such manner as may be determined by the

Minister, Special General Meeting, General Meeting or Committee Meeting of any National

Association. Any such meeting so convened and conducted shall be deemed to be duly

constituted meeting of the National Association."

The said Regulation 54 (3) has clearly empowered the Minister (may) to direct the Secretary,

Additional Secretary or Director General Sports to convene and conduct, Special General Meeting,

General Meeting or Committee Meeting as may be determined by the Minister.

Therefore it is very much clear from the regulations referred to above, that either the interim

committee appointed by the Minister under section 33 of the Sports Law or Secretary, Additional

Secretary or the Director General Sports as directed by the Minister under Regulation 54 (3) is

empowered to conduct a meeting to elect new office bearers.

As observed by this Court the Hon. Minister has exercised the powers vested on him under section 54

(3) of the Regulations of National Sports Association in respect of the,

4. Cycling federation of Sri Lanka

and authorized the 1st Respondent to convene and conduct meetings in order to elect new office

bearers.

However as submitted by the counsel for the Petitioner, document marked P-5 which is the decision of

the 1st Respondent to conduct the meeting to elect the new office bearers on 13.08.2014 had reference

to the Government Gazette 1831/2 dated 07.10.2013 under which the 1st Respondent is said to be

empowered to conduct the said election. As observed by this court earlier, the said Gazette has only

empower the 1st Respondent to conduct elections for the Four Associations I have referred to above

and therefore, if the 1st Respondent claims that she acted on the powers vested on her by the said

Gazette, it is understood that she had exceeded her power by doing so, since she was only empowered

by the said Gazette to convene and conduct elections in respect of the four associations referred to

above.

However when the statement of objection of the 1st Respondent was tendered before this court, the 1st

Respondent had attached a letter dated 25.06.2014 written by the 4th Respondent Minister directing the

1 st Respondent to conduct the elections of office bearers for Sri Lanka Automobile Sports.

The Learned State Counsel who represented 1st to 4th Respondents while submitting the said letter

marked 1R4 submitted that even though the Minister (4th Respondent) had decided to call for an

election of office bearers for Sri Lanka Automobile Sports, on account of some administrative laps this

decision was not conveyed to the 1st Respondent in writing until 25.06.2014.

However this court is mindful of the fact that the same minister had issued a Gazette Notifications

when he decided to exercise the powers vested on him under Regulation 54 (3) with regard to

I 1 I I I I j ; )

1 I I !

14

Four Associations in October 2013 but decided to direct the same Director General by sending a letter

several days after the said Director General communicating with the parties concerned.

In this regard the Learned Senior Counsel for the Sth _13th , 18th_20th, 23rd_30th and 3Sth Respondents

argued that the direction made by the Minister to the Director General of Sports does not need to be

Gazetted nor is there any provision expressly requiring that such direction be in writing.

The argument by the said Respondents before this court was that the 4th Respondent by sending 1R4

had clearly ratified the act of the 1st Respondent.

In support of this position the Respondent relied on the observations of Wood Renton CJ III

Sinnathamby V. Johnpulle 18 NLR 273 to the effect;

"There is no doubt that a principal can ratify the unauthorized act of an agent only when he is

fully aware of its nature. Such knowledge may be proved either by direct evidence of its

existence or by showing that it is a necessary inference in the circumstances of a case taken as

a whole."

However when considering the existence of the document produced marked 1R4 this court would

prefer to analyze the circumstances under which the 1st Respondent had acted upon when conducting

the elections.

As observed by this court when the 1st Respondent wrote P-S, he did not refer to any specific directive

he received from the Minister but referred to the Gazette Notification No. 1831/2 dated 07.10.2013

under which he was empowered by the Minister to hold the elections.

As identified by this court the said Gazette Notification has empowered the 1st Respondent to hold

elections in 4 other associations but not Sri Lanka Automobile Sports.

The subsequent conduct of the 4th Respondent becomes more suspicious when he decided to send a

letter directing the 1st Respondent to dissolve the interim committee and to hold an election.

If the 1st Respondent had genuinely acted upon the said directive he received from the Minister the 1 st

step he should have taken was to dissolve the interim committee but, instead, the 1st Respondent

continue to have discussions with the members of the interim committee with regard to issues

pertaining to the conducting of elections. This is evident from the document produced marked A-4 by

the 31st _33rd Respondents along with their statement of objection. During the arguments before this

court it was revealed that the interim committee was functioning until the date on which the elections

were held, i.e. 27.08.2014.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the Counsel for the 31st -33 rd Respondents had challenged the

genuineness of the document lR4 and argued that it was an introduction and not a genuine document.

When considering the circumstances under which the 1st Respondent had acted when conducting the

said election, this court has no reason to reject the said argument, since the conduct of the 1st

Respondent does not support that he was acting on the directives received by the 4th Respondent

through lR4.

However the Learned State Counsel explained the delay in sending IR4 as only an "administrative

laps" and submitted that "the Petitioner should not be fussed about the timing of the Minister's letter to

the Director General since the Director General must act pursuant to the directions of the Minister."

This court has no reason to reject the said argument raised by the Learned Counsel but what is

important to consider at this stage is that, at the time P-5 was issued by the 1st Respondent, whether

there was in fact a directive made by the 4th Respondent under section 54 (3) of the regulations or not.

This court cannot agree with the Learned State Counsel and the counsel for the 5th _13t\ 18th_20t\ 23rd _

30th and 35th Respondents that the so called ratification had endorsed the acts committed by the 1st

Respondent. Therefore it is correct to say that the 1st Respondent when issued the document produced

marked P-5, had acted in excess of his power.

I

1

I

16

Wade and Forsyth had observed the act committed by Public Authorities in excess of their powers as

follows,

"Judicial review is thus a fundamental mechanism for keeping public authorities within due

bounds and for upholding the rule of law. Instead of substituting its own decision for that of

some other body, as happens when on appeal, the court on review is concerned only with the

question whether the act or order under attack should be allowed to stand or not. If the Home

Secretary revokes a television license unlawfully, the court may simply declare that the

revocation is null and void." Should the case be one involving breach of duty rather than

excess of power, the question will be whether the pubic authority should be ordered to make

good a default. Refusal to issue a television license to someone entitled to have one would be

remedied by an order of the court requiring the issue of the license. If administrative action is

an excess of power (ultra vires), the court has only to quash it or declare it unlawful (these are

in effect the same thing) and then no one need pay any attention to it. The minister or tribunal

or other authority has in law nothing, and must make a fresh decision."

In the case of Sirisena and Others Vs, H.S.R.B. Kobbekaduwa Minister of Agriculture and Lands 80

NLR 1 Perera J held,

"If the repository of a power exceeds its authority or if a power is exercised without authority,

such purported exercise of power may be pronounced invalid"

During the arguments before this court, the Learned State Counsel and the Senior Counsel for 5th _13 t\

18th _20th, 23rd _30th and 35th Respondents argued that the Petitioner is not entitling for any relief from

this court due to his own conduct, to wit. he has acquiesced in the conduct of the 1st Respondent

without challenging the legality of the same.

f , I I t

17

Whilst referring to the decision of Sharawananda J (as he was then) in Nagalingam V. De Mel 78 NLR

231 the Learned Counsel argued that Acquiescence with the conduct of a public officer precludes a

challenge of that action.

However when considering the facts of the case in hand we see no relevance to the said decision since

the material available in the present case clearly establishes that the 1st Respondent had acted in excess

of his powers when he decided to conduct the election at Sri Lanka Automobile Sports as evinced in

document marked P-5. Therefore we are of the view that the conduct of the Petitioner by taking part in

the election without challenging the same will not preclude him from challenging the decision of the 1st

Respondent to hold the election on the ground of the acquiescence since the decision to hold the

election by the 1st Respondent itself is taken in excess of the powers of the 1st Respondent as already

observed by this court. Under these circumstances this court cannot agree with the said argument raised

by the Respondents.

For the afore said reasons this court concludes that the purported decision by the 1st Respondent to

conduct elections of the Executive Council of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports is made ultra vires and

therefore we decide to quash the said decision as evinced in P-5 by issuing a mandate in the nature of

Writ of Certiorari as prayed in paragraph (d) of the prayer to the Petition.

Since the decision to hold the election was made ultra vires and the Executive Council so elected on

27.08.2014 was elected during an election held on a decision already concluded as a decision declared

ultra vires, this court further decides to issues a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition as prayed

in paragraph (e) of the prayer to the Petition preventing the 5th to 30th Respondents from holding office

as office bearers of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports as elected from the Elections held on 27.08.2014.

As observed by this court the Minister is empowered under section 33 of the Sports Law No. 25 of

1973 and the regulation made there under to appoint an interim committee to continue with the

functions of a National Association and also empowered under regulation 54 (3) of the regulation made

, i I

\ I I

,~ j i

18

under Section 41 of the said Sports Law to direct the Secretary, Additional Secretary or the Director

General Sports to convene and conduct Special General Meeting, General Meeting or Committee

Meeting of the National Association this court is not inclined to issue mandates in the nature of Writ of

Mandamus as prayed in paragraphs (t) and (g) of the prayer to the Petition.

Writ of Certiorari and Prohibition as prayed in paragraphs (d) and (e) are granted.

Application is partly allowed.
