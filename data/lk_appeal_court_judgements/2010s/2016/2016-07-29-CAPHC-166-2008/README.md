The petitioner-appellant has preferred this appeal to set aside the order dated 11112/2008

ofthe Learned High Court Judge of the High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy

(exercising Civil Appellate Court Jurisdiction) and further the relief as prayed for Notices

to all parties and there registered Attorney-at Law has been issued on 18-01-2016.

Petitioner has been absent and unrepresented. Counsel for the respondent has appeared in

court and argument has been concluded. Court has ordered to the respondent-respondent

to file written submissions and he has filed same. We have considered the petition and

affidavit and the evidence and both oral and written submissions of the respondent-

respondent. The Learned High Court Judge by his Order dated 11-2-2008 has held inter

alia that the appellant is not entitled to seek writs of certiorari and mandamus as prayed in

the petition for reasons of non-compliance of rule 3.1 ( a) of the Court of Appeal in that the

appellants had failed to annex to their petition originals or certified copies of documents

on which they relied upon to establish the discretionary remedy.

On a perusal of the original record I find that Photostat copies of documents that marked,

oll ol2 ol3 ol4 ol5 ol6 ol7 ol8 ol9 OlIO ol11 ol12 ol13 ol14 ol15

ol16 ol17 ol18 ol19 Ol2 a 0121 has been tendered to court and documents marked,

0(3)1 0(3)2 0(3)3 0(3)4 0(3)5 0(3)6 0(3)7 0(3)8 0(3)9 0(3)10 0(3)11 0(3)12 0(3)13

0(3)14 0(3)15 duly certified by the Secretary of Abagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha has been

produced the court. The documents tendered to court by the appellant contains a seal as

true copy of the original and a sign placed thereof but, however it does not contain as to

who certified the documents.

According to the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure Rules) rule 3.1 (a) which read as

follows,

"Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers vested in

the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by way of petition,

together with an affidavit in support ofthe averments therein, and shall be accompanied by

the originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies thereof) in

the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he shall

state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the Court to furnish such document

later. Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex

mero motu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such application."

We find that the appellant has not forward to court the original or duly certified copies of

the documents tendered to court by him. Accordingly I hold that the appellant has not

complied with rule 3.1(a).

The case ofCA (PHC) 164/2008 HCCA Kandy Writ 37/2006 decided on 29-04-2004,

A.W.A Salam, J has stated,

"The petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) sought the writ of

certiorari to quash the notice marked as P28 and a writ of mandamus to enforce the decision

contained in document marked P 24. The Learned High Court Judge by judgment dated

11-12-2008 held inter alia that the petitioner is not entitled to seek writs of certiorari and

mandamus as prayed for in the petition for reason of his non-compliance of rule 3.1(a) of

Court of Appeal in that the petitioner had failed to annex to his petition originals or certified

copies of documents on which he relied upon to establish his case against the respondents

to obtain the discretionary remedy.

4

Since the petitioner has failed to comply with the rules regarding the production of the

documents on which he relied upon to prove his case, the petitioner is not entitled to

succeed in his appeal."

Accordingly as the appellant has not tendered to court the original or certified copies of

said documents oll ol2 ol3 ol4 ol5 ol6 ol7 ol8 ol9 OlIO olll oll2 oll3

oll4 oll5 oll6 oll7 oll8 oll9 ol20 ol21. We hold that the Learned High Court

Judge has come to a correct decision when he decided that section 3.1(a) of the rules has

not been complied with by the appellant and that the case should be dismissed in limine "6 q~C) ~@ qac50)@o@ .B3~gm) t'J:l@ gOJ(.j"

Accordingly we accept the submissions made by the Learned Counsel for the respondent-

respondent and dismiss this appeal with cost. The Registrar is directed to return the original

case record together with a copy ofthe order to the Learned High Court Judge of the Central

Province (exercising Civil Appellate Jurisdiction) ofKandy.
