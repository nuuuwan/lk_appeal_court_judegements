ORDER PERTAINING TO THE OBJECTION FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE

OPERATION OF THE INTERIM RELIEF

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioners in this case having filed this petition in the registry of this

court on 2016-03-21, supported it before this bench on 2016-03-28 without

notice to the Respondents. This court, having heard, only the submissions

of the learned counsel for the Petitioners, ordered

I. that notices be issued on the Respondents,

II. that the interim reliefs prayed for as per paragraph h(i), (iii) & (iv) of

the prayers to the petition be granted for a limited period of 11 days,

i.e. until 2016-04-08.

On the notice returnable date i.e. on 2016-04-08 learned counsel for the

Respondents having appeared in court objected to the extension of the

interim order issued ex parte by this court at the first instance.

Thereafter this court afforded the opportunities for all the parties to file

objections and counter objections with regard to the limited scope of the

inquiry, to be held to decide whether this court should extend the

operation of the interim order, and then fixed the inquiry for 2016-05-17

and thereafter, further inquiry for 2016-05-24.

We heard the extensive submissions at length by learned counsel for all

the parties on those two days. They thereafter, filed written submissions

also and then concluded the said inquiry.

Learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioners insisted that this court

should extend the operation of the interim order until the final

determination of this application while the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the learned

President's Counsel appearing for the 5th Respondent, vigorously argued

that this court should not have granted the said interim reliefs in the first

place.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the 1st - 3rd and the 5th

Respondents that this Court would never have made this interim order, if it

had the benefit of hearing the opposing parties and that this court should

vacate the said interim order forthwith.

As it stands at present, the task before this court is to decide whether this

court should extend the interim orders it made ex parte until the final

determination of this application or vacate the same forthwith.

Having the above task in mind it would be in order to first re-visit the

grounds which a court should consider when it is tasked to resolve this

type of problem.

It should be noted at the inception that the discretion to decide the

granting of interim reliefs have been left to courts. However our courts

\

J

f f , , f , I

J I

It It ! ! i

I !! ! t

f

~ [ I, r

6

have at some occasions laid down broader guide lines to regulate the

exercise of this discretion by courts.

One such judgment is Duwearachchi Vs Vincent Pereral . In that case this

court has laid down three principles which courts should consider when

they are called upon to decide the issuance or non-issuance of a stay

order.

These principles are as follows:

(a) Will a final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is

successful?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

(c) Will irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to

either party ?

Learned counsel for all the parties have in principle agreed that the above

judgment reflects the present legal position. I

l However the learned counsel for the Petitioner has advanced an argument

that the ground namely, that there is a 'prima facie sustainable case' made

out by the Petitioner for the issuance of a writ of Certiorari could also be

considered as a basis for granting interim reliefs.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in his written submission has quoted an

extract from a judgment of this court in NatWealth Securities Ltd Vs The

Monetary Board of the Central Bank, and five others2 to advance the above

argument. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners

11984 (2) SLR 94

2 CA (Writ) Application No. 335/ 2015 CA Minutes of 2016-03-29

I

I i I t

that the quoted extract of that judgment gives the impression that such an

argument is possible, as this court in that judgment had considered the

facts of that case also in the course of the inquiry relating to extension of

the interim reliefs in that case.

It is convenient to reproduce the relevant paragraph in that judgment to

show as to why it became necessary for this court to touch on major facts

in that case. It is as follows.

II Although this court has to limit the scope of this order only to the

question whether or not the interim order should be extended or not, it has

become necessary for this court to touch on at least some of the major

facts pertaining to this case as learned counsel for all the parties had not

only extensively addressed this court but also heavily relied upon those

grounds in this inquiry. Further, consideration of the above facts has

become necessary particularly to find an answer to the question as to

where the balance of convenience lies and also to ascertain whether there

would be any irreparable loss and damage caused to any party in this

case. 113

The above paragraph is clear in its purpose and the consideration of major

issues of facts was done for a particular purpose mentioned therein. That

move was directed to find answers to the questions that this court had to

answer when it applied the tests set out in the judgment of Duwearachchi's

case4 Thus, while it is right to say that this court did touch on some of the

major facts in that case, it is not right to say that this court considered

3 (Ibid) at pages 6 & 7 of that judgment.

4 Supra I I

whether or not there is a 'prima facie sustainable case' as a ground for the

granting of interim relief.

If the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners that court should

extend the operation of the interim relief it had granted, on the basis that

the petitioners have made out a 'Prima facie sustainable case', is to be

accepted, this court will have to issue interim reliefs every time it decides

to issue notices on the respondents. This is because court decides to issue

notices on the respondents si nce it is satisfied that there is a pri ma facie

case to be looked into.

Be that as it may, as has been done in the case 'of NatWealth Securities Ltd

Vs The Monetary Board of the Central Banks, this court will albeit proceed

to consider briefly some of the contested issues of facts in this case also to

find out whether a final judgment in this case would render nugatory if the

petitioner becomes successful or whether there would be any irreparable

loss and or damage caused to any party in this case and also to find out as

to where the balance of convenience lies.

The Petitioners' primary complaint in this application is the registration of a

medicine by the 1st Respondent in violation of the law (substantive ultra

vires), in violation of the procedure (procedural ultra vires), and contrary to

established practice and the declared policies which have been consistently

followed (unreasonableness and ultra vires).6

The legal position asserted by the Petitioners can be summarized as

follows:-

I1 i !

a. All registrations of medicines should be done in compliance with the

NMRA Act.

b. However, the NMRA Act is silent on the procedure to be followed on

biological medicines. Although regulations are permitted to be made

in this connection, no regulations have been framed. Thus, in terms

of the existing legal frame work, no bio similar can be registered in

Sri Lanka.

c. The respondents have issued the circular P 12 to examine a bio-

similar candidate, to first establish that it is in fact a bio similar.

There is no other regulation, circular or guidelines presently available.

If it is established that it is in fact a bro similar, then it must be

submitted for evaluation under the normal procedure set out in the

NMRA Act.

d. Following the WHO guidelines on evaluation of bio similars marked P

11, and insisting on the approval from a WHO reference country is

the declared and consistently followed policy of the 1st -3rd

Respondents in respect of a bio-similar.

e. Where an oncology medicine is concerned, the medicine should be

evaluated by an oncologist, nominated by the College of Oncologists

who is invited to the deliberations of the Medicines Evaluation

Committee of the 1st Respondent.

In summary it is the position of the Petitioners, that any bio similar

candidate of an oncology medicine should first establish that it is a bio-

Similar, by reference to the circular P 12, obtain approval from a WHO

!

reference country, and then undergo the evaluation under the NMRA Act,

at which stage, an evaluation must be conducted by an Oncologist.

It is the position of the Petitioners that the establishing the proposed drug

to be a bio similar, is an additional step in the process of drug evaluation;

and not an alternative to drug evaluation.

The Petitioners' complaint is that none of the above processes was

followed in the case of the medicine of the 5th Respondent, "Herticad".

On the contrary it is the argument of learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the learned

President's Counsel appearing for the 5th Respondent that

i. the purpose of Medicine Policy of Sri Lanka and the NMRA Act is to

encourage true and meaningful competition so as "to ensure the

availability of efficacious, safe and good quality medicines to the

public at affordable prices.

ii. the Petitioners have filed this application to preserve, what they

consider to be their exclusive right to the drug "trastuzumab", and

this is based on the premise and claim that the 5th Respondent's drug

is not a bio similar of "trastuzumab". In doing this, they have

collaterally challenged the registration process.

iii. what the Petitioners are seeking to do is to put in issue a question of

fact, which can be effectively resolved only through a process that

permits the calling of oral and documentary evidence, and

clarifications and determinations based on real, expert evidence.

iv. Thus, although the Petitioners claim that the 5th Respondent's drug

is not a bio similar, this is not a matter in respect of which the 1st to

3rd Respondents are entitled to presume that the information

contained in the documentation (dossier) submitted by the 5th

Respondent for evaluation and consideration for the purposes of

registration, is false.

It would be appropriate at this juncture to proceed to consider whether the

Petitioners have satisfied this Court with any of the grounds for the

issuance of interim reliefs.

Will a final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is successful?

The Petitioners' drug is 'trastuzumab' and the 5th Respondent's drug is

'Hertcad'. Both these drugs are being sold in Sri Lanka until the issuance of

this stay order. As a result of this stay order the registration, importation,

marketing, distributing and even administering to patients of the 5th

Respondent's drug has been stopped. The sale of the Petitioners' drug is

being continued. The only change, the vacation of the stay order will bring

about, would be the resumption of sale of 5th Respondent's drug 'Hertcad'.

Would such a move render a final order nugatory if the petitioner is

successful? The answer is obvious. It is in the negative form.

Where does the balance of convenience lie?

It could be seen from the pleadings filed by the 3rd Respondent that since

the granting of this interim relief it has become impossible to administer

this drug on patients suffering from cancer both at the Cancer Institute

Maharagama and other hospitals. The documents marked 3R4 and 3R6

12

have clearly shown the inconvenience that has caused to the general

public. The affidavit filed on behalf of the 3rd Respondent setting out the

statics in this regard demonstrates the need for affordable breast cancer

drug particularly to the under-privileged segment of cancer patients of this

country.

To the contrary what do the Petitioners achieve by the stay order being in

place? Basically there are two things. They are as follows.

I. It stops the sale of the 5th Respondent's drug at the inconvenience

caused to the general public.

II. It enhances the sale of the Petitioners' drug and would in the process

establish a monopoly for it.

This shows that the balance of convenience of the parties to this dispute is

clearly tilted in favor of the 1st - 3rd and the 5th Respondents. Indeed it is

not a question of balance of convenience, it is just that the Petitioners

cannot and should not be permitted to achieve the above results by an

interim order issued by this court in a Writ application.

Will irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to either party?

The question that one should ask at this moment is whether an irreparable

or irremediable damage would be caused to the Petitioners by not stopping

the sales of the 5th Respondents drug? Answer is obviously no. Because a

mere drop in sales of the Petitioners' drug cannot be taken as irreparable

or irremediable mischief or damage caused to the Petitioners.

f I ! f I

I t !

13

It is also relevant and is necessary to examine'the interim reliefs that the

petitioners have asked for, from this court in the light of the final reliefs

they have claimed from this court.

The final prayers of the petitioners inter alia are as follows.

1. for a writ of Certiorari quashing the registration and/ or the decision

of the 1st Respondent to register the product "Herticad" and/ or the

license to import and market the same;

2. for a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent from granting

any extension of provisional registration and/ or granting a full

registration for the product "Herticad" and/ or license to import and

market the same;

3. for a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to cancel the

purported registration or provisional registration of the product

"Herticad" ;

4. for a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent from granting

a provisional or full registration for the product "Avegra" and/ or a

license to import and market the same;

5. for a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 2nd Respondent from

purchasing, or proceeding with any purported contract for

purchasing, the product "Herticad" for administering to patients in Sri

Lanka;

The interim reliefs that the Petitioners have prayed for are as follows.

I

I !

i J

14

I. staying and/ or suspending the registration and/ or the

provisional registration and/ or any license to import and

market the product "Herticad";

II. Preventing the 1st Respondent from registering the product

"Avegra" ;

III. preventing the 2nd Respondent from purchasing, or proceeding

with any purported contract to purchase the product "Herticad"

for administering to patients in Sri Lanka;

IV. preventing the Respondents from importing and/ or distributing

and/ or administering or causing to be administered, the

product "Herticad" to patients in Sri Lanka;

As has been shown in the written submissions7 filed by the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents, it

could be seen that the interim reliefs that the petitioner has prayed for, are

similar to his final prayers. What the petitioners have done by obtaining the

interim reliefs, has amounted to obtaining their final reliefs even without

noticing the respondents from day one. This has never been, and should

not ever be, the purpose which the Rules8 are expected to serve.

Learned counsel for the 4th Respondent stated to this court that he is

supporting the extension of the operation of the interim relief granted by

this court. However the basis upon which he asserts that, has not been

7Pages 3 & 4 of the written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents 8Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

! ! I i I

It

15

made clear. The 4th Respondent has not filed any statement of objections.

He has nevertheless filed written submissions. In that written submissions

the 4th Respondent has stated inter alia,

I. that he is not an aggrieved party,

II. that he does not intend to oppose the interim order that has been

issued,

III. that the Petitioner's drug is time tested and long used one,

He has stated in his written submission a considerable number of other

facts as well.

It is strange that the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent has been able

to narrate a series of facts pertaining to the issues under consideration as

the 4th Respondent has neither filed a statement of objection nor filed any

affidavit. It is to be observed that even the assertion that "the 4th

Respondent or the College of Oncologists by no means is seeking to

promote the Petitioners' drug Herceptin or encourage a monopoly for

them" has not been supported by any affidavit and thus it is not difficult for

this court to reject it totally. Similarly all those factual positions narrated by

the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent must also be rejected as they

clearly amount to either hearsay material or mere third party's opinions of

a given set of facts. Such opinions should not have a place in these

proceedings as this court is not interested in the opinions of third parties

about the issues that it ought to consider in a case before it. The

entitlement of 4th Respondent's counsel is only to represent his client and

,. 16

act in court to safeguard his client's interests. H.e should not be entitled to

either attack or assist any other party's factual position or interest without

first taking up a position in that regard in his pleadings. Such a factual

position has to be supported by an affidavit also. Further this Court cannot

see any justification as to why the Petitioners have made the President, of

the College of OncologiSts, a party to this proceedings, in view of the

statement by the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent that "it is not a

party against whom relief has been sought and is not an agrieved party"g.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the 1st - 3rd and the 5th

Respondents that the affidavit filed with the petition is not an affidavit of

persons who could speak to the alleged material facts set out in the said

affidavit from their personal knowledge. This issue has been raised by the

learned counsel for the 1st - 3rd and the 5th Respondents as a preliminary

objection and that issue, if proven, would go into the very root of this case

as it is against Rule 3(1)(a) which has been held to be mandatory.

Further, the arguments advanced on behalf of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd and the

5th Respondent that

a. the Petitioners action amounts to a collateral attack on the decision

to award the tender to the 5th Respondent but presented in the guise

of a writ application

b. there is no legally protectable right that has been infringed by the 1st,

2nd and 3rd and the 5th Respondents in this case

9 Paragraph 01 of the Written Submission filed by the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent.

17

appear to this court to be sensible arguments which this court will have to

go into carefully. Although this court does not intend to make findings on

all the arguments advanced by the parties it is appropriate to mention here

the very presence of this type of arguments show that this is not a case in

which the Petitioners should have obtained interim reliefs referred to

above, exparte.

Having that in mind, it would be helpful for this court to look back, to

identify the background in which this court had made an order granting the

interim reliefs, at the first instance. This exercise must be done in the light

of the legal regime governing the granting of such interim reliefs.

Rule 2(1) of The Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 is the

main rule deals with the granting of interim reliefs. It is as follows.

Rule 2(1)

"

a) Every application for a stay order, interim injunction or other interim

relief (hereinafter referred to as 'interim relief) shall be made with

notice to the adverse parties or respondents ( hereinafter in this rule

referred to as ' the respondents ') that the applicant intends to apply

for such interim relief; such notice shall set out the date on which the

applicant intends to support such application, and shall be

accompanied by a copy of the application and the documents

annexed thereto:

b) Provided that -

.. 18

a) interim relief may be granted although such notice has not been

given to some or all of the respondents if the court is satisfied that

there has been no unreasonable delay on the part of the applicant

and that the matter is of such urgency that the applicant could not

reasonably have given such notice; and

b) in such event the order for interim relief shall be for a limited period

not exceeding two weeks sufficient to enable such respondents to be

given notice of the application and to be heard in opposition thereto

on a date to be then fixed. . .. "

In interpreting this rule, one must be mindful that Rule 2(1) has

made it mandatory that,

a) all parties who would likely to get affected adversely by

granting of such interim relief must be made respondents to

the application,

b) every application for an interim relief shall be made with notice

to the adverse parties or respondents.

c) the notice must communicate to the respondents the intention

of the petitioner to support such application.

d) the notice must be accompanied by a full set of material that

the petitioner intends to rely on.

It could also be seen that Rule 2(1) is a rigid one and that any petitioner

supporting an application for interim relief must do so with notice to the

respondents. This meaning could be gathered from the presence of the

word 'shall' in Rule 2(1). It clearly indicates that giving notice to the

19

respondents is mandatory and stands as a pre requisite to supporting an

application for interim relief. Any applicant for interim relief must therefore

necessarily comply with it. It is not open for anyone to deviate from that

provision.

There is however a proviso to this rule. It has to be borne in mind that

Rule 2(1) is the rule proper and Rules 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) only serve as

proviso's to the rule proper. The effect of the proviso is that court may

grant interim relief "although such notice has not been given to some or all

of the respondents" only when it is satisfied of the following two things.

They are,

I. that there has been no unreasonable oelay on the part of the

applicant in giving such notice referred to in Rule 2(1)(a), and

II. that the matter is of such urgency that the applicant could not

reasonably have given such notice

A closer look at the Rule 2(1)(a) shows that the presence of a solitary, yet

important word 'and' therein, insists that a petitioner must satisfy both the

above conditions.

It is the fervent wish and the right expectation of courts that the

Petitioners filing applications for discretionary reliefs come to invoke the

powers of court without ulterior motives on their part. This expectation

assumes a greater importance particularly when a petitioner is seeking the

court to invoke the extraordinary powers given to it in terms of Rule

2(1)(a).

Thus the Petitioners making an ex parte application, supporting it and

obtaining interim reliefs in this case with a deliberate ignorance of giving

notice to the Respondents in the circumstances of this case is definitely

very much more than 'a reasonable delay' which is excusable under Rule

2(1)(a).

The Petiotioners had 07 days' time gap between filing of this case and the

date on which it actually supported it in court. There was sufficient time for

the Petitioners to give notice to the Respondents if they were seriously

interested in complying with Rule 2(1). However the Petitioners have

chosen not to comply with that Rule.

Brown & Co. Ltd. and another Vs. Ratnayake, Arbitrator and otherslO is a

case where the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of an application for a Writ

on the basis of a failure on the part of the petitioner in that case to annex

to the petition, certified copies of relevant proceedings with regard to the

particular dispute. The Supreme Court referring to Rule 46 of the Supreme

Court Rules of 1978 which required the petition to be supported by

affidavit and to be accompanied by original or duly certified copies of

documents material to the case in the form of exhibits stated thus " .... The

Rule itself is a commonsense response to litigants wanting the disturbance

of an order or award. It is no more than a normal procedural step deemed

necessary to inform both court and respondents of the matters of

complaint. It is consistent with ordinary practice. One cannot claim a right

11994 (3) SLR 91

I I ,

; ! I ! t

t

21

to proceed to the next step without compliance with a valid invocation of

jurisdiction in the first place. Such would lead to uncertainty,

unreasonableness and oppressive results. In this sense the rule is

mandatory .... ,,11

Thus the message we could get from the above judgment in so far as we

could apply to the circumstances of the instant case is that the Rules must

be followed in order to avoid uncertain, unreasonable and oppressive

results.

Subsequent to this inquiry it has now become clear that this is not an

instance in which this court should have acted under the proviso to the

Rule 2(1). In the face of severe criticism by the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the

learned President's Counsel appearing for the 5th Respondent, the

Petitioners have not offered any explanation as to why they had chosen

that path to obtain this order.

As has been shown before, Petitioners were duty bound to comply with the

Rules particularly when they have asked for interim reliefs from this court.

There is an additional burden on the Petitioners in this case to comply with

these rules due to the hardships that an order for interim reliefs so widely

drafted would cause to the patients in government hospitals suffering from

cancer.

What has come to light now is that this court would never have granted

this order if it had the benefit of an inter parte inquiry. In the absence of

l1(Ibid) at page 100

..

22

any explanation by the Petitioners this court. has no alternative but to

conclude that the Petitioners have deliberately refrained from giving notice

to the respondents about their intentions to apply for interim reliefs. Such

conduct in the circumstances of this case amounts' to a breach of

uberimmae fides on the part of the Petitioners in their run up to achieving

an order from this court for interim reliefs. This Court needs to stress that

the requirement of uberimmae fides on the part of Petitioner has been

recognized over and over again as being of paramount consideration when

a court considers the granting of interim reliefs.

For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the interim order issued by this

court as per prayer (h) of the Petition should not be extended. The said

interim order must be vacated and dissolved forthwith. Registrar of this

Court should take steps to inform this decision to the 1 st,2nd, 3rd and 5th

Respondents immediately.
