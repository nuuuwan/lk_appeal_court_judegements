On 31.08.2015, following a trial before a Judge, the

Accused-Appellant was

Imprisonment, and Rs. 5000 as a fine and carry1ng

a default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment,

1n respect of the 2nd count in the indictment.

The conspectus of the relevant facts are as follows;

The incident pertaining to the crime revolves on a

sudden fight due to provocation, aggressor being the

deceased. As claimed by the Accused- Appellant the

deceased had taunted the Appellant by following him

by getting in to the same bus after an altercation

between the parties.

Further he had witnessed the Accused stabbing the

posterior of the Deceased, and 1n the process he

too was stabbed.

It 1S salien t to note that

deducible from the evidence

the provocative act

of the Appellant 1S

that while the Deceased and two others were

getting down from the bus the Deceased had

dragged him down from the steps where he was

standing and allowing them to get down from the

bus. The Accused -Appellant gave evidence on oath

and testified to the above and had further stated

that the Deceased had a knife with him and 1n

self defence he grabbed the knife and dealt some

blows, and stabbed the above witness (the injured)

too.

In the course of the trial it transpired that the

Accused - Appellant also received 1nJunes as a

result of this attack. Nevertheless he was not

produced before a Medical Officer by the

in vestigating officer.

The counsel for the Accused- Appellant had adverted

court to the fact that the prosecution has led only

the evidence of the injured, although it was possible

to fortify their case by calling another eyewitness

namely Nimal, and also the driver of the bus 1n

which both parties were travelling.

Further it IS contended by the counsel for the

Accused- Appellant that he has gIven plausible

reason for his conduct after the alleged incident.

In the wake of the above it IS ostensible that the

deceased was

due to a sudden fight which occurred due to

sudden provocation. The provocative act deducible

from the evidence of the Accused -Appellant was

that, by inadvertently having trampled the deceased's

foot.

In the above setting the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant urged that the Accused could be convicted

for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on

the basis of grave and sudden provocation or

sudden fight. Further it IS noted that the Counsel

for the Respondent also

State that the facts emerged from evidence of this

of the Penal Code and not under Section 296 of

the Penal Code.

The evidence transpired In the course of the trial

also established the fact that there was no

prevIOUS enmity between these two parties.

The Leaned SSC has adverted court to the Doctors

testimony who held the post mortem of the

deceased and examination carried on the injured

party. It IS also seen from the MLR that there

was only one stab injury. Further the state has

admitted that there was no evidence to establish

that the Accused- Appellant has acted In a cruel

manner.

In the above setting it IS the position of the State

that the Accused- Appellant has acted In the heat

of paSSIOn caused by a sudden fight and hence it

IS stated that the 1 st charge against the Accused-

Appellant come within the ambit of exception 4 of

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

There are host of decided judicial decisions which

has recognised the commuting the death sentence

to a life imprisonment or culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

Even if there has been an interval between

provocation and the act of murder and the evidence

established that all the time during the interval the

accused suffered a loss of self control. In such

5

situation the proper verdict should have been a

conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to

murder and not for murder punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code. It was so held in

the case of SAMATHAMBY.VS. THE QUEEN-75.

NLR-49

Further it IS pertinent to note that the above

exposition of the law and facts only warrants a

conviction for a lesser culpability, VIZ culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the ground

of sudden provocation/ sudden fight.

This position IS explicitly stated In the Exception 4

to Section 294 of the Penal Code, which states

thus;

"Culpable homicide IS not murder if it IS committed

without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat

of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the

offender having taken undue advantage or acted in

a cruel or unusal manner"

Explanation -I t IS immaterial In such cases which

party offers the provocation or commits the first

assault.lt is also pertinent to note that the alleged

incident was of consequence of a sudden chance

meeting, and therefore no premeditation or

preparation for the act could been imputed under

the circumstences.

imposed in the event of failure to pay the fine will run

consecutively and will be operative from the date of

this judgment, 28.11.2016.

Subject to the above variation appeal 1S dismissed.

Accordingly we dismissed the appeal.
