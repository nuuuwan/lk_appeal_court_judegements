Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter called and referred to

as the Appellant) has preferred this Appeal to challenge the propriety of the

Judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura,

dated 26.04.2006, which dismissed the application made to the said High

Court to revise the Order of the learned Magistrate Anuradhapura, dated

05.07.2005.

The facts that have given rise to the present application are briefly as

follows:

One W.A.D. Saman Wasantha Milroy, who was the accused in Case

No. 56739, was charged in the Magistrate's Court of Tambuttegama on three

charges namely:

(i) Committed an offence under Section 2(1 )(b) of the Cruelty to

Animals Act by transporting 10 pigs in a manner of causing

pain to them;

(ii) committed an offence under Section 23( c)( 1) of the Animals

Act by transporting 10 pigs from one district to another without

a transport permit, and

(iii) committed an offence under Section 6 of the Animals Act by

not furnishing a return to the Government Veterinary Surgeon,

Anuradhapura, regarding the transporting of animals.

The accused pleaded guilty to the aforesaid charges leveled against

him and accordingly the learned Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs.l 00/-on

the 1 st Count, Rs.200/- on the 2nd Count and Rs.200/- on the 3rd Count.

Thereafter an inquiry was held regarding the confiscation of the

vehicle bearing No.48 - 6738 and at the end of the inquiry the learned

Magistrate confiscated the vehicle on the basis that the registered owner had

not been able to prove and satisfactorily convince that the vehicle had been

used for the commission of the offence without his knowledge and that he

had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence.

In this case the Appellant is the registered owner of the vehicle.

Being aggrieved by the said Order he moved the High Court of

Anuradhapura in revision of the aforesaid Order, but the learned High Court

Judge by his Order dated 26.04.2006, dismissed the Petition of the Appellant

affirming the learned Magistrate's Order dated 05.07.2005. Being aggrieved

by the said order of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellant has

preferred this appeal.

At the hearing of this Appeal, it was the first stance of the Counsel for

the Appellant, that there is no provision in the Cruelty to Animals Act for the

confiscation of a vehicle. The second stance was, although the Magistrate

has the power to confiscate a vehicle on the 2nd and 3 rd charges according to

the definition given in the schedule of the Animals Act, transport of "Pigs"

without a permit or return from the Government Veterinary Surgeon, is not

an offence under the Animals Act.

5

I will now consider the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel

for the Appellant in support of his contentions.

The sole question that arises for consideration III this appeal is

whether transporting of "pigs" without a transport permit or a return from

the Government Veterinary Surgeon is not an offence under the Animals Act

and whether "pigs" come within the purview of "Animals" under the

definition of Animals Act No. 29 of 1958.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has drawn the attention of this

Court to the schedule of the Animals Act. In that schedule the word

"Animal" has been defined as follows:

"Animal means neat cattle (ela haraka) or a buffalo and in Part

(IV) includes a sheep, goat, pig or poultry".

It is relevant to note that the 2nd and 3rd charges have been framed

against the Accused under Part II of the Animals Act which relates to the

slaughter and transport of Animals. On examining the definition given to

the word "Animal" in the Animals Act, "Animal" means neat cattle (ela

haraka) or a buffalo, and in Part (IV) includes a sheep, goat, pig or

poultry.

In view of the aforesaid definition, I am of the view that, for the

transportation of pigs there is no requirement to obtain a transport permit or

a return from the Government Veterinary Surgeon.

A careful examination of Part (IV) of the Animals Act clearly shows,

it deals with "Trespass by Animals" which has no relevancy to this case.

6

Hence it is the view of this Court, that there is no conformity with the

provisions of the Animals Act and the charges framed in the Magistrate's

Court.

On perusal of the entirety of the Judgment it is apparent that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to take cognizance of the law set out in

the Animals Act and failed to consider the provisions of the Animals Act.

The learned High Court Judge has considered only the legality of the order

made by the learned Magistrate in relation to the confiscation of the vehicle.

Hence, I am of the view, that the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected in law in affirming the Order of the learned Magistrate.

Taking into consideration all these matters, it is my considered view

that the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge and the Order of the

learned Magistrate cannot stand.

F or the foregoing reasons, I allow the Appeal and accordingly set

aside the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 26.04.2006 and

the Order made by the learned Magistrate dated 05.07.2005.
