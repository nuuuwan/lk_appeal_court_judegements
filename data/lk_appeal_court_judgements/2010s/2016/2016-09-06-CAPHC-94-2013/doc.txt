P.R. WALGAMA, J.

The short point for consideration in this appeal emanates

from the petition of the Petitioner- Appellant( Registered

Owner of the vehicle in issue).

Two accused named In the plaint, filed by the Ranged

Forest Officer in the case bearing No. 841/10 in the

Magistrate Court of Kegalle, was charged with transporting

illicit timber without a valid permit, and there by

committing an offence for violating section 24 of the Forest

Ordinance No. 56 of 1979, amended by Act No. 13 of

1982 I Act No. 84 of 1988 and Act No. 23 of 1995.

At the very inception the Accused pleaded guilty to the

said charge, and a fine of Rs. 15,000/ was imposed and

the Learned Magistrate has fixed the case for inquiry

~ regarding the vehicle for 04.06.2010.

It is seen from the journal entry that on the day fixed

for the inquiry, as the Petitioner-Appellant was absent the

Learned Magistrate has made order confiscating the vehicle

in terms of Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance.

Being aggrieved by the said confiscation order the Petitioner

-Appellant has come by way of revision to the Provincial

High Court holden at Kegalle to have the said impugned

order set aside.

The shortly stated facts In the petition to the Provincial

High Court state thus;

That on the day fixed for the inquiry whether the vehicle

should be released to the owner, the petitioner was unable

be in court, according to him that there was a breakdown

in the said vehicle and in proof of the said fact the

Petitioner- Appellant has tendered a receipt marked P3 which

is the payment made for the repairs done to the vehicle

in issue.

In challenging the -said position of the Petitioner -Appellant . it IS the position of the Respondents that the Petitioner

has not acted with due care and responsibility as he has

not taken any step to inform even his lawyers as to the

delay. Further it is submitted that the Petitioner him self

should have been present in court to explain to court in

fact what happened to the vehicle.

The Learned High Court Judge having considered the facts

placed before court was of the view that the Petitioner-

Appellant has failed to aver exceptional circumstances which

warrants the High Court to exercise this extraordinary

power, and had rightly dismissed the revision application

accordingly.

To impugned the order of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 10.07.2013 the Petitioner- Appellant appealed to this

Court to have the said order set aside.

It was the contention of the Petitioner -Appellant that his

absence was due to the mechanical defect in the vehicle

that occurred on his way to Court.

It is reiterated by the counsel for the Respondents in her

submissions that the order of the Learned High Court Judge

is unattended in error as the revisionary power vested in

the Provincial High Court, the exercise of which will take

place only on exceptional circumstances attended thereto.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents has adverted

Court to the judicial decisions stated herein below;

THILAGARATNEM .VS. E.A.P. EDIRISINGHE- (SRI L.R. 1982 VOL (I)

\ page 56) has observed thus;

"though the Appellate Courts powers to act in revision

were wide and would be exercised whether an appeal has

been taken against the order of the original court or not

such powers would be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances".

Further in the case of ATTORNEY GENERAL .VS.

GUNAWARDENA (1996) 2 SLR 149 page 156- has expressed

thus;

"Revision like an appeal, is directed towards the correction

of errors, but it is supervisory in nature and its object is

the due administration of justice and not, primarily or

solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An appeal IS

a remedy, which a party who is entitled to it ,may claim

to have as of right and its object is the grant of relief to

a party aggrieved by an order of court which is tainted

by error".

It is also contended by the Counsel for the Respondents

that the document marked P3 was tendered by the

Petitioner- Appellant only after 4 days of the inquiry, and

8

/ i

I l i :'

said document was never produced before the Magistrate

Court. Therefore it is contended by the Counsel for the

Respondent that the Learned High Court Judge was correct

in not accepting the said document as it was a new

material tendered to court.

It was also observed by Court that this the appeal was

rejected as the Appellant did not pay the brief fees, but

nevertheless, on an application made subsequently to have

the said appeal restored the court has accordingly has

restored the same.

Therefore it is contended by the Counsel for the

Respondent that through out the Appellant has been

negligent and careless in prosecuting this matter.

When reviewed the facts in the said back drop it is

abundantly dear that there is no valid reason to set aside

the orders of the Learned Magistrate and the Learned

High Court Judge.
