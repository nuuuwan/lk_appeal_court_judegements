JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Government agent of Anuradhapura has by the document marked and

produced as P 1 (b) has granted a long term lease of lot 514/ A2

comprising A;O, R;2, P;O in extent in favour of the Petitioner for an

industrial purpose, in terms of the provisions of State Lands Ordinance.

While the above lease (as per P l(b)) remains valid the Provincial Land

Commissioner of the North Central Provincial Council, had issued the letter

dated 1990-02-21 produced marked 1 Rl, to the spouse of the Petitioner

purporting to cancel the said lease (as per P l(b)) and purporting to grant

him a lease in respect of lot no 514/ A2/ A1 comprising R;1, P;04.0 in

extent, which comprised a portion of lot 514/ A2. It would appear that this

sub division had been effected for the purpose of granting only a portion of

lot 514/ A2 on lease to the 4thRespondent. By the letter dated 1990-02-21

(produced marked 1 R3) the Provincial Lands Commissioner of the North

Central Provincial Council has purportedly granted the 4thRespondents a

f

lease in respect of lot 514/ A2/ A2 comprising A;O, R;l, P;O in extent,

which consists of the remaining portion of lot 514/ A2.

Since it is the Provincial Lands Commissioner who has granted the above

leases! it is necessary to examine the relevant provisions of law to

ascertain the legality of those actions, by the Provincial Lands

Commissioner.

According to Section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance it is the President who

has been empowered by the Ordinance to sell, lease or otherwise dispose

of state lands in the name or on behalf of the Republic, subject to the

provisions of the Ordinance and the regulations made there under.

According to section 105 of the Ordinance the President may, in such

manner and in such cases as may be prescribed, delegate to the Minister

or to the Land Commissioner or other prescribed officer any power or duty

conferred or imposed upon him or any authority vested in him or any

discretion or function entrusted or assigned to him by or under the said

Ordinance.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General drew our attention to the document,

marked and produced as 2 R3 to establish that the said power referred to

in Section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance has been delegated to the

Government Agent. This delegation has been effected by the Gazette

bearing No. 09/ 912 dated 1948-10-15 produced marked 2 R3 which

contains the rules made under sections 94 and 95 of the State Lands

Ordinance by the Minister of Lands. Regulation 24 therein states that any

delegation made under section 105 of the State Lands Ordinance must be

by way of a Gazette notification. Regulation 24 (2) read with the 3rd

schedule therein shows that it is to the Government Agent that the powers

vested in the President by virtue of section 2 (2) and section 2 (3) of the

State Lands Ordinance has been delegated to.

Hence it is manifestly clear that the Provincial Lands Commissioner of the

North Central Province is not the proper authority in law either to cancel or

grant a lease for the occupation of a state land. Thus the letter produced

markedl Rl dated 1990-02-21 and the letter dated 1990-02-21 produced

marked 1 R3 issued by the Provincial Lands Commissioner becomes invalid

in law.

The spouse of the Petitioner and upon his death the Petitioner, had

complied with terms and conditions contained in the lease by setting up

and running the said business of a garage.

The document marked P l(b) has been issued by the Government Agent

of Anuradhapura pursuant to a delegation made under the State Lands

Ordinance in conformity with the law.

The issuance of the lease to the 4th Respondent by the Provincial Lands

Commissioner of the North Central Provincial Council while P l(b) remains

valid is contrary to law.

The settlement proposed by the 3rd Respondent in the letter dated 2014-

05-23 produced marked P 13 is a settlement that has been proposed

without taking into account the applicable legal position. Although the 3rd

Respondent has stated in his letter P13 that he has considered the report

made by the Assistant Land Commissioner (legal) dated 2004-04-22 what

has been stated by the Assistant Land Commissioner (legal) in that report

is that the letter dated 1990-02-21 (by which a portion of the land has

been given on lease to the 4th Respondent; i.e. lot number 5141 AI 2) is

not a legally valid document and that the long term lease granted to the

petitioner by P l(b) cannot be cancelled or altered by such letters. Hence

it is clear that the letter issued by the 3rdRespondent giving certain

instructions to the Commissioner General of Lands is a letter that is

contrary to law. In these circumstances we issue a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decisions of the 3rd Respondent in the documents marked P 11

and P 13.

Writ of Certiorari is issued.
