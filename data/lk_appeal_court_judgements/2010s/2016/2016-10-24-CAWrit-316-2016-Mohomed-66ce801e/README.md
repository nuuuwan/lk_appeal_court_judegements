Act as amended against the Petitioners in respect of the land set out in the notice to quit

dated 23.08.2016 marked P-23 until the final hearing and determination of this

application.

g) Staying the operation of the notice to quit date 23.08.2016 marked P-23 until the final

hearing and determination of this application.

As observed by this court the Petitioners have come before this court complaining that the Notice

to quit dated 23.08.2016 issued by the lSI Respondent was made mala fide, capricious, arbitrary,

irrational, illegal, unlawful and unreasonable.

As revealed before this court the land referred to the said impugned document produced marked

P-23 before this court refers to a land bearing No. 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 which is three

roods and 37.23 perches in extent.

According to the Petitioners, they claim title to the said land, through their predecessors in title

and in support of this position the Petitioners have produced marked P-lO, P-13 and P-15 three

pedigrees setting out the title.

As revealed before this court the lSI Petitioner had purchased the land and premises depicted as

lot 1 in plan 9558 dated 10Ih April 2013 from one Mohomad Thahir Mohomad Sheerzy on

05.10.2013 for the price of Rs. one hundred and twenty five million.

According to the schedule to the said Deed of Transfer No. 1799 which is produced marked P-3,

the extent of the said land purchased by the Petitioner was three roods and thirty seven decimal

two three perches (AO-R3-P37.32).

In the said deed the said vendor Mohomad Thahir Mahmood Sheerzy had explained his title to

the said premises as follows;

"Where as the said vendor vide Declaration of Amalgamation No. 1622 dated 1ih April

2013 attested by the Notary Attesting these presents is seized and possessed of and is the

owner of the land and premises depicted as lot 1 in plan 9558 dated 18th April 2013

made by Gamini B Dodanwala Licensed Surveyor and morefully described in the

schedule here to."(Emphasis added)

It is further revealed that the second Petitioner to the present application had acquired an

undivided 640/15360 shares (subject to a maximum of 10 perches) of the vendors rights and

interest in the said land bearing No 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 from Ratnaweera Arachchige

Ranjith Illangarathne Rabel on 25th July 2014 for sum of Rs. Twelve million eight hundred and

sixty thousand.

The third Petitioner to the present application had acquired an 1125/30720 shares (5.65 perches)

of the vendors rights and interest in the said land bearing No 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 from

Mohomad Farouk Abdeen on 16th October 2015 for sum of Rs. eleven million three hundred

thousand.

During the submissions before this court the above named Petitioners have admitted that, the

land and premises referred to this case No. 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 was vested with the third

Respondent Colombo Municipal Council on i h October 1974 by its certificate of purchase for

nonpayment of rates.

The Petitioners further took up the position that, the said 3rd Respondent has passed a resolution

on 26th February 1985 to the effect that,

"It was revealed at the discussion that the council has no intention of holding on to this

property as the buildings thereon are occupied by about 27 families and the property was

6

vested for nonpayment of rates. The owners have appealed to give the property back to

them on humanitarian grounds."

and thereafter wrote to its claimants on 11th September that,

1. Council had recommended that the council give this property back to the rightful

owners after recovery of the dues to the council with warrant cost and Ministry

approval.

2. Respective claims will have to be established through courts in view of contradictory

nature of the claims.

As revealed before this court, the said claimants had thereafter gone before the District Court in

order to establish their rights and the District Judge of Colombo by his Judgment dated

27.01.2005 had decided the claims of two Petitioners and the 27 Respondents who took part in

the said action before the District Court.

It was further revealed before this court, that the said claimants had thereafter requested the

3rd Respondent to divest the land with them but the Petitioners could not establish before us, any

meaningful step taken by the 3rd Respondent to divest the said land and premises with the said

claimants.

As observed above, the decision which was conveyed by letter dated 11th September had two

conditions in order to divest the land in question namely,

1. Recovery of dues with warrant cost

2. Ministry approval

Even though the Petitioners submitted that their predecessors in title had paid all rates which was

due but could not submit whether the other requirements, namely the recovery of warrant cost

and Ministry approval had been obtained to divest the land.

It was further revealed before this court that the lSI Petitioner's predecessor in title had gone

before the District Court of Colombo in December 1985 making the 3rd Respondent and several

others including the predecessors in title to the other Petitioners before this court as Respondents

seeking an order against the 3rd Respondent to transfer No. 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 in the

name of the said Petitioner, but the said action was dismissed by the District Court. Being

dissatisfied by the said decision of the Additional District Judge Colombo, an appeal was lodged

before this court and the said appeal bearing No. CA. 68/88 (Final) was also dismissed by this

Court on 09.01.1995.

The Learned President's Counsel who represented the petitioners above named was heavily

dependent on legitimate expectation of the Petitioners above named when they have acquired the

title for voluble consideration in respect of the whole and/or part there of the subject matter to

the present application as referred to above and argued that the decision of the 3rd Respondent to

act under the provisions of the State Land Recovery of Possession Act No.7 of 1979 as amended

was made "mala fide, capricious, arbitrary, irrational, illegal, unlawful, unreasonable and ultra

virus the provisions of the State Land Recovery of Possession Act and the Municipal Council

Ordinance. In this regard the Petitioner took up the position that when the 3rd Respondent wrote

to the predecessors in title in the year 1985 that,

i. Council had recommended that this property be given back to the rightful owners

11. Respective claims will have to be established through courts

and based on the above request, when the Petitioners predecessors in title obtain a court

order from the District Court of Colombo determining the claims of them, the Petitioner's

predecessors in title had entertained an expectation which was legitimate mainly for the reason

that there was a promise given by the Public Authority, i.e. the 3rd Respondent.

However in this regard we are mindful of the fact that the promise referred to above was given

subject to several conditions.

When considering the material placed before this court by both parties it is observed by this court

that,

a) The Land and premises refereed to this case, No. 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 was vested

with the 3rd Respondent on i h October 1974 by its certificate of nonpayment of rates.

b) The 3rd Respondent by letter dated 111h September 1985 had informed its claimants that

the council had recommended to gIve the property back to the rightful owners on

recovery of all dues with warrant cost and Ministry approval

c) The Petitioner failed to satisfy this court that conditions to warrant tax and obtaining

Ministry approval are fulfilled when the Petitioner come before this court

d) The predecessor in title to the 1 SI Petitioner had gone before the District Court seeking an

order against the 3rd Respondent to transfer the land and premises in No. 43 Barnes Place,

Colombo 7 in his name whilst making several others including the predecessors in title of

the other two Petitioners but the said action was dismissed by the District Court and the

Appeal lodged against the said decision too was dismissed by this court in the year 1995

and no appeal was preferred to the Supreme Court against the said decision

e) lSI Petitioner's predecessor in title, and the vendor in deed 1799 which is produced

marked P-3 who is also the plaintiff in the District Court of Colombo 14479/L claimed

his title as,

"said vendor vide Declaration of Amalgamation No. 1622 dated lih April 2013

attested by the Notary attesting these presents is seized and possessed of and is the

legal owner of the land and premises depicted as lot 1 in plan No 9558 ....... "

When he was well aware that,

When he filed action in the District Court of Colombo seeking an order

against the 3rd Respondent to transfer the land and premises in No 43

Barnes Place Colombo 7 and the said action had been dismissed by the

District Court and the appeal there to was also dismissed by the Court of

Appeal

ii. The District Court in the case of 15002L had decided the claims between

two Petitioners and 27 Respondents who took part in the said proceedings

t) Both the vendors in P-ll and P-14 have only sold their rights and interest of the said land

when they were well aware

i. That the land and premises in No 43 Barnes Place, Colombo 7 was vested

with the 3rd Respondent on i h October 1974 by its certificate of purchase for

nonpayment of rates

ii. The 3rd Respondent Council had recommended to give to the property back

subject to conditions,

a. Payment of rates in arrears

b. Payment of warrant tax

c. Ministry approval

and that the condition (b) and (c) had not been fulfilled

iii. That the District Court action which was pending before the District Court of

Colombo seeking an order against the 3rd Respondent was dismissed by Court.

g) The 1 sl Petitioner had purchased lot 1 in plan 9558 which is in the extent of three roods

and thirty seven decimal two three perches from a vendor who claimed that he is the legal

owner of the said land when in fact the legal owner of the said land was the 3rd

Respondent when the said transaction had taken place on 10.04.2013.

10 , . Learned Counsel for the petitioners relied on several decision of this court as well as from the

Supreme Court in support of his case but we see no relevance of the said cases to the present

case before us.

When considering the material discussed above we see no merit in the application before us to

issue notice in the 151 instance and grant any interim relief as prayed by the Petitioners.

This application is accordingly dismissed.
