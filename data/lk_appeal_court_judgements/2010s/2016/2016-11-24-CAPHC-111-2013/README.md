his rights of appeal against the order of Learned High Court Judge of the Wayamba

Province Holden in Kurunegala.

This is a revision application filed by the second party Petitioner Appellant to set

aside the order dated 10105/2013 of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge of

Kurunegala in case No HCR 82/2009 and for relief as prayed for in the prayer of the

petition. The parties were allowed to tender their respective written submissions in

respect of the preliminary objections while fixing the matter for argument on

21107/2015. When considering the maintainability of this appeal it was contended

by the party of the first part Respondent Respondent that no right of appeal lies

against the judgment of the Learned Magistrate ofPillessa.

On a perusal of the record we find that the Complaint Respondent Respondent above

named filed a report on 27/04/2009 in the Magistrate's Court of Pilassa under the

provisions of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No 44 of 1979

stating that there has been a road dispute between the party of the first part

Respondent Respondent and the party of the second part Petitioner Appellant. As far

as the report is concerned the dispute being the road way over the Appellant's land

which is described in the schedule to the original affidavit of the Respondent. The

subject of the dispute relating to the existence of the road way as claimed by the first

part Respondent and intervenient Respondent's shown in the observation note

contained in the said report. The party of the first part claimed to a 10 feet wide road

way which the subject of the dispute on the basis of long standing usage of it. Upon

filing of the said report, the counsel for the party of the first part sought leave from

court to add names of the 1-8 persons as the intervenient parties to the party of the

first part. Upon filing of their respective affidavits, the parties agreed to explore

possible settlement and contesting parties consented and agreed to dispose the matter

in dispute upon site inspection by the court.

The Learned Magistrate after inspection made an order under section 69 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act declaring that the party of the first part and intervenient

parties of the first part are entitled to enjoy or use 2 feet wide road(foot path) in

question over the party of second part Petitioner Appellant's land.

However being aggrieved by this order, the party of the second part Petitioner filed

the revision application before the High Court of the Wayamba Province Holden in

Kurunegala bearing No. HCRJ8212009. The Learned High Court Judge after hearing

the revision application delivered his judgment by refusing the revision application

on the grounds that no exceptional circumstances have been revealed to invoke the

revisionary powers of the High Court. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of High

Court the party of the second part Petitioner Appellant preferred the instant appeal

before this court to set aside the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge and the

consent order of the Learned Magistrate. Both parties have filed their written

submissions in respect of the preliminary objections raised by the party of the First

part Respondent Respondent. It was contended by the counsel of the First part

Respondent Respondent and 1-8 intervenient parties of the First part Respondent

Respondent that the Second part Petitioner has failed to tender relevant journal entry

containing the case record of the Magistrate Court of Pillessa at the time of filing

this revision application. It was submitted that the contesting parties have consented

and agreed to accept whatever outcome of the decision of the Learned Magistrate

after having agreed site inspection and contesting parties have signed the case record

signifying their consent for the site inspection by court.

The relevant portion of the judgment of Learned Magistrate is reproduced as follows;

"c5(:a) oaci6)(.)t5)~ ogC) qGJtj)O6)(.) 58~ ~~J @~a)

b)@(.)j(3)(.) (3:))0 (3)l63o g~Ja)@ ~C) ~~C)@~ 01 C)a) OJO~C)('), 01

C)Jo(:))C)o qo)o~ O)~) qlO)."

However the journal entry directing the signature of the parties has not been

tendered to this court.

Accordingly we hold that the party of the Second part Petitioner has failed to comply

with a rules Section 3(1) (a) and 3(1) (b) of Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure)

Rules 1990. As the journal entry is a vital document to this appeal.

In the case of Shanmugavadivu Vs. Kulathilake, Shirani Bandaranayake J,

2003 1 SLR 215 pg held that,

" On numerous occasions the Supreme Court as well as the Court of Appeal

have held that the compliance of the Supreme Court Rules and the Court of

Appeal Rules is imperative. In a situation where an application was made

to the Court of Appeal without the relevant documents being annexed to the

petition and the affidavit, but has stated the reason for such inability and

sought the leave of the court to furnish such documents on a later date, the

court could have exercised its discretion and allowed the Petitioner to file

the relevant documents on a later date. However on this occasion, as pointed

out earlier, no such leave was sought by the Appellant and in the

circumstances, the Court of Appeal could not have exercised its discretion

in terms of Rules 3(1) (a) and 3(1) (b) of the Court of Appeal (Appellant

Procedure) Rules."

When considering the objection raised there is no right of appeal against the

judgment of the Learned Magistrate Court ofPillessa.

It has been held as follows,

Babunhamy V. Andris Appu, Hutchinson C.J, 340 C.R. Galle 10008

"Plaintiff and defendant agreed to abide by the decision of the court,

arrived at after inspection, as to whether the plaintiff was entitled to a way

of necessity over the defendant's land or not. The commissioner after

inspection entered judgment for plaintiff. Held that the defendant had no

right to appeal against the judgment as he had agreed to abide by the

decision of the court."

Mudiyanse V. Loku Banda, Porter J, 24 NLR 190 pg

"Parties agreeing to Commissioner deciding case after inspection of

land without evidence-Appeal-Appeal from an order as to costs from

a court of requests.

Where parties agree to the Commissioner deciding a case without

hearing any evidence, but simply on an inspection of the land in

question, no appeal lies against the finding of the Commissioner.

No appeal lies from an order of the Commissioner as to costs."

Punchi Banda V. Noordeen, Akbar J, 30 NLR 481 & 482 pg

"Where the parties to an action in the court of requests agreed to abide

by the decision of the Commissioner after an inspection of the

premises in dispute.

Held, that no appeal lay from the decision of the Commissioner."

Accordingly we uphold the objections raised by the party of the First part

Respondent Respondent as to the maintainability of the instant appeal. As there is

no right of appeal against the judgment of the Magistrate Court ofPillessa. Further

as regard the revision application made to the High Court Judge of Wayamba

Province Holden in Kurunegala, we find that the High Court has erroneously

looked on the merit of the revision application to see, whether the exceptional

circumstances have been revealed or not which warrants exercise of revisionary

powers by the High Court.

Accordingly we hold that the instant application of the Second part Petitioner

Appellant cannot be maintained. We uphold the preliminary objections raised by

the party of the First part Respondent Respondent and 1-8 intervenient part of the

First part Respondent Respondent.

Accordingly we uphold the Preliminary objections referred to above and dismiss

this appeal with cost ofRs.lO,OOOI-.
