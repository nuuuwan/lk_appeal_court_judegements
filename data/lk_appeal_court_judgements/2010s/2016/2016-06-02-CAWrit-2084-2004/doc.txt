Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Petitioner in this case has sought an order in the nature of Writ of

Certiorari, quashing the decision of the 3rd Respondent dated 10.04.2003

contained in "P 16" whereby granting the possession in respect of the corpus

which is the subject matter of this proceedings and quashing the decision of

the 2nd Respondent dated 07.09.2004 contained in "P 17" whereby decided

to grant the entire portion of 24 perches to the 5th Respondent and a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1 st and / or 2nd and / or 4th Respondent to issue a

permit under the State Lands Ordinance in favour of the Petitioner.

The facts as tersely stated in the Petition are as follows:

The Petitioner is the Ampara Multi Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd.

and the successor in law to the rights and obligations of the Gal Oya Valley

Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Limited in the Ampara District.

The said Gal Oya Valley Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Ltd;

was registered under the provisions of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance

and encompassed all Co-operative Societies in the Gal Oya Valley.

4

It is averred by the Petitioner, with the promulgation of the Co-

operative Societies (Special Provision) Act No. 35 of 1970 and in terms of

the re-organisation provided therein, five Multi Purpose Co-operative

Societies were established in the area of operation of the said Union. These

were:

(i) Ampara M P C S (Petitioner);

(ii) Gal Oya Meda Palatha M PC S;

(iii) Weeragoda M PC S;

(iv) Uda Palatha M PC S;

(v) Inginiyagala M PC S.

Further it is averred by the Petitioner, that a liquidator was appointed

in terms of the said Act No. 35 of 1970 to supervise the dissolution of the

said Gal Oya Valley Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Ltd. The

said liquidator arranged for the distribution of the assets of the said Union

and transfer to the five new Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies in an

equitable manner. All properties belonging to the Gal Oya Valley Multi

Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Limited within the Town limits of

Ampara were transferred to the Petitioner.

The River Valley Board, leased the land which is described in

Paragraph 7 of the Petition, to the Gal Oya Valley Multi Purpose Co-

operative Societies Limited by indenture of Lease dated 07.10.1969.

It is alleged by the Petitioner, that on or about 23.08.1969, the 5th

Respondent (presently deceased) and his brother one Ulan Gamage

Premadasa, wrongfully and illegally entered the said land and dispossessed

5

the predecessor of the Petitioner. On or about 16.10.1969, the Gal Oya

Multi Purpose Societies Union instituted an action in the District Court of

Kalmunai seeking to eject the 5th Respondent (deceased) and his brother

from the said land. After trial, the Judgement of the said action was

delivered in its favour ("P 3"). An Appeal was made to the Supreme Court

but the said appeal was dismissed.

It is averred by the Petitioner accordingly, the said Gal Oya Multi

Purpose Societies Union became lawfully entitled to the possession of the

said land and the Petitioner was assigned to the rights of the said land by the

liquidator. (The letter is marked as "P 5").

It is alleged by the Petitioner that the 5th Respondent (deceased)

forcibly and illegally entered the said land on or about 04.03.1997 and

attempted to carry out unauthorised constructions. Later the Petitioner

became aware that by a permit, ("P 8 a") 1 7 .06 perches had been given to

the 5th Respondent (deceased). The Petitioner complained to the Divisional

Secretary at the time who informed the Petitioner by letter dated 12.03.1997

(Marked "P 8"), that inadvertently 1 7 perches had been given to the 5th

Respondent (deceased) in 1982 upon an annual permit (Marked "P 8a")

Thereafter the Petitioner filed a Writ Application in this Court bearing

No. 488/97, praying inter alia, for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the permit

issued to the 5th Respondent (deceased) and for a Writ of Mandamus

compelling the 1 st Respondent to issue an annual permit for the said land to

the Petitioner.

While this matter was pending the Divisional Secretary of Ampara by

his letter dated 05.07.1997 ("P 10") informed the 5th Respondent (deceased)

6

to stop all constructions and development on the said land. The 5th

Respondent (deceased) filed a Writ Application bearing No. 213/97 praying,

inter alia for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said Order of the Divisional

Secretary. The matters were settled after parties agreeing to make

representation before the 2nd Respondent.

The Divisional Secretary after due inquiry made an order ("P 12") that

the said allotment of land should be given to the Petitioner and the 5th

Respondent (deceased) be given an alternative land.

Once again the 5th Respondent (deceased) filed a Writ Application

No. 78112000, praying inter alia, to quash the said Order of the Divisional

Secretary. The Court made an Order ("P 14") directing the 3rd Respondent

to hold a fresh inquiry with regard to the dispute of the parties. The 3rd

Respondent had made an Order ("P 16") dated 1 0.04.2003 granting the

possession of the said land to the 5th Respondent (deceased).

It is alleged by the Petitioner that the said Order is unreasonable,

unlawful, and arbitrary and in violation of the principles of natural justice.

In contesting the above suit by the 1 st and 2nd Respondents by way of

objections state inter alia,

(i) Consequent to the filing of C A Application No. 78112000, as

both parties agreed to face another inquiry, the Court directed

the Divisional Secretary to hold a fresh inquiry.

(ii) The inquiry was held and it was transpired that the 5th

Respondent (deceased) was issued a permit (1 R 2) in the year

1982.

7

(iii) As it was evident that the Petitioner was never granted a permit

or has entered into a lease agreement in respect of the land in

question, it was recommended that the 5th Respondent

(deceased) should be given a permit according to the provisions

of Land Development Ordinance.

Further it is stated, for these reasons the Petitioner is not entitled for

the reliefs prayed for therein and accordingly the Petition ought to be

dismissed.

The 5th Respondent (deceased) whilst categorically denying the

Petitioner's allegations contended that the Petitioner who has had no right

over the land in dispute and who neglected to acquire the rights over this

land cannot now complain that the land had been given unlawfully to the 5th

Respondent (deceased).

It is the stance of the learned President's Counsel for the 5th

Respondent (deceased), that although the Petitioner relied on documents

"P 5", "P 6 ( a)" and "P 6 (b)" to prove that this land was assigned to the

Petitioner, that "P 5" has been wrongly interpreted by the Petitioner. It is the

contention of the learned President's Counsel, even though the liquidator of

the Gal Oya Multi Purpose Co-operative Society made requests to the

Petitioner repeatedly, to have the lease of the land transferred over to the

Petitioner, the Petitioner had not taken any action to do so. "P 5" is the last

available document where this request had been made to the Petitioner.

It is the contention of the learned President's Counsel since neither the

Petitioner nor the liquidator of the Gal Oya Multi Purpose Co-operative

II

rI

8

Society had occupied or developed the said land for a long period of time the

5th Respondent (deceased) had been issued a permit.

It is the stance of the learned State Counsel for the 1 S\ 2nd and 4th

Respondents, that the land in issue was occupied by the Gal Oya Multi

Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Ltd., purportedly on the basis of a

lease agreement entered into with the River Valley Development Board in

1969, the said Gal Oya Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Ltd.

was subsequently dissolved on or about 1971 and the liquidation process

was completed on 03.11.1983, along with the said dissolution and any

purported lease agreement would also be effectively terminated. As such, it

is the contention of the learned State Counsel, the Petitioner does not have

any title to the land in dispute, not having entered into a lease agreement or

been issued a permit or any other legal authority to be in occupation of the

property in issue.

In addition, in the written submissions filed in this Court by the

learned State Counsel for the 1 S\ 2nd, 4th and 6th Respondents, it was

contended that as "P 16" and "P 1 7" are only findings and not decisions or

determinations awarding rights to either party and thereby they are not

amenable for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari. It was further contended

that the Petitioner is not entitled to Writ of Mandamus as they have failed to

demonstrate any public duty or legal or statutory basis on which a Writ of

Mandamus could be sought.

At this juncture it is necessary to draw the attention to the documents

marked "P 16" and "P 17". "P 16" is a letter dated 10.04.2003 which had

been sent to the Hon. Attorney General by the 3rd Respondent, Divisional

t

9

Secretary of Ampara. By that letter the 3 rd Respondent has informed the

Hon. Attorney General that outcome of an order by the Court of Appeal

(Case No. 781/2000) an inquiry was held by him. The last paragraph of the

said letter ("P 16") reads as follows:

"@ ~@e) e)~3t:D6~ e)eD I.G. 8~)t5 e5)0)X), ~e:n6 ~el)e)ffie)OO)

~e)Q}~ I.G. 8~)t5 e5)00 5)Q}o) t::D(; G}ti} ~e)~ 1dt:D)(5) t:D6"

It is only a recommendation that the 5th Respondent (deceased) be

given a permit according to the Provisions of Land Development Ordinance.

"P 1 7" is a letter which had been sent to a Deputy Minister of

Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation by the 2nd Respondent, Divisional

Secretary of Ampara. It is a reply with regard to a letter which had been sent

by the Minister's Private Secretary.

The last Paragraph of the letter ("P 17") reads as follows:

"00e5)o) t) ~@ 1ffi5@~ 00 5)@G)5ei)0 ~~ffi e)eD ld)arlG3t:D

ffi6fOO~ @t:D)0 ~~eDO ~@ 5)@c:D(5) 00) ~~ffi ~e) t:D)6~3t:De) ~eDe) sa"

It is relevant to note that it would be the decision, which is mentioned

in "P 17" that is amenable for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari. It is

relevant to note that the said decision has not been submitted with the

Petition. "P 16" is also, only a letter / declaration, which cannot be

considered as any kind of decision and it is not amenable for the issuance of

a Writ of Certiorari.

Hence, in the premises aforesaid I have no difficulty in upholding the

contention of the learned State Counsel for the 1 S\ 2nd, 4th and 6th

Respondents that the application of the Petitioner is misconceived in law.

Without prejudice to the above decision it is significant to note that,

this is the 4th case filed in this Court with regard to the land in dispute. The

learned State Counsel for the 1 st, 2nd, 4th and 6th Respondents submitted that

the matter that is re-agitated before this Court is clearly Res Judicata and

accordingly, the Petitioner cannot maintain this application.

It is to be noted that "P 16" is an outcome of an Order of this Court

(Case No. 78112000). The Petitioner filed Case No. 488/97 seeking to quash

"P 9" and for a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1 st Respondent to issue a

permit to the Petitioner in respect of the said land. The 5th Respondent

(deceased) also filed a Writ Application seeking to quash the order "P 1 0"

made by the 2nd Respondent. The Court of Appeal, at that time ordered a

fresh inquiry before the 3 rd Respondent with consent of all parties. These

facts are admitted by the Petitioner too.

It is the stance of the learned State Counsel that, the final inquiry

report ("P 16") is an outcome of an Order of this Court and hence meets the

criteria for consideration in the context of Res Judicata and that the party

concerned has been vexed several times by the institution of successive

applications.

The learned State Counsel in support of the above submissions

referred to the Case of Nandawathie and Others vs. Tikiri Banda Mudalali,

11

(2003) 2 SLR 247. It was held in that case, that the principle of res judicata

to apply, the second action must be -

( a) Between the same parties;

(b) same subject matter; and

( c ) same cause of action.

It is the contention of the learned State Counsel that, the instant case

meets all of the aforesaid criteria and the matter is res judicata and cannot be

re-debated once again disputing the findings of a functionary made after an

inquiry held pursuant to an Order of Court.

It is trite law that the doctrine of res judicata precludes fresh

proceedings where there is a previous judicial decision on the same cause

between the same parties.

As the learned State Counsel has contended if the Court does not

apply the principle of res judicata, there will be no end to litigation.

It is in the public interest that there should be an end to litigation.

(Interest reipubiicae ut sit finis !itium.)

Hence, according to the facts of this case, the view of the Court is, the

principle of res judicate should apply in the instant case also.

At this juncture it is significant to note although this case has been

filed in 2004 argument was taken up in 2015. As such, it has taken twelve

years to conclude this case.

The next issue that should be considered IS as to whether the

Petitioner has any rights over the land in dispute.

12

In Paragraph (12) of the Petition it is stated that the Petitioner was

assigned to the rights of the land by letter dated 13.11.1979 ("P 5"), by the

liquidator and the Petitioner was in possession of the said land and has paid

taxes and rates in respect of the said land to the Ampara Urban Council.

It is the stance of the learned President's Council for the 5th

Respondent (deceased) that even through the liquidator made repeated

requests to the Petitioner to have the lease of the said land transferred over to

the Petitioner, the Petitioner has not taken any action to do so. Even though

the Petitioner claims the rights of the land on document "P 5", it is necessary

to draw the attention to the said document. It is mentioned in "P 5" as

follows:

e5.)0) ww @t:i)OO V e3wffi~O llo)e}o) t:i)6 (5)eDei) @~ @OOeD tffi@e}

On examining the document "P 5" it would thus be seen, although by

that letter, the Liquidator has requested to have the lease of the land

transferred, the Petitioner has not taken any steps to do so.

The Petitioner has not submitted any document to the effect that the

land in dispute was acquired by them. The Petitioner has wrongly

interpreted the document "P 5". It is relevant to note that the duration of the

lease has expired in 1987 and as such, I am of the view, that the Petitioner

has no rights whatsoever in respect of the land.

In the case of Biso Menika V s. C.R. De Alwis (S.C. 59/61)

Sharvananda J. (as he was then) stated, "a Writ of Certiorari is issued at the

J!

I

13

discretion of Court. It cannot be held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a

matter of course".

Halsbury, Volume 2 Pages 85 and 86, Simonds Edition: - "The grant

of a writ is as a general rule, a matter of discretion of the Court. It is not an

order granted as of a right and it is not issued as a matter of Course".

Accordingly, the Court may refuse the order, not only upon the merits but

also by reason of the special circumstances of the case.

It is relevant to note, that the facts emerged in this case do not show

that the documents "P 16" and "P 1 7" are amenable for the issuance of a

Writ of Certiorari.

In the given circumstances, the Petitioner is not entitled to seek a Writ

of Certiorari to quash the recommendation contained in documents marked

"P 16" and "P 1 7". As such the Petitioner is also not entitled to the Writ of

Mandamus as prayed for in the Petition.

Accordingly application is dismissed with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Application is dismissed with costs.
