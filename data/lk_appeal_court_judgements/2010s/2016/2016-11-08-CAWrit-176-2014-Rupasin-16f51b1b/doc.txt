Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

Saliya Pieris for the Petitioner

Chaya Sri Nammuni, Senior State Counsel for

Respondents

2016 - 10 - 17

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner had submitted an application for the post of Director

(Technical) in the 1st Respondent institution as per the circular dated 2013-

12-30, which is marked and produced as P 13 B.

The Petitioner had been informed of the date for interviews as 2014-02-28

and had been provided with a marking scheme along with a letter dated

. 19

2014-02-21 calling him for the interview. However, the Petitioner has

received at 4.10 pm on 2014-02-27 (the day prior to the date of the

interview) a different marking scheme which has been marked and

produced as P 14 A to P 14 C.

Allocation of marks at the interview was as follows:

a) Relevant additional administrative experience - 30 marks

b) Relevant additional professional qualification - 30 marks

c) Other achievements - 15 marks

d) Performance at the interview - 25 marks

Although several grounds of complaints have been put forward by the

Petitioner, it would be sufficient for this court to focus on his main

complaint of not being awarded 20 marks for the M. Sc. I MBA degrees

category in the marking scheme despite the fact that he had possessed a

degree of M. Sc. in Analytical Chemistry. Furthermore the Petitioner further

complained that the other ~andidates have been awarded the full marks of

20 for a similar degree.

20

According to P 14 C (under serial No.2 therein) maximum of 30 marks is

allocated for "relevant additional professional qualification" in following

apportions.

Post graduate diploma - 20 marks

M. Sc. / MBA

Ph D

- 20 marks

-30 marks

A note to the effect that "marks should be given only for additional highest

qualifications other than entry qualifications" has also been inserted in the

column under the heading "criterion" in the said marking scheme.

It is not in dispute in this proceedings that the Petitioner has a Master's

Degree (M. Sc.) in Analytical Chemistry and that he has not been allocated

any marks for that degree at this interview. Thus, it is now time to turn to

the explanation provided by the Respondents for their failure to award the

said marks to the Petitioner.

It is the position of the Respondents that having a Master's degree had

been considered as an "entry qualification" for the post Petitioner was first

appointed to the 1st Respondent institute (i.e. at the time he first joined)

21

The scheme of recruitment applicable at the time the Petitioner first joined

the'1 st Respondent institute has been marked and produced as R 1 and the

relevant portion therein has been marked as R 1 A.

The Respondents in their objections has also stated that the criteria for

selection was more appropriate and relevant to the institution and hence

was adopted with a view to select the correct candidate who would provide

a better service to the institute. 1

Further it was the position of the Respondents that the application of the

Petitioner was considered in strict compliance with a relevant scheme of

recruitment and marking scheme and according to his qualifications.2

It would now be appropriate to consider the criteria set out in the

document marked R 1 which is the criteria for recruitment when the

Petitioner was first recruited to the 1st Respondent institution.

"Grade VI

I. B.Se. Special degree in science

OR

II. B.Se. General degree in science with class

1 Para 2S (b) of the Statement of Objections

2 Para 28 (d) of the Statement of Objections

22

OR

III. B.Sc. General degree in science and Post Graduate

qualifications"

It could be seen that the Petitioner has been recruited under the category

III above, as he had possessed only an ordinary pass in the Bachelor of

Science degree.

"Post graduate qualification" could be a post graduate diploma also and

hence this category (III above) does not necessarily require a Master's

degree. All what it has insisted on, is a "post graduate qualification" in

addition to a B.Se. general degree in science. Thus, the post graduate

degree of M.Se. in Analytical Chemistry that the Petitioner possessed at the

time of his first entry into the 1st Respondent institution cannot be

considered as an entry requirement to that post as per R 1. Hence, it

would only be arbitrary to hold that an applicant to the post of Grade VI

Standards/Testing Offi~er was required by R 1 to possess a Master's

degree in science.

Further, the note in P 14 ~ to the effect that "marks should be given only

for additional higher qualifications other than entry qualifications" does not

23

shed light as to what "entry" it contemplates. Is it the entry to the

advertised post or is the entry to the first post of the employee?

If the 1st Respondent institution has insisted that any applicant for the

advertised post should have a Masters degree in science it would neither

be necessary nor logical for the interviewers to award marks for such entry

requirement.

Learned sse has considered that the minimum requirement to apply for a

post of Director is only 04 years experience as a Senior Deputy Director.

Thus the requirement of a Masters degree in science cannot be considered

as an entry requirement for the post advertised. Therefore a Masters

degree has to be considered as an "additional qualification". This is

substantiated by the fact that all the other applicants have been awarded

20 marks for the Masters degrees they possess.

It was the position taken up by the Respondents that the M.Sc. degree

obtained by the Petitioner was an entry qualification for the Petitioner to

join the 1st Respondent institute3, and the phrase "additional qualifications"

refers to the qualifications he has obtained ofter gaining employment and

3 paragraph 19 of the written submissions filed by the sse

24

thus excludes those that were considered for the first entry of that officer4

The rationale put forward by the learned sse for this proposition is the

desire of the 1st Respondent to ensure that its employees grow and acquire

not only experience but also additional academic qualifications within their

time at SLSI. Learned sse has also stated that the fact that marks are only

given in addition is an indication that efforts and skills shown academically

acquired at the time of their employment are appreciated and valued.

Even a person who holds a post graduate diploma is considered as an

applicant qualified to obtain 10 marks according to the marking scheme P

14 C. If the interpretation proposed by the learned sse is to be accepted

the resultant position would be that the petitioner who has a Master's

degree would get no marks while a person who only has a diploma would

get 10 marks.

If this court is to uphold the above argument it would only mean that the

intention of SLSI is to discourage people acquiring higher qualifications at

their earliest.

4 paragraph 31 of the written submissions filed by the sse

25

The persons who have been placed over the Petitioner appear to be those

who have acquired their M. Sc. degrees at a subsequent time according to

this argument. The Petitioner has been sidelined only because he had

acquired the same qualification well in advance. That, to say the least, is

very unfortunate.

For example, according to this argument, even if the Petitioner possessed a

Ph. D. degree at the time of his first entry, the 1st Respondent would not

recognize that as a post graduate qualification when it comes to his

promotions. The only wrong the Petitioner has committed is the acquisition

of the highest degree he could at the earliest opportunity. It is not possible

for this court to conclude that this is what the Sri Lanka Standards

Institution has been interested in maintaining as the standard.

Learned sse has also admitted that the Petitioner would not have been

sponsored by the SLSI under its scheme of sponsorships which would

enable the Petitioner to acquire another M. Sc. degree, since that scheme

of sponsorships for higher education is structured by the SLSI only to grant

opportunities for persons who have not obtained higher qualifications. 5

5 paragraph 24 of the written submissions of the sse

.-

26

In view of this, the deprivation of the 20 marks which the Petitioner ought

to have been given for his Masters degree, becomes an arbitrary decision

on the part of the interviewers.

Learned SSC has stated that the Petitioner never applied for the post of

Director (Laboratory Services) or Director (Metrology) and that therefore

he cannot pursue prayers (c) and (e).

Two posts namely Director (Metrology) and Director (Laboratory) fell

vacant and applications were called to fill those vacancies on 2014-10-25.

However the Petitioner did not apply for these positions at that time. The

Petitioner subsequently applied for the post of Director (Product

Clarification) which was advertised by the circular dated 2013-12-30. The

1 st Respondent conducted the interviews to fill the vacancies of all those

posts together including the post of Director (Scientific Standardization)

division which had fallen vacant after the applications have been

submitted. It was the position of the learned SSC that according to the

recruitment scheme selection of applicants to fill these vacancies must be

in order of merit which the scheme had wanted to adhere to.

'.

. .

27

After the interviews were conducted, 1ih - 20th Respondents had been

selected to fill the vacancies of these posts and the Petitioner had not been

selected.

1 ih - 20th Respondents had been appointed to the following Director

positions with effect from 2014-03-28:

a) 1ih Respondent - Director (Laboratory Service Division)

b) 18th Respondent - Director (Product Clarification)

c) 19th Respondent - Director (Metrology)

d) 20th Respondent - Director (Scientific Standardization Division)

Respondents who have been promoted have also been made parties to this

application. However they appear to have opted not to participate in this

proceedings.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we issue a,

a) mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

of the one or more or all of the 1st to 16th Respondents to select and

---~.-

".

28

promote the 1 ih Respondent to the post of Director (Laboratory

Services Division) as reflected by P 16;

b) mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

of the one or more or all of the 1st to 16th Respondents to select and

promote the 18th Respondent to the post of Director (Product

Clarification); as reflected by P 16;

c) mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

of the one or more or all of the 1st to 16th Respondents to select and

promote the 19th Respondent to the post of Director (Metrology); as

reflected by P 16;

d) mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

of the one or more or all of the 1st to 16th Respondents to select and

promote the 20th Respondent to the post of Director (Scientific

Standardization Division); as reflected by P 16;

29

The Petitioner has also asked for writs of Mandamus in prayers (g) ans (h).

Prayer (g) is to seek a writ of Mandamus on one or more or all of the 1st to

16th Respondents directing them to p~omote the Petitioner to one of the

three of the following posts in the 1st Respondent institution, namely

Director (Laboratory Services Division); Director (Product Certification);

Director (Metrology); Director (SCientific Standardization Division).

It is the submission on behalf of the Petitioner that the entire interview

process is unreasonable, arbitrary, contrary to the existing minute and the

selections made as a result of such process are not valid in law.

If the entire interview process has been an arbitrary one selection of any

applicant including the Petitioner cannot be done from such a process.

This court cannot perform the functions of the interviewers and selectors

and hence cannot decide at this stage whether or not the Petitioner should

be picked up for the post he had applied for. Therefore this court is not in

a position to issue a writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to

promote the Petitioner as has been prayed for in prayer (f) of the Petition.

..

30

The 1st-16th Respondents may take steps to call for applications and

conduct interviews afresh, to select suitable officers to be appOinted to the

above posts.
