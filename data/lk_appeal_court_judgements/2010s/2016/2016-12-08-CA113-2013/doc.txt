In this case the accused appellant was indicted under Sec. 365 (2)

(b) (2) of the Penal Code. The appellant was tried in absentia and after a

lengthy trial he has been convicted for the said offence and convicted for

12 years RI and imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000/=. The appellant was ordered

to pay Rs. 200,000/= as compensation for the victim.

The story of the prosecution is that on the day of the incident while

the victim was travelling in a school van owned by the accused appellant

she was sexually abused by the accused appellant. She has complained

to the mother and the mother has taken her to the police station from

where she has been produced before the Judicial Medical Officer. It

appears from the evidence that the victim's mother has confronted the

appellant before proceeding to the police station.

The victim has been 4 years at the time of the incident and she has

given evidence in the High Court when she was 11 years of age. Age of

the victim has not been disputed. We observe that she has been a

competent witness according to the Evidence Ordinance. Evidence of the

victim has been corroborated by the mother's evidence and the evidence

on the incident had been corroborated by the doctor's evidence.

2

The learned High Court Judge has evaluated at length the

evidence placed before court. There has been no contradictions which

went to the root of the case.

The defence has led the evidence of two witness who failed to cast

a doubt on the prosecution evidence. We find that the learned High Court

Judge has applied the tests properly and has rejected the evidence of the

defence.

F or the afore stated reasons we see no reason to interfere with a

well considered judgment ofthe High Court. Therefore we decide to affirm

the judgment and conviction dated 05/06/2013 and refuse the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
