This is an appeal against an Order made by the learned High Court

Judge of Keg aIle in the following circumstances.

On 28.l0.2013, a van bearing No. 50 Sri 7295 was produced by the

Officer in Charge Special Criminal Investigation Bureau of A vissaweIla,

before the Magistrate of A vissaweIla, together with a report stating, that one

W.G. Nihal Premathilaka had made a complaint that he is the owner of

vehicle bearing No. 50 Sri 7295 and at the end of April, he handed over the

said vehicle to a Car Sale namely Y.J. Enterprises at Aluthgama, Dehiowita

and requested to sell it for Rs. 1 ,250,0001-. The said Y.J. Enterprises

informed him that there is a Dolphin van bearing No. 250-2649, brought

5

there by a person called Mohamed Musees and there is an offer to exchange

his van 50 Sri 7295 with the Dolphin van. The complainant agreed to

exchange his vehicle with the Dolphin van and agreed to pay Rs.500,0001-

to said Musees in addition to the handing over of his vehicle. After settling

the money, Musees handed over the Registration Book of the said Dolphin

van bearing No. 250 - 2649 to the complainant. Thereafter he submitted the

Registration Book to the Department of Motor Traffic; he found that the

said Registration Book was a forged document. Subsequently, Badulla

Police came to the house of the complainant with Musees and had taken the

said van into the custody of the Police. It was revealed that the said Musees

had obtained the said Dolphin Van from its owner namely Thota Hewage

Chanaka Prasanna de Silva on an undertaking to pay its Hire Purchase

installments. Thereafter Musees had changed the Engine No. and the

Chassis No. and fabricated a fraudulent Vehicle Registration Book and sold

it to the complainant. The correct Number of the said Dolphin Van is 54 -

3654 and forged number is 250 - 2649. Fraudently, Musees had obtained

the possession of the van bearing No. 50 Sri 7295 belonging to the Appellant

and cheated Rs.l ,850,0001- from the complainant.

In the 3rd B Report filed by the Police it was stated that, after the van

bearing No. 50 Sri 7295 was taken from the complainant, by the said

Musees, had sold the van to one M.A. Priyanga Moris Perera for

Rs.850,0001- and said Priyanga Moris Perera had sold the van to one R.A.

Kushan Maduranga Nawaratna for Rs. 1 ,025,0001-.

The said van had been subsequently produced at the A vissawella

Police Station by the said Kushan Maduranga Nawaratna who claimed to be

the owner of the van having bought it from M.A.P. Moris Perera.

6

In accordance with an application made on that behalf by the Officer

in Charge of the Special Criminal Investigation Bureau, Avissawella, the

Magistrate ordered the van to be returned to W.G. Nihal Premathilaka,

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant). Since, R.A. Kushan Maduranga

Nawaratna also claimed the vehicle, the learned Magistrate had held an

inquiry before making the aforesaid order.

Aggrieved by the said Order R.A. Kushan Maduranga Nawaratna

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) sought to move in revision

against the said Order by Revision Application filed before the High Court

of Kegalle.

The learned High Court Judge, after having considered the

submissions and the documentary evidence produced before the Magistrate's

Court, set aside the learned Magistrate's Order allowing the Revision

Application filed by the Respondent; made an Order on 14.11.2014, that the

vehicle be handed over to the Respondent. Aggrieved by the said Order the

Appellant has preferred this Appeal seeking to set aside the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge and seeking to affirm the order made by the

learned Magistrate.

When this Appeal was taken up for argument on 08.09.2015, Counsel

for both parties made oral submissions and subsequently tendered written

submissions.

It is relevant to note, that the submissions made by both Counsel

involve an application of Section 431 (1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

7

Once a property is produced; which is a subject matter of criminal

offence, it is the duty of the learned Magistrate in terms of Section 431 of

the Criminal Procedure Code to make an order with regard to the possession

of the property. The Magistrate should decide whether the property should

be handed over to the person from whom the property was taken into the

custody of Court or whether the property should be given to any other party

other than the party from which the property is taken into the custody of the

Court, or the learned Magistrate could decide whether the property should be

kept under the custody of the Court.

Section 431 (1) and (2) reads as follows:-

431 (1). The seizure by any Police Officer of property taken under

Section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen or found under

circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any

offence shall be immediately reported to a Magistrate who shall

forthwith make such order as he thinks fit respecting the delivery of

such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if

such person cannot be ascertained respecting the custody and

production of such property.

(2) If the person entitled is known the Magistrate may order the

property to be delivered to him on such conditions (if any) as the

Magistrate thinks fit. If such person is unknown the Magistrate may

detain it and shall in such case publish a notification in the Court

notice - board and two other public places to be decided on by the

Magistrate, specifying the articles of which such property consists and

requiring any persons who may have a claim thereto to come before

8

him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such

public notification.

Sub-section (1) deals with three categories of property siezed by a

police officer namely;

(i) Property taken under Section 29 of the Code relating to

the search of persons who are arrested;

(ii) property alleged or suspected to have been stolen;

(iii) property found under circumstances which create a

suspicion of the Commission of any offence.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the mam

complaint in the present case was, that the Accused (Musees) fraudently had

obtained the possession of the vehicle belonging to the Appellant together

with money, whereby had cheated Rs.1,850,0001- from the complainant.

The Counsel submitted that the offence has been committed by using the van

and the money of the complainant and the subject matter of the offence is

the van bearing No.50 Sri 7295. It is the stance of the learned Counsel that

although the van in question was taken into the custody of the Police from

the Respondent, before the offences referred to in B report were committed,

the van was in the custody of the Appellant. The learned Counsel for the

Appellant contended that, the learned Magistrate having taken into

consideration all these facts and the decision of Silva vs. O.I.C.

Thambuttegama (1991) 2 S.L.R. 83, correctly made an order to release the

vehicle to the Appellant subject to a Surety Bond ofRs.2,000,0001-.

It is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, when

allowing the Revision Application filed by the Respondent the learned High

9

Court Judge had not considered the relevant law and the authorities cited

before him in the correct perspective; thereby had erred in law.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent contended, it IS an

undisputed fact that the vehicle bearing No. 50 Sri 7295 was taken over by

the police from the Respondent and he was the registered owner of the

vehicle at the time Police seized it; had been subject to leasing facility from

the Senkadagala Finance Limited who was the absolute owner of the vehicle

which is the subject matter of this case. It is the stance of the Counsel that

the learned Magistrate has misinterpreted and misconceived the judgment in

Silva vs. O.I.C. Thambuttegama; but the learned High Court Judge has

correctly analysed and interpreted it and pronounced his judgment.

It is important to realise that Section 431 is not a provision which

confers jurisdiction to decide disputed claims to possession. Its object to

provide for the Magistrate being brought with the least possible delay into

official touch with the property seized by the Police (Binduwa vs Tyrrell 4

C.A.C.l)

It is conceded that Section 431 sub section (1) is the section under

which the learned Magistrate was empowered to make an order in these

circumstances. That section enacts that the "Magistrate ..... shall make such

order as he thinks fit respecting the delivery of such property to the person

entitled to the possession thereof ... "

A further aspect in Section 431 which is significant, is the element of

discretion vested in the Magistrate. However, the discretion thus given to

10

the Magistrate should be exercised judicially. This element of discretion is

manifest from the use of the words "as he thinks fit" in sub section (1) and

the words "the Magistrate may order the property to be delivered to him" in

sub section (2).

On the basis of the aforesaid analysis, Section 431 (1) and (2) give a

discretion to the Magistrate to decide with regard to property, the seizure of

which is reported to him.

Initially, the view of the Court was that property be delivered to the

person who had possession of it at the time of seizure.

Punchinona vs. Hinniappuhami 60 N.L.R. 518.

K Piyadasa vs. R.M. Punchi Banda 62 N.L.R. 307.

In these cases it has been laid down that the Magistrate has no power

to deliver Articles taken from the possession of one person to any other

person on the ground that he and not the former possessor is entitled to

posseSSIOn.

However, later, certain modifications of this principle were evolved.

In the case of Sugathapala vs. J.K. Thambirajah 67 N.L.R. 91, it was held,

that while, as a rule, property should be delivered to the person in whose

possession it was at the time of seizure by the Police, it is open to the

Magistrate to order it to be delivered to some other person where there were

special circumstances. This decision has been followed in the cases of W.

Balagalla Vs. Somarathne 70 N.L.R. 382, Thirunayagam Vs. Inspector of

Police, Jaffna 74 N.L.R. 161, Frudenberg Industries Ltd. Vs. Dias

11

Mechanical Engineering Ltd; C.A. Application No. 69/79 C.A. Appeal No.

182/82, Court of Appeal Minutes of 14/07/1983.

A principle had been observed in these cases that the property be

delivered to the person who had possession of it at the time of seizure will

not apply if there is an "unlawful" or "criminal" element in such possession.

In the case at hand, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court

Judge, both referred and have relied on the case of Silva V s. O.I.C.

Thambuttegama (1991) 2 S.L.R. 83. In the said case Sarath Silva J. held

that Section 431 (1) and (2) give a discretion to the Magistrate to decide the

matter with regard to property, the seizure of which is reported to him.

The learned High Court Judge has taken the view that the learned

Magistrate has not correctly and judicially exercised his discretion when he

made the order to release the vehicle to the Appellant of this case. At this

juncture, it is relevant to draw the attention to the written submissions filed

by the Counsel for the Appellant.

It is stated "The simple test for the Magistrate is to decide whether

any party claiming a production before Court has come to possess such

productions through legal means or otherwise. If possession has been

obtained through legal means his possession would not be disturbed.

However, if possession has been obtained through illegal means there is no

fetter in the discretion of the Court to hand over such property to any other

person who in the opinion of the Court would be the person entitled to the

possession of such production".

12

It seems, that the learned High Court Judge having taken into

consideration the above principles has made the impugned order and

therefore, I see no basis to interfere with it.

In D. Jayasuriya Vs. H. Warnakulasooriya 61 N.L.R. 189 - H.N.J

Fernando said, the Section 419 (the same as Section 431 of the Criminal

Procedure Code) cannot be utilised by a "complainant" in order to obtain an

order of possession from the Magistrate of any article seized from the

possession of another as being stolen property, if the other person denies the

theft and claims the property as his own".

In the case at hand, it is an undisputed fact that the vehicle bearing

No. 50 Sri 7295 was taken over by the Police from the Respondent and he is

the registered owner of the vehicle and the absolute owner is Senkadagala

Finance Ltd. at the time the Police seized it. The Respondent has bought the

vehicle in good faith and therefore he is a bonafide purchaser. At the time

he bought the vehicle he did not have any knowledge that a criminal offence

had been committed in respect of the said vehicle. As such he claims the

vehicle as his own.

A Magistrate's Court should not be turned into a forum for the

settlement of civil disputes, yet, a Magistrate making an order under Section

431 must exercise his judicial discretion in ascertaining the person entitled to

possession. The learned High Court Judge has taken the view that the

learned Magistrate had not exercised his discretion judicially and set aside

the order made by the learned Magistrate.

13

Apart from that, it is relevant to note that the learned High Court

Judge has taken into consideration the Section 433 (a) (1) of the Criminal

Procedure Act amended by Act No. 12 of 1990 also when he made the said

Order.

Section 433 (a) (1) reads as follows:

"In the case of a vehicle let under a hire purchase or leasing

agreement, the person registered as the absolute owner of such vehicle under

the Motor Traffic Act (Chapter 203) shall be deemed to be the person

entitled to possession of such vehicle for the purpose of this Chapter"

A closer scrutiny of this section reveals, by the said amendment the

Legislature has intended to protect the rights of the Absolute Owner.

In the instant case, the Senkadagala Finance Company Ltd. as the

absolute owner of the vehicle has issued a letter (P 5) stating that they have

no objection to release the vehicle to the Respondent, as there is a hire

purchase agreement between them and the Respondent.

On perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is

apparent that the learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration the

affidavits and documents filed by both parties in the Magistrate's Court and

has made his Judgment dated 14.11.2014.

As such, I do not see any wrong in the manner in which the learned

High Court has considered the facts and the way in which he has applied the

law in this instance.

14

F or the above stated reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the

Judgment made by the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, I affirm the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 14.11.2014 and dismiss the

Appeal with costs.
