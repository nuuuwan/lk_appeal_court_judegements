DECIDED ON : 25.07.2016

VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PC. J(P / CAl

Heard counsel in support of this application and the learned DSG

representing the 1 st & 2nd respondents.

Petitioners have come before this Court complaining of certain amounts

being charged by the 1 st respondent with regard to facilities provided by

the petitioners to the ships arrived at the Port. The petitioners have

relied on the regulations that they have produced marked P 10 and

submits that according to the schedule to the said regulation there are

amounts which the 1 st respondent can charge from the suppliers when

they are being issued with licences to carry out their duties. However,

he has not submitted before us an advertisement which was published

annually by the 1 st respondent whereby the 1 st respondent had called for

applications from the organizations who are interested in supplying

services for removal of oil waste garbage and sludge from ships arrived at

the Port. The regulation relied upon by the petitioner which was

produced marked P 10 refers to bunkering regulations. We see a

difference between the said regulations and the services supplied by the

petitioner into this petition. As observed by us the relevant provision of

the Act i.e. Marine Pollution Act No. 35 of 2008 by Section 21, 28 the 1 st

t

..

respondent is empowered to outsource duties entrusted to the said

respondent.

As observed by us the said advertisement had been published by the 1 st

respondent under the provisions of Section 21 there is no fees structure

referred to in the act or in regulation which is before this Court. As

submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General the services of the

petitioners supplied are purely contractual and we observe that they

have agreed to provide said services on payment of charges referred to in

the attached fees structure provided to the petitioners when they applied

to register under the said regulation.

As observed by us the said advertisement is suppressed by the petitioner

before this Court.

Under these circumstances, we see no reasons to issue notices in this

application. Therefore, Notices are refused.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

I agree.
