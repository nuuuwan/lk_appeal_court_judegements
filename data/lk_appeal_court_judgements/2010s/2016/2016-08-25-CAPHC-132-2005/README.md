2nd Party -Respondent has purchase this land and had

been in possession of the same.

The Learned Magistrate has also considered the facts

placed before him, by the 1 st party Respondent particularly

the bodies of the his father, father's brother and wife's

were burred in the disputed land.

The Learned Magistrate was also of the VIew the

documents tendered by the 2nd Respondent marked as

2Vl to 2V9 and the testimony of the witnesses In

court for the 2nd Party - Respondent do not fortify the

case of the 2nd Party - Respondent and has been

rejected.

On the other hand the Learned Magistrate was of the

VIew that by the document marked 1 V9, has established

the fact that the 1 st Party- Respondent was In

possessIOn of the subject land. Therefore by the said

order of the Learned Magistrate, the 1 st Party-

determination in the correct perspective, and was inclined

to up hold the impugned order as stated before.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge, the 2nd Party- Petitioner- Appellant has

lodged the instant appeal to this court to have the

said order set aside or vacate.

On the day this case was fIxed for argument the

parties were present but the Respondent was not

represented by a counsel. Nevertheless the court allowed

both parties to fIle written submissions before the date

fIxed for judgment. It IS seen from the record that

only the Appellants had tendered the written

submissions.

It is common ground that pnor to the instant dispute

there had been land disputes between these two

parties, and the said dispute has not been resolved at

the Mediation Board.

When reviewed the impugned order of the Learned High

Court Judge it is abundantly clear that the said order

contained a reVIew of the order of the Learned

Magistrate, and the Learned High Court Judge was

compelled to arnve at the conclusion that the

determination of the Learned Magistrate IS without an

error.

In the said back drop this court see no reason to

interfere with the said order of the Learned High

as stated above.

For the reasons expiated above this court will dismiss

the appeal subject to a costs fIxed at Rs. 5000;'

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.
