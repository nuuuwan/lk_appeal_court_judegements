Before: Vijith K. Malalgoda PC 1 (PICA)

P. Padman Surasena 1

Counsel: Sandamal Rajapaksha for the Petitioner

Vikum de Abrew, DSG for the State

Argued on: 2016-03-01

Decided on: 2016-04-27

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Petitione-r is a company engaged in importing, distributing and selling

agricultural equipment within the country and is the sale agent for

"Sinoha Harvester" which is a branded product imported from the

People's Republic of China and sold within Sri Lanka through its dealer

5

network. This machine is used for the purposes of mass scale harvesting

of paddy.

The Petitioner on being paid Rs. 800,000/- out of the total price of Rs.

2.4 Million released a harvester on or about 2010-09-02 to the 8th

Respondent on the understanding that the 8th Respondent will take

steps to pay the balance of its value which is Rs. 1.6 Million by way of

lease facility obtained through a financial institution.

It is the position of the Petitioner that

I. the 8th Respondent used this harvester during the Maha season of

2010 and Yala season of 2011.

II. the 8th Respondent defaulted payment

III. the Petitioner hence ceased the said harvester from the possession

of the 8th Respondent

IV. statements were recorded by Kurunegala Police from both the

agent of the 8th Respondent and the agent of the Petitioner.

Thereafter as the 8th Respondent had lodged a complaint, the 1st

Respondent has held an inquiry in terms of section 13(1) of the

Consumer Affairs Authority Act. 1st Respondent subsequent to that

inquiry had ordered the Petitioner to pay Rs. 500,000/- out of the total

amount of Rs. 800,000/- he had deposited, back to the 8th Respondent.

This has been done on the basis that the Petitioner had not taken steps

to maintain the said harvester during the period covered by the

warranty given on the harvester by the Petitioner. It is this decision that

is being challenged by the Petitioner in these proceedings.

6

The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that

the complaint of the 8th Respondent is a complaint made after the

specified time period provided for in Section 13(2) of the Act for making

such complaints and hence the 1st Respondent has acted outside the

scope of his power.

However, as pOinted out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the

Petitioner has at no stage during the inquiry denied the existence of a

warranty period for this harvester. Hence, it is the submission of the

learned Deputy Solicitor General that Section 13(2) must be given a

purposive interpretation. He relied on a judgment of this court in David

Peiris Vs. Consumer Affairs Authority C A Application No. 635/ 2007

(Writ) decided on 2009-08-03.

According to Section 13 (2) a complaint under subsection (1) which

relates to the sale of any goods or to the provision of any service shall

be made to the authority in writing within 3 months of the sale of such

goods or the provision of such service, as the case maybe.

If Section 13 (2) is to be interpreted strictly giving a literal meaning to

its words, then that Section will prevent a consumer who has purchased

a good or service with a warranty or guarantee with a longer period

than 3 months, from lodging a complaint relating to such purchase after

3 months of its purchase. In other words such consumer can lodge a

complaint in relation to such goods or services only if something goes

wrong during the first 3 months period of the warranty or guarantee he

has received. This is despite of the fact that he still holds a valid

warranty or guarantee for a longer period than 3 months. The resultant

posltton of such a strict Interpretation would be Inevitably that no

7

consumer would be able to enjoy any warranty or guarantee for a period

exceeding 3 months. It was in this backdrop that this court was called

upon to adjudicate this issue.

It is therefore appropriate at this stage to examine as to what the

legislature intended by promulgation ,of this Act.

When one looks at the preamble of the Act, it becomes clear that this is

an Act to provide for the establishment of the Consumer Affairs

Authority for the promotion of effective competition and the protection

of consumers and for the regulation of internal trade etc. The scope of

an Act and the mischief which is to be remedied through that Act is

generally stated in its preamble and hence, the preamble could be of

some assistance to ascertain what the legislature intended to do by

bringing that Act.

While Section 2 of the Act has established the Consumer Affairs

- -Authority, Section 7 sets out objects of the authority. As per Section 7

objects of the authority shall be:

a. to protect consumers against the marketing of goods or the

provision of services which are hazardous to life and property of

the consumers.

b. to protect consumers against unfair trade practices and guarantee

that consumers' interests shall be given due consideration.

c. to ensure that wherever possible, consumers have adequate

access to goods and services at competitive prices. And,

d. to seek redress against unfair trade practices, restrictive trade

practices or any other forms of exploitation of consumers by

traders.

Section 13 which is a section in part II of the Act which deals with the

regulation of trade, has conferred power on the authority to inquire into

complaints regarding the manufacture or sale of any goods which do not

conform t() _ the warranty or guarantee given by implication or otherwise

by the manufacturer or trader.

A closer examination of the above provisions amply demonstrate that

the legislature by promulgation of this Act intended to protect the

consumers in their day to day engagements in purchases and to provide

redresses if and when any such injustice occur. Thus, as has been

shown before, literal interpretation of Section 13 (2) would only enable a

trader to breach with absolute impunity, a warranty or guarantee that

he provides on his own volition, to the consumers. It cannot be said with

any yardstick that it has been the intention which the legislature

entertained when it passed this Act.

This court-in David Peiris Motor Company Ltd Vs. Consumer Affairs

Authority, (Supra) having analyzed these provisions has held that

Section 13 (2) must be given a purposive interpretation. This court in

that case has held as follows:

" ... Section 13 (2), must be given a purposive interpretation. If a

warranty of goods covers for a period of two years and the purchaser

can only complain within 3 months of the purchase of the goods in

relation to the breach of a warranty or guarantee; it will lead to

absurdity and the protection given by Section (1) (b) would be rendered

9

nugatory. Section 13 (2) has imposed a 3 months limitation for

complains only in relation to the sale of any goods or to the provision of

any service which does not conform to the standards and specifications

determined under Section 12 ... "

Thus, it is clear that this has been the consistent thinking of this court.

For the foregoing reasons the argument advanced by the learned

counsel for the Petitioner that the Consumer Affairs Authority does not

have power to entertain the instant complaint, must necessarily fail.

Hence, this application is refused. It should stand dismissed. We make

no order for costs.
