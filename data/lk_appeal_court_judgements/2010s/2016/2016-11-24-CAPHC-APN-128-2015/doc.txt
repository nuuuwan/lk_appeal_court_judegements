Petitioner being aggrieved by the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate

invoked the Appellate Jurisdiction of the High Court of Western Province. Learned

High Court Judge imposed following sentences;

I. 1st count 8 months rigorous imprisonment and suspended for 10 years. A

fine of Rs. 1,41,0001= in default of 1 year imprisonment.

Compensation of Rs. 800,0001= payable to Aitken Spence company in

Compensation of Rs. 800,0001= payable to Aitken Spence company in

default 2 years imprisonment.

111. 3 rd count 8 months rigorous imprisonment and suspended for 10 years.

A fine of Rs. 10001= in default of 1 month imprisonment

Compensation of Rs. 800,0001= payable to Aitken Spence company in

default 2 years imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned High Court Judge the Accused

Petitioner appealed to this Court stating that the learned High court Judge has

failed to consider the fact that the there is no provision in the Debt Recovery Act

No 2 of 1990 as amended by Act No 04 of 1994, to impose a compensation on a

convict but learned High Court Judge has erroneously imposed a compensation

and a default sentence which is contrary to the established Law. At the argument

he contended that the Appellant has already spent more than 3 years in the prison

and he has completed the original sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate. The

Counsel moved to set aside the judgment of the High Court and to implement the

original sentence passed by the learned Magistrate.

The learned SSC argued that this being an economic crime, Court has to be

4

mindful about the effect on the country's economy and the Appellant's attitude of

selecting the sentence favourable to him. The Counsel argued that the Court can

impose compensation in a fit case using the inherent power of the Court.

It is not in dispute that the section 25 of the Debt Recovery Special Provisions Act

No.2 of 1990 there is no provision to include an order to pay the compensation.

The section reads;

25. (1) Any person who"

(a) draws, a cheque knowing that there are no fimds or not sufficient

fimds in the bank to honour such cheque; or

(b) makes an order to a banker to pay a sum of money which payment

is not made by reason of there being no obligation on such banker

to make payment or by reason of the payment having been

countennanded;or

(c) gives an authority to an institution to pay a sum of money to itself, in

payment of a debt or loan or any part thereof owed to such

institution, from, and out of an account maintained or fimds

deposited, by such person with such institution and such institution

is unable to make such payment to itself by reason of such person

not placing adequate fi.mds in such account or by reason of the

fimds deposited having been withdrawn by reason of such person

countermanding the authority given or by reason of anyone or

more of such reasons; or

(d) having accepted on inland bill dishonours it by non - payment, shall

be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on conviction by a

Magistrate after summary trial be liable to punishment with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to

one year or with fine of ten thousand rupees or ten per centum of

the full value of the cheque, order, authority or inland bill in respect

of which the offonce is committed, whichever is higher, or with both

such fine and imprisonment,

The provisions of the Debt Recovery Act does not provide for the payment of

compensation. It has created a criminal offence punishable with a jail tenn and

a fine. The maximum jail tenn is one year and the maximum fine is Rs.

10,000.00 or 10% of the value whichever is higher. Payment of compensation

to the victim of the crime did not include in to the section. As the learned SSC

submitted, these are economic crimes and the commercial issues of the parties

were left to the Civil Court by the legislature and the criminal offence was

created to prevent using bills or cheque without adequate fimds.

The Criminal Procedure Code provided a mechanism to pay compensation to

the victims of a crime. Section 17 (4) of the Code provides that;

(4) Whenever any person is convicted of any offonce or where the court

holds the charge to be proved but proceeds to deal with the offender

without convicting him, the court may order the person convicted or

against whom the court holds the charge to be proved to pay within

such time or in such installments as the court may direct, Such sum by

way of compensation to any person qffocted by the offonce as to the

court shall seem fit.

This is also not without a limit. The Legislature has limited the amount that can

5

be ordered by a Magistrate to Rs. 100000.00. The sub section (7) of the Code

reads;

(7) When the compensation ordered is by a Magistrate's Court, such

compensation shall not exceed one hundred thousand rupees to each

aggrieved party, notwithstanding that such amowzt is in excess of the

amount a Magistrate may normally impose as fine.

Earlier the amount was limited to Rs. 500.00 but in 2005 by Act No. 14 it was

increased to the present amount Ordering a convict to pay compensation with a

default sentence in addition to the sentence prescribed under the law for the

offence, is an order affecting his personaIliberty. Therefore the Judge has to be

mindful of all the circumstances such as the nature of the offence, the

punishment imposed, the ability to pay, the availability of a civil action and the

capacity of the complainant to go for a civil action when ordering the convict to

pay the compensation. The compensation should not be ordered as a speedy

way of recovering the damage sustained by the complainant

In the present case the total amount involved is Rs. 2,410,000.00. The learned

High Court Judge ordered the Appellant to pay Rs. 800,000.00 for each count

totaling Rs. 2,400,000.00 as compensation to the complainant, making this

action an easy and speedy way of collecting the total amount of money

involved in this action with the condition that if the money is not paid the

Appellant will be incarcerated on Government expense.

The learned High Court Judge was sitting in appeal on judgment of a

Magistrate Court. What an Appellate Court can do in an appeal is defined in the

Criminal Procedure Code. Under proviso to the section 328 of the Code the

6

Court sitting in appeal cannot exceed maximum punishment that would have

given by the original Court. The section reads;

328. At the hearing of the appeal the court may if it considers that there

is no sufficient ground for interfering dismiss the appeal or may -

( a) in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse such order and

direct that further inquiry be made or that the accused be re-tried

or committed for trial as the case may be or find him guilty and

pass sentence on him according to law;

(b) in an appeal from a conviction -

(i) reverse the verdict and sentence and acquit or

discharge the accused or order him to be re tried by a

court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial, or

(ii) alter the verdict maintaining the sentence, or with or

without altering the verdict increase or reduce the amount

of the sentence or the nature thereof;

(c) in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse such order;

Provided always that the sentence awarded on an appeal shall not

exceed the sentence which might have been awarded by the court of first

instance. (Emphasis added)

The original Court was the Magistrate Court where the Appellant was

convicted and sentenced. The learned High Court Judge was sitting in appeal.

Therefore the High Court cannot exceed the maximum compensation that

7

might have been awarded. Under section 17 (7) of the Criminal Procedure

Code the maximum compensation that can be awarded is Rs. 100000.00. The

learned High Court Judge cannot exceed that amount in appeal.

The maximum jail term that can be imposed under section 25 of the Debt

Recovery Act is one year. The 1 st and 2nd charges were framed against the

Appellant under this section. The learned High Court Judge ordered to pay Rs.

800,000.00 on each count as compensation with a default term of two years

imprisonment. Is it reasonable to impose a default sentence exceeding the

maximum jail term for nonpayment of compensation? My view is that it is not

reasonable.

The Criminal Procedure Code provides for imposing a term of imprisonment in

default of payment of fmes. The section 291 of the Code provides that;

291. (1) Where any fine is imposed under the authority of any law for

the time being in force, then in the absence of any express provision

relating to such fine in such law contained the provisions following shall

apply, that is to say: -

(a) ..... .

(b) in every case of an offence punishable with imprisonment as

well as fme in which the offender is sentenced to a fine, whether

with or without imprisonment, and in every caSe of an offence

punishable with fme only in which the offender is sentenced to a

fine, the court passing the sentence may in its discretion direct by

the sentence that in default of payment of the fine the offender

shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, which imprisonment

8

i f f f II

I I

shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may

have been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a

commutation of a sentence;

(c) ...... .

(d) the term for which the court directs the offender to be

imprisoned in defou/t of payment of a fine shall not exceed one-

fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed

for the offence if the offence be punishable with imprisonment as

well as fine ; (Emphasis added)

In the present case the maximum term of imprisonment fixed for the 1 st and 2nd

counts is one year. Under these circumstances ordering a default term of two

years imprisonment for nonpayment of compensation cannot be justified in any

way.

Under these circumstances; we set aside the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge. We order to implement the sentence passed by the learned

Magistrate.
