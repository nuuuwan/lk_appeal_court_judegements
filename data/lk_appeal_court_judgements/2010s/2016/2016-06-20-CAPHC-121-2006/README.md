P.R.Walgama, J

The Defendant-Petitioner -Appellant (in short the Appellant)

Lo' ," '",: preferred the instant appeal, and impugned the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 11.05.2006, made in the case

bearing No. HCR- 38/99, in the High Court of Province, holden

at Ratnapura.

The facts unspooled in the petition of appeal surfaced'thus;

.' ." .~.

The Applicant- Respondent instituted action against the Appellant

in the Magistrate Court of Ratnapura in terms of Section 5 of

the State lands Recovery of Possession Act to recover the land

in issue from the Appellant and moved for an order, ejecting

the Appellant from the said land.

In pursuant to the launching of the said application the Learned

Magistrate, made order dated 13.08.1998, ejecting the Appellant

from the suit land.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned Magistrate, the

Appellant made an application in revision to the High Court of

Ratnapura, to have the said impugned order set aside -vacate.

It was the primary bone of contention of the Appellant that

the person who instituted action in the Magistrate '-C'~~rt was

not the Competent Authority, as he was the Deputy Director of

the Management Supervision Division of the Ministry of

Plantation Industries. The Section 18 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act has

Authority" as thus;

defined the "Comnetent

.;~~, .. r.;: :,""""'-

II In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires "competent

authority" used in relation to any land means the Government

Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant

Government Agent of the district in which the land is situated

and, includes," the categories which was recognised by the

amendment to the above Act in 1993 by Act No. 60 of 1993.

In refusing the application of the Petitioner- Appellant, the

Learned High Court Judge had observed that in the 'Magistrate

4

Court, although he had taken objections but had failed

established why the order for ejectment should not be issued.

Therefore it is contended by the Respondent that the Appellant

had never raised the above objection and further more the

Appellant was not in a position to establish that he had permit

or a valid legal document to prove his title to the subject

land. Besides the Learned High Court Judge was of the view

that the Appellant has not adduced exceptional circumstances,

which warrants, the High Court to exercise

jurisdiction, to resolve the matter in issue.

the revisionary

In opposing the above contention of the Appellant, die""c'ounsel

for the Respondent, categorically asserts that the Appellant had

never taken up the issue that the quit notice had been issued

by a person who does not come under the category of

'authorised person', and therefore he cannot raised any objection

~ ...... ',' as to the afore said issue in the appeal. In addition to the

afore said it is also reiterated by the counsel that the quit

notice was filed by the government officer specifically

authorised by the body corporate to do so, and it is stated

that the subject matter is the Janatha Estate Oevelopment Board

and not Hapugastena Estate Ltd.

It is intensely relevant to note that the suit land is a State

land and the Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to make

any order regarding a State Land, as such right is vested with

the Centre, as per Judicial pronouncement in the case of

Solimuttu Rasu, and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.

, ~ .... ,. .

Hence in the said back drop this Court is of the view that the

Appellant's application to this Court is devoid of merits and

should stand dismissed.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed subject to a cost of Rs. 5000/

Appeal is dismissed.
