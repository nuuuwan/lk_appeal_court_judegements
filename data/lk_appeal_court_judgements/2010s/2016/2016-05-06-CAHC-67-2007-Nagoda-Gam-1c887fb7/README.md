Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The accused-appellant Nagoda Gamage Ratnasiri was indicted before the High Court of Galle for

having committed the murder of Ediriweera Dayarathana on or about 11.04.1995 an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

The accused-appellant elected to be tried before the High Court Judge without a jury and the trial was

commenced in the said High Court of Galle on 03.08.2004. After trial the Learned High Court Judge

of Galle had convicted the accused-appellant of the indictment and sentenced him to death. Being

dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence the accused-appellant had preferred this appeal

before this court.

The prosecution in the case in hand had mainly relied on the evidence of two witnesses who had

testified at the N.S. inquiry, who were deceased at the trial, when it was taken up for trial in the year

2004, 09 years after the commission of the offence. Their evidence was properly adopted before the

High Court Trial since the High Court Judge was satisfied that the requirements under section 33 of

the Evidence Ordinance were fulfilled.

The Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant did not challenge the said decision of the Learned

High Court Judge before this court.

Out of the said witnesses, witness Kandagoda Gamage Nandasena was an eye witness to the incident

and the other witness Adawatte Kankanamage Ranjith had witnessed a previous incident which took

place little prior to the main incident between him and the accused-appellant.

In addition to the above witnesses few other witnesses including the Judicial Medical Officer Gamini

Senevirathne, Inspector Cyril Rodrigo and Anawatte Kanakanamge Nihal - brother -in-law of the

deceased was called as prosecution witnesses at the High Court Trial.

Since the two important witnesses referred to above are deceased at the time of the trial, it is important

to consider the evidence of the remaining witness who gave evidence at the Trial, and the other

independent material placed before the trial court and considers the extent to which the said material

corroborates the version of the other witnesses.

According to the evidence of Anawatte Kanakanamge Nihal, on the day of the incident around 11.00

pm when he was at home, witness Nandasena had called him to his house. When he went to

Nandasena's house he had seen his brother Ranjith with a bleeding injury on his arm. They took him

to a nearby dispensary for medical treatment, thinking that they would take Ranjith to a hospital on the

following day. Mter taking treatment to Ranjith witness Nihal had gone home.

Around 2.30 in the morning, he came out from his house after hearing a noise. At that time he

observed two people running towards him. They were identified as the deceased and the accused-

appellant. When the deceased had fallen near the lamp post, accused-appellant went away saying "O)C)

@Gdi@.5)r;.;) a@@C)di.5) tg)cJc)@C)~) O~C)". At that time he had seen a knife with the accused-

appellant. Even though this witness had seen the accused-appellant running behind the deceased and

deceased falling down, he had not seen the accused-appellant doing anything to the deceased, but he

saw the accused-appellant with a knife and heard saying that he will kill two others before dawn.

According to the deposition of witness Nandasena which was produced at the High Court Trial, he

was suffering from a demonic possessions and that there was a thovil ceremony conducted at his place

day prior to the incident. Some people who could not come to attend the said event had come to his

house on the following day, and when he was playing cards with some of them, around 12.00 the

accused-appellant who came to his place had given few blows to one Ranjith who had been at

Nandasena's house and went away having stabbing him in his arm.

Mter hearing the said incident several others gathered at his place, including the deceased Dayarathne.

Some attended to the injured and taken him for treatment. The second incident took place sometime

after, when the accused-appellant came to his place again armed with a knife and stabbed the

deceased. The deceased having received the said injury had ran towards the lamp post and held on to

the lamp post. I

Witness Ranjith whose deposition was also produced at the High Court Trial had said at the N.S.

inquiry that he had gone to the house of Nandasena having taken some sugar since he could not attend

the thovil ceremony on the previous day. While he was in conversation with Nandasena the accused-

appellant who has come to the house of Nandasena had delt three blows on him and thereafter stabbed

him on his arm and went away threatening him not to go to the hospital or to the police.

During the argument before this court the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant relied her case on

the following grounds;

a) Very vital omissions and the material contradiction on critical issues of fact in the evidence

of prosecution witness no 3 Nihal renders his evidence unworthy of credence

b) Learned trial Judge seriously flawed with regard to the assessment of the testimonial

trustworthiness of the said witness Nihal

c) In the event the evidence of witness Nihal is rejected, the conviction which is solely based

on the deposition of witness Nandasena is wholly unsafe

e) The basis of the conviction being that the deposition of witness Nandasena is amply

corroborated by the evidence of witness Nihal is legally and factually untenable

During the argument, the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant brought to the notice of court of

03 items of evidence from the evidence of witness Nihal where, the witness had failed to refer in his

statement to police or evidence at the inquest.

The said three items had been identified by the Learned Counsel as follows;

1. Not mentioned that he saw the accused-appellant running towards him

2. Not mentioned that the accused was armed with a knife

3. Not mentioned in the police statement that the appellant made an utterance to the effect that

"before dawn he will kill 2 more persons"

As observed by this court, the lSI and the 2nd omissions were marked in the evidence of the 3rd witness

from his statement to police and evidence before the inquirer but no omission was marked with regard

to his evidence before the Magistrate. The third omission was only with regard to the police statement

of the said witness but no such omission was proved with regard to his evidence at the inquest or the

Non- Summary Inquiry.

When considering the importance of the above omissions, it is necessary for this court to consider the

deposition made by the sole eye witness Nandasena at the N.S. inquiry and to consider whether,

witness Nihal had changed his original version in order to corroborate the said evidence or not.

As referred to above, witness Nandasena's evidence before the Non Summary Inquiry was that, after

Ranjith received a stab inquiry, he was taken to a doctor. Deceased Dayarathne who had come to his

house after hearing the lSI stabbing was seated on a half wall when the accused-appellant came for the

2nd time to his house and stabbed Dayarathne. After receiving the injury the deceased ran up to a lamp

post and hold on to the lamp post.

In this evidence witness Nandasena speaks of, the accused-appellant coming to his house twice with a

knife but did not speak of making any statement or running behind the deceased. The fact that the

deceased had gone and hold on to the lamp post is corroborated by the evidence of the investigating

officer IP Rodrigo.

The fact that the accused-appellant had come to the house of Nandasena on a previous occasion on the

same day and stabbed Ranjith was corroborated by the deposition of witness Ranjith made at the Non

Summary Inquiry.

Witness Nihal whose evidence was highly challenged before us, was not an eye witness to the stabbing

on the deceased Dayarathna and therefore his evidence cannot be considered as evidence which

corroborates the evidence of witness Nandasena with regard to stabbing of the deceased.

When considering the omissions referred to above, in the light of the said evidence of witness

Nandasena, I see no reason to reject the conclusion of the Learned High Court Judge when he

concluded that the omissions referred to above does not go to the root of the prosecution case.

The Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had further argued that, if the evidence given by Nihal

is rejected, the conviction which is solely based on the deposition of witness Nanadasena is wholly

unsafe.

As I have referred earlier in this judgment, the accused-appellant had never challenged the adoption of

the evidence of witnesses Nandasena and Ranjith under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

When acting on the said deposition this court is always mindful of the fact that admissibility of

evidence under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance as an exception to the general rule.

However it is observed by us that the Learned High Court Judge was mindful of this fact, but as

argued by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant, the Trial Judge had relied heavily on the

evidence of witness Nihal as corroborative evidence to the deposition of witness Nanadasena.

As observed by me earlier, in this judgment, witness Nihal cannot be considered as an eye witness to

the main incident of stabbing. The only person who witnessed the main incident of stabbing was

witness Nandasena who was dead at the time of the High Court Trial. As discussed earlier in this

judgment, the deposition of witness Nandasena was not only corroborated by the evidence of witness

Nihal but also corroborated by the deposition of Ranjith and independent material such as Medical

Evidence and Police Observation.

In this regard the court is mindful of the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of

Mannar Mannan V. The Republic 1990 (1) Sri LR 280, to the effect;

"Despite the non direction in regard to the appellant's dock statement a reasonable jury

properly directed would inevitably and without doubt have returned the same verdict."

As observed by me earlier in this judgment, even though the Learned Trial Judge had heavily relied on

the evidence of witness Nihal which amounts to a misdirection, the said misdirection alone is

insufficient to vitiate the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge.

During the argument before us the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had further challenged

the credibility of the deposition made by witness Nandasena and argued that it is unsafe to act upon

the evidence of witness Nandasena even if it was corroborated by other material. In the dock statement

made by the accused-appellant he had taken up for the first time, that witness Nandasena was a person

with unsound mind and therefore he had to undergo a "thovil" to recover himself.

However at the time witness Nandasena made the deposition before the Magistrate, the accused-

appellant was represented by counsel and the said witness was subject to cross examination by the said

counsel, but this position was not put to the witness during the cross examination. The Learned Trial

Judge had correctly considered this aspect and rejected the said argument. When considering the

material already discussed, we see no merit in the arguments placed before us by the Learned Counsel

for the accused-appellant. Therefore we decide to dismiss this appeal and to affirm the conviction and

sentence.

Appeal dismissed. Conviction and sentence affirmed.
