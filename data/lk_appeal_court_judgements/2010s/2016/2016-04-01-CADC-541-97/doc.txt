P.R.Walgama, J

This appeal assails the Judgment dateu 23 uf Ivlay

pronounced by the Learned District Judge In favour of

the Plaintiff - Respondent.

The Plaintiff - Respondent instituted action against the

Defendant - Appellant and claimed the reliefs inter alia;

a. For a declaration that he IS entitled to the field

more fully described In the schedule to the plaint as

2

the Trustee and Viharadhipathy of the Passara

Rajamaha viharaya,

b. For an order ejecting the Defendant and all others

claiming under him, and to placed the Plaintiff in

possession of the disputed land,

c. For an order against the Defendants to deliver to the

Plaintiff 17 Bushals of paddy or to pay its equivalent

value amounting to Rs. 561 as damages.

The facts emerged from the plaint of the PI ain tiff-

Respondent are crystallized as follows;

The subject land belong to the Pas sara Rajamahaviharaya

was gifted by one Mauassagolla Sumana Thero to the

then Viharadipathi Botota Medankara Thero.

Sequent to the demise of said Botota Medankara

Thero the disputed land devolved on his pupil Rev.

Sapuroda Sobitha, who also died and was

succeeded by Rev. Parapawe Sri Sumana Thero and

after his demise the Plaintiff succeeded to the

Vaharadhipathy ship.

Pursuant to the above succeSSIOn the Plaintiff was duly

appointed Trustee of the temple above by the Public

Trustee in accordance with the provision of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance.

It is asserted by the Plaintiff that the above temple was

the lawful owner of the land described in the schedule

3

here to and had been In possesslOn for 'vel! over 60

years of the said land.

It IS alleged by the Plaintiff that the Defendant took

forcible possession of the said paddy field on or about

11.01.1974 and was working

August 1974, and thereafter

the said paddy field

SInce 1975 the plaintiff

till

was

In possesslOn through his tenant cultivator, who had

worked as the tenant cultivator of the plaintiff of the

said land.

Thereafter

the said

once agaIn

paddy field

the Defendant had forcibly

and started working the

field. Therefore In the above setting i.he

for the said relief from the District Court.

As a comprehensive response to the above claim the

Defendant - Respondents, by their Answer has stated the

following;

That the land more fully described In the schedule to

the Answer is a land known as 'MADDEPITA KIMBURA'

con taining In exten t

depicted In Plan No.

2 Roods and 20.7 Perches, and

112 dated 09.09.1979 made by

Premachandra Licensed Surveyor.

The original owner of the said land was G.G.H. Pinhamy

and after his demise his daughter G.G.H. Punchi Nona

became entitled to the disputed land.

4

The said Punchi Nona was the second Defendant In the

original court and after her death

substituted accordingly.

Further it IS stated that the land claimed by the

Plain tiff IS to the West of the land possessed by the

Defendants.

The threshold Issue to be resolved In the instant appeal

is the identification of the land in dispute.

The land that IS claimed by the Plaintiff IS known

as KURUMINI KOTE KUMBURA also known as

KURUMINI KOTE YATITURE KUMBURA containing in extent

two pelas of paddy sowing. (approximately 2 and half

acres)

But the land in which the Defendants possess in known

as MADDEPITAKUMBURA containing In extent 2 roods

and 20 perches depicted In plan No. 112 dated

09.09.1979 made by Premachandra licensed surveyor.

The Learned District Judge has also considered the

evidence adduced by one Nandawathi who worked as the

Tenant Cultivator In the land In dispute, under the

Plaintiff.

It was the position of said Nandawathi that she

was the tenant cultivator of the Plaintiff and the 1 s~

Defendant forcibly entered the disputed paddy field

In 1974 and started working in the paddy field.

As a result there was a complaint made to the

5

Deputy Commissioner

After the

of

by

Agrarian

the Deputy

Services of Haliella.

Commissioner of Inquuy

Services by his order marked 0'7 .... I

the said Nandawathi In possessIOn of the disputed

paddy field.

The Learned District has also dealt with the plan No.

112 tendered and marked as PI which was prepared by

the surveyor on a commISSIon issued by Court. The plan

that was prepared according to the said commISSIOn was

never challenged by the Defendant - Appellants.

Further the Learned District Judge was of the VIew that

the Defendants were not agreeable to accept the said

plan they should have got another commISSIOn and

established the fact that the disputed land is the land

that they are entitled to and not the land that the

Plain tiff is claiming.

Therefore in the above setting the Learned District

has arrived at the conclusion that the paddy field In

dispute IS the paddy field that IS been claimed by

the Plaintiff.

When reviewed the impugned judgment In its totality

this Court IS of the VIew that the Learned District

Judge has arrived at the above determination In the

correct perspective, and as such warrants to affirm the

same.

6

Thus I hold that the appeal IS devoid of merits and

should stand dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed, subject to a cost of Rs. 5000/-
