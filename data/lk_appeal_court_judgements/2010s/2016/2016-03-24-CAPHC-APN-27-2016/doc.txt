This is an application for revision from an order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo. The 6th Accused Petitioner's (hereinafter some time called

and referred to as the Petitioner) application to release on bail has been denied

by the Learned High Court Judge. Being aggrieved by the said order, the

Petitioner presented this application to revise the said order.

The Petitioner says that she was a non executive director of Golden Key Credit

Card Company Limited (hereinafter some time called and referred to as the

I I I I I I

2

company) and was not involved in the day to day business of the company. She

further says that she resigned from the director post on 31 st October 2008. On

31 st December 2008 she had left the country for medical treatment to Singapore

and after three months went to UK. She submitted several medical certificates to

show that she was under medical treatment while in UK. The Petitioner says

that she being an elderly lady of 74 years, has decided to spend her last years in

Sri Lanka, came back to the Island against the medical advice, knowingly that

she will be apprehended at the arrival. She had been taken to custody at the

airport by the emigration officers and was handed over to the police. On the

request of the cardiologist who accompanied her to Sri Lanka, she was admitted

to the Durdans Hospital and was remanded to the prison custody. Later she was

transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka and from there to the prison

hospital.

The petitioner applied for bail from the High Court and the State objected to.

After inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge refused bail on two grounds i.e.

she was absconding for a long time and that she is a share holder and her

husband is the major share holder of the company. Being aggrieved by the said

order, the Petitioner moved in revision.

The Complainant Respondent (the Hon. Attorney General) (hereinafter some

time called and referred to as the Respondent) objected to the application on

several grounds. Firstly a preliminary objection was raised on the ground that

there is no exceptional circumstances to invoke the discretionary remedy of

revisionary jurisdiction and an alternative remedy - right to appeal - is available.

State further objected to this application under section 14 of the Bail Act No. 30

of 1997 that the Petitioner is capable of absconding from trial and there could be

a public disquiet if the Petitioner is released on bail because the amount of

money involved in this case is of very high magnitude.

At the inquiry, the Learned PC for the Petitioner submitted that the age and the

medical condition of the Petitioner itself can be considered as exceptional

circumstances. He further argued that the order of the Learned High Court

Judge is not in accordance with the section 14 of the Bail Act. The Learned

ASG argued that the alternative remedy of appeal is available as of a right and

in such situations the discretionary remedy of revision is not available. His

contention is that there are no exceptional circumstances to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction.

The Petitioner is a lady of 74 years of age. The Respondent submits that the

authenticity of the medical reports issued by the doctors in UK cannot be

verified and therefore it cannot be relied upon. But the medical report issued by

the JMO Colombo is an authentic document. That report was submitted to Court

on the order of the Learned Magistrate. The JMO was of the onion that she

should be kept under ICU care for 48 hours and then to transfer to another

hospital only if there is no objection medically by the doctors treating her. This

report suggests that the Petitioner was in need of intensive care when she was

remanded and when she is out of danger, her health condition has to be

managed properly. Even if the medical reports issued by the doctors in UK are

not accepted as suggested by the Learned ASG, still there is evidence to show

that the Petitioner is sick elderly woman who needs medical attention.

There is a long line of authorities that a revision is discretionary remedy and to

invoke such jurisdiction it is necessary to establish exceptional circumstances.

Further, if there is an alternative remedy, the revisionary jurisdiction is not

available. The Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner does not challenge

this position. His argument is that even if there is an alternative remedy is

available, ifthere are exceptional circumstances, the revision is also available.

(1978-79) 2 Sri LR 225 Sumanathangam v Meeramohideen 60 NLR 394 it has

been held that the Court of Appeal has the power to act in revision, even though

the procedure by way of appeal is available, in appropriate cases and an appeal

from the judgment with the present backlog of cases in the appellate Court

would be considerably delayed.

BUDDHADASA KALUARACHCHI v. NILAMANI WIJEWICKRAMA

AND ANOTHER. [J990]1Sri L R 262 at 267

Section 139 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka states as follows:

" The Court of Appeal may in the exercise of its jurisdiction affirm,

reverse, correct or modify any order, judgment, decree or sentence

according to law, or it may give directions to such court of first instance,

tribunal or other institutions or order a new trial or further hearing upon

such terms as the court of appeal shall think fit.

(2) The Court of Appeal may further receive and admit new evidence

additional to or supplementary of, the evidence already taken in the court

of first instance touching the matters at issue in any original case, suit,

prosecution or action as the justice of the case may require. "

The section empowers the appellate court with wide powers.

Similar powers are envisaged in section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code.

But the appellate court will be guided by the provisions of section 758 (e)

& (f). The appellate court would in law have to consider the demand or

the form of relief claimed If there is no relief claimed to set aside the

judgment and decree for the dissolution of marriage by either party, I am

of the view that the appellate court would not grant a relief which no

5

party had prayed for. However wide the jurisdiction of the court of

appeal may be it can only exercise it in a properly constituted appeal

from judgment presented to it by an aggrieved party.

It was submitted by the Learned Counsel for the first defendant

respondent that there are no exceptional circumstances for the petitioner

to come by way of revision, as the plaintiff-petitioner had appealed from

the order of the Trial Judge dated 25.5.89. This is an action for divorce

filed as far back as on 27.8.82 and it had taken nearly 7 years for the

District Court to conclude the trial. An appeal from the judgment dated

25.5.89 with the present backlog of cases in the appellate court would be

considerably delayed, even if application is made to accelerate the

appeal, for final determination in my view would be considerably

prolonged. In the circumstances I am of the view, this is an apt case to

exercise the revisionary powers of the court. It was held in Atukorale v.

Samyanathan (3): "The powers given to the Supreme Court by way of

revision are wide enough to give it the right to revise any order made by

an original court whether an appeal has been taken against it or not".

The trend of recent decisions is that the Court of Appeal has the power to

act in revision even though the procedure by way of appeal is available in

appropriate cases. In Rustom v. Hapangama & Co. (4) it was held that

the powers by way of revision conferred on the appellate court are very

wide and can be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against an

order of the original court or not. However such powers would be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances where an appeal lay and as

to what such exeptionable circumstances are, is dependant on the facts of

each case.

Vythialingam, J. stated in Rustom v. Hapangama & Co. (supra) "where

an order is palpably wrong and affects the rights of a party also, this

6

court would exercise its powers of revision to set aside the wrong

irrespective of whether an appeal was taken or was available. "

In Sinnathangam v. Meeramohideen (5) T. S. Fernando, J. said "We do

not entertain any doubt that this court possesses the power to set aside an

erroneous decision of the District Court in an appropriate case even

though an appeal against such decision has been correctly held to have

abated. It only remains for us to examine whether there is a substantial

question of law involved here and whether this is an appropriate case for

us to exercise the powers of revision vested in this court".

I am of the view that this is an appropriate case for us to exercise the

powers of revision considering the time already taken in the District

Court to enter a decree of dissolution of the marriage.

I am in respectful and full agreement with the view expressed. It must

take some time for the appeal to be heard. In this circumstance I am of

the view that the court should exercise its revisionary powers.

In the present case also the Petitioner has the right to appeal but the appeal will

take a considerable time to conclude and the Petitioner will have to be in

remand custody until such time. The Petitioner's health condition is considered

with the time consumption of an appeal, my view is that it constitutes

exceptional circumstances.

The petitioner is indicted in the High Court of Colombo on several counts. The

first count is that she has committed an offence punishable under section 38(1)

read with 36(1) of the Finance Companies Act, No. 78 of 1988 as amended by

the Finance Companies (Amendment) Act. No 23 of 1991. The other charges

are aiding and abetting to commit offences punishable under section 391 and

386 of the Penal Code. The Petitioner admits that she was a director of the

company, but she says that she has resigned from the post of director on Ir I

7

31.10.2008. The charges are for the period from 23.03.1999 to 24.12.2008

during which the Petitioner was a director of the company. Therefore, her

resignation has no direct bearing. What the Court has to decide in this

application is whether the Petitioner can be released on bailor is it necessary to

keep her under remand custody until the case is concluded.

Releasing a suspect or an accused on bail is governed by the Bail Act of No.30

of 1997. Prior to the enactment of the Act, the rule of releasing on bail was

twofold. Under section 402 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the rule in relation

to the bailable offences, is to release on bail and the exception is to remand.

402. When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable

offence appears or is brought before a court and is prepared at any time

at any stage of the' proceedings before such court to give bail such

person shall be released on bail:

It has been held in the case of Pathirana and another v. OJ.C. Nittambuwa

Police [1988] 1 Sri L R 84 that the accused is entitled as of right to be released

on bail at any stage of the proceedings. An order of remand in such

circumstances is an illegal order.

Section 403 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the Court can grant

bail on its discretion.

403. (1) A Magistrate or a Judge of the High Court, at any stage of any

inquiry or trial, as the case may be, may in his discretion release on bail

any person accused of any non-bailable offence:

The rule in such cases is to remand and the bail is the exception. In such cases

the accused had to establish exceptional grounds to obtain bail,

THE QUEENv. D. J F. D. LIYANAGE and others 65 NLR 289 at 292

Much stress was laid in the arguments of Counsel for the defendants on

the presumption of innocence and the liberty which an individual is

8

entitled to. This Court will never cease to safeguard the liberty of the

subject. "The favour shown to freedom" will always influence Judges who

approach questions affecting that liberty. But it is not to be thought that

the grant of bail should be the rule and the refusal of bail should be the

exception where serious non-bailable offences of this sort are concerned;

bail is in such cases granted only in rare instances and for strong and

special reasons, as for instance where the prosecution case is prima facie

weak:

This rule was changed by the Legislature with the enactment of the Bail Act

No.30 of 1997. Admitting to bail was made the rule and the refusal was made

the exception. Section 2 of the Bail Act reads thus;

Subject to the exceptions as hereinafter provided for in this Act, the

guiding principle in the implementation of the provisions of this Act shall

be, that the grant of bail shall be regarded as the rule and the refusal to

grant bail as the exception.

Under section 4 of the Act, a person suspected or accused of being concerned in

committing, or having committed a bailable offence was made entitle to bail

subject to the provisions of the Act. Section 5 provided that a person suspected

or accused of being concerned in committing, or having committed a non-

bailable offence may at any time be released on bail at the discretion of the

court. By section 7, the Court was empowered to release on bail any person

suspected or accused of, being concerned in committing or having committed, a

non- bailable or bailable offence that appears, is brought before, or surrenders,

to the court having jurisdiction. Therefore it is very clear that the intention of

the Legislature is to change the rule relating to bail.

i. The Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997 which came into operation on 28th

November, 1997 is the applicable law.

ii. By the enactment of the Bail Act the policy in granting bail has

undergone a major change. The rule is the grant of bail. The Rule

upholds the values endorsed in human freedom. The exception is the

refusal of bail and reasons should be given when refusing bail.

Per SRlSKANDRAJAH, J.

"By the enactment of the Bail Act there is a major change in the

legislative policy and the Courts are bound to give effect to this policy.

The High Court judge in the impugned Order has erred in not taking into

consideration the policy change that has been brought in by the

enactment and mechanically applied the principle that the accused have

failed to show exceptional circumstances when this requirement is no

more a principle governing bail pending appeal"

Section 14 of the Bail Act gives the reasons for which the Court may refuse

bail. The first part of sub section (1) of that section reads

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding provisions of

this Act, whenever a person suspected or accused of being concerned in

committing or having committed a bailable or non-bailable offence,

appears, is brought before or surrenders to the court havingjurisdiction,

the court may refuse to release such person on bail or upon application

being made in that behalf by a police officer, and after issuing notice on

the person concerned and hearing him personally or through his

attorney-at-law, cancel a subsisting order releasing such person on bail if the court has reason to believe: "(emphasis added)

10

This section applies to bailable or non bailable offences in the equal force and

the grounds that the Court can refuse bail are also specified. The Court must

have reasons to believe that those grounds exist. Those grounds are;

a) that such person would"

(i) not appear to stand his inquiry or trial;

(ii) interfere with the witnesses or the evidence against him or

otherwise obstruct the course of justice; or

(iii) commit an offence while on bail; or

(b)that the particular gravity of, and public reaction to, the alleged

offence may give rise to public disquiet.

In the case of Anuruddha Ratwatte And Others V. The Attorney General [2003]

2 Sri L R 39 at 48,49 it has been held that;

It is seen that Section 14(1) would apply notwithstanding anything to the

contrary in the other provisions of the Act, in respect of persons

suspected or accused of being concerned in or having committed a

bailable or non-bailable offence. It covers two situations

(i)when such person appears or is brought before or surrenders to, the

court having jurisdiction;

(ii)when an application is made to cancel a subsisting order releasing

such person on bail.

In both situations the court may refuse to release the suspect or accused

on bail or cancel a subsisting order of bail only if the court has reason to

believe that such person would act in the manner specified in paragraph

(a), (i) to (iii) referred to above or the court has reason to believe that the

gravity and public reaction to 310 the offence may give rise to public

disquiet.

The Learned ASG stressed his objections only on two grounds, that is firstly

that the Petitioner would not stand her trial and secondly that the particular

gravity of, and public reaction to, the alleged offence may give rise to public

disquiet.

The reason for the first ground urged by the Learned ASG is that the petitioner

was absconding for a long time. Absconding is not a reason to refuse bail under

section 14 (1) (a)(i) of the Bail Act. The Learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner stressed on this point. My view is that purposely keeping away from

Court can be considered against the Petitioner when the probabilities of not

standing trial are considered. In the present case it is true that the Petitioner was

absent from Court for a long time, but the police was unable to arrest and

produce her before Court even after issuing a Red Notice until she decided to

come back to the Island. She came back knowingly that she will be apprehended

on the arrival. As expected, she was arrested at the airport. If the Petitioner

wanted to stay away from the trial, she would have stayed where she was and

would have received better medical facilities. With all that, she came back to Sri

Lanka voluntarily. The Learned ASG submitted that there is no evidence to

show that she came voluntarily. She was not brought to Sri Lanka by any

authority. As such, her return is a voluntary act. Under these circumstances,

there is no reason to believe that the Petitioner will not stand for trial.

The second point urged by the Learned ASG is that the particular gravity of, and

public reaction to, the alleged offence may give rise to public disquiet. The

Learned ASG submits that the large amount of money involved in this case had

a negative impact on financial institutes of this country. He further says that it

being the depositors' money, there could be public disquiet. It is true that the

amount of money involved in this case is of very high magnitude. But the

Learned ASG did not submit any evidence to show that the financial institutes

of this country had any impact because of the financial crisis of the Golden Key

Credit Card Company. (All the charges in the indictment are in relation to the

said company.) Except the Petitioner, all the other accused, including the

husband of the Petitioner who was considered as the major shareholder of the

company by the Learned High Court Judge, were released on bail and only the

Petitioner is in remand. Therefore there is no reason to believe that there could

be a public disquiet in releasing the Petitioner on bail.

At this stage I would like record my disapproval on certain submissions made

by the Learned ASG. He suggested that this Court could issue a directive to the

High Court to give priority to this case and to take up on day to day basis to

finish early and to keep the Petitioner in remand until then. I do not incline to

agree with this suggestion. If this case gets priority and is taken up day to day

basis, all the other cases in that Court will not reach to the conclusion during

that period. The litigants in those cases also have a legitimate right to get their

cases heard. Therefore, if I direct to give priority to this case, I am denying the

rights of the other litigants, who have nothing to do with this case, just to avoid

one person releasing on bail; especially when there is no reason to keep that

person in remand. Therefore, I cannot agree with this suggestion.

The Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the rule in

relation to the bail under the Bail Act is to give bail and the exception is the

refusal. In response to this Learned ASG submitted that if this rule is adopted

even a rapists will go free. I believe that this is not the view of the Attorney

General's Department, but is the personal view of the Learned ASG. The golden

rule of our law is that a person is presumed to be innocent until he/she is proved

to be guilty. Therefore any person accused or suspect of a rape cannot and

should not be called as a rapist. He is only an accused or a suspect of a rape with

the constitutional safeguard (Article 13(5) of the Constitution) of innocence

until he is proved to be a rapist. Therefore I wish to record my disapproval on

the comment made by the Learned ASG on the rule of bail enacted by the

13

Legislature. The duty of the Court is to give effect to the laws enacted by the

Parliament and it is for the Parliament to decide whether any law should prevail

or not.

I act in revision and set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

23.02.2016 marked as P 15(a). I order to release the 6th Accused Petitioner on

bail on the following terms.

1. Cash bail ofRs. 100000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand)

2. Personal bail of Rs 1000000/- (Rupees One Million) with two sureties.

(The Learned High Court Judge has to decide the suitability of the

sureties.)

3. The 6th Accused Petitioner should surrender the passport and any other

travel document in her custody to the Court.

4. The 6th Accused Petitioner should not leave the country without obtaining

prior permission from the High Court.

5. If the 6th Accused Petitioner or any surety is changing the address given

in the bail bond, should inform Court and the Complainant Respondent

forthwith.

I direct the Registrar of this Court to communicate this order to the High Court

Colombo.
