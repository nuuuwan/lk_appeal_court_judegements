Before: Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA) &.

P. Padman Surasena J

Counsel: Mahinda Nanayakkara with Aruna Jayathilake for the

Substituted Defendant Appellants

Mayura Gunawansha for the Substituted Plaintiff Respondent

Argued on: 2016-03-08

Decided on: 2016-05-11

JUDGMENT

P. Padman Surasena 1

The plaintiff Respondent has filed action in the District Court of Kalutara in

January 1994. After the conclusion of the trial, learned District Judge

pronounced his judgment dated 1997-05-30 in favour of the Plaintiff

Respondent. Defendant Appellant being dissatisfied, has lodged this appeal

to this co~ against the judgment of the District Court.

4

Defendant Appellant in the prayers of his petition of appeal has sought from

this court inter alia

a) to set aside the judgment and decree entered in this case by the

learned District Judge.

b) to dismiss the Plaintiff Respondent's action

Learned counsel for both parties having filed their written submissions at an

earlier occasion, also filed additional written submissions in support of their

respective positions after concluding their oral submissions on 2016-03-08.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Defendant Appellant,

(i) that the action has been filed in terms of Roman Dutch Law and not

in terms of Section 39(2) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance No. 39

of 1941.

(ii) that the action has been filed by the Plaintiff in the District Court of

Kalutara in violation of section 39(2) of the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance No. 39 of 1941, i.e. without making the payment of debt

together with the interest thereon as ordered by the Debt

Conciliation Board, and hence, the District Court cannot hear and

5

determine this matter for want of jurisdiction, which he terms as

patent lack of jurisdiction.

(iii) that the Plaintiff cannot vindicate his title to the property without

complying with the order of the Debt Conciliation Board as the

certificate issued by the Debt Conciliation Board becomes valid only

when the Plaintiff complies with the said order.

In order to consider the above arguments advanced by the learned counsel

for the Defendant Appellant, it is necessary at this stage to turn to Section

39(2) (a) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance. That section is reproduced

below.

"5. 39(1) .......

(2) Where a certificate has been granted under this Ordinance in respect of

a debt secured by a conditional transfer of immovable property and

subsequent to the granting of that certificate an action is instituted in any

court for the recovery of that property, the court-

(a) may, notwithstanding that the title to that property has vested in

the creditor in relation to that debt, make such appropriate orders

as are necessary to reconvey title to, and possession of, that

(b)

6

property to the debtor, in relation to that debt, on the payment by

the debtor of the debt together with the interest thereon in such

instalments and within such period not exceeding ten years, as the

court thinks fit; and

"

Perusal of the plaint filed in this case reveals

(i) that there has been proceedings before the Debt Conciliation Board in

terms of the provisions of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance.

(ii) that the Debt Conciliation Board after the inquiry has issued a

certificate under Section 29 of the Ordinance, a copy of which has

been annexed to the plaint.

Plaintiff Respondent in paragraph 10 of his plaint has also stated that he is

prepared to pay the debt and the interest thereof to the Defendant Appellant

at any time according to the terms and conditions ordered by court.

The Plaintiff Respondent in his Plaint has prayed for

(i) a reconveyance of the property in dispute back to him from the

Defendant Appellant.

7

(ii) eviction of the Defendant Appellant and to retake the possession of

the said property back to him.

It is evident from the above facts that the action filed by the Defendant

Appellant is an action in terms of Section 39(2) (a) of the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance. Further the granting of the reliefs sought by the Defendant

Appellant in his prayers are well within the jurisdiction of the court in terms

of Section 39(1) (2) (a) as it has specifically provided for the court to make

such appropriate orders as are necessary to re-convey title to, and

possession of that property to the debtor, in relation to that debt, on the

payment by the debtor of the debt together with the interest thereon in such

installments and within such period not exceeding 10 years as the court

thinks fit.

Perusal of the issues and the admissions recorded which is at page 57 of the

brief and the answers provided by the learned District Judge to these issues

in his judgment show that all parties had treated this as an action in terms

of section 39 (2) (a) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance.

8

Perusal of the judgment of the learned District Judge, also shows that the

reconveyance has been ordered subject to the condition that the Plaintiff

Respondent pays back the debt to the Defendant Appellant.

For the foregoing reasons this court is of the view that there is no merit in

the arguments advanced on behalf of the Defendant Appellant.

Hence, they cannot and should not succeed.

In these circumstances we affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 1997-05-30 and dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
