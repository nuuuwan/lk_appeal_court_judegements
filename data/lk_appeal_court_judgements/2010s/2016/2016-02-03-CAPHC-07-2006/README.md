CASE-NO- CA (PHC) 071 2006- JUDGMENT - 14.01.2016

P.R.Walgama, J

This appeal is directed against the order dated 06.12.2005 of the

Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle in the Revision Application

made by the 1 st to 3rd Respondents, and to make order

affirming the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 22.03.2004.

The facts need mention in brief to appreciate the issue involved

in this appeal are as follows;

On 05.01.2004 the Officer III charge of the Kegalle Police filed

an information report III terms of Section 66 of the Primary

Court Act No. 44 of 1979 in respect of a land dispute which

has threatened the breach of the peace or likely to occur the

breach of the peace.

3

IIi !III

The said information was tendered to court in pursuant to a

complaint made by the 2nd Party Respondent against the 1st Party

Respondent for obstructing the road way used by the party of

the 2nd Part Respondent.

The 2nd Party - Respondent made a statement to the Police,

stating that the 1 st Party - Respondent had obstructed his road

way. The 1st Party - Respondent - Appellant has made a complaint

on 18.11.2003 to the said effect and the 1 st Party - Respondent

has made a complaint of a assault by the 2nd Party-

Respondent.

The Learned Magistrate in the above said impugned order has

arrived at the conclusion that, as stated in the affidavits tendered

by the parties, do not reveal a land dispute which has

threatened the breach of the peace, and as such has held that,

the circumstances do not warrant to make order m terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Act. But it is quite apparent

from the complaint made by the 2nd Party-Respondent, that the

1 st Party - Respondent -Appellant had obstructed his road way. In

the above setting it is ostensible that there had been a land

dispute which has culminated to a breach of the peace. Hence

the materials on record as a whole, has established, that the

Learned Magistrate necessarily should have made an order,

deciding the dispute, which he has failed to do. Therefore this

Court is of the view that the impugned order of the Learned

Magistrate is unmeritorious and should be set aside.

Being aggrieved by

Respondents- Petitioners

the

had

said impugned order,

made an application

the

by

2nd Party-

way of

4

tI i !I

tt

;.

revlston to the Provincial High Court of Kegalle to have the

said order set aside or vacate.

The Respondents - Petitioners had assailed the said order on the

basis that the Learned Magistrate has failed to consider and

make an order m terms of Section 69 of the

there

above Act, as

by made an the dispute relates to a road way, and

erroneous order which is detrimental to the Petitioners.

The Learned High Court Judge in deciding the above lssue was

of the Vlew that the 1 st Party - Respondent - Appellant has

obstructed the road way that was used by the Petitioners and

therefore the Learned Magistrate should have made an appropriate

order in terms of Section 69 of the above Act.

In considering the facts placed before the Learned High Court

Judge, was convinced of the fact that the Petitioners had been

usmg the alleged road way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court

Judge, the 1st Party - Respondent -Appellant has preferred the

instant appeal seeking to set aside the said order, and to affirm

the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Although the 1 st Party - Respondent - Appellant has lodged this

appeal, did not appear in Court on the date the case was fixed

for Argument. But nevertheless has paid the brief fees, but not

obtained the brief. Therefore this Court had the opportunity to

appreciate the argument of the counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Party

- Respondent - Petitioner - Respondents.

The counsel for the Petitioners - Respondents has contended m

the written submissions that according to the Affidavits and the

5

other documents which are marked as V 1 to V 14 and the

Inspection Report of the Police clearly indicate that the

Respondents had been using the alleged road way.

The Respondents had also adverted Court to the fact that the 151

Party - Respondent - Appellant has made reference to the said road

way which has been used by the Respondents.

As the disputed matter relates to a road way, the Counsel for

the Respondents had taken this Court through the legal

propositions adumbrated by the judicial pronouncement as stated

herein below.

It was observed In the case of DAMMADHINNA SARA TH

PARANAGAMA .VS. KAMITHA AS\VIN PAR.A .. NAGA!v!A.-CA-

(PHC)- APN 117/2013, that there are two ways in existence of a

such a road can be proved in the Primary Court, They are;

1. By adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a

Civil Court,

2. By offering proof that he IS entitled to the right for the

time being.

It was further held that "if you described a party as being

entitled to enjoy a right but for the time being, it means that

it will be like that for a period of time, but may change in

the future" (emphasis added).

In the case of R. MALKANTHI SILVA .VS. L.G.Rj~. FERERA-

CA (PHC) 78/2008 - in recognising the cardinal principle laid down

in the case of RAMALINGAM .VS. THANGARAJAH (1982) 2-

SLR - 693, and was of the view that any right claimed under

In the above exposition of the facts and thee legal matrix, I am

of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has arrived at

the above determination In the correct perspective, hence the

appeal should stand dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed accordingly.
