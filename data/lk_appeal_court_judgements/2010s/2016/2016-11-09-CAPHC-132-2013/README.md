This is an appeal from an order of the High Court ofNegombo. The facts

of the case are briefly as follows. The police filed a report in the

Magistrate Court Minuwangoda On 20.02.2011 under section 81 of the

Criminal Procedure Code seeking for an order to show cause why they

should not be ordered to execute a bond to keep the peace. The learned

Magistrate on 21.01.2011 made an order preventing the 2nd Party

Petitioner Appellant Yen. Aluthapola Rathanaloka Thero who was the

viharadhipathy of the temple called Aswana Sri Dharmarathanodaya

Piriven Viharaya of Minuwangoda, (hereinafter called and referred to as

the Appellant), from entering in to the temple. On 24.02.2011 the learned.

Magistrate extended the order by prohibiting the Appellant from coming

to the area. Thereafter the learned Magistrate again confirmed the said

order on 27.07.2011.

The order dated 27.07.2011 explained the reasons for ordering the

Appellant to refrain from coming to the temple. She says that her prime

motive was to prevent the breach of the peace of the area and to see that

the lives of the people, the police officers and the Appellant are been

3

protected. The court went on to comment on an incident took place

Katunayaka and stated that there was a possibility of occurring a similar

situation in her jurisdiction. Court further said that there were about 300

people gathered in the Court premises and has come to the conclusion

that they are Dayakayas of the temple and they were there to protest

against the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

moved in revision in the High Court of Negombo. The learned High

Court Judge dismissed the said application and this appeal is from the

said dismissal.

Section 81 of the Criminal Procedure Code is as follows.

81. Whenever a Magistrate receives information that any person is

likely to commit a breach of the peace or to do any wrongful act

that may probably occasion a breach of the peace within the local

limits of the jurisdiction of the court of such Magistrate, or that

there is within such limits a person who is likely to commit a

breach of the peace or do any wrongful act as aforesaid in any

place beyond such limits the Magistrate may in manner hereinafter

provided require such person to show cause why he should not be

ordered to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the

peace for such period not exceeding two years as the court thinks

fit tofix.

The only order that the Magistrate can made under this section is to order

that person to show cause as to why he should not be ordered to execute a

bond to keep the peace. Under section 87 the Court can order to execute a

bond. The section reads;

4

87. If upon such inquiry it is proved that it is necessary for keeping

the peace or maintaining good behaviour, as the case may be, that

the person in respect of whom the inquiry is made should execute a

bond with or without sureties, the Magistrate shall make an order

accordingly;

The Criminal Procedure Code does not provide for the Magistrate to

dispossess a person from his property in the guise of preventing the

breach of the peace under section 81. It is common ground that at the

time of filing the information the Appellant was the viharadhipathy of the

temple. The learned Magistrate has stated that in her order dated

27.07.2011 that she has exercised the inherent power of the Court. The

inherit power of the Court does not extend to dispossess a viharadhipathy

and give the key to the "Dayaka Sabhawa" in an application under section

81. If there is an issue between the viharadhipathy and the devotees, they

should have resolved it among themselves, the Court should not get

involved in to those issues. If the devotees want to remove the

viharadhipathy, they must do it in the proper way; they cannot attack the

priest or the devotees who support him or police officers. The action must

be taken against those who committed the breach of the peace and the

Court should not have involved in removing the priest.

The learned Magistrate has concluded the proceeding on 29.12.2011

ordering to handover the key to another priest called Ven. Makuddala

Chandraloka Thero. Further directed that the Appellant can enter the

temple only on the written permission of the Mahanayaka Thero (High

Priest) of the Malwatta Chapter.

The application of the police is to order the parties to show cause as to

why they should not be ordered to execute a bond to keep the peace. The

case has been concluded without ordering the parties to enter in to a bond.

5

But the Court terminated the proceedings with a resulting position is that

the Court had removed the viharadhipathy in a summary manner. Order

of this nature cannot allow to stand.

Accordingly I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated

26.08.2013 and the orders of the learned Magistrate dated 21.01.2011,

24.02.2011 and 27.07 2011.

Appeal allowed.
