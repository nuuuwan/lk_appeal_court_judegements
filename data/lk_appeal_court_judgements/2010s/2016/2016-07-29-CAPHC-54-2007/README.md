P.R. Walgama, J

The instant application In reVIsIOn lies against the

order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

09.12.2005, and the order of the Learned Magistrate

dated 22.05.2007.

A brief synopsIs of the facts led to the said

application are as follows;

The applicant being the competent authority instituted

action against the. Respondent -Petitioner and moved

for an order of ejectment from the schedule property

in plan No. 35/14 marked as X2.

The above action was filed In the Magistrate Court of

Anuradhapura by the Respondent under the Provincial

Land Statute No.2 of 2002.

The Learned Magistrate after considering the facts

placed before him had issued an order for ejectment

of the Respondent - Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent-

Petitioner moved the High Court In revlslOn to have

the said order set aside.

In the said application the Learned High Court Judge

has considered the Issue rruse by the Petitioner In

the Magistrate Court and has dealt with the

dispu ted issue accordingly.

The Learned High Court Judge has 0 bserved the fact

that the Petitioner was In occupation of a State

VIew that the petitioner IS not entitled to question

the legality of the said notice.

In addition the Learned High Court Judge has

adverted to the fact that the interpretation gIVen to

the 'Competent Authority' In terms of Section 18 (1) of

the State Land Recovery of Possession Act No. 58 of

1981, and held that the contention of the Petitioner

has no merits as the ejectment notice has been sent

by an officer properly authorised to do so.

Further the Learned High Court Judge has held that

the petitioner has another cause of action In the

event of the land being acquired by the State. In

that it IS said that the Petitioner could file action to

claim damages.

In the said backdrop the Learned High Court Judge

has dismissed the application accordingly. Further it is

commented by the High Court Judge, that although

the Petitioner has averred that she had been in the

disputed land for 30 years, but has failed to prove

the same.

It is to be noted that the petitioner was absent and

unrepresented on the date of the Argument and this

Court had the opportunity to hear the argument of

the counsel for the Respondent only.

In opposIng the above application of the Petitioner,

the Respondent moves for a dismissal of the said

It is contended by the Respondent that, the right of

The said rationale was recognised by their Lordship

It is observed that from the petition tendered that the

Petitioner has not adhered to the afore said
