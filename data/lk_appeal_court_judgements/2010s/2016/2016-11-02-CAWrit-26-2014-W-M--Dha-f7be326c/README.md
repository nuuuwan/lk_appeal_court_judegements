Petitioner to the present application W.M. Danapala Menike had come before this court seeking

relief as prayed in paragraphs (c) -en) of the petition. However when this petition was supported

before this court on 19.02.2014, the court after considering the material placed, decided to issue

notices only as regard to the relief prayed in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the petition to the effect;

c) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing P-lO

d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing P-l1

e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing P-12

The Petitioner's father Wellakkutti Mudiyanselage Podi Bandara had received two grants bearing

numbers, Rat/Pra/700 dated 20.04.1982 and Rat/Pra/4318 dated 03.07.1986 under the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance No 19 of 1935 (as amended). As revealed before this court the

said Podi Bandara was married to one Muthuthanthrilage Podi Menike and had five children from

the said marriage. The said Muthuthanthrilage Podi Menike had pre deceased her husband and the

said grantee Podi Bandara too had died on 26.06.1997 without nominating a successor to the said

grants.

As revealed before this court Wellakutti Mudiyanselage Podi Bandara and Muthuthanthrilage Podi

Menike had five children from the said marriage namely,

4. Muthuthanthrilage Gunathilake Menike (born on 10.01.1955)

5. W.M. Gunarathne Menike (born on 28.03.1953)

Since the deceased Podi Bandara did not nominate a successor during his life time to the above

mentioned lands, the eldest of his children the 51h Respondent had become entitled to succeed to the

said lands by operation of section 72 together with the order of priority laid down in the third

schedule to the Land Development Ordinance (as amended)

However as revealed before this court the 51h Respondent Madduma Bandara declined to succeed to

the said land and the 2nd eldest son of the said permit holder Podi Bandara namely Wickremasekara

Bandara succeeded to the lands in issue by operation of the said provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.

However as submitted by the Petitioner the said successor Wickremasekara Bandara had died on

05.08.2010 without nominating any successor to the lands in issue. As revealed before this court the

deceased Wickremasekara Bandara was a bachelor at the time of his death.

After the death of Wickremasekara Bandara the Petitioner who is the eldest among the sisters as well

as the 51h Respondent who declined to accept the lands in issue after the death of his father, made a

claim to the lands in issue to the lSI Respondent.

Subsequent to an inquiry held before the lSI Respondent which was attended by the 51h Respondent

and the Petitioner, the lSI Respondent sought advice from the Provincial Land Commissioner. On the

advice received, the lSI Respondent by letter dated 10.06.2011 had communicated his decision to the

Petitioner (lR12).

Subsequent to the said communication the 3rd Respondent had confirmed the said decision by letter

dated 22.06.2011 (P-1O) and based on said decision the lSI Respondent had taken steps to transfer the

ownership of the lands in dispute to the 51h Respondent by P-11 and P-12 instructing i h Respondent

to register the ownership of the 5th Respondent in the relevant folios.

The Petitioner who was aggrieved by the said decision and the steps taken thereafter, had filed the

present application seeking a writ of Certiorari to quash the said P-1O, P-11 and P-12.

As observed by this court, the entire case for the Petitioner is rested on the steps taken by the

Sth Respondent when he declined to succeed to the properties at the time of his father's death. The Sth

Respondent who is the eldest among the brothers, had executed a Deed of Renunciation No. 147S1

dated 02.06.1998 and it was the position taken up by the Petitioner that the Sth Respondent had

renounced all his interests with regard to the lands referred to in the said Deed of Renunciation and

therefore he is estopped in law making a claim to the same lands in question without cancelling the

said Deed of Renunciation.

As observed by this court the Sth Respondent had executed a Deed of Renunciation (P-S) No 147S1

dated 02.06.1998 attested by Sriyani Wijeyagunawardena Notary Public and when going through the

said Deed of Renunciation this court observed that the said Deed of Renunciation was executed after

obtaining permission from the divisional secretary of the area to renounce his rights with regard to

the two lands referred to in this case as against his younger brother Wellankatti Mudiyanselage

Wickremasekara Bandara.

In this regard to the Petitioner relied on the following part of the said Deed of Renunciation to the

effect, " <Wa)@ ooa6Q~ qJ~ o~@o5 162 (1) a(3)~t5)c., 00@o5 qaoO (gQ))@(3)~ qlt5> <W(5)0)t!

(3)l~0 t5>@Q)~ qat5>a)80), 63~0)@ @~)<W@(g~ Q)ao5....... @a~ gO))~O)O e3(50 O)O~. and

argued that the Sth Respondent had renounced all his rights with regard to the lands referred to in the

schedule to the said deed and therefore he is estopped from making a fresh claim to the same lands at

a subsequent stage without cancelling the said deed.

The said argument by the Petitioner was challenged by the Respondents before this court and as

observed by this court the objections raised by the Respondents were two fold.

The Respondents have firstly submitted that, when considering the Deed of Renunciation, the court

should not try to give an interpretation to the parts thereof but should consider the entire document

and try to ascertain the intention of the maker of the said document along with the fact that the

circumstance under which the said document was made.

6

Without prejudice to the said argument raised before this court the Respondents have further argued

that the Land Development Ordinance does not identify any other process to decide the succession

rights when there is no nomination with regard to the successor other than the provisions in section

72 and the order of priority laid down in the third schedule. In the said circumstances the Respondent

argued that, there can't be a nomination based on a Deed of Renunciation and the said nomination

made based on the Deed of Renunciation of the 5th Respondent was illegal and the only valid

nomination before this court is the present nomination made by the 1st Respondent nominating the

5th Respondent under the provisions of section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance and the order

of priority laid down in the third schedule.

With regard to the 1st argument raised by the Respondents, this court observes the following

explanation given by the 5th Respondent in the said Deed of Renunciation with regard to his

decision.

When going through the said Deed of Renunciation this court further observes that the portion relied

by the Petitioner referred to in this judgment had been found immediately after the portion referred

to above.

When going through the portion above, it is clear that,

a) It is Wickremasekara Bandara who occupied the permanent house in lot identified in permit

ad/ g/700 and looked after the tea plantation and other plantations in the lot identified in

permit ad/g/4318

b) The said Wickremasekara Bandara had requested the maker of the Deed of Renunciation to

allow him to get title to the said land by clearing the barriers

c) That the maker of the said Deed of Renunciation was keen to give his brother a clear title to

the land and premises enjoyed by his brother Wickremasekara Bandara

d) That the maker of the said document had obtained permission from the Divisional Secretary

of Kahawatta to renounce the said lands

e) That he is renouncing his rights to the said lands in order for his brother Wickremasekara

Bandara to get a clear title to these lands

f) That he is making the said Deed of Renunciation to fulfill the request made by his brother.

g) That he has renounced his rights to the said lands in favour of his brother Wickremasekara

Bandara and his descendents only but not in favour of the Petitioner who is not a descendent

of Wickremasekara Bandara

In the said circumstances it is clear that the maker of the said Deed of Renunciation had only

renounce his claim, as only against Wickremasekara Bandara and not against anybody and therefore

this court is in agreement with the first argument raised by the Respondent that when considering the

Deed of Renunciation, it is important to consider the whole document rather than giving an

interpretation to parts thereof.

When the said Wickremasekara Bandara had died without nominating a successor the same

provisions of the Land Development Ordinance will apply and the 5th Respondent being the brother

of the deceased Wickremasekara Bandara he will become entitled to be the successor of the said

deceased.

The Petitioner has further challenged the decision of the 1st Respondent appeared in P-9a and

submitted that, the decision to confirm the ownership of the lands in question in the lay name of the

5th Respondent is contrary to the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. As revealed before

this court, at the time the present application was filed the 5th Respondent had become a Buddhist

Priest by the name Ven. Pelmadulle Dammagaweshi Thero and the objection of the Petitioner was

that the 5th Respondent being a Buddhist monk was not a person who was eligible to be granted a

land governed under the Land Development Ordinance.

8

However from the material already discussed in this judgment, it is clear that the decision of the lSI

respondent was based on the provisions in section 72 and the order of priority laid down in the 3rd

schedule and nowhere in the said section prevented a person getting his succession rights just

because he has decided to become a Buddhist Priest, and therefore I see no merit in the said

argument.

Even though this court is in agreement with the lSI argument raised by the Respondents and also

decided to reject the argument of the Petitioner, this court would also like to consider the second

argument raised by the Respondents since the said argument created a doubt on the steps taken by

the lSI Respondent when he declared Wickremasekara Bandara as the successor subsequent to the

Deed of Renunciation by the 51h Respondent. In this regard this court is mindful, that the Land

Development Ordinance had not provided any special provision for a person who becomes entitled

to be declared as the successor to a permit or grant to reject his claim but there is no specific

provision prohibiting notarially executing an instrument other than under section 162 of the said Act.

Section 162 of the Land Development Ordinance (as amended) reads thus,

162 (1) A Notary shall not attest any instrument operating as a disposition of a holding which

contravenes the provision of this Ordinance

(2) An instrument executed or attested in contravention of the provisions of this section

shall be null and void

As observed by this court the above section had only referred to the making of a document

"operating as a disposition a holding" and in the said context the maker of the document should

possessed the holding at the time he make the document. In the present case as referred to above in

this judgment, the maker of the Deed of Renunciation had renounced his claims against his brother

over the Lands in question and he was not in possession of the Lands at the time he executed the said

deed. In these circumstances the Deed of Renunciation prepared by the 51h Respondent does not

come within the provision of section 162 of the Land Development Ordinance (as amended)

Even though section 72 taken together with Rule 1 of the 3rd schedule had not provided for a refusal

by the successor to a holding, it is not correct to say that the Land Development Ordinance is silent

on the right to refusal by a successor since section 68 (2) of the Land Development Ordinance refers

to a situation where a nominated successor refuses to succeed to a holding.

9

In these circumstances this court observes that a person's right to refuse succession under section 72

together with the order of priority under Rule 1 of the 3rd schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance has not been taken away and a Deed of Renunciation made by him disclaiming his rights

in order to refuse succession against another cannot be rejected in the absence of specific Prohibition

in the Land Development Ordinance.

In the said circumstances this court is not inclined to accept the second argument raised on behalf of

the Respondents.

However as observed above, this court is not in agreement with the arguments raised by the

Petitioner, and is of the view that the impugned decision conveyed to the Petitioner by P-lO and the

steps taken thereafter to register the ownership under P-ll and P-12 had been carried out under the

provisions identified in the Land Development Ordinance (as amended).

For the forgoing reasons I dismissed this application but make no order with regard to costs.

Application Dismissed.
