The petitioner has come before this Court seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in documents marked PI

and P7 and Writ of Mandamus Compelling the respondents to take

steps to re-instate the petitioner to the Sri Lanka Army. As revealed

by the submissions of the counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner

has been discharged by the Army after withdrawing his commission

by His Excellency the President in the year 2009. Petitioner has

challenged the said decision by way of a Writ application before this

Court in the year 2009 and this Court after considering the material

placed before Court has refused the said application. Thereafter the

petitioner has gone before the Supreme Court against the said order

2

but he was not successful. By way of the present application the

petitioner is trying to canvas the same decision of the Army which

was taken in the year 2009. However the learned Counsel submits

that the grounds for the present application are different to the

grounds the petitioner had placed previously. Even though the

counsel submits before us a subsequent acquittal of the petitioner in

the Magistrate's Court proceedings in the year 2010, when going

through the order made by their Lordships in the year 2009 we

observed that their Lordships were mindful of the Criminal case

pending in the Chavakachcheri Magistrate's Court . Petitioner now

takes up the position that he was discharged from the said

proceeding by the Magistrate in the year 2010, but he has waited

until 2016 to canvas the said fact before this Court. However we

observe that the decision to discharge from Army was taken initially

in the year 2007 by the then Commander of Army on disciplinary

grounds which was confirmed by another decision of a subsequent

Commander of the Army in the year 2008. The petitioner submits

that there was contrary decision in the year 2004 but all these issues

had been looked into by their Lordships' when they decided to refuse

notice in the said application. When considering these issues we see

no reasons for this Court to issue notice once again sine this Court

and the Supreme Court has once looked into this matter previously.

Therefore we are not inclined to issue notices at this stage.

Accordingly, we dismiss this application.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P .Padman Surasena,J.

I agree.
