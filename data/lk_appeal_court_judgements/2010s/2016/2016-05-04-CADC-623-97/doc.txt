It is common ground that the subject nremlses were ... owned by the National Housing Development Authority.

The PI ain tiff- Respondent entered In to a Lease

Agreement marked PI with the National Housing

Authority.

It is the position of the Plaintiff - Respondent that

the Defendant - Appellant came to the posseSSIOn of

the premises in suit with leave and license of

the Plaintiff. Further it is noted that the Plaintiff

- Respondent

Authority by

has

his

informed the

letters marked

National Housing

as P2 and PIS

that he has gIven the house to the Defendant

to be looked after In his absence, from October

1988. Therefore it IS with the knowledge of

the National

premIses were

and therefore

Housing

gIven to

there IS

the

Authority, the suit

Defendant - Appellant,

no violation of the

aforesaid Agreement by the Plaintiff terms of the

as alleged by

noted that the

the Defendant - Appellant. It IS to be

Defendant - Appellant IS the brother

of the wife of the Plaintiff whom he has

divorced.

On 21.11.1989 the Plaintiff has by his letter marked

P4 requested to hand over the vacant possession of

the premIses to the Plaintiff, which was ignored and refused by the Defendant. In the course of the evidence

of the Defendant- Appellant has transpired that in fact

he has no right to be in the premises.

But it IS seen from the Answer of the Defendant,

that he planked his defence on the basis that i:..t: is

a tenant, which position was totally changed In his

testimony to Court.

As the Defendant - Appellant has emphasized the fact

that as the Plaintiff - Respondent has violated the

said Agreement to vito By not paYIng the rent to

the National Housing Authority the said Agreement IS

no longer in force, therefore the Plaintiff is not entitled

to institute the action in the District Court to recover

possession of the said premIses. The Learned District

Judge was of the VIew that the said purported

Agreement marked PI has not been tt:'rmjr18.t~d 8:n.d

as such it IS still In force. Therefore any action

against the Plaintiff-Respondent could be taken only

by the National Housing Authority and the Defendant-

Appellant has no locus to take any objection In

respect of any matter ansIng out of the above

agreement marked PI. Therefore it IS abundantly clear

that the afore said Agreement IS In existence and in

force.

The pith and substance of the Plaintiff - Respondent's

case IS that the Defendant - Appellant was entrusted

to take care of the suit premIses and had not

demand or accepted any rent from him. Therefore the

Defendant - Appellant does not get the protection of a

tenant to be in this disputed premises.

It IS abundantly clear that the Plaintiff - Respondent

has not accepted a rent from the Defendant - Appellant,

and the Learned District Judge In evaluating the

testimony of the Defendant has

evidence In Court was that he lent a sum of Rs.

15,000/ to his sister who was the former wife of the

Plaintiff to go abroad and In order to set it off the

Defendant - Appellant has come in to occupation of the

said premIses. Therefore it IS pertinent to note that

there had not been a contract of tenancy exist between

the Plaintiff - Respondent and Defendant - Appellant. It is

intensely relevant to note that the Defendant had

never taken up the said position In his Answer.

In the above setting the Learned District Judge has

categorically stated that Defendant's verSlOn lS not

trustworthy and lacks probity.

Further the Defendant - Appellant

objection of the maintainability of

has raised the

the Plain tiff's

action as it has been prescribed. It IS stated

In the impugned judgment that any matter

relating to any righ ts of a party an action

could be brought within ten years.

In the said back drop when the impugned

judgment IS reviewed this Court IS of the

view that the said judgment IS unattended with

errors.

For the foregoing reasons the Appeal IS dismissed

su bject to a cost of Rs. 5000 / .

Appeal IS dismissed accordingly.
