However the Petitioner did not pursue the relief prayed in paragraph (C) above during the

argument and limited the argument to the relief prayed in paragraph (B) only.

The petitioner who has joined the 1st Respondent Bank on 01.08.1988 as Grade (IV) Officer and

earned the promotions as follows,

a) Promoted to Grade 111/111 1996

b) Promoted to Grade 111/11 01.01.2000

c) Promoted to Grade 111/1 05.06.2003

d) Promoted to Grade 11 26.05.2007

e) Promoted to Grade 1/1 01.12.2008

and was confirmed in Grade 1 in the Bank Service with effect from 01.12.2008. She was

also appointed to the post of Regional Manager with effect from 01.01.2013 and was appointed

to North Central Region.

In June and October 2014 the Petitioner had submitted applications for the post of Assistant

General Managers which were fall vacant during the said period but, by letter dated 11.11.2014

issued by the 3rd Respondent the Petitioner was transferred to the credit division with immediate

effect, but was not assign with any specific work and called upon to attend to unspecified areas

of work as and when it arises.

During this period the Petitioner was served with a letter dated 14.07. 2014 where in the Deputy

General Manager Audit had brought to the notice of the Petitioner about certain payments

received by the Petitioner (P44) and thereafter by letter dated 12.01.2015 the 3rd Respondent had

informed the interdiction of the Petitioner with immediate effect.

In this regard the petitioner has relied on the Disciplinary Code prepared under section 84 of the

National Savings Bank Act No 30 of 1971 which is produced marked P-1 before this court.

However when this matter was taken up before this court the Respondents raised a preliminary

objection to the maintainability of the present application on the ground that the matter referred

to the present application relates and emanates from a contract of employment between an

employer and employee and therefore not amenable to judicial review by way of public law

remedies, namely prerogative writs ...

Whilst raising the said preliminary objection the Respondents conceded that section 84 of the

National Savings Bank Act recognizes and empowers the Board of the said Bank to make rules

under section 84 (1) and (2) for matters stipulated in the said subsections including powers to

make rules pertaining to appointment promotion, remuneration, disciplinary control and conduct

of the officers and servants of the Bank and the grant of leave to them under 84 (2) (b) of the said

Act, but argued that the said subsections should read together with subsection (3) which read

thus,

"Every rule made under this Act by the Board shall be published in the Gazette, and shall

come in to operation on such date as maybe specified in such rules or if no such date is so

specified, on the date of such pUblication."

and submitted that such rules should necessarily be published in the Gazette as it is a

mandatory requirement under the Notional Savings Bank Act. In this regard Respondents have

submitted two contradictory arguments before this court.

As submitted by the Respondents, they argued in one hand that it is mandatory to publish in the

Gazette the rules made under section 84 (1) and (2) of the Act but at the same time took up the

position that, since the Act recognizes and empowers the board to make rules in relation to

matters specified therein the Board can make such rules in order to regulate its internal affairs

and functions of the Bank.

5

In the said circumstances the Respondents argued that, for such rules to have a statutory flavour

within the context of the National Savings Bank Act, they have to be published in the Gazette in

terms of section 84 (3), but still the bank can make use of the rules which are not published under

section 84 (3) but the only defence is that the said rules cannot be considered as rules having a

statutory flavour.

As observed by this court, both the said arguments cannot be considered as correct since they are

contradictory to each other. In this regard this court is mindful of the decision in Nanayakkara

v. the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and Others (1981) 2 Sri LR 52 at 59

and 61 where Thambiah (J) had observed,

(Page 59)

(Page 61)

"I cannot accept the submission of Learned Counsel for the 151 Respondent that

the Regulations in Manual of Procedure (R1) were not framed under statute.

Section 12 of the Act No 23 of 1959 empowers the council to make regulation in

respect of the following, amongst other matters- salaries allowances conditions of

service, and the excise of the disciplinary control over officers and servants of the

council."

The regulations in the Manual of Procedure, which have become part of Act

No 23 of 1959, have made inroads into the common law by regulating the

ground of removal of an employee (Section 11 Paragraph 12) and the

procedure to removal after inquiry. (Section 111 Paragraph 22.3) I agree with

the submission of Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the Petitioners

employment has a statutory flavor, which differentiates his employment from the

ordinary relationship of master and servant. The Manual Procedure (Rl) give

rights to employee and imposes obligations on the employer, which go

6

beyond the ordinary contract of service. An employee can be dismissed only on

specified grounds and he is entitled to an inquiry before dismissal." (Emphasis

added)

Even though the Respondents have made an attempt to differentiate the facts of the case in hand

with the above case by referring to the provisions in the National Savings Bank Act, I see no

merit in the said argument when considering the matters referred to above in the observations

made by Thambiah (1) in the said Judgment.

In the said circumstance I see no merit in the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents

before this court.

As observed above the main complaint made by the Petitioner before this court is the non

compliance of the Disciplinary Rules of the National Savings Bank when interdicting the

Petitioner.

In this regard the Petitioner has drawn my attention to part V of the Disciplinary Code which

deals with the interdiction of an employee and Delegation of Powers Order referred to in the 151

schedule of the Disciplinary Code.

Whilst referring to rule 5.1 of the Disciplinary Code the Petitioner argued that the decision

conveyed by P45, interdicting the services of the Petitioner was made, without any existing

reason to interdict the Petitioner since Rule 5.1 requires the order to interdict a person has to be

made by the disciplinary officer, if he considers that permitting the employee to continue in

service would be detrimental.

In the said circumstances the Petitioner argued that the said decision conveyed by P45 is made

ultra-virus, in violation of the Rules of National Justice, unreasonable and made mala fide for

collateral reasons to victimize the Petitioner.

,

I I ' 7 I 1 The Petitioner had further challenged the validity of the interdiction on the basis that the said I J

J

interdiction order was not signed by the Disciplinary Officer as referred to under Delegation of

Powers Order.

As observed by this court, the Petitioner is a Grade One Officer of the Respondent Bank and

according to schedule 1 the Disciplinary Officer is the General Manager of the Bank but P45 is

signed by Deputy General Manager (Human Resource)

During the argument before this court the Petitioner had only admitted issuing a letter dated

14.07.2014 (P44) by the Assistant General Manager Audit to which she replied by letter dated

27.08.2014 (P37) with annexure which were produced before this court marks P38 to P43 and

thereafter recording a statement from her by the Assistant General Manager Audit in December

2014.

However during the arguments before this court the Respondents place before the court that,

a) During the course of an internal audit inspection it was ascertained that the Petitioner had

submitted receipts, and obtained certain sums of monies as traveling allowance contrary

I I

to the instructions provided in the letter dated 31.01.2013, P43,

b) There upon an internal memo P44, was dispatched to the Petitioner bringing to the

attention of the Petitioner about the said misappropriation and requesting the Petitioner to

reimburse the said amount of money that had wrongfully paid to her,

c) In response to P44, the Petitioner sends P37 together with photo copies of annexed

documents marked respectively as P38, P39, P40, P41, P42 and P43,

d) upon perusal of the said document submitted by the Petitioner the Internal Audit

Department of the Respondent Bank decided to call for a report from the Department of

Government Analyst with regard to the letter which was produced marked P38,

e) Examiner of Questioned Document from the Government Analyst Department by his

Report dated 14.11.2014 (lR9) confirmed several alterations, inter polations and

introductions in the said document relied by the Petitioner,

t) Thereafter, a preliminary investigation was conducted by the Audit Division of the Bank

under the auspices of the Assistant General Manager (Audit) into this matter and

accordingly the Petitioner was summoned to record a statement and a comprehensive

statement was recorded from the Petitioner,(lRlO)

g) Additionally statements from several subordinate officers who worked at the Regional

office under the Petitioner were also recorded at the said preliminary investigation,

h) Thereafter, a report was prepared and submitted to the 2nd Respondent by the Deputy

General Manager (Audit) (lR11),

i) The said report was finally submitted to the Board of Directors of the Respondent Bank

by the General Manager with his decision and finally the Board of Directors had given its

approval for the decision taken by the General Manger to interdict and to serve a charge

sheet under schedule' A' and proceed for formal inquiry

As observed by this court, the Petitioner has failed to submit any of these materials before this

court when she came before this court and sought relief as referred to above. When submitting

her case before this court the Petitioner once again relied on her own document P38 which was

confirmed to be a forged document by none other than the Examiner of Questioned Documents.

In these circumstances I observe that the Petitioner has failed to come before this court with

clean hands, when she sought relief in the nature of a prerogative writ.

In the leading case of R.V. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners (1917)1 KB 486 Scrutton

LJ observed that ....... an applicant who does not come with candid facts and clear hands cannot

hold a writ of the court soiled hands suppression or concealment of material facts is not

advocacy. It is jugglery, which has no place in equitable and prerogative jurisdiction.

In the case of Alponso Appuhamy Vs. L. Hettiarachchi and Another 1973 NLR 131 Pathirana J

observed that,

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the

court when an application for a writ or injunction is made and the process of the court is

invoked is laid down in the case of The King V. The General Commissioners for the

purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmond

de Poignac - (1917) Kings Bench Division 486. Although this case deals with a writ of

Prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In

this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the

rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material

to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that

there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and

therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of Prohibition without going into the merits of

the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of

all material facts that the court would not go into the merits of the application, but will

dismiss it without further examination."

In response to the argument raised with regard to the none compliance of Rules, the Respondent

relied on documents produced before this court lRl and lRl (a) and submitted that, the powers

of Divisional Heads and Managers conferred under the Rules have been delegated by way of a

Circular dated 31.07.2000 to several officers as far the categorization contained in the table

enclosed to the said circular.

As observed by this court the powers allocated by lRl and defined in lRl (a) limits to signing

of various types of documents with regard to disciplinary matters and the said circular is not in

conflict with the Disciplinary Rules before this court produced marked P-l.

According to lRl (a), signing of letters of interdiction with regard to 1-11/1 and 11 Grades had

been entrusted to the Deputy General Manager (Human Resource) who is the 3rd Respondent to

the present application.

As observed earlier, the Audit Department after its inquiry had produced its recommendations to

the 2nd Respondent who was the Acting General Manager of the 151 Respondent Bank, and the

said Respondent, being satisfied with the findings of the said report had decided to serve a

charge sheet on the Petitioner after interdicting her services. The said decision of the 2nd

Respondent was later submitted to the Board of Directors of the said Bank and was approved by

the Director Board.

The Respondent took up the position that it is the decision of the 2nd Respondent Acting General

Manager which was approved by the Board of Director of the 151 Respondent Bank and was

communicated to the Petitioner by the 3rd Respondent who is empowered to do so by the circular

lRl and lRl (a).

When considering the material discussed above I see no merit in the application before this court.

I therefore make order dismissing this application but make no order with regard to cost.

Application dismissed.
