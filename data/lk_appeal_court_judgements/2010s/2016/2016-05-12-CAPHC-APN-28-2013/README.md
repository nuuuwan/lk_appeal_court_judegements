This is a Revision Application against the Judgment of the learned

-4-

High Court Judge of Monaragala dated 17/01/2013, which affinned the

Order of the learned Magistrate of Well away a dated 29/09/2011 in Case No.

57700.

One Arawawatte Mudiyanselage Sudath Wickramasooriya, who was

the Accused in Case No. 57700, was charged in the Magistrate Court of

Wellawaya, for collecting sand which is a forest produce, from the Welioya

Forest which is a Conservation Forest, Reserve Forest or Village Forest

situated in the Thanamalwila Divisional Secretariat, committed an offence

under Section 20( 1)( d) of the Forest Ordinance No.13 of 1966 as amended

and thereby causing damage to the State in a sum of Rs.20001- which

offence is punishable under Section 40 and 40(a) read with Section 20 of the

Forest Ordinance No.13 of 1966 as amended.

The accused pleaded guilty to the aforesaid charge leveled against him

and accordingly the Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs.15,0001- on the

accused. Thereafter an inquiry was held regarding the confiscation of the

vehicle bearing Registration No. SG LD 5583 under Section 40 (a) of the

Forest Ordinance and at the end of the inquiry the learned Magistrate

confiscated the vehicle on the basis that the registered owner had not been

able to prove and satisfactorily convince that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence.

In this case the Claimant - Petitioner - Petitioner is the registered

owner of the vehicle. Being aggrieved by the said Order he moved the High

-5-

Court of Monaragala in revision of the aforesaid order, but the learned High

Court Judge by his Order dated 17/01/2013, dismissed the Petition of the

Petitioner affirming the learned Magistrate's Order dated 29.09.2011. Being

aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge the Petitioner

has filed the present Petition.

The learned Magistrate by his decision dated 29/09/2011 made Order

in terms of Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance confiscating the aforesaid

vehicle which bears the number SG LD 5583, that was used to commit the

said offence.

Aforesaid Section 40 in the Act No. 65 of 2009 reads thus:-

40( 1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence;

(a) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State

in respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used III

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by order of the convicting Magistrate.

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

-6-

of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case may be,

for the commission of the offence.

It is relevant to note by the use of the words "all precautions", the

legislature expects the registered owner to take each and every necessary

step / precaution to ensure that the vehicle is not being used to commit any

offence under the Forest Ordinance. Accordingly, when an application is

made to Court in order to have the vehicle released, it is the burden of the

owner of the vehicle, which was used to commit an offence under the Forest

Ordinance to establish that he had taken all necessary precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence.

In order to establish the aforesaid precautionary measures, the

Petitioner and one Wanasooriya Koralage Ravi Parakrama Danawardana, a

Junior Assistant Executive of the Commercial Bank, Balangoda have given

evidence before the learned Magistrate on behalf of the Petitioner. The

Petitioner in his evidence has stated that, the Accused driver usually takes

his lorry everyday in the morning from his house to let it for hires and

returns the vehicle in the evening. Further, the Petitioner has stated that he

had given special instructions not to perform any illegal activities. He has

also stated that on the 8th of June 2010 morning the Accused driver informed

him that there is a hire to transport some bricks and had sought his

permission to take the lorry and he allowed the Accused driver to take the

lorry.

-7-

It is significant to note that the Petitioner had not inquired from the

Accused driver, any details such as, the name of the hirer, the place from

which the bricks are to be transported and up to which point the bricks are to

be transported, the time period, the amount for the hire that was agreed

upon etc. Without asking any of these questions the Petitioner had just

allowed the Accused driver to take the lorry.

Further he has stated, in the afternoon the Petitioner was informed by

the Accused driver over the phone that his lorry was seized by the Forest

Officers of the Forest Conservation office of Thanamalwila. He has also

stated, he met the Forest Officers at the Forest Conservation Office to

inquire about the incident and he had been informed that the Accused driver

had transported sand without a permit and upon that charge the Accused

driver had been arrested with his lorry. Further he has stated that he

terminated the services of the Accused driver after he pleaded guilty to the

charge.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the learned

Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the evidence

of the Petitioner that he had taken every possible step to prevent the

committing of the offence in question. It is important to note that the

Petitioner has not stated even a single word, that he had taken as to the

necessary precautions, to prevent an offence being committed by using his

-8-

vehicle. The learned Counsel further submitted that the learned Magistrate

and the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the lorry had been

used for commission of the offence without the knowledge of the Petitioner.

In the oral and written submissions of the learned State Counsel it has

been stressed that the mere verbal claim in vague and uncertain terms by the

Petitioner that he had instructed the Accused driver specially not to perform

any illegal activity would cease to come within the requirements of Section

40(1) of the Forest Ordinance. Further submitted, that giving mere

instructions is not sufficient to discharge the said burden.

Is it sufficient for the owner merely to say that he was not aware or

that he had no knowledge that the vehicle was used in the commission of the

offence and instructions had been given to the Accused driver not to use the

vehicle for illegal purposes? The Answer to this question is purely in the

negative. The Petitioner cannot escape liability by stating that he was not

aware or he had no knowledge that the lorry was used in the commission of

the offence. He must show that he had taken all precautions available to

prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence. Giving

mere instructions or stating that the vehicle had been used for the

commission of the offence without his / her knowledge is not sufficient in

order to discharge the burden embodied in the proviso to Section (40) (1) of

the Forest (Amendment) Act.

-9-

In this regard I would like to refer to the following authorities:

Mary Matilda vs. Inspector of Police, Habarana C.A. Minutes

dated 08/07/2010 in C.A. (P.H.C) 86/97.

K.W.P.G. Samaratunga vs. Range Forest Officer, Anuradhapura

C.A. Minutes dated 16110/2014 in C.A. (P.H.C) 89/2013.

H.G. Sujith Priyantha Vs. Inspector of Police, Poddala C.A.

Minutes dated 19/02/2015 in C.A. (P.H.C.) 157/12.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner at the very outset of his

submissions referred to an earlier decision pronounced by me in respect of

the same issue. It is the case of CA (PHC) 03/2013 dated 25.07.2014.

According to the material and the facts found in that case, the Court has

decided that the claimant had no knowledge as to the commission of the

offence committed in that case. Thus the said decision is not directly

applicable in this case since the facts and circumstances of this case are quite

different to the facts in that other case.

The learned Magistrate having considered the evidence of the

Petitioner, has concluded that the Petitioner has failed to establish that he

has taken the necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed.

Learned High Court Judge too has accepted the reasoning of the learned

Magistrate and has affirmed the decision of the learned Magistrate.

-10-

When I consider the facts of this case and the evidence given by the

Petitioner, I am of the view that the Petitioner has not established on a

balance of probability that he had taken necessary precautions to prevent an

offence being committed by using his vehicle.

In the circumstances, I am of the view, that the learned Magistrate of

the Magistrate's Court Wellawaya and the learned High Court Judge of

Monaragala have taken into consideration both the facts and the law when

arriving at their respective orders and therefore I do not wish to disturb their

findings.

F or the above reasons I hold that there is no merit in this application

and accordingly this Petition is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree
