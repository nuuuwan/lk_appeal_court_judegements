The petitioners have filed this application praying for a Writ of

Mandamus directing the first to sixth and ninth to twelfth respondents to

give effect and implement the decision contained in document marked

4R4 (e).

4

The Western Provincial Council in September 2000 classified the

officers of the Sri Lanka Technical Service (SL TS) into two divisions

namely Buildings and Irrigation, and the cadre vacancies for the special

Grade the Western Province was 43 for buildings and 9 for irrigation.

This classification was challenged in the Court of Appeal and the

classification was set aside. Acting on the judgment of the Court of

Appeal the Western Provincial Council had taken measures to promote

the officers irrespectively of any speciality based on the list of seniority

in 2000. Promotions were given to 32 officers, 26 from the irrigation

division and 6 from the buildings division.

There was an appeal to the Supreme Court against the Court of

Appeal judgment, and by the Supreme Court judgment it was held that

the said categorization of the Sri Lanka Technical Service into two

divisions was lawful and an in accordance with the Sri Lanka Technical

Service minutes and reversed the said decision of the Court of Appeal.

By this time there were only 19 vacancies in the buildings division and in

the irrigation division, 17 were in excess.

The petitioners submitted that the document referred to as 4R4

(c) in the Supreme Court judgment is a copy of the minutes of a meeting

in the Western Provincial Council held to resolve the grievances and

5

issues faced by the officers in the Sri Lanka Technical Service which

included some of the petitioners.

The petitioners stated that they have suffered prejudice as a

result of the categorization and that they are eminently suitable for

promotions. The petitioners stated that the respondents failed to grant

promotions to special grade from Class I as directed by the Supreme

Court though they made representations to the respondents concerned.

The petitioners marked the letter they wrote to the respondents as well

as the replies in this regard as P7, P8, P9, P10 and P11. The petitioners

stated that since the respondents failed to give effect to these

undertakings in Rem the petitioners were compelled to institute this

action seeking a writ of Mandamus. The petitioners argued that they are

entitled to be promoted in terms of the Supreme Court judgment and in

terms of the undertaking in Rem contained in 4R4 (c). The petitioners

argued that these actions of the respondents created a legitimate

expectation in the minds of the petitioners in that, these due promotions

will be given. The petitioners cited the judgment in Karavita and others

and Welikanna vs Inspector General of Police and others 2002 (2)

SLR 287 and said that within the field of Public Law the scope of

Mandamus is still wide and the court may use it freely to prevent breach

of duty and injustice.

The petitioners further stated that the purported contention of the

respondents is untenable, in fact and in law.

The respondents stated that promotions can only be given if

cadre vacancies exist in the special Grade and according to the

requirements of each department as per Clause 5: 1 of the Sri Lanka

Technical Service minutes and since the petitioners belong to the

irrigation division there are no cadre vacancies since there are 17 extra

cadres promoted based on the Court of Appeal order. The respondents

further stated that promotions were given to all officers who were

adversely affected and who were in Class I on the date the decision to

categorize was to take effect which is 22/09/2000. Respondents further

stated that on their own documents marked P6 (a) to P6 (m) the

petitioners were promoted to Class I in the year 2003 which was back

dated to take effect from the years preceding 2000, thus on the material

time of granting promotions the petitioners were not in Class I therefore

could not entertain any expectations or have any right to be promoted to

the special grade.

The respondents further stated that the document marked 4R4 (c)

is not a decision but minutes of a meeting of the Western Provincial

Council which advise the Governor to promote all those who were in

7

j

j

!ItIl

Class I to the special Grade at the time the said advise was given which

is August 2000. The respondents referred to Clause 5 of 4R4 (c) which

they said clearly is not a decision but advise of the Board of Ministries to

the Governor.

The respondents further submitted that acting on the order of the

Court of Appeal they took measures to promote officers irrespective of

any categorization as a common cadres based on the list of seniority by

the year 2000. The report and recommendations of the interview board

and the list of seniority of the officers in both divisions are marked as

RX1, RX2 and RX3 which shows the material date taken for promotions

was 22nd September 2000. The respondents stated that at the material

time of granting promotions the petitioners were not in Class I thus could

not entertain any expectations or have any right to be promoted to the

special Grade.

The respondents argued that although the petitioners have written

letters to the respondents regarding their promotions and although the

respondents to the said letter, they have only stated that they have

taken action to promote persons based on the advice stated in

document 4R4 C and therefore there is no expectation that they will be

promoted as of right.

Citing the judgment in Perera vs National Housing Authority

2001 1 SLR 50 the respondents said that promotions are not a statutory

duty cast on the respondents and those promotions are done on merit

and also on circumstances.

The respondents further stated that the petitioners failed to name

the Board of Ministers of the Western Provincial Council who decided to

advice the Governor to make a decision to categorize, who are

necessary parties to this action. Citing the judgment in Farook vs

Siriwardena, Election Officer 1997 1 SLR 145 and

Ghanasambanthan vs Rear Admiral Perera 1983 2 SLR 169 said

failure to cite the necessary parties are fatal.

The respondents also stated the petitioners had an alternate

remedy by way of Fundamental rights application to the Supreme Court

if others were promoted above them.

On perusal of document 4R4 (c) which has been acknowledged in

the judgment in Supreme Court 7/2005 is merely minutes of a meeting

held on 02nd August 2000. Although decisions were taken to undertake

action these are the views and advice of the Chief Minister and not a

9

\

l I

decision approved by the Governor. In the Supreme Court judgment it

was held that the Governor has acted on the advice of the Board of

Ministers and the advice of the Board was held to be in documents

marked as 4R4 (a), 4R4 (b) and 4R4 (3) therefore the document 4R4 (c)

was not considered as a decision but advice of the Board of Ministers by

the Supreme Court.

As per their own documents the petitioners in the instant

application were promoted to Class I in the year 2003 therefore at the

material time of granting promotions they were not in Class I and they

could not have any expectation or have any right to be promoted to the

special Grade.

\

) !

The petitioners are well aware that all promotions now have been

given and that there are no cadre vacancies in either division. The

letters written to the respondents and the reply sent by the respondents

only states that they have taken action to promote persons based on the

advice given in 4R4 (c) and no where it is stated that the promotions are

to be given to the petitioners. Therefore there is no expectation arriving

from these documents.

10

The petitioners are not rightfully entitled to get promoted when

there are no vacancies. The foundation of Mandamus is the existence of

a right and Mandamus is not intended to create a right but to restore a

right which has been denied. In the instant application the petitioners

have not been denied their right to promotions the simple reason for not

getting the promotion is the lack of vacancies. The petitioners were not

in Class I when the categorization took place in 2000, to be promoted to

special Grade and those who were in Class I at that time were promoted

to the special Grade. Under these circumstances the petitioners could

not have legitimate expectations to be promoted to the special Grade.

The petitioners application is based on document 4R4 (c) but they

have failed to add the members of the Board as parties to this

application. This has been mentioned in the Supreme Court judgment.

F or the afore stated reason this court decides to refuse the

application of the petitioners.
