The Petitioner - Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted proceedings under the Case No. 44256, against the

Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

in the Magistrate's Court of Mount Lavinia under the Provisions of State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979. It was filed on

27.08.l999, seeking for an order from the Magistrate's Court to eject the

Appellant from the premises morefully described in the schedule to the

Application.

The Appellant appeared before the Magistrate's Court and filed

objections to the application. In his statement of objections he stated that he

is a lawful tenant of Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Council and

without terminating the said tenancy the Respondent has no power / right to

institute this action.

4

The matter was fixed for inquiry and on 26.03.2001, when it was

taken up for inquiry the Counsel for the Appellant raised a preliminary

objection with regard to the maintainability of the action that had not risen at

the time of filing the objections. It was the contention of the Appellant that,

as the Respondent is not the Competent Authority, he has no locus standi to

institute the action.

Having considered the submissions made by parties, the learned

Magistrate upheld the preliminary objection and dismissed the Respondent's

application.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the

Respondent filed a Revision Application dated 20.02.2002, that bears No.

34/2002, in the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo

seeking to revise the Order of the learned Magistrate. Having considered the

submissions made by parties, the learned High Court Judge set aside the

learned Magistrate's Order directing the learned Magistrate to hold an

inquiry and make an order according to law.

This appeal has been preferred against the aforesaid Order of the

learned High Court Judge.

The main ground urged by the Counsel for the Appellant in this

Appeal is, that in the impugned judgment the learned High Court Judge has

erred in law holding that the Respondent is the Commissioner of Local

Government (Competent Authority) as defined in Section 18 of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 07 of 1979. As such, the main

question to be determined is, whether the Respondent is the Competent

Authority as defined in Section 18 of the said Act.

5

When this Appeal was taken up for argument the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the Respondent adverted to the Section 9 of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act. It is the stance of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that the Sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the Act takes away from

the Magistrate the power to inquire into matters stated in the application,

under Section 5, except to inquire into the evidence of a valid permit.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General relied on the following decided

cases to support his case more.

(i) Farook vs. Gunawardana, Government Agent Ampara (1980) 2

SLR 243;

(ii) Muhandiram vs. Chairman, lanatha Estate Development Board

(1992) 1 SLR 110;

(iii) Nimal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd; vs Sri Lanka Ports Authority

and Another;

(iv) Keenigama vs Dixon CA No. 116/95; CA Mts. 22/02/2002.

Section 9 of the Act reads as follows:

9 (1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under Section 6

has been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters

stated in the application under Section 5 except that such person may

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon valid

permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any other written law and that such permit or authority is in force

and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

6

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of the application

under Section 5.

A simple reading of the Section shows, that the validity of the matters

stated in the application cannot be questioned, challenged or contested

except the matters mentioned in Section 9 (1).

In the premises aforesaid I have no difficulty In upholding the

contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General.

However, without prejudice to the above view, the next matter to be

considered is whether the Respondent could be identified as a "Competent

Authority" for the purpose of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act

No.7 of 1979.

It is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that, the

Commissioner of Local Government referred to in Section 18 of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act. No. 07 of 1979, is the Commissioner of

Local Government of the Central Government.

In the written submission filed in this Court by the learned Counsel

for the Appellant, it was contended that a Commissioner of Local

Government of a Province does not fall within the meaning of "Competent

Authority" as defined in Section 18 of the said Act. It was further contended

that, as the proceedings have not been instituted by the Commissioner of

Local Government of the Central Government, the Respondent did not have

the locus standi to institute the said action in the Magistrate's Court under

the Provisions of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act.

7

Section 18 of the Act defines the "Competent Authority" as follows:

(18) "Competent Authority" used in relation to any land means the

Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant

Government Agent of the district in which the land is situated and,

includes;

(i) the Commissioner of Local Government, where such land is

under the control of a local authority;

The "local authority" is defined in the same section. It reads as

follows:

"local authority" means any Municipal Council, Urban Council, Town

Councilor Village Council and includes any Authority created and

established by or under any law to exercise, perform and discharge

powers, duties and functions corresponding to or similar to the

powers, duties and functions exercised, performed and discharged by

any such Council".

Simple reading of the Section 18 and the aforesaid definition clearly

shows, that the Respondent has the power to take steps as the Competent

Authority in terms of State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Hence, I hold that there is no merit whatsoever in the submissions

made by the learned Counsel for the Appellant. His argument is untenable

in view of the definition given to the words "Competent Authority" by the

State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act.

On perusal of the Judgment it is apparent, that the learned High Court

Judge has taken into consideration the submissions filed by the parties and

8

has come to a conclusion. As such, I do not see any wrong in the manner in

which the learned High Court Judge has considered the facts and the way in

which he has applied the law in this instance.

For the above reasons, I see no basis to interfere in the Judgment of

the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly I affirm the Judgment dated

03.08.2006 and dismiss the Appeal with costs.
