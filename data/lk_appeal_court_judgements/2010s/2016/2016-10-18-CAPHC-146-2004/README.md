L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The Petitioner Appellant was an employee of the 1 st Respondent

Cooperative Society. After an arbitral inquiry held by the 3rd Respondent,

she was called upon to pay Rs. 465501.75 on account of cash shortage

during her service as a manager in the said Society. Being aggrieved by

the said award, she appealed to the 4th Respondent who is the Registrar of

the Cooperative Societies Southern Province under section 58(3) of the

Cooperative Societies Law No.5 of 1972. The 4th Respondent rejected

the appeal on the ground that the Appellant has failed to comply with the

pre requisite of depositing the 10% of the award sum to accept the appeal.

The appellant instituted an action in the Provincial High Court of

Southern Provision at Matara seeking a mandates in the nature of a writs

of certiorari to quash the award granted by the 3 rd Respondent and to

quash the decision rejecting the appeal by the 4th Respondent. The learned

High Court Judge, after inquiry, dismissed the application. This appeal is

from the said order of dismissal.

At the argument both parties agreed that this matter be disposed by

way of written submissions since the issue is only a question of law. The

question is whether it is mandatory for the 4th Respondent to reject the

appeal in a case where the appellant has failed to deposit the appeal

3

deposit of 10% of the award sum with the 4th Respondent under Rule 49

(xii) (a) of the Cooperative Society Regulations of 1973. It is a common

fact that the Appellant has not deposited the appeal deposit.

The Cooperative Society Regulations of 1973(hereinafter sometime

called as Rules) were made pursuant to section 61 Of the Cooperative

Societies Law. The minister is empowered to make regulations under this

section. The section reads;

61. (1) The Minister may make all such rules as may be necessary for

the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the principles

and provisions of this Law.

(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the

powers conferred by subsection (1), such rules may-

(a) to (x) not relevant to this case

(y) prescribe the forms to be used, the fees to be paid, the

procedure to be observed, and all other matters

connected with or incidental to the presentation, hearing

and disposal of appeals under this Law or the rules

made thereunder.

(3) No rule shall have effect unless it has been approved by

Parliament. Notification of such approval shall be published in

the Gazette.

(4) Every rule shall, upon the publication in ,the Gazette of the

Notification referred to in subsection (3), be as valid and

effectual as though it were herein enacted.

The Rules were published in the Gazette Extra Ordinary No. 93/5

dated 10th January 1974. The Gazette says that the rules have been

approved by the National State Assembly (the Parliament was named as

4

the National State Assembly under Constitution promulgated in 1972) on

the 20th November 1973. Under section 61(4) of the Cooperative

Societies Law the rules are valid and effectual as they were enacted in the

said law.

The Rule 49 (xii) (a) of the said Rules provides the procedure for

appeal. The Rule 49 (xii) reads;

(a) Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of an arbitrator or

panel of arbitrators shall be made within 30 days from the date

of the award by a written statement setting out the grounds of

appeal. Every such appeal shall be forwarded to the Registrar

with an appeal deposit of Rs.50 or 10% of the sum awarded

where the appeal is made by the party against whom the award

has been made and Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum claimed in the

dispute where the appeal is made by a party claiming any sum

of money, whichever sum is the higher sum in either case.

(b)An appeal not made in conformity with the above shall be

rejected by the Registrar.

(c) & (d) not relevant at this stage.

This Rule has made it mandatory for the party appealing against

the award to deposit the appeal deposit. The words used in the Rule are

"Every such appeal shall be forwarded to the Registrar with an appeal

deposit ..... ". The appeal deposit is a compulsory pre requisite. The Rule

(b) stipulates the result of non compliance of the rule (a). Under this Rule,

the Registrar has no option but to reject the appeal if the Rule (a) is not

complied with. The words "shall be forwarded" used in Rule (a) have

been given a solid meaning by providing the compulsory rejection of

appeal for non compliance in Rule (b). The appeal deposit is a mandatory

pre requisite to entertain an appeal by the Registrar.

The Counsel for the Respondent has submitted that it had been held

in the unreported case of CA Application 889/2000 dated 12.02.2014 that

the appeal deposit is mandatory, but not tendered a readable copy of the

judgment.

The Counsel for the Appellant relied on the case of Sebastian

Fernando v. Katana M.P.C.S. Ltd. and others [1990] 1 Sri L R 342. The

issue in this case was the rejection of the application for a writ without

issuing notice. In this case Fernando J. held at page 345 that;

Although the Court has a discretion, In appropriate

circumstances, to refuse Certiorari and Mandamus on the ground

of delay, that plea involves equitable considerations ; the conduct

of both parties should have been taken into account, and it was

relevant that there was a delay of 18 months on the part of the

Registrar in informing the Appellant of the rejection of his appeal,

as well as a failure to reply to the Appellant's subsequent letters;

the fact that no steps were taken to enforce the award might in

these circumstances have led the Appellant to believe that such

steps would not be taken; that such delay caused no prejudice to

other parties. Further, if the Appellant's contention is right, the

rejection of his appeal would have been patently erroneous and

without jurisdiction. In those circumstances, delay would not have

justified summary dismissal (Rajakaruna v. Minister of Finance (1)

; Biso Menike v. de Alwis (2) ; Ramasamy v. State Mortgage Bank

(3) ; the Respondents should have been noticed, and had delay

been pleaded the Appellant may have been able to furnish other

explanatory material.

Their Lordships have discussed the vires of the Rule 49 (xii) and

observed that there is a serious question to be decided in the Court of

6

Appeal and the case has been remitted to the Court of Appeal. Their

Lordships have not held that the Rule 49 (xii) is ultra vires. In the present

case the Appellant is not challenging the Rule 49(xii) on the basis of ultra

vires. Therefore Sebastian Fernando case has no application to this case.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal without cost.

P.R.Walgama J.

I agree.
