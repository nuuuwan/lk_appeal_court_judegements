JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Document marked and produced by the Petitioner P 1 in this proceeding is

a permit issued in terms of section 19 (2) of the Land Development

Ordinance (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Ordinance) to

Bisomanike Rajapaksha who is the mother of both the Petitioner and the

II IIIII;

4th Respondent. Said Bisomanike Rajapaksha had nominated R P D Sarath

Wijerathne who is one of her sons, as her successor.

After the demise of both the original permit holder Bisomanike Rajapaksha

and the successor nominated by her in the permit namely, R P D

Wijerathne, the Petitioner's name was entered on 2008-08-28 as the

successor on the basis that he is entitled to succeed according to law, as

he is the eldest surviving son.

The above facts pertaining to this case mentioned up to this point are not

disputed by the parties. Hence, it is both appropriate and convenient to

proceed in the rest of this judgment on the basis that the Petitioner is the

current lawful permit holder of the permit marked P 1.

What is being contested, in this proceeding is an order marked P 9

cancelling this permit by the 2nd Respondent and the decision dated 2013-

03-05 marked P 11 which is the decision of the 3rd Respondent pertaining

to the consideration of the appeal (against P 9 ) lodged by the Petitioner.

Since what is being contested is an act of cancellation of a permit it would

be necessary to examine the provisions dealing with this aspect in the Land

Development Ordinance.

According to section 106 of the Ordinance, if it appears to the Government

Agent that a permit holder has failed to observe a condition of the permit,

he may issue a notice in the prescribed form intimating to such permit

holder that his permit will be cancelled unless sufficient cause to the

contra ry is shown.

5

The procedure to be followed when such permit holder appears and offers

to show cause is laid down in section 110 which is as follows.

section 110

(1) If on the date and at the time and place specified in a notice issued

under section 106 or appointed by the Government Agent under section

109 (2) the permit-holder appears and offers to show cause why his permit

should not be cancelled, the Government Agent may, if he is satisfied after

inquiry that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the permit,

make order cancelling the permit.

(2) The Government Agent may adjourn any inquiry under this section

from time to time and shall hear evidence before making his order.

All such evidence shall be given on oath or affirmation which the

Government Agent is hereby authorized to administer for the purpose.

(3) Where an inquiry under this section is adjourned, notice in writing of

the date and the time to which the inquiry is adjourned shall be given by

the Government Agent to the permit-holder.

The 1st notice sent by the 2nd Respondent is the document marked P 3.

According to that notice, the 2nd Respondent has alleged that the

Petitioner has breached the conditions mentioned in the permit. It includes

the followi ng ph rases :

6

" ............ CYWt)) e.5etwZ5f cr)m6 a~ed' e7J5)JZ5fe~8 ~~t))J ~8Z5f 0'~ awZ

~1~e)Z5) crZ5f~@Z5f eZ5)J8gal~ :5)e@Z5) @leJ ea~ G3C6 @1~Z5f ...... "

The 2nd Respondent in the notice marked P 3 has informed the Petitioner

to appear before him and satisfy him as to why he should not cancel the

Petitioner's permit. This notice is dated 2009-08-19.

Subsequent to the said notice, the 2nd Respondent by the letter dated

2009-11-18 (marked as P 4) has informed both the Petitioner and the 4th

Respondent that he has decided to grant 2 permits to both of them for

separate portions of the same land. The 2nd Respondent has further

requested both the Petitioner and the 4h Respondent by that letter to

come to an agreement and decide about the portions to be allotted to each

of them.

It must be noted that the above inquiry was held to decide whether the

permit should be cancelled or not, and the decision taken at the end, turns

out to be a decision to subdivide the land.

Despite this decision, 2nd Respondent has again sent to the Petitioner, a

2nd notice dated 2012-09-26 (P 7) asking him to show cause as to why his

..

permit should not be cancelled. In that notice also, the wordings are

exactly similar to the previous notice (P 3 ). It is as follows.

" ............ ~w2S) eeetwzrl qe)ee6 a~G'd G'2mJzrlG'ci@ ~&I2S)J 5@zrl G't8 aw2S)

~lzsfG'8Z5) qzrl ~@zrl G'Z5)J8~al~ :5)G'@Z5) @le) G'a~ c.5Z5) @15zrl ...... "

It is to be noted that the wordings of both the above letters (P 3 & P 4)

are the same except the underlined word.

The Petitioner was asked to be present for the inquiry referred to in the

letter P 4 before the 2nd Respondent on 2012-11-14. It is the contention of

the Petitioner that he submitted his reasons against cancellation of the

permit by the document marked P 8.

The following causes namely,

i. that he had to keep away from the land due to the threats from the

4th Respondent

ii. that he has lodged a complaint in this regard at the Police station,

Anuradhapura on 2009-11-26

8

iii. that he has instituted a case in the District court of Anuradhapura

bearing number L 23439 to have the trespasser (4th Respondent)

evicted.

iv. that the allegation that the land has not been developed is factually

wrong as he has not only made constructions in the land but also has

cultivated and that he had properly entrenched the land with fences.

v. that he has at no stage alienated this property to the person who is

said to occupy the land at present but he is a person who had

resided even at the time he was named as the successor to this

permit.

Subsequent to this inquiry the 2nd Respondent has by the document

marked P 9 ordered the cancellation of the said permit. The said order

contains inter alia the following phrases:

It must be again noted that even here the wordings appearing at the

bottom of the document are same as before.

First of the main contentions relied upon by the learned counsel for the

Petitioner is that the 2nd Respondent has failed to hold a proper inquiry as

envisaged by section 110 of the Ordinance before he decided to cancel the

permit.

The position taken up by the 2nd Respondent, is as follows.

i. an inquiry under section 106 of the Land Development Ordinance for

which the parties were notified by the document marked P 3 was not

held.

ii. the inquiry which was conducted on 2009-11-18 was not an inquiry

under the Section 106 of the Land Development Ordinance and it

was just an informal "office inquiry" conducted by the 2nd

Respondent;

t

f

l

rI t!It' , IIIIII

iii. the decision of the said inquiry was issued on the same date as a

kind of settlement, which is marked as P 4, and is not a decision or

notice under section 109 of the Land Development Ordinance;

iv. the said document itself shows that, to execute the said decision, the

consent of the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent was required by the

2nd Respondent;

v. the said decision did not come into force since the parties did not

respond to the said document P 4.

It is relevant to note that the 2nd Respondent's position is that he gave the

impugned decision (P 9) based on the material made available to him by

Grama Niladhari, land Officer and the Petitioner (Paragraph 15 (Vii) of his

affidavit). The 2nd Respondent has admitted receiving the document

marked (P 8). It contains the reasons adduced by the Petitioner addressed

to the 2nd Respondent urging him not to cancel the Petitioner's permit. The

said document P 8 is dated 2012-11-14. Thus at its least, those reasons

adduced by the Petitioner through P 8 should have been considered by the

2nd Respondent, in the inquiry which is said to have been held. However

not a word, at least indicative of the fact that such reasons were

considered, is to be found in his decision P 9. As shown before his decision

is not more than a repetition of the same paragraph that appeared in the

notice (f..7) summoning the Petitioner for the inquiry.

By virtue of section 110 of the Ordinance it becomes incumbent upon the

2nd Respondent to consider intently the material that would be adduced by

those who are concerned in the matter. A specific procedure in that regard

11

has been set out in the Ordinance. There is no material or basis for this

Court to conclude that the 2nd Respondent has complied with that

procedure. Thus the contention of the Petitioner that the 2nd Respondent

has failed to conduct an inquiry in terms of section 110, has to be upheld.

The Petitioner being aggrieved with the said cancellation order has

preferred an appeal to the 3rd Respondent. The appeal he has lodged is

marked and produced as P 10.

The decision of the 3rd Respondent with regard to the said appeal is the

document marked P 11.

The second of the two main contentions relied upon by the learned counsel

for the Petitioner is that the 3rd Respondent has failed to observe the rules

of natural justice when he decided the appeal preferred by the Petitioner,

against the 2nd Respondent's decision.

In terms of section 113 of the Ordinance a permit-holder aggrieved by an

order made by the Government Agent under section 110 may appeal there

from to the Land Commissioner. Section 114 of the Ordinance sets out a

time limit of forty-two days for lodging such an app~al.

Section 115 of the Ordinance sets out the Powers that could be exercised

by the Land Commissioner in such an appeal.

According to that section, the Land Commissioner may in appeal

a) direct further inquiry to be made or information to be furnished

or evidence to be given; or

I

12

b) allow the appeal and set aside the order of the Government

Agent; or

c) modify the order of the Government Agent; or

d) affirm the order of the Government Agent; or

e) make such other order as he may consider just.

The 3rd Respondent, in his affidavit filed before this Court has admitted

I. that the Petitioner has lodged the appeal (P 3)

II. that he gave the decision (f..11) after perusing the available

documents pertaining to the case.

He however does not deny the complaint against him, made by the

Petitioner that he had not afforded an opportunity for the Petitioner

to be heard before he decided this appeal. What section 113 of the

Ordinance has given to an aggrieved party is a right to appeal.

Section 115 of the Ordinance has specifically given wide powers to

the Land Commissioner which he is empowered to exercise to correct

any injustice that could be caused at the hands of the Government

Agent. This Court has concluded that the 2nd Respondent has failed

to follow the procedure set out in law, when he arrived at his . . decision to cancel the permit of the Petitioner. Even at the hands of

the appellate authority the Petitioner has not been afforded an

opportunity to explain the injustice that was caused to him. Thus the

second contention of the Petitioner is also entitled to succeed.

I I

13

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, we issue

1) a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision by the 2nd Respondent

(marked P 9) cancelling this permit and

2) the decision dated 2013-03-05 marked P 11 which is the decision

of the 3rd Respondent pertaining to the consideration of the appeal

(against P 9 ) lodged by the Petitioner.

No cost is ordered.

Application is allowed.
