The Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Appellant) has preferred this Appeal to impugn the Order of the learned

High Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 27.06.2007, wherein the learned

High Court Judge had dismissed the Petition filed by the Appellant.

The facts that have given rise to the present application are briefly as

follows:

3

A.M. Somapala and W. Manjula Prasad, who were the accused in

Case No. 33179, were charged in the Magistrate's Court of Embilipitiya on

two charges under the Animal Act. They pleaded guilty to the charges and a

date was fixed for inquiry regarding the vehicle.

The Appellant was absent on inquiry dates 04.05.2006, 08.06.2006,

14.09.2006,02.11.2006 and 22.03.2007. Accordingly, warrants also had

been issued on him.

When the case was taken up for inquiry on 22.03.2007, the Appellant

was absent and unrepresented. As such, the learned Magistrate had

confiscated the vehicle and ordered the Officer in Charge of Kolonna Police

Station to retrieve the vehicle, since the vehicle had been released by the

learned Magistrate to the Appellant on a bond before the inquiry.

Being aggrieved by the said Order made by the learned Magistrate,

the Appellant moved the High Court of Embilipitiya in revision of the

aforesaid Order; but the learned High Court Judge by her Order dated

27.06.2007, dismissed the Petition due to lack of exceptional circumstances.

Being aggrieved by the said Order the Appellant has preferred this Appeal to

this Court praying for the annulling of the said Order.

The Appeal was scheduled for argument on 19.10.2015. Only the

Respondent was present in Court and the Appellant was absent and

unrepresented although notices had been issued on him several times.

Accordingly, the submissions were made on behalf of the Respondent only.

4

Under Section 349 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, if the

Appellant does not appear to support the Appeal, the Court shall consider the

Appeal and make an order therein as it may deem fit.

Accordingly, I will now consider the merits of the Appeal.

The Appellant by this Appeal has challenged the Order of the learned

High Court Judge of Embilipitiya made on 27.06.2007.

On a perusal of the Order made by the learned High Court Judge, it

appears that the reason given by her to dismiss the Petition is, that the

Appellant had failed to plead any exceptional circumstances that are

necessary for the invocation of the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Court,

which is a discretionary remedy.

The Revisionary power of the Court is a discretionary power and its

exercise cannot be demanded as a right unlike the statutory remedy of

appeal. Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

Court should select the cases in respect of which the extraordinary power of

revision should be adopted.

In Dharmarathna and Another vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. (2003)

3 S.L.R. 24, Gamini Amaratunga J. stated that the practice of Court to insist

on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary

powers has taken deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule

which should not be lightly disturbed. The trend of authorities clearly

indicates that the revisionary powers of the Court will be exercised if the

exceptional circumstances exist only.

5

It is abundantly clear that the Appellant had not specifically pleaded

such exceptional circumstances in the body of the Petition other than that he

is dissatisfied with the Order of the learned Magistrate. I am of the view that

it cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance.

F or the reasons set out above I hold that the learned High Court

Judge's Order for dismissing the Petition is correct and as such there is no

reason to set aside the said Order. Therefore it is not necessary to interfere

with the Order of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly no ground

exists which justifies the intervention of this Court to set aside the Order of

the learned High Court Judge.

Without prejudice to the aforesaid decision it is relevant to note the

conduct of the Appellant. The Appellant had repeatedly failed to appear

before this Court in support of his appeal. It is significant to note that he had

failed to appear before the Magistrate's Court too to face the inquiry. It is

important to note that in the Revision Application filed in the High Court by

the Appellant he has stated (Para 4) that he was unable to appear in the

Magistrate's Court on 22.03.2007 due to the fact that he had mistaken the

date. This was the date the learned Magistrate had ordered the confiscation

of the vehicle.

It is significant to note that in the Petition of Appeal filed he has stated

(Para 3) that due to floods in his area he was unable to appear on the due

date and that his Counsel had informed the Court of his absence. It clearly

shows that he has contradicted his position in the Petition of Appeal.

On perusal of the Journal Entries in the Magistrate's Courts as per

Journal Entry dated 02.11.2006, it is clear that the Appellant's Counsel had

6

infonned Court that the Appellant was unable to appear in Court due to

floods in his area on 02.11.2006 and not on 22.03.2007.

It is clear therefore, that the learned Magistrate's Order to confiscate

the vehicle was made on 22.03.2007 and not on 02.11.2006. It is also

important to note that after 02.11.2006 the Appellant had appeared in Court

on 23.11.2006 and 07.12.2006. Since the inquiry was not held on

07.12.2006 it had been postponed to 22.03.2007 on which date the Appellant

was absent, and since he was absent and unrepresented the learned

Magistrate has ordered to confiscate the vehicle.

In the circumstances outlined above it is abundantly clear that the

Appellant has tried to mislead the Court and given false reasons for his non-

appearance on the due date which the inquiry was held. Hence, the

Appellant has tendered a false Affidavit along with the Petition to the High

Court with regard to his non-appearance in the Magistrate's Court.

It is important to note, that the Appellant has not come with clean

hands to this Court. Be that as it may, he has failed to appear before this

Court to pursue his own application. In the Magistrate's Court too he had

not made any attempt to place any evidence to disclose the burden placed on

him by law. Since the Appellant had failed to discharge the burden the

learned Magistrate had made an order to confiscate the vehicle.

In the above circumstances, it is my considered view, that the learned

Magistrate was correct, when the Order was made to confiscate the vehicle;

as such there is no reason to set aside the Order made by the learned

Magistrate.

For the above reasons, I hold that there is no merit in the Appeal and I

dismiss it.
