L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The Complainant Respondent Appellant (the Appellant) as the

competent authority under Food Act, instituted action against the 1 st

Accused Respondent in the Magistrate Court, Udugama for violating the

Food Act. The 1 st Accused pleaded guilty to the charge. The 2nd Accused

Petitioner Respondent pleaded not guilty through an authorized officer and

on the order of the Court, the Directors of the 2nd Accused were brought in

as 2, 3, 4 accused. The 2nd Accused moved to discharge the accused since

the Government Analyst has withdrawn the 1 st adverse report and submitted

a 2nd report which is not an adverse report. The learned Magistrate refused

the application. The Accused Petitioner Respondents moved in revision in

the High Court of Galle where the learned High Court Judge acquitted the

Accused on the basis that the Magistrate cannot frame a charge against the

Accused because of the 2nd report of the Government Analyst. The learned

High Court Judge has further observed that the Appellant being a public

officer, who has acted in the official, capacity of a public officer, has no

3

right to retain a private lawyer in an appeal. The Appellant being aggrieved

by the said judgment of the High Court, appealed to this Court.

At the argument, the Accused Petitioner Respondents (the

Respondents) raised two preliminary objections to the maintainability of this

appeal. The one of the said objections is that the appeal is time bared, but in

the written submissions the Respondents submitted that they do not pursue

the said objection. The other objection is that the Appellant had failed to

tender a certificate by an Attorney at Law that the questions of law urged in

the petition of appeal were fit questions for adjudication by the Court of

Appeal, and thereby failed to comply with Rule 4(2) of the Court of Appeal

(Procedure for appeals from High Courts established by Article 154P of the

Constitution) Rules, 1988.

The said Rule 4(2) reads thus;

Where the appeal is on a matter of law the petition shall contain a

statement of the matter of law to be argued and shall bear a

certificate by an Attorney at Law that such matter of law is a fit

question for adjudication by the Court of Appeal.

It is common ground that the petition does not contain such a

statement, with a certificate of an Attorney at Law. The appellant's

contention is that the petition is signed by an Attorney at Law and it is not

necessary to include a separate certificate. The Respondents argue that the

mandatory provisions of the Rules have to be complied with and the non

compliance is fatal.

The grounds of appeal are stated in the paragraph 18 of the petition of

appeal. All the grounds stated therein are matters of law. The legality of the

order of the learned High Court Judge, the necessity for the Attorney

General to represent the Appellant, whether the Respondents are estopped

from challenging the right to be represented by a private lawyer, the effect

of Government Analyst's withdrawal of the 1st report, are the grounds of

III

4

appeal stated in the petition. All these are matters of law that has to be

considered in this appeal. As such, the Rule 4(2) directly applies to the

present petition.

There is a long line of authorities decided by the Superior Courts that

the non compliance of the Rules is fatal. In a recent case, R.A.Ranasinghe v

A.G. CA/PHC185/2011 CA Minutes dated 05.08.2015 Malini Gunarathene

J. with my sister Rohini Walgama J. agreeing considered the long line of

authorities on the issue of non compliance of the Rules and held;

It has been held over and over again by this Court as well as

the Supreme Court; non-compliance with the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules is fatal to the application. The

importance and the mandatory nature of the observance of the Rules

of the Court of Appeal in presenting an application has been

repeatedly emphasized, and discussed in a long line of decided

authorities by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

In the case of Coomasaru vs. Mis Leechman and Co. Ltd., and

Three Others, Tennekoon, c.J. stated as follows:

"Rules of Procedure must not always be regarded as mere

technicalities which parties can ignore at their whim and pleasure".

In that case, the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the

Respondent that relates to the non compliance oj Rules upheld and

dismissed the case.

It was held in Nicholas vs. Macan Marker Ltd; (1981) 2 SLR 1,

noncompliance with the Rule which is in imperative terms would

render such application liable to be rejected.

Justice Soza stated in Navarathnasingham vs. Arumugam and

Another (J 980) 2 SLR 1 "This Petition therefore should have been

r ! I I 1 ! i I I ,

! I I

5

rejected for non-compliance with Rules. Further he stated that the

Supreme Court Rules are imperative and should be complied with.

Same decision was followed in the case of Rasheed Ali vs.

Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29.

In the case of Koralage vs. Marikkar Mohamed and others

(1988) 2 SLR 299, it was held, compliance of the Rules is a

mandatory requirement and non-compliance is a material defect in

the application and cannot maintain the application.

Same decision was followed in cases Brown and Company Ltd.

V s. Rathnayake (1990) 1 SLR 92, The Attorney General vs. Wilson

Silva (1992) 1 SLR 44 and Balasingham and Another vs.

Puvanthiram (2000) 1 SLR 163. It was stated by Perera J. in

Balasingham case, failure to comply with Rules is indeed a failure to

show due diligence. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. In the

cases of Facy vs. Sanoon and Others (2003) 2 SLR, and Jeganathan

vs. Sajyath (2003) 2 SLR 372 same decision has beenfollowed.

It was held in Shanmugadivu vs. Kulatilake (2003) 1 SLR 215,

the requirements of Rules are imperative and the Court of Appeal had

no discretion to excuse the failure to comply with the Rules.

Hence, the weight of authorities mentioned above, thus favours

the view, that non-compliance with the Rules is fatal to the

application. Parties who invoke the jurisdiction of the Court cannot

ignore the Rules and then ask to be heard.

It is to the best interest of the administration of Justice that

Judges shall not ignore or deviate from the procedural law and

decide matters on equity and justice as Dr. Amarasinghe J. pointed

out in the case of Fernando vs. Sybil Fernando and Others (1997) 3

SLR 12 ............. .

6

Dr. Amarasinghe J pointed out in the case of Fernando vs.

Sybil Fernando "there is the substantive law and the procedural law.

Procedural law is not secondary. The two branches are

complementary. Halsbury points out it is by procedure that the law

which puts life into substantive law, gives it remedy and effectiveness

and brings it into being".

Hence, in the interests of the administration of justice, there

must be order, and therefore there must be compliance with the Rules

of the Court of Appeal. As I have observed the defect was not of a

purely formal or technical nature. Invoking the jurisdiction of the

court is a crucial step in the proceedings.

In the present case the Appellant has failed to comply with the Rule

4(2). It is mandatory to contain a certificate from an Attorney At Law to the

effect that the questions of law raised in the petition are matters fit for

adjudication by the Court of Appeal. Since the petition is signed by an

Attorney at Law, at least there should be an averment/pleading in the

petition to that effect. Without such a statement in the petition the appeal

cannot be maintained.

I uphold the preliminary objection. The appeal is dismissed.
