against the order delivered on 25.05.2005 by the learned District Judge of

Ratnapura, and the facts and circumstances which have given rise to this

application are briefly as follows:

The Plaintiff instituted the present action by his plaint on 02.09.2004

against the Defendant in the District Court of Ratnapura, seeking inter alia a

declaration that gem stone prospected by the Plaintiff was taken into custody

by the Defendant is unlawful, for an Order of Court compelling the Defendant to

handover the said gemstones to the Petitioner or in case of disposal the Plaintiff

be paid the value of the gemstones and for an interim injunction and an

enjoining order restraining the Defendant from handing over the said

gemstones to any other third party until the conclusion of the action.

The Plaintiff has averred in his Plaint that he is the owner of the land

morefully described in the schedule to the plaint and he obtained a license from

the Defendant to prosper gemstones on the said land. During the course of the

said gemming operation certain Rohana de Silva disputed the title to the land

with the Plaintiff. As a result the license issued to the Plaintiff was revoked by

the Defendant on 21.3.2001, after an inquiry.

During the course of the inquiry on 22.01.2001, certain gemstones

prospected by the Plaintiff on the said land. Thereafter a person named Sri

Bakmeedeniya also made a claim to the land on which the Plaintiff carried out

gemming operation and applied for a license prospecting for gem stones. After

the inquiry the Defendant by his letter dated 08.07.2003 which was marked as

IIp2" and annexed with the Plaint informed the Plaintiff that the land in

question is being called 'ellewatte Ihalakella' as alleged by the said Sri

3

8akmeedeniya and if the Plaintiff failed to obtain from a competent court a

declaration of title to the said land, a license would be issued to the said Sri

8akmeedeniya to prospect for gemstones, well knowing foregoing the Plaintiff

did not prove the legal actions to assert his title to the land in dispute on which

gemming operation was carried out by the Plaintiff.

Instead of ascertaining his title to the land in dispute the Plaintiff has

invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court by way of filing plaint averring the

pleadings for an interim injunction as abovementioned.

The Defendant has filed his objections stating that the Plaintiff ought to

have resorted the judicial review from the High Court rather than filing this

action and that the Plaintiff failed to obtain a declaratory Order regarding title

to the Plaintiff to the land namely, 8andaragodella even after seizure of the

gemstones. The outcome of the inquiry held by the Defendant revealed that the

Plaintiff having obtained license to prospect for gemstones on the land of

8andaragodella has instead done mining operation on the land of 'ellewatte

Ihalakella' and secured the said gemstones therefrom and committed laches in

bringing the present action in the District Court.

The learned District Judge, having examined the documents and perused

the written submissions filed by both parties has delivered his Order on

25.02.2001, refusing the application of the Plaintiff for interim injunction.

The Counsel s for both parties filed their written submissions in this Court

in that the counsel for the Plaintiff raised objections, that the Defendant filed

his objection without an affidavit in support of the averments contained thereof

and the Plaintiff has proved primafacie case against the Defendant and the

r

balance of convenience clearly lies in favour of the Plaintiff and therefore Leave

to Appeal be granted and to set aside the order of the District Judge of

Ratnapura dated 25.02.2005.

Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff has committed

laches in bringing this action and failed to establish prima facie case before the

learned District Judge and the '11"ain contention of the Plaintiff is that he has

proved a prima facie case and the balance of convenience as required for the

issue of interim injunction before the learned District Judge. It is trite law that

the party who seeks relief of injunction must establish certain requirements as

Justice Zosa stated in Felix Dias Bandaranayake - 1981 2 SLR 287, that prima

facie, case balance of convenience is in favour of a party applying for the

injunction and the conduct and dealings of the parties to be considered as it is

equitable remedy.

Prima facie case means that a person seeking interim injunction must

show that his legal right has been infringed and that he will probably succeed in

establishing his right as stated by Thambiah J., in Subramaniam vs Sahabdeen -

1984 1 SLR 48-54, that the Plaintiff must establish that there is probability that

he is entitled for relief prayed by him.

In Amarasekera vs Mitsui Co. Ltd and others -1993 1 SLR 22, Amerasinghe

J., held:

lithe learned District Judge should have been satisfied that the

prima facie claim and reasonable prospect of success even in the light of

the defences raised in the pleadings, objections and submissions of the

Defendant. The present case is a declaratory action. Thus it is an

~. 1/ 5

/

implication under the relevant provisions of National Gem & Jewellery

Authority Act No. 50 of 1993, the Plaintiff must prove his title to the land

in which mining operation being done by him in case of seizure or

forfeiture of gemstones."

It is clear that immediately after the seizure of the gem stones prospected

by the Defendant fairly and prudently advised the Plaintiff to file an action to

vindicate his title to the land which is a sine qua non for the equitable relief of

injunction. This observation could be seen in Karunadasa Rajapakse vs Podi

Appuhamy 1989 1 SlR ..... and Dingiri Mahathmaya and others - 2003 2 SlR

268.

Balance of convenience means factors of uncompensationable

disadvantage or irreparable damage to either party that once the prima facie

case is made out then the Court would consider whether the balance of

convenience lies on the Plaintiff who seeks injunction held by Justice Soza in the

case of Felix Dias Bandaranayake - Dingiri Mahatmaya and others 2003 2 SlR is

as follows:

I{ By weighing the injury which the Defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted and he should ultimately turn out to be the victor against the injury which the Plaintiff will sustain if the injunctions were refused and then he should ultimately turn out to be victor."

In this circumstances, the Court would consider the extent of irreparable

damages to the parties in the action. In otherwords, the purpose of granting

injunction is to preserve the status quo of the property, and to prevent the

infringement of lawful right of the Plaintiff. The court would always be in favour

of the Plaintiff in this situation. In the present case it could be seen that the

gemstones prospected by the Plaintiff from an unauthorized land for him and

thereby no any lawful right of the Plaintiff has been infringed.

Once the balance of convenience has been proved the Court would

consider the equitable consideration which means the conduct and dealings of

the parties encompassing waiv~r, laches and unclean hand of the person who

seeks injunction, waiver by Plaintiff or acquiesces by him in the Defendants

conduct would be a bar to granting of equitable remedy of injunction based on

discretionary power of the conduct of laches of the Plaintiff may prevent

granting of injunction held in Sithambaram vs Palaniappa 5 NLR 553, the Court

would consider whether the applicant has invoked the jurisdiction of the Court

with clean hand as stated in the cases of Ranjan vs Sellasamy 1994 2 SLR 377 -

384 and Pounce vs Ganegama 40 NLR 76.

In the present case it is admitted by the parties before the learned District

Judge that the said gemstones prospected by the Plaintiff during the course of

inquiry for the cancellation of the license on 22.2.2001, but before the proforma

cancellation on 21.3.2001. I shows that the licence was in force until 21.03.2001.

In this circumstance the proper action for the Plaintiff was a writ jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal as this matter falls in the list of the Central Government. It

is observed in the cases of Jayasena vs Punchi Appuhamy and another 1980 2

SLR 43 and Weerasinghe vs Podi Mahathmaya and others 1994 3 SLR 230.

Therefore the Plaintiff failed to invoke writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in

respect of the seizure or confiscation of the gemstones by the Defendant too.

Taking into consideration all these matters, it is my considered view that

the learned District Judge was right in refusing the application for interim

injunction filed Plaintiff in the District Court of Ratnapura.

In the circumstance I see no reason to interfere with the judgment that is

i.mpugned in this application. Accordingly, the application for leave to Appeal is

dismissed without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Deepali Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
