The Officer in Charge of police station Pitigala filed information in

the Magistrate Court of Elpitiya under section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act on a land dispute where threatening breach of the peace has

arisen. After filing the affidavits, documents and written submissions by the

parties, the learned Magistrate determined that the 1 st Respondent

, .

3

Respondent (the 1 st Respondent) was in possession and was dispossessed

within two months prior to filing the information and ordered to place the 1 st

respondent in possession. Being aggrieved by the said order, the 1 st, i h and

8th Appellants moved in revision in the High Court of Balapitiya which was

dismissed by the learned High Court Judge. The Appellants appealed

against the said order of the learned High Court Judge to this Court. These

facts are undisputed. (Since the appeal been withdrawn, the record has been

remitted to the High Court. These facts were gathered from the petition filed

by the 1 st Respondent and the written submissions of the parties)

The appeal came up for argument on several days but on the

application of the Appellants the argument had to postponed again and again

and on 10.11.2014 the Counsel for the Appellants submitted to Court that

the permanent house constructed in the disputed land cannot be demolished

as per the authority of Jamis v. Kannangara [1989] 2 Sri L R 350. He further

submitted that the (ih) Appellant is only claiming the house and not the

balance land and moved for a date to convince his client to institute a civil

action. This is a unilateral submission. On his application the argument was

postponed to another date. On the next date, i.e. on 23.03.2013 the

Appellant withdrew the appeal without cost. On that day also the Counsel

for the Appellant made a submission and stated that "the status quo of the

dispute land can be maintained until a partition action file in the District

Court by anyone who is interested to the dispute land. " The learned Counsel

"in the circumstances, moved to withdraw the appeal" and the Court has

allowed the application to withdraw. The appeal has been dismissed without

costs.

After the appeal had been dismissed, the order of dismissal was

transmitted to the relevant High Court with the case record. The 1 st

Respondent being successful in the Magistrate Court, High Court, and the

4

appeal in this Court being withdrawn, made an application to the Magistrate

Court to execute the order. The Appellants filed several motions in this

Court stating that the 15t Respondent is violating the undertaking given to

this Court that the status quo will be maintained until a partition action is

filed. The 15t Respondent's contention is that there was no such undertaking

given by the 15t Respondent and there was no necessity to give such an

undertaking because the 15t Respondent was successful in Magistrate Court

as well as in High Court. The Court directed both parties file written

submissions regarding this issue.

The Appellant submitted that my predecessors, His Lordship

Chitrasiri J. and Her Ladyship Malanie Gunarathne J. explained to the 15t

Respondent that a permanent construction cannot be demolished under the

Primary Court Procedure Act. The record does not bear that. Unless it can

be established by reference to the case record, I cannot rely on a statement

which is said to be made by the Judges. Especially, when the accuracy of

the statement purported to be made by the judges is questionable as the

authority of Jemis v. Kannangara (supra) was not followed in the

subsequent judgments of Tuder v. Anulawathie and others [1999] 3 Sri L R

235 and Gandhi v. Mubarak [2003] 3 Sri L R 31.

The issue at the moment is whether the submission made by the

learned Counsel for the Appellants on 23.03.2015 is binding on the

Respondent. The learned Counsel for the Appellant made certain

submissions on the previous day, on 10.11.2014, and made an application

for a postponement. It was only an application for a postponement. He has

given reasons for the application. Therefore, the submission made on

10.11.2014 has no binding effect on other parties. The submission made on

23.03.2015 is also a unilateral submission. The learned Counsel for the

Appellant indicated to Court that the "status quo can be maintained". No

5

other party has agreed to this suggestion. Therefore, the 1 st Respondent

cannot be held is bound to maintain status quo.

The learned Counsel submits that the words "in the circumstances"

used in giving reasons for withdrawal indicate the agreement of the parties. I

do not agree with this submission. These words can be used for several

reasons. The 1 st Respondent being the successful party in the Magistrate

Court as well as High Court, there is no reason for him to give up his victory

and allow the Appellant to be in possession of the disputed land indefinitely.

Therefore, unless there is a definite agreement to maintain the status quo by

the 1 st Respondent, Court cannot presume that the 1 st Respondent has agreed

to maintain the status quo. There is no definite agreement or undertaking

given by the 1 st Respondent to maintain status quo.

As the 1 st Respondent has not given any undertaking to maintain the

status quo, I hold that the 1 st Respondent cannot be held liable for violating

any undertaking by making an application to execute the writ of possession

in the Magistrate Court.

I agree.
