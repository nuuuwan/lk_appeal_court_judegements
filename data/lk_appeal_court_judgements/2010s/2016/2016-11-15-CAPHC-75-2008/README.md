This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Balapitiya.

The facts in the case are briefly as follows. The Complainant 2nd

Respondent 2nd Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to

as the Respondent) issued quit notice under State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 (as amended) against the Respondent

Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Appellant). The Appellant being disobeyed the quit notice, the

Respondent instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Elpitiya under

section 5 of the Act to eject the Appellant. The Appellant contested the

correctness of the application for ejectment i.e., the copy of the quit

notice, the application and the affidavit. The Appellant's argument is that

the inapplicable words in the said application for ejectment have not been

deleted or struck off and therefore the papers are not in conformity with

the Act. The learned Magistrate considered the issue and observed that in

the certified copy issued to the Appellant those inapplicable words have

not deleted, but the in the original document in the record, the

inapplicable words have been deleted. Accordingly the learned

Magistrate has overruled the objections and issued the ejectment order in

favour of the Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said order the

Appellant moved in revision in the High Court of Balapitiya where the

order of the learned Magistrate was affirmed. This appeal is from the said

order of the High Court.

The learned Counsel's argument is that the strict compliance of the

Act is necessary in an application for ejectment under State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act. I agree with the Counsel on this point. The

forms of the quit notice, the application and the affidavit are prescribed in

the Act by the Legislature. Those forms are also a part of the law relating

to the recovery of possession of state lands and the competent authority is

3

bound to adhere to those forms to proceed under State Lands (Recovery

of possession) Act. Otherwise the application to ejectment is bad in law.

In the case of Kandiah V. Abeykoon (Sriskantha Law Reports Volume iv

page 96) wherein Their Lordship expressed thus; "I am of the view that

upon a true construction of the statute as a whole, the form of notice,

application and affidavit had to be in strict compliance with those which

the legislature has thought important enough to set out in the schedule

before the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to eject a person in possession or

occupation could be exercised. " In a more recent case of

S.S.B.D.GJayawardane v. K.N.Deen CA (PHC) 149/2014 CA minutes

dated 17.06.2015 Walgama J. held that "Therefore it is abundantly clear

that the strict compliance of the conditions contained in the above Act

should be followed in this process."

Issue in the present case is whether there is a non compliance of the

law. In the certified copy issued to the Appellant by the Court, the

inapplicable word in the quit notice, the application and the affidavit have

not deleted. In the quit notice out of the words "in occupation/possession"

the inapplicable words have to be deleted and in the application out of the

words "the notice served on/exhibited in or upon the said land" and in the

words "in occupation/possession" the inapplicable words have to be

deleted. In the affidavit out of the words "sworn/affirmed" the

inapplicable word has to be deleted. The learned Counsel for the

Appellant argues that the application is bad in law because of the

inapplicable words were not deleted. As I said early, the learned

Magistrate has observed that in the original record the inapplicable words

have deleted.

It is an observation of the learned Magistrate. This observation

cannot be challenged because the case record bears the proof. The

4

certified copies issued to the Appellant are also tendered to Court for

perusal. These copies are not photo copies, they are type written copies.

Therefore there is a possibility of not including the striking off by pen in

the type written copy.

The learned Counsel submitted that in the original record those

inapplicable words were deleted "mysteriously". I don't find any

mysterious act in missing the hand written deletion in the type written

copy. The person who deleted the inapplicable words has initialed them.

Therefore the authentication of the deletion is also not in issue.

I agree with the finding of the learned High Court Judge that there

is no reason to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate.

The order of the learned High Court Judge is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
