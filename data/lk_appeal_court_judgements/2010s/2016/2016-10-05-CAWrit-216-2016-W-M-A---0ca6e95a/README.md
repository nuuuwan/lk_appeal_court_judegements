VIJITH K. MALALGODA. PCJ (PICA)

Heard Counsel in support of this application.

1

The petitioner has come before this Court challenging the

decision by the 1 st respondent, to take over a land which is referred to

in this application by parate execution. However, we observe that the

petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court as to why the steps taken by

the said bank should be questioned by way of a writ application before

this Court.

As revealed before us the Petitioner has obtained a loan and

overdraft facility but not taken steps to settle the same since the year

2012. The 1st respondent even after obtaining a Board decision in the

2

year 2013 to auction the said land had again delayed the said process to

gIVe an opportunity to the petitioner to settle the dispute between the

parties.

Since the 1 st respondent bank had gIven an ample

opportunity to the petitioner, we cannot agree with the petitioner that the

decision taken by the 1 st respondent is illegal, mala fide and/ or in

violation of Rules of Natural Justice.

Under these circumstances we are not inclined to issue

notices in this case. The application is accordingly dismissed.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

I agree.
