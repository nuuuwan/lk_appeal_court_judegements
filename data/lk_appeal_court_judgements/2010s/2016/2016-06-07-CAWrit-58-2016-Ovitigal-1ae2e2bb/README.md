VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PCJ (PICA)

Heard Counsel for the petitioner and the learned State Counsel

representing the respondents in this matter.

This application refers to a school admission to the year 2016 of a

child by the name Ivindu Induwara. According to the petitioner the child

who had applied to be admitted to the school by the name of St. Mary's

Vidyalaya, Matugama under the house hold category but comes within

the religious groups where there is certain percentage has been allocated

to the Christian students. However, we observe that the said school has

a criteria to identify the applicant as a Christian and the said document

has been produced marked P7. In the said document the applicant is

advised to submit certain documents in order to satisfy that they belong

to the particular religion. According to the submissions made before this

l I2 f

Court it was transpired that the petitioner has failed to submit certain i ,

documents specially, the documents which required under No.5 and 6

along with the application. It is also revealed during the submissions I

f before this Court that the petitioner's two elder children had been " ~. t

admitted to the same school and at that time the petitioner has not

declared that he is a Christian and in fact the two children are presently

studying Buddhism in the school even though there are facilities at

school to study Christianity.

When considering the submissions made by both parties, we see

no merit in this application and therefore we are not inclined to issue

notices in this application. Notices are refused and the application is

accordingly dismissed. No costs is ordered.
