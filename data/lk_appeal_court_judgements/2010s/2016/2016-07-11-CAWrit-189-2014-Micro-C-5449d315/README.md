c) Grant a writ III the nature of a Certiorari quashing the impugned order of the 1st

Respondent contained in and/or communicated to the Petitioner, via the documents

marked P-16 and P-17 to the petition.

As revealed before this court, in or around July 2012 the Petitioner introduced a transport vehicle

known as "Micro Loader" to the Sri Lankan market which is a mini truck of Chinese make, partly

assembled in Sri Lanka with a warranty of 50,000 km or 1 year which ever may occur first.

On or around 1st December 2012 the 6th Respondent ordered a Micro Loader from the Matara Branch of

the Petitioner with a leasing facility obtained from the Hatton National Bank PLC. The quotation

provided by the Petitioner to sell the vehicle at a price of LKR 900,000/- was accepted by the 6th

Respondent on 21st December 2012 and the vehicle duly registered with the Registrar of Motor

Vehicles under Registration No. SP PU-9415 was handed over to the Petitioner on 16th January 2013

with a standard warranty copy which provided before this court is marked as P-5.

On two occasions in July and August 2013 the 6th Respondent complained the Petitioner that the brakes

in the vehicle were not sufficient. When the complaint was made to the Petitioner's agent in Matara in

July 2013, the agent had attended to the vehicle and handed over to the 6th Respondent. However the 6th

Respondent had once again complained of the same defect in the August 2013 and the petitioner

brought the vehicle to the service centre at Colombo in order to attend the vehicle.

It was revealed that the 6th Respondent had refused to accept the vehicle back, once the Petitioner

completed the repair informing that the brakes were not up to the standard. As revealed before this

court, the 6th Respondent had complained to the 1st Respondent Authority on 03.09.2013 informing that

the "Braking System" of the Micro Loader he purchased from the Petitioner Company suddenly failed

and although the Petitioner Company repaired it, the defective nature of braking system has not been

rectified.

It was further revealed before this court that the 6th Respondent, before making the complaint with the

1st Respondent Authority had made representations to the Petitioner by letter dated 06.08.2013.

Since then some meetings between the parties and correspondents were exchanged, the parties have not

reached a settlement between them.

By letter dated 16.09.2015 the 1st Respondent informed both parties to be present for a discussion on

27.09.2013 at 11.30 am. Petitioner did not turn up for the said meeting but informed by his letter dated

27.09.2013 their inability to be present for the discussion. By letter dated 02.lD.2013 the 1st Respondent

re-scheduled the said discussion for lD.lD.2013.

On lD.lD.2013 both parties appear before the 1st Respondent Authority and at the discussion the 6th

Respondent complained of repeated defective position of the brakes system, and informed that he has

no confidence and trust of the vehicle and requested the refund of the money spend on the vehicle.

As against the said request the Petitioner took up the position that, the Petitioner had several

discussions with the 6th Respondent earlier and as agreed at those discussions the Petitioner is agreeable

to extend the warranty period by another one year and grant free services for the value of Rs. 27,000/-

which is the lease rental for the period, the vehicle was stationed at the Petitioner's garage.

Since there was no settlement between the parties, the parties agreed to fix the matter for inquiry before

the 1st Respondent Authority.

It is further revealed before this court that subsequent to the said meeting the Petitioner had wrote to the

1st Respondent informing his position.

a) That prior to the compliant made to the 1st Respondent by the 6th Respondent at a discussion

with the 6th Respondent the Petitioner had on 14.09.2013, the Petitioner promised to the 6th

Respondent to increase the period of warranty by a further 1 year and for the period the

Micro Loader was stationed at the Petitioner's Garage the equivalent sum of the lease rental

of Rs. 27,000 free service could be provided.

b) That the 6th Respondent visited Petitioner on 12.09.2013 and inspected the Micro Loader

and requested that if the sum of Rs. 27,000/- is made by the Petitioner there would not be

any dispute.

c) However at the discussion on 10.10.2013 the 6th Respondent changed his earlier position

and refused to accept the Micro Loader;

d) That the 6th Respondent by his letter dated 23.09.2013 has informed the Petitioner that he is

not satisfied with regard to the repair done on the Micro Loader.

e) Accordingly, the Petitioner has requested to communicate to him the next steps the 1st

Respondent proposes to take.

Since no settlement was reached between the two parties the 1st Respondent by his letter dated

05.12.2013 noticed the parties to attend an inquiry on 17.12.2013 under section 13 (1) of the Consumer

Authorities Act No.9 of 2003.

Section 13 (1) of the said Act reads thus;

13 (1) the Authority may inquire into complaints regarding,

a) The production, manufacture, supply, storage, transportation or sale of any good and to the

supply of any services which does not conform to the standard and specifications

determined under section 12 and

b) The manufacture or sale of any goods which does not conform to the warranty or guarantee

given by implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer or trader

According to the proceedings of the said inquiry which was produced marked P-13 the 6th Respondent

had made a detail statement giving the events took place since the date he purchased the vehicle, before

the tribunal.

6

According to the said statement made by the 6th Respondent he had purchased the vehicle in question in

the month of January 2013 subject to a leasing facility from the Hatton National Bank for the purpose

of transporting fruits and vegetables from distance places and sell. When he discovered the fault of the

braking system on 28.07.2013 he immediately communicated with the Petitioner Company and handed

over the vehicle to the company on 29.07.2013. Since then the vehicle was repaired by the Petitioner

more than two occasions but the 6th Respondent was not happy with the repairs done and therefore

refused to receive the vehicle from the petitioner.

As against the said complaint by the 6th Respondent, the Petitioner's representative who represented the

Petitioner at the inquiry whilst admitting that there was a defect in the vehicle, submitted that the said

defect had been now attended to by the petitioner Company, but further submitted that he would

discuss this matter again with the Petitioner Company and inform their position in three weeks.

By letter dated 07.01.2014 the Petitioner has informed the 1st respondent that, the Petitioner Company

has agreed to award an extended warranty for another one year and make a cash payment of Rs. 27,

000/- to the 6th Respondent.

However, the 1st Respondent as informed on the 17.12.2013 that the 1st Respondent would make an

order with regard to the inquiry if no settlement is reached, has communicated to the petitioner by his

letter dated 30.04.2014 the decision of the 1st Respondent to the effect, that he has been directed to pay

Rs. 900,000/- to the 6th Respondent through the Hatton National Bank. A copy of the order made by the

tribunal dated 25.03.2014 too was attached to the said letter.

Being dissatisfied with the said decision of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner has come before this court

seeking a writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision on several grounds averred before us.

The Petitioner has challenged the decision of the 1st Respondent on the grounds that,

7

a) There was no sufficient evidence before the Tribunal to come to the conclusion in the

impugned decision or in other word the impugned order marked P-17 is based on no

evidence rule

b) There was no finding by the 1 SI Respondent that the "Goods not conforming to the warranty

or guarantee" when concluding inquiry

c) The said decision has violated the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act and the Finance

Leasing Act

d) The inquiry panel has failed to consider alternative relief or had acted unreasonably

e) The inquiry panel has failed to consider the statutory time bar imposed by section 13 (2) of

the Consumer Affairs Authority Act.

The inquiry panel has failed to consider the statutory time bar,

Section 13 (2) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act reads thus,

"A complaint under subsection (1) which relates to the sale of any goods or to the provision of

any services shall be made to the authority in writing within three months of the sale of such

goods or the provision of such service as the case may be."

Based on the above provision of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act the Petitioner has argued that

under the provisions of the act the complaint had to be made, which relates to the sale of any goods or

to the of any service within three months of the sale and the fact that the Petitioner did not raise such

objection at the hearing before the Authority cannot give a Public Authority more power than it

legitimately posses.

Section 13 (1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act provides for,

"The Authority may inquiry into complaints regarding

i III1

\ 1

j

1 l I I

8

a) The production, manufacture, supply, storage, transportation or sale of any goods

and to the supply of any services which does not conform to the standards and

specifications determined under section 12; and

b) The manufacture or sale of any goods which does not conform to the warranty or

guarantee given by implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer or trader

As revealed during the arguments before this court the Petitioner had given a standard warranty of

50,000 km or 1 year which ever may occur first. A copy of the said standard warranty was produced

before this court marked P-5 and according to the said warranty, 12 months or 50,000 km (whichever f Icomes first) warranty had been given to the, brake master pump and vacuum booster excluding brake

lining or brake pads, brake drums or discs in the brake system. i,

When considering the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act along with its long title this I

court is of the view that, the said Act has been primarily promUlgated for the purpose of the effective

competition and protection of the consumers. Therefore it is of paramount importance to view the

provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act in the perspective of not only of the effective

competition but necessarily focusing on the interest of the protection of the innocent consumers.

Under these circumstances it is the duty of this court when interpreting the provisions of the Consumer

Affairs Authority Act, to be mindful of the object of the above Act.

It was discussed in the case of Wickramarathne V. Samarawickrema (1995) 2 Sri LR 2, by S.N. Silva

(J) (as he was then) the importance of the interpretation of a statute without defecting the objective as

follows;

"The basic rule of interpretation is that the legislative objective should be advanced and the

provisions be interpreted in keeping with the purpose of the legislature, interpretation should not

have the effect of defeating the objective of the legislature and of detracting from its purpose."

9

With regard to the calculation of time bar under section 13 (2) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act,

this court on several occasions had considered the provisions of the said section and given

interpretation and I would like to consider some of them in order to analyze the mind of the judiciary

when deciding those cases.

In the case of David Peiris Motor Company V. Consumer Affairs Authority and 8 Others

CA/Writ/635/2007 (CA minute dated 03/08/2009) the court observed that,

" ............... .it is common ground that the Petitioner has gIVen a warranty of 2 years or

30,000km for the vehicle in question

The time limit of three months stipulated in section 13 (2) is in relation to a complaint of

the sale of any goods or to the provision of any service which does not conform to the standards

and specifications determined under section 12. But this time limit does not apply to the

production, manufacture, supply, storage and transportation which does conform to the

standards and specifications determined under section 12 and the manufacture or sale of the

goods which does not conform to the warranty or guarantee given by the manufacturer or

tender.

Section 13 (2) must be given a purposive interpretation. If a warranty of goods covers for a

period of two years and the purchaser can only complain within three months of the purchase of

the goods in relation to the breach of a warranty or guaranty, it will lead to absurdity and the

protection given by section 13 (1) (b) would be rendered nugatory. Section 13(2) has imposed a

three months limitation for complaints only in relation to the sale of any goods or to the

provision of any service which does not conform to the standards and specifications determined

under section 12. "

In the case of Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. V. Consumer Affairs Authority and 8 Others

CA/Writ/ 326/2006 (CA minute dated 18/02/2011) the same issue with regard to a consumable item

which was sold with an implied warranty was discussed as follows:

"Under subsection (2) of the section 13 a complaint could be made to the Authority in writing

within three months of the sale of such goods. By this provision one can make a complaint to

the Authority against a manufacturer of any goods which does not conform to the warranty or

guarantee given by implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer unless and until that product

is sold. Once such product is sold a consumer could complain within three months from the

time of sale of the product against the manufacturer. The legislature in its wisdom has not

included the manufacture of a good in section 13 subsection (2) as the manufacturer of a good is

entitled to detect a defective good after manufacture and could remove it from sale. If a

detective good is detected after manufacture of the same it cannot be a cause of complaint of a

consumer. The consumer can complain only if the manufacturer allows a defective good to be

sold it to a consumer. That is why the legislature in section 13 (2) imposes a time limit to

complaint against a sale of a product which does not conform to the warranty or guaranty given

by implication by the manufacturer. It is an admitted fact that the said product (1 Y2 liter Lion

Club Soda) was manufactured by the Petitioner and was sold from an outlet on 24.01.2004 and

the complaint was made against the manufacturer on 11th March 2004 which is within three

months from the sale of such goods. Therefore the submission that the Consumer Mfairs

Authority by entertaining the complaint of the 2nd Respondent under section 13 (1) of the

consumer Mfairs Authority Act acted without jurisdiction is untenable."

Even though the Petitioners have argued that the decisions of the said cases are contrary to each other,

this court cannot agree with the said argument,

As observed in the case of Wickremarathna V. Samarasekara there is a duty cast upon the court to

interpret legislation without defeating the objectives of the legislation. As against a motorcycle which

11

was sold with a 2 years warranty and a beverage sold with an implied warranty that it will be

reasonably fit for consumption, the court cannot use the same yardstick when interpreting what the

legislature has though fit for to the given case. When a consumable is sold without a specific warranty

but with a implied warranty that it will be reasonably fit for consumption, the provisions of section 13

(2) will have to be strictly apply from the date of purchase by the customer and when a product is sold

with a specific warranty, section 13 (2) must be given a purposive interpretation. If the warranty is

given for a period of one year and the purchaser can only complain in relation to a breach of a warranty

or guaranty within 3 months only the protection given by section 13 (1) (b) would be rendered

nugatory.

Therefore I see no merit in the said argument raised by the Petitioner.

There was no sufficient evidence before the tribunal to come to the decision III the

impugned order (no evidence rule)

There was no finding by the 1st Respondent that the goods not conforming to the

warranty or guarantee when concluding inquiry

As observed by this court the matter relates to the complaint and the subsequent inquiry was mainly

based on the condition of the braking system of the micro loader truck sold by the Petitioner.

It was revealed for the inquiry proceedings submitted before this court, that the 6th Respondent had

purchased the said vehicle for the purpose of transporting fruits and vegetables from out stations to the

city in order to sell them in the city. The 6th Respondent had complaint that the braking system of the

said vehicle was failed within 7 months. When he complained, to the local agent, the vehicle was

repaired at Matara itself and returned to him. Since there was no improvement of the braking system

the vehicle was taken to Colombo by the Petitioner and attended to it in Colombo. When the vehicle

ttl ,

~

t

I! t ! I II

\II!

12

was inspected by the 6th Respondent after repairs, had observed the same defect in the braking system

and complained to the Petitioner once again and refused to accept the vehicle.

During the inquiry the Petitioner had admitted the fact that there was a failure in the braking system

initially after 7 months from the sale of the said vehicle. The petitioner had further admitted that the

Petitioner had attended to the said defect twice within one month. When the Complainant had placed

the above evidence and stated that even after the repair for the second time in Colombo, he observed

the same defect in the vehicle, the Petitioner has never challenged the above position at the inquiry.

When going through the proceedings of the inquiry, it appears that the Complainant's evidence had

gone to the record unchallenged and the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence in contrary.

During the arguments before us the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner had argued that there was no

expert evidence before the tribunal to conclude that the braking system was defective even after the

repairs were carried out, but we see no reason for the tribunal to look for any expert evidence since the

Petitioner had failed to challenge the position taken up by the Complainant.

As observed by us, the only application made by the Petitioner, after the Complainant placed his

position before the inquiry, was to consult the management and inform their position, which the

Petitioner has done on.07.01.2014 (P-14) but even in the said letter the Petitioner had never challenged

the position taken up by the Complainant at the inquiry.

As observed by H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, "No evidence does not mean only a total dearth of

evidence. It extends to any case where the evidence taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of

supporting the finding" (Wade an Forsyth Administrative Law J(jh Edition at page 229- Allison V.

General Medical Council (1894) 19B 750 at 760).

In the absence of any material placed before the tribunal in challenging the version given by the

Complainant, and the admission by the petitioner of the defect in the braking system even after being

repaired by the local agent and the company work shop on the 1st occasion, the said unchallenged

I

evidence placed before the tribunal was more than sufficient for the tribunal to come to the conclusion

reached in this case and therefore we see no merit in the said argument.

The tribunal in their decision which is produced marked P-17 after analyzing the material placed before

them, had made the following observation before coming to their findings.

From the above observation made by the tribunal it is clear that the tribunal was mindful of the fact that

the goods sold was not conforming to the warranty or guarantee given by the petitioner and that is the

very reason after making such observation the tribunal proceeded to make an order directing to pay the

money spent for purchasing the said vehicle to the petitioner.

As observed by this court the said decision was not communicated to the parties at the conclusion of the

inquiry since the Petitioner moved time for him to inform whether the matter could be settled between

the parties but when there was no settlement reached the said decision was communicated to the parties

and in the said decision the tribunal had made observations referred to above.

Failure to consider Alternative Relief -Unreasonableness

Section 13 (4) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act reads thus;

"where after an inquiry into a Complaint, the Authority is of opinion that a manufacture or sale of any

goods or the provision of any services has been made which does not conform to the standards or

specifications determined or deemed to be determined by the Authority, or that a manufacture or sale

has been made of any goods not conforming to any warranty or guarantee given by implication or

otherwise by the manufacturer or trader, it shall order the manufacturer or the trader to pay

compensation to the aggrieved party or to replace such goods or to refund the amount paid for such

goods or the provision of such service as the case may be.

As referred to in the above section the Act has provided the tribunal to compensate the aggrieved

parties by

a) Pay compensation

b) Replace such goods

c) Refund the amount paid for such goods or provision of such service

as the case may be."

When considering the said provisions it is our view that the said provision has given discretion to the

tribunal to consider as to how they are going to compensate the aggrieved party considering the facts of

the each case or as referred to in the act itself as "as the case may be"

j I!i ! ll tI,

I i! 1

15 ,

Subramaniam Shanmugam Vs. M.L. Rajebdran (1987) 4 see 215 the meaning of expression "as the

case may be" is what the expression says, i.e. as the situation may be, in other words in case there are

separate and distinct units then concept of need will apply accordingly.

Union of India V. Ashok Kumar (2205) 8 see 760

The expression "as the case may be" is used in sub rule 2 and sub rule 5. It obviously mean either of the

two. The words "as the case may be" mean whichever the case may be or as the situation may be ... "

In this regard we observe that the tribunal was mindful of the fact that the 6th Respondent had

purchased the said vehicle to purchase fruits and vegetables from out stations in order to sell them in

the city and due to its condition, the vehicle the 6th Respondent had purchased was not suitable for his

purpose when considering as to how the 6th Respondent should be compensated in the present case.

This was observed in the order as follows;

and therefore it is clear that the final decision of the tribunal to direct the petitioner to refund the

amount paid for the purchase of the vehicle in question was made after giving due consideration to the

material placed before the tribunal. Under these circumstances this court cannot agree with the

contention of the Petitioner that the order given by the tribunal is unreasonable and/or it is not

proportionate to the loss or damage suffered by the 6th Respondent.

As the final ground of appeal the Petitioner has submitted before this court that since the said vehicle

was purchased on a hire purchase basis granted by a bank, the impugned order was made in violation of

the of the provisions of the Finance Leasing Act No. 56 of 2000.

In this regard we observe the following order made by the tribunal in P-17.

16 ...

In the said order the tribunal was mindful of the fact that the said vehicle was purchased on a hire

purchase basis and therefore had given a specific direction to refund the money to the 6th Respondent

through the relevant bank and therefore we see no merit in the said argument.

For the reasons set out above, we see no merit in the arguments placed before us by the Petitioner and

therefore not inclined to issue a Writ of Certiorari in order to quash the impugned order. We therefore

make order dismissing this application with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-

Application is dismissed.
