This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Colombo

refusing notice in a revision application. The facts are briefly as follows.

The Accused Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter called and referred

as to the Appellant) was charged in the Magistrate Court of Colombo on

an offence of cheating the complainant punishable under section 400 of

the Penal Code by taking Rs. 80,000.00 on the promise of securing a

foreign employment but has not kept to the promise. The second charge

was an alternative charge of misappropriation. The Appellant pleaded

guilty to the charge on 18.01.2010 and moved time to pay the money. The

Court has given time till 01.03.2010 to pay the money but has not being

paid, imposed one year RI and ordered to pay Rs. 80,000.00 as

compensation with a default term of one year imprisonment. The second

count being an alternative charge, no sentence was imposed.

The Appellant had 10 other cases of the similar nature, cheating

people on the promise of securing foreign employment and collecting

4

money without sending them for foreign employment, has pleaded guilty.

He was given the same punishment in those ten cases too, aggregating 11

years RI and another 11 years imprisonment in default of payment of

compensation.

The Petitioner after 3 years, on 03.04.2013 filed a reVISIOn

application in the High Court of Western Province seeking an order to run

the sentences concurrently. The learned High Court Judge dismissed the

application without issuing summons. This appeal is from the said order.

The revision is a discretionary remedy granted by the Court on

exceptional circumstances. It is settled law that the extraordinary

jurisdiction of revision can be invoked only on establishing the

exceptional circumstances. The requirement of exceptional circumstances

has been held in a series of authorities. Ameen v. Rasheed 3 CL W 8,

Rastom v. Hapangama [19787-79] 2 Sri L R 225, Cader (on behalf of

Rashid Kahan) Vs Officer - In - Charge Narcotics Bureau, [2006] 3 Sri L

R 74, Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and others V. Commissioner of Labour

[1998] 3 Sri L R 320 are some of the authorities where it has been

emphasized that unless the existences of the exceptional circumstances

are been established in cases where an alternative remedy is available,

revisionary jurisdiction cannot be invoked.

His lordship Justice Gamini Amarathunga expressed the reason for

the necessity to establish the exceptional circumstances in the case of

Dharmarathne v. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. [2003] 3 Sri L R 24 at page

29 held:

The requirement of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction is not a requirement statutorily laid down

anywhere. As Gunawardana J, himself has referred to, Abrahams

CJ. in Ameen v Rashid (supra) has explained the rationale for

5

insisting on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the

exercise of revisionary jurisdiction. According to Abrahams CJ.

revision of an appealable order is an exceptional proceeding and a

person seeking this method of rectification must show why this

extra-ordinary method is sought rather than the ordinary method

of appeal. As Hutchinson CJ. has stated in Perera v Silva (supra) it

is not possible to contend that the power ought to be exercised or

that the legislature could have intended that it should be exercised

so as to give the right of appeal practically in every case. Thus the

existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

Court selects the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary

method of rectification should be adopted. If such a selection

process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will

become a gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the

garb of a revision application or to make an appeal in situations

where the legislature has not given right of appeal.

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken

deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not

indicate that it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice'.

The exceptional circumstances are explained in the case of Vanic

Incorporation Ltd v. Jayasekara [1997] 2 Sri L R 365 where it was held;

In the case of Attorney-General v. Podi Singho (supra) Dias, J.

held that even though the revisionary powers should not be

exercised in cases when there is an appeal and was not taken, the

revisionary powers should be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances such as (a) miscarriage of justice (b) where a strong

[ttI

,

6

case for interference by the Supreme Court is made out or (c)

where the applicant was unaware of the order. Dias, J also

observed that the Supreme Court in exercising its powers of

revision is not hampered by technical rules of pleading and

procedure.

The appellant has failed to plead and establish exceptional

circumstances in the application presented to the High Court. Therefore,

the learned High Court Judge's finding that no exceptional circumstances

to entertain the revision application; need not be interfered with.

The appellant moved the High Court in revision after three of the

conviction and sentence. No any explanation offered for this remarkable

delay.

The Appellant's application is for an order to run the sentences

concurrently. The law does not provide to order the sentences in different

cases to run concurrently. If the conviction is in the same trial only, the

sentences can be ordered to run concurrently. In cases where there is a

previous conviction and serving a term, the next sentence starts to run on

the expiration of the earlier sentence. The section 300 reads thus;

300. When a person actually undergoing imprisonment lS

sentenced to imprisonment such imprisonment shall commence at

the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been previously

sentenced.

When the Appellant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment

In the first case, his term of imprisonment starts and therefore, the

subsequent term of imprisonment in the next case start on the expiration

of the previous term of imprisonment. His Lordship Justice Gamini

Amarathunga explained the law in the case of Weerawarnakula v. The

Republic Of Sri Lanka [2002] 3 Sri L.R. 213. His Lordship observed in a

similar case that;

The learned counsel for the accused-appellant contended that the

learned High Court Judge should have ordered the sentences of

imprisonment imposed on the accused-appellant in case No.

998/93 concurrent with the sentences of imprisonment ordered in

case No. 997/93 by him on the same day. Section 300 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, provides asfollows:

"When a person actually undergoing imprisonment is sentenced to

imprisonment such imprisonment shall commence at the expiration

of the imprisonment to which he has been previously sentenced. "

At the time the accused-appellant was sentenced in case No.

997/93, he was serving the imprisonment ordered in case No.

996/93 and in view of the provisions of section 300 quoted above

the sentence imposed in case No. 997/93 takes effect only at the

expiration of the sentence ordered in No. 996/93. The learned

counsel argued that when the accused-appellant was sentenced in

case No. 997/93 on the same day, he was not "actually undergoing

imprisonment" ordered in case No. 997/93. He contended that a

person is actually undergoing imprisonment only when he is

admitted to and accepted by the prison as a prisoner. The learned

counsel accordingly submitted that the learned High Court Judge

should have ordered the sentences imposed in case No. 99.8/93 to

run concurrently with the sentences he has imposed in case No.

997/93.

A direction that a sentence of imprisonment should run

concurrently with another sentence is strictly speaking not a part

of the sentence but a direction with regard to the execution of the

8

sentence. The general principle regarding sentences is that the

sentence takes effect from the time it is pronounced. In Shanmugam

v. Sinnappari (1) Middleton, J. stated that a sentence would run

from the time it is pronounced unless otherwise ordered. Sections

16 and 300 of the Code of Criminal 70 Procedure Act provide

exceptions to this general rule. Section 16 provides for a situation

where a person at one trial is convicted of any two or more distinct

offences. Then the Court may in its discretion sentence such person

for such offences to the several punishments prescribed therefor.

Such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence,

unless the court orders them to run concurrently, the one after the

expiration of the other in such order as the court may direct.

According to this section, the court has a discretion to direct that

the separate sentences of imprisonment shall run cencurrently.

Section 300 is applicable to a different situation than that

contemplated by section 16 of the Code. It applies to a situation

where a person actually undergoing imprisonment is in some other

case again sentenced to imprisonment. According to the section the

latter imprisonment shall commence to operate at the expiration of

the imprisonment to which he has been previously sentenced. This

is an exception to the general rule that a sentence begins to

operate from the time it is pronounced. Section 300 is couched in

imperative terms and in view of the wording of the section no court

has the power or discretion to order that a sentence of

imprisonment ordered by it shall run concurrently with a sentence

of imprisonment ordered in a previous case which the accused is

serving when he is sentenced in the 2nd case. In Godagama v.

Mathea (2) Wood Renton, J. stressing the imperative nature of

II!II

tIi

section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 (which was

identical with present section 300 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act) said that "[IJ t is not competent for a Magistrate to

order that a sentence passed on an offender who is already

sentenced for another offence shall run concurrently with the

previous sentence. "

The Indian counterpart of section 300 was section 397 of the

Indian Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 and presently it is section

427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.2 of 1974. The

present Indian section is similar to section 397 of the earlier Code.

Under section 397 no discretion was available to court to make the

later sentence of imprisonment concurrent with a previous

sentence of imprisonment ordered in an earlier case. Emperor v.

Bhikki and Others (3) . By an amendment to the Indian Criminal

Procedure Code in 1923 the words "unless the court directs that

the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with the previous

sentence" were added to section 397 and in view of this the courts

now have a discretion to order that a subsequent sentence of

imprisonment shall run concurrently with a previous sentence of

imprisonment. But, there are no similar words no in section 300 of

our law.

The learned Counsel submitted that since the charges are in similar

nature and committed on the same day, three charges would have

included in one case. If it was done so the Appellant would have made an

application for an order to run the sentences concurrently. I do not

understand the rational of this submission. The Appellant was convicted

on his own admission in 11 cases for cheating 11 persons on the premise

of securing foreign employment. He deserves heavy punishment. I do not

I I I

10

see any exceptional circumstance for the learned High Court Judge to act

III reVISIOn.

Under these circumstances, there is no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed .
