This is a revision application made by the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant to set

aside the Judgment dated 19.03.2010 of the High Court Judge of Gampaha. The

learned High Court Judge by his order dated 19.03.2010 dismissed the revision

application and affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate of Gampaha. The learned

Magistrate of Gampaha convicted the accused by her order dated 31.07.2008 and

sentenced the accused under Section 216 (B) (b) of the Motor Traffic Act and

suspended the driving license of the accused-appellant. The main point contested in

this revision application was the suspension of the driving license of the accused-

appellant.

The Counsel for the Accused Petitioner Appellant submits that he was only 26

years old at the time of the accident and eight years had lapsed since then. He moves

Court to lift the suspension. The learned Senior State Counsel submits that she has

no objection for making a suitable order regarding the suspension of driving license.
