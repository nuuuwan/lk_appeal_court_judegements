The Petitioner Respondent (Hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as

the 1 st Respondent), a medical officer (Doctor) attached to the Jaffna

Teaching Hospital, instituted this action in the High Court of Jaffna seeking

for a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of

the Government Nursing Officers Union Jaffna Teaching Hospital Branch

(Hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as Branch Union) to take a

trade union action and a writ of mandamus to compel the Union to continue

in their work. The learned High Court Judge of Jaffna issued an interim

order preventing the Union from taking any trade union action until the

conclusion of the case. The 1 st and 2nd Respondent Petitioners (Hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the 1 st and 2nd Petitioners) who are the

President and the Secretary of the Branch Union presented this revision

application to set aside the said order of the learned High Court Judge. The

Petitioners moved this Court for a stay order to stay the proceeding in the

High Court of Jaffna. This order is on the said application.

A writ of certiorari is basically granted to quash a decision and the writ of

mandamus is to perform a legal duty. The 1st Respondent stated that he

came to know that the Branch Union has taken a decision to walk out by

media reports. The so called decision was not produced in Court and the 1 st

Respondent has failed to specify the at least the date of the decision that he

wants to quash. The Petitioners do not deny that the Branch Union has taken

a decision to walk out/strike and therefore, the Court can presume by

implication that there is a decision to walk out by the Branch Union.

The grievance of the Petitioners in this application is the order of the learned

High Court Judge preventing the Branch Union from taking trade union

action. This order was made until the application for the writ of mandamus

is finally considered.

Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law ninth edition (Indian edition) page

608 referrers to the case of R v. Electricity Commissioners (1924) KB 171

where Lord Atkin LJ has defined the decisions/actions that are amenable to

writ jurisdiction as follows;

"where anybody or persons having legal authority to determine

questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to

act judicially, act in excess of their legal authority they are

subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's Bench

division exercised in there writs. "

This formula sets several requirements to bring a decision within the scope

of judicial review. The decision maker must have "the legal authority to

determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and must be under a

duty to act judicially.

Justice P.B.Banerjee in "Writ Remedies" 6th Edition at page 146 explains

the conditions precedent for issue of mandamus. He says;

4

9.2.1. Existences of legal right and duty are the conditions precedent

for the issue of mandamus.

At page 147 it says;

Lord Goddard c.J said in R. v. National Joint Council for Dental

Technician ex-parte Neate, (1953) 1 QB 704 at 707 that "the

remedies of these prerogative writs have been applied have been all

the statutory bodies on whom Parliament has conferred statutory

powers and duties which, when exercised may lead to detriment of

subjects who may have to submit to their jurisdiction. "

Dr. Sunil Coorey in his book on Principles of Administrative Law in Sri

Lanka 3rd Edition volume 2 page 855 says that "Even if the duty sought to be

enforced by mandamus is a duty of public nature, it has sometimes been

contended that the mandamus will not issue to compel its performance

unless such duty is owed by, and therefore the party to be compelled by

mandamus is a ''public body" or a "state entity" or an "instrument of

state ".

In the present case the Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus against the

President and the Secretary of a branch union of a trade union, the

Government Nursing Officers Union. It is private organization formed by

the Government nursing officers for their own benefit. The trade union has

no public duty. It does not owe any duty towered the Petitioner as a member

of the public at large. Whether it is ethical for a trade union engaged in the

health sector to walk out from their duty is a matter to be decided by

themselves. The Court cannot make any ruling on ethics in a writ

app Ii cati on.

The trade union III Issue is not a public body or a state entity or an

instrument of state. It is only a group of persons organized on a contractual

relationship for their benefit. Any decision taken by this union may have an

5

impact on general public, but it does not become a public body because of

the impact it creates on the general public. Any strike or a walk out by any

trade union in the country may have an impact on general public. Article 14

(1) (d) of the Constitution guarantees the freedom of forming and joining

trade union.

14(1) Every citizen is entitled to-

(d) the freedom to form and join a trade union;

Section 2 of the Trade Unions Ordinance defines a trade umon as an

association of workmen where one of the objects among other things of

such an association is to strike to bargain the demands. The section reads;

"trade union" means any association or combination of workmen or

employers, whether temporary or permanent, having among its

objects one or more of the following objects :-

(d) the promotion or organization of financing of strikes or

lock-outs in any trade or industry or the provision of payor

other benefits for its members during a strike or lock-out,

The section 18 allows a registered trade union to go on a strike.

18. If any trade union does not apply for registration in due time, or if

the registration of any trade union is refused, withdrawn, or

cancelled, then-

(a) .....

(b) the trade union shall not, nor shall any of its officers or

agents on behalf of the union, take part in any trade dispute or

promote, organize or finance any strike or lock-out, or provide

payor other benefits for its members during a strike or lock-

out;

6

Under these circumstances a registered trade union can, as of a right, go on

a strike to bargain their demands. In such a situation can a Court issue a

prerogative writ to prevent a trade union from going for strike action is in

doubt.

In the caption of petition presented to the High Court in this case referrers to

the ICCPR Act, but the application is not based on the said Act. ICCPR Act

is entered in the caption in hand written letters as a second thought.

Under these circumstances, it is doubtful whether Court can Issue a

mandamus preventing the Government Nursing Officers Union going for a

strike action.

The learned High Court Judge has fixed the main case for judgment. I take it

also in to consideration.

I order to stay the operation of the part (IV) of the interim order of the

learned High Court Judge of Jaffna dated 10.08.2016 and direct the learned

High Court Judge to proceed with the main case.
