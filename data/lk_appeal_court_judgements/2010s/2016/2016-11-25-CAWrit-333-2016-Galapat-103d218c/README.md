Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner in support of

this application. The Petitioners are the children of the original grantee

Galappatti Arachchige Uparis Appu. Their position before this Court is

that, after the demise of their father who made an attempt to divide

the land into 3 blocks and prepared separate documents in favour of

them but he died prior to such action been finalized. However after

the death of Uparis Appu that his wife Jane Nona has succeeded on

her life interest and he complained to this Court that, subsequent to

the death of the mother, the 2nd Respondent has now taken steps to

give a grant to the eldest brother namely Galappatti Arachchige Ajith

Indrasiri the 1 st respondent in this application. The position taken up by

the petitioners before this Court is that the land refers to a grant made

by the State and therefore the provIsIOns governIng with permits

issued under the Land Development Ordinance will not applicable and

therefore strict adherence to section 68 and 72 of the said ordinance is

not required. However when looking at the grant which was produced

before this Court is clear that the said grant has been made under

section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance. As observed by

this Court the succession when the successor was not nominated by the

grantee under the Land Development Ordinance is governed by section

68 and 72 read with the first schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance. Therefore we observed that the 2nd to 4th respondent have

acted within the powers given to them and therefore I see no reason

to interfere with the said decision by the said respondents. Therefore

this Court is not inclined to issue notices in this case. I therefore

refuse notices. The application is accordingly dismissed.
