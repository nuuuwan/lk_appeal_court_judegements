P.R.Walgama, J

The Applicant -Respondent (in short the Applicant)

instituted action In the Magistrate Court of Hatton, In

the case bearing No. 58988, against the Respondent-

Petitioner (in short the Appellant) in terms of Section 3

of the State Land Recovery of Possession Act No. 07 of

1979.

The pnmary bone of contention of the Applicant was

that the subject land belongs to the State and the

Respondent - Petitioner IS In illegal posseSSIOn of the

said land without a valid legal document. In the above

setting the Applicant has moved for an order In terms

of Section 10 of the said Act to eject the Appellant

from the above land.

In pursuant to the above application by the Applicant

the Learned Magistrate issued notice to the Respondent-

Petitioner to appear In Court and show cause as to

why the court should not issue an order to eject the

Respondent - Petitioner.

In response to the above the Respondent - Petitioner has

stated the following;

That the disputed land belonged to the Land Reform

Commission and the said Commission has by a deed of

sale sold the said land to the wife of the Respondent-

Petitioner by deed bearing No. 4170, marked as Xl.

Therefore

that the

it IS contended by the Respondent - Petitioner

disputed land is not a State Land, a private

land belongs to his wife.

It IS intensely relevant to note that the Learned

Magistrate has arrived at the conclusion that the land

described in the schedule to the notice of ejectment, is

different from the land described in the schedule to the

said deed. Besides it is noted that the extent and the

boundaries of these two lands are also different.

In the above setting the Learned Magistrate has arrived

at the conclusion that the Respondent - Petitioner is not

entitled to be In the said disputed land, as such

issued an order for ejectment In terms of Section 10

of the above Act.

Being aggrieved

Magistrate, the

reVISIOn to this

by the impugned order of the

Respondent - Petitioner came by

Court to have the said order

Learned Magistrate set aside or vacate.

Learned

way of

of the

In addition it is viewed that the Respondent - Petitioner

has produced a plan which depicts the land which he

possessed, the said plan is No. 1883 dated 18.07.2000.

It is also alleged by the Respondent - Petitioner that the

subject land belongs to his wife. The Applicant has

failed to file action against the proper party.

4

This Court has observed the fact that the Applicant

has never challenged the above plan, to say that the

Lot No. 2 of the said plan belongs to the State.

In the above back drop, when the impugned order of

the Learned Magistrate is reviewed this Court is of the

VIew that the said order cannot stand and should be

set aside forthwith.

Thus I set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate

and allow the application accordingly.
