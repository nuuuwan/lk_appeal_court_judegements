Before Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC,J (P / CAl

Counsel Prinath Fernando for the Petitioner.

Decided on: 05.08.2016

Vijith K. Malalgoda, pc, J (P / CAl

The four petitioners before this court are belonging to the teachers service but

by "PIA" to "PID" they have been given the appointments in the Sri Lanka

Principle's Service Class II Grade II on covering up duties. The petitioners

position before this court is that they have rendered a valuable service and

have been awarded several awards for their best performance and now they are

in this position for several years. However, the petitioners allege that the

respondents have not taken any steps to make their services permanent in the

principles service Class II Grade II. They further allege that there is a move to

fill the vacancies in the said service without giving any opportunity to the

petitioners and therefore the petitioners have come before this court seeking a

mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus compelling the respondents to

appoint the petitioners and all other similarly circumstanced to the due Grade

in the principles' servIce. However when

appointment, the petitioners have received

going through the letter of ~ observed that the said

V-appointments have been made subject to certain conditions and one such

f t\r

condition was that they would only entitle with this appointment to the salary

scale of a class II grade II principle but could not be entitle to the appointment

to the same service without fulfillment of service requirements in the said

principle's service. Therefore it is clear that the petitioners have accepted these

positions by agreed to those conditions and therefore the fact that the

petitioners had a legitimate expectation of being appointed to a post in

principle service cannot be accepted. The learned counsel for the petitioner

further relied on several documents including a cabinet paper and a report by

the secretary to the cabinet but we observed that there is no cabinet decision

with regard to this. Under these circumstances, I see no merit in this

application and therefore I refusesrnotices in this matter.
