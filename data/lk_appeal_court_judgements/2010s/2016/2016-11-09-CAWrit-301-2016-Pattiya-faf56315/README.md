There are several cases pending before this Court against the action

that had been taken by the Forest Department to evict the Petitioners from

the lands said to have granted to them. Out of these cases, case Nos. 12-

49/2015 which are to be supported before us today, the learned Senio:

DSG. informs that he had only received notices but not the documents and

therefore he is not in a position to assist this Court with regard to those

cases. Therefore Court decides to take up these matters separately, once the

petitioners serve proper notices on the Attorney General.

2

With regard to cases 87-90/16 learned Senior DSG. submits that he

had not received notices in any of these cases and therefore we direct the

Petitioners to serve notices on the Respondents.

In the cases C.A. 292-301/2016, learned Senior DSG. submits that he

is ready to make submissions, since the said cases are similar in nature.

With regard to CA 302/2016 the learned Senior DSG. Prefers that matter be

taken separately since the facts are slightly different. Therefore the Court

decides to take up the cases C.A. 292-301/2016 for support today.

At this stage parties agreed to take up cases 292-301/2016 together

but the submissions were made by the learned President's Counsel m case

No 292/2016.

This case IS commg up for support to day. As submitted by the

learned President's Counsel for the petitioner, the petitioners predecessor

was a member of Walapane Apple Growers Cooperative Society and the

Government Agent of Nuwara-Eliya by PI decided to allocate land to the

said society to grow apples in the area. Accordingly by letter dated

31/01/ 1972, the Secretary of the said Association had informed the

membership, of distribution of the said land among the members. The

Petitioner has submitted another document marked P3 where cne R.l\l.

Chandrasena had been asked to deposit the relevant money for surveymg

fees etc. in order to allocate the land to the said Chandrasena. The Petitioner

has further submitted two receipts, one is for Rs. 150/- a payment to the

Apples Growers Society and another acreage receipt said to have paid by

R.M. Chandrasena as acreage taxes for the period 2003-200'7. Based on

3

these documents which are before this court, the Petitioner has wken Lp

the position that the Petitioner who has purchased the land in question has

legitimate expectation that he would got this land in order to cultivate t~e

apples as referred to in PI. The Petitioner has further taken up the position

that in the year 1992, a quit notice has been served by the District Forest

Officer of Nuwara Eliya and the said actions are still pending before Lie

Magistrate's Court of Walapane. The position taken up by the Petitioner

before this Court is that, at the time the said quit notices were issued, t-;e

land in question was not with the Forest Department. By the subsequent

gazette the said lands have been declared as a forest and therefore the quit

notices issued prior to that Gazette notifications are not valid in law. he

further submits that the said lands referred to this action was with the

Petitioner and his predecessor smce 1972 with uninterrupted pOSSeSSlOl1

and therefore is entitled for prescriptive title. As against these argumen~:s,

the learned Senior D.S.G appearing for the respondents had relied on 8.

document which he produced before this court where the Government Agent

of Nuwara Eliya had written to the Divisional Secretary and the Secretary of

the Apple Growers Association in December 1978 where he had d;.rected t:-le

Divisional Secretary to take over the land back from the Apple Grmvers and

hand them back to the Forest Department.

We obsenTe that this fact has not bec:l reveale:i t~()m ":.- r::

documentation submitted by "':he Petitioner eventhough the said ico,:t(;[ t.:::,

was copied to the Apple growers society, oefore this Court. The learn,:"i

, -4

D.S.G. further placed before this court another document dated 2C.05.1902

where the District Secretary of Nuwara Eliya under Section 18 cf f:I.e St2.1.e

Land (Recovery of possession) Act empowered the District Forest offiCt'j~,

Madappuli Gedara Wasala Mudiyanselage Wasantha Tikiri Band2 1'a

Dissanyake as the Competent Authority to issue orders under the sa:cl act, 0

recover state land which comes under the Forest Department.

When considering these submissions placed before us, we

observe that all these applications supported before us, namely 8pp~i(;atio ~.~ s

292/2016 - 301/2016 the persons who have been prosecuted be"ore t~n

Magistrate's Court under the State Land (Recovery of Posses5ion A~t) ;C' 'T

different for the Petitioners before this Court and the said petitior~ers ha i'e

not explained to this Court as to how they carne into the posSeSSi011 of tbis

land. The Petitioners were not parties to the oTiginal Apple Growus

Association for them to claim legitimate expectation even if this '::'ourt s

prepared to accept PI as a legally binding document. However, \VE: are :-,0(

inclined to accept PI as a legally binding document.

In these circumstances it is clear that the Petitioners conter:.t;e:n tt .t

he had legitimate expectation of getting this land is not establisb~d beL:'~

this Court. With regard to the other ~,ubmission made by r:hp lean:,,:,, '1

President's Counsel, it is clear that the eviction order issued in ';'1e y::,:r,r

1992 is a legally valid document and th,,,:re~ore we ar~ not incli rh~;d at t" ';

stage to consider it as a document which has ro legal ba~;L~. VJr'l1

considering all these issues placed before us, this Court is not inc]inr::d ~'J

5

issue notices in these cases. We therefore refuse the notices. NoticeS:3 re

refused in all ten cases C.a. 292-301/2016.
