occaSlOn the Petitioner once agrun made an

application to reopen the matter. But it IS salient to

note that once the reVlSlOn application IS dismissed

Therefore for the fore going reasons this Court is of yihe view that Petitioner- Appellant's application IS 'fIk-

unmeritorious and should stand rejected.

Appeal dismissed without costs
