JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

When these cases were taken up for argument on 2016-06-29 as well as

on 2016-07-20, all the parties agreed that the issues to be decided by this

Court in respect of the cases namely,

C A (Writ) Application No. 401 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 402/ 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 403/ 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 404 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 405 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 406 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 407 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 411 / 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 412/ 2015,

C A (Writ) Application No. 413 / 2015,

are the same, and hence they agreed that one judgment in respect of all

these cases would suffice. Hence this judgment must apply to all the cases

referred to above.

Petitioners are retired public officers. It has transpired that the Petitioners

had preferred an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)

against their being promoted on super-numerary basis. While the said

appeal was pending, the Petitioners upon reaching the retirement age, had

retired from public service. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal had

f i

trIri I I,f f! ! I

7

allowed their appeal by its order dated 2013-09-04 directing that the word

"super-numerary" in their promotion letters be removed thus converting

their promotions to permanent posts.

The Petitioners have thereafter made applications to obtain Motor-Vehicle

Permits on concessionary terms under Trade and Investment Policy Circular

No. 01 / 2013 dated 2013-08-02.

It is to be noted and highlighted the fact that the Petitioners have

submitted these applications for Motor-Vehicle permits under Trade and

Investment Policy circular No. 01/2013 dated 2013-08-02 to obtain motor

vehicles on concessionary terms, only in the year 2015, which is a date

very much after their retirement.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents by the letters marked and produced in this

proceedings, had recommended to the 1st Respondent that the Petitioners

be issued with the vehicle permits. Consequently, 1st Respondent had

issued vehicle p~rmits in the nam~ of the Petitioners. The said permits

have been marked and produced in these proceedings.

The 1st Respondent thereafter, by the letters marked and produced in this

proceedings has informed the Petitioners that the said vehicle permits

issued to them have been cancelled.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that the

issuance of the said letters cancelling the said vehicle permits are

unreasonable, arbitrary and against the rules of natural justice.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that the Petitioners,

when they were issued with the said permits, had a legitimate expectation

I

that they would be entitled to import a motor-vehicle under the said

concessionary terms on the said permits.

The Petitioners have prayed from this court inter alia, that a mandate in

the nature of writ of Certiorari be issued to quash the decisions contained

in the said letters issued by the 1st Respondent cancelling the said vehicle . . permits already issued to the Petitioners.

It is the position of the Respondents that the Director General, Department

of Trade and Investment Policy by the letters marked and produced in this

proceedings, had informed the 1st Respondent that the relevant vehicle

9

permits had been issued contrary to the regulations contained in the

circulars of the Department of Trade and Investment Policy.

Further the Director General of Department of Trade and Investment Policy

had informed the Chief Secretary of the Southern Province, that if motor-

vehicles had been imported on the said vehicle permits, such motor-

vehicles would not be qualified for the concession granted under the

circular bearing No. 01 / 2013.

The Petitioners have based their applications to obtain permits for import

of motor vehicles on concessionary terms on the Trade and Investment

Policy circular No. 01/ 2013 dated 2013-08-02. Thus it would be necessary

to examine whether this circular has any application to the Petitioners.

It could be seen in the first paragraph of this circular itself, that this

circular applies with effect from 2013-08-05 in respect of officers in active

It could ,be s~en that there had been a letter dated 2908-03-04 by the

Ministry of Finance and Planning which had amended the then existing

circular No. 01 making the public servants who are employed on a super -

ftfI

f I[iII1

10

numerary basis also eligible to apply for such vehicle permits under the

then circular dated 2007-03-30.

It was the position of the Petitioners, that the Public Service Commission

has informed them by the letter dated 2014-09-05, that their appOintments

to class 2 posts on super-numerary basis have been amended making

them as having been appointed to Class 2 posts (Permanent posts as

opposed to super-numerary posts) in SLEAS with effect from 2000-06-26.

It is their position that they therefore became eligible to apply for vehicle

permits in terms of that circular (i.e. the circular No. 01 dated 2007-03-30

as amended by the letter dated 2008-03-04).

The Petitioners have failed to establish that the said circular above referred

to, was still in force when they submitted their applications for vehicle

permits. On the contrary they have specifically based their applications on

Trade and Investment Policy circular No. 01/ 2013 dated 2013-08-02, and

not on the circular that was applicable in 2007/2008.

Furthermore it could be seen that the information the Petitioners had

supplied in their applications are not factually correct. Despite the fact that

the Petitioners are retired officers, they have given their present

designation, official address, official telephone number, the place of work

etc, to give an impression that they are officers serving in active service for

whom the said circular applies. Thus it is clear that the Petitioners are not

I!II

~ II iI I

11

entitled by any yardstick to apply for motor vehicle permits under Trade

and Investment Policy circular No. 01/ 2013 dated 2013-08-02.

The fact that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents had recommended to the 1st

Respondent that the Petitioners be issued with motor vehicle permits and

the subsequent issuance of those permits in the name of the Petitioners

are manifestly illegal.

If this court is to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent cancelling the

issuance of the said vehicle permits referred to above (which issuance is

illegal) all what this court does is facilitating the continuance of an illegal

activity unabated.

By the receipt of these vehicle permits from the authorities, the Petitioners

would have got an expectation. That expectation has to be termed as an

illegitimate expectation rather than a legitimate expectation. Thus all what

the Petitioners have established before this court is that they have had an

illegitimate expectation and not a legitimate expectation.

An expectation whose fulfillment requires that a decision maker should

make an unlawful decision, cannot be a legitimate expectation. Thus it is

. necessary that the fulfillment of the legitimate expectation, breach of which

is complained of, must be within the powers of the relevant public

authority.

Although the Petitioners have complained to this court that they were not

heard before the cancellation of their permits the 1st Respondent is under

I ~ ,

12

no duty to give the Petitioners a hearing before he declares any manifestly

illegal activity a nUllity. This is because, no amount of causes could change

the illegal status of such an action and that the relevant authority cannot

exercise any discretion to decide whether such an action should or should

not be declared a nUllity.

In these circumstances it is not difficult for this court to conclude that there

is no merit in these applications. Hence all the following applications

namely C A Writ Applications No. 401/2015 , 402/2015, 403/2015,

404/2015, 405/2015, 406/2015, 407/2015, 411/2015, 412/2015, 413/2015

are hereby dismissed but without costs.
