CASE NO. CA- 261 /2015- JUDGMENT- 05.12.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

In this appeal the 3rd Accused- appellant has called in

question the legal acceptability of the sentence passed

by the Learned High Court Judge dated 23.10.2015.

By the afore said judgement the Learned High Court

Judge has imposed on the 6th count in the indictment a

jail term of 3 years Rigorous Imprisonment, and a fine of

Rs. 100,000/ carrying a default term of 2 years with

Simple Imprisonment, Further it was directed to pay a

sum of Rs. 250,0000(25 lacks) as compensation, carryIng

a default sentence of 5 years of Simple Imprisonment.

The 3rd Accused -Appellant along with 7 others were

indicted In the High Court of Panadura. The 3rd

Accused was charged for retention of stolen property

under Section 394 of the Penal Code.

f I I i

As indicative from the case record except the 3rd

Accused- Appellant all others had pleaded guilty for the

respective charges without proceeding to trial.

The 3rd Accused - Appellant failed to make his

appearance In court and the trial proceeded against

him In absentia In terms of Section 241 of the

Criminal Procedure Code. At the conclusion of the afore

said trial the Learned Trial Judge convicted the 3rd

Accused -Appellant and passed the sentence as stated

above.

Being aggrieved by the above conviction and sentence

the 3rd Accused- Appellant has preferred this appeal and

impugned the said judgment.

The pith and substance of the Appellant's appeal IS

that by imposing the above sentence was inimical to

the fundamentals of the sentencing policy, in that there

IS a disparity of the sentence. In the appeal at the

argument stage counsel for the 3rd Accused- Appellant

informed court that he does not wish to challenge the

conviction, but only the sentence imposed on the

Accused -Appellant.

The narrative of the prosecution verSlOn IS un spooled

thus;

That the 3rd Accused - Appellant along with other

accused conspired to rob the SANASA Bank at Horana.

It IS said that the 3rd Accused - Appellant was aware

of the said plan. Eventually certain robbed items were

recovered from the posseSSIOn of the 3rd Accused-

Appellant.

It is the contention of the counsel for the 3rd Accused

-Appellant that the Learned High Court Judge had

imposed a such sentence as the accused- Appellant was

absent at the trial.

On 31.07.2012 the 1 st ,2nd ,4th , and 5th accused

persons withdrew their earlier plea and pleaded guilty

to their charges respectively.

It is seen from the proceedings that the Learned High

Court Judge had considered the plea of the above

accused, imposed a sentence of 24 months RI

suspended for 10 years and a fine of Rs.7,500/

carryIng a default sentence

Imprisonment.

Learned High

has taken the following

facts In to consideration, in that;

The nature of the charge against them, the period of

incarceration, at the outset having pleaded for the

charge, and without prevIOUS convictions. It IS pertinent

to note that the 3rd Accused-Appellant were also

charged with the same offence for retaining stolen

property. It IS contended by the Learned Counsel for

the Respondent that the Learned High Court Judge

had directed a non custodial sentence for the said

accused persons purely on the grounds as stated

4

! I I ! f 1 ! t i I I ! f I

above. Therefore it is the contention of the Respondent

that the 3 rd Accused- Appellant does not deserve a non

custodial sentence due to his contumacious behaviour.

It 1S contended by the Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant that the

considered with the

3rd Accused - Appellant should

sentence that was imposed on

be

the

1 st 2nd and 5th accused who stood for the same charge

as the 3rd Accused - Appellant.

Respondent also asserts the fact that the Learned High

Court Judge has before arnv1ng at the above

determination has taken 1n to account the fact that

the 3rd Accused non appearance 1n court.

It 1S evident that the police had recovered about 10

items of gold from the 3 rd Accused - Appellant's

possesslOn.

Therefore it 1S contended by the Respondent that the

Learned High Court Judge has correctly assessed the

facts 1n the proper perspective and same should be

affirmed.

The Respondent has also adverted this court to the

judicial decision of DON PERCY NANAYAKKRA .VS. THE

REPUBLIC (1993) lSLR-71, wherein Their Lordships had

opined that "in assess1ng punishment the court has to

consider the matter from the point of both the offender

and the pUblic.

This Court will also take cognIsance of the rational

observed by Their Lordships in the case of THE KING

.VS. E.T.M. DE SARAM 42 NLR- 575, which held thus;

"the Court of Criminal Appeal will not interfere with

the discretion of the trial judge with regard to the

sentence unless that discretion has been exercised on a

wrong principle or unless the sentence IS manifestly

excessive" .

The counsel for the Accused -Appellant thrust his

defence mainly on the fact that the 1st accused who

stood In the indictment for the similar charge, and

who pleaded guilty to the same was imposed the

sentence of 24 months Rigorous Imprisonment which

was suspended for 10 years and a fine of Rs. 7500/

carryIng a default of 6 months imprisonment.

More fully the 2nd Accused who also pleaded to the

charge of retention of stolen property was imposed the

sentence as stated above, which IS a non custodial

sentence. Therefore it IS alleged by the Counsel for

the 3rd Accused-Appellant who stood for the same

charge has been sentenced to a sever punishment by

imposing a custodial sentence of 3 years of Rigorous

Imprisonment for retention of stolen property punishable

under section 394 of the Penal Code, and a fine of

Rs. 100,000/ as the other two accused who was

charged with the similar offence was imposed a fine of

Rs. 7500/. Besides a compensation of 2.5 million to be

paid to the SANASA Bank and In default of 5 years

imprisonmen t.

It IS salient to note that the 3rd Accused -Appellant

was arrested by the police and produced by the

pnson authority. Pursuant to the afore the Counsel for

the Appellant has made an application in terms of Section

241(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the

Learned High Court Judge made order rejecting the

application of the 3rd Accused - Appellant.

The Accused - Appellant being aggrieved by the said

order has appeal to this court to have the impugned

order set aside. The Pith and substance of the counsel

for the Accused- Appellant IS that the above sentence

is inordinately excessive In considering the circumstances

attended thereto.

It IS contended by the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant that the Learned High Court Judge has erred

law by . . In ImposIng a custodial sentence where as the

accused who were charged with same charge under

Section 394 for retention of stolen property was

imposed a non custodial sentence. In addition it IS

said the Learned High Court Judge has not ordered the

other accused who faced a similar charge to pay a

compensation of such an excessive amount. In fact they

were ordered to pay only Rs. 7500/ and with a

default term 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment. Hence a

cursory glance at the above, it exhibits clear disparity

In the sentences imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge who were charge with the similar offence, viz a

viz. Retention of stolen property. Therefore it is said the

above determination has caused miscarriage of justice.

To fortify the position stressed by the counsel for the

3rd Accused -Appellant, had adverted court to the to

the judicial decision in the case of HEWA FONSEKAGE

PRIYANI

"the 18t

be considered as an additional ground when imposing

the punishment."(emphasis added).

I t is been noted that the same VIew was appreciated

In the case of K.V. CHANDRASEKARA .VS. ATTORNEY

GENERAL (CA 153/2012) DECIDED ON 09.02 .2016 )

The counsel for the 3rd Accused- Appellant has dealt

with the applicability of Section 17 of the Civil

Procedure Code In dealing with awarding compensation

for the parties.

The Counsel for the 3rd Accused -Appellant alleged that

the Learned High Court Judge has not adhered to the

8

,

f , l ,

t I [ t i ! f, IIi t Ii ! l t I

f I f , ?

provlslOn of the Criminal Procedure Code VIZ; Section

291 (1) (d) which states thus;

"(d) The term for which the court directs the offender

to be imprisoned in default of a fine shall not exceed

one-forth of the term of imprisonment which IS the

maxImum fixed for the offence if the offence be

punishable with imprisonment as well as fine."

Therefore it IS the categorical position of the counsel

for the Accused - Appellant that as per Section 394

the maximum sentence is 3 years and In terms of

section 291 (1) (d) of the Criminal Procedure Code and

the default sentence for the fine that may imposed by

the court, shall not exceed Y4 of the 3 years.

Therefore

awarding

event of

the clear procedure to be followed

compensation and imposing jail term In

a failure to pay the fine IS fairly

In

the

and

squarely laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code as

stated above.

Hence In the wake of the above factual and legal

matrix this court is of the view that the Learned High

Court Judge has imposed a fine which was imposed

on the Accused persons who In fact were directly

involved in the robbery of the SANASA bank, and also

a jail term, merely because the 3rd Accused - Appellant

was absconding and trial proceeded under 241 of the

Criminal Procedure Code. As decided and it IS trite

9

that such fact cannot be taken In to account In

imposing the a sentence on the Accused- Appellant.

In the said back drop this court IS of the VIew that

there IS a disparity In the sentence imposed on the

accused persons who pleaded guilty to the same charge

as a parole was granted, where as the 3rd Accused-

Appellant was imposed a custodial sentence with an

exorbitant fine and inordinate amount of compensation,

which IS unreasonable and vexatious and should be

subject to the judicial review.

It IS being observed by the proceedings dated

26.10.2015 that the Accused-Appellant was produced by

the Prison Authority and a

behalf made submissions to

counsel appearIng on his

the effect that the above

Accused made a statement on 31.10.2002 to the

Acting Magistrate In terms of Section 127(1) of the

Criminal Procedure Code, and In fact he was to be

made a crown witness. It was at this stage that he

received death threats and as a result he has gone

to hiding for fear of death. Therefore the counsel has

moved court In terms of Section 241(3) to afford an

opportunity to the Accused - Appellant to explain reasons

for his absence, which opportunity was rejected by the

Learned High Court Judge and has imposed the same

sentence that was imposed on the other accused who

pleaded guilty for the charge of robbery. This Court

Therefore 1n the above setting I am persuaded to

Appellant as follows;

2 years of Rigorous Imprisonment, suspended for ten

In addition Rs. 25,000/ fine carry1ng a default term of

1 year Simple Imprisonment.
