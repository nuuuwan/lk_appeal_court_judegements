Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The accused appellant in this case was convicted for raping a girl

named Anusha Janaki and was sentenced to seven years R1 and a fine

of Rs. 20,0001= and was also ordered to pay Rs. 75,0001= as

compensation to the victim.

The facts of the case may be briefly summarized as follows,

The victim Anusha Janaki was employed at the accused

appellant's restaurant at Mount Lavinia as a waitress. She has come to

work there seven or eight months prior to the said incident. On the days

she had to work late the accused who was her employer used to drop her Itoff at the boarding place. On the day the alleged incident took place

(04/07/1998) the accused appellant had taken her in a three wheeler to

her boarding house around 9 in the night and on the way has gone to a

house to collect some parcels and asked her to get off and help him carry

some parcels from the said house. The victim has gone inside the house

and into a room behind the accused. The act of rape was committed

inside this room. The victim Anusha Janaki had gone back for work to the

same restaurant after this day and has worked till the 20th of that month.

Thereafter she has gone home to Akuressa after staying in the boarding

for one month. She had fallen ill and the mother has taken her to a doctor

2

who found out that she was pregnant. After the mother threatened

Anusha Janaki she has told the mother that the boss raped her. The

mother has taken her to the police and made a complaint and later she

was examined by the Judicial Medical Officer. This statement was made

over four months (on 20/11/1998) after the incident.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued the grounds of appeal

as follows to mitigate against the maintenance of the conviction;

1. Credibility of the prosecutrix's evidence

2. Test of promptness and

3. Test of consistency and

4. Absence of corroboration

On the credibility of the victim's evidence the appellant states that

the tests of spontaneity, promptness, consistency and probability were

not adequately addressed. The learned counsel for the respondent stated

that the victim Anusha Janaki's evidence was corroborated by the Judicial

Medical Officer's evidence.

On the test of spontaneity the appellant's counsel submitted that

the statement to the police was made over four months after the incident

and that even to her mother after the doctor disclosed she was pregnant

she did not specifically state that she was raped and that the victim did

3

not spontaneously state she was raped by the accused appellant. The

respondent stated in reply that the test of spontaneity in a rape case

should be applied given the circumstances of the case. The girl is from a

poor home and a very young girl who had come to the city to work and

the shame of the incident was too much to bear and she kept it a secret

until she was found to be pregnant.

The accused appellant's counsel state on the test of consistency

the victim has stated to the police that the incident took place in a house

at Mount Lavinia next to the Lions Club Hotel whereas when she was

examined by the Judicial Medical Officer she has told that she was raped

at a restaurant in Ratmalana. The learned counsel for the respondent

argued that this disparity is explained by the police officer who went in

search of the place by stating that there are countless number of

restaurant and house used as restaurants down the Hotel road in Mount

Lavinia.

The victim Anusha Janaki in evidence has stated that she did not

go for work at the restaurant for three days after the incident. To

contradict this position the Attendance Register maintained at the

Peaking Palace was marked and produced as V1. According to which

Anusha Janaki has signed the register on the 5th , 6th and 7th of July and

4

she has admitted to court that the signature was hers. Therefore her

testimony in court that she did not go for work for three days after the

incident is not true.

In Ajith vs Attorney General 2009 1 SLR 23 and Sunil and

Another vs The Attorney General the importance of corroboration in a

rape case has been discussed. It was held in the above cases, that

corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible and if the witness requiring

corroboration is not credible his testimony should be rejected. The

respondent argued that there are many authorities in Sri Lanka which

states that in rape and sexual harassment cases it is not necessary to

look for corroboration. In the instant case the evidence of the Judicial

Medical Officer was brought in to corroborate the evidence of Anusha

Janaki.

The issue in the instant case is not of corroboration but that of the

lack of spontaneity and promptness in the evidence of the prosecution.

The victim Anusha Janaki told court that she did not go to work for 3 days

after the incident but later when V1 was produced she admitted that she

has signed the attendance register on those three days and that it was

her signature which appeared on the register. The complaint was made

5

to the police only after she found she was pregnant. This casts a shadow

on her evidence. If she was raped on the 04th of July beign a girl of such

tender years would she go back to work for her assailant on the following

day and keep quiet about the whole episode for months?

When giving evidence Anusha Janaki has said on the day of the

incident she was taken into a house by the appellant and when she

entered the house there was a man and a woman in the house and that

after entering the room the accused closed and locked the door.

In cross examination she says that,

When she was asked why she did not tell the mother about the

incident she has said that she was threatened by the accused appellant.

If so why did she go back to the same place for work after the incident?

It is hard to believe that a girl of such young age after been raped goes

back to the rapist to work and keeps silent for months till the mother finds

out she's pregnant! There was no spontaneous or prompt complaint. And

the evidence of the victim is not consistent. She has given different

answers when cross examined, on the incident and the delayed

complaint was explained by saying she was threatened by the accused

appellant. If so why did she go back to the same place to work after the

incident and continued to do so? I therefore hold that the story of the

victim that sexual intercourse was performed without her consent does

not satisfy the test of probability.

To establish a charge of rape it must be established that the

accused committed the offence on the woman and that the said act was

performed without her consent. If there is a reasonable doubt in one of

the above ingredients the charge should fail. The evidence show that

there is a reasonable doubt in the second ingredient. The learned High

Court Judge has failed to analyse the evidence applying the tests of

probability, reasonableness and promptness. Therefore this court has to

conclude that the charge of rape has not been proved beyond reasonable

doubt.

,

The accused appellant is then entitled to be acquitted. In a charge

of rape if the evidence of the prosecutrix does not satisfy the test of

probability the court should reject her evidence and acquit the accused

appellant.

Appeal allowed. Judgment of the High Court dated 02/06/2010 is

set aside. Accused appellant is acquitted.

I agree.
