Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J (P I CAl

Petitioner to the present application QEG Lanka Private Limited has come

before this Court seeking writ of certiorari quashing the decisions or

orders purported to have taken by the 2nd respondent which are produced

marked before this Court marked P4, pg and pgE. As revealed before this

Court the 4th respondent Noel Willem Roets a South African National had

been employed as the General Manager of QEG Group and the position

taken up by the petitioner was that the 4th respondent was not an

employee of the petitioner but was an employee of QEG Singapore Private

Limited. The complaint of the petitioner before this court was that the 18t

1

and /or the 2nd and /or 3rd respondents after holding an inquiry under

the Provisions in Section 53(3) of the Shop and Office Employee Act had

made order directing the petitioner to pay sum of Rs. 11481000/- as

remuneration due to the 4th respondent. The petitioner's main argument

before this Court was based on the service agreement said to have signed

between the employer and employee on 1 st of March 2013 which is

produced before this Court marked Xl attached to P3 and a document

said to have signed by the Chief Executive Office QEG Singapore Private

Limited which is produced marked X2 attached to P3. While submitting

the said documents, the petitioner took up the position that it is the

director of QEG Singapore Private Limited who has signed Xl as the

employer and thereafter when the salary which was due to the 4th

respondent went in arrears the chief executive officer of QEG Singapore

has admitted the liability by X2. Based on the said two documents the

petitioner argued that the findings of the 1 st -3rd respondents were

reached without sufficient material before them. The petitioners have

further taken up position that the 1 st -3rd respondents have failed to give

reasons in their impugned decisions and the said failure by the 1-3

~ respondents is a violation of ruletnatural justice.

However, when going through the material placed before us it is observed

by this Court that the document Xl which is said to be the employment

contract of the 4th respondent, the employer is referred as QEG Lanka

Private Limited. Page one of the employment contract refers to the two

2

parties as 1. QEG Lanka Private Limited and, 2. Noel Willem Roets. In

page two the parties referred to as QEG Lanka Private Limited

incorporated and registered in Sri Lanka with Company No. PV88865

whose registered office is at 40A, Lower Dickson, Galle Sri Lanka and the

second Party Noel Willem Roets the South African Notational with

passport No. 45373456Iof Mina Al Arab Apartments, Ras Al Khaimah

UAE. By document produced marked PI the certificate of incorporation of

QEG Lanka Private Limited confirms that it is a registered company in Sri

Lanka. It is futher admitted before this Court that the mother company of

this Sri Lankan Company QEG Lanka Private Limited is QEG Group.

When looking at this documents, it is further agreed in page IO that any

dispute or claim arising out of or connection with it or its subject matter

or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the

laws of Sri Lanka. When looking at the above provisions of the

employment contract it is clear that the employer of the 4th respondent is

none other than the petitioner and therefore this Court is not inclined to

accept the argument placed by the petitioner before this Court. The fact

that the CEO of QEG Singapore accept the liability of the payment of

salaries does not take)j1 this case any further since it was admitted

before this Court that the petitioner company belongs to a group called

QEG Group. However the employer employee relationship with regard to

the 4th respondent is between the petitioner and the 4th respondent. As

observed above by document X2 the QEG Group had admitted the none

3

payment of remuneration to the 4th respondent for the period between

May and December 2013. As submitted before tis Court the agreed

remuneration for the 4th respondent was 12000 US $ per month and

there is an arrears of salaries for the month of May 5000US $ and June to

December 84000US $ totaled in to 89000 US $. The next matter to be

decided by this Court is whether the 1 st -3rd respondents have given a fair

opportunity to the petitioner when conducting the inquiry under Section

53(3) of the Shop and Office Employees Act. In this regard the learned

Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the said respondent brought to our

notice ~ the document which is produced marked P2 by the ~ petitioner himself. By the said document P2 the petitioner was informed

of a complaint received by the 4th respondent and a date had been fIxed

for the inquiry as 24.02.2014 at 2.00 p.m. and a copy of the said

complaint of the 4th respondent was also attached. As observed by this

Court the attached document gives a clear description of the complaint

made against the petitioner. As submitted by the learned senior Deputy

Solicitor General, petitioner was absent at the inquiry which was fIxed for

24.02.2014. The said inquiry was re-fIxed for 05.03.2014 but even on that

date the petitioner was absent. The matter was thereafter taken up for

inquiry with fresh notice to the petitioner on 19.03.2014 on which date

the Human Resource Manager of the company represented the company

and moved for a date to retain a counsel. The inquiry was then fInally re-

fIxed for 2nd April 2014 at 3.00 p.m. However the petitioner was not ready

4

for the inquiry on that date but an application was made on behalf of him

for a postponement. Since it was fIxed fInally the for that date, 2nd

respondent decided to continue with his inquiry and made his order on

that date. When making the said order as submitted by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General there was ample material before the 2nd

respondent for his conclusion since the complaint made by the 4th

respondent which was annexed to the original notice had given the details

of the dispute between the petitioner and the 4th respondent suffIciently.

However, when the decision of the said inquiry was communicated to the

petitioner by P4 on the 02.04.2014 the petitioner submitted an appeal

before the 18t respondent and requested an opportunity for him to make

representation on behalf of him. Even though there is no legal

requirement under the provision of the Shop and OffIce Employee's Act

the 18t respondent to give an opportunity to a default party, the 18t

respondent had acted fairly and granted an opportunity for the petitioner

to submit his case before the commissioner. The documents before us

reveal the fact that the petitioner was given an opportunity to submit his

position once again by the 18t -3rd respondents and the petitioner had in

fact fIled his written submission also before the respondent for their

consideration. Subsequent to the hearing of the appeal the 3rd respondent

has once again taken his decision and his decision was conveyed to the

petitioner by P9 and P9A. As observed by this Court the respondents

have given ample opportunity to the petitioner to submit his case before

5

them and after gIvmg due consideration had reached final decision to

direct the petitioner to pay arrears of salaries for the period of May 2013

to December 2013 which will come to Rs. 11481000/-. As submitted by

the learned senior Deputy Solicitor General it is clear that there was

ample material before the 1 st -3rd respondents when they reached the said

decision and therefore we see no reason to interfere with the said findings

at this moment. We therefore, decide to dismiss this application with cost

fixed at Rs. 25000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
