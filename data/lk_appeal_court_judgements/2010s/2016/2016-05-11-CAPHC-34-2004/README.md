Malinie Gunaratne, J.

Pursuant to an information filed by the Balapitiya Police in terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, the learned Primary Court

Judge held an inquiry into the dispute between 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents-

Petitioners - Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) and 1 st, 3 rd

and 4th Respondents - Respondents - Respondents ( hereinafter referred to

as the Respondents) in respect of the land called Kirillawela, held that he is

unable to make any order with regard to the possession of the land, as the

parties have not identified the disputed land properly and ordered to

3

maintain the statusquo until the rights are decided by the Partition action

already filed in the District Court.

Aggrieved by the said Order, Respondents sought to move in Revision

against the said Order by Revision Application No. 480/02, filed before the

High Court Balapitiya.

The learned High Court Judge disagreeing with the Order made by the

learned Magistrate, set aside the said Order. By that Order learned High

Court Judge handed over the possession of the land in dispute to the

Respondents.

The Appellants have now filed this appeal seeking to set aside the said

judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 12.02.2004.

When this case was taken up for argument on 18.05.2015 the

Appellants were absent and unrepresented although notices have been issued

on them and the registered attorney, on several occasions. Hence, the Court

heard only the arguments of the Counsel for the Respondents.

The contention of the Counsel for the Respondent was, m the

Magistrate's Court, the Respondents had very clearly stated details about

the property involved in the dispute. Specially in the schedule of the

Affidavit which they had filed, the Respondents had clearly shown the

details and the boundaries of the property in dispute. In addition, Grama

Niladari of the area had testified in Court and clearly identified the land in

dispute. The Counsel's contention is accordingly that the Order of the

learned Magistrate is erroneous.

In an inquiry where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part thereof it shall be the duty of the judge of the Primary Court to

determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part thereof on the

date of filing of the information under Section 66 and make order as to who

is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof. But where a forcible

dispossession has taken place within a period of two months immediately

before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he may

make an order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to possession

prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent Court.

In the instant case the Primary Court Judge's view was, as the parties

had not been able to identify the land in dispute he is unable to make any

order under Section 66( 1 )(b) of the Primary Court Act and ordered to

maintain the statusquo until the rights are decided by the Partition Action

filed in the District Court.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Order of

the learned Magistrate is erroneous and against the said order the

Respondents sought to move in revision, and the learned High Court Judge

set aside the Order made by the learned Magistrate and decided to hand over

the possession of the land in dispute to the Respondents.

On perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is

apparent that the learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration the

affidavits and documents filed by both parties and has come to the aforesaid

conclusion.

Further, I do not see any wrong in the manner in which the learned

High Court Judge has considered the facts and the way in which she has

applied the law in this instance.

F or the above stated reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the Order

made by the learned High Court Judge. Therefore, I affirm the Order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 12.02.2004.

Appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P.R.Walgama, J.

I agree

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
