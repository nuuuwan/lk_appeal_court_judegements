constructive possession and she was dispossessed by the Respondents. The

Learned High Court Judge reversed the order of the Learned Magistrate

mainly on the basis that there was no evidence to establish the constructive

posseSSIOn.

The validity of the sub lease given by the original lessee, the foreigner,

is a matter to be decided by a competent civil court. For this application, the

person who had the legal possession, the foreigner, had handed over the

posseSSIOn to the Respondent. Once the Appellant had handed over the

posseSSIOn to the lessee and he had handed over the possession to the

Respondent, the Appellant cannot claim constructive possession through the

lessee. On the other hand there was no evidence what so ever to show that she

had the control of the premises. Therefore, it is not possible for the Appellant

to say that she was in constructive possession of the premises.

It has been held in the case of Iqbal v. Majedudeen and others [1999] 3

Sri L R 213 that;

1. The fact for determining whether a person is in possession of any

corporeal thing, such as a house, is to ascertain whether he is in

general control of it.

2. The law recognizes two kinds of possession:

(i) When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a

given time - actual possession.

(iiJ When he though not in actual possession has both the power

and intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control

over a thing either directly or through another person -

constructive possession.

4

3. 'Forcibly dispossessed' in s. 68 (3) means, that dispossession had

taken place against the will of the persons entitled to possess and

without authority of the law.

In the case before us, there was no evidence to show that the Appellant

had any sort of control over the premises in question. Therefore there is no

constructive possession established by the Appellant.

Under these circumstances, there is no any reason to interfere with the

findings of the Learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed. I order no costs.
