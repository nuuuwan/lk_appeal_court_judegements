The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the high Court of

Colombo under the allegation of possession of 14.02 grams of

Heroin punishable under Section 54 't ('tI) of the Poison Opium

and Dangerous Ordinance. After trial the accused-appellant

was convicted and sentenced for life imprisonment.

At the argument of this appeal learned Counsel for the

appellant strenuously contended that the learned trial judge

has erred in law by perusing the notes of the information book

while delivering the judgment. Learned Counsel relied strongly

on the following judicial decision :-

Sheela Sinharage Vs. The Attorney General 1885 (1)

SLR 1

Banda and Others Vs .Attorney General 1998 (3) SLR

I have given my mind to the rule of law enunciated in the

above judicial decisions. I hold that the decision in the above

case has no application whatsoever to the issue which arises

in the instant case.

The rule of law enunciated in the above judicial

decisions is that a trial Judge cannot use the matters recorded

at the non-summary inquiry or matters recorded in a police

statement as substantive evidence. In the instant case, the

learned trial Judge has not used the notes of the information

book as substantive evidence.

Reference is made to page 301 of the judgment.

Upon perusal of the above passage, it is perfectly clear

that the learned trail Judge has not used the material

contained in the information book as substantive evidence.

Therefore, it is wrong for the appellant to suggest:-

1. That the learned trial Judge has used the

The wording of the judgment at Page 301 IS perfectly

clear to me. The learned trial judge held '

What is crystal clear from the above passage is that the

learned trial Judge has held that after a considerable lapse of

time it is customary to come across contradictions in the

testimony of a witness. The conclusion is wholly legal and

justifiable in law. Arriving at determinations with regard to

credibility and testimonial trust worth sum of a witness is a

question of fact ; See : Wickremasooriya V Dedoleena and

other 1996 SLR Vol. (2) Page 95.

In the case before me, the learned trial Judge, applying

the test of credibility and test of testimonial trustworthiness,

has very correctly relied on his knowledge of men and matters

and has correctly held that when proceedings are led long

after the events spoken to by witness it is customary to come

across contradictions.

I wish to emphasis that the learned trial judge has not

used the contents of the information book to evaluate the

credibility and evidential trustworthiness of the witness.

Thus, I reject the argument advanced by the counsel for

the appellant as devoid if any merits.

I wish to add that in the case of Attorney- General

Viswalingam 47 NLR 286 Justice Cannon stressed that the

trial judge should direct his mind specifically to the issue

which contradictions are material and without contradictions

are not material before the proceeds to discredit a testimony

of witness. In the case before me, the learned trial Judge has

very correctly the procedure that was expounded by Justice

"cannon" in a similar contest, justice. In a similar contest,

Justice Collin Thoms in Jagathsena V. Bandaranayaka 1984

(2) SLR 39, in considering the issue of contradictions inter-

se of the testimony of two witnesses, emphasized that the trial

Judge should probe the issue whether the discrepancy is due

to dishonestly or defective memory or whether the witness

power of memory are limited.

In the case before me, the learned trial Judge has

correctly adopted the procedure laid down in the above case

and held that it is customary to come across contradictions

in the testimony of a witness after a considerably lapse of

time.

As I said earlier, arriving at detrminations with regard to

credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of a witness is a

question of fact and not a question of law. See;

Wickromasuriya Dedoleena ( Supra)

I hold that the learned trial Judge has arrived at strong

and tenable findings of fact and in the result, this Court has

no jurisdiction or power to interfere with the fmdings of the

fact of the learned trail Judge.

I wholly agree with the findings of fact reached by the

learned trial Judge.

In the result, I proceed to dismiss the grounds of appeal

of the appellant.
