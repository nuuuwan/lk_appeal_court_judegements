Therefore, her parents had sent her to the appellant to adopt her as their own child when she was seven years old. The appellant was married at that time but didn't have any children. So both appellant and his wife had adopted the victim as their own child and treated her well. The evidence given by the prosecution witness no. 3 (mother of the victim) also corroborates her evidence with regard to this fact.

At that time, the appellant was at a nearby (about 10 minutes away from their house) temple. So the victim had walked to the temple through the railway to convey the message to the appellant (about 6pm). At the temple, the victim had met the appellant and she had conveyed the message to him. Then the appellant had asked her to tell the aunt to plug it correctly and he will come later. So the victim had started to return home alone. While she was walking on the railway, the appellant had called her behind and asked her to come with him to pluck some 'nelli' (amla fruit) for aunt as she was pregnant those days (vide pages 59 and 60 of the brief). The victim had believed this as the aunt was actually pregnant and she knew that there are 'nelli' trees in that area of the woods. So she had gone to the woods ('maanakele')",

Then the appellant had removed his own trouser and he had put down the trouser and the under pant of the , victim up to her knees. After that, the Appellant had pressed his male organ against the female organ of the victim for about five to ten minutes and he had moved up and down while doing so. Through this whole process, the appellant was closing the mouth of the victim with one of his hands and he was warning the victim not to shout (vide pages 60, 61, 71, 72 and 73 of the brief). Anyway, according to the evidence given by the witnesses for the prosecution that was a place where no one would have heard any sound even if the victim had shouted (vide pages 75, 109 and 110 of the brief). When the appellant got up, the victim had noticed something in white colour at the place where the appellant committed the act. After everything was done the appellant had worn his trouser back and dressed up the victim too. Then he had warned the victim not to tell anything about this incident to anyone and if she does so she will not be able to go back home. Finally, the victim had come home and the appellant had gone back to the temple (vide pages 62 and 74 of the brief).",

It is evident in this case that the victim came to know something about sexuality and the danger that a female has from males only after she attended the 'health and physical science' class at school. This is a fact that we can agree with because, this victim didn't have her mother with her to teach her all these things and to warn or advice her.

However, it is evident that she had started to get close to the teacher and started to divulge the annoyances and ill-treatments that she experiences at her residence. Unfortunately the teacher had to leave the school at the same time period. The evidence given by the teacher corroborates these facts. However, even though the teacher's statement to the police is silent with regard to the appellant, she had stated in Courts that the victim had clearly stated to her that the uncle (appellant) had touched her body. Furthermore, the teacher, while giving evidence, had clearly stated that she felt that the victim was hiding something from her or in other words she had some more to tell her (vide page 91 of the brief).",

In the present case, the learned High Court Judge has well analysed all the evidence before him in his Judgment and accordingly he has not noticed any untrustworthiness of the victim's testimony. Furthermore, even though we can only come to a decision by going through the proceedings, we also do not see any untrustworthiness of the victim's evidence. Moreover, merely because the police did not receive any letter from victim or the investigations did not start as a result of the letter written by the victim to the police, we cannot say that the victim did not send such a letter or the appellant did not commit such an act. However, the victim had stated that she did not mention any of the incidents she faced in that letter but merely mentioned that she is unsafe at home. Therefore, the absence of this letter does not create a reasonable doubt which goes to the root of the case.",
