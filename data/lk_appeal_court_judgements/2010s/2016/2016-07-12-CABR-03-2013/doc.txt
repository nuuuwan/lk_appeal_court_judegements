The appellant Bank had filed this appeal under Sec. 28 of the Land

Acquisition Act no. 9 of 1950 (an amended) against an award of

compensation for a land acquired. The Acquiring Officer had awarded

compensation in respect of the land acquired in an order under proviso (a)

of section 38 of the Act as published in a gazette, after holding an inquiry

under sec. 9 of the said Act. The appellant had appealed to the Land

Acquisition Board of Review under sec. 22 against the said award of

compensation. The Board of Review after a long inquiry affirmed the award

of compensation. This appeal had been filed against the order of the Board

of Review.

The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the section 9

inquiry was held only on one occasion and the respondent did not call for

a valuation report to ascertain the market value of the acquired land or call

for any other witness. The Acquiring officer had awarded the appellant a

sum of Rs. Seventy four million as compensation for the acquired land.

The appellant's counsel stated that the material produced by them were

not considered and as to how they arrived at the amount of compensation

was also not stated.

The appellant submitted that they appealed to the Board of Review

against the said award and at the inquiry held valuer J.M.J. Fernando and

Assistant Director valuer Bandara gave evidence and said that he visited

the land in question and inspected the buildings before he prepared the

valuation report. He further stated valuer Bandara in his evidence admitted

that he did not visit the land before he prepared the valuation report.

Valuation report prepared by the appellant for the Board of Review inquiry

had been marked as A 1 and the deed of sale for a property close to the

land in dispute had been marked as A2. The appellant's argument was

according to these two documents the actual value of the property was

much more.

The appellant further submitted that the valuation report prepared

by the respondent taking into account that the said land is situated in the

high security zone should be rejected for the reasons that it was prepared

without a scene visit by the valuer. He further stated that the trees in the

land have not been taken into account.

The appellant argued that the Board of Review failed to hold a

proper inquiry in compliance with sec. 9 of the Land Acquisition Act and

failed to estimate the true market value of the land under the provisions of

sec. 45 (1) of the said Act thereby erred in law when delivering their

findings. The appellant stated that the Board of Review had taken into

account irrelevant considerations in determining the market value of the

acquired land and cited the judgment in Karunadasa vs Unique Gem

Stones Ltd 1997 1 SLR 256. In this judgment it stated that a party is

entitled to a reasoned consideration of the case which he presents and

4

that in the instant case the Board of Review did not give a reasoned

consideration.

The learned counsel for the respondent stated that the appellant did

not present to the Acquiring officer any legally permissible material that

could have been considered by him under the Act in order to decide the

market value in terms of Sec. 45 of the Act to award compensation. The

respondent stated that the claim was based on an alleged total outstanding

money due to the appellant Bank from a mortgagee who previously owned

the property, were claimed as compensation from the state. The

respondent stated therefore it could be clearly seen that there was no

valuation report from the appellant before the Acquiring officer at the

inquiry under sec. 9. He further stated that there was no disclosure of an

acceptable basis on which compensation could be decided under sec. 46

(1) (a) of the Act. He further stated that in the absence of any marked value

whatsoever to consider the condition report and the valuation report of the

government valuer to award compensation.

The respondents further argued that documents A 1 to AS were

submitted to the Board of Review by the appellants for the first time at the

inquiry they were not presented to the Acquiring officer. The respondents

stated that an appellate tribunal can not and should not consider fresh

5

~ \ I l I

j material in appeal if the party had failed to produce such material at the

initial hearing. Respondents cited the judgments in Heenbanda and

another vs Tikiri Banda 1984 1 SLR 69, Thalwatte vs Somasunderam

1997 2 SLR 109 and Simon Fernando vs Bernadette Fernando 2003 2

SLR 138. The respondents stated a question of law mixed with facts could

not be raised in appeal for the first time.

This is an appeal under section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act

against the award of compensation. The Acquiring officer has awarded

compensation in a sum of rupees seventy four million, which amount the

appellant had challenged before the Board of Review. The Board of

Review had affirmed the award and dismissed the appellant's appeal. The

instant application is against the said award. The appellant stated in their

submissions that no proper valuation was done by the Acquiring officer

and that their documents and evidence were not considered. The appellant

had only submitted the said documents to the Board of Review and not to

the Acquiring officer. The Board of Review after considering the evidence

and the documents had refused the appeal and affirmed the Acquiring

officer's award. This court can only decide on questions of law and

evidence have to be evaluated at the inquiry. The appellant's arguments

were all based on evidence and not on law. The documents A1 and A2

are documents to be considered under section 9 of the Act by the Acquiring

officer and not by this court under the Land Acquisition Act.

The appellant having failed to submit any material at the inquiry

under section 9 before the Acquiring officer had submitted new material

(A1 to AS) to the Board of Review in the appeal under section 22 of the

Act. It is trite law that an appellate tribunal can not consider fresh material

in appeal if the appellant had failed to submit them at the initial hearing.

As submitted by the respondent in Heenbanda and another vs

Tikiri Banda it was held that a question mixed with facts and law can not

be raised in appeal for the first time. The same issue was decided in

Thalwatte vs Somasunderam and Simon Fernando vs Bernadette

Fernando where it was held once again that an appellant was not entitled

to present in appeal a case materially different from the case presented

before the trial court.

The orbit of the appeal under section 28 (1) of the Land Acquisition

Act is confined to the review of a decision of the Board of Review on a

question of law and what was not contested in the proceedings can not

form the subject of an appeal. No questions of law had arisen from the

determination of the Board for this court to decide. What was urged before

this court were matters of fact, which were not placed before the Acquiring

officer.
