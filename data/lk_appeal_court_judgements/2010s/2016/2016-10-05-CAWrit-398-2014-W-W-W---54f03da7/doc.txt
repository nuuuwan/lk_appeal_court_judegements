Heard Counsel for the petitioner and the Counsel for the

respondents.

The 1 st and 2nd petitioners have come before this Court with regard

to a land which is shown in the document P6 which had been identified as lot

34. According to the petitioners their father was in occupation in lot 46 which

is on the Southern Boundary of the lot 34. Lot 34 was occupied by one K.K. M.

Perera and the petitioners' father had purchased 3 acres from the said lot 34

and the said 3 acres were divided among the two petitioners 1 acre and 2 acre

respectively. The two petitioners have received annual permits with regard to

the said two lots in the year 1981 valid for a period of one year. The balance

portion oflot 34 was sold by the said KKM. Perera to the 5th respondent. It is

evident before this Court that the 5th respondent too had got an annual permit

for the said portion thereafter. However, in December, 1982 the 5th

respondent had received a Presidential Grant with regard to lot 34. The 5th

respondent said to have filed a District Court action to eject the 1 st and 2nd

petitioners from the said portions in the year 1988 and they have been

litigating since then before the District Court, High Court and the Supreme

Court. As observed by this Court the Supreme Court had finally dismissed

the appeal preferred before the Supreme Court by the 1 st and 2nd petitioners

on 23.07.2013. As observed by this Court the petitioners were well aware on

the grant made to the 5th respondent when the District Court case was filed

in 1988. Even though they have been litigating, the petitioners have not

decided to come before this Court by way of a writ application. At the same

time we observed that there was no valid permit issued to the 1 st and 2nd

petitioners at the time the grant was made in December 1982, since the

permits were issued to the 1 st and 2nd petitioners were valid only for one year

even though the petitioners have relied on an endorsement made on PI and P2.

In considering these factors we see no reason to issue notices in this case. We

therefore refuse to issue notices. No cost is ordered.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P.PADMAN SURASENA, J.

I agree.
