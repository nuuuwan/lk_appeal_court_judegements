Preliminary Plan PPG 3314 (CA/writ/163/2013)

2. Grant and issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the order under section 38 (a) of the Land

3. Grant and issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the order under section 38 (a) of the Land

Acquisition Act published in the Gazette marked P-4 in respect of Lot Nos 13,9 and 5 in

Preliminary Plan PPG 3314 (CNwrit/166/2013)

4. Grant and issue a writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to divest the land

under the Land Acquisition Act.

Since the three applications referred to in this judgment have filed, challenging the steps taken

under the Land Acquisition Act to Acquire Lands belonging to the Petitioners who lived in the

same area, and the impugned decision challenged before this court was referred to in one and the

same order, the parties agreed to argue all 3 cases together and obtain single judgment for all

three cases.

As revealed before us the Petitioners in CN Writ/163/2013 were the owners of premises at Nos

171,117 and 129 Hirimbura Cross Road, Petitioners in CN Writ/164/2013 were the owners of

premises at Nos. 169,121,131 and 181 Hirimbura Cross Road and the Petitioners in

CNWrit/166/2013 were the owners of premises at Nos. 189 and 189A Hirimbura Cross Road

and the Petitioners have filed their title deeds in support of their position.

As submitted by the Petitioners in the year 1998 on the direction of the then Minister of

Agriculture and Lands the then Divisional Secretary- Galle Four Gravets Divisional Secretariat

had published a notice under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, that the premises referred to

above are required for a public purpose along with other adjoining land.

Thereafter by notice published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1117/20 dated 3rd February 2000

the then holder of the office of the 1st Respondent made order under section 38 (a) of the Land

Acquisition Act ordering the Acquiring Officer to take immediate possession of the said Lands.

6

The Petitioners took up the position before this court that when the said notice under section 38

(a) was published the Petitioners objected to the acquisition on the basis that,

a. The public purpose for which their lands were being acquired was not set out.

b. No development plan/scheme was published or exhibited despite several meetings

and discussions with the predecessor's in office of the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents

c. The entire acquisition process was arbitrary and unreasonable

d. In any case there was no urgency meriting an order under section 38(a) of the Land

Acquisition Act.

As observed by this court the Petitioners after raising the said objections for the acquisitions

referred to above had taken several steps to canvass against the acquisition. This fact is revealed

before this court from the several documents filed by Petitioners along with their pleading.

When the Petitioners made representations to several authorities, the said authorities had looked

in to the said representation and called for several meetings between the Petitioners and the said

authorities in order to resolve the issue.

As revealed by the documentation before this court no decision was taken by the authorities to

divest the lands already acquired but the following proposals were forwarded to the Petitioners

for their considerations.

a) Payment of compensation to the market value

b) A new houses to be provided from Dadalla area

c) Those who had business premises, to provide them with temporary shop premises and

grant of a shop premises from the proposed commercial complex on monthly rent

basis.

7

While the said discussions were in progress, specially with the 4th Respondent, the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents had proceeded with the other requirements of the Land Acquisition Act and Section

7 notice too had been publishes in the Gazette Extraordinary 1390/12 dated 2ih April 2005.

According to the Respondents, the 4th Respondent, had decided to allocate Rs. 46185000/- as

compensation to be payed to the 0.7352 Hectares acquired from preliminary plan PPG 3314

under section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act and the said money had been now deposited for

the payment of compensation among the owners of the lands referred to above.

The Petitioners main arguments before this court was based on the failure by the Respondents to

disclose the Public purpose for which the Land was to be acquired, which would be fatal to the

acquisition proceedings taken place.

Section 2.2 of the Land Acquisition Act which refers to the notice reads thus,

"the notice referred to in subsection (I) shall be in Sinhala, Tamil and English Languages

and shall state that land in the area specified in the notice is required for a public purpose and

that all or any of the acts authorized by subsection (3) may be done on any land in that area in

order to investigate the suitability of that land for that public purpose."

The Petitioners have produced the section 2 notice published with regard to the acquisition

referred to above and this court would like to refer to some parts of the said notice which reads

thus;

"Having been duly directed by the Minister of Agriculture and Lands under sub-section

(1) of section 2 of the Land acquisition Act, as amended by the Land Acquisition (Amendment)

Act No 28 of 1964 I hereby give public notice as required by subsection (2) of that section that

land in the area described below is required for a public purpose;

8

Schedule

The allotment in extent of about 1 liz acres of land shown in the plan attached here with to the

application No. 12-2-4-LA-1082 of 05.01.1998 of Housing and Urban Development Secretary

which is situated in the village of Karapitiya in the Grama Niladhari Division of Deddugoda

North, Divisional Secretary's Division of Galle Four Gravets. The boundaries are as follows;

When going through the section 2, notice referred to above, in the body of the notice there is

reference to the purpose of Acquisition as, '-Public purpose" but no specific reference was made

as to what was the public purpose referred to above but, in the schedule referred to the said

notice, reference is made to an application No. 12-2-4-LA-1082 of 05.01.1998 by Secretary of

Urban Development.

However when considering their argument, this court observes that the Petitioners heavily relied

on the decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Manel Fernando and another Vs. DM.

jayarathne Minister of Agriculture and Lands and Others [2000J 1 Sri LR 112 where

Fernando J had observed, "In my view the scheme of the act requires a disclosure of the public

purpose and its object cannot be fully achieved without such disclosure."

The Petitioners have further relied on the Supreme Court decision in Mahinda Kulatunga V.

Minister of Lands and Land Development and Others [2008J 1 Sri LR 285 in which their

Lordships have decided to follow the decision in Manel Fernado's case.

Since their Lordships have repeatedly decided that the scheme of the act requires the reasons

being given when steps are being taken to acquire property for public purpose under the

provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, this court, would like to first analyze the decisions

referred to above and consider the circumstances under which the said decisions have reached.

L

9

In the case of Manel Fernando and Other Vs. D. M. Jayarathne Minister of Agriculture and

Lands and others, Fernando J had referred the circumstances under which the impugned

decisions has published as follows;

"The Petitioners stated that the 2nd Petitioner is a Ceylon Tamil from Balangoda married

to a Sinhala lady. The 2nd Petitioner purchased that land (which contains a substantial house as

well as a small rubber plantation) in September 1995 for Rs. 500,000. He raised the purchase

price by using his lifelong savings, by pawning jewellery, and by obtaining loans. In October

1995 the 2nd Petitioner and the members of his family went into occupation. A few weeks

thereafter the 2nd Respondent, the Grama Sevaka of Henagama, with a team of police officers

from the Horana Police Station came to the house and checked all their identity cards; the 2nd

Respondent informed the 2nd Petitioner that he suspected that the 2nd Petitioner was a terrorist;

and one of the Police Officers said that in the event of a soldier or police officer being killed in

action and his body being brought to the village, the first house that would be burnt would be the

2nd Petitioner's. Thereafter the 2nd Respondent came with police officers on many occasions and

harassed the 2nd Petitioner and the members of his family, making allegations that they were

terrorists. On one occasion, when there was a visitor in the house, the 2nd Respondent had come

with police officers and stated, in the presence of the visitor, that any person, other than the

members of the household, could enter the premises only with prior permission from the police

or himself. Humiliated, the visitor went away, all this compelled the 2nd Petitioner to take up

residence elsewhere, although he continued to come to the house regularly to look after his

rubber plantation and other cultivations. But as he was prevented, as aforesaid, from enjoying his

property, he could not repay the loans he had taken, and he was therefore compelled to advertise

the land for sale on 14.07.96 in the Sunday newspapers."

10

The Petitioner's affidavit went on to state that some of the prospective buyers complained that

the 4th Respondent Govi Niyamaka of Henagama,

"had waylaid them and said to refrain from purchasing the house as there were plans to

acquire this property. At that time there were no plans whatsoever to acquire this property but the

2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents connived and instigated a conspiracy to request the Government to

acquire this property. A few days thereafter the 3rd Respondent sent letter dated 19.07.96 ['P6']

to the 5th Respondent who is the Member of Parliament and S.LF.P organizer of the area

[requesting] his recommendation for acquisition ..... "

"It was not disputed at the hearing that the question whether the Petitioners' land was required

and was suitable for a Govi Sevana Centre was a matter for the Commissioner. However, the

available evidence shows that there was no request originating from the Commissioner, or with

his knowledge or approval, and that he gave no direction for the inspection of the land ....... "

"By letter dated 18.04.97 the assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Kalutara, informed

the 2nd Petitioner's wife that the Commissioner had directed to inquire into her objections to the

acquisitions. The 2nd Petitioner averred that he and his wife attended the inquiry on 02.05.97; that

they received a good hearing; and that the Assistant Commissioner informed the 2nd Petitioner

that he would not recommended the acquisition as it be unreasonable to acquire that property.

The 3rd Respondent had no personal knowledge thereof and could not have controverted those

averments. On the contrary, he stated that the Commissioner "has recommended to suspend the

acquisition after inquiry", and produced the Commissioner's letter dated 23.10.97 ['3R6'] to the

Secretary, Ministry of Lands. In that letter the Commissioner had recommended against

acquisition: thus in May itself the 15t Respondent must have known that the acquisition had not

been recommended. The Commissioner also requested that the acquisition proceedings be

11

suspended in accordance with section 50 of the Land Acquisition Act before the publication of

an order under section 38 .... "

Having discussed the above circumstances Fernando J had observed that,

"I hold that the 1st Respondent had no material on which, objectively, it could reasonably have

been concluded that the Petitioners' land was required for the stated public purpose of a Govi

Sevana Centre; that he did not bona fide think that it was so required; and that he had

misinformed the Hon. Prime Minister that the Commissioner had made a request for such

acquisition. Further, although no formal order had been made under section 4 of the Lands

Acquisition Act, an inquiry was held into the 2nd Petitioner's objections to the acquisition, after

which the inquiring officer (the Assistant Commissioner) had made a recommendation (which

the Commissioner had subsequently approved), that the land should not be acquired: and that the

1 st Respondent ignored or failed to consider. On the other hand, he placed undue reliance on the

5th Respondent's factors. I hold that in fact the Petitioners' land was not required for a public

purpose, and that the acquisition was unlawful arbitrary and unreasonable."

Similarly in the case of Mahinda Kulatunga V. Minister of Lands and Land Development and

Others apart from the other grounds of appeal raised before their Lordships, it was also raised as

one of the grounds of appeal, the failure to specify the public purpose in the notice given under

section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act.

In the said case Somawansa J, having considered the following facts revealed before their

Lordships to the effect,

"The applicant's mam contention is that the land belonging to him and which was

acquired has not been used for any public purpose although possession of the same was taken by

the 3rd Respondent in December1990 on the ground of urgency. That in or about January 2002 he

12

discovered that the 4th Respondent has been placed in possession of about 3 acres in extent

including the said portion of the land which belongs to the appellant and that the 4th Respondent

was placed in possession by the Urban Development Authority the 5th Respondent and that the

4th Respondent was taking steps to construct a private hospital and resort thereon. The appellant

contends that having taken possession of the property as far back as 1990 on the grounds of an

alleged urgent public purpose and having not developed the property and having failed to specify

the public purpose for which the said lands were purported to be acquired a third party was

filling portions thereof which had been handed over to the 4th Respondent for its private

purpose ...... "

"Through counsel for the Respondent contends that the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act does not require to specify the public purpose in the relevant notices and that

section 5 notice makes it conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose, I am

unable to agree with the aforesaid contention in view of the decision in Manel Fernando and

Another Vs. D.M. Jayaratne, Minister of Agriculture and Lands and Others where the Supreme

Court came to the conclusion that a section 2 notice must state the public purpose- although

exceptions may perhaps be implied in regard to purpose involving national security and the like.

At 125 per Fernando J.

"The first question is whether the public purpose should be disclosed in the section 2 and

section 4 notices.

The minister cannot order the issue of a section 2 notice unless he has a public purpose in

mind. Is there any valid reason why he should withhold this from the owners who may be

affected?

Section 2 (2) required the notice to state that one or more acts may be done "in order to

investigate the suitability of that land for that public purpose"; obviously "that" public

13

purpose cannot be an undisclosed one. This implies that the purpose must be disclosed.

From a practical point of view, if an officer acting under section 2 (3) (t) does not know

the public purpose, he cannot fulfill his duty of ascertaining whether any particular land

is suitable for that purpose.

Likewise, the object of section 4 (3) is to enable the owner to submit his objections:

which would legitimately include an objection that his land is not suitable for the public

purpose which the state has in mind, or that there are other and more suitable lands. That

object would be defeated, and there would be no meaningful inquiry into objections,

unless the public purpose is disclosed. If the purpose has to be disclosed at that stage,

there is no valid reason why it should not be revealed at the section 2 stage.

In my view, the scheme of the act requires a disclosure of the public purpose, and its

objects cannot be fully achieved without such disclosure. A section 2 notice must state

the public purpose- although exceptions may perhaps be implied in regard to purposes

involving national security and the like."

In the circumstances, it appears that the failure to specify the public purpose in section 2 notice

in respect of the appellant's lands is fatal to the acquisition proceedings."

When carefully analyzing the above decisions of their lordships it is clear that their Lordship

have considered the following important aspects of the said cases when reaching the said

conclusion;

a) Minister cannot order the issue of a section 2 notice unless he has a public purpose in

mind

b) Section 2 (2) required the notice to state that one or more acts may be done "in order to

investigate the suitability of that land for that public purpose"

14

C) Object of section 4 (3) is to enable the owner to subject his objection, where he need to

know the purpose him to submit his objections

However when considering the material revealed before this court I would like to make the

following observations, which in my view are relevant to reach a decision in the case in hand.

a) Even though the public purpose to which the land is acquired is not mentioned in the

notice issued under section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, there is reference to a plan

attached to application number 12-2-4-LA-1882 of 05.01.1998 Secretary of the Housing

and Urban Development in the schedule to the said notice.

b) In the said circumstances it is clear that the purpose to which the land is acquired is

referred to in the application by the Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development

and a plan too had been provided by the said Secretary.

c) Subsequent to the said section 2 notice was published, section 38 (2) notice had been

published by the predecessor to the 151 Respondent in the Gazette extraordinary 1117/2

dated 03.02.2000 and 3rd Respondent had requested the Petitioners to hand over the

vacant possession to the 3rd Respondent by letters dated 22.03.2000 and 25.07.2000.

d) Since then Petitioners have made representation to various authorities which is evident

from their own documents produced before this court marked P-15, P-18, P-18B-I and P-

21, there is clear reference to the purpose of the said acquisition as "Karapitiya New

Town Development" which is referred to in those correspondence.

e) As revealed before this court the Karapitiya New Town Development which included the

construction of the New Hospital, Cancer Hospital, Medical Faculty of the University of

Ruhuna, Nurses Training School have now been completed but the said development

work could not be completed due to the refusal of the Petitioners to handed over the lands

15

referred to these proceedings in order to construct a Mixed Development Project to

complete the New Town Development Plan.

t) Even though the Petitioners challenged the position taken up by the Respondents that the

proposed Mixed Development Project is an afterthought, since the plans referred to by

the Respondents have drawn in the year 2013, this court observes that, the main purpose

of the said acquisition had remained as "Karapitiya New Town Development." All the

necessary constructions to develop the Karapitiya New Town had come up in stages on

the availability of funds for the said construction work.

g) The petitioners even though written to several authorities and submitted appeals to them

but failed to establish

1. That the lands acquired were not submitted for the New Town

Development in Karapitiya

ii. There is alternate or more suitable land is available in the area for the said

New Town Development work

lll. That the Respondents acted in mala fide when identifying the lands

belonging to the Petitioners for the acquisition.

When considering all the matters referred to above it is my view that the facts and circumstances

of the case in hand are different to the two cases relied upon by the Petitioners referred to above

and therefore this court is not bound to follow the decisions in the said cases.

In the case of Senevirathne and Others V. Urban Council Kegalle and Others [2001J 3 SLR

105 the above position was once again looked into by this court when the Petitioners raised the

same objection along with several objections, whilst depending on the same Supreme Court

decision in Manel Fernando's case. However J.A.N. de Silva PICA (as he was then) whilst

Amaratunga J concurred with held,

16

"If the appellant has not been prejudiced by the matters on which he relies on the court

may refuse relief even though he has succeeded in establishing some defect. The literal or

technical breach of an apparently mandatory provision in a statute may be so insignificant as not

in effect to matter. In those circumstances the court may in its discretion refuse relief."

When considering the matters already discussed, I see no merit in all three applications before

this court. I therefore make order dismissing all three applications but make no order with regard

to cost.

All three applications are dismissed.
