ORDER PERTAINING TO THE APPUCATION TO EXTEND THE OPERATION

OF THE INTERIM REUEF

P Padman Surasena J

The petitioner in this application has sought from this court inter alia:

1. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the directive issued by the 2nd

Respondent for and on behalf of the 1st Respondent, directing the

Petitioner to honour the Repurchase Transactions entered into with

the 5th Respondent and the Master Repurchase agreement entered

into with the 4th Respondent. (These directives are contained in the

document marked P 29)

II. an interim order restraining the 1st - 3rd and 6th Respondents from

suspending the Petitioner from carrying on the business and activities

of a t:rimary Dealer, and! or cancelling the appOintment of the

Petitioner as a Primary Dealer until the final hearing and

determination of this application.

When this P-etition was supported in this court on 2015-08-21, on an ex

parte application made to this court by the Petitioner, this court has

granted the interim order as per prayer (e) of the petition for a limited

period of time. The said stay order was made valid only up to 2015-09-04

on which date learned counsel for the Respondents having appeared in

court had objected to the extension of the said interim order issued by this

court at the first instance.

Thereafter this court having afforded the opportunities for all the parties to

- . file objections and counter objections with regard to a limited scope of the

4

inquiry to be held to decide on the objection raised against the extension

of the said stay order, fixed the said inquiry for 2016-02-08 and 2016-02-

10.

Learned counsel for all the parties extensively made submissions before

this court on those two days, filed written submissions thereafter in

support of their respective arguments and then concluded the said inquiry.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner relied on two

grounds in the course of his oral submissions as to why this court should

extend the operation of the said interim order until the final determination

of this application.

Those two grounds are:

(i) that the 2nd Respondent has failed to hold an inquiry before he

decided to issue the directives contained in the document marked

P 29.

(ii) that the 2nd Respondent cannot and should not have issued such

directives in P 29 as this matter is in the hands of the

'Commercial High Court' in a case filed by the 4th Respondent.

In addition to the above two grounds learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner in his written submissions has taken up two more grounds as to

why he insist that the said stay order should be extended. They are set out

below as (iii) and (iv).

(iii) that there is a strong prima facie case made out by the Petitioner

for the issuance of a writ of Certiorari.

i I

\

5

(iv) that the Petitioner will have to face an irreparable loss and

damage to his reputation in case" this court decides not to extend

the said stay order.

At this moment the task before this court is only to decide whether this

court should extend the stay order until the final determination of this

application.

This court in the case of Duwearachchi Vs Vincent Perera (1984 (2) SLR

94) has laid down three principles which courts should consider when they

are called upon to decide the issuance or non-issuance of a stay order. This

has been followed in the case of Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC Vs

Maithripala Sirisena and others (C A Writ Application No. 336/2012- C A

Minutes 22.02.2013) also.

These principles are as follows:

(a) Will a final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is

successful ?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie ?

(c) Will irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to

either party ?

As has been mentioned before, the Petitioner has relied upon five grounds.

Out of these- five grounds, ground (ii) can stand alone without having any

considerable link to the other grounds. The other three grounQs namely

grounds (i), (iii) and (iv) are somewhat interwoven with each other. They

revolve around the facts of this case. Hence, consideration of ground eii)

first would be convenient.

The pending Commercial High Court of Colombo case No. HC

(Civil)/155/2015/MR, is an action filed by the 4th Respondent to recover the

money due to him from the Petitioner, under the Master Repurchase

Agreement marked P 6. A copy of tile plaint filed in that case has been

submitted to this court by the Petitioner marked P 20. Perusal of the

document l'TlC:trked P 20 clearly shows that other than the 4th Respondent

there is no other party to that action. Indeed the 4th Respondent is the

plaintiff and the Petitioner is the defendant in that case. It is clear that the

4th Respondent, whenever he wishes, can at any stage withdraw that

action. It is important to remember at this stage that what the Petitioner

has challenged in the instant proceedings before this court is a directive

issued by the 2nd Respondent marked P 29. It is equally important to

remember that it is only against the 1st to 3rd and 6th Respondents that the

Petitioner had asked for the interim order in the prayer (e) of his petition.'

1 Accordingly, interim order issued by this court operates only against those

Respondents. Be that as it may, it is prudent to pause this discussion at

this pOint and proceed to consider the rest of the grounds at this juncture.

Although this court has to limit the scope of this order only to the question

whether or not the interim order should be extended or not, it has become

necessary for this court to touch on at least some of the major facts

pertaining to this case as learned counsel for all the parties had not only

extensively addressed this court but also heavily relied upon those grounds

in this inquiry. Further, consideration of the above facts has become

necessary particularly to find an answer to the question as to where the

7

balance of convenience lies and also to ascertain whether there would be

any irreparable loss and damage caused to any party in this case.

The impugned transactions had taken place in the Government Securities

Market. The Government Securities Market in treasury bills and bonds

consists of the primary market and the secondary market. In the primary

market the public debt department of the Central Bank auctions treasury

bills and bonds through a competitive bidding process to primary dealers in

government securities. The secondary market for government securities is

open to all investors who can purchase or sell securities through primary

dealers.

No party can elect to be a primary dealer. It is the Central Bank which

decides who should be given a license to operate as a primary dealer.

Therefore the primary dealers are specialized institutions, licensed and

appointed by the Monetary Board to deal with Government Securities under

the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance and the Registered Stocks and Securities

Ordinance.

Section 5 of--the Monetary Law has established the Central Bank of Sri

Lanka as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and

regulation of the monetary, financial and payments system of Sri Lanka. It

is the duty of the Central Bank to secure and maintain economic and price

stability and financial system stability. In order to achieve this the Central

Bank has been entrusted the responsibility to issue from time to time

regulations and directions and codes of conduct with the view of having a

close supervision of the conduct of pr\mary dealers. It 1s 1n the course of

8

performing that duty that the 2nd Respondent has issued the directive

marked P 29 which is sought to be quashed by the petitioner.

It is important to bear in mind

(i) that the 1st to 3rd and 6th Respondents are obliged to regulate the

primary dealers in terms of the law to ensure that they act with

integrity at all times.

(ii) that neither this aspect nor the role played by 1st to 3rd and 6th

Respondents appear to be in issue in the Commercial High Court

case referred to above.

The petitioner and the 4th and 5th Respondents have entered into

repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements marked P 6 and P 9(a).

Pursuant to the said agreements the 4th and 5th Respondents have invested

a large amount of money with the Petitioner for the purpose of purchasing

treasury bills -and bonds. When a dispute had arisen between the parties

with regard to the returns promised, the Petitioner had unilaterally

withdrawn/unallocated the treasury bills and bonds purchased in the name

of the 4th and 5th Respondents. It is appropriate at this juncture to note

that what th-e 2nd Respondent has asked the Petitioner in the document

marked P 29 is, to honour the repurchase transactions entered into with

the 4th and 5th Respondents.

Learned counsel for the Respondent drew the attention of this court to the

relevant provisions of law in both the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance and

the regulations made there under to highlight the importance of

maintaining _~ close supervision by the Centra' Bank over the Primary

I

9

Dealers who have been appointed by the Central Bank to deal with the

transactions relating to local treasury bills.

As mentioned earlier it is not the wish of this court to decide at this

moment whether to quash P 29 or not. However, if the allegation against

the Petitioner is true, "restraining the 1st to 3rd and 6th Respondents from

suspending--the Petitioner from carrying on the business and activities of a

primary dealer, and/or cancelling the appointment of the Petitioner as a

primary dealer until the final hearing and determination of this application"

would only encourage other primary dealers also to refuse to honour their

obligations also to their customers. This will eventually lead to the general

public losing their confidence in the government securities market. That

will in turn make things difficult, if not impossible for the Government to

borrow the finances and cash requirements it needs to bridge its budget

deficits. This could in the long run even result in the collapse of the entire

economy of the country.

On the other hand there can't be ~n irreparable loss or damage to the

Petitioner because the dispute between the 4th Respondent is in the

Commercial High Court. If there is any money due to the Petitioner from

the 4th or 5th Respondent, such issues can always be sorted out in courts

by way of an appropriate action as has been done by the 4th Respondent.

Although in view of the above conclusions it may not be necessary for this

court to consider grounds (i) and (iii) relied upon by the Petitioner as set

out before, it would be relevant for this court to move on to make the

following obiervation,. They ara!

i,

\,

10

i. that there is no statutory requirement cast on the 1st to 3rd and 6th

Respondents to grant the Petitioner a hearing prior to issuing a

direction.

ii. that in any case the Petitioner was in fact given a hearing and an

opportunity of placing its side of this dispute, as has been

demonstrated by paragraph 52 of the written submission filed by the

learned DSG on behalf of the 1st to 3rd and 6th Respondents.

iii. that the Petitioner's grievance before this court is that the 1st to 3rd

and 6t~_ Respondents did not conduct a 'proper inquiry' as opposed to

'failure to conduct any inquiry'.

In view of the above observations it will suffice to state here that this court

has to restrain itself and be slow to accept and act upon the grounds (i)

and (iii) relied upon by the Petitioner. Indeed the arguments contained in

these grounds are grounds which this court need and should. consider

when it is called upon to decide whether the directive in P 29 should be

quashed or not. That stage in this case is yet to arrive.

Submissions have been made by learned counsel for the 4th and 5th

Respondents that the Petitioner has suppressed material documents from

this court in-order to abuse the court process in obtaining this interim relief

ex parte. There are sufficient other reasons for refusing to extend the stay

order. They have been already set out above. Therefore no necessity arises

for this court to move on to consider this aspect of the case at this stage.

In these circumstances this court is of the considered view that there is no

irreparable loss or damage which would be caused to the Petitioner in the

11

absence of the interim order of this court and the balance of convenience

of the parties to this dispute is clearly tilted in favour of the Respondents

and hence points to the vacation of the interim order. Further this court is

also of the view that it is to the economy of this country that any possible

irreparable loss or damage would be caused, if this interim order is

permitted to stand.

The Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure Rules 1990 in its Rule 2(6),

states that upon sufficient cause being shown an order for interim relief

may be vari~d or set aside by the same or another bench or Judge, as the

case may be-of the Court.

For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the interim order issued by this

court as per prayer (e) of the Petition should not be extended. The said

stay order must be vacated and dissolved forthwith. Registrar of this Court

should take steps to inform this decision to the 1 st to 3rd and 6th

Respondents immediately.
