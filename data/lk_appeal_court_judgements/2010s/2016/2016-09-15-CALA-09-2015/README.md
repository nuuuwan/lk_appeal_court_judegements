The instant order concerns an application for leave to

appeal made by the Defendants- Petitioners to have the

impugned order of the Learned High Court Judge

set aside The above said order was made on 4 th

November 2015, and Learned High Court Judge by

the afore said order In the case bearing No. Action

in Rem 3/2015 has determined that the application by

the Defendant- Petitioner, as per counter claim for an

order directing the Plaintiff to provide sufficient

security was rejected.

In order to appreciate the Issue involved In this

application which lies In a narrow compass, it IS

necessary to set out the relevant in brief infra.

In that it IS noted that the Court has issued a

That the Plaintiff charted the above vessel to load

the cargo to be discharged at the port of Colombo

which act commenced on 24.05.2014.

However due to a malfunctioning of the submersible

pump belonging to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation,

the discharge of the cargo came to a stand still till

the 11.07.2014 and repaIrs were done and was

suitable to discharge the crude oil.

That it was the position of the Plaintiff that it took

steps to instruct the owner of the defendant vessel

namely the 2nd Defendant to commence the releasing

of the cargo.

It is in the above context that the Plaintiff that the

Plaintiff filed an affidavit to lead a warrant of arrest

against the Defendant vessel and moved the Court to

arrest the defendant vessel.

The Learned High Court Judge has also adverted to

the fact that although the Plaintiff had made

arrangement a ship to ship transfer for the

remaInIng cargo has not materialized due to

negligence of owner of the cargo.

It is pertinent to note that at the time the plaintiff

supported the affidavit to lead a warrant of arrest

the Court too had observed the facts stated below;

that

in addition the CPC was ready to receIve the cargo

from 11.07.2014.

In view of the above the Learned High Court Judge

was satisfied with facts placed before him and made

order IssuIng a warrant of arrest and writ of

summons In Rem.

It IS being noted that after releasing the entire

cargo it was the position of the Defendant that the

Plain tiff has no claim thereafter and the vessel could

be released without any security. But nevertheless the

Court below has ordered Rs. US$ 600,000/ as

security prior to the release of the same.

The ground norm of the Defendant's position IS that,

as per the counter claim that the Defendants are

entitled to claim damages for the wrongful arrest of

the above vessel and urged the High Court to

make order that the Plaintiff to furnish security on

the defendant's counter claim.

To buttress the above claim the Defendants thrust

on the determination arrived at In the case of MV

KALYANI AND ANOTHER .VS. MUTIARA SHIPPING

COMPANY-(1998- 2 SLR- 105), wherein

observed thus;

His Lordship

"An order that security be gIven for a counter claim

for damages for a wrongful arrest where a pre

5

judgment security has been obtained ex parte, may be

unusual. But I do not think it to be fundamentally

contrary either to principle or to practice. Here we

are considering an arrest which IS alleged to be not

merely wrong but also malice" (emphasis added).

Hence considering the above determination the pith

and substance IS that the court before decides

whether it should order security on the counter claim

should be satisfied that the alleged arrest should not

only wrongful and illegal bout also malicious.

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge was of the

VIew that the facts of the above case differs from

the case In hand and cannot be followed the same

In deciding present Issue.

In the above factual and legal matrix it IS

abundantly clear that the affidavit to lead a warrant

of arrest is not made out of mala fide and malice.

The Learned High Court Judge In considering the

above facts was of the view that the above Issue has

to be decided only after the parties placed the facts

at the trial.

I t IS noted that the parties had formulated the

contentious Issues to be tried at the trial. Therefore

it IS apposite to decide the above Issue after the

trial.

6

In addition to the afore said the Learned High Court

Judge has also considered the facts stated herein

below;

That the owners of the Defendant's vessel have failed

to comply with the mandatory prOVISIons of the

charter party agreement, and both parties had taken

different positions as to the delay in discharging the

cargo, that the entire cargo was discharged only on

29.07.2014.

Further it IS observed that the owner of the

Defendant vessel was not contactable at the time of

supporting the affidavit to lead warrant of arrest on

21.07.2014, and there IS a possibility of CPC

claiming damages from the Plaintiff.

It is seen from the said impugned order the Learned

High Court Judge unflinchingly ordered that the

Defendant's application IS premature and as such

should stand dismissed.

When the said im pugned order IS reviewed In the

above back drop this court IS compel to arnve at

the irresistible conclusion that the application of the

Defendant IS devoid of merits, thus should be

dismissed.

Accordingly the application to leave to appeal IS

dismissed, subject to a cost of Rs. 10,000.

7

I t IS further here by ordered that the Learned High

Court Judge shall proceed with the trial and make

a determination accordingly.
