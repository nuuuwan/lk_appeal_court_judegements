The petitioner invoked the writ jurisdiction of this court vested under

and in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution seeking a writ of

Prohibition, Prohibiting the 1st Respondent from cancelling and/or

revoking and/or annulling the divesting order published in the

Government Gazette produced marked P11 dated 17.02.2006.

The Petitioner was the lawful owner of the land called Kongahawatta

alias Kahatagahawatta situated in the village of Pamunivila consisting in

extent of 1 Acre, 2 Roods and 4 perches as evidenced by document

produced marked Pl.

Page 3 of9

The Petitioner had constructed four buildings in which the school known

as Pamunivila Roman Catholic Mixed School was conducted.

(Hereinafter referred to as the said school).

The Petitioner states that the said school consisting of 1 Acre, 2 Roods

was vested under and by virtue of the provisions of Assisted Schools and

Training Colleges (Special Provisions) Act No.5 of 1961 as amended in

the State for the purpose of administration of the said School by the ! ! J

government. The Petitioner further states that in the year 1978 the

Government acquired another land containing an extent of 8 acres

situated one mile away from the said school and constructed a three

storied building in 1994, housing more than 24 classrooms with all the

facilities.

The petitioner contends that on completion of the said construction the

entire upper school from grades 6 to 11 of the Pamunivila Roman

Catholic Sinhalese Mixed School was shifted to the newly constructed

Pamunivila Maha Vidyalaya in or about 1995.

The Petitioner admits that classes for the years 3, 4 and 5 were

conducted in the premises of the vested school. The Petitioner's agent

Rev Father Ivan Perera who was the General Manager of Catholic

Schools has requested the 3rd Respondent to divest the vested property

by a letter dated 18.03.1998 produced marked P5.

It appears from the brief that after the exchange of some letters the

divesting order produced marked Pll was issued by the Document

marked Pl1. The Petitioner's complaint is that the 1st Respondent is not

authorized to take steps to effect a cancellation of the divesting order

produced marked Pl1.

The argument advanced by the Petitioner's counsel is that once the

statutory power to divest property under the provision of the Act No 8 of

1961 as amended is exercised by the 1st Respondent, he does not have

further power under the statute to revoke the said order as statute has not

granted such power. Thus, any purported decision made to revoke or

cancel the divesting order is void in law.

Thel st Respondent has submitted that his case rests on section 18 of the

Interpretation Ordinance. Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance is

as follows:

"Where by enactment whether passed before or after the

commencement of this ordinance, confers power on any authority

to issue any proclamation, order or any notification so issued or

made may be at any time amended varied rescinded or revoked by

the same authority and in the same manner, and subject to the like

consent and conditions, if any, or by or in whichor subject to which

such proclamation, order or notification may be issued or made."

The Petitioner cited a decision reported in 2001 ISLR 2008 where His

Lordship S.N Silva C.J dealt with a claim submitted by the auctioneer in

the proceedings instituted in the commercial high court of Colombo. The

second decision cited by the Petitioner Sivayanama and Another V s

People's Bank 2009 ISLR 180 deals with the Audi Alteram Partem

Rule. This court is of the view that those two cases have no application

to the case at hand.

The Petitioner submits that the effect of the S.18 of the Interpretation

Ordinance has been considered by the Supreme Court in Nadaraja

Limited V Krichnadasan 78 NLR 155. In this case the Supreme Court

held that:

"Where the Minister has duly made an order under section 4(1) of

the Industrial Disputes Act referring an industrial dispute for

settlement by arbitration he has no power to revoke the said order

of reference. "

It was further held that the rule of construction embodied in section 18

of the Interpretation Ordinance was not intended to apply to an order of

reference made under section 4 of the Industrial Disputes Act and cannot

be invoked to revoke or rescind the order of reference made in terms of

section 4 of the said act.

Counsel for the 1 st Respondent contend that the divesting order was

obtained by misrepresentation of facts and once the true position was

made known to him, he made an order cancelling the Divesting Order

marked P11.

Page 7 of9

In support of his argument he cited Methodist Tourist Association vs.

Minister of Hindu Resources and Others 2006 3SLR 85.

In that case, the Methodist Trust Association sought a Writ of

Mandamus against the subject Minister to divest the property in suit on

the basis that the school which was vested in the Crown in terms of Act

no. 10 of 1961 has ceased to function as the building which housed the

school was burnt down as a result of the communal riots of 1983. His

Lordship Justice Sri Skandarajah dealt with Section 10 of the Act No. 10

of 1961 and dismissed the application.

In James Perera vs Government Agent Kandy, notices were caused to

be published calling for the nomination and election of members to the

village committee by the Government Agent. Subsequently, he canceled

the same on the basis that Galaha Mixed School was not a convenient

Polling place for the Inhabitants of the Ward. It was held that the

Government Agent had the right to cancel the notices under section 15

of the Interpretation Ordinance.

This court is of the view that the decisions of those cases have no

application to the case at hand.

This court is inclined to agree with the argument of the Petitioner's

Counsel that Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance does not permit

the revocation of the order made to revoke the gazette notification dated

17.02.2006 produced marked P11.

For the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner's Application in terms of Prayer

(b) and (c) is allowed.
