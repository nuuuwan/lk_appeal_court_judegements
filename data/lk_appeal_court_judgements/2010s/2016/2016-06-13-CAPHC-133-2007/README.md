This is an appeal from an order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Badulla on a revision application filed against the order of the learned

Magistrate of Bandarawela. The facts of the case are as follows. The Ii I{

2

Bandarawela police filed information in the Magistrate Court under section

66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act stating that a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely due to a land dispute arisen between the First Party

Respondents - Respondents - Appellants (hereinafter called and referred to

as the Appellants) and the Second Party Respondent -Petitioner -

Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to as the Respondent). The

Appellants case is that they were in possession of the paddy field in question

and it was prepared for potato cultivation. The vegetable beds were prepared

and fertilizer was applied to plant potato seeds. On 23.01.2006 the

Respondent came with several others and disturbed his possession and

started preparing the land for paddy cultivation. They state that the 2nd

Appellant is the owner of the land and the 1 st Appellant is cultivating the

land with him. The Respondent stated that his father G.M. Madiris was

CUltivating the paddy field for about 50 years and after his demise, he was

cultivating. The learned Magistrate, after inquiry, pronounced the order in

favour of the Appellants. Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned

Magistrate, the Respondent presented a revision application to the High

Court of Badulla where the Learned High Court Judge set aside the order of

the learned Magistrate and pronounced the order in favour the Respondent.

This appeal is from that order.

The Appellants raised an objection that under section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act the Primary Court / Magistrate Court has no

jurisdiction hear and determine a dispute relates to a paddy land. The

learned Counsel for the Appellants cited the case of Mansoor and another v.

O.I.C. Avissawella Police and another [1991] 2 Sri L R 75. The learned

Counsel for the Respondent's view is that whether it is a high land or a

paddy land if the dispute leads into a immediate breach of the peace

(threatened or likely) the mere fact that the dispute is to be determined under

3

a particular Act does not preclude the Magistrate from making an order

under section 66(2) of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

Mansoor v. O.I.C. Awissawella (supra) is a case where the tenant

cultivator was evicted from the paddy land by the landlord. In that case S.N.

Silva CJ. observed that there is a question in the applicability of the Primary

Court Procedure Act when a specific law was enacted to protect the tenant

cultivators. His Lordship observed that;

The phrase "dispute affecting land" is interpreted in section 75 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act to include "any dispute as to the right

to the possession of any land. ........... or as to the right to cultivate any

land or a part of a land. .............. ". Therefore, ordinarily, the right of

a tenant cultivator to occupy and cultivate a paddy land would come

within the meaning of a "dispute affecting land". However, as noted

above, the status and rights of tenant cultivators of paddy lands is the

subject matter of specific statutory provi-sions. In contrast the

procedure in the Primary Courts Proce-dure Act is in the nature of a

general provision which applies in relation to every dispute affecting

land where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely.

The question to be decided in this application is whether a tenant

cultivator who is evicted from a paddy land can avail himself of an

order made by the Primary Court in a proceed-ing under Part VII of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act not-withstanding the remedy

provided to him under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Law

and later the Agrarian Services Act.

After considering several English authorities, His Lordship held that;

It has to be noted that there is specific provision in the Agricultural

Lands Law and the Agrarian Services Act which gives a right to a

tenant as against the landlord and any other person to use and

4

occupy the paddy land and to secure restoration of possession if he is

unlawfully evicted These provisions in the Agricultural Lands Law

and the Agrarian Services Act are in the nature of a special right and

a remedy for the infringement of that right. Therefore, I hold that the

machinery under the Agricultural Lands Law and the Agrarian

Services Act is the only one available to a tenant cultivator of paddy

land to secure and vindicate his tenurial rights. The general

procedure obtaining in Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

with regard to disputes affecting land where a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely, is not applicable in such a situation.

The case before us is not on an eviction of a tenant cultivator. The

Appellants state that the 2nd Appellant is the owner of the land by deed

marked A. According to the Appellants, they are cultivating their own land.

Disturbing their possession does not come within the meaning of evicting a

tenant cultivator. The Respondent's case is that his father cultivated the

paddy land for a long period of time and after his death, the Respondent

cultivated. He doesn't explain on what basis his father cultivated the land,

whether as the owner or as a tenant cultivator. The affidavit of the

Respondent as a whole, gives the impression that he is claiming the land as

the owner. His first statement to the police also leads to the same

conclusion. He said to the police that his father was the owner, and was

cultivating the land, and on his death, his mother became the owner, and on

her advice the Respondent started cultivating. As such, there is no eviction

of a tenant cultivator by a landlord. This is only a dispute in relation to the

possession of a land. The decision in the case of . Mansoor v. O.I.C.

Awissawella Police has no application to this case. This case can proceed

under Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act. I rule out the objection.

The Appellants' case is that they were in possession of this land. The

2nd Appellant claims that he became the owner of the land by the deed

5

marked A. The title is not a relevant fact in an application under section 66.

It is relevant only to prove on what basis he possesses the land. In the

present case, the Respondent stated in the statement to the police dated

23.01.2006 that his father G. H. Madiris was the owner but in his affidavit,

he is silent on the basis of the possession of him or his predecessor, his

father. He states that his father was in possession and with his demise, he

entered in to possession. The 2nd Appellant states that he, as the owner,

possessed the land. The Appellants has a stronger case than the Respondent.

In response to the First Appellant's complaint to the police that their

possession was disturbed by the Respondent on 23 rd January 2006, the

police made an inquiry on the same day and the Respondent's statement was

recorded. In that statement, he has stated that on the demise of his father,

his mother adviced him to prepare the land for paddy cultivation. This

proves that the Respondent was not in possession until his father's death.

The next question that has to consider is that whether the Appellants have

proved that they were in possession or whether the Respondent proved that

his father was in possession for the two months prior to the filing of the

information in the Magistrate Court.

After institution of this action, the Respondent made an application

ex=parte to the Magistrate Court and obtained an order for the police to re-

inquire the matter and to record the statements of several persons.

Consequences to this order, the police recorded statements and submitted a

report to the Magistrate Court. The Respondent is relying on those

statements to prove his case. Firstly the Respondent shouldn't have made an

application ex-parte after institution of the action. Once the action is

instituted, all applications must be made with notice to the opposing party

unless the law provided that an application can be made ex-parte. Part VII

of the Primary Court Procedure Act does not provide for an application of

this nature. It is the inherent power of the Court to do justice that gives

6

power to issue an order on this nature. Without giving notice, an application

should not have made. Secondly, the Court should not have issued an order

without giving a hearing the opposing party. The Appellants were denied

the opportunity of tendering the witnesses to the police officer to record

statements in his favour. Under these circumstances, there is no evidentiary

value of the statements made at the second inquiry.

The parties tendered certain letters issued by several persons in

support of their respective cases. These letters were prepared for the purpose

of this case. The authors of those letters are not before Court to testify to the

veracity of them. Even the witnesses, who submitted affidavits in support,

were not subjected to cross examination. The evidentiary value of these

documents is very low. The documents issued in the ordinary cause of

business have a higher evidentiary value than the documents specially

prepared for this case. The document marked as J and produced by the

Appellants is a certified extract of the Paddy Land Registry. It is an official

document prepared and kept in the custody of the Agrarian Service Center

Bandarawela. This registry is prepared in the ordinary cause of business.

Time to time paddy land registry is amended and it is done by the officials

after an inquiry. According to the document J, the last amendment was done

in 17.11.2004. Thereafter no amendment effected. This document indicates

that the 2nd Appellant is the owner cultivator of the land in question, which

proves that it was in the 2nd Appellant's possession. The 2nd Appellant has

paid the acreage taxes for the disputed land. The receipt marked B is for the

years of 2000/200112004/2005 paid on 22.08.2003 and the receipt marked C

is paid on 09.01.2006. These are also documents 'issued in the ordinary

cause of business. The Respondent was trying to say that these documents

were prepared for this case by the Appellants, but was unable to submit any

evidence to substantiate that proposition. The Respondent's father too had

paid taxes for the land, but it was several years prior to the filing of the

information under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act. The last

payment was in year 2004, but the 2nd Appellant has paid more recently, in

the year of 2006 but prior to the dispute being arisen. The possession

immediately prior to two months from the date of filing the information is

considered in these applications. Therefore the documents support the

Appellants case that they were in possession and the Respondent disturbed

them.

The Learned High Court Judge's conclusion was based on the

documents which were prepared for this case and the veracity was not

tested, but the documents prepared and maintained in the ordinary cause of

business speak otherwise. Therefore, I cannot agree with the learned High

Court Judge's findings. The learned Magistrate has considered the evidence

and has come to the correct finding.

Accordingly, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 13.09.2007

The appeal allowed with costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001-
