The petitioners have filed this application against the Respondents

seeking a Writ of Certiorari and a Writ of Prohibition.

The Writ of Certiorari is sought on a document which is part of the

Magistrate's Court record marked "P2" which is the certificate under which

proceedings were initiated in the Magistrate Court of Ruwanwella.

No writ of certiorari can be issued on the said document for the reason

that the said document was only a certificate filed in the Magistrate Court and

since then there has been supervening judicial order that is inforce.

If the petitioners had some grievance with regard to the certificate filed

by the 1st Respondent they could have, if at all, come to Court in the very first

instance available to them. They have not done so. They have waited till the

Magistrate acted on the said certificate and issued the order for ejectment to

come to Court.

Therefore, when this Petition was filed the certificate was no longer

operational or effective in law as the Magistrate has made an order which was

operational and effective.

It is trite law that an application for a writ of certiorari is available only in

respect of an order or decision which either imposes an obligation or involves

civil consequences to a person or alters his legal position to his disadvantage.

This has been held in several cases:

Vide: G.P.A. Silva and other vs. Sadiq and others - (1978/79/80)

volume 1 SLR 66 and Dayananda vs. Thalwatte - (2001) 2 SLR 73 at page 80

and Mendis Fowzie and others vs. Goonewardana, G.P.A. Silva -

(1978/79/80) volume 2 SLR 80.

With regard to the writ of prohibition the petitioners are seeking an order

restraining the respondents from acting on a judicial order to eject them. A

Writ of Prohibition is available only to prevent an illegal or unlawful or ultra

vires action by an administrative body. It cannot therefore apply when the

Respondents are acting to give effect to a judicial order'and so long as the said

order remains valid and lawful and has not been set aside by a higher court.

Any person who gives effect to or acts on the strength of a judicial order or acts

on the said order cannot be said to have acted illegally. Accordingly as the

Magistrate's order is valid, inforce and has not been set aside by a higher

courts no writ of prohibition will lie against the Respondents as prayed for.

Furthermore, the order of the Magistrate will be enforced not by the

Respondent but by the fiscal of the Magistrate's Court of Ruwanwella and the

fiscal has not been made a party to this case. With regard to the writ of

prohibition Lord Atkin In the famous judgment R vs. Electricity

Commissioners, Ex Parte London Electricity Joint Committee Company

(1920) Ltd. (1924) lKB 171 at 206 stated that a writ of prohibition is

available where a public authority exceeds its jurisdiction. Giving effect to the

order of the Magistrate is not an illegal act in excess of authority.

Accordingly this writ application is liable to the dismissed.
