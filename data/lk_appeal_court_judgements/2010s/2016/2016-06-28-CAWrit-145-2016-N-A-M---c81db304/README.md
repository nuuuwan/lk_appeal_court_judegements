Heard counsel in support of this application and the learned Senior

DSG representing the Respondents.

Petitioner has come before this Court by way of this application

seeking writ of certiorari prohibition and mandamus against the

Respondents with regard to an importation of a vehicle said to have

imported under the tax payers concession. His submissions before this

court was mainly based on the provisions of the Finance Amendment Act

No. 13 of 2007 which was further amended by Act No. 13 of 2007. He

submitted that under the provisions of the said act he is entitled to import a

vehicle on tax concession stipUlated in the said act and the Gazettes which

are issued time to time at a concessionary rate as explaining in the Gazettes.

His position was that when he imported the vehicle by X-8 the Secretary to

the Treasury had made orders withdrawing certain benefits given under the

said Finance Act and the said decision of the Secretary to the Treasury

suspending the tax concession is ultra-virus.

However, when going through the papers submitted before this Court

by the Petitioner, we observed that instead of the said tax payers benefit the

petitioner when clearing the vehicle had decided to clear the vehicle he has

so imported based under procedure category B-16 and the Gazette 1949/29

dated 12.01.2016 category 'C'.

The said category reads thus;

'A motor vehicle imported solely for private use in respect of which

with the letter of credit was opened on or before 20.11.2015 and registered

the vehicle on or before 31.03.2016 in the name of the person who uses it

for his or her private purpose and shall not be transferred for a period of five

years from the date of registration without prior approval from the General

Treasury.'

From the material placed before us it was clear that the letter of credit

for the vehicle so imported was opened prior to 20.09.2015 exactly on

16.09.2015. The raid conducted by the customs, he referred to in the

petition said to have taken place a date after 31.03.2016 in the early part of

April. At the time the said raid was conducted the vehicle was not registered

in any name but it was found in a car sale. The car sale owner too had given

a statement to the Custom official with regard to the said vehicle when

handing over the key to the vehicle to the Custom officials. From the above

2

facts it is clear that the petitioner was acting in violation of paragraph 'C' to

the Gazette dated 12.01.2016. However, we observe that the Petitioner has

not divulged these issues before this Court when he presented his case

before us. He was totally depending on the tax payers permit to which he is

entitled, but he has made use of a different category to import the vehicle. In

paragraph 9 of his petition he refers that the Custom had not permitted the

petitioner to clear the said imported car by utilizing the certificate he has

referred to. But we observe that the Petitioner when he submits the cusdec

through electronically he on his own declared that he is not coming under

the category of tax payer certificate but he was coming under category B-16.

When considering all these issues we see no merit in this application.

Therefore, we are not inclined to issue notices in this case. Notices are

refused. No cost is ordered.

Registrar is directed to issue a certified copy of today's proceedings to

both parties on payment of charges to the Petitioner and free of charges to

the Hon: Attorney General.
