JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The 4th - 15th Respondents named in this application are Film Directors. 1st

Petitioner claims to be a registered society called Seemasahitha Lankeeya

cinema Shilpeenge Sandhanaya, 2nd - 6th Petitioners are its President,

Secretary and members. The ih - 15th Petitioners are the President,

Secretary, Treasurer and other members of the Film Directors Guild of Sri

Lanka. The Petitioners in this application seek inter alia from this court ;

i. a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision (s) contained in the letter

dated 18-05-2013 issued by the 14th Respondent Acting Minister

(marked P 6)

ii. a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting anyone or more of the

.. Respondents from acting onl enforcing, t~e letter dated 18-05-2013

issued by the 14th Respondents Acting Minister (marked P 6) ;

iii. a Writ of Mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents

to strictly follow the decisions of the 2nd Respondent chairman (as

borne out by P 2) and the rules issued by the NFC (marked P 3)

9

read with the approval! endorsement of the 12th Respondent

Minister dated 12-02-2013 (marked P 4).

The 1ih Respondent (then Minister of Mass Media and Information) by the

document marked P 4 has directed the 2nd Respondent that the proposed

program of the National Film Corporation regarding the distribution of local

films to be implemented from 2013-01-01 would be that the 1st exhibition

of every film should be limited to 35 copies. Thereafter the Acting Minister

of Mass Media and Information has directed the 2nd respondent who was

the Chairman of the National Film Corporation by the letter dated 2013-05-

18 produced marked P 6 that where the National Film Corporation is

satisfied that the producing activities of a film had begun before the

effective date i.e. 2013-01-01, the rule restricting the number of copies at

the first exhibition of such film to 35 copies should not be made applicable.

It is this document that the Petitioners seek to quash in these proceedings.

The first paragraph of the letter marked P 6 states that he refers to the

rules made by the Minister of Mass Media and Information under sections

60 (1) and 60 (2) of the National Film Corporation Act which was effective

from 2013-01-01.

\ I

1 j

I 10 I I Section 60 of the National Film Corporation Act is as follows.

1) The Corporation may make rules in respect of all or any matters for

which rules are authorized or required by this Act to be made.

2) No rule made by the Corporation under this Act shall have effect until

it has been approved by the Minister.

It is the argument of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the letter

produced marked P 3 is a rule that had been formulated in terms of

section 60 (1) of the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act, and that

the said rule has been unlawfully altered by the issuance of the document

marked P 6, by the 1ih Respondent Acting Minister.

Perusal of the document marked P 3 does not reveal any indication that it

is a rule made under the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act. .. ~

However the 1ih Respondent Acting Minister by the letter has approved

the rule contained in P 3 with effect from 2013-01-01, in terms of powers

vested in him by Section 60 (1) and 60 (2) of the National Film Corporation

of Sri Lanka Act.

11

It is necessary at this stage to examine the procedure National Film

Corporation of Sri Lanka Act has provided for how the rules should be

made under that Act for, as to Section 5 of the National Film Corporation of

Sri Lanka Act states that the Corporation shall have such powers rights and

functions as may reasonably be necessary to carry out its objects and in

particular may ....

(j) Make rules in respect of the administration of the affairs of the

corporation.

This is the only power that has been given by the National Film Corporation

of Sri Lanka Act to the National Film corporation for formulating rules. This

limited power is clearly limited to make rules in respect of the

administration of the affairs of the corporation and nothing else.

It could be seen that the subject matter which is sought to be regulated by

the rule in P 3 by the 2nd Respondent who is the chairman of National film

Corporation af Sri Lanka is the subject of exhibition of films. It is dated

2013-02-12 marked P 4. Thus it is not related to the administration of the

affairs of the corporation. In view of this conclusion the document marked

P 3 cannot be considered as a rule formulated under section 5 (j) of the

III

tIf

~ f

~ Irt r! f

12

National film corporation of Sri Lanka Act. On the other hand, the 2nd

Respondent has not been empowered by the National Film Corporation of

Sri Lanka Act to make rules on such subject matter as has already been

shown above.

According to section 60 of the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act

the corporation is empowered by the act to make rules in respect of any

matter for which making rules by the corporation is authorized by the Act.

A closer look at the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act shows that

the corporation has not been authorized by the Act to make rules regarding

the exhibition of films which is the subject matter set out in the document

marked P 3.

It could also be seen from the provisions of the Act that it is the Minister

who has been authorized by section 61 of the National Film Corporation of

Sri Lanka Act, to make regulations on this subject matter. Relevant extract

of section 61 reads thus,

"

1) The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of carrying out or

giving effect to the principles and provisions of this Act.

iII, II

1 , I

13

I

2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub

section (1) the Minister may make regulations in respect of all or any

of the following matters ..... "

The subjects that the Minister may make regulations have been itemized in

section 61 (2) from (a) to (I).

It could be seen that the subjects pertaining to

the control supervision, inspection, maintenance and operation of

cinemas and institutions engaged in the film industry,

the exhibition of films,

the allocation of screen time for the exhibition of local and foreign

films,

the regulation of the use and distribution of raw films and

all matters conducive or incidental to the attainment of any of the

objects of the corporation or to the exercise of its powers,

are amongst them.

Section 61 (3) of the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act has made it

mandatory that the regulations made by the minister under this Act should

be published in the Gazette and shall come in to operation on the date of

II! I IIIIIi iiif

fi i,tI

t

14

such publication or on such later date as may be specified in the

regulation.

Further Section 61 (3) of National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka Act has

made it mandatory that the regulations made by the Minister under this Act

shall as soon as convenient be brought before the Parliament for approval.

That section has further stated that any regulation which is not so

approved by the Parliament shall be deemed to be rescinded as from the

date of its disapproval.

There is no material before us to show that any of the steps under Section

61 (3) and 61 (4) have been followed. The Act has made it mandatory to

follow these steps when making regulations by the Minister. The Minister

has not followed any of the above steps with regard to the documents

which the Petitioners have sought to categorize as rules.

.. The argument advanced on behalf of the Petitioners is founded on the fact

that it is the Corporation which has the authority of making rules under the

Act on the subject of regulating and screening of films and not the

Minister. This argument for the above reasons must necessarily collapse.

I t t

I ! I ,!I[

~ IiIIi t,t!

15

Once that argument collapses there is nothing left out in this case for the

Petitioners to proceed with.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis to

grant the writs prayed for by the Petitioners. Therefore we decide to

dismiss this application. However we make no order with regard to costs

Application is dismissed without costs.
