P.R. Walgama, J

The issue in this appeal is whether the Complainant-

Petitioner- Appellant IS entitled to recover the money

due on Three Trust Receipts issued to the Company

2

VIZ. 'Perfect Fit International Private Limited', by

instituting proceedings in the Magistrate Court.

The People's Bank of off shore Branch advanced a

financial facility to the afore said Company, on three

Trust Receipts mentioned herein under;

That on Trust Receipt No. 3/111 dated 19.02.2004 for

a sum US $ 94,500/ and US$ 177,000/ and 3/222

dated 24.03. 2004.

It is alleged by the Appellant that although the afore

said amount IS due from the afore said Company, it

had failed and neglected to pay the said amount.

In order to recover the said money due to the

Appellant Bank, it instituted action m terms of

Section 136(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and

for committing an offence under Section 3(2), and

offence punishable in terms of Section 4( 1) (iv) of the

Trust Receipts Ordinance No. 12 of 1947 as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1990.

Pursuant tfJ the institution of the proceedings thereon

the Learned Magistrate issued notice on the Directors

of the above Company, and on behalf of the

Respondents a preliminary objection was raised as to

the maintainability of the action In the Magistrate

Court.

The thrust of the argument of the Counsel for the

Respondents IS that only a breach or failure to

3

comply with the undertakings set out In Section 3(2 )

of the Trust Receipt Ordinance, which IS punishable

under Section 4(1) (iv) an action could be instituted

under the above Act.

Hence the circumstances attended there to the

Learned Magistrate was of the view that there is no

breach of the undertaking gIven In tenns of Section

3(2) of the Trust Receipt Ordinance.

For convenIence and brevity the Section stated above

is reproduced here under;

Section 3(2)

(2) In order to comply with the prOVlSl0ns of this

subsection, a document which IS executed by any

person In the circumstances mentioned In subsection

(1) must contain the following undertakings on the

part of that person m respect of the goods to

which the document relates;

l. an undertaking to hold those goods In trust for

the agency m favour of which it IS executed, to

mark the goods or the packages or cases containing

them In a specified manner, and to keep the goods

In specified premIses until the exportation thereof;

2. an undertaking, upon the exportation from Sri

Lanka of those goo~s to deliver to the agency the

bills of lading and their shipping documents relating

to such goods;

4

3. an undertaking not to sell those goods to any

other person in Sri lanka except with the consent of

the agency, and In the event of any such sale with

such consent to deliver the proceeds of sale from

time to time s received to the agency;

undertaking, In the event of those goods not 4. an

agency

5. an undertaking to permit the agency without pnor

notice from time to time to enter and inspect the

premIses In which those goods are kept and to

take stock of such of those b bgoods as may be ill

the premises; AND

6. an undertaking b to Insure those goods until the

exportation thereof, against all insurable risks to their

full insurable value on a reinstatement basis In the

name of the agency and In the case of loss to pay

the insurance moneys to the agency In the same

manner as the proceeds of the sale

Section 3 (3)

3. Nothing In subsection (2) shall be deemed to

prevent the inclusion ill the document of any

undertakings, conditions or stipulations In addition In

the undertakings specified in that subsection.

In the event of a violation of the above conditions

the Section 4 operates as the punitive _section which

states thus;

The person by whom the trust receipt was executed

shall, if he commits a breach or fails to comply

with any undertaking referred to In subsection (2) b

or subjection (3)of Section (2) of section 3, as

case may be , being an undertaking contained In

trust receipt be guilty of an offence and shall be

conviction after summery trial before a Magistrate

on

The fundamental bone of contention of the Appellant

Bank IS that the Section 4 (1) (iv) of the Trust

Receipt Ordinance also deals with the Criminal liability

in order to~ recover the loan facility advanced by the

credit agency on the purported trust receipt.

Therefore it IS contended by the Appellant that

Section 4(1) (iv) does not operate as a punitive

sanction only In respect of a breach contemplates In

Section 3(2).

Besides it IS alleged by the Appellant Bank that the

complaint made to the Magistrate Court was not

6

I /1 1/ II ji {' ;{ Ij // if if ../ .:/ I

only the non

Bank on the

payment of the money due to the

Trust Receipt, but has made of a

breach of several other undertakings, which should be

dealt under Section 4

(I) (iv) of the Trust Receipt Ordinance.

Nevertheless the Appellant Bank has admitted that it

has categorically stated as to the conditions that

breach has occurred.

It IS also contended by the Appellant that the 1st

and the 2nd Accused have not denied the liability

and therefore it it urged that the Court should

exercised its powers to recover this money due on

the Trust Receipts as the same was advanced by

the State Bank which in fact is public funds.

Thus in the above setting the Appellant Bank asserts

that when the facts were cogent that the Accused

being the Directors of the said Company had

advanced the money stated above on Trust Receipts,

but not repaid the same to the Bank, the Learned

Magistrate ~should have probe In to the transaction

proper without dismissing the application of the

Complainant- Petitioner- Appellant.

Being aggrieved

application by

Bank went in

by the said dismissal of the

the Learned Magistrate, the Appellant

Revision to the Provincial High Court

of Colombo to have the said impugned order set

aside.

The Learned High Court Judge after a due analysis

of the facts placed before her had arrived at the

conclusion that although the Appellant had the right

of appeal but without exercising the said right had

invoked the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court,

without establishing exceptional circumstances which

will warrant this Court to do so.

The Learned High Court Judge, after adverting to the

factual and legal matrix had dismissed the Revision

application of the Appellant.

Being dissatisfied with

Learned High Court

Appellant appeal to

the afore said order of the

Judge dated 10.07.2008, the

this Court to have the said

order vacate or set aside.

The ground norm of the argument of the Petitioner-

Appellant Bank was dealt exhaustively and I do not

wish to rehearse.

The Complainant- Petitioner- Appellant fundamentally

assailed the said impugned orders of the Learned

High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate on the

basis that their failure to evaluate the charge sheet

VlZ,

That an allegation of failure to pay as undertaken ln

clause 1 and 10 of the Trust Receipt,

AND

8

/

./

Breach and / or failure to comply a single, several or

all the undertakings referred to in the Trust Receipt .

A cursory glance at the said charge it is abundan tly

clear that the Accused -Respondents had been charged

not only In terms of Section 3(2) read with Section

4(1)(4) of Trust Receipt ordinance No. 12 of 1947,

amended by Act No. 13 of 1990.

It IS the contention of the Petitioner- Appellant that

apart from the undertaking given ill the Trust

Receipt the parties can also include any additional

undertakings and included ill the document. Therefore

it is asserted by the Petitioner- Appellant that Section

4( 1) which IS the punitive section does not only

cover the breaches stated In Section 3(2) of the said

Ordinance, but also In a situation where the person

by whom the trust receipt was executed had failed

to pay the money that was advanced and the

interest thereto.

Further it is the position of the Appellant bank that

~ they did not have the opportunity to catalogued the

the undertaking that was breached, but same could

be revealed during the course of the trial.

The stark point for consideration IS that non of the

Accused- Respondents had denied the liability, but had

only taken up the said issue to be decide initially.

l

The argument advanced

Respondent is that the non

by the

payment

3rd Accused-

of money does

not amount to a criminal act 1n terms of Section

3(2) of the Trust Receipts Ordinance. Therefore it 1S

the categorical position of the 3rd Respondent that 1n

the above situation does not amount to a criminal

act and therefore the private plaint and the charge

sheet filed by the Complainant -Petitioner- Appellant 1S

bad in law.

It 1S salient to note that the said loan on the

purported trust receipts were raised by the above

said Company. Therefore the Company should have

been made a party to

The Counsel for the 3rd Accused -Respondent adverted

Court to the fact, that the order made by the

Learned Magistrate 1S a final order discharging and

acquitting all the Accused and as such the proper

course of action against such order should be an

appeal. Therefore it 1S contended by the 3rd Accused-

Respondent, that when the Appellant had the right to

appeal to this court, and should have not invoked

the reVlslOnary jurisdiction of the High Court.

In addition it 1S submitted by the counsel for the

3 rd Respondent that, if the Appellant has chosen to

invoke the rev1s10nary jurisdiction to set aside the

said impugned orders he should aver exceptional

10

circumstances which warrants the exerCIse of the said

power.

It IS contended by the 4th accused -2nd Respondent

that he was not a Director in the Company in issue

as he has resigned from the Company in 2003, and

the charges relate to a peFi()d between 19th February

2004 and 24 of March 2004.

It IS also salient to note that no interpretation to

the above sections were given by our Superior Court.

Hence In the above setting this court IS persuaded

with the interpretation adduced to the afore

mentioned sections by the Counsel for the accused-

respondents.

For the above compelling reasons we dismiss the

appeal without costs.

Accordingly the appeal IS dismissed.

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J

I agree.
