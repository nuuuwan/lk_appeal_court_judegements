Petitioner of this application is a student of Prince of Wales College Moratuwa.

He seeks in his petition inter alia

3

1. a writ of Certiorari to quash a determination made by the 2nd and/or 5th Respondents

jointly and/or severally, contained in the communication dated 2016-07-20 which has

been marked and produced as P 5;

11. a writ of Mandamus to compel 1st - 3rd Respondents to conduct the under 19 cricket

tournament for 2016/2017 in accordance with the previously publicized regulation

contained in circular dated 9/3/2016 marked and produced as P 4;

It was the contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the Petitioner did not even

apply for admission for the Advanced Level examination to be held in 2016 as he had a

legitimate expectation of playing cricket for the school team in 2016/17 tournament in view of

the decision contained in P-4.

It was also the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the authorities must be

consistent in their decisions and it would be unlawful for them to set out one criterion in one

document giving expectations to the interested people and then suddenly change the rules in a

subsequent document. It was the position of the learned counsel that the Petitioner was left

stranded in between the change of these rules.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner urged this court to look at this problem in a broader

perspective as public interest litigation as numbers of young school boys have been affected by

this determination. The Petitioner has stated so in paragraph 3 of his petition.

4

Learned Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that, the Petitioner by postponing his G.C.E.

Advance Level Examination was getting ready for the tournament 2016/17 and by the impugned

decision contained in the document P-5 the Petitioner's education as well as the sports carrier has

been affected badly.

It was brought to the notice of court by the learned counsel for 1st - 3rd Respondents that the

closing date for submitting applications for the advanced level examination for 2016 was prior to

9th March 2016. This submission was not controverted by the learned counsel for the Petitioner.

Therefore the reason as to why the Petitioner postponed his examination, prior to the decision to

extend the age limit for tournament 2016/17 was communicated to the schools has to be an

extraneous one.

The letter marked P 4 is dated 2016-03-09. That letter only lasted less than 4 months. i.e. until

2016-07-20 which is the date of letter marked P 5. As such the reason as to why the Petitioner

did not apply to sit for Advanced Level examination in 2016 could not have been the

determination contained in the document marked P 4. In view of this finding this Court is

compelled to entertain serious doubts about the Petitioner's desire and intentions to engage in this

litigation as a public interest litigation as that was how the Petitioner states the public has been

affected in this case.

Even though the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner made an attempt to show that there was an

element of Public Interest in the present application by referring to certain documents he had

produced before the court, this court in not inclined to accept the above contention for the reason

that, the impugned decision affects a very small segment of students but at the same time there

were others benefited by the said decision.

In this regard we are mindful of the decision by the Indian Supreme Court in Janata Dal V, H.S.

Chowdhary (1992)4 see 305 the term Public Interest Litigation was interpreted as, "a legal

III! f

5

action initiated in court of law for the enforcement of Public Interest or General Interest in which

the public or class of the community has pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal

rights or liabilities are affected.

Since what the Petitioner seeks from this court is to compel the Respondents to maintain the

determination described in the document marked P 4, it is necessary, first to consider whether

that determination is a determination that has validly been made by the relevant authority

namely, Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association. The relevant portion of that letter is as

follows ..... " ..... we take this opportunity to remind all the principals of schools that the age

limited of the under 19 schools cricket tournament has been changed. This decision has been

taken at the last fixtures meeting held on July 2015 at Ananda College where all the Masters in

Charge and some coaches were present .... "

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the 1st - 3Td Respondents that the purpose of the

fixtures meeting is to fix dates for the school cricket matches and organize the calendar for such

cricket matches for the coming year. It was the contention of the learned counsel for the 1st - 3rd

Respondents that the so called determination mentioned in the document marked P 4 is not a

valid determination made by the relevant authority.

The constitution of Sri Lanka School Cricket Association is marked and produced as P 1. Clause

3 therein sets out the objectives of this association which requires that this association has to

work as an affiliated association to Sri Lanka Cricket.

According to clause 24.2 and clause 30.2 it must be the executive committee of the association

which should take decisions on behalf of the association. The composition of the Executive

Committee is set out in clause 11.

Petitioner was however unable to show to the satisfaction of this court that the decision he relies

upon is a validly taken decision by the relevant authority. In these circumstances we are

\I1,,

compelled to hold that the decision set out in the document marked P 4 is not a decision which

this court could uphold in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction.

In view of this, this court also cannot quash a subsequent communication contained in the

document marked P 5 as all what the letter P 5 has done was an annulment of a previous invalid

decision.

Even a communication which does not have lawful authority may gIve to the receiver an

expectation. However such an invalid communication cannot create an expectation that is

legitimate since the very communication is not by itself legitimate. Therefore this court cannot

agree that the document marked P 4 has created a legitimate expectation which the Petitioner can

agitate in a court of law exercising writ jurisdiction.

It is further revealed before this court that under ICC Rules and the Sri Lanka Cricket rules made

based on the ICC Rules, the school cricket tournaments are played as under 19 tournaments, and

by the decision conveyed in letter dated 9th March 2016, the age limit of the school cricket had

been changed "as under 20" which was not acceptable to the ICC Rules and the Sri Lanka

Cricket Rules.

The letter marked P 5 refers to the following 2 paragraphs" ...... we write to inform you that the

schools 1st xi cricket tournament shall be played as under 19 as have been played in the previous

years. The secretary of the Ministry of Education has sent us a circular NO. ED/9/15/2/2/2

(cricket) dated 2016-07-13 to play the tournament under the age group of under 19 as conducted

in the previous year's ... "

It was revealed during the submissions before us that the decision to change the age limit in

March was taken at a fixtures meeting held in July 2015 which was attended by Masters in

Charge and Some Coaches and was not a decision taken by the executive committee of the Sri

Lanka Schools Cricket Association as empowered by its constitution, but the said decision was

\

reversed on a directive received from the Ministry of Education through a circular No.

ED/9/15/2/2/2 (Cricket) dated 13.07.2016.

Indeed the above paragraph cited from P 5 shows that there is in existence a Ministry of

Education circular to that effect. The Petitioners, while being silent on this circular is not asking

for any kind of invalidation of this circular in this application. The question thus arises as to

whether which determination or rule to be followed by the schools in case the determination

contained in P 5 is invalidated.

In this regard this court cannot ignore the fact that, Sri Lanka School Cricket Association is only

an Association involved in facilitating the playing of cricket at Schools but, the Education

Ministry being the Ministry in charge of the Education, extracurricular activates and all the other

functions of children's education of this country has to act with responsibility when controlling

the activities in schools. Therefore this court cannot ignore the circular referred to in the letter

dated 20th July 2016 when considering the relief sought by the Petitioner, which are discretionary

in nature.

For the reasons set out above we see no grounds to interfere with the decision conveyed by the

Sri Lanka School Cricket Association in documents produced marked P-5. We therefore refuse

notices.

Application is accordingly dismissed without cost.
