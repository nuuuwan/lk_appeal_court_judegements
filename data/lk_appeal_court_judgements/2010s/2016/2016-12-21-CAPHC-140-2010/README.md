On 30.06.2005 the 2nd party Petitioner Respondent (the Respondent) who is a

son of the deceased's first marriage dispossessed the Appellant. Thereafter the

Appellant filed an information in the Magistrate Court of Chilaw under section

66 (l)(b) of the Primary Court Procedure Act. The Respondent's contention is

that he being a son of the Alfred, managed the land in dispute and it amounts to

possession. He further submits that he looked after the sickly father and did not

admit the marriage between the Appellant and his father.

The land in dispute is a land alienated to the said Alfred on grant under

the Land Development Ordinance. The Respondent states that he was

nominated as the successor under the grant.

After filing the documents, affidavits and written submissions the learned

Magistrate determined that the Appellant was in possession and was

dispossessed within two months prior to the filing of the information and

ordered to restore the Appellant in possession.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent moved in revision in

the Provincial High Court of Chilaw. The learned High Court Judge came to the

finding that the Appellant was the wife of the deceased and they were living in

matrimony in the disputed land, but the learned judge decided that as per the

nomination of the deceased Alfred the Respondent becomes the successor of the

land the Appellant as the wife of the deceased is not entitle to succeed and

further decided that there is no forcible dispossession, the Appellant vacated the

premises on her own and set aside the order of the learned Magistrate. This

appeal is from the said order.

The Respondent when he moved the matter in revision in High Court

Chilaw has failed to tender the relevant documents with the application. The

order of the Magistrate Court is the most relevant document that has to be

submitted with the application but was not tendered. In the application he

reserved the right to tender the certified copies of the written submissions but

3

not reserved the right to tender the order knowingly that the copy of the order

was not obtained from the Magistrate Court. He has pleaded that the copy of the

order was not received till the application is filed but has failed to reserve the

right to tender when obtained. Without getting involved in obtaining relevant

documents, the Court should have dismissed the application for violating the

rules of Court of Appeal Appellate Procedure Rules 1990, because the failure to

tender the material documents is fatal.

The revision is a discretionary remedy available only on the exceptional

grounds. It is settled law that unless exceptional circumstances are pleaded and

established, Court will not act in revision. Gamini Amarathunga J. after

considering several authorities, held in the case of Dharmaratne and another v

Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others [2003] 3 Sri L R 24 at page 29 that;

The requirement of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction is not a requirement statutorily laid down

anywhere. As Gunawardana J, himself has referred to, Abrahams CJ. in

Ameen v Rashid (supra) has explained the rationale for insisting on the

existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction. According to Abrahams CJ. revision of an appealable order

is an exceptional proceeding and a person seeking this method of

rectification must show why this extra-ordinary method is sought rather

than the ordinary method of appeal. As Hutchinson CJ. has stated in

Perera v Silva (supra) it is not possible to contend that the power ought

to be exercised or that the legislature could have intended that it should

be exercised so as to give the right of appeal practically in every case.

Thus the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which

the Court selects the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary method

of rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will become a gateway for every

4

litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision application or

to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given right

of appeal.

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root

in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should not be lightly

disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not indicate that it ever

intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice'.

In the revision application to the High Court the Respondent (the

Petitioner in that case) has failed to plead any exceptional circumstance. In the

paragraph 9 of the petition dated 18.09.2006, the Respondent pleaded to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court on the grounds pleaded

in sub paragraphs i to xvii where none of them could be considered as

exceptional grounds.

The learned Magistrate as well as the learned High Court Judge has

accepted that the Appellant was the wife of the deceased Alfred and they were

living in matrimony in the disputed land. The land was in possession of the

deceased until his demise. The Respondent was helping him to manage the

estate. The learned Magistrate has clearly analyzed the evidence such as

keeping the car at his father's premises, the statement that the Respondent

where he says that he is staying in the night in the disputed land and the

affidavits of the neighbors and come to the conclusion that the land was

possessed by deceased and the Appellant.

After the death of Alfred, the Appellant possessed the land. On

30.066.2005 the appellant had to leave the land in dispute and go to her own

land. She had to leave the land because she was threatened to leave by the

Respondent. She has made three complaints to the police on this threat. It

5

cannot be said that she left the premises on her free will but she was forced to

leave. It amounts to a forcible dispossession.

The learned High Court Judge has considered that the deceased Alfred

has made a nomination on succession, but it is not a matter that can be

considered in a case under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself and decided that

the Appellant had left the premises on her free will and she is not getting any

matrimonial right because of the nomination made by the deceased.

I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 04.11.2010

and affirm the order of the learned Magistrate dated 12.09.2006.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

P.R.Walgama J.

I agree.
