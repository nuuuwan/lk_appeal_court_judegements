Pursuant to an application filed in the Primary Court of Nuwara

Eliya, by the Petitioner - Respondent - Appellants (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellants) in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act,

the learned Primary Court Judge held an inquiry into the dispute between

Respondent -Petitioner -Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondents) made an order confirming the possession of the Appellants, in

respect of the land and the premises in question.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, Respondents sought to move in

Revision against the said Order by Revision Application No. 39/2001, filed

before the High Court ofKandy.

The learned High Court Judge, disagreeing with the Order made by

the learned Primary Court Judge, set aside the said Order on 07.01.2003.

6

The Appellants have now filed this appeal seeking to set aside the said

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 07.01.2003.

When this appeal was taken up for argument on 21.11.2012, the

learned Counsel for the Appellant had brought to the notice of this Court,

that there is no valid judgment made in the High Court, since the 1 st

Respondent had died pending the revision application in the High Court, and

as no substitution being effected before the delivery of the judgment by the

learned High Court Judge.

It was agreed by both parties to file written submissions on the

question of the validity of Judgment. It is relevant to note that written

submissions has been filed only on behalf of the Appellants.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant is, when this

Appeal was mentioned before this Court on 26.02.2013 it was brought to the

notice of this Court by the Counsel appearing for the Respondents that, the

1 st Respondent had died. The Counsel further contended when perusing the

death certificate of the 1 st Respondent - Ramasami Ramakrishnan, it was

revealed that the said Ramasami Ramakrishnan had died on 07.10.2002,

while the revision application was pending in the High Court Kandy and no

substitution had been effected in place of the deceased 1 st Respondent.

In the circumstances, it was the stance of the learned Counsel for the

Appellant, since the 1 st Respondent has died pending the Revision

Application in the High Court, and as no substitution had been effected

before the delivery of the judgment by the learned High Court Judge, the

said Judgment has no force in law and the said Judgment is null and void.

7

It is to be noted that the Revision Application had been taken up for

argument on 25.11.2002 (vide Page 34 of the brief) and the learned High

Court Judge has delivered the Judgement on 07.01.2003. As such, it is

crystal clear by this time the 1 st Respondent was dead and it had not been

brought to the notice of the Court.

In the circumstances, the issue now that arises for consideration is,

since the 1 st Respondent had died pending the case in the High Court,

whether the said Judgment is a nullity and or no force in law.

It was observed by Shirani Bandaranayake C.J. in Gamaralalage

Karunawathie vs. Godayalage Piyasena and Others - SC Minutes dated

05.12.2011 "When a party to a case had died during the pendency of that

case, it would not be possible for the Court to proceed with that matter

without bringing in the legal representatives of the deceased in his place. No

sooner a death occurs of a party before Court, his Counsel loses his position

in assisting Court, as along with the said death and without any substitution

he has no way in obtaining instructions. At that stage, the question arises, as

to how and what are the steps that has to be taken in order to cure the

defect".

In the present appeal, as clearly stated earlier, prior to the judgment of

the High Court dated 07.01.2003, the 1st Respondent had died on

07.10.2002. No steps had been taken for substitution of parties.

Accordingly, it is evident that the judgment delivered by the learned High

Court Judge is ineffective and therefore it would be rejected as a nullity.

For the said reason all proceedings after 07.10.2002 and the

Judgment of the High Court dated 07.01.2003 is set aside.

8

Accordingly, this case is sent back to the High Court of Kandy for the

Respondents (Petitioners in the High Court) to take steps according to law,

for substitution and direct the learned High Court Judge of Kandy to proceed

with the case after effecting substitution in place of the 1 st Respondent -

Ramasami Ramakirshnan.
