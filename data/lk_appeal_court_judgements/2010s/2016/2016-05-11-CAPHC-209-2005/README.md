Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Appellant of this case filed an application in the High Court of

Anuradhapura for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the notice

marked as P 11 to the Petition, sent to the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent.

The said notice had been sent by him under the Urban Development

Authority Act No.41 of 1978 as amended by Act No.4 of 1982 and Act No.

44 of 1984.

After considering the submissions made by both parties the learned

High Court Judge dismissed the Appellant's application. Aggrieved by the

said order the Appellant has appealed to this Court against the decision of

the learned High Court Judge praying for annulling of the said order.

The case was scheduled for argument on 11.06.2015. Only the

Counsel for the 1 st and 2nd Respondents were present and the Appellant was

absent and unrepresented on that day, although the Appellant had been

represented by a Counsel previously. In the circumstances submissions were

made on behalf of the 1 st and 2nd Respondents only.

The Appellant had made the application to the High Court of

Anuradhapura, for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the notice marked as P 11 to

the Petition. She averred that the 2nd Respondent, acting in excess or abuse

of his powers and motivated by political and other extraneous reasons, was

taking steps to demolish her building.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents filing their objections had stated in their

affidavit, that to remove the unauthorised buildings within the town limit of

Anuradhapura, they have taken steps lawfully and legally in their official

capacity.

Lord Justice Atkin in R vs. The Electricity Commissioner (1924) 1

KB 171 at 205, has given the circumstances in which a Writ of Certiorari

will lie. It was held in that case "Where anybody or persons having legal

authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having

duty to act judicially, acts in excess of their legal authority, they are subject

to the control".

In the case of Biso Menike Vs. C.R. De Alwis (S.C. 59/61),

Sharvananda 1. (as he was then), stated, "a Writ of Certiorari is issued at the

discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to be a writ of right or one issued

as a matter of course".

The exercise of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well

accepted principles. The fundamental principal is that the rights of a person

would have been affected by any decision or determination for the Court to

consider.

It is relevant to note, that the facts emerged in this case do not show,

that the 1 st and 2nd Respondents have acted in excess of their legal authority

affecting the rights of the Appellant. The Appellant has not submitted to

Court or shown any illegality or procedural irregularity in sending the said

notice marked as P 11.

Hence, I am of the view, that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have acted

correctly and legally within their power and the Appellant is therefore not

entitled for the reliefs prayed for in the Petition.

On perusal of the entirety of the Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge, it is apparent that learned High Court Judge has taken into

consideration the submissions made by both parties and has come to the

5

conclusion that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have the legal right to send the

said notice marked as P 11 to the Petitioner and the availability of an

alternative remedy precludes the Appellant from seeking relief by way of a

prerogative writ.

Hence, I do not see any error in which the learned High Court Judge

has considered the facts and the way in which he has applied the law in this

instance.

Accordingly, I see no basis to interfere with the Order made by the

learned High Court Judge and affirm the Order dated 29.06.2005.

For the reasons stated above the appeal is dismissed with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P.R.Walgama, J.

I agree

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
