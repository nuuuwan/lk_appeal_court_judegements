L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the District Court of Kandy.

The Plaintiff Respondent (the Respondent) instituted action in the

District Court of Kandy alleging that he is the lessee of the Milk Booth

under the Government Agent. His contention is that he constructed the

said Milk Booth with the permission of the G.A. and after obtaining the

necessary permit from the Municipal Council Kandy. After some time he

handed over the Milk Booth to one Rubasinghe as his licensee to run the

business. After the death of Rubasinghe the Defendant Appellant (the

Appellant) is occupying the Milk Booth without his permission. After

issuing a quit notice, this action was instituted to declare his right to

posses as a lessee and to eject the Appellant. The Appellant filed answer

and claimed that she is in possession of the Milk Booth on the strength of

an order made by the Magistrate Court under section 66 of the Primary

Court Procedure Act. After trial, the learned District Judge decided the

case in the Respondent's favour. Being aggrieved by the said decision,

the Appellant presented this appeal.

At the argument, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted

that this is a possessory action because the Respondent is claiming

possession under a lease. I do not agree with this argument. The claim of

the Respondent is that he is the lessee of the premises. He is claiming his

right to possess under the lease. It is an admitted fact that the land where

the Milk Booth is constructed is a state land. But the building was

constructed by the Respondent. A witness from the Kandy Municipal

Council gave evidence and produced the approved plan where the

Respondent was permitted to construct the building. Rubasinghe (the

Appellant was the mistress of Rubasinghe) has admitted in the Primary

Court (Magistrate Court) that the Respondent is the owner of the Milk

3

Booth. He has given an affidavit in a 66 application filed in the Kandy

Magistrate Court. The Appellant is claiming through Rubasinghe.

Therefore it established that the Milk Booth is owned by the Respondent.

In an early case Goonewardana V. Rajapakse et al. 1 NLR 217

Bonser, C. J. considering a notarialy executed lease held that;

In my opinion we ought to regard a notarial lease as a pro tanto

alienation, and we ought to give the lessee, under such a lease,

during his term, the legal remedies of an owner and possessor (see

D. C, Colombo, 55,552, Vanderstraaten, p, 283, and Perera v.

Sobana, 6, S. C. C. 61, where the distinction between a modern

lease and a Roman colonus or inquilinus is recognized).

In the case of Luwis Singho And Others V. Ponnamperuma [1996]

2 Sri L R 320 the law was further developed by Wigneswaran J. after

considering several authorities and held at page 325 that;

But in an actionfor declaration of title and ejectment the proof that

a Plaintiff had enjoyed an earlier peaceful possession of the land

and that subsequently he was ousted by the Defendant would give

rise to a rebuttable presumption of title in favour of the Plaintiff

and thus could be classified as an action where dominium need not

be proved strictly. It would appear therefore that law permits a

person who has possessed peacefully but cannot establish clear

title or ownership to be restored to possession and be quieted in

possession. This development of the law appears to have arisen due

to the need to protect de facto possession. It is different from the

right of an owner recovering his possession through a vindicatory

action. Our courts have always emphasized that the plaintiff who

institutes a vindicatory action must prove title. (Vide Wanigaratne

v. Juwanis Appuhamy. (7))

U. De Z. Gunawardana, J. held in the case of Ruberu and another

V. Wijesooriya [1998] 1 Sri L R 58 at page 60 that;

But whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is

foreign to a suit in ejectment against either. The licensee (the

defendant-respondent) obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it

upon the terms that he will not dispute the title of him, i. e. the

plaintiff-appellant without whose permission, he (the defendant-

respondent) would not have got it. The effect of the operation of

section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires

to challenge the title under which he is in occupation he must, first,

quit the land. The fact that the licensee or the lessee obtained

possession from the plaintiff-appellant is perforce an admission of

the fact that the title resides in the plaintiff. No question of title can

possibly arise on the pleadings in this case, because, as the

defendant-respondent has stated in his answer that he is a lessee

under the plaintiff-appellant, he is estopped from denying the title

of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an inflexible rule of law that no

lessee or licensee will ever be permitted either to question the title

of the person who gave him the lease or the licence or the

permission to occupy or possess the land or to set up want of title

in that person, i. e. of the person who gave the licence or the lease.

That being so, it is superfluous, in this action, framed as it is on the

basis that the defendant-respondent is a licensee, to seek a

declaration of title.

In the present case Rubasinghe under whom the Appellant is

claiming has admitted the Respondent's title and therefore she is estoped

from denying the title of the Respondent.

5

At the argument the Counsel for the Appellant claimed tenancy.

His contention was that Rubasinghe was a tenant under the Respondent.

While denying the title of the Respondent, she cannot claim tenancy

under the Respondent. On the other hand the Appellant cannot succeed to

tenancy because she is not the wife of Rubasinghe. The learned District

Judge clearly analyzed that no right will flow to the Appellant by living

in adultery with Rubasinghe. The learned Counsel argues that she was a

business partner, but there is no evidence to that effect. The evidence is

that she was living in adultery with Rubasinghe and on that relationship

she is coming to the Milk Booth.

The Appellant in her answer has not claimed any tenancy. Her

claim is based on the order of the Primary Court Judge (the Magistrate) in

the 66 application. Under the explanation 2 of section 150 of the Civil

Procedure Code, a party cannot present a case substantially deferent from

the pleading. The section reads;

The party having the right to begin shall state his case, giving the

substance of the facts which he proposes to establish by his

evidence.

Explanation 1 ...... .

Explanation 2

The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the party's

pleading, i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. And no party

can be allowed to make at the trial a case materially different from

that which he has placed on record, and which his opponent is

prepared to meet. And the facts proposed to be established must in

the whole amount to so much of the material part of his case as is

not admitted in his opponent's pleadings.

6

In the present case there was no claim of tenancy in the answer.

Therefore, the Appellant is precluded from bring in a totally new claim in

the appeal.

Thus it is seen that the position taken up in appeal for the first time

was not in accord with the case as presented by the defendant in

the District Court. It is well to bear in mind the provisions of

explanation 2 to section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code. It reads

thus:

"The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the party's

pleading, i. e. plaint or answer, as the case may be. And no party

can be allowed to make at the trial a case materially different from

that which he has placed on record, and which his opponent is

prepared to meet ...... ". A fortiori, a party cannot be permitted to

present in appeal a case different from the case presented before

the trial Court except in accordance with the principles laid down

by the House of Lords in The Tasmania (4) and followed by Dias,

J. in Setha v. Weerakoon (5). The question of licence or sub

tenancy involved matters of fact which were not put in issue at the

trial. This was certainly not a pure question of law which could

have been raised for the first time in appeal. I find myself unable to

agree with Mr. Samarasekera that these were matters which fell

within the issue raised on behalf of the plaintiff relating to the

unlawful occupation of the premises.

The Appellant's claim in the answer IS that she was gIven

possession by an order of the Primary Court (Magistrate Court) in an

application filed under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

-/ 7

The order of the Primary Court under this section is a temporary order

which has its validity only till a judgment of a competent court is

pronounced. The section 74 of the Primary Court Procedure Act provides

that the order of a Primary Court is no bar for a civil action. The section

reads;

74. (1) An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any

right or interest in any land or part of a land which any person

may be able to establish in a civil suit; and it shall be the duty of a

Judge of a Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry

under this Part to explain the effect of these sections to the persons

concerned in the dispute.

The Appellant cannot rest her claim of right to possess on an order

of a Primary Court pronounced under part VII of the Primary Court

Procedure Act.

Under these circumstances I do not see any reason to interfere with

the judgment of the learned District Judge.
