This appeal is preferred by the appellant to set aside the order of the

Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa holden in Rathnapura, dated

311112007 in case No.HCRlWRlI6/04 and to issue a writ prayed by the

appellant and for costs.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 06/09/2016 the

petitioner-appellants were absent and unrepresented. 1st to 3rd respondents

were present and also represented by the State Counsel. The learned State

Counsel made oral submissions and further he moved for time to file written

submissions. On 22/9/2016 counsel for the Respondents submitted that the

written submissions tendered at the Registry and the judgment was reserved

for 1011112016. On 1011112016 which was also referred for 09/12/2016.

The three petitioner-appellants sought certiorari in the High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province in Ratnapura to quash the decision of the

Divisional Secretary, Eheliyagoda (1 st Respondent)to draw electricity

wires over their property. The petitioner's position is that the said decision is

unlawful in that there is a shorter route on which the wires can be drawn and

as such there was no necessity to encroach upon the petitioner's property.

That the respondent was acting maliciously in collusion with the 4th

respondent whose ulterior motive he was seeking to further. The

respondents position that the learned High Court Judge dismissed the

petitioner's application because when the matter was taken up for the

argument the petitioners were not present in court nor were they represented

by the counsel.

The State Counsel makes brief submissions explaining that the writ

application before the High Court could not be maintained for want of

jurisdiction and it was contended by the respondent as follows:

"The terms of Article 154 (P) (4) (b) of the Constitution provides that

the Provincial High Court has writ jurisdiction only over such matters that

come within the Provincial Council list in the Ninth Schedule. Thus, for the

petitioners to succeed they must show that the subject matter of this

application is included in the saiA Provincial Council List." It was also

contended that in arriving at the decision to draw the electricity wires over

the petitioner's property regard to the alternative route proposed by the

petitioners. This has to be rejected as inquiry conducted in terms of

Electricity Act found that the route is more invasive of private property then

the one thorough the petitioner's property. The respondents also submits

that the Divisional Secretary's decision cannot be subjected to judicial

review. Section 15 (11) provides" the decision of the government agent

under the section in regard to any of the acts specified in the notice under

subsection (3) shall be final". The position has confirmed in the Surabiel

Singho and others Vs. Don Kularatne Rajapakse and others in

C.A.No.934/88.

As regard to submissions that the drawing of an electricity lines

creates a public servitude. I have to note that this is a novel submission. A

servitude is right pertaining to property which is applicable at the common

law. Electricity Lines are drawn in terms of statutory power that is vested

under the Electricity Act. They are two entirely different concepts.

Therefore I cannot agree with the submission that the consideration relevant

to the granting of a right to way of necessity should apply in relating to the

drawing of electricity lines.

In 2003, the 2nd and 3rd respondents proposed the drawing of a high-

tension electricity had from Wickremakanda to Epitawela and inquiry under

the provisions of Electricity Act , the 1 st respondent decided to approve the

aforesaid scheme. Consequently , the petitioners filed the present

application averring inter alia that the said electricity lines were to be drawn

over their land and praying that the decision of the 1 st respondent at X6 be

quashed.

The respondent having after filed their objection. And the High Court

Judge direct to file submissions in writing. Since no relief has been claimed

from the 2nd and 3rd respondents and they have been named only for the

purpose of notice, the 1 st respondent tenders his written submission.

The petitioner's position was that the 1 st respondent had decided the

proposed route of the electricity lines over their land, even though there

existed an alternative route over the Gamsabba Road. It was alleged that the

above 1st respondent's decision has been a result of the intervention and

coercion of the 4th respondent who was seeking to ensure that the road upon

the petitioner's land which was the subject of the proposed route would be

declared a public road in the future. The petitioners are of the position that

the proposed electricity route is of danger to their property and the decision

to construct same should be quashed. The 1 st respondent position was that

the petitioners have no right to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court in

the present matter in terms of the Constitution in terms of Article 154P (4)

(b) (ii) of the High Court of the Provinces has jurisdiction only with regard

to subject contained in the Provincial Council List the extension of

electrification within the provinces and the promotion and regulation of the

7

use of such electricity is in fact contained in the Concurrent list under items

32 thereof.

The 1 st respondent submits that the court has no jurisdiction to hear

the present application and therefore, the petitioner's case dismissed in

limine. And the unreported judgment in the Chilaw High Court Case

No. 122/94 decided on 20.07.1994 marked "IRl" .

Accordingly we find that the learned High Court Judge has arrived at

a correct decision. We see no reasons as to why we should interfere with the

order of the learned High Court Judge and dismiss the appeal without costs.
