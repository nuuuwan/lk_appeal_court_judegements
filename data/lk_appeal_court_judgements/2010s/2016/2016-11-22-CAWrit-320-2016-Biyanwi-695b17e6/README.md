Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J (PICA)

Heard learned Counsel for the petitioner and learned Deputy Solicitor General representing

respondent authority. The petitioner complaints before this Court and submits a decision

conveyed to him by document P7. According to P7 the 1st respondent authority has

terminated the services of the petitioner with effect from 29.09.2016 after giving one month

notice. As reveal before this Court petitioner who is appointed as Director (export services

and marketing) is still on probation in the 1st respondent authority. He first joined the 1st

respondent authority as a consultant for a period of six months and while he was in service he

has applied for an internal post of director export services and export marketing and he was

selected after an interview. However, it was revealed thereafter that the petitioner was not

having the basic qualification to be employed in the said post since he was not having a basic

Degree. This issue was raised by the Auditor General in his report and based on this the 1st

respondent authority has considered this issue. We observe that the termination of the

petitioner was purely contractual since he had a service contract with the employer 1st

respondent authority and during his probation period the employer has terminated his

..

service. Therefore it is our considered view that this decision is taken purely on the service

contract between the employer and employee. The petitioner's position before this Court is

that the respondent being a State agency there is a statutory flavor in to the decision taken by

the 1st respondent authority. However, this matter had been looked into in several decisions

by this Court and the learned Deputy Solicitor General submits before us a recent unreported

decision of 183/2010 where H/L Justice Chitrasiri has clearly discussed this issue and decided

that the contractual obligation between State agency and an employee does not come under

the writ jurisdiction. In this regard we are also mindful of the famous case of Gawarammana

vs. Tea Board where H/L Justice Sripavan had held that the powers derived from the contract

are matters of private law. The fact that one of the parties to the contract is a public authority

is not relevant since the decision sought to be quashed by way of certiorari is itself was not

made in the excise of any statutory power.

Having considered the above decision and the material I have already discussed we see no

merit in this application before us and therefore we are not inclined to issue notice.

Notice refused.

No cost is ordered.

P. Padman Surasena, J.

I agree.
