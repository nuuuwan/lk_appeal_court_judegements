The Petitioner has preferred this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 30/4/2008 and further relief as prayed in the petition and for issue

an order of writ of certiorari to quash the order of transfer as communicated by P8

and for writ of mandamus compelling the 1 st and 2nd Respondent to cancel the transfer

as stated in P8 with cost.

Notice were issued to both parties and the Appellant was absent and unrepresented.

While Respondent was present and was represented by counsel. Both Appellant and

Respondent has paid their brief fees. However when this case was mentioned on

27/5/2016 the Appellant was absent and unrepresented and argument concluded and

order has been reserved by Mrs. Walgama J, who ordered the Respondent to file

written submissions. When this matter came up before the present bench on

25/7 12016 the Appellant was absent and unrepresented. The Respondent agreed to

dispose this case by way of written submissions which he has failed to comply with.

The Petitioner's position was that he was appointed as a substitute teacher by letter

dated 1992/5/4 marked as PI by the Deputy Director Education, Kegalle. He was

appointed to Malawita 1 Kegalle and was thereafter transferred to Kegallel Panakawa

Vidyalaya and served at the latter school ti1l2006-10-16. While serving at Panakawa

VIdyalaya as an English teacher, without any reason, the Director of education

transferred the Petitioner to Palapoluwa Kanishta Vidyalaya. Thereafter he pointed

out the error of the transfer to the 1 st and 2nd Respondent the same was cancelled the

said transfer.

The 2nd Respondent had by letter dated 2006-01-30 sought to propose a 10%

allowance to special education teachers and that by letter dated 2006-02-07 marked

P7 the Principal Panakawa Vidyalaya had commended the Petitioner's satisfactory

service. Further the Petitioner was confirmed in service on 2002-01-08 by the

Director at education Kegalle by his letter marked P5. That he attended a seminar

designed for special education. That his students had received scores which revealed

a high standard of education and that his work was commended by the Principal at

Panakawa Vidyalaya. He stated that without reason and arbitrarily the 1 st and 2nd

Respondents by letter marked P8 and in non-compliance with the annual transfer

procedure as stated in circular dated 2006-10-16 marked P9 the Petitioner was

transferred to Algama Madya Maha Vidyalaya with immediate effect.

The Petitioner states that P8 is,

a. Contrary to the Principles of Natural Justice,

b. Unreasonable and arbitrary,

c. Contrary to the general procedures adopted in relation to transfers,

d. Contrary to law and

e. Contrary to the regulations as contained in chapter III of the establishment

Code.

He also states that by his letter dated 2006-10-22 that he had appealed against P8 to

the Provincial Education Director, but had not received a reply and that on numerous

occasions the Petitioner had requested the Principal Panakawa Vidyalaya and on one

occasion requested the 1 st and 2nd Respondents to invalidate the unlawful transfer.

The Petitioner also averred that the Petitioner had dispatched a reminder dated 2006-

12-10 to the pt Respondent referring to his appeal. Hence, the Petitioner seeks to

have P8 quashed by way of a writ of Certiorari.

The Respondent version was that a situation had arisen at Panakawa Vidyalaya where

various complaints of sexual misconduct had been reported. The 1 st and 2nd

Respondents having authority over the educational institution in question are duty

bound to act in the interests of the students. Also, the alleged acts of misconduct as

were in relation to year 7 female student. Therefore such complaints have to be

investigated as the same amounts to an offence under the Penal Code. It is for this

reason that the Petitioner was transferred to Palapoluwa Kanishta Vidyalaya.

The Respondents further add,

a . That P7 as tendered by the Petitioner is a forgery and that the Principal,

Panakawa Vidyalaya denies ever issuing the said certificate,

b. That the above position is manifest when P7 is compared with P4 ; the

signatures do not match,

c. That the Petitioner was transferred not in accordance with the annual transfer

procedures and instead in terms of section 3:05 of the circular marked P9,

d. That the reason behind the transfer was the in light of sexual misconduct of

the Petitioner with a year 7 student and also in view of the opposition of

the parents had towards the unbecoming conduct of the Petitioner.

Sec 769(2) of the Civil Procedure Code read as follows,

" 769 (1) ....

(2) If the Appellant does not appear either in person or by an attomey-

at-law to support his appeal, the court shall consider the appeal and

make such order thereon as it thinks fit."

Accordingly as the Appellant absent and unrepresented we Act under Sec 769(2) and

peruse the order dated 30/4/2008 with the relevant document VI to V9.

The Petitioner had stated that the transfer given to him has not been recommended

by the teacher transfer board and that notice of 2 weeks should have been given to

him and there was the teacher transfer board existing in the school. However the said

transfer had been given arbitrarily and unlawfully in violation of the regulations.

His Lordship had stated as follows,

" Even accepting that the 4th Respondent did have power to make the

impugned transfers, an essential pre requisite for the exercise of that power

was the recommendation of the teacher transfer board. His failure to obtain

those recommendations vitiated the transfer orders, which were, therefore in

violation of the petitioner's fundamental rights under Article 12(1)

Per Fernando J,

"While powers in respect of education have been devolved to provincial

councils, those powers must be exercised in conformity with national policy.

Once national policy has been duly formulated in respect of any subject, there

cannot be any conflicting provincial policy on that subject."

The transfer letters did not allege "exigencies of service" it is not open to the

respondents to allege one reason in the transfer letters and to rely upon another

when they come to court. Apart from anything else, that would be stultifying

the appeal procedure."

The Petitioner contended that the Zonal Education Director of Kegalle and the

Assistant Education Director ofKegalle(Planning) without any reason or inquiry has

by letter dated 16/10/2006 O:>z/O:>z(3)/qG)l5)/ol @/lI<32.o.) has unlawfully using the

administrative power transferred the Petitioner. They have violated 2/8/2002

Sabaragamuwa Province CMlDE/O 110 1109 and they have failed to comply with the

Ministry Circulars 2002/01 teachers and principal annual transfer's regulations and

hence given the Petitioner transfer to Algama Madya Maha Vidyalaya.

Accordingly Petitioner prays for relief prayed in the petition be granted to him.

The Respondents has placed the following evidence before the High Court.

Document marked R1 is a complaint made by the 9 teachers ofPanakawa Vidyalaya

who allege that the Petitioner is guilty of the following,

1. Making advances on a year 7 student which could have led to sexual abuse

of the said student,

11. Outsiders are in the habit of entering the school premises at night at the

instance of the Petitioner and that the said outsiders have caused damage to

school property,

111. Consumption of alcohol within school premises,

IV. For having used the school premises do carry out business transactions,

v. For abusing a contractor who was working on the construction of a school

building and

VI. F or physically abusing a student.

Document marked R2 is an excerpt from the Sunday Newspaper Silumina dated

19/10/2003. As highlighted, the petitioner out an advertisement to sell a motor cycle

and has given his contact details as Panakawa Vidyalaya. This itself shows the lack

of respect shown to an educational institution. The Petitioner is utilizing the school

property as a business place for his personal transactions. Such conduct is detrimental

to the reputation of the school.

Document marked R3 this is a document dated 05/10/2006 which a complaint is made

by a year 7 student alleging sexual harassment. It was contended that the conduct by

the Petitioner is unbecoming and cannot be tolerated in an educational institution

where parents leave there children with the faith that their children are in good and

capable hands.

Document marked P4 is a statement made by the Principal, Panakawa Vidyalaya on

12/02/2007. Whereby he states that the order marked P8, the Petitioner had not

vacated his quarters at the school and that inquiries were made by parents and past

pupils as why steps were not taken to have the Petitioner evicted from the premises.

It was submitted that the Petitioner's refusal to leave the quarters displays his

arrogance, contempt for authority, and sheer indiscipline.

Document marked P5 is a petition dated 19/01/2007 signed by 85 parents against the

conduct of the Petitioner. It was contended that the said error is typographical and

that the same be pleaded as part and parcel of the statement of objections.

It was also submitted that the said Rl, the parents of students at Panakawa Vidyalaya

have petitioned the Zonal Director of Education against the Petitioner alleging that

his conduct impedes the progress and development of the school and have stated the

following reasons for removal from the school.

The complaint states that,

a. The Petitioner has made various indecent proposals to his students,

b. The Petitioner threatens the parents,

c. That he is using the teachers quarters to carry out his business and,

d. That he is admitting unauthorized persons to the school premises in the

evenmgs.

When consider the above evidence placed before court we are of the view that the

Appellant has been reprimanded for misconduct and for complaint about the Petition

has been made by a child of 7 years for sexual harassment and the Appellant

misconduct has been placed before court, We find that the Appellant has failed to

reveal these facts that his conduct has been questionable. The Respondents on the

other hand have in authority over the educational institution in question are duty

bound to act in the interest of the students.

The Respondent further states that the Petitioner has not come before this court

uberrima fides in light of many unmeritorious acts committed by him. It has been

submitted that the Petitioner as a teacher is responsible for the many students who

come under his care. It is he who has the duty of instilling good values and inculcating

discipline and decorum. A female child has complained of sexual misconduct to her

teachers. It is the duty of the school to protect her from further harm and in the

meanwhile ascertain the truth of the allegation. Hence, the statement by the Petitioner

that the 1 st and 2nd Respondents had transferred him without reasons is an absolute

falsehood when in fact the Petitioner was informed that the transfer was as a result of

his misconduct.

In the light of the facts and circumstances of this case and regulation 3.05 of the

circular marked P9 the inquiry will take place after the transfer. Hence the transfer is

in order to facilitate the inquiry and was done in the best interest of all parties

concerned.

The Respondent submitted that the Petitioner has also tendered to document P7 which

is forgery is clear indication of the Petitioner's lack of uberrima fides. Hence we are

of the view that on this ground alone the Petitioner ought to be dismissed. The

Petitioner in his application have sought a writ of mandamus to compel the 1 st and

2nd Respondents cancel the order marked P8. This remedy is an alternative to the

relief sought ( a) and (b) of the prayer. The Respondent contended that there is no

statutory duty on the part of the Respondents to cancel P8 and therefore, prayer (c)

of the petition cannot be granted.

Having considered above submissions made by both parties the Learned High Court

Judge has stated that the Petitioner Appellant has been transferred in order to

faciliting the inquiry and was done in the best interest of all parties concerned. The

Petitioner is able to face an inquiry and prove his inn ounce. The Petitioner has failed

to disclose all material facts in this case and has shown lack of uberrima fides on his

part. Any party who misleads court, misrepresents facts to court or utters a falsehood

in court will not be entitled to obtain redress from court.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa V. Siriwardena, Principal, Vishaka Vidyalaya 1986 1

SLR 275 and others, that a Petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an

extraordinary remedy must in fairness to this court, bare every material fact so that

the discretion of this court is not wrongly invoked or exercised. Accordingly the

Petitioner must be dismissed for lack of ubberima fides.

Accordingly we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has arrived had a

correct decision we see no reason as to why we should interfere with the said order

of the Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle.

Hence we dismiss this appeal with cost ofRs. 10,0001-.
