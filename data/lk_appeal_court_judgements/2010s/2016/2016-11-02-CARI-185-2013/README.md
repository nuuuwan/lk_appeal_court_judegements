CASE-NO-CAl 185/2013- JUDGMENT- 28.10.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The Defendant -Petitioner -Petitioner launched the

instant application seeking to set aside the order of

the Learned District Judge dated 27.05.2013, and to

set aside or vary the terms of settlement entered on

15.03.2012, accordingly.

According to the settlement as stated above both

parties had admitted that the land more fully

described 1n the 2nd schedule to the plaint belongs to

the Defendant. Further it was admitted by both parties

that the subject land 1S depicted 1n plan bearing No.

819 made by L.W.Perera license Surveyor dated

31.03.2001.

3

It IS to be noted that In said impugned

Learned Magistrate has made order to the

effect, in that it IS stated after resurveYIng

order the

following

the land

described In the 2nd schedule which IS In the

possesslOn, of the Defendant, the plain tiff will be

entitled to possess the same. The above contents of

the said terms do not sound logical.

After the Court has entered the terms of settlement

on 15.03.2012, the Defendant - Petitioner has lodged the

petition In the District Court of Kalutara, seeking to

amend the settlement or to vacate the settlement

accordingly and had stated the following;

That the Plaintiff and the Defendant are brothers who

became entitled to the land In suit. It IS stated, that

the plaintiff by virtue of deed bearing No. 381 dated

10.04.2004 has gifted a portion of said land described

in the 2nd schedule to the plaint to the Defendant-

petitioner. It is the position of the Plaintiff that except

for the 9 perches given to the Defendant, that he is

entitled to the balance portion of the land described

In the schedule to the plaint and more fully depicted

as lot 2 In the final plan 320.

Further it IS alleged by the plaintiff that the

Defendant encroached

the plaintiff which is

It is common ground

the 2nd schedule to

a part of the land belonging to

In extent in 2 or 3 perches.

that the property described In

the plaint IS owned by the

4

Defendant and for the purpose of the above settlement

both parties have admitted the plan No. 819 dated

31.03.2001 made by L.W.Perera license surveyor.

Further it was agreed between the parties that the

Defendant shall vacate any encroachment of the

property described In the 2nd schedule belonging to

the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff agreed to vacate any

encroachmen t of a portion of the property described In

the 2nd schedule belonging to the Defendant.

As per terms of settlement entered thereto the decree

was en tered accordingly.

Thereafter the Defendant - Petitioner tendered the Petition

seeking to amend or set aside the said settlement,

which application was opposed by the Plaintiff -

Respondent.

The Learned District Judge after the inquiry in to the

above application of the Defendant- Petitioner made

order dismissing the application had made the following

observation.

That the Defendant was aware of the contents of the

said plan No. 2011/28, and the above settlement was

entered inter parties, and the Defendant was aware of

the contents of the above plan and now he IS

estopped from rejecting the same.

5

Being aggrieved by the said order the Defendant-

Petitioner tendered the application for Restitutio In

Integrum to this Court.

The Plaintiff -Respondent had opposed the said

application in limine and had raised the Issue as to

the maintainability of the present application, for the

petitioner has failed to mention the specific relief VIZ.

Restitution in integrum.

To buttress the above position the Plaintiff- Respondent's

counsel had cited many decided cases. In the case of

INAYA AND ANOTHER .VS. FATHIMA 2006 (2) SLR 124

The above case was an application for Leave to

Appeal, the Court of Appeal inter alia held that the

absence of a specific prayer for Leave to appeal from

a specific order made by the original court, was fatal

to the maintainability of the application. The Court of

Appeal inter alia held that as well as in the affidavit

it IS stated that the instant application IS for leave

to appeal from an order of the District Court

Kalutara dated 3rd September 2004 or from any other

order made by the District Court of Kalutara.'

Therefore it IS stated by the Plaintiff - Respondent that

the Defendant - Petitioner's caption of the application

seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way

of Restitutio In Integrum In respect of the order of

the District Court of Kalutara dated 27.05.013 does

not appear as required by law.

6

The above legal position was also observed In the

case of WICKRAMASINGHE .VS. KULASINGHE-2006-(2)-

SLR- 51 and has upheld the preliminary objection inter

alia that the failure to specifically pray in the prayer

to the petition 'to admit the appeal notwithstanding

laps of time' IS fatal to the maintainability of the

application' .

Therefore it IS ostensible in the light of the above

determination it is vital to mention in the prayer, the

relief sought by the petitioner.

It IS also contended by the Plaintiff- Respondent that

Restitutio in Integram IS granted only if no other

remedy is available to the party aggrieved.

It is salient to note that the Defendant -Petitioner has

stated In the petition that he will be filing a petition

of appeal against the said impugned order.

It was opined by Their Lordships In the case of

SINNA VELOO .VS. MESSERS LIPTION LTD- 66 NLR. 214,

'that once terms of settlement as agreed upon are

presented to Court and notified thereto and recorded

by Court, a party cannot resile from the settlement

even though the decree has not been entered'

(emphasis added).

Further it has also been considered In the case of

SRI LANKA INSURANCE CORPORATION .VS. SHAMUGAM

7

AND OTHERS-1995, (I) SLR 63-HIS LORDSHIP

Ranarajah. J has observed thus;

"Restitution IS granted only if no other remedy IS

available to the party aggrieved. The petitioner has made

two applications in reVlSlOn and also filed a final

appeal against the orders complained of."

Further it has been also observed thus;

That the relief by way of Restitutio In Integrum of

original courts may be sought only;

a. Where judgments have been obtained by fraud

by the production of false evidence, non-

disclosure of material facts, or by force; or

b. Where fresh evidence has cropped up SInce

judgments which were unknown earlier to the

parties relying on it or where no diligence could

have helped to disclose earlier ;or

c. Where judgments have been pronounced by

mistake and decree entered thereon provided of

course it IS an error which connotes a

reasonable and excusable error.

Therefore it is explicitly stated the grounds on which

that a party could resort to the above relief.

Hence it IS crystal clear no fraud

of facts occurred for the parties

settlement concerned.
