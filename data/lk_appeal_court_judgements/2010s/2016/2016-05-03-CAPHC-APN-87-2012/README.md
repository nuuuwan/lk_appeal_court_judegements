The Petitioner has preferred this application seeking to revise and set

aside the sentence imposed against the Accused- Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) by the Order dated 14.12.2011 of the learned

Trial Judge of Kandy and substitute a lawful and an adequate sentence

according to law.

This matter comes up on a reVISIOn application filed by the

Honourable Attorney General (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) from

the sentence imposed on the Respondent by the Provincial High Court

Kandy.

The Accused - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent)

was indicted before the High Court of Kandy for committing rape on Nagesh

3

Thayageshwari, daughter of the Respondent, on or about the 02 of August

2005, being a person under sixteen years of age and thereby committing an

offence punishable under Section 364 (3) of the Penal Code.

When this case was called on 14.12.2011, Respondent's Counsel

informed Court that, the Respondent is willing to plead guilty to the

indictment. Then the indictment was read over to the Respondent and he

pleaded guilty to the charge of rape set out in the indictment. Upon the

Respondent pleading guilty, learned State Counsel and the Defence Counsel

made submissions as to the facts and circumstances of the case. The learned

State Counsel invited the Court to impose appropriate sentence, considering

the serious nature of the offence. The Defence Counsel also made

submissions in mitigation of sentence.

Thereupon, the learned Trial Judge sentenced the Respondent to a

term of two years (02 years) imprisonment and a fine of Rupees Two

thousand five hundred (Rs.25001-) with a default sentence of one year

(01 year) rigorous imprisonment. The said term of two years rIgorous

imprisonment suspended for a period of seven years (07 years). Further

ordered a sum of Rupees One hundred and fifty thousand (Rs.150,0001-) as

compensation, to the victim being the victim of the offence with a default

sentence of two years (02 years) rigorous imprisonment.

The Hon. Attorney General has filed this Revision Application and

has moved this Court to set aside the said sentence imposed on the

Respondent on the basis that it is totally disproportionate having regard to

the serious nature of the offence to which the Respondent has pleaded guilty.

4

According to the proceedings before the High Court, the

circumstances in which the offence was committed are as follows:

The Respondent is the father of Nagesh Thayageshwari (Prosecutrix)

who was thirteen years (13 years) of age at the relevant time. The

Respondent who was drunk on that day threatened to kill his wife after an

argument and chased after her with an axe. The wife fearing for her life left

the house with her third child. In the night the Respondent went near the

prosecutrix and wanted her to remove her clothes. When she refused, the

Respondent forcibly removed her clothes and then forcibly raped her.

The rape had taken place on 02.08.2005 in the house when the mother

was away. The day after the incident, the Respondent threatened to kill the

prosecutrix if she told the incident to anybody. On 07.08.2005 prosecutrix

went to Matale with her brother. She met her mother and told her that she

was raped by the Respondent. On the same day mother went to the Police

station with the prosecutrix and made a complaint.

When this case was taken up for argument on 21.01.2016 the

Respondent was absent and unrepresented although the notice had been

issued on him.

Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that this case presents a

serious incident where a 13 year old girl was forcibly raped by her father.

The Respondent was drunk on that day, threatened to kill his wife, chased

after her with an axe, the wife left the home, in the night the Respondent

went near the prosecutrix and asked her to remove her clothes, when she

refused Respondent removed her clothes forcibly and raped her. I agree

5

with the learned Senior State Counsel that these are aggravating

circumstances.

It is the stance of the learned Senior State Counsel, that the sentence is

manifestly inadequate having regard to the nature of the offence and the way

it had been committed. He contended that when a minimum mandatory

sentence is prescribed, suspending such a term of imprisonment is illegal

and contrary to Section 303 (2) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 if 1979, as amended by Act No.47 of 1999 and the learned Trial

Judge has misdirected himself with regard to the ratio decidendi in S.C.

Reference No. 03/2008. I agree with the submissions of the learned Senior

State Counsel that the facts and the circumstances in this case are entirely

different from the above case where the Supreme Court decided not to

impose minimum mandatory sentence.

In S.C. Reference No. 03/2008, the accused was a boy of around 15

years of age, and the victim on whom the statutory rape had been committed,

was also under 16 years at the time of the incident. In the case of No.

179/2012, Thilakawardana J. commented that the decision of the S.C.

Reference No. 03/2008 would only apply in cases where the Accused is

under the age of 16. "Indeed, quite correctly the rationale of that case was

that where children under 16 years of age were being indicted and 1 or were

convicted of the act of rape, the Court being the upper guardian of the child,

would also have to consider the best interests of the Accused who also, in

the eyes of the Court, would be considered a child as he too was under 16

years of age and for reasons to be recorded by the Judge in such cases only

the sentence could be mitigated and reduced below the mandatory period.

6

This Court ratifies the principle that in such cases, where the accused

is under 16 years of age, the sentencing would depend on the facts and

circumstances of each case and if the age of the Accused was 16 years or

under, their age would be a material and relevant fact. This however, in the

eyes of this Court, would only apply in cases where the Accused is under the

age of 16 years" .....

It is relevant to note, the facts in this case can be clearly distinguished

from the facts in S.C. Reference No. 03/2008, the Respondent is the

prosecutrix's father who was 36 years of age at the time the offence was

committed. Hence, the ratio decidendi of S.C. Ref No. 03/2008 is, if the

victim and the accused are under 16 years of age, the sentencing would

depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, and if the age of the

accused was 16 years or under, their age would be a material fact and

relevant fact to mitigate and reduce the sentence below the mandatory

period.

The facts, as submitted by the learned State Counsel disclosed the

rape of a child of 13 years by her father, which will have enormous mental,

physical, emotional, behavioral and development repercussions on this child.

As a result, the Court must consider the interests on the offender, the victim

and the public, in addition to the consequences of the sentencing. As such I

am of the view, the learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself with regard

to the ratio decidendi in S.C. Ref. No. 03/2008.

It is the stance of the learned State Counsel that the learned Trial

Judge has failed to consider the facts and circumstances of the case when

7

imposing the sentence. The learned State Counsel has drawn the attention of

this Court to several relevant authorities in this regard.

As to the matter of assessing sentence in the case of Attorney General

vs. B.N.G. De Silva (Supra) Basnayake A.C.l. observed as follows:

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a

judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of

the public and the offender. A judge should in determining the proper

sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence, as it appears from the

nature of the act itself, and should have regard to the punishment provided in

the Penal Code or other Statute under which the offender is charged. The

reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an important consideration is

subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the

welfare of the State (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good

character, antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must prevail".

In the case of Attorney General vs. Mendis 1995 (1) SLR 138, it was

held, to decide what sentence is to be imposed on the Accused, the judge has

to consider the point of view of the Accused on the one hand and the

interests of the society on the other. In deciding what sentence is to be

imposed the judge must necessarily consider the nature of the offence

committed, the gravity of the offence, the manner in which it has been

committed, the machinations and manipulations resorted to by the Accused

to commit the offence, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity in which it has been committee and the involvement of others in

committing the crime.

8

The learned High Court Judge has given the following reasons in his

Order for not imposing a mandatory sentence and imposing a suspended

sentence.

(i) The incident had taken place six years ago.

(ii) Now the age of the prosecutrix is 19 years and she has got

married to one Nandaraja.

(iii) If the prosecutrix gives evidence against the accused, her

marriage will come to an end and she will come to an end.

It is significant to note although the Respondent's conduct was

disgraceful, when the Defence Counsel making submissions in mitigation of

sentence, he has not mentioned a single word that the Respondent repents of

the offence which he had committed.

It is clearly shown that the learned Trial Judge has looked at only one

side of the picture; the side of the Respondent. He has failed to consider the

gravity of the offence and the manner and the circumstances in which it was

committed. The learned Trial Judge has not considered the prosecutrix's

age. He has not considered that the prosecutrix is the daughter of the

accused. The Respondent's violent behaviour and the gravity of the offence

had not been duly considered by the learned Trial Judge before imposing a

non-custodial sentence.

It is relevant to note, that the Respondent was indicted under Section

364 (3) of the Penal Code. The sentence prescribed for the said offence is, a

sentence of rigorous imprisonment of not less than fifteen years (15 years)

and not exceeding 20 years (20 years) and a fine. However, the learned

High Court Judge acting under Section 303 (1) (e) (k) (i) of Criminal

9

Procedure Act No. IS of 1979 amended by Act No.17 of 1999 proceeded to

impose the following sentence:

A sentence of two years (02 years) imprisonment and a fine of Rupees

Two thousand five hundred (Rs.2S001-) with a default sentence of one year

(01 year) imprisonment and suspended the said term of two years (02 years)

imprisonment for a period of seven years (07 years). Further compensation

of Rupees One hundred and fifty thousand (Rs.1 SO,OOOI-) with a default

terms of two years (02 years).

In the instant case, the learned Trial Judge has imposed a suspended

sentence on the Respondent. If he wished to impose a suspended sentence

of imprisonment, he should have addressed his mind to all the issues listed

under Section 303 (1) (a) - (i) and also the reasons should have been stated

in writing. In this case the learned Trial Judge has not addressed his mind to

these issues. Also he has not stated the reasons to impose a suspended

sentence. In the circumstances, if the learned High Court Judge took a

lenient view of the matter, he should have stated the reasons on which such a

view was taken.

The circumstances relevant to the commission of the offence and the

fact that the Respondent is the father of the victim clearly illustrates that the

imposition of a suspended term of imprisonment is not justified.

In Karunarathne vs. The State 78 N.L.R. 413, it was held that, "the

Courts should not give the impression that when they commit these offences

they can get away with it by getting a suspended sentence and going scot

free".

10

When a person commits a cnme by violating criminal law he is

punished by imprisonment, a fine or any other mode of punishment which is

prescribed by any other law. The purpose of a criminal punishment may

vary. Protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who

might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The main objective of

criminal justice is to protect society from criminals by punishing them under

the existing penal system. The Court has to weigh all relevant factors in

order to determine the blameworthiness of the offender.

I am of the view that the Respondent had been the perpetrator of a

very serious crime which had been committed with much deliberation and

planning. Had the learned Trial Judge considered the relevant factors or

criteria referred to above in determining what the appropriate sentence

should have been, the sentence imposed on the Respondent may well have

been different.

Having regard to the serious nature and the manner In which the

offence has been committed by the Respondent, I am of the view that the

sentence imposed in this case is grossly inadequate. It is seen, several

aggravating circumstances are present in this case. I cannot escape from the

conclusion that the Respondent has been too leniently treated by the learned

Trial Judge without any justifiable reason. The offence is far too grave to be

dealt with a suspended imprisonment. Such lenient treatment of an offender

for such serious crime is bound to defeat the main object of punishment,

which is the prevention of crimes. There is no doubt that the crime

committed by the Respondent is a heinous crime which requires a deterrent

punishment.

11

On the whole I am of the view that public interest demand that a

custodial sentence be imposed in this case and this is a fit case to impose it,

having taken into consideration the nature, gravity of the offence and the

manner in which it has been committed. I set aside the sentence of two

years (02 years) rigorous imprisonment imposed on the Respondent by the

learned Trial Judge dated 14.12.2011 which has been suspended for a

period of seven years (07 years) and sentence the Respondent to a term of

fifteen years (15 years) Rigorous Imprisonment. The compensation and the

fine ordered by the learned Trial Judge is affirmed.

For the reasons stated above the application in revision is allowed, and

the sentence is varied.
