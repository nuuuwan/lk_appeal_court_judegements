CASE- NO. CA - (PHC) 82/2011- JUDGMENT- 27.04.2016

P.R.Walgama, J

The question in this appeal IS whether the Court

below was correct in its reasoning and conclusions. bv

making order for the Respondent-Petitioner -Appellant to

vacate the Government quartes.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent ( in short Respondent)

instituted action against the Respondent- Petitioner-

Appellant( in short the Appellant) in terms of Section 6

of the Government quarters (Recovery of possession) Act,

in the case bearing No.85764/05 in the Magistrate

Court of Colombo.

The Learned Magistrate by his order dated 12.02.2010

has issued the writ, but had given on sympathetic

grounds for the Appellant 3 months tc vacate the

premises. As the Appellant did not vacate the

premises the Learned Magistrate has ordered to

the Appellant accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Appellant came

the Court of

It was also 0 bserved by the Learned High Court

Judge, that although the Learned Magistrate would have

made order for the immediate vacation of the suit

premises, nevertheless on sympathetic ground has allowed

him to stay for three months.

It was the contention of the Petitioner - Respondents

that there are no prov1sIOns 1n terms of Government

quarters (Recovery of Possession Act) to stay the

execution of the writ issued by the Magistrate.

It 1S also to be noted that the Appellant had failed to

disclose the fact that the certain parties who was

served with quit notice has made an application for a

mandate 1n the nature of a writ of Certiorari to

quashed the order of the Petitioner - Respondent has

been refused by the Court of Appeal.

In the above setting the Learned High Court Judge

was of the view that the above factual matrix do not

warrant to reVIse the said impugned order of the

Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

High Court Judge the Appellant has appealed to this

Court to have the said order vacate or set aside.

III

As tersely stated facts In the Petition of Appeal are

as follows;

That the Learned Magistrate has not gIven the

opportunity to show cause and there by violated the

audi alteram partem rule. But it IS trite that show

cause procedure IS not followed In the recovery of

posseSSlOn act.

That as per Cabinet decision taken on 14.08.1991 it

was decided that the houses that were occupied by

the Government Servants at Jayawadenagama Housing

Scheme to be transferred to the occupIer on payment

decided by the Cabinet.

The Petitioner- Appellant has been In occupation In the

suit premIses over 20 years, and In 1990 has retired

from the Telecommunication Department.

It IS the position of the Petitioner - Appellant that when

he retired from the services the Secretary to the

l'vlinistry of Public Administration a..lld Home Aff9jp:,S had

permitted the Petitioner - Appellant and his family

members to occupy the said quarters even after his

retirement.

The Petitioner - Appellant stressed the fact that by the

Cabinet decision bearing No. 1991/116(52) dated 21 st

August 1991 has been decided to hand over the

Government Quarters to the government servants who

are occupying the quarters.

The afore said decision of the Cabinet

was

communicated by the Secretary to of

Housing and Construction to the National Housing

Development Authority by the letter marked as P4A.

And the rent to be paid 1n terms of the schedule

attached to the said letter. The said letter 1S marked

as PIO.

It 1S more fully averred 1n the petition that the

Petitioner -Appellant had been pay1ng rent to the

disputed prem1ses and also the water and the electricity

bills were paid with the expectation of purchasing the

said quarters.

Further it 1S to be noted that by notice to quit

dated 3l 8t August 2005 the 2nd Respondent directed

the Petitioner to vacate the quarters within 2 months

thereon 1n terms of Government Quarters Recovery of

Possession Act No. 7 of 1969.

By the letter dated 30th September 2005 marked as

P24 the Assistant Secretary informed the Petitioner that

he would take steps to recover the Quarters.

It is alleged by the Petitioner -Appellant that the notice

to quit dated 31 st August 2005 is null and void and

non est 1n law for the grounds stated

paragraph 32 of the petition.

1n the

The ground norm of the argument of the Respondent is

basically that the said quarters are required for the

succeeding government servant employed with the 18t

Respondent.

Along with the Petitioner- Appellant quit notices were

served on occupants and an action was filed in the

7

l\Jr magIstrate Courts to eject them. The par:ics

appealed against the order of the Magistrate and the

said appeals had been dismissed by the High Court

and the Appellate Court.

Further it IS contended by the Respondents

said Cabinet decision

was taken much pnor to the serving of the quit

notice, the Petitioner - Appellant could have not had

any legitimate expectation of purchasing the

quarters.

As a comprehensive response to the position taken by

the Petitioner- Appellant regarding the

the Section 12 (1) of the Oaths

Ordinance, the Respondent states thus.

non compliance of

and Affirmation

The above section is reproduced for easy reference here

under thus;

"provided that the commlSSlOner for oaths shall not

exerCIse the powers glVen by this section In any

8

proceedings or matter in which he is the attorney - at-

law to any of the parties, or in which he is otherwise

interested" .

It IS the contention that said P.E.M.D.K.Palipana has

signed the as the Competent Authority, and also has

certified as the Commissioner of oaths.

But it IS the position of the Petitioner - Respondent

that the said Attorney at the time the oath was

administered to the affidavit In 2005, was not the

attorney-at-law on record of the 1 st Respondent.

Therefore it is said that there IS no violation of the

said provlslOn In the year 2005 when the oath was

administered as the said Ms. Palipana was not the

attorney for any party. Hence this Court ::.s of the

VIew that there IS no merits In the objection raised

by the Defendant - Petitioner - Appellant and same should

stand rejected.

Therefore In the above setting it IS contended by the

Petitioner - Respondent that the said Ms. Palipana was

not the Attorney for the 1st Respondent and therefore

the said affidavit is valid in law.

In essence it IS abundantly clear that the Learned

Magistrate has gIven an opportunity for the Appellant

three months time to vacate, although there IS no

provlslOns for such, and further this court could accepl

the alleged affidavit, and compelled to hold that the

ejectment order is valid in law.

9

Thus I affirm the of the ORDER of the Learned High

Court Judge and the Order of the Learned Magistrate

and dismissed the Appeal accordingly.

Appeal is dismissed subject to a cost of Rs. 5000/.
