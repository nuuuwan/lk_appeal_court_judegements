This is an appeal against a judgment of the learned District Judge of

Negombo. The Plaintiff Respondent (Respondent) instituted this action

claiming compensation for a road traffic accident. The Respondent's case is

that while he was riding a motor bicycle on Negombo - Merigama road

towards Negombo, a cow suddenly crossed the road making him to apply

brake to avoid colliding with it. The bus, negligently driven by the 1 st

Defendant, came behind on the same direction and hit him causing injuries.

As a consequence to this accident, the Respondent was hospitalized for 11

days. His spleen ruptured due to the accident and had to undergo an operation

and it was removed. He was claiming Rs. 250,0001- as compensation. The 2nd

Defendant Appellant (Appellant) filed answer denying the allegation of

negligence and took up the defence of contributory negligence of the

Respondent and inevitable accident. The learned District Judge after trial

awarded the full amount claimed as compensation. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment, appealed against it.

The bus driver, the 1 st Defendant, was charged in the Magistrate Court

for negligent driving and failure to avoid an accident under Motor Traffic

Act. He pleaded guilty to the second count, i.e. failure to avoid an accident

and the first count, i.e. negligent driving, was withdrawn by the police. The

details of the charge that he pleaded guilty are thus;

a) The 1st defendant is the driver of the CTB bus No. 30 Sri

7587

b) He failed to avoid an accident and hit against the motor

bicycle No. 93 Sri 215

c) He failed to;

1) Drive the vehicle in a controllable speed suitable to

the place and the situation,

2) Drive the vehicle carefully and

~ 3) Drive the vehicle with a proper lookout on the other

users of the road.

The 1 st Defendant pleaded guilty to this charge and on his own plea, he

was convicted and fined Rs. 500/-

The amendment brought to the Evidence Ordinance in 1998 by Act 33

of 1998, made a conviction in a criminal Court a relevant fact in a civil Court.

Section 41 A (2) reads thus;

41A. (2) Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1), where in

any civil proceedings, the question whether any. person, whether such

person is a party to such civil proceedings or not, has been convicted

of any offence by any court or court martial in Sri Lanka, or has

committed the acts constituting an offence, is a fact in issue, a

judgment or order of such court or court martial recording a

conviction of such person for such offence, being a judgment or order

against which no appeal has been preferred within the appealable

period, or which has been finally affirmed in appeal, shall be relevant

for the purposes of proving that such person committed such offence or

committed the acts constituting such offence.

This section provided that a conviction is admissible evidence in a

civil suit where the fact that he (the person whom so convicted) has

committed the acts constituting the offence is a fact in issue. Before this

amendment the law was that a conviction is admissible only if it is on an

admission of guilt. It has been so held in the case of [2006] 2 Sri L R 272

Mahipala and Others vs. Martin Singho. Edissuriya J. after considering

several authorities; expressed the law relating to admissibility of a conviction

in criminal Court, in a civil action.

The r t defendant was charged in respect of the said accident under the

Motor Traffic Act (Cap 203) as amended by Act, No. 21 of 1981 and

Act, No. 40 of 1984, for failure to report an accident, for negligent

driving in breach of section 151 (3) and for failure to avoid an

accident in breach of section 149(1) of the Motor Traffic Act. The main

charge was driving the vehicle bearing No. 6306 negligently,

recklessly and dangerously, without care or regard to the other road

users and knocking down the cyclist, Martin Singho, causing grievous

injuries to him. The accused (1 sl defendant) tendered an unqualified

plea of guilt to all charges, whereupon the accused was ordered to pay

Rs. 600 as State costs. [Journal Entry dated 23.08.1995 of the case

record of M C. Anuradhapura case No. 6648 (page 187 of the Judge's

briej)j

The r t defendant's plea amounted to an admission that he drove the

Army truck bearing No. 6306 on that occasion negligently, recklessly

and dangerously, without care or regard to the other road users, at an

excessive speed and lost control of the said vehicle and knocked down

the cyclist, Martin Singho, causing grievous injuries to him. The 1st

defendant's unqualified plea of guilt is most relevant and admissible as

evidence of negligence on the part of the rt defendant.

The learned State Counsel contended that a plea of guilt in a criminal

case has no effect on the consideration in a civil matter. The learned

State Counsel heavily relied on the unreported Court of Appeal

judgment in CA No. 146/91(F)CA minutes of 29.10.1996. In this case

Justice Edussuriya, held that a plea of guilt in a criminal case does not

establish negligence in a civil action. The Court of Appeal of the

United Kingdom in Hollington Vs. Hewthon Ltd. (1) held that evidence

of a conviction was inadmissible in subsequent proceedings. However

the full Bench decision in Western Australia in MicKelberg Vs.

Director of the Perth Adint(2), refused to follow that decision, and held,

evidence of a prior conviction is admissible.

The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has also held that a plea of guilt in a

criminal court is admissible in civil proceedings. In the Supreme Court

case of Sinnaih Nadarajah Vs. Ceylon Transport Board(3) it was held

that where the driver of a vehicle is sued along with his employer for

the recovery of damages resulting from an accident in which the

plaintiff suffered injuries by being knocked down, a plea of guilt

tendered by the driver, when charged in the Magistrate's Court in

respect of the same accident, is relevant as an admission made by him

and ought to be taken into consideration by the trial judge in the civil

suit. Wimalaratne, J who delivered the judgment in this case referred

i

to the aforesaid case of Hollington Vs. Hewthon and Co. Limited

(supra) and said (at 52),

"In Hollington Vs. Hewthorn & Co. Ltd., (supra) a conviction of one of

the defendants for careless driving was held to be inadmissible as

evidence of his negligence in proceedings for damages on that ground

against him and his employer. But had the defendant before the

Magistrate pleaded guilt or made some admission in giving evidence

that would have supported the plaintiff's case, this could have been

proved but not the result of the trial. per Goddard, L. J ............ The 2nd

defendant's plea of guilt in the lv/agistrate's Court was, therefore, most

relevant and to have been taken into consideration by the learned

Judge in assessing the plaintiffs case"

The law in regard to this is explained by Ratnalal & Dhirajalal in

"The Law of Evidence ",19th edition at page 185, with reference to

Indian cases, asfollows:

"It is a well-recognized principle of law that a conviction in a criminal

case is no evidence of the facts on which that conviction was based in a

civil case in which those facts are in issue or form the subject-matter of

the suit. But the authorities are clear that, when a conviction is based

on a plea of guilty, that plea is relevant and to prove in the judgment in

the criminal case is admissible in evidence in the subsequent civil suit

in which the facts giving rise to the charge are in issue or form the

subject matter of the suit." Meenakshisundaram Cheety Vs.

Kuttimali(4)

In assessing the plaintiffs case the learned Judge has considered the

plea of guilt of the 1 st defendant in the case filed against him under

the Motor Traffic Act for negligent driving in breach of section 151 (3)

of the Act, by committing one or more of the grounds of the negligent

acts described in the charge. The 1 st defendant's plea of guilt is most

relevant and the learned Judge has correctly taken that into

consideration. In criminal proceedings the prosecution must prove its

case beyond reasonable doubt. However in civil proceedings a balance

of probability is sufficient to decide the case in favour of the plaintiff

The plaintiff is not required to demonstrate his case. When the 1 st

defendant pleaded guilty to thl? aforesaid charges of reckless and

negligent driving under the Niotor Traffic Act, in the Magistrate's

Court, it has legal proof in the legal sense.

This position was changed by the Legislature by making the

conviction, irrespective of whether it is on an admission of guilt or otherwise,

admissible in a civil suit. In the instant case the driver of the bus, the first

Defendant, pleaded guilty in the Magistrate Court.

A conviction on charge of failure to avoid an accident under Motor

Traffic Act to become relevant in a civil action for compensation for

negligent driving; the conviction must be on the same items as complained

of, by the Plaintiff, which constitute the negligent driving. If the driver has

not admitted or was not found guilty for the acts of negligence complained of,

the conviction cannot be made use to prove his negligence.

De Mel and another V. Rev. Somaloka [2002] 2 Sri L R 23 at 27

It has to be emphasized that adrtzissions must specifically relate to the

items of negligent driving as set out in the plaint.

In the present case the Plaintiff in paragraph 11 of the plaint describes

the negligent acts of the driver of the bus, the 1 st Defendant. Out of item (i) to

(ix) in the said paragraph, item (i) and (vii) are the same as items specified in

the charge sheet. The first it'~m in the paragraph 11 of the plaint is that the 1st

Defendant was driving the vehicle in an excessive speed. The first act that he

failed to do according to the charge sheet is that he failed to drive the vehicle

in a controllable speed. When it is put to the positive form, it means that he

was driving the vehicle in an excessive speed. The eighth item in paragraph

11 of the plaint is that he drove the vehicle without paying attention to the

vehicles and pedestrians going along the road. The third item that he failed to

do to avoid the accident as per the charge sheet is also the same. Under these

circumstances, the driver of the bus wus convicted on his own admission at

least for two negligent acts complained iii the plaint. Therefore the conviction

in the criminal case becom.;;:; relevant and admissible in the civil action. It

was held by Edissuriya 1. in lvlahipala a;.d others v. Martin Singno (supra) at

page 276, "The 1st defendant'S unqualified plea of guilt is most relevant and

admissible CiS evidence of negligence on the part of the Ft defendant. " And at

page 277 "if has legal proof in the lega: sense".

Except the conviction in Magistrate Court, other evidence is also

available to establish the negligence of the 1 St Defendant. The Plaintiff

Respondent was riding his motor bicycle in front of the bus driven by the 15t

Defendant. The driver of the vehicle running behind has a duty of care to see

that he is keeping a safe distance from the vehicle going in the front and

maintain a speed that he will not collide with it. In the instant case the tyre

mark of the bus was 13 m~ters. It fflcans that after applying brakes, the

wheels of the bus has come to a halt but the bus kept moving for 13 meters.

No evidence to show that the road was wet or sandy. The only explanation

possible is that the bus was running in a high speed and it skidded for 13

meters before coming to a halt. This itself constitute negligence.

The Appellant raised the defence of contributory negligence of the

Respondent. The Appellant was mostly relying on the fact that the

Respondent did not possess a driving license issued by the Commissioner of

Motor Traffic. If a person possess a driving license, it establishes the fact that

I t

I

he is competent in driving that kind of vehicle, but not having a driving

license does not necessarily mean that he cannot drive that type of vehicle. It

may be an offence under the law to drive a vehicle on the road without a

driving license, but whether it was the cause for the accident is matter that

has to be proved separately. Not having a driving license alone does not

prove the negligence. In the present case the Respondent stated to Court in

evidence that he was riding motor bicyc~es from the age of 12. No evidence

to the contrary was led.

The learned DSG for the Appellant submitted that if the Respondent

was a competent rider, he would have balanced and controlled the bike

without toppling when he applied break to prevent hitting the cow. No

evidence to show that the Respondent was not competent enough to ride a

motor bike. It is the Appellant who had the last opportunity to avoid the

accident. He was coming behind the motor bicycle. He can see what is

happening in front of him. The cow coming across the road, the Respondent

breaking his motor bike and toppling happened in front of the Appellant. He

had the last opportunity to avoid the accident, but he could not, because he

was driving the bus too fast. It vvas the Appellant who had the last

opportunity but not the Respondent. The Respondent cannot be blamed for

contributory negligence.

Daniel V Cooray. 42 NLR 422

In cases where the defendant pleads contributory negligence the

inquiry resolves itself in an elucidation of the question as to which

party, by the exercise of ordinary care, had the last opportunity of

preventing the occurrence.

The learned DSG's s'..-lbmissiort Lhat the learned District Judge has

failed to consider the defence of contributory negligence in his judgment, is

not correct. The learned District Judge :::onsidered the said defence and has

come to the finding that there is no contributory negligence. I do not see any

reason to interfere with this finding.

The Appellant submits that the learned District Judge has failed to

assess the damages properly. It is the contention of the Appellant that the loss

of income and the physical injuries not proved by the Respondent. Before

going in to the details of this submission, the Respondent's claim must be

considered. In paragraph 14 of the plaint he says that he worked as a lorry

cleaner and earned Rs.30001- per month but in paragraph 16 and 17 of the

plaint he does not claim any pecuniary loss on the basis of "loss of income".

In paragraph 16 he claims Rs. 200,0001- for the physical pain and

inconveniences and in paragraph 17, Rs. 50,0001- as expenses incurred for the

special medical treatment, cost incurred on medical attendants, cost of special

meals, and travelling expenses. In these circumstances, it is not necessary to

consider whether the Respondent was employed prior to the accident and his

income and whether there is any disability to engage in an employment in

future. It is not a fact in issue in this case.

He is claiming Rs. 200,0001- for his pam and suffering. The

Respondent was injured due to this aCcldent was hospitalized for 11 days and

had to undergo an operation to remove his spleen. Prof. Ravindra Fernando

and Dr. Paramalingam Sivaraja testified to the fact that the Respondent was

in the hospital for 11 days and he was operated and his spleen was removed.

The MLR, the bed head ticket and the diagnoses card of the Respondent was

produced in evidence. The operation was performed under general anesthesia.

It is common sense that a patient haS to suffer pain until the wounds are

healed. Apart from the injuries that he sU3tained due to the accident, he had to

suffer the pain of the surgical wound too.

In assessing damages on personal injuries, Mckerron on Law of Delict

page 117 says that;

In an action for personal injuries that Plaintiff is entitled to claim

compensation for

(1) actual expenditure and pecuniary loss

(2) disfigurement, pain and suffering, and loss of general health

and amenities of life,

(3) future expenses and loss of earning capacity.

In the case of Mahipala and others v. Martin Singho (supra) at page

277 it had been held that;

The only question which remains to be decided is the measure of

damages. R. G. Mc Kerron in 'The Law of Delict", 6th edition at page

209 states thus:

"By the measure of damage is meant the standard or method of

calculation by which the amount of damage is to be

assessed .............. where the injuria is clear, substantial damages

will as a rule be given, although no actual damage is proved"

Wimwlchandra 1. went on further and held at page 279 that;

The Plaintiff can claim compensation not only for the physical injury

that had been occasion by the accident and its aftermath, but also for

the inconvenience and lost of afftenities. This includes the deprivation

of the ability to participate in normal activities in day to day life. This

may also include the deprivation of sexual pleasure, mental suffering

and frustration resulting fi"om the victim's inability to lead a normal

life.

Burchell in "Principles of Delict", Cape Town, Juta & Co. (1993) at

page 136 has this to say on loss (-1 amenities of life-

"The legal concept of amenities of life comprises all the factors which

go to make up an enjoyable human life .............. As Claasen, J, in

Reyneke Vs. Mutual and Federal Insurance Co. Ltd. (5) said:

"The amenities of life flow from the blessings of an unclouded mind,

healthy body, sound limbs and the ability to conduct unaided the basic

functions of life such as running, eating, reading, dressing and

controlling one's bladder and bowels."

In the present case the Respondent was injured due to the accident and

had to undergo an operation. He was in the hospital for 11 days. His pain and

suffering did not come to an end within that period. He testified that he is

suffering an abdominal pain when he is engaged in a heavy labour work such

as lifting heavy items or running for a while. The learned DSG submitted that

Prof. Ravindra Fernando in his report has repeated what the Respondent said

to him and cannot rely on the reporL Prof. Ravindra Fernando said in his

evidence that it is possible that an abdominal pain to continue after an

operation of this nature. It is the person \vho is suffering the pain can only

speak about the actual pain. Prof. Ravindra Fernando's evidence corroborates

the evidenc~ of the accid~nt victim ill relation to the pain. This is a

deprivation of his amenities of life and he must be compensated.

Makerron in his Law of Delict platinum edition page 118 says that

"there are no scales by which pain and suffering can be measured, and there

is no relationship between pain and money which makes it possible to express

the one in terms of the other with any approach to certainty. The usual

method adopted is to take all the circumstances in to consideration and

award substantially an arbitrary sum. " In the instant" case learned District

Judge in his judgment considered the overall evidence on the injuries and has

decided the amount of compensation for injuries. There is no reason to

interfere with this finding.

I I

The next question is whether the Respondent was able to prove the

expenditure incurred. He claims Rs. 50,0001- as pecuniary damages. The

Respondent was unable to submit any document to prove the expenses. The

Respondent had to undergo an operation and it may have been necessary to

keep medical attendant for few days. He may have spent money for travelling

too. He was treated in a government hospital and there is no necessity to

spend money on treatment. Considering these circumstances, I hold that the

learned District Judge's finding that the Respondent may have spend the

amount claimed, that is Rs. 50,0001-, is ~xcessive. I reduce the pecuniary loss

to Rs. 25,000/-.

I award a total sum of Rs. 225,0001- as compensation to the

Respondent.

Subject to the above variation, I affirm the judgment of the learned

District Judge.

The Respondent is entitle to cost of this Court as well as the Court

below.
