The Appellant in this Appeal has sought to impugn the Judgment of

the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota dated 02.09.2003, wherein the

learned High Court Judge had dismissed the Petition of the Appellant.

The Appellant had instituted the said Petition No.12112001 in the

High Court of Hambantota, seeking to quash by way of a Writ of Certiorari

the document dated 04.09.2001 marked as "P 5" issued by the 2nd

Respondent, Agrarian Commissioner of Agrarian Development Hambantota.

The facts as tersely stated in the above Petition are as follows:

One S.D. David Silva was the owner of the land called "Oluwala"

Kumbura and the Appellant is the Anda Cultivator of the land. The said

S.D. David Silva died in 1986 and title was devolved on his wife R.H.

Podinona. As the Anda Cultivator, Appellant was cultivating the said land

under the said R.H. Podinona.

By a letter dated 04.07.2001 (marked as P 3) the Appellant had been

asked to appear before the Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner

for an inquiry under Section 7(7) of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of

2000. At the inquiry only a statement was recorded. Thereafter he received

a letter dated 21.10.2001 (P 5) informing him to quit the land, described in

the schedule, within 30 days.

It was averred that the inquiry that was held was not in respect of the

land that he was cultivating.

Further it was averred that the Appellant was not heard and thereby

the rules of natural justice have not been complied with. Therefore the

Appellant had moved to quash the Order dated 02.09.2003, marked as P5, by

way of a Writ of Certiorari. In contesting the above suit the Respondents

had filed their objections and sought to dismiss the Appellant's Petition on

the reasons mentioned in their objections.

The learned High Court Judge had dismissed the Petition. Being

aggrieved by that judgment the Appellant has preferred this Appeal praying

for the annulling of the said Judgment and praying for the relief prayed for

in the Petition filed in the High Court of Hambantota.

Although the case was scheduled for argument on 13.11.2014, the

parties were absent and unrepresented. Accordingly notices were issued on

the parties and the case was fixed once again for argument for 26.01.2015,

and finally 08.05.2015; the parties were absent and unrepresented.

On examining the Petition filed by the Appellant, it is stated in Para

14 of the Petition, as follows:

"The Appellant states that there is a substantial question of law to be

heard before this Court".

Accordingly, the Appellant had to comply with the Rule 4(2) of the

Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from High Courts) 1988. The Rule

4(2) reads as follows:

4(2) "Where the Appeal is on a matter of law the petition shall contain

a statement of the matter of law to be argued and shall bear a certificate by

an Attorney-at-Law that such matter of law is a fit question for adjudication

by the Court of Appeal".

It is relevant to note that there is no such certificate and further the

grounds of Appeal in the Petition of Appeal was not stated. As such the view

of this Court is that there is no proper Petition of Appeal to adjudicate before

this Court.

Be that as it may, on perusal of the entirety of the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, it is apparent that he has taken into consideration

the submissions made by both parties and has come to the correct conclusion

in dismissing the Petitioner's Petition.

Hence, I do not see any error in which the learned High Court Judge

has considered the facts and the way in which he has applied the law in this

instance.

It is relevant to note, that except the reasons given by the learned High

Court Judge, this Court has noted the following defects of the Petition filed

in the High Court.

(i) The necessary parties had not been cited as the Respondents.

(Specially, in the Petition that the Petitioner had claimed the Anda

rights under the deceased R.D. Podinona. But her heirs had not been

cited as Respondents).

(ii) All the material facts had not been disclosed fully and fairly (at the'

time of filing the Petition, an application had been made to the

Magistrate's Court, by the 2nd Respondent to eject the Petitioner.

That fact had not been disclosed).

(iii) To mislead the Court the Petitioner had filed a purported copy of a

petition filed in the Court of Appeal along with his Petition. A copy

had been sent to the 2nd Respondent also. (It is relevant to note that

there is no number given to that petition, and it is not a certified copy

issued by the Court of Appeal).

For the reasons stated above, the Appeal is dismissed with

costs.
