For the Petitioner.

Priyantha Rajapaksha and Aravinda

Athurupana for the Respondents.

: 05th October, 2015

: 30th May, 2016

The petitioner has filed this application for Revision and Restitution in

Intergrum stating that the judgment, Interlocutory decree and the final decree

with writ of possession are contrary to law and null and void. The petitioner

states that a portion of the petitioner's land had been partitioned without

making him a party to the said partition action. The petitioner submits that the

surveyor's report on the preliminary plan revealed that part of the petitioner's

land had been included in the corpus to the partition action, but still he was

not added as a party to the partition action by the plaintiff respondent or the

District Court. The petitioner stated the dispute was on the southern boundary

of the corpus.

The plaintiff respondent has filed a partition action in 1997 to partition

the land described in the plaint. A preliminary plan bearing no. 1637 was

3

\ ,

submitted to court on a commission issued by court, on an application of the

plaintiff this plan had been returned. Another commission was issued to a

new surveyor and his plan no. 1630 dated 12/05/2003 had been submitted to

court. The surveyor's report stated that one Shelton Perera objected to him

entering his land to survey the corpus. According to this report the petitioner

has encroached the southern boundary of the corpus. The petitioner stated

that the plaintiff respondent failed to make him a party to the said action and

proceeded to partition the land.

The petitioner's counsel submitted that the petitioner made the instant

application to prevent the demolition of his garage which had been wrongfully

included in the corpus to the partition case without including him as a party.

The petitioner stated that the parties to the partition action have acted

collusively and deprived the petitioner a portion of his land.

The counsel for the respondents submitted that the petitioner is guilty of

undue and unexplained delay. The respondents stated that the petitioner

obstructed the preliminary survey in 2003 which shows that he was aware of

the partition action. The respondents argued that the final partition was done

in 2009 but the petitioner has waited till 2011 to file the instant application.

The respondents further stated that the petitioner who is seeking relief in

Restitutio-in-Intergrum has not acted in utmost promptitude which is

mandatory.

The respondents further stated that the petitioner has not complied with

rule 3 of the Court of Appeal rules by not filing the relevant documents with

the petition. The respondents further stated that the petitioner has

misrepresented facts to court, and that the petitioner has not sought leave of

court to tender plan no. 3346 which has been referred to in the District Court

judgment.

The petitioner who claims a part of his land was included in the land

which was partitioned had been aware of the said partition action since the

first survey of the said land. The second survey which was done in 2006 too

refers to the petitioner. According to the two surveyors the petitioner has

encroached the land which was partitioned. The petitioner who had the right

to intervene in the partition action did not do so until the writ of possession

was executed. The petitioner now can not make an application to vacate the

partition decree after sleeping over his rights.

The petitioner failed to disclose fraud or collusion in keeping with

section 48 of the Partition Act. A final decree can only be set aside if fraud or

collusion is proved.

The petitioner has also failed to explain the delay in filing the instant

application. The mere statement that he could not get the certified copies of

the proceedings from court is hard to believe. A party who has been sleeping

over his rights does not get the privilege to invoke the discretionary

jurisdiction of this court.

Since the petitioner is not entitled to the remedy by way of Restitution

the appropriate remedy would have been to act under section 49 of the

Partition Act. In Menchinahamy vs Muniveera the Supreme Court has

decided that Restitution in Intergrum would not be available to a party if that

party had another remedy available

For the afore stated reasons I decide to refuse the application of

the petitioner with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/=.
