DEFENDANT RESPONDENT

RESPONDENTS

: Deepali Wijesundera J.

: M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

: Ranjan Suwandaratne with

Anil Rajakaruna for the

SA Defendant - Petitioner

Saman Galappaththi for the

3rd and 4th Defendant - Respondents

: 02nd October, 2015

: 24th March, 2016

The plaintiff respondent has instituted a partition action bearing

no. pn283 in the District Court of Matara to partition the land described

in the schedule to the plaint. After trial the judgment was delivered on

12/11/1985. An appeal was filed against this judgment which had been 8

(

r

Ii

refused by the appeal court affirming the District Judge's judgment. The

Interlocutory Decrees had been entered and the court had directed to

partition the land. A commission has been issued and the final plan no.

2260 confirmed by court on 29/11/2006. The application of the petitioner

who is the 5th defendant in the District Court was refused by this order

and the final plan was confirmed. The 5th defendant petitioner has filed

this application against the said order.

The petitioner states in his argument that they were enjoying the

main road frontage prior to the institution of the partition case and they

should be given their rights to include their ancestral house and main

road frontage. The petitioner stated that the 3m respondent's rights were

purchase by him pending the partition decree.

The petitioner submitted that the proposed final partition scheme

no. 2260 marked G has caused immense injustice to the petitioners

therefore the said scheme which has been prepared in contravention to

the principles of partition action should be rejected and the surveyor

should be directed to amend the said final scheme.

The counsel for the 3rd and 4A defendant respondents submitted

that the final decree had been entered on 01/01/2007 and writ of

possession has been issued as shown in the journal entries 48 and 49,

9

I

and the final report of the fiscal is also filed, therefore it is settled law that

the finality attached to the Interlocutory Decree and the final decree

under sec. 48 of the Partition Act should not be changed.

The respondents further stated that the petitioners have not

proved that there has been a miscarriage of justice, a grave impropriety,

or violation in the procedure or a fraud or collusion by the parties.

The respondents stated by paragraph 13 of the petition the

petitioner misdirects court to say that the petitioner has purchased the

rights of the 3rd defendant respondent whereas the legal representative

of the 3rd defendant respondent is L.K.H. Arthur Silva who has not

transferred his share to the petitioner, and that the petitioner has

purposely tried to mislead court by the said paragraph.

On perusal of the submissions made by both parties and the

learned District Judge's order I find that the District Judge has carefully

considered the facts placed before him in consideration with the partition

law. The petitioner no where has stated that there was fraud or collusion

involved, when entering the Interlocutory and final decrees. Under sec.

48 of the Partition Act the Interlocutory Decree or Final Decree can only f

10 I

fI1II ;

be altered when a party proves fraud, collusion violation of the procedure

and law, fundamental vice, none of which the petitioner has proved in

the District Court. The petitioner has been an active party to the District

Court case therefore he has to strictly prove that there has been a fraud,

collusion of violation of the procedure or law. The learned District Judge

has considered the facts placed before him and arrived at the

conclusion. I see no reason to set aside a well considered order of the

District Judge. I refuse the application of the petitioner with costs fixed at

Rs. 50,0001= and affirm the District Judges order dated 12/11/1985.
