This is an appeal by the second accused appellant against the

conviction and sentence dated 29/11/2012 by the High Court of

8alapitiya. There have been two accused, they were mother and son

indicted before the High Court.

The accused appellant was convicted under sec. 354 of the Penal

Code for abducting a girl named O.W. Hemamalee.

the accused appellant. She has stated that they are taking a shorter

route. Subsequently the victim was taken to an unknown place and kept

in a house for two days. She has been raped by the first accused on the

second day.

The main ground of appeal urged by the accused appellant was

that the victim's mother was aware that the victim was taken away by the

accused appellant but failed to make a complaint to the police.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the accused

appellant initiated the abduction by taking her in the three wheeler when

the victim was at the bus stand without the consent of the parents. In the

guise of taking her home she was taken to an unknown house and kept

there for two days.

Sec. 352 of the Penal Code provides that;

"Whoever takes or entices any minor under fourteen

years of age if a male, or under sixteen years of age if a

female, or any person of unsound mind, out of the keeping

of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound

mind, without the consent of such guardian, is said to

"kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship","

The learned High Court Judge has dealt with the ingredients to

prove the charge of abduction under sec. 352 of the Penal Code (p 307,

308 of the judgment). On perusal of evidence of the victim we find that

the victim has been alone when she was taken away. Her parents or

guardians were not present at the time she was offered to be taken home.

We are of the view that this constitutes the offence of abduction as

explained in sec. 352 of the Penal Code.

For the afore stated reasons we are not inclined to set aside a well

considered judgment. We affirm the judgment dated 29/11/2012 and

dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
