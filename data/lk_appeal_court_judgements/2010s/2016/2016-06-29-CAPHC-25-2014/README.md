CASE-NO-CA (PHC) 25/ 2014- JUDGMENT- 24.06.2016

P.R.Waigama, J

The instant appeal is to review the impugned orders of the

Learned High Court Judge, dated 07.05.2014 and order of the

Learned Magistrate dated 29.06.2012 by setting aside and

vacating the same.

The facts germane to the instant appeal stems from a dispute

which was likely to cause breach of the peace between the

Petitioner and the Respondent. Initially a complaint was made

by the Petitioner, alleging that the 1 st Respondent had

obstructed the road way which he was using as a access to

his house.

The said road way was over the Respondent's Seven acre land

in which he has cultivated cinnamon.

Although the Petitioner has made a complaint to the police

they did not file an information in terms of Section 66 of

Primary Court Act No 44 of 1979.

Hence the Petitioner has tendered the petition in terms of

Section 66(1)(b) of the above Act, of the alleged dispute;

The Petitioner has asserted the following in the said petition;

3

That he had been using a 10 foot road way from the

boundary of the land belonging to the Respondent.

That the said road has been used over 40 years and had

prescribed to the said road way.

Further alleges that the dispute arose due to the fact the

Respondent obstructing the road way by cutting the branches

of a tree putting across the said road way.

It is the categorical position of the Petitioner that he has no

alternative road way, and as such out of necessity he had

been using the disputed road way.

In opposing the above application of the Petitione the

Respondent asserts the fact that the Petitioner had never

used a ten feet wide road way, but had used a road which

is wide only six feet. Further it is stated that the Petitioner

had been using a road way on to the Western boundary of the

Respondent's land.

Further it is stated by the Respondent that the Petitioner has

an alternative access and as such he cannot claim this road

way, as a necessity.

It is apparent from the facts revealed, that the alleged dispute

arose in respect of a road way, and determination of the said

issue has to be in accordance with Section 69 (1) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act, which states thus;

" 69 (1) where the dispute relates to any right to any land

or any part of a land, other than the right to possession of

4

such land or part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall

determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the

subject of the dispute and make an order under subsection

(2)."

It was also the contention of the Respondent that there is a

Partition case in which the alleged road way is a part of the

land sought to be partitioned. But it said that the petitioner

has never intervened to vindicate his rights in the said

partition case. Further in perusing the documents marked 2P2,

2P3,2P4 the Learned Magistrate was of the view that the said

documents do not depict an existence of the alleged road way.

The Learned Magistrate has also held that any order made

under Section 66 of the Primary Court Act, will not be a bar

for any determination to be taken in a Civil Court. Any action

under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act is to

make order to preserve the peace between the parties to the

dispute till a competent court decides the rights of the

parties. Therefore any order made by a Magistrate in terms of

the Primary Court Act will be only a temporary order which

is not capable of deciding the rights of the parties thereto.

Further it was the opinion of the Learned Magistrate that

mere fact that the said plans do not depict a road way does

not exclude the fact that disputed road way was not in

existence, and therefore the Learned Magistrate was persuaded

to reject the said argument of the Respondent.

5

It was the contention of the Respondent that the a temporary

road way was allowed for the Petitioner to be used only for

the purpose of taking his mothers corps and for the alms

giving, for the monks to come to the house of the Petitioner.

But nevertheless it was observed by the Learned Magistrate

that the disputed road was not given and was cleared for the

purpose of the Petitioner's mother's funeral but as per

photograph marked P6 it indicates that there had been a clear

road way in existence.

In addition to the facts stated above the Learned Magistrate

has also adverted to the investigation report of the police,

which is a clear indication of the fact that the Petitioner had

been using the alleged road way. But it contended by the

Respondent that the Petitioner was using a paddy bund and

not the disputed road way.

The Learned Magistrate has also considered the Respondent's

position as to the existence of the road way. The Respondent

asserts the fact that the said road was used for the purpose

of transporting cinnamon from the land to the tractor. But it

is commented by the Learned Magistrate that if that was the

case there was no necessity to have the said road open up to

the petitioner's house.

The learned Magistrate was also satisfied with the documents

tendered by the petitioner viz, P17 and P19 and also the

photograph tendered by the Petitioner as the above said

document had proved the fact that the Petitioner had been

using the disputed road way.

6

It was observed by the Learned Magistrate that although the

Petitioner has made a statement to the Police that he was

using a 10 feet wide road way, in fact he had used a road

only 4 feet wide, and made order until a competent court

makes an order, in respect of this disputed road the Petitioner

could use the said road way without any obstruction.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent- Petitioner

made an application in revision to have the said impugned

vacate or set aside.

The Learned High Judge by his order dated 07.05.2014, has

dismissed the Respondent-Petitioner's Revision application on the

basis that no extraordinary grounds averred for the High Court

to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction, and no documentary

proof of the said partition case has been tendered. Hence the

Learned High Court Judge was of the view that the

Respondent- Petitioner has alternative remedy to resolve the

alleged dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court

Judge the Respondent- Petitioner appealed to this court to have

the said order set aside or vacate.

It is intensely relevant to note that the mere fact, a civil

action is pending in the District Court, will not fettered a

Magistrate to make any order in respect of an application

filed under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The above principle was recognised in the case of

KANAGASABE .VS. MAILWAGANAM- 78 NLR- 280.

7

..

For the above compelling reasons this Court is of the view

that the Respondent- Appellant has not satisfied this Court as

to why the orders of the Learned High Court Judge and the

Magistrate should be set aside.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed, costs fixed at Rs. lO,OOOj.
