The plaintiff respondent has instituted a case in the District Court

of KegalJe against the defendant praying for a declaration of title and

ejectment of the defendant from the land described in the schedule to

the plaint. The disputed land had been allotted by way of a grant to the

plaintiff respondent's father H.R. Mohotti Appuhamy in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance. The plaintiff's father has nominated him as the

nominee and the mother as the successor to the land. This has been

admitted by the defendant in the District Court but the defendant

claimed rights under prescription and also by way of inheritance. The

2

learned District Judge after trial has delivered the judgment on

18/09/1997 in favour of the plaintiff but has allocated % acre of land to

the fourth respondent on the basis of prescription. Being aggrieved by

the said judgment the defendant has filed this appeal against same.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the plaintiff

respondent in his plaint in the District Court has sought declaration of

title for two blocks of land described in the schedules to the plaint which

the defendant's possessed separately since they are two different

blocks, which makes it two different causes of action. The appellants

stated that the District Court erred in law by coming to the conclusion

that the action could be maintained together which is contrary to the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

The appellant submitted that the first respondent never

possessed the land though he claimed paper title, and that he has not

registered his nomination after the death of his father. The appellant

stated that the respondent had failed to prove his paper title or his

possession of the land in the District Court. The appellant further stated

that the respondent failed to prove his uninterrupted possession under

Sec. 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

3

The respondent's counsel argued that the respondent succeeded

to the land upon the death of his father in terms of Sec. 49 of the Land

Development Ordinance. The learned counsel further stated that since

the nomination of the respondent is admitted and not challenged by the

defendant appellant it has to be decided whether the land had been

identified, and whether the plaintiff respondent could unite two or more

causes of action in the same case and whether the plaintiff respondent

failed to succeed to the land by not entering the land for possession

within six months of his father's death. He stated that there was no

dispute in identification of the land in the District Court.

On the argument on whether two or more causes of action could

be united in the same action. He stated that under Sec. 36 (1) of the

Civil Procedure Code it could be done. He further submitted that in

terms of Sec. 37 of the Civil Procedure Code the appellant is estopped

from taking this objection since it was not raised in the District Court.

The respondent stated under Sec. 68 (2) of the Land

Development Ordinance though it is stated the nominee has to take

possession within six months of the death of the person who nominated

him the respondent was prevented by the defendant appellant by

forcibly entering the said land and taking possession of the same.

The counsel for the respondent stated that the District Judge had

erred in holding that the fourth defendant had prescribed to the land

when one can not prescribe to any land given on a grant.

Sec. 161 of the Land Development Ordinance states;

II No person shall by possession of any land alienated on a

permit or a grand acquire any prescriptive title thereto

against any other person or against the Crown".

The appellant can not claim any prescriptive rights to the land in

issue therefore the argument of the appellant on prescription fails.

The appellant stated that lots 25 and 75 are two different lands

and both can not be included in one case as the corpus. These two

blocks are shown in one plan and both are given on a grant to the

plaintiff respondent's father by the Crown. This argument fails in terms

of Sec. 37 of the Civil Procedure Code since they failed to take this up in

the District Court. Also the identification of the land was not disputed in

the District Court.

5

The learned District Judge has carefully analyzed the evidence

and documents placed before the District Court. This court can not

interfere where the evidence has been properly evaluated. On the other

hand there are no legitimate legal reasons to allow the appeal of the

appellant.

For the afore stated reasons the appeal of the appellant is refused

with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
