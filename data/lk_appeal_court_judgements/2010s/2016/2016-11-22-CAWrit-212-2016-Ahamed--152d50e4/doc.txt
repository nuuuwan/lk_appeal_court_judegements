VIJITH K. MALALGODA PC J (PICA)

The petitioner's position in this case was entirely depended

on the service minute which is produced marked 'PI0' to the petition.

The petitioner's position is that according to the item 8 in Appendix 5 of

the service minute for the Post of Zonal Director of Education the method

of selection should be by the Provincial Education Authorities. However

his complaint was that the Provincial Public Service Commission of the

Eastern Province had called for applications for the said post and

advertised the Zonal Director of Education Post in Ampara division. In

support of his position the learned Counsel had filed the similar notice

issued by the Uwa Provincial Council when they called for the Zonal

Director of Education Post and the said application had been issued by

the Secretary to the Ministry of Education of the Uwa Provincial Council.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 3rd and 5th

respondents and the learned Counsel appearing for the 1 st, 2nd and 4th

respondents raised number of preliminary objections. Out of their

objections raised, we observe that according to the provisions of the

Provincial Councils Act the appointments to the Provincial Councils are

vested with the Governor of that province. This position is clear under

Section 32(1) of the said Act and under Section 32(2) of the said Act the

Governor may delegate such powers to the Provincial Public Service

Commission. Under Section 32 (2)(a) the said powers delegated to the

Provincial Public Service Commission may delegate to the Chief Secretary

or any officer of the Provincial Public Service of that province. As

observed by this Court even though the service minute may require the

method of selection should be by the Provincial Education Authorities

what the Provincial Council has to follow is the provisions in the

Provincial Councils Act and under the provisions of Section 32 if there is

a provincial appointment, the appointment has to be governed by Section

32 of the Provincial Councils Act and therefore the appointing authority

of the said province is the Provincial Governor and if he has delegated

such powers to the Provincial Public Service Commission then the

appointing authority is the Provincial Public Service Commission. In the

present case it is clear that the Governor had appointed the Provincial

Public Service Commission and in the said circumstances, the

appointing authority should be the Provincial Public Service Commission

and when considering this position placed before this Court we observe

that the impugned decision which was challenged before this Court had

been issued by following the correct provisions of the Provincial Councils

Act by the Provincial Public Service Commission.
