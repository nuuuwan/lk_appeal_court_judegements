Petitioner to the present application JV Goakal (Ceylon) Private Limited had come before this court

seeking inter alia,

a) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the direction dated 19.09.2012 (P-

30) of the 151 and 2nd Respondents to the Petitioner to pay the amount of Rs. 627200/-

b) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 151 and 2nd Respondents

from seeking to recover any money as EPF contributions in respect of the 3rd Respondent.

Petitioner a limited liability company duly incorporated in Sri Lanka is a fully owned subsidiary of

J.V. Overseas Trading Limited a Company based in Dubai. According to the Petitioner, the Petitioner

Company was established in the year 2003 with an initial investment of US $ 5 Million and was

engaged in the business of processing, blending, packing and exporting value added Sri Lankan tea.

Petitioner has employed the 3rd respondent as its executive director at its inception since 23.06.2003

and the said post was one of the two highest and equal ranking positions in the Petitioner Company.

The other equal ranking post of Director was held by one Vijith Perera.

As submitted by the Petitioner before this court the 3rd Respondent, prior to his appointment as the

executive director of the Petitioner Company, was serving as a consultant to the J.V. Overseas Trading

Company, the parent company of the Petitioner based in Hong Kong and therefore the parent company

of the Petitioner reposed much trust on the 3rd Respondent.

The present application arises from a direction of the 2nd Respondent relating to the non-payment of

dues under Employees Provident Fund Act No.15 of 1958 to the 3rd Respondent by the Petitioner

Company.

As submitted by the Petitioner before this court an inquiry into the non- payment of Employees

Provident Fund contribution was initiated after the 3rd Respondent's services were terminated by the

new management of the Petitioner Company. Prior to his termination the 3rd Respondent was placed as

the Vice President, International Marketing and Business (Middle East Region) with effect from

16.06.2005 after removing him from his previous position pending an independent audit quarry by

Messrs BDO Burah Hathy and Company.

As a result of the said Audit quarry several serious acts of misconduct was revealed and the services of

the 3rd Respondent was subsequently terminated by giving reasons for his termination (P-8). A

complaint was made at the Criminal Investigations Department with regard to misappropriation of

funds belonging to the Petitioner Company and it was revealed during the argument that the 3rd

Respondent was served with an indictment in the High Court of Colombo.

As observed by this court the 3rd Respondent had complained to the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioner

Company has failed to make both, the employees and Employers contribution and thereby acted in

violation of the provisions of the Employees Provident Fund.

In this regard, I wish to first consider the position taken up by the Petitioner before this court.

According to the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent held one of the senior most managerial and

supervisory position in Petitioner Company and there was no other person within the country that

oversaw the 3rd Respondent's discharge of his duties which included the remitting of the EPF

contribution of the employees of the company including the EPF contributions of the 3rd Respondent.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the 3rd Respondent being the person who oversaw the remitting

of EPF contributions of the employees had abused his managerial authority and taking advantage of

the fact that there was no one in Sri Lanka to oversee his function, directed that no deduction shall be

made from his salary as the employee contribution of EPF and has in fact collected that amount as part

of his monthly salary.

In support of the above contention Petitioner has produced marked P-15 pay slips of the 3rd

Respondent for the months of November and December 2004, February, June ,July August,

September, October, November and December 2005 which indicates that the 3rd Respondent had

collected his salary without the 8% employee contribution of the EPF payment.

It is further observed by this court that the 3rd Respondent has not been registered with the Employees

Provident Fund, to obtain an EPF number to make the contribution.

However the Petitioner has produced marked P-14 the Receipts issued by Employees Provident Fund,

with regard to the payment made by the Petitioner to the EPF during this period.

In support of his contention the Petitioner has further submitted an affidavit marked P-16 from the

Manager- Administration of the Petitioner Company and according to his affidavit, on the instructions

of the 3rd Respondent and Mr. Perera who was the other Director, no contribution was made to the

Employees Provident Fund on behalf of them, but, Employees Provident Fund contribution for all the

other employees were made by the Petitioner Company, since both the 3rd Respondent and Mr. Perera

I

ranked on par with each other in the Petitioner Company during this period and there was no one

competent to override their decisions at that time.

When the new management took over the management, of the Petitioner Company after appointing the

3rd Respondent as the vice president, the Petitioner Company has started contributing to the EPF on

behalf of the 3rd Respondent. In support of the above position, the Petitioner has produced documents

marked P-19 and P-20.

From the above evidence placed before this court, it is clear, that the non-payment of EPF contribution

with regard to the 3rd Respondent was an act initiated by the 3rd Respondent himself, in order to collect

his full salary without any deduction (employee contribution).

Therefore it is further observed by this court that the complaint made by the 3rd Respondent to the 2nd

Respondent too was incorrect since the 3rd Respondent has collected the employee contribution of the

3rd Respondent by himself without allowing that to be deducted from his salary using his authority in

the Petitioner Company.

However during the Argument the Learned State Counsel representing the lSI and 2nd Respondents

took up the position that the 2nd Respondent is the government officer statutorily charged with the

responsibility of protecting the interest of the work force of Sri Lanka who suffers continued

exploitation of unscrupulous employers. As such the Commissioner of Labour in keeping with his role

as the sentinel of this nation's labour force, will be justifiably reluctant to make an adverse order

against an employee unless there is cogent material whose credibility has been established under the

same standards that would be applied in a court of law.

Even though the above argument of the counsel for the 1 sl and the 2nd Respondents is acceptable in

general terms, the decisions of the 2nd Respondent in the present case cannot be justified by the said

argument. As observed by this court, 'C' forms produced marked P-13 clearly indicates that the

Petitioner has duly paid the EPF contributions for all his employees except the two Directors and

therefore one cannot argue that the 3rd Respondent and the other director of the Petitioner Company

was subject to exploitation by the Petitioner Company.

Section 16 of the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 reads as follows,

Section 16;

Where contributions payable under this Act in respect of any month have not been made to the

Fund before the last day of the succeeding month and the employer is unable to explain to the

satisfaction of the Commissioner that the failure to pay such contribution was due to

circumstances beyond his control, he shall be liable to pay to the fund in addition to the amount

of the contributions due, a surcharge on such amount calculated in the following manner,

d. where the contributions are in arrears for a period exceeding six months, a surcharge of

twenty five per centum of the amount of the contributions due.

When considering the material placed before this court, this court is in agreement with the Petitioner

when he argued, that when imposing a surcharge of 193, 200/- the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have

failed to realize the above provision during the inquiry conducted by them.

In this regard the proceedings of the inquiry conducted by the Respondents are before us produced

marked P-23 by the Petitioner and the Respondents have not denied the said document in their

objections before this court. When going through the said report, it is observed by us that the inquiring

officer has failed to realize the importance of Section 16 of the Employees Provident Fund Act No 15

of 1958 and to consider whether the Employer has explained before him that the failure to pay such

contribution was due to circumstances beyond his control.

In this regard we are mindful of the decision by the Supreme Court in Hapuarachchi and Others V,

Commissioner of Elections and Others 2009 (1) Sri LR 01, where the Supreme Court ordered the

Respondent to re consider the application submitted by the Petitioners and to give reasons for his

decision following such re consideration.

It is further observed by this court that the 1 sl and the 2nd Respondents have misdirected themselves

when they conclude that the Petitioner has to pay the employer contribution of Rs. 173 600/- as part of

EPF arrears to the 3rd Respondent when it was clear that the 3rd Respondent had collected the same

fraudulently from the Petitioner during his employment with the Petitioner, but the inquiry officer has

failed to give his mind to this aspect during the inquiry.

However this court is of the view that the Petitioner is liable under the Employees Provident Fund Act

No.15 of 1958 to make a payment of Rs.266, 400/- as the Employer contribution to the 3rd

Respondent.

For the reason set out above, this court decides to issue a Mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

as prayed in paragraph (ii) of the Petition quashing the impugned decision of the 1 Sl and 2nd

Respondents dated 19.09.2012 (P-30) by which the Petitioner was ordered to pay Rs. 627, 200/-.

This court is not inclined to issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition as prayed in paragraph

(iii) to the Petition for the reasons discussed above. 1 sl and 2nd Respondents are free to hold a fresh

inquiry having in minded the observations made by this court in the present case.
