Malinie Gunaratne, J.

Persuant to an Affidavit filed by the Petitioner - Respondent -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) in the Magistrate's

Court of Elpitiya in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act,

the learned Primary Court Judge held an inquiry into the dispute between

Respondent and Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellant) in respect of a roadway.

On 03.09.2004 the learned Magistrate held, that the Respondent has a

right to the disputed roadway and therefore she is entitled to use it.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant had preferred a

Revision Application to the High Court of Balapitiya. The learned High

Court Judge after having heard the submissions of Counsel for the respective

parties, by his Judgment dated 26.06.2008 dismissed the Revision

Application.

The Appellant has filed this Appeal seeking to set aside the said

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 26.06.2008.

When this case was taken up for argument on 10.08.2015, the

Appellant was absent and unrepresented although notices had been issued on

her and the registered attorney on several occasions. As such the Court

heard only the arguments of the Counsel for the Respondent.

The salient facts relating to the dispute between the two parties are

briefly set out as follows:

The Respondent has made a complaint to the Police against the

Appellant's husband for obstructing the use of a roadway that she had been

using for the past 19 years.

The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the Respondent

was, the learned Magistrate has clearly addressed his mind to the issue and

has accepted the version of the Respondent and held in favour of her.

In an inquiry where the dispute relates to any right to any land other

than right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to

Section 69( 1), is who is entitled to the right which is the subject of the

dispute. The ambit and the operation of the law is clearly and

unambiguously set out in the case of Ramalingam vs. Thangarajah (1982) 2

SLR 693. It was held the word "entitle" here connotes the ownership of the

right".

In the instant case the learned Magistrate's VIew was, that the

Respondent has a right to use the roadway in dispute and ordered the

recently planted cinnamon plantation be removed.

The learned President's Counsel submitted that the learned Magistrate

has correctly decided that the Respondent has a right to use the roadway in

dispute. As such there were no valid grounds to disturb the findings of the

learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed

the Revision Application filed by the Appellant.

On perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is

apparent that the learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration the

5

affidavits and documents filed by both parties in the Magistrate's Court and

had come to the aforesaid conclusion.

As such, I do not see any wrong in the manner in which the learned

High Court Judge has considered the facts and the way in which he has

applied the law in this instance.

It is relevant to note, that the Appellant has not sought to set aside the

Order made by the learned Magistrate.

F or the above stated reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the

Judgment made by the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, I affirm the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 26.06.2008 and dismiss the

Appeal.
