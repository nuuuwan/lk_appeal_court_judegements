against the order of

24.11.1998, and the

Court Judge dated

The facts of the case need mention In brief to

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (in short the

the Defaulter - Petitioner - Appellant (in short the

As the Appellant defaulted the payment of the said

amount as tax the Respondent instituted action In

the Magistrate Court Maligakanda, in case No. 57020,

In terms of Section 247 of the said Municipal

Council Ordinance.

Pursuant to the afore said the Magistrate issued

summons to the accused (appellant) to appear and

show cause as to why he should not pay the said

amount to the Respondent.

At the very inception of the proceedings the

Appellant raised a preliminary Issue as to the

maintainability of the Respondent's action as the

same was barred by prescription.

In that it is said that Respondent has not made

the alleged complaint within SIX months after the

date that the payment was due, and that 1t IS

obnoxious to Section 308 of the Municipal Council

Ordinance. Further it is also alleged by the Appellant

that In terms of Section 247 B the Respondent can

levy an annual tax only on an industry, and not on

a trade or business of maintaining a showroom.

The Learned Magistrate has dealt with the issues as

stated above in the following manner, to vit that the

question of prescription has been already decided In

the case of NAOTIUNNA .VS. REVENUE OFFICER to

the effect that the said Section 308 has no bearing

In a matter of this nature. Hence the Learned

4

Magistrate has over ruled the objection raised by the

Appellant.

The gravamen of the Appellant 1S that he 1S not

carry1ng on a trade or karmantaya 1n the said

prem1ses which comes within the limits of Colombo

Municipal Council, but he 1S carry1ng on a business

of selling jewellery at the afore said business

prem1ses.

The Learned Magistrate has approached the

contentious issue, by having recourse to the judicial

pronouncements 1n similar matters. The cumulative

effect of those decisions were that the Magistrate is

not empowered to look In to the propriety of the

Claimant's application but to recover the amount

stated therein as a fine and credit the money to

the Respondent's account. Therefore the Learned

Magistrate has held that he 1S bound by the said

judgments and had dismissed the application

Respondent- Petitioner-Appellant on merits.

~hc

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner-

Appellant went 1n reV1SIOn to the High Court to

have the said order set aside.

The Learned High Court Judge 1n dealing with the

pivotal 1ssue has adverted to the Memorandum of

Association of Crest Gems Ltd, (Petitioner) and has

held that the Respondent -Petitioner 1S engaged 1n

the business as manufacture and exporters of articles

5

of jewellery. Manufacturing of articles of

within the terms 'Karmanthaya'. In the

it was held that the manufacturing

jewellery falls

above setting

of articles of

jewellery falls within the term of 'karmanthaya.'

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner-

Appellant has appealed to this Court to have the

said orders of the Learned Magistrate and the

Learned High Court Judge set aside /vacate.

It IS the contention of the Appellant that as per

Section 247 B of the Municipal Council Ordinance

can only Impose a tax In respect of an 'industry'

and not on a 'trade'

But it IS contended by the Respondent that the

in terpretation of 'karmanthaya' , includes mInIng,

agriculture, trade, (velandama) etc.

It IS intensely relevant to note

interpretation of the above Section

English version.

that the

vary In the

For better appreciation of the above Section 247 B IS

reproduce here under;

(1) A Municipal Council may Impose and levy a tax

on any trade carried on within the administrative

limits of that Council,

(2)The tax levied under subsection (1) shall be

annual tax determined by the Council according

6

to the annual value of the premIses on which

that trade is carried on ....

It IS asserted by the Appellant that the Respondent

can Impose a tax only In respect of a

'Karmanthaya' as stated In the Sinhala text. It IS

pertinent to note that the Municipal Council

Ordinance does not gIve an in terpretation to the

word 'Karmanthaya'. Therefore the Respondent adverted

to the dictionary meanIng of the said word

'Karmanthaya'

It is contended by the Respondent that In the case

cited by the Appellant to vito CREST GEMS LIMITED

.VS. THE COLOMBO MUNICIPAL COUNCIL- 2003 1 SLR-

370- Her Ladyship has not considered the dictionary

meanIng of Karmanthaya, and hence this Court IS

not bound to follow the same. Moreover it is stated

that the judgments marked as X2,X4,XS cannot be

glVen any weight as there IS no dicta for this

Court to follow.

Therefore the Respondent has adverted Court to the

l' t' of 'INDUSTR"Jn . GlC lOnary meanIng

Velandama, viyaparaya, Karmanthaya. Hence it is crystal

clear the word TRADE means KARMANTHAYA, which

also means velandama (business) or sale.

In the said assertion it is the categorical position of

the Respondent that the word Karman thaya IS

synonymous with trade, business.

..

It IS common ground that the Appellant IS dealing

In manufacture and export of gems. It IS for the

said purpose the Respondent- Appellant IS carryIng on

the said business In the said premIses within the

limits of Colombo Municipality limits.

Therefore In the above exposition of facts and law

relating to the said issue this Court is of the VIew

that same has rendered this appeal infructuous.

Hence in the wake of the determination made herein

above, we are of the unhesitant opinion that the

challenge laid in the instant appeal lacks in IHeriLs,

and thus should stand dismissed.

Appeal IS dismissed subject to a cost of Rs.

10,000/ .
