Vijith K.Malalgoda P.C.J. (PICA)

This application is coming up for objection today. However

Learned State Counsel appearing kr the respondent informs that the

v respondents would not be filing objections in this matter and will

abide by the decision of this Court. She further submits that there

was another writ application pending before this Court with regard to

the same subject matter and in the said writ application this Court

had held that the land referred to this application is a private land

and not a state land. The said decision is before this Court marked

P10. We observe the order marked P10 referred to a C.A. Writ

application No.2033/2005. In the said order delivered by Hon.

Sripavan , J. (as he was then) has specifically says that the said land

"Galagoda Henayaya" referred to the document marked 1R1 .if is a

private land.

The petitioner when commg before this Court by present

application has challenged the document P11 seeking a writ of

certiorari in order to quash the said document Pll. Going through

the document Pll we observe that the said document is a notice

issued under the State Land Recovery of Possession of Law to obtain

possession with regard to the Land "Galgoda Henyaya". Therefore it

is clear that the respondent are now trying to take vacant possession

of the same land which was the subject matter to an application

before this Court previously namely C.A. Writ application

No.2033/2005.

Considering the submissions made by the learned State

Counsel as well as considering the documents in PI0 and Pll before

this Court, we decide to grant relief as prayed by the petitioner in

prayer "b" and "C" to his petition. We therefore issue a writ of

certiorari to quashing the notice to quit dated 25/3/2015 as marked

as Pll and a writ of prohibition prohibiting the 1st respondent from

taking any action to eject the petitioner as stated in the document

marked Pll.

Application is allowed.
