ORDER RELATING TO THE APPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION

P Padman Surasena J

In this order, the party who has filed the petition instituting this writ

application at the first instance, will be referred to as the Petitioner. The

parties who have been named as Respondents in the said original writ

12

application will be referred to as the Respondents. The parties who

subsequently seek to intervene after this writ application was filed will be

referred to as Intervenient Parties.

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2016-08-02

before us, agreed to file their written submissions and requested this Court

to pronounce the order pertaining to the applications for intervention after

considering the written submissions, dispensing with their necessity of

making oral submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based on the

material adduced by the parties in their pleadings and written submissions.

The parties who have filed written submissions to substantiate the

respective positions taken up by them have relied on number of case laws.

Out of the judgments cited by parties some support the view that an

application for intervention in a writ application could be considered, while

the others support the view that such an application for interventions in a

writ application is not possible.

Superior courts of this country have from time to time considered these

judgments at number of occasions. This is clear from the numerous

judgments above referred to cited by the parties in this case. Thus, it is not

the intention of this court at this stage to reconsider this aspect of law at

13

this moment also. This is particularly so as a Divisional Bench of this court

has decided this issue in the case of Weerakoon and another vs

Bandaragama Pradeshiya Sabhawa {C A Writ Application No. 586/2007

[(Decided on 2011-11-22) (2012 BLR 310)]}.

After consideration of the relevant judgments the said Divisional Bench of

this court has held that the Court of Appeal Rules 1990 do not provide for

third party interventions in applications for Prerogative Writs.

Thus this court is not in a position at this moment to entertain any of these

applications by third parties for intervention in this proceedings since this is

a proceeding with regard to an application for prerogative writs.

No further writing is necessary in this judgment as the issue to be decided

here namely the question whether or not this court should permit the

applications for interventions could be decided as has been decided above.

However this court would for the sake of completeness proceed to observe

the followings as well.

It would be relevant at this stage to bear in mind that it is the following

main reliefs that the Petitioner has sought from this court in her

application:

a) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

of the Sri Lanka Medical Council refusing to register the Petitioner as

a medical practitioner;

b) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to compel the Sri

Lanka Medical Council to register the Petitioner as a medical

practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Council as

amended;

c) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition to prevent the Sri

Lanka Medical Council from refusing to register the Petitioner as a

medical practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Ordinance

as amended;

d) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

. of the Sri Lanka Medical Council refusing provisional registration to

the Petitioner;

e) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to compel the Sri

Lanka Medical Council to register the Petitioner provisionally as a

15

medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical

Ordinance as amended;

f) a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition to prevent the Sri

Lanka Medical Council from refusing to register the Petitioner

provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the

Medical Ordinance as amended;

1 st, 2nd and 3rd Intervenient Parties in their petition and the joint affidavit

do not disclose adequate acceptable basis for their intervention in this

proceedings.

4th and 5th Intervenient Parties are respectively, the president and the

secretary of the Government Dental Surgeons' Association. In the joint

affidavit filed by them they do not disclose any acceptable basis for

intervention in this proceedings. The grounds they have put forward in

paragraphs 13 and 14 of their affidavit cannot be accepted as a basis to

justify their intervention in this proceedings.

6th Intervenient Party is the Government Dental Surgeons' Association and

hence it would follow from the above conclusion (with regard to 4th and 5th

16

Intervenient parties) that there is no acceptable basis for the 6th

Intervenient Party also to intervene in this proceedings.

8th and 9th intervenient parties namely All Ceylon Medical officers'

Association and its secretary respectively. They too have not adduced any

acceptable basis as to why their intervention in this application should be

necessary.

In the petition and the affidavit filed by the 10th Intervenient Party which is

the Government Medical Officers' Association also does not disclose any

acceptable basis as to why they should intervene in this application.

ih Intervenient Party Dr. S Terrence G R De Silva is the current Registrar

of the 1st Respondent Sri Lanka Medical Council. He is seeking to intervene

in this application for the reason that several allegations have been made

against him and his daughter in the application filed by the Petitioner. He

has referred to paragraph 24 (d) of the petition and in his affidavit filed in

this proceeding~, had sought to answer the allegations lev~led against him

by the Petitioner, in paragraph 24 (d) of the Petition.

17

While the Petitioner in his written submissions has admitted making this

allegation against this Intervenient Party, the course of action he has

suggested is for this Intervenient Party to hand over an affidavit answering

this allegation through the 1st Respondent of which he is the Registrar.

However, question arises as to what would happen if such opportunity was

not afforded to this Intervenient Party by the 1st Respondent as 1st

Respondent would only be concerned about his interest in this case and

may not necessarily be the private interests of this Intervenient Party in his

private capacity.

It stands to reason that a party against whom an allegation is made must

be afforded an opportunity of defending himself.

The Petitioner has made allegations against a party without making that

party a respondent to the proceedings, although that party has made an

application, this court cannot allow that party to intervene, in view of the

ruling of the Divisional Benc;:h above mentioned.

The Petitioner is free to consider making this party a Respondent if he is so

advised that such a course of action wou~d be necessary to avoid problems

18

that might arise in this proceedings as a result of this party being not made

a respondent.

The law governing an application for prerogative writs is governed by a

regime of administrative law which has its own specific grounds for the

issuance of a writ. Therefore once an applicant satisfies court of the

existence of such grounds court in its discretion would decide whether or

not to issue the writs applied for. It would be a pre-requisite for the

Petitioner to make necessary parties as respondents. This would be in his

own interest particularly when he is interested in getting the court to make

an adverse finding against such party.

The position taken up by the Petitioner with regard to the application for

intervention made by the 10th, 11th and 1ih Intervenient Parties is that

they could be heard in this proceedings in the event this court is inclined to

grant their applications for intervention as they are also similarly

circumstanced parties because they are also students of the 2nd

Respondent institution who have been affected by the action of the 1st

Respondent.

19

10th 11th and lih intervenient parties may not be the only other students

of the 2nd Respondent institution. If anybody has required grounds which

could be established to the satisfaction of court he or she is free to invoke

the writ jurisdiction of this court subject to, and in accordance with law.

If they file separate applications to obtain the identical reliefs on the

identical grounds, this court may deal with those cases also in an

appropriate way.

However in view of the ruling of the Divisional Bench of this court above

referred to, we desist ourselves from allowing this application as well.

For the foregoing reasons we decide to refuse the applications for

intervention made by all Intervenient Parties.

Applications for interventions refused.

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC 1

I had the opportunity of going through the Order of

Justice Surasena above. When considering the question of intervention,

Justice Surasena was guided by the decision of the Divisional Bench of this

court in the case of Weerakoon and Another V. Banadaragama

Pradeshiya Sabhawa (CA Writ Application No. 586/2007 decided

on 2011.11.22) 2012 BLR 310.

As observed by Justice Surasena, Superior Courts have considered this

issue on several occasions and different views have been taken in those

cases. As I have previously observed in one of my orders, I have identified

two different schools of thought, one being the strict adherence to the

rules and other the liberalized approach and preferred to follow the

liberalized approach. However at the time I decided to follow the said

approach, it was not brought to my notice by the parties, of the decision in

the Divisional Bench and if I was aware of the above decision I wouldn't

have deviated from the said decision. I therefore agree with Justice

Surasena when he decided to follow the decision in the Divisional Bench of

this Court.
