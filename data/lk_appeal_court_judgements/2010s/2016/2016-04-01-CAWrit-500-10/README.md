The petitioners institute this action seeking a writ of certiorari to

quash paragraph 6 and 7 Of the Public Administration Circular No.

16/2008 dated 22.08.2008 marked P 13.

The petitioners were officers of the Middle Level Unified

Technical Service (MLTS) and later promoted to the Sri Lanka

Agricultural Service (SLAGS). The ML TS was thereafter restructured

and named as Sri Lanka Technological Service (SL TS). The salary of the

members of the SLAGS was always on a higher scale than the SL TS.

Time to time the Government has increased the salaries of public

services, but maintained the hierarchical structure of it. With the P .A.

Circular No.30/99 (1) dated 07.02.2000 marked P 9, the starting salary of

the officers in SL TS was made higher than the officers of the SLAGS.

After making several representations to the authorities concern, the

anomaly was rectified by circular No. 16/2008 dated 22.08.2008 marked

P 13, but the arrears were given only from 01.09.2008. The petitioners'

argument is although that they were placed above oth.ers in hierarchical

structure in the service, lesser salary was paid to them from 01. 07.1994 to

01.09.2008 and it was not rectified. The Petitioners contention is that the

decision to pay the arrears of salary from 01.09.2008 is ultra vires, has

been made without jurisdiction, arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable and

'} 3

irrational, illegal, violates legitimate expectations of them, and is in abuse

of discretion. They move this Court to issue a writ of certiorari to quash a

part of the circular marked P 13 where the arrears had been limited to

01.09.2008. (Paragraph 5 and 6 of the said circular)

The State Counsel raised a preliminary objection that the National

Salary and Carder Commission is a necessary party and it has not been

made a party to the application. State further objected on the basis that the

salary revision and the date of it coming in to operation is a policy matter.

The budgetary capacity of the Government is considered by the National

Salary and Carder Commission and the effective date has been decided to

be the 01.09.2008. State further argued that a part of a circular cannot be

quashed.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner in his written submission

submitted a lengthy argument that failure to give reasons to an

administration decision makes the decision invalid. He cited several

authorities on this point. But in the petition this point was not raised as a

reason to quash the impugned part of the circular. There was no decision

by any administrative authority, on the representations made by the

Petitioners, requesting to give retrospective effect to the said circular,

before instituting this action.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted two letters marked as CA

1 and CA 2 with the written submissions. These documents relate to the

facts. The opposing party was deprived of replying to these documents

because it was not tendered with the Petition.

The document marked CA 2 is a letter issued by the Director

General of Establishments in response to the representations made by the

Petitioners requesting to backdate the effective date of the circular P 13.

The request has been refused and a reason given in that letter. The reason

4

is that the National Salary and Carder Commission have observed that it

is not necessary to amend the policy decision of the Treasury on the

arrears of salary. The Petitioners have not made the National Salary and

Carder Commission or its members a party to this application and they

were denied the opportunity of explaining as to why they came to that

observation.

The Petitioners, from the very beginning knew that the National

Salary and Carder Commission is in authority in salary restructuring of

the public servants. The Petitioners made several representations to the

commission on salary anomaly. The letter PIO (a) is address to the Salary

and Carder committee. The letter PIO (e) is a document produced by the

Petitioners. It says that the anomaly was referred to the Salary and

Carder committee for recommendations. The letter PIO (i) is a letter

addressed to the Salary Commission by the Petitioners' association. PII

(b) also says that the issue was referred to the Salary Commission for

their attention. Pl2 (a) is a letter send to the Salary and Carder

Commission through their Attorney at Law. All these correspondence

establish that the Petitioners were aware of the fact that the Salary and

Carder Commission is the authority that recommends the salary revision.

If it is only the Respondents that are in authority, it is not necessary for

the Petitioners to make representations to the Salary and Carder

Commission and its predecessors, seeking redress. The Petitioners

knowingly and willingly avoided nammg the Salary and Carder

Commission as a party to this application. Under these circumstances, not

naming the National Salary and Carder Commission and its members as a

party is fatal.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners cited the cases of

Gnanasambathan v. Rear Admiral Perera and others [1998} 3 Sri L R

J 5

169 and P.Karunarathne v. Commissioner of Co-operative Development

and Another 79 ii NLR 193 and submitted that the necessary party in a

writ application is the person/authority whose exercise of power is sought

to be quashed. In the instant case it is the National Salary and Carder

Commission is the authority which decides and recommends the salary

structure of Government employees to the relevant departments.

Therefore it cannot be argued that the National Salary and Carder

Commission is not a necessary party.

There was a salary anomaly and it was rectified. The issue is

whether the Petitioners are entitled to the arrears of salary from the date

of restructuring the MLTS to establish SLTS i.e. 01.07.1994. The

circular P13 restricted it to 01.09.2008. The Respondents say that it is a

policy decision of the Government. The Petitioners argument is that even

a policy decision is amenable to judicial review. If there is a fundamental

right violation, it may be subject to judicial review as observed by Justice

Mark Fernando in case of Mundy v. Central Environmental Authority SC

Appeal 5812003 s.c. Minutes 20.01.2014 referring to the case of Perera

v. Edirisinghe [1995J 1 Sri L R 148, 156. This being a writ application,

unless the necessary parties are before Court, any administrative decision

cannot be reviewed.

Under these circumstances, I dismiss this application.

I order no costs.
