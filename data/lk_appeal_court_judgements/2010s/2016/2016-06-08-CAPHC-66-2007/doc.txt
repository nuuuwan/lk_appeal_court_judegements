Written submissions

filed on 10.08.2015 and 14.08.2015.

Decided on 16.022016

Malinie Gunaratne, J.

Appellant has filed this case seeking the intervention of this Court to

revise and set aside the Orders of the learned High Court Judge dated

20.03.2007 and the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 16.08.2005,

stating that the Orders of both Courts are against the legal norms and stating

that the orders delivered by both Courts are against the law and justice.

Before this Court proceeds to examine the merits of the case, it is

pertinent to note that the Petition of Appeal of the Appellant is perse

defective.

Firstly, it is relevant to consider whether this Appellant has filed this

Petition of Appeal in accordance with Rule 2(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal

Rules.

3

The Rule 2(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from

High Courts established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules of 1998

which, specifically states that an Appeal against any judgment or final order

or sentence of the Provincial High Court shall be addressed to the Court of

Appeal.

The said Rule 2 (1) (a) reads as follows:-

2 (1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment or final

order or sentence pronounced by the High Court in the exercise of the

Appellate or Revisionary Jurisdiction vested in by Article 154 P

(3)(b) of the Constitution, may prefer an appeal to the Court of

Appeal against such judgment for any error in law or fact.

(a) By lodging within fourteen days from the time of such judgment or

order being passed or made with such High Court, a Petition of

Appeal addressed to the Court of Appeal or .....

It is relevant to note that the purported Petition of Appeal dated

04.04.2007 is not addressed to the Court of Appeal and is instead addressed

to the Provincial Appellate High Court of Kalutara as follows:

"

"

The Rule 14 (1) of the Court of Appeal reads as follows:

14 (1) The Petition of Appeal shall be distinctly written upon good

and suitable paper, and shall contain the following particulars:-

4

(a) the name of the Court in which the application is pending

(does not contain the name of the Court of Appeal, instead

contains the Provincial Appellate High Court of Kalutara which

does not exist);

(b) the names of the parties to the application;

(c) the names of the Appellant and of the Respondent; (does not

contain in the Petition)

(d) the address to the Court of Appeal;

( e) a Plain and concise statement of the grounds of objection to the

order appealed against such statement to be set forth in duly

numbered paragraphs;

(t) a demand of the form of relief claimed.

It is relevant to note that the Appellant has not complied with Rule 14

(1) (a) and (c) of the Court of Appeal Rules.

It is significant to note, in the Appeal, there is no application to

consider the orders made by the learned High Court Judge and learned

Magistrate, in order to exercise the appellate jurisdiction. In the recital of

the Petition of Appeal only it IS mentioned as follows:

The view of the Court is, since the Appellant has not invoked the

appellate jurisdiction in this Court, Appellant is not entitled to proceed with

this case.

5

Hence, I am of the view that there is no proper Petition of Appeal

since the Appellant has not properly invoked the jurisdiction of this Court

and this Appeal should have been dismissed in limine.

It has been held over and over again by this Court as well as the

Supreme Court, non compliance with the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules are fatal to the application. The importance and the

mandatory nature of the observance of the Rules of the Court of Appeal in

presenting an application has been repeatedly emphasised and discussed in a

long line of decided authorities by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme

Court.

The Petition of Appeal filed by the Appellant in this case has not been

directed to the proper forum under the proper provision of law in as much as

no proper legally tenable appeal is pending.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above I dismiss this Appeal. Since

this Court has dismissed the Appeal, the Court is of the view that it is not

necessary to go into the merits of the Appeal.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

P.R. Walgama, J.

I agree

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Appeal is dismissed
