The Petitioner Company instituted this application seeking for a

mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari and a writ of prohibition. The

i

facts briefly are as follows. The Petitioner imported computer software

from India which was recorded in several Compact Disks. The petitioner,

at the Customs, declared the value of the transaction as Indian Rs. 990/-

which is the cost of the carrier media, the CDs. After a post audit inquiry,

Custom officials found that the royalty or the licenses fee is involved and

the real transaction value of the software is Euro 322,958. Thereafter the

custom held an inquiry and ordered the Petitioner to pay a sum of Rupees

Two Million as mitigated forfeiture of the goods. Being aggrieved by the

said decision, the Petitioner moved this Court to quash the decision by

way of a writ of certiorari and to issue a writ of prohibition to prevent the

customs from proceeding to implement the said decision.

The State objected to this application on several grounds. One of

the objections raised by the state is that there is an alternative remedy

provided by the statute itself and the Petitioner has already exercised that

right by instituting an action in the District Court and therefore writ does

not lie. Section 154 of the Customs Ordinance provides for an action to

be instituted in the competent court of civil jurisdiction, the Petitioner has

already exercised this right by instituting an action in the District Court of

Colombo. I will consider this objection first.

The petitioner admitted in the petition that an action was instituted

in the District Court of Colombo under section 154 and marked and

produced a copy of the plaint with the petition. The petitioner is seeking

for a declaration from the District Court that the impugned order of the

custom to be declared unlawful and/or contrary to the provisions

contained in the Customs Ordinances. The petitioner is asking this Court

to issue a writ of certiorari to quash the said decision. The Petitioner is

seeking the same relief from both courts. The objection has to be

considered in this context.

The Petitioner submits that this Court is vested with the writ

jurisdiction under Article 140 of the Constitution and it is not ousted by

the Customs Ordinance. The respondent do not argue that the writ

jurisdiction of this Court is ousted by section 154, but since there is an

alternative remedy provided by the same statute, and that remedy is by

way of an action in a competent Court of Law, and the writ jurisdiction

being a discretionary remedy of Court, a writ does not lie.

In the case of Ishak V Laxman Perera, Director General Of

Customs and others [2003 J 3 Sri L R 18 this issue has been discussed in

detail and held that except in an exceptional circumstances, a writ does

not lie since there is an alternative remedy.

It is a case where some money has been send out of the country.

The facts are not the same as this case and it was held that the forfeiture

in that case was an automatic forfeiture by operation of law and there was

no determination in that case and therefore the forfeiture is not amenable

to writ jurisdiction. But in that case, the issue whether the section 154 of

the Customs Ordinance would exclude the invocation of the writ

jurisdiction has been considered. Her Ladyship Justice Shiranee

Thilakawardane went on to discuss the availability of a writ in a case

where there is an alternative remedy and held that;

Another matter that has been urged by the respondents in this case

is that as a specific remedy has been set out in Section 154 of the

Customs Ordinance that this would exclude the invocation of the

writ jurisdiction as an alternative remedy was available in law.

"Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the

applicant with a satisfactory remedy the Courts will usually insist

i

on an applicant exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial

review. In doing so the Court is coming to a discretionary

decision. ". "Where there is a choice of another separate process

outside the Courts, a true question for the exercise of discretion

exists. For the Court to require the alternative procedure to be

exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review is in accord with

judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy of last

resort. It is important that the process should not be clogged with

unnecessary cases, which are perfectly capable of being dealt with

in another tribunal. It can also be the situation that Parliament, by

establishing an alternative procedure, indicated either expressly or

by implication that it intends that procedure to be used, in

exercising its discretion the Court will attach importance to the

indication of Parliament's intention".

Applying the provisions of Section 154 of the Customs Ordinance it

is clear that there is an existent remedy provided in terms of the

aforesaid section in the District Court of competent civil

jurisdiction. This was followed in several cases: (Fernando v

DharmasinW) (Gunasekera v Weerakoon (5) (Rodrigo v The

Municipal Council, Galle (6) and (Samarakoon v Tikiribanda (7)).

In other words where there was an alternative remedy that was

adequate for the adjudication of the matter that was being

challenged by the aggrieved party except under exceptional

circumstances this Court would not invoke the writ jurisdiction of

the Court. This is all the more important in this case in the

circumstances that the petitioner himself has claimed that he has

already invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court of Colombo

in case No. 271321MR and that such is on the identical facts that

5

has been canvassed before that Court of competent civil

jurisdiction.

In this context, the President's Counsel appearing for the petitioner

has cited the case of Somasunderam Vanniasingham v Forbes and

Another and suggested that it represents a new approach to the

rule relating to alternative remedies in exercising writ jurisdiction.

The respondents submit that this case has no application to the

point urged by them. In that case the Court held that there is no

rule requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The point

urged by these respondents is that there is an alternative statutory

remedy for the petitioner before a Court of law and not the

availability of any administrative remedy. In these circumstances

this Court finds that as there is an alternative, adequate remedy

provided in Section 154 of the Customs Ordinance, and as the

petitioner himself has already instituted action admittedly in the

competent Court of civil jurisdiction, the Court would not exercise

its discretion in favour of the issue of its writ jurisdiction, ..... .

The writ jurisdiction has not been excluded completely when there

is an alternative remedy but unless there are exceptional circumstances, it

was excluded. In the present case there are no exceptional circumstances.

The Petitioner declared the value of the of the carrier media of the

software as the transaction value of the imported goods, where the custom

officials found that a royalty or a licenses fee is involved in the

transaction and the true value of transaction is Euro 332,958. (I do not

propose to discuss the merits because the matter is pending before the

District Court for adjudication.) There are no exceptional circumstances

for the Petitioner to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this court.

In these circumstances this Court finds that as there is an

alternative, adequate remedy provided in Section 154 of the Customs

Ordinance, and as the petitioner himself has already instituted action

admittedly in the competent court of civil jurisdiction, the Court would

not exercise its discretion in favour of the issue of its writ jurisdiction, in

all the circumstances of this case, this application is dismissed. No costs.
