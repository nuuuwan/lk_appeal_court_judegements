Pw1 was inside a telephone booth behind the three wheeler park trying to take a call. The deceased came near him and started joking by putting his hand inside Pw1's trouser pocket trying to take some money. Then the Appellant is alleged to have come from behind and shot him with a pistol. At first Pw1 did not take any notice and thought he was joking when the deceased fell down. Thereafter the Pw1 realized that the deceased was shot by a real pistol as there was blood on the deceased's body.",

He had heard the sound of gun shots and had seen the deceased fallen. He had seen Pwl at the scene of crime where the deceased had fallen. After the shooting incident the Appellant had run away from the scene towards the market from the left side of his trishaw. However when Pw2 was cross examined he admitted that when the Appellant came to the three wheeler park he had nothing in his hand (Vide pg. 63, 64, 65). Therefore the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant argued that if the Appellant had a revolver in his hand, he would have seen it, and if he carried a bag he could have concealed the revolver in that, but according to the witness he was not carrying a bag. Therefore this causes a great doubt in the Prosecution case. Thus, he argued that the Appellant is not the person who brought a revolver and shot Samantha.",

Therefore it causes a great doubt in the Prosecution case (Vide Pg.37). Thus, the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant argued that Pw1's evidence is not credible. However, the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant has only been able to mark only one contradiction about the time difference of half an hour and it cannot be considered as a vital contradiction, because Pwl has stated that he cannot remember. It is stated in Wickremasuriya V Dodalina by Hon. Justice FND Jayasuriya in Case No CA 172/84. It was held that \"if the contradiction is not of that character the court ought to accept the evidence of witnesses whose evidence is otherwise cogent having regard to the test of probability and having regard to his demeanor and department manifest by witnesses. Trivial contradictions which do not touch the core of a party's case should not be given much significance.\"",

However the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant argued that it is highly improbable, because deceased was turning his back to the Appellant. Therefore it creates a reasonable doubt, since it is not possible for the Appellant to shoot the deceased from the front. The Pw15, Dr. D.L. Widyaratne JMO who held the post mortem of the deceased had observed 8 external injuries. Injury No.1 was an entry wound by a bullet and No 2 was an exit wound. Furthermore he discovered 4 bullets had entered the body of the deceased. The cause of death was due to gunshot injuries caused to the head and the chest of the deceased. The Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant argued that the entry wounds were in front of the body. This creates a reasonable doubt as it is not possible for the Appellant to shoot the deceased from the front, since he was turning his back to the Accused and was standing in front of Pw1. One cannot say at what point the first entry had taken place. The injured will never stay like a statue when receiving injuries. Certainly he would have been moving. Therefore there cannot be a hard and fast rule to come to a conclusion about entry wounds. The only conclusion which can be drawn is that the deceased had received injuries by the weapon used by the Appellant which is seen by witness no.1. Therefore medical evidence amply demonstrates the version of Pwl.",
