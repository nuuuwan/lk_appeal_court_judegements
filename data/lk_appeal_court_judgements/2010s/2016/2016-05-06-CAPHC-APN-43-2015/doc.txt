This is a revision application filed by the Honorable Attorney General

canvassing an order of the Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala.

i 1 I

The AG indicted the accused for committing offences punishable under

sections 140, 146 read with 296, 146 read with 409, 32 read with 296 and 32

read with 409 of the Penal Code. At the trial the prosecution moved to call the

witness No.1, Dilip Kumara Thisera who has given a statement to the police

and was listed as a witness in the non summary inquiry but was not called to

testify in the said non summary inquiry due to the unavailability. The defence

objected to the calling of this witness at the trial on the basis that the said

witness was not called as a witness in the non summary inquiry in the

Magistrate Court. The Learned High Court Judge, after considering the

submissions of both parties, determined that the Court is bound by the judgment

of the Court of Appeal in Republic of Sri Lanka v. Lokuhettige Suranimala C.A.

104-105/93, dated 26.10.94 and disallowed the witness. Being aggrieved by the

said order, the AG presented this revision application.

After supporting the application, notices issued on the accused but none

of the accused appeared in court or represented. The case was taken up for

argument without the accused-respondents.

The only issue in this case is whether the trial judge can call a person as a

witness who was not called as a witness in the non summary inquiry. The

purpose of holding the non summary inquiry is to ascertain whether there is a

prima facie case against the accused to commit him for trial in a higher Court.

The Magistrate is not required or empowered to decide whether the accused is

guilty or not guilty at the non summary inquiry. His task is only to find out

whether there is enough evidence to commit the accused for trial.

SARAMv. WEERA. 1 NLR 95

In proceedings taken under chapter XVI. of the Criminal Procedure

Code, a Police Magistrate has to take and record evidence for the

prosecution with the view of ascertaining whether there is such a prima

facie case made out against the accused as could justifY him in

!

II(ff

committing the accused for trial to a Superior Court, and not to

determine his guilt or innocence which is in issue only in trials under

chapter XIX

The Magistrate can commit the accused for trial if he is satisfied that

there is a prima facie case against him, even without calling all the witnesses to

testify before Court. As I pointed out earlier, the Magistrate is not going to

decide the guilt or innocence of the accused, it is the High Court that is doing

so. Therefore, even if the witness was not produced before the Magistrate, the

trial judge (the High Court Judge) must have the benefit of hearing all the

evidence.

Section 148 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code specifies the way of

recording evidence in the non summary inquiry. It says thus;

(1) The Magistrate shall then take, in the presence of the accused and in

the manner hereinafter provided, the statements on oath or affirmation of

those who know the facts and circumstances of the case, and put them in

writing (called the depositions):

Provided that the Magistrate shall not, except where the Attorney-

General otherwise directs, summon and record the evidence of any expert

witness but shall only cause such witness's report to be produced and

filed of record.

In the present case the learned Magistrate has recorded the depositions of

the witnesses who were available at the non summary inquiry. The witness in

question was not available.

Section 162 of the Code provides that the names of the witnesses whom

the prosecution intends to call as witnesses to be entered in the indictment. The

section reads;

I

f ! I

162. (1) Every indictment for trial in the High Court whether with or

without a jury shall contain a list of witnesses whom the prosecution

intends to call and another list of documents and things intended to be

produced at the trial which documents and things shall be called

''productions ".

But anything in this subsection shall not be deemed or construed to

debar the prosecution after notice to the accused, from calling any

witness or producing any document or thing not specified in the

indictment.

In the present case the witness's name is listed in the list of witnesses and

the accused had notice of it. The statement made to the police by the witness is

available to the defence for questioning the witness.

Section 439 of the Code gives the authority to the trial judge to summon

any person as a witness. What is necessary is to summon such a person is that it

is essential to call that witness to arrive at a "just decision". The section reads;

439. Any court may at any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceeding

under this Code summon any person as a witness or examine any person

in attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall and re-

examine any person already examined; and the court shall summon and

examine or recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence

appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.

In the present case the witness in question was not called to gIve

evidence at the non summary inquiry because of his non availability. The record

shows that a warrant of arrest had been issued but was unable to secure his

presence in the Magistrate Court. In the case of The King v. Aron Appuhamy 51

NLR 358 a witness who was not called in the non summary inquiry, and who

was not listed in the list of witnesses, due to the unavailability, was allowed to

be listed and called.

The King V. Aron Appuhamy et al. 51 NLR 358 [Assize Court]

The Magistrate committed the accused for trial without examining a

material witness whose whereabouts could not be traced After the

indictment was signed, but before the trial, the missing witness was

discovered The Attorney-General gave notice both to the accused and

their legal advisers that he intended to move the Court of trial to amend

the indictment by adding the name of the new witness. The defence was

also supplied with a precis of the evidence which the witness was

expected to give.

DIASJ

The question, therefore, which I must now decide is whether in allowing

this application, any substantial injustice or prejudice will be caused to

the accused No prejudice can possibly be caused to anybody by allowing

the truth to be made manifest. Therefore, if there is a witness who should

have been called in the Magistrate's Court but who, owing to his absence,

could not be so examined, it cannot cause injustice to the accused,

provided they have every opportunity of testing the evidence of the

witness by cross-examination on oath.

In the circumstances, therefore, although with some reluctance, I allow

the application. I trust that applications of this kind will be more the

exception than the rule.

In the present case, the witness in question is already listed in the list of

witnesses and it is not necessary to amend the indictment.

The facts in the case of Republic of Sri Lanka v. Lokuhettige Suranimala

C.A. 104-105/93, CA minute 26.10.94, are different from the present case. In

the above case witness in question was the only eye witness and the jury relied

solely on this witness's evidence. In the present case it is not so. The learned

Magistrate committed the accused for trial even without hearing the witness in

question; which means that there is sufficient evidence other than the evidence

of the witness in question.

Under these circumstances, I set aside the order of the Learned High

Court Judge dated 11.02.2015 and hold that there is no bar for the prosecution

to call Dilip Kumara Thisera as witness in this case.
