L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of A vissawella.

The Accused Respondent Respondent (hereinafter called and

referred as to the Respondent) was charged before the Magistrate Court

Kaduwala on a charge of causing grievous hurt punishable under section

,

2

3 16 of the Penal Code. After trial the learned Magistrate acquitted the

Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said acquittal, the Plaintiff Petitioner

Appellant (hereinafter called and referred as to the Appellant) sought

permission from the Hon. Attorney General to appeal against the order of

the Learned Magistrate, but was not granted. Thereafter, the Appellant

moved in revision in the High Court of A vissawella. The learned High

Court Judge after inquiry dismissed the application. This appeal is from

the said dismissal.

The Appellant and the Respondent had a dispute over a roadway

prior to this incident. There was an action filed under section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act. After the order was delivered, another case

on committing contempt of Court by violating the order was also filed

between the parties. But the present case is clearly on a criminal charge

against the Respondent. The Appellant in the petition of appeal prayed for

a relief in relation to the road dispute. Prayer 'D' of the petition of appeal

is for an order to use the road without any obstruction. In a criminal case

where the Respondent was charged under section 316, Court cannot grant

any relief on a road dispute.

The Petitioner as the injured person gave evidence in the

Magistrate Court. He said that when he was returning after inspecting

three coconut trees that was to be cut, he was assaulted by the Respondent

with an iron rod. There were several contradictions in his evidence and in

the first complaint. There were material contradictions in his and the

second witness's evidence too. In the evidence he said that he was

assaulted on his neck and the shoulder. He was very specifically said that

the Respondent did not say any filthy words during the incident.

According to the Appellant, the only word used by the Respondent is that

he inquired who is going in the road. But in the police complaint he has

3

stated that the Respondent asked '2::5)0<; ~@2::5)j @@csJ ................ " In cross

examination he denied that he said to the police that the Respondent used

the word ~@2::5)j. The second witness in her evidence said that the

Respondent abused the Appellant in filth language and assaulted. The

Respondent in his evidence said that he was assaulted on the neck and the

shoulder but the second witness said assaulted on the head. The

contradiction marked v2 is that he said to the police that he was assaulted

on the back of his head but he denied that he said so to police. The

contradiction marked v3 is a very material contradiction. The witness

denied that he said "@@ ul@825) @2::5)J8 @8 i5)U OJo2:3'f cs.nms125) IDl~UJ. 658

@@ @OJO @<;J CDl~UJ." In his evidence there was nothing about straggling.

In the history given to the Doctor by the Appellant, he has informed that

he was hit with an iron pipe. One can argue that the appearance of the

pipe and the rod is alike; the Appellant was very specific in his evidence

that he was hit with a rod. Answering to Court, he went on to describe the

rod saying that it is like "CDC CY2s125)" but with a flat end and not with a

pointed end. If he has identified the weapon so perfectly, there was no

reason to say that it was a pipe to the Doctor.

The learned Magistrate acquitted the Respondent on the basis that

the prosecution has failed to prove the charge.

The Appellant, being unsuccessful in obtaining the sanction of the

Attorney General to appeal, moved in revision in the High Court of

Avissawella against the acquittal. The learned High Court Judge

dismissed the revision application. This appeal is from the said order of

the learned High Court Judge.

The purpose of revision of this nature is to prevent the miscarriage

of justice. M. Sevanthinathan V. Nagalingam and 3 others 69 NLR 419 is

" 4

a case where the complainant moved in revision against an acquittal. In

the said case T. S. Fernando, J. observed that;

The complainant-petitioner instituted a private prosecution in the

Magistrate's Court against the accused-respondents alleging that

they had committed offences punishable under sections 290 and

292 of the Penal Code. The charges as framed in the Magistrate's

Court alleged (1) that the accused defiled the Saivite temple at

Chankanai East with the knowledge that all the Vellala and other

high caste Saivites are likely to consider such defilement as an

insult to the Saiva religion and (2) that the accused committed

trespass in the said Saivite temple by entering the flagstaff

mandapam therein with the knowledge that the feelings of the

Vellala and other high caste Saivites are likely to be wounded,

offences punishable under the said sections 290 and 292

respectively.

After a lengthy trial in the course of which a scholar said to be an

expert in the exposition of the Agamas or the gospel was called for

the prosecution, the learned Magistrate acquitted all the accused.

An appeal from this acquittal was not competent except with

sanction obtained from the Attorney-General. Such sanction was

sought unsuccessfully by the petitioner who thereupon presented

this application in revision to this Court claiming a retrial before

another Magistrate. It is now settled that before this Court can

grant a prayer like that of the petitioner on this application in

revision, the petitioner must make out a case showing something in

the nature of a positive miscarriage of justice in the Magistrate's

Court. - The King v. Noordeen.1 [(1910) 13 N. L. R. at page 118.]

In the present case the learned Magistrate acquitted the Respondent

(the accused in the case before him) on the failure of the prosecution to

prove the charge. As I have pointed out earlier in this judgment there

were lot of contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution. The virtual

complainant's evidence is contradicted with his previous statements given

to the police and the history given to the doctor, and it is contradicted

with the evidence of the second witness. The credibility of the witness is

in doubt. Therefore I do not see any other decision that the learned

Magistrate could have arrived at other than acquitting the Respondent.

The learned High Court Judge correctly dismissed the revision

application.

I do not see any reason to interfere with the finding of the learned

High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
