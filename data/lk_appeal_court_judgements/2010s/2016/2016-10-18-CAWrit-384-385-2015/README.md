JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned counsel for

both parties agreed that one judgment from this court would suffice for

both the above applicatio.ns as it is the same issue that is canvassed.in

both cases. Hence this judgment will apply to C A (writ) Application No.

384/ 2015 as well as to No. 385/ 2015.

1 st and 2nd Petitioners are unsuccessful applicants who have sought

admission of 2nd and 4th Petitioners as students to grade 1 of Rahula

College, Matara.

Complaint made to this Court by the Petitioners is that the respondent

school authorities unlawfully deducted 05 marks on the basis that S.

Thomas' Boys School exists in between Matara Rahula College and the

residence of the Petitioners.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on, the map marked and

produced as P 6 while the Respondents relied on the map marked and

produced by them as R 1.

It is the argument of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that this court

should not act on the map (R 1) produced by the respondents because it

is not admissible under section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance is as follows,

"the Court shall presume that maps, plans, surveys purporting to be signed

by the Surveyer General or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by

his authority and are accurate; but maps, plans, or surveys not so signed

must be proved to be accurate."

It has to borne in mind that this court at this instance is dealing with an

application for prerogative writs and is not engaged in a trial in which

ascertaining accurate distances has become necessary. The task before

this court in this case is only to verify whether respondent school

authorities have acted within their powers. In the light of this background

7

it must be borne in mind, as revealed before this Court that it is the same

method that the respondent school authorities have adopted to measure

the distances in respect of all applicants to be enrolled as students.

Distance from the Petitioner's residence to the particular school according

to the map P 6 is 864.5 Metres which he argues is legally admissible,

correct measurement.

However, it is the position of the Respondents that the distance from the

Petitioner's residence to the particular school is 1100 Metres according to R

1. It is the position of the Petitioners that the measured distance referred

to in the map P 6 is a distance measured from the Petitioners' residence to

the main gate of the school. However, it is the Respondent's pOSition that

the distance they measured is from the Petitioner's residence to the

Principal's office of the school. It was the submission of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that the school authorities considered the Principal's office

as the point from which the distance to the residences of all the applicants

were measured.

Learned DSG drew the attention of this court to paragraph 19 of the

counter objections filed by the Petitioners. The Petitioners have admitted in

that paragraph that they measured the distance from the main gate of the

school and not the Principal's office.

It is to be noted that new maps such as maps marked and produced as P

6 and P 9 by the Petitioners cannot be taken into consideration in the

appeal proceedings as per rules that are applicable in respect of admission

of children to the government schools.

In the case of Mohommed Uzman Nazif Vs Upali Gunasekara, Principal

Royal College and 2 others eSC FR 30/2012) decided on 2012-08-30, cited

by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the Supreme Court has stated that

additional documents filed, should not be considered since the selection of

students were made on the basis of documents furnished at the interview,

the correction of which were verified by sight inspections1

The Petitioners did not seek to challenge the fact that school authorities

measured the distance to the residences of the applicants from the

Principal's office. Learned counsel for the Petitioners conceded that the

success of his case would solely depend on approximately 12 Kilometres

which is the difference of figures 876.31 Metres and 864.51 Metres

referred to in his map P 6.

In any case Petitioners have not been able to satisfy this court that there is

a discrepancy in the figures relied upon by the Respondents, regarding the

distance from the Petitioner's residence to the Principal's office of the

school. In other words, Petitioners have not established that the distance

from the main gate of the school to the Principal's office is less than 12

metres.

In these circumstances Petitioner's case should fail.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Respondents also

submitted that there are 17 other students above the Petitioners in the list

prepared by the school for admission of students and hence even if the

1 at page 7 of the judgment

9

, Petitioner's argument succeed it will not be possible for the school

authorities to admit the Petitioners, above those 17 students.

In these circumstances we hold that there is no merit in this application.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis as to

why the writs applied for by the Petitioner should be issued. Hence we

decide to dismiss both these applications namely C A (writ) Applications

No. 384/ 2015 and No. 385/ 2015. No cost is ordered.

Application is dismissed.
