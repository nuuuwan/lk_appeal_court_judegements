L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is a revision application from the High Court of Jaffna. The

Appellant has constructed an electrical power house for power

generation. Before commencing power generation, people of the aria had

made several complaints to the police on environmental pollution,

specially the water pollution. The police referred the matter to the

Magistrate Court of Mallakam where it has been ordered to suspend the

operation of the power house. Being aggrieved by the order of the

Learned Magistrate, the matter has been taken to the High Court on

revision. The present revision application is against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge.

The learned President's Counsel for the Appellant commenced the

argument and submitted that the Appellant was cleared by all the

institutions who had conducted scientific investigations. He drew the

attention of Court on the reports submitted by the said institutions. His

contention is that there is no environmental pollution by the Appellant.

At the end of his submissions, the learned President's Counsel for

the Respondent Mr. K. Kanag-Iswaran asked the learned President's

Counsel for the Appellant Mr. Nihal Fernando whether he had finished

the submission for the Appellant and Mr. Nihal Fernando PC informed

that he has concluded the submissions for the Appellant. At this stage Mr.

K. Kanag-Iswaran PC raised a preliminary objection that the learned

President's Counsel for the Appellant has not referred to any errors or

mistakes committed by the Learned High Court Judge and moved to

dismiss this appeal.

The practice of presenting the appellant's case before the Court is

to read the judgment of the lower Court and to point out the errors and

"

mistakes in the order on facts and on law. No doubt that it is a worthy

practice to follow, but can this Court dismiss an appeal for not following

the said practice? My view is that it cannot.

Under section 769(2) of the Civil Procedure Code an appeal cannot

be dismissed on the non appearance of the appellant. Under this section,

if the appellant does not appear either in person or by an attorney at law

to support his appeal, the court shall consider the appeal and make such

order thereon as it think fit. The intention of the Legislature is that once

an appeal is preferred, the Court shall not dismiss the appeal without

considering, even if it is not supported. The Court was burdened with the

task of considering the merits of the appeal. Under these circumstances, I

believe that the Court cannot dismiss an appeal merely because of not

pointing out the errors and mistakes of the lower court judge in the

submissions of the Counsel of the Appellant.

I overrule the preliminary objection.
