Order

Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application Rev. Doctor Cleatus Chandrasiri Perera had come before this

court seeking inter alia,

b) To grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to hold the classes

KG/ Ambepussa Maha Vidyalaya (Grade 4-6) at KG/ Roman Catholic Mixed

School and, the decision of the 1st ,2nd and the 3rd Respondents refusing to divest

the said school.

c) To grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st ,2nd and the 3rd

Respondents to make order, divesting the belonging to the Petitioner vested in the

state where the KG/ Ambepussa Roman Catholic Sinhala Mixed School at

Mahena, Warakapola was conducted, which property is more fully described in

the schedule hereto.

It was the position of the Petitioner before this court that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Galle,

the predecessor of the Petitioner was the proprietor of KG/ Ambepussa Roman Catholic Sinhala

Mixed School at Warakapola prior to the said property vested in the Government under the

Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act No.5 of 1960 and No.8

of 1961.

Petitioner has alleged that the said school which was vested with the Government was not used

for the purpose to which it was vested, i.e. to use it as KG/ Ambepussa Roman Catholic Mixed

School or to use it under the changed name KG/ Ambepussa Sarasawi Prathamika Vidyalaya and

therefore the Petitioner being the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ratnapura, created as a new diocese

in place of Roman Catholic Bishop Galle is entitled under section 10 of the Act No 8 of 1961 for

the divesting of the said school property. It is the position of the Petitioner before this court that

the Petitioner received a positive response from the Education Authorities when the request was

made for the divesting of the said property with the Catholic Church, but later it was revealed

that the Education Authorities of the area has decided to operate few classes of KG/ Ambepussa

Maha Vidyalaya in the said premises and the Petitioner has decided to come before this court

against the said decision.

When the said matter was supported before this court on 10th May 2013, court issued notices on

the Respondents. The Respondents who came before this court had challenged the position taken

up by the Petitioner and submitted during their objections that there was no decision to divest the

said property and it is being used now, for the same purpose it was vested in 1961.

However when this matter was fixed for Argument after the pleadings were completed, a person

by the name Aberathnage Ajith Thushara of 483/3, Mahena, Warakapola had filed papers before

this court seeking intervention for the present case.

Since the Petitioner objected to the above intervention, this court decided to first consider the

said objections and decide on the application made by the Intervenient-Petitioner for

intervention.

According to the Intervenient -Petitioner, prior to the present application was filed in the Court

of Appeal, Rev. Noel Rovel of the Christ the King Church, Ambepussa filed a Writ Application

in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden in Kegalla against the Zonal Director of

Education -Kegalle seeking a Writ of Mandamus compelling the said Director to erecting a fence

along the boundaries of the school in question.

When the Intervenient-Petitioner his mother and his uncle become aware of the said application,

they moved to intervene in the said application, since the access road to their house runs through

the premises of the school concerned. However the Intervenient-Petitioner, settled the said

application with the Petitioner and the Respondent to the said application.

Intervenient-Petitioner has submitted several deeds with regard to the premises on which the KG!

Ambepussa Roman Catholic Sinhala Mixed School was said to have situated, and claims title to

the said land and further moved that, in case the said land is divested, it should be handed over

not to the Petitioner but to the Intervenient -Petitioner

In the said circumstances Intervenient-petitioner has submitted that he is a necessary party to the

present application and therefore moved that he be permitted to intervene to the present case.

The fact that Intervenient-Petitioner lived in one of the boundary to the school in question and

the Writ application which was pending in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden

in Kegalle was settled with the Intervenient-Petitioner cannot be considered in favour of the

Intervenient-Petitioner in considering the present request by him for intervention to the

application since the nature of the two applications were somewhat different.

As observed in this judgment the Petitioner has come before this court under the provisions of

Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Supplementary Provision) Act No.5 of 1960 and No.8

of 1961 claiming that the said premises is not used for the purpose to which it was vested.

As admitted by the Intervenient-Petitioner, it is the Petitioner's predecessor who was in

occupation and control of the KG! Ambepussa Roman Catholic Sinhala Mixed School at the time

the school was vested with the Government, even though Intervenient-Petitioner claims title to

the said property.

When filing objections before this court the Respondents have taken up the position that the said

property is being used now for the same purpose it was vested in 1961.

Under these circumstances the issuance of a Writ as prayed by the Petitioner or rejection of the

Writ is purely based on the material already furnished by the Petitioner and the Respondents.

As submitted by the Intervenient-Petitioner before this court, the mam purpose of his

intervention is to submit a claim to the premises in question but his claim will not in any event

assist this court to find the merits or demerits of the present case.

In the case of Illandari Devage Ranasinghe and Others V. Commissioner General of Excise

and Yen. Udawaththa Nanda Them and Others; CNWrit application 127/10 (CA minutes of

11.05.2011) the Court of Appeal followed the following criteria in considering intervention,

a. The Intervenient -Petitioners must have sufficient cause and interest and are affected

parties and that,

b. It would be the interest of Justice to permit intervention and that the intervention of

the Intervenient-Petitioner would assist court in the proper administration of justice

and adjudication of the matter before court

The same issue was considered in the case of L.U.P. ]ayawardena V. Minister of Health and

Others CA/Writ application No. 978.2008 (CA minutes of 21.05.2009) as follows,

"What the court at this point of time needs to consider is whether the intervenient party is

a necessary party and having such party in the case would in all circumstances assist

court in considering the merits and demerits of the application before this court"

As discussed by me earlier, the Intervenient-Petitioner's claim will not assist the court in

considering the merits or demerits of this case.

The Intervenient- Petitioner though admit that the land in question was occupied and in the

control of the Predecessor to the Petitioner, disputes the ownership of the said land and it is

observed by this court that as claimed by both parties, the ownership of the land in question is in

dispute and that has to be decided by a proper trial court but not by this court.

The Intervenient-Petitioner has failed to satisfy this court that he is a necessary party to the

present application before this court. Therefore I make order refusing the application by the

Intervenient-Petitioner for intervention in the present case.
