Counsel for the 54th Defendant-Appellant submits that the 54th defendant is entitled to

7 X perches from the land sought to be partitioned and that entitlement had been recognized

by the learned trial Judge by allocating 270/43200 shares to him. Accordingly, he moves to

withdraw the appeal filed by the 54th Defendant-Appellant. Counsel for the other parties have

no objection to this application. Having allowed the said application, Court makes an order to

dismiss the appeal of the 54th Defendant-Appellant without costs.

Learned Counsel for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Appellants submits that the learned

trial Judge having considered the evidence has correctly allocated the shares due to the 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Defendant-Appellants. Therefore, he submits that the three appellants in the appeal

bearing No.203/97 are not pursuing their appeal. Therefore, the appeal of the 1st to 3rd

Defendant-Appellants also stands dismissed without costs.

Counsel for all the parties at this stage submit that the issues raised in the remaining

appeal bearing No.202/97 filed by the 29th Defendant-Appellant also is settled in the following

manner.

All the parties concede that the rights derived from the Deed marked as 29V19 have

been accepted by the learned District Judge pursuant to the plaintiff filing a consolidated

pedigree with the consent of all the parties to the action. However, it is the submission of the

Counsel that the learned District Judge has failed to allocate shares correctly in terms of the

rights emanated from the said Deed marked 29V19 despite him accepting those rights referred

to therein. Having considered the rights in the Deed marked 29V19 and the allocation of shares

made by the learned District Judge, it is apparent that the learned District Judge has allocated

only 6535/43200 shares when his entitlement in terms of the said Deed 29V19 should have

been 4/9 shares amounting it to 16200/43200 shares.

However, as of a settlement, the 29th Defendant-Appellant at this stage agrees to

restrict his entitlement to 14450/43200 shares. Accordingly, all the parties at this stage agree

to allocate 14450/43200 shares to the 29th Defendant-Appellant and also agree to deduct the

additional shares that he is now been allocated, from the shares that had been left un-allotted

making it to become 1990/43200 shares.

In view of the above agreement arrived at by the parties, learned District Judge of

Horana is directed to amend the share of the 29th Defendant-Appellant to read as 14450/43200

and un-allotted shares to read as 1990/43200 and thereafter to enter interlocutory decree

accordingly.

Subject to the aforesaid variation of the allotment of shares, the appeal filed by the 29th

Defendant-Appellant is also dismissed without costs.

Appeals dismissed.
