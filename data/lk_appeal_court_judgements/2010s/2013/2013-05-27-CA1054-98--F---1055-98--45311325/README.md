: 20.05.2013.

Both Counsel made submissions in support of their respective

cases having agreed to take up all the 3 appeals together. The said 3

appeals bear the Nos.l054/98F, 1055/98F and 1056/98F. Counsel

also submitted that the evidence in relation to all three cases had

been recorded in the action bearing No. 7779 I M filed in the District

Court of Negombo. Accordingly, they moved that the evidence

recorded in that case be considered as the evidence relevant to all

three appeals.

1

These three appeals have come up before this Court pursuant

to the order dated 14.09. 1998 delivered by the learned District

Judge of Negombo. In that order, learned District Judge stated that

it relates to all three cases bearing Nos.7823/M, 7824/M and

7779/M.

Those 3 cases have been filed in order to recover damages

from the 1st and the 2nd defendants for causing death of Ratnayake

Liyanage Karunasena. Death was due to a collision of the vehicles

bearing No.38 - 5925 driven by the 1st defendant-respondent and

the motor cycle rode by the deceased, Karunasena. Three plaintiffs

are the wife and the two children of Karunasena. The claim against

the 2nd defendant-appellant was on the basis that he was the owner

of the said vehicle 38-5925 at the time.

Three cases were taken up ex parte by the trial judge and the

judgments were delivered in favour of the 3 plaintiffs accordingly.

Thereafter, applications to execute the decrees in respect of all the

cases had been made against the Sri Lanka Insurance Company in

terms of Section 105 of the Motor Traffic Act. The said insurance

company was the insurer of the vehicle driven by the 1st defendant

and it was made a party to the action as the 3rd defendant at a

subsequent stage. First application that was made to have the

2

decrees executed was refused by the learned District Judge by his

order dated 25.10.1996. The said order dated 25.10.1996 had been

canvassed in this Court and an order was made refusing the 3

appeals but allowing the learned District Judge to re-consider the

applications if another request is made. Accordingly, once again

separate applications had been made in all three cases to have the

decrees executed against the 3rd defendant-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) and the learned District Judge then

made order allowing the said applications of the plaintiffs. Being

aggrieved by this order, the appellant had filed this appeal.

Learned President's Counsel for the appellant, at the outset

submitted that the issue in this matter is to determine whether a

notice was sent to the insurer as required by Section 105 of the

Motor Traffic Act in order to have the insurer liable. Indeed, this

appeal is on the basis that it is wrong on the part of the learned

District Judge to decide that a notice in terms of Section 105 of the

Motor Traffic Act had been given to the insurer. Therefore, I will now

consider whether it is correct or not to decide that the notice

referred to in the said Section 105 had been given to the insurer in

this instance.

3

The said Section 105 of the Motor Traffic Act stipulates:

1 05. ( 1) If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under section 1 00 (4) to the persons by whom a policy has been effected, a decree in respect of any such liability as is required by section 100 (1) (b) to be covered by a policy of insurance (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) is obtained against any person insured by the policy, then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel, or may have avoided or cancelled, the policy, the insurer shall, subject to the provisions of sections 1 06 to 1 09, pay to the persons entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum payable thereunder in respect of that liability, including any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum under such decree.

The Section that follows Section 105 is the Section 106 of the

Motor Traffic Act which prohibits payment by the insurer under a

decree of Court unless a notice under Section 1 05 is given to the

insurer. Therefore, it is mandatory to send a notice under Section

105 of the Motor Traffic Act in order to have a decree of a Court

executed.

Section 106 of the Motor traffic Act reads thus:

"1 06.No sum shall be payable by an insurer under the provisions of section 1 05 -

(a) in respect of any decree, unless before or within seven days after the commencement ofthe action in which the decree was entered, notice of the action had been given to the insurer by a party to the action;"

At this stage, it must be noted that the said Section 105 of the

Motor Traffic Act has now been amended requiring a plaintiff to

4

make the insurer a party to an action when a claim is made upon an

Insurance Policy.

Be that as it may, the contention of the learned Counsel for

the respondent in this instance is that the letter dated 15.02.1993

marked as P4 in evidence, is the notice that was given to the insurer

in accordance with Section 105 of the Motor Traffic Act. It is a letter

written by C.Vignarajah, Attorney-at-Law, writing on the

instructions of his clients supposed to have been the 3 plaintiffs.

The said letter was addressed to K.Ajith Mohamed Riyal namely, the

2nd defendant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent)

and not to the insurer, Sri Lanka Insurance Company. A copy of this

letter had also been sent to Filomina Ratnayake, who is one of the

plaintiffs.

Accordingly, on the face of the said letter marked P4, nothing

1s found to establish that it was sent to the Insurance Company.

Therefore, the letter per se does not establish sending a notice to the

insurer under Section 105 of the Motor Traffic Act.

Learned District Judge in coming to his conclusion seems to

have considered the contents of the said letter P4 and had held that

the insurer had accepted having received the letter P4. However, in

5

the contents of the letter P4 nothing is found to conclude that the

insurer had accepted that it had received the letter P4. In the

circumstances, it is incorrect to decide that the contents of the letter

Marked P4 constitutes sending of a notice under Section 105 of the

Motor Traffic Act.

Learned Counsel for the respondent then argued that the

learned District Judge was correct when he decided that there is

evidence to prove sending of a notice under Section 105. In doing so

he submitted that the 2nd defendant has stated that the letter

marked P4 was handed over to the Insurance Corporation by

himself. However, having perused the brief, the Counsel for the

respondent conceded that there is no such evidence available

though the learned District Judge has stated so. The Court upon a

careful consideration of the matter finds that there is evidence as to

a discussion had with the officials of the insurer but is unable to

find evidence as to handing over of such a letter to the Insurance

Corporation by the 2nd defendant.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant also submitted that

there is another letter which is dated 30.04.1993 found at page 172

in the brief in which it indicates that the Insurance Corporation was

aware of the action that is to be filed in this regard and therefore it

should be treated as the notice under Section 105. However,

contents of the said letter dated 30.04.1993 does not indicate

6

anything as to a filing of action. Furthermore, the said letter dated

30.04.1993 had not been produced in evidence at all. Therefore, the

Court could not have considered the contents of the said letter

without it being marked in evidence at the relevant inquiry.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent referring

to the statement of objection dated 09.02.1996 of the insurance

company (vide page 44 of the brief) submitted that the insurer was

aware of receiving a notice under Section 105 in this instance.

Therefore, he contended that the insurer is estopped from stating

that it did not receive such a notice.

In paragraph 3(qo) in the said objections referred to by the

learned Counsel and was filed by the insurance company, nothing is

found as to a notice under Section 105 but in that it is stated that a

letter demand dated 15.02.1993 had been sent. However, the said

letter of demand dated 15.02.1993 is not addressed to the

respondent Insurance Corporation. Moreover, unless those matters

found in a statement of objections were led in evidence, no trial

judge is in a position to consider such matters on his own at an

inquiry such as this.

For the reasons set out above, I am not inclined to accept the

submissions that there is evidence available to decide that there had

been notice to the insurance company under Section 105 of the

Motor Traffic Act in this instance. Accordingly, I am inclined to

accept the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the

appellant.

7

For the aforesaid reasons, it is my considered view that the

respondent insurer was not given notice in terms of Section 105 of

the Motor Traffic Act in this instance though the learned District

judge has held otherwise. Accordingly, I allow all 3 appeals of the

insurance company and set aside the order dated 14.09.1998 of the

learned District Judge. Respondent insurance company is entitled to

the costs of this appeal as well.

Appeals allowed.
