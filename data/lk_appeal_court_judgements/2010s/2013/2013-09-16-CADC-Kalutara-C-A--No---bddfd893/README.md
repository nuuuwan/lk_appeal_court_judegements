K. T. Chitrasiri, J.

Counsel for the 26A and 29th Defendant-Appellants submits that

16th, 18th and 23rd Defendant-Respondents have died. However he is not

aware of the date of the death of those Respondents. Mr. Dolawatte

who is appearing for 3A, 9th, 25th and 33rd Defendant-Respondents submits

37th , 42nd , 43rd Defendant-Respondents have passed away.

1

Even though there are two sets of Appellants, no substitution had been

effected in respect of those respondents who have died. When this matter was

mentioned on 11.11.2011, it is recorded that the 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent had

died. The docket does not indicate as to any substitution effected on his

behalf since the year 2011 though several dates have been gIven to effect

the substitution. As mentioned before, number of parties have died but

necessary substitution have been effected only in respect of few of those

deceased respondents.

When this matter was mentioned in the month of May, a long

date, amounting it to become nearly 4 months, had been given to file

substitution papers. Not a single document has been filed since then to

effect the substitution. Those circumstances show that the two appellants

do not prosecute this appeal diligently. It has resulted preventing the decree

being executed and thereby the persons who have adjudgment in their favour

were unable enjoying its results for the last 15 years. Considering the above

this Court makes an order abating the appeal.

Appeal is abated.
