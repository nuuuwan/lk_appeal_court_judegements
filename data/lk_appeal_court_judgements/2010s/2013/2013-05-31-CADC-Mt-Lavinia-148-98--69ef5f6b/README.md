15th May 2013 by the 14A,l6,17,18,20 & 21st Defendant-Respondents-Respondents.

Two appeals have been filed by the plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff)

and by the I

5\ 2nd and the 4th defendant-respondents challenging the judgment dated 30.12.1997 of

the learned District Judge of Mt.Lavinia. Both the appeals were taken up for hearing together and

the respective Counsel made their submissions in support of their cases. The relief prayed for in

the appeal of the plaintiff is to set aside the judgment dated 30.12.1997 holding that the corpus of

the action consists of both Lots A and B shown in the Preliminary Plan No.2003 marked "X".

However, in the submissions filed on behalf of the plaintiff, an application has been made to remit

the case for retrial. The relief prayed for in the appeal filed by the I

5\ 2nd and the 4th defendant-

appellants is also to set aside the judgment holding that the land sought to be partitioned consists of

both Lots A and B shown in the plan marked X and to remit the case back to the District Court for

re-trial. Therefore, it is seen that the desire of all the appellants is to have this matter sent back for

re-trial after setting aside the judgment dated 30.12.1997. Their position is that it is wrong to have

decided to exclude Lot B from the corpus.

This action was filed to partition the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint filed

by the plaintiff. Consequent upon filing the action, the land sought to be partitioned was surveyed

and Surveyor S.Wickremasinghe has submitted his Plan bearing No.2003 and it was marked in

3

evidence as "X". At the trial, out of the 4 issues, 3 of those had been raised to identify the land

sought to be partitioned while the issue No.2 was framed to establish the pedigree shown in the

plaint. No appeal has been lodged to challenge the findings as to the pedigree. Accordingly, the

issue before this Court is to determine whether the decision of the learned District Judge as to the

identity of the land sought to be partitioned is correct or not.

The plaintiff and the 1st, 2nd and the 4th defendant- appellants took up the position that

the land shown in the Preliminary Plan marked "X" should be the corpus whilst the 14A, 16 to 21st

defendant-respondents were of the view that the block of land marked "B" in the said plan should

be excluded since it is a different land called Hettige Watte. Plaintiff has described the land sought

to be partitioned as Dimiyange Watta. Indeed, this is the issue before the learned District Judge

and then he has decided to exclude Lot B from the corpus rejecting the application of the plaintiff

as well as the 15\ 2nd and 4th defendants.

Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the block of land marked "B" shown in the

Preliminary Plan is Hettige Watta or is it a part of the land called Dimiyange Watte. Learned

District Judge has decided that the said block of land marked "B" is Hettige Watte and not a part of

Dimiyange Watte as claimed by the plaintiff.

Learned District Judge has found that the land shown in the plan marked "X" and the

land referred to in the extracts obtained from the Land Registry are two different lands. However,

the plaintiff in his evidence has given an explanation to this difference but it had not been prop~~ly

evaluated by the learned District Judge. It must also be noted that when he came to the said

conclusion in respect of the western boundary of the land shown in plan "X", he has not compared

with that of the western boundary of the other deeds marked in evidence. When he compared the

eastern boundary of the plan X with that of the eastern boundary of the relevant deeds, the learned

District Judge has once again failed to consider the eastern boundary in the deeds other than the

4

deed marked P9 and the Land Registry extracts marked 14Vl. Hence, it is possible to think that

the learned District has purposely evaded considering the boundaries of the relevant deeds in

coming to his conclusions.

The name of the land described in the document 14V1 is Pallage Watta. In that deed

the eastern boundary ofPallage Watta is mentioned as Hettige Watta. Relying upon this particular

evidence he has come to the conclusion that the Lot B should be Hettige Watta. However, it must

be noted that he has referred only to P9 and 14V1 when he came to the said conclusion

disregarding all the other deeds produced in evidence. Also, when he considered the northern

boundary, he has looked at only the documents marked P9 and 14V2. In that consideration, he has

disregarded the deed marked P 1 0 without a valid reason being assigned.

It is also significant to note that the learned District Judge has not considered the fact that

there are no physical boundaries visible on the ground to separate the Lots "A" & "B" shown in the

plan marked X. Absence of physical boundaries on the land may lead to indicate that both the !,ots

"A" & "B" had been possessed as one and the same land. Therefore, I am of the view that the

learned District Judge has not evaluated the evidence properly when he decided that Lot B is

Hettigewatta and not a part of Dimiyangewatta.

More importantly, it is to be noted that the burden, to establish the facts within the

knowledge of a particular person, rests on that person, in the event he/she makes a claim relying

upon those facts within his/her knowledge. In this instance, the 14A, and 16 - 21st defenc<l-lt-

respondents have failed to produce in evidence, the plan bearing No.625 found at page 159 of the

brief even though the said plan had been prepared on their behalf to support the claim to exclude

Lot B shown in the plan X. Had they called the Surveyor who drew the said plan bearing No.625,

the position would have been clearer. Hence, it is seen that the learned District Judge has not

~f

5

addressed his mind to this aspect namely burden of proof of the facts within the knowledge of a

particular person and to the consequences thereof.

In the circumstances, it is my opinion that the learned District Judge has failed to consider

the evidence in the manner as required by a trial judge. Therefore, this Court does not wish to

allow his findings to stand as they are. Accordingly, I decide to set aside the judgment dated

30.12.1997 of the learned District Judge. However, it must be noted that the matters argued before

this Court are basically in relation to the facts of the case. No particular question of law has been

raised. Therefore, in the event this Court, at this stage, decides to write a judgment considering the

available evidence, it may lead to arrive at a wrong conclusion. Trial Judge being the best person

to consider those matters consisting of facts and circumstances, I make order to have a trial de

novo.

Having considered those circumstances and also upon considering the reliefs prayed for by

both sets of the appellants, I make order to have a trial de novo in this instance. Accordingly, this

case is remitted back to the District Court of Mt.Lavinia and the learned District Judge in that

Court is directed to hold trial de novo. He is also directed to hear and conclude this case

expeditiously.

Appeals are allowed subject to the above condition. Parties are to bear their own expenses in

this appeal.

Appeals allowed Case remitted back for re-trial.
