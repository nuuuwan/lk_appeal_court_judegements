This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Hambanthota dated

06.12.1999.

The Plaintiff instituted the above styled action seeking the eviction of the Defendants from the

land is dispute. The position of the Plaintiff was that his father Ruwan Pathiranage Siyadoris was

issued a permit (Pi) under the Land Development Ordinance (Ordinance) to the land in dispute

and that his father had nominated him as the successor. It was further claimed that upon the

death of his father on 12.09.1964 he became the lawful permit holder to the land in dispute. The

Plaintiff sought the eviction of the Defendants from the said land as they were in unlawful

possession.

The Defendants in reply claimed that the 1st Defendant was the eldest son of Siyadoris and that

after the death of Siyadoris, he and the Plaintiff amicably divided the land in dispute from 1980

with the Plaintiff cultivating two acres on the eastern side and the pt Defendant cultivating one

acre on the western side. It was further claimed that the Plaintiff failed to succeed within one

year of the death of Siyadoris. The pt Defendant counter claimed for a declaration that he is

entitled to possess one acre on the western side of the land in dispute.

The learned District Judge entered judgment as prayed for in the plaint and hence this appeal.

The learned counsel for the Appellants urged the following grounds in appeal:

(1) The Plaintiff could not have maintained the action as he had not prayed for a declaration

of title.

(2) The learned District Judge erred in disregarding permits marked 01 and 02 which shows

that two permits under the Ordinance had been issued to the Substituted Plaintiff (La lith

Kumara), the son of the original Plaintiff, and 1st and 2nd Defendants.

Failure to seek a Declaration 0/ Title

At the argument the learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the Plaintiff cannot

maintain this action as he has not prayed for a declaration of title. The learned counsel for the

Respondents submitted that this is not an objection taken up in the District Court and as such the

Appellant should not be allowed to raise it in appeal for the first time.

A pure question of law which is not mixed with questions of fact can be taken up for the first time in

appeal [Tha/aga/a v. Gangodawi/a Co-operative Stores Society Limited (48 N.L.R. 472), Jayawickrema

v. Silva (76 N.L.R. 427)]. I hold that the question raised is a pure question of law and should be

considered by Court.

The learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that this being a rei vindicatio action there must a

prayer for a declaration of title. This submission is misconceived in law as Gratiaen J. held in

Pathirana v. Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169 at 173):

itA decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way of additional relief

either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in truth an action in rem) or in a lessor's

action against his overholding tenant {which is an action in personam)."

Clearly it is not incumbent on a plaintiff to seek a declaration of title in a rei vindicatio action. It

will be sufficient if the plaint contains a prayer to evict the trespasser or unauthorized occupier

from the land in dispute provided that he pleads the title in the body of the plaint which entitles

him to maintain the action.

In this case, the plaintiff has pleaded that he is a permit holder under the Ordinance. In Palisena

v. Perera (56 N.L.R. 407) it was held that a permit-holder under the Land Development Ordinance

enjoys a sufficient title to enable him to maintain a vindicatory action against a trespasser.

Indeed, if the Plaintiff had sought a declaration of title to the land in dispute, I would have held

he is not entitled to do so for the reasons morefully set out earlier in Jayatissa v. Bandara [CA.

891/97; C.A.M. 29.06.2018] where I held that a permit holder under the Ordinance is not entitled

to obtain a declaration that he is the owner of the land given to him in terms of a permit issued

under the Ordinance.

Before leaving this issue and in view of the many instances where the issue has come up before

this Court, I wish to state that a permit holder under the Ordinance has the following remedies

in order to evict a trespasser or unauthorized occupier from the state land given under the

permit:

(1) An action for a declaration that he is a permit holder under the Ordinance and eviction of

the trespasser or unauthorized occupier on the strength of such declaration [Attanayake

v. A/adin (1997) 3 SrLL.R. 386].

(2) An action where the only relief is to evict the trespasser or unauthorized occupier from

the land in dispute on the strength of his title pleaded in the body of the plaint [Palisena

v. Perera (56 N.L.R. 407), per Gratiaen J. in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169 at 173)].

(3) A possessory action in terms of section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance [Edirisuriya v.

Edirisuriya (78 N.L.R. 388)].

(4) An action for a declaration that he is the owner within the meaning ofthe Ordinance and

for eviction of the trespasser or unauthorized occupier on the strength of that declaration

[Amendment to section 2 of the Ordinance made by section 2 of Act No. 27 of 1981].

Permits marked D1 and D2

The case of the Plaintiff was based upon the permit marked P1. One T.N. Pushpa Kumari, Field

Advisor, Divisional Secretariat, Ambalanthota testified on 17.01. 1994 [Appeal Brief pages 90-96)

and stated that the permit P1 was originally granted in the name of Siyadoris who had nominated

the Plaintiff as his successor and that it was duly done [Appeal Brief pages 90-1). This evidence

establishes that as atthe date of the institution ofthe action the Plaintiff had a valid permit issued

under the Ordinance to the land in dispute.

Although the Defendants raised an issue on whether the Plaintiff had failed to succeed to the

land within one year of the death of Siyadoris they have failed to prove it and in any event the

evidence shows that the Plaintiff did in fact succeed as required by the law. Furthermore, issue

nos. 15 and 16 raised by the Defendants on 23.02.1999 after leading evidence of T.N. Pushpa

Kumari, Field Advisor, Divisional Secretariat, Ambalanthota cuts across this position as it is

claimed that D1 and D2 was issued after Lalith Kumara, son of the Plaintiff and now Substituted

Plaintiff-Respondent surrendered his rights to the Divisional Secretary [Proceedings of

23.02.1999, page 3).

There is a general principle that the rights of the parties must be determined as at the date of

institution of proceedings or action. [Ponnamma v. Arumugam (8 N.L.R. 223 at 226), Silva v. Nona

Hamine (10 N.L.R. 44), Ponnamma v. Weerasuriya (11 N.L.R. 217), Silva v. Fernando et al (15

N.L.R. 499), Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo et al (22 N.L.R. 268 at 272), Shariff et al v.

Marikkar et al (27 N.L.R. 349), Eminona v. Mohideen (32 N.L.R. 145), De Silva et al v. Goonetileke

et al (32 N.L.R. 217), De Silva v. Edirisuriya (41 N.L.R. 457), Lenorahamy v. Abraham (43 N.L.R. 68),

Kader Mohideen & Co. Ltd., v. Gany ( 60 N.L.R. 16), Abayadeera and 162 others v. Dr. Stanley

Wijesundera, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo and another (1983) 2 Sri. L. R. 267), Talagune

v. De Livera (1997) 1 Sri. L. R. 253, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd. and others v. Minister of Labour and

Vocational Training and others (1998) 1 Sri. L. R. 235, Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank (1998) 3

Sri. L. R. 197, Jayaratna v. Jayaratne and another (2002) 3 Sri. L. R. 331, Sithy Makeena and others

v. Kuraisha and others (2006) 2 Sri. L. R. 341).

However, it is not an immutable principle and courts have recognized certain exceptions to the

general rule.

In Sabapathipil/ai et al v. Vaithialingam (40 N.L.R. 107) it was held that a trustee whose term of

office expired during the pendency of an action brought by him, is not entitled to continue the

action. Similar approach was taken in Appusinno v. 8alasuriya (16 N.L.R. 385) by Ennis J. when

he held that the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance gave no power to appoint a provisional

trustee when the office became vacant by expiration of time, that the plaintiff had no status to

continue the action the moment he ceased to be trustee and that the principle that a case must

be decided as at the time of the institution of the suit cannot be applied to this case.

In Thangavadivel v. Inthiravathy (53 N.L.R. 369) where proceedings by way of summary

procedure under section 10 of the Jaffna Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance were

instituted by a wife against her husband for the return of certain jewelry, but while the inquiry

was proceeding, a decree absolute was entered in a divorce case dissolving the marriage between

the spouses, it was held that the plaintiff, having ceased to be the wife of the defendant during

the pendency of the inquiry, lost her status to continue the proceedings and the general rule that

the claims of the litigants are to be ascertained as at the commencement of the action would not

be applicable in such a case. In Mariam Nurban Hussain Teyabally v. Hon. R. Premadasa and two

others [S.c. No. 69/92, S.C.M. 05.11.1993] G.P.S. De Silva c.J. held (at page 5) that the general

principle of law that the right of parties are determined as at the date of action has no application

in the statutory context. In Master Drivers (Pvt) Ltd. v. Karunaratne and others [CA (PHC) APN

140/2012, C.A.M. 09.08.2018] I held that when entering judgment in a foreign currency the rupee

value at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment together with legal interest should

also be entered therein.

But I am of the view that none of the exceptions to the general rule applies in this case and that

the learned District Judge correctly did not take into consideration the effect of permits marked

D1 and D2.

Page 6 of7

In any event, there are several inconsistencies in the evidence of the said T.N. Pushpa Kumari,

Field Advisor, Divisional Secretariat, Ambalanthota when she was recalled in 1999 to give

evidence on permits D1 and D2. First, she testifies that the land in dispute comprises of 3 acres

of which 1 ~ acres is high land and 3 acres is paddy land [Proceedings of 23.02.1999, page 2] and

that 1 ~ acres of high land was given to Lalith Kumara [Proceedings of 23.02.1999, pages 2 and

3]. It was stated later that Lalith Kumara gave back 1 ~ acres of high land to the State and then

the permit given to Lalith Kumara was cancelled and three new permits issued to Lalith Kumara

and pt and 2nd Defendants [Proceedings of 23.02.1999, page 3].

Furthermore, it was accepted by T.N. Pushpa Kumari, Field Advisor, Divisional Secretariat,

Ambalanthota when she testified for the first time that Siyadoris had nominated the Plaintiff as

his successor. Then upon the death of the Plaintiff, in the absence of a nominated successor the

title to the land in dispute must in terms of section 72 of the Ordinance devolve as prescribed in

Rule I of the Third Schedule. The permits D1 and D2 appears to have been issued contrary to the

said provisions.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Hambanthota dated 06.12.1999.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
