AAL D.D.P. Dassanayake for the Accused-Petitioner-Appellant

The Accused-Petitioner-Appellant - On 29.04.2019

The Respondents-Respondents - On 08.05.2019

28.05.2019

The Accused-Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of Provincial High Court of North Western

province holden in Kurunegala dated 26.06.2015 in case No. HCR 114/2012 and

seeking to revise the sentencing order of the Learned Magistrate of Wariyapola

dated 19.07.2011 in Case No. 82704. At the stage of argument, on 01.03.2019,

both parties agreed to file written submissions and to abide by the same.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was

charged in the Magistrate's Court of Wariyapola under 04 counts for cheating a

sum of Rs. 1,050,0001= by using a forged deed. The appellant pleaded not guilty

on 01.03.2011 and accordingly the case was fixed for trial. However on the first

date of the trial, namely on 14.06.2011, the appellant revised his plea and pleaded

guilty to the charges. The appellant agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 100,0001= per

Page 3 of9

month from January 2012 to the aggriev~d party. The Learned Magistrate

convicted the appellant and imposed a term of 06 months rigorous imprisonment

r and a fine of Rs.1 0001= with a default term of 03 months simple imprisonment for

each charge. Accordingly the aggregated term of imprisonment with default

sentence was 03 years.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an appeal to the

Provincial High Court of North Western province holden in Kurunegala under case

No. HCA 32/2011. The appellant was not present when the case was taken up in

the High Court on three occasions and therefore the Learned High Court Judge

dismissed the said appeal due to lack of interest of the appellant. Thereafter the

appellant made a revision application to the Provincial High Court under case No.

HCRl114/2012. The respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') ni'ised a preliminary objection that the appellant had not attached

material documents and failed to obtain permission of High Court to submit them

at a later stage. The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the said revision

application on 26.06.2015.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the merits of the case.

2. The appellant is unable to pay a sum of Rs. 100,0001= monthly to the

aggrieved party since a jail term has been imposed.

3. The sentence imposed on the appellant is excessive.

4. The appellant is an unmarried person and takes care of his mother who is

suffering from high blood pressure.

I observe that the respondent, in the High COl~rt, has raised a preliminary objection

in terms of section 3(1) (a) of Appellate Court Rules. Accordingly it was

, contended that even though the appellant averred in the petition that the entire case

record of case No.82704 was attached as 'X", the documents marked as 'X" was

the case record of Case No. HCA 32/2011 which was filed in the High Court of

Kurunegala. Further it was submitted that a case record bearing No. 86017 was

attached and it has no relevance to the instant case.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant in his written submissions sought

permission of the High Court to submit a copy of the said case record bearing No.

82704. It was further submitted that the appellant failed to submit the Magistrate's

Court case record since it was sent back to the Magistrate's Court of Wariyapola

from the High Court of Kurunegala after the appeal bearing No. HCA 32/2011 was

dismissed. This' question was addressed by the Learned High Court Judge as

follows;

However it is noteworthy that the Learned High Court Judge has considered merits

of the application as follows;

It appears that the Learned High Court Judge did not dismiss the application

merely on a technical error but on principles applicable to a revision application.

In the case of M. Roshan Dilruk Fernando V. AG [CA (PHC) 03/2016], it was

held that,

"In the present case the Petitioner as of a right would have appealed against

the sentence on a question of law. Without exercising that right of appeal, he

opted to move Court in revision. It is settled law that the extraordinary

jurisdiction of revision can be invoked only on establishing the exceptional

circumstances. The requirement of exceptional circumstances has been held

in a series of authorities ... "

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd.

(2003) 3 SLR 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal ... "

In the case of W.M.F.G. Fernando V. Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.1108/99 (F)], it was held that,

Page 6 of 9

"It is trite law that the purpose of revis/onary jurisdiction is supervisory in

nature, and that the object is the proper administration of justice. In

r Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice

and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a party who is entitled to it, may claim to have as

of right, and its object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order

of court which is tainted by error. .. "

In light of above it is understood that revisionary powers of this Court shall not be

exercised unless there are any exceptional circumstances. It is mandatory to

distinguish the purpose of an appeal and a revision application. It has been

constantly held that the purpose of revisionary powers is not to relieve grievances

of a party but to correct any errors, irregularities or illegalities in lower court

orders. Therefore the Learned High Court Judge was correct in not considering

grievances of the appellant such as medical condition of the appellant's mother

under the revision application.

The Learned SSC for the respondent contended that sentencing the appellant for a

term of 06 months for count 1, 2 and 3 each is not excessive since the relevant

sections in the Penal Code allow imposing a term of imprisonment which may

extend to seven years. It was further submitted that the sentence for the count No.4

is not excessive since section 386 of the Penal Code allows imposing a term of

imprisonment which may extend to two years. Therefore I am of the view that this

Court is not inclined to interfere with an order made by the Learned Magistrate

exercising the discretion vested on hirn/her unless there had been a miscarriage of

justice as mentioned above.

Page 7 of 9

It was held in the case of Attorney General V. Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and

another [1995] 1 Sri L.R 157 that,

"In determining the proper sentence the Judge should consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration ... "

In the case of The Attorney General V. Mendis [1995] 1 Sri L.R. 138 it was held

that,

"In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,

or after trial, the Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That is to

decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been

convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused on

the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge

must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner in

which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which it

has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in

committing the crime ... "

Page 8of9

I observe that the appellant had pleaded gqilty to the charges and the Learned

Magistrate convicted him accordingly. Further it is observed that the Learned

Magistrate was mindful of the fact that the appellant had one previous conviction

as well.

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was

correct in refusing to interfere with the order made by the Learned Magistrate

exercising judicial discretion. Therefore I affirm both orders of the Learned High

Court Judge of Kurunegala and the Learned Magistrate ofWariyapola.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
