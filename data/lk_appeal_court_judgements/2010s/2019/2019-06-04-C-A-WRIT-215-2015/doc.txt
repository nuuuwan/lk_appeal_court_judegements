Respondents.

Samayawardhena, J.

By document marked X dated 02.11.2010, the Deputy

Commercial Superintendent of the Railway Department has

allowed the petitioner to maintain a temporary parking area in

the premises of the Wadduwa Railway Station for one year from

01.11.2010 on payment of a monthly rental. In that document

it has specifically been mentioned that the petitioner shall

unconditionally hand over the said parking area whenever it is

needed to the Railway Department.

The petitioner has used this parking area to earn money by

allowing the railway commuters to park their vehicles such as

motor bikes, push bikes etc.

Even though by this informal document, temporary permission

has been given to the petitioner (to do a business) only for one

year, he has continued to use that area until he got the letter

marked X13 dated 20.04.2015 from the Commercial

Superintendent of the Railway Department asking the petitioner

to hand over the possession of the said parking area to the

Railway Master of the Wadduwa Railway Station on or before

20.05.2015 as that area is required to the Railway Department.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash X13 by

certiorari and compel the General Manager/Commercial

Superintendent of Sri Lanka Railways by mandamus to allow

the petitioner to continue to use the parking area as usual.

It is quite obvious that X13 cannot be quashed by certiorari as

the said decision is neither illegal nor unjustifiable. By informal

document marked X1, the petitioner has been temporarily

allowed to use the State land for a period of one year, and

3

thereafter he has been using it for another around four years (by

payment of a monthly rent) without any objection from the

respondents. In X1, as I have already stated, there was a

condition that the petitioner shall hand over the parking area

whenever he has been asked to do. There is no necessity in the

facts and circumstances of this case to give him a hearing before

he is asked to leave because the arrangement was a temporary

one. There is no room for the petitioner to have a legitimate

expectation that he could continue to use the State land in the

Wadduwa Railway Station premises to carry out a business for a

profit forever.

There is absolutely no public duty on the part of the General

Manager/Commercial Superintendent of Sri Lanka Railways to

allow the petitioner to occupy the said State land to conduct his

private business. Nor has the petitioner any legal right to insist

on the said officials to do so. Writ will not issue for private

purposes.

In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte [1984] 1 Sri

LR 195 at 199 a Full Bench of the Supreme Court stated:

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty,

in the performance of which an applicant has sufficient

legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus the duty to

be performed must be of a public nature and not of merely

private character.

The Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say

for the enforcement of a mere private duty stemming from a

contract or otherwise. Contractual duties are enforceable by

the ordinary contractual remedies such as damages,

specific performance or injunction. They are not enforceable

4

by Mandamus which is confined to public duties and is not

granted where there are other adequate remedies.

There is no merit in this application.

Application is dismissed with costs.
