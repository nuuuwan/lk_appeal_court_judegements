Performance bonds, sometimes called bank guarantees, are typically issued by a financial

institution at the request of a party to a contract. These bonds are often issued pursuant

to an obligation contained in a construction contract. They take the form of a promise by

the issuing institution that it will pay to the benefiCiary named in the bond, an amount up

to the limit set out in the bond unconditionally or on specified conditions and without reference

to the terms of the contract between the parties.

Such a performance bond figures in the case and the bond was issued by the Insurance

Corporation of Sri lanka ("Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation" or "the Defendant-

Petitioner" or "the Defendant-Petitioner Corporation" as it is hereinafter sometimes

referred to) with a promise to pay the beneficiary Project Director, Southern Province Rural

Development Project in the event of a default in the performance of a construction contract

by the Iddamalgoda Commercial Company. So the underlying construction contract was

between the Project Director, Southern Province Rural Development Project and the Iddamalgoda

Commercial Company. The performance bond was issued to compensate the Project

Director, Southern Province Rural Development Project in the event of a default in the

performance of the contract by the Iddamalgoda Commercial Company. There was indeed

a default alleged in the performance of the construction contract by the Iddamalgoda

Commercial Company and the Honorable Attorney-General (the Plaintiff-Respondent)

2

.'.

sued the Insurance Corporation of Sri lanka (the issuer of the performance bond or the

Defendant-Respondent) on behalf of the Project Director, Southern Province Rural Development

Project (the beneficiary of the monies due under the performance bond). The performance

bond as it styles itself in the document limits the liability of the issuer of the bond-Sri

lanka Insurance Corporation to a sum of Rs. 216,457.05.

There had been two demands made on the bond prior to the institution of the suit in the

District Court and the question that arose as a preliminary issue before the District Court

of Colombo was whether the action was prescribed as the Defendant-Petitioner claimed

that the action was filed 6 years after the demand had been made. The Defendant-

Petitioner Sri lanka Insurance Corporation traversed in its answer that it is section 6 of

the Prescription Ordinance that would apply and as such the plaint was prescribed on the

face of it.

It is this preliminary issue that was gone into under Section 146 of the Civil Procedure

Code and the primary issue to be determined by this Court would then be which provision

of the Prescription Ordinance would apply as the learned Deputy Solicitor General has

now contended before this Court that it is Section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance that

would apply in this instance. I would begin with the order made by the learned Additional

District Judge of Colombo on the preliminary issue.

By the order dated 8th February 2007, the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo

held inter alia that:-

a) The applicable period of prescription was 6 years.

b) The Plaintiff had demanded payment on 16th December 1996 and 06th August 1997.

c) The Plaintiff filed action within 6 years of sending the demand.

Thus, the learned Additional District Judge held that the applicable period of prescription

was 6 years but came to the conclusion that the plaint had been filed within 6 years of the

demand, even though the 1st demand marked P3 had been made on 16th December 1996 and

there had been a lapse of more than 6 years since the 1st demand before the action came to

be filed. In fact it is quite clear upon a perusal of the plaint that the action had been filed

3

-,

.',

06 years, 08 months and 6 days after the 1st demand dated 16th December 1996. The plaint

filed by the Attorney-General representing the Project Director, Southern Province Rural

Development Project, is dated 28th August 2003.

Thus, as is evident from the order of the learned Additional District Judge, despite it being

as plain as the pikestaff that the action had been filed 06 years, 08 months and 6 days after

the 1st demand for payment, the learned Additional District Judge held that the action had

been filed within 06 years of the demand. Thus his final conclusion does not follow the

basis on which he decided the applicable law for prescription namely section 6 of the

Presctiption Ordinance.

I must say that the learned Additional District Judge had accepted the fact that the

applicable period of prescription in respect of the performance bond was 6 years in terms

of Section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance and if that was the legal position, it was argued

by the learned Counsel for the Defendant- Petitioner (Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation)

that the cause of action was dearly prescribed having regard to the fact that the action

was filed 06 years, 08 months and 6 days after the 1st demand dated 16th December 1996.

Is the prescriptive period for the performance bond 10 years as the learned Deputy Solicitor

General argued or is it 6 years as the learned counsel for the Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation (the issuer of the performance bond) contended?

Before I resolve this question, let me focus on the nature and ambit of the instrument in

contention namely the performance bond as the title of the document calls itself.

Performance Bonds-Unconditional or Conditional

As Ellinger's Modern Banking Law authored by Peter Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka and

Christopher Hare (yh Edition,) declares at p 904,

" .. ,Sometimes the term guarantee is used within the banking industry even though it is not a

guarantee in the sense of being predicated upon the default of another party. A common form of

security is an unconditional 'performance guarantee'-1110re properly described as a performance

bond-given by a bank in favour of a beneficiary to secure the obligatiOns under a contract, often

4

to be performed overseas. Examples include a bond given to an owner to secure the performance

of the contractor pursuant to a building contract or given to a vendor of goods to secure payment

of the purchase price by the buyer. The usual unconditional performance bond makes it

clear that the bank is liable to pay Simply upon a demand being made by the beneficiary, as in a

bond which states "the ballk unconditionally undertakes and covenants to pay 011 demand any sum

or sums which may from time to time be demanded".

So the benefiCiary in an unconditional performance guarantee or bond is entided to

demand the sums without proving any default by the other party to the underlying

transaction and the bank must pay unless it knows the claim is fraudulent-see Edward

Owen Engineering Ltd v BarclaysBank International Limited (1978) 1 QB 159; Turkiye

Is Bankasi AS v Bank of China (1996) 2 Lloyd's Rep 611 and, on appeal, (1998) 1 Lloyd's

Rep.2S0.

Two types of performance bonds

Thus one could see that a performance bond may be issued with or without conditions

attached. When a perfonnance bond is made payable without any conditions attached, a

simple demand by a benefiCiary is sufficient to bring on the obligation of the bank or

financial institution issuing the bond to make the payment under the bond. When a valid

call for payment is made by a beneficiary, a bank or financial institution like an insurance

corporation which issues the bond comes under an immediate liability to make payment

under the bond. There is no necessity to prove default on the part of the party to the

underlying transaction. This is the essence of an unconditional performance guarantee or

bond or an on-demand bank guarantee as it is called in its varied appellations.

A performance bond may also be issued with conditions attached. When conditions are

attached to the payment of a performance bond, it becomes a conditional performance

bond. Under a conditional performance bond or guarantee, proof of default is required

which means that there will have to be an extensive investigation of the facts and possibly

a lengthy trial before payment will be ordered. Whatever the description of the bond

issuer's undertaking, the terminology used is not conclusive and whether a performance

5

.'

bond is payable on demand (an unconditional performance bond or an independent bank

guarantee or an on-demand bank guarantee) or it is payable upon proof of default as a

conditional bank guarantee it is an interpretation of the substance of the obligation

undertaken rather than form. In American Home Assurance Company v Hong Lam

Marine Pte Ltd (19993 SLR 682), the Singapore Court of Appeal stated:

"the term 'peljormanc,; bond' or 'performance guaralltee' is sometimes used to denote a genuine

contract of guarantee and indemnity. To make matters even more confuSing, a guarantee or

indemnity may be given in circumstances in which one might expect to find a true performance

bond. The nature of the particular contract, whether it /wppens to be a guarantee or an indemnity,

or a performance bond and whether the nonnal incidents of a contract of that class have been

modified, is ultimately a question of construction in each case, and is often very difficult to

I " reso ve ...

For an English case for distinguishing between true demand and suretyship guarantees see

Wuhan Guoyu Logistics Group Co Ltd v Emporiid Bank of Greece (Court of Appeal)

(2013) EWCA Civ 1679.

So the question arises how this Court would charactetize the performance bond in

question before this court. The nomenclature used in the document itself namely

"performance bond" is not determinative of the question whether it is an unconditional

performance guarantee ( or an on-demand bank guarantee), which requires the service of

a demand on the issuer or it is just a conditional bank guarantee that requires the proof of

default on the part of the contractor, Iddamalgoda Commercial Company.

In order to ascertain the true nature of the bond it is the substance of the performance

bond that has to be looked at and moreover there are other indicia one has to bear in mind

in the process of looking at the substance of the contract. In my view the real issue of a

performance bond is one of commercial interpretation and it raises the question of

examining the intent of the document.

6

,.

The context in which the parties entered into the contract would also go to prove the

intent of the parties and this can be gathered from the pleadings, accompanying

documents and issues at the trial. So before looking at the substance of the performance

bond, let me examine the pleadings, accompanying documents and issues in order to

understand the commercial context in which the performance bond was issued.

An examination of the plaint filed by the Attorney-General on behalf of the benefiCiary of

the bond and the issues raised in the District Court nowhere show any assertion that the

bond in question is a conditional bank guarantee so that the Plaintiff would lead evidence

and prove default on the part of the building contractor i.e Iddamlagoda Commercial

Company. The issues raised on behalf of the Plaintiff do not show that the Plaintiff was

suing on a traditional bank guarantee i.e a conditional bank guarantee. In a conditional

bank guarantee the liability of the guarantor is secondary. A guarantor is liable to pay the

creditor only if the principal debtor is liable in the first instance and has defaulted on his

obligations. The main obligation is comprehensively covenanted into the underlying

contract marked as PI wherein the contractor -Iddamalgoda Commercial Company has

promised to pay the employer the Project Director, Southern Province Rural Development Project

by way of liquidated damages a sum of Rs 1082 for each and every day if the contractor

fails to complete the work by the agreed date or extended date by the Employer.

In other words the plaint does not refer to any attempt to demand damages from the

contractor who is the principal debtor. No letter of demand was ever sent to Iddamalgoda

Commercial Company the contractor on the basis of primary liability-a requirement that

has to be followed in the case of a conditional guarantee or traditional guarantee. Instead

the Plaintiff acted as if the Sri Lanka lnsurance Corporation was primarily liable for the

breach of the contractor and accordingly demanded payment by calls made on 16.12.1996

and 06.08.1997. Even the demand made on 16.12.1996 sets out the breach committed by the

contractor and demands payment of Rs 216457.03 forthwith.

If a beneficiary demands immediate payment from the issuer, the conduct is consistent

with that of a person in possession of an unconditional or on-demand performance bond,

7

because it is only under an unconditional performance bond that the payment obligation

is triggered by a demand.

The above indicates that the Plaintiff came into court armed with an on-demand

performance bond. The assurance of that instrument is that it is independent of the

underlying obligation and requires no proof of default in the performance of the primary

obligation namely the construction undertaken by the Iddamalgoda Commercial Company.

Upon a perusal of the answer filed by the issuer of the bond -Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation and the preliminary issues based on its defence of extinctive prescription, it

is clear that Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation had issued an unconditional performance

guarantee. The answer pleaded that the action was prescribed because it had been

instituted after 6 years from the demand. This is a recognition by the issuer that its

payment obligation is triggered by a demand. The answer does not aver that the damages

claimed in the plaint have to be established as arising out of a breach of the underlying

contract.

This recognition of an on-demand guarantee also emerges from the preliminary issues.

Implied recognition that the performance bond is payable on demand

Issue No 12 that was tried as a preliminary issue and the written submissions filed thereon

impliedly recognize that the prescriptive period must be computed from the date of the

demand. The preliminary issues No 11 and 12 which were raised by the Defendant-

Petitioner Cotporation (the issuer of the performance bond) went as follows:

11. Does the plaint confirm to the imperative provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and in particular

Sections 40, 44, 46 and 50?

12.1s the Plaintiff's action /?rescribed 011 the face of the plaint?

As the written submission filed by the Defendant-Respondent Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation on Issue No 12 demonstrates, it had based its prescriptive plea on the 6 year

period prescribed in Section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance and the period had been

8

computed from the date of the 1" demand namely 16.12.1996. ImpliCit in this issue and its

explanation in the written submission is the admission that the Sri lanka Insurance

Corporation had issued an on-demand performance bond or an unconditional

performance bond.

Thus I would make the observation that it was the case of both parties in the District

Court that the performance bond in question was payable on demand. The Plaintiff was

attempting to enforce an immediate payment obligation without recourse to the

underlying contract, whilst the Defendant was resisting the action on the basis that the

action had become passe because the 6th year period had elapsed from the date of the 1"

demand.

Even the Plaintiff-Respondent in their written submissions filed on 29th May 2009 admits

that the prescriptive period has to be calculated from the date of the demand. The only

inference I reach upon these facts which are quite apparent on the face of the pleadings,

documents and issues is that both parties-the Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-

Petitioner intended demand to be a term of the performance bond though I hasten to point

out that the performance bond does not contain the usual words-"payable on demand".

Implication of t he term "On Demand" into the performance bond

Even if the words "on demand" are absent from the performance bond in question, one

can imply terms into a commercial contract and in the decision of the Australian High

Court in Byrne v A ustralian Airlines Ltd ( 1995) 185 ClR 410, it was laid down that when

the question of implication of terms arises, the question is whether the implication of the

particular terms is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of the contract in

the circumstances of the case; only where this can be seen to be true will the term be

implied-for a similar approach towards implying "on demand calls" into the banker-

customer relationship- see the English Court of Appeal decision of Joachim son v Swiss

Bank Corporation (1921) 3 K.B. no where it was established that no cause of action arises

against a bank in respect of money standing in current account until the customer

demands payment by the bank. joachimson's case is to the effect that thc parties can "intend

9

.

.-

to make the demand a term of the contract. Atkin LJ posed the question-"did the parties

in fact intend to make the demand a term of the contract? ..... .in seeking to ascertain their

intention the nature of the contract may be material."

So it boils down to this question. Did the parties intend the performance bond to

predicate payment upon demand?

Upon a perusal of the pleadings, documents and issues raised in the case, I have held that

they did so. The intention remains to be looked at from the substance of the bond too.

When I look at some clauses in the performance bond in question it becomes crystal clear

that for the sake of commercial efficacy of their relationship the parties intended the

performance bond to be payable upon demand.

Renunciation of benefits and privileges belonging to guarantors

The performance bond clearly shows that the surety (the Sri lanka Insurance

Corporation) has renounced the well-known privileges accorded to sureties, namely

beneficium ordinis divisionis et excussionis (sic) by which a surety is entitled to claim that, as his

liability is of an accessory character, it shall not be enforced against him until the creditor

has unsuccessfully endeavored to obtain satisfaction from the principal debtor; the

beneficium divisionis prOvides for the apportionment of liability among the co-sureties.

In the Roman-Dutch law (as in English law), there are several well-established privileges

and defenses afforded to guarantors when sued by the creditor. A guarantor in Sri lanka

is entitled to the following defenses or privileges if he has not expressly renounced them.

I) Beneficium ordinis seu excussionis-the benefit of excussion

This benefit or privilege is known as benefit of excussion or discussion which is quite aptly

described as "beneficium ordinis seu excussionis". This was introduced by Justinian, by a Novel-

see Roman Private Law founded on the Institutes of Gaius and Justinian (1906) by Richard William

leage at page 285. The word "ordinis" in the term "beneficium ordinis .leu eXCLIssionis" relates to

the order in which the creditor may pursue his remedies, first against the principal debtor

and thereafter against the surety. In other words, it is the right of the surety against the

10

-.

creditor to have him proceed first against the principal debtor with a view to obtaining

payment from him, if necessary by execution upon his assets, before turning to the surety

for payment of the debt or of so much of it as remains unpaid. In other words, the creditor

is to excuss the assets of the debtor before turning to the surety is expressed in the word

"cxCLlssiollis" which sometimes appears as "disClissionis"-see the incisive discussion by Ralph

Slovenko "Suretyship" (1965) 39 Tulane Law Review 427 at 447: also see Caney's the Law

of Suretyship (yh Edition 2002 by Christopher Forsyth &: JT Pretorius) at 119.

If I may relate this privilege to the case at bar, the guarantor (Sri Lanka Insurance

Company) is entitled to ask the creditor (the Project Director, Southern Province Rural

Development Project) to first proceed against the principal debtor (Iddamalgoda Commercial

Company in this case) and to claim the debt from the guarantor only if the creditor is

unable to recover it from the principal debtor; see- Gurusin Appu v. Cariina Hamine

(1897) 2 N.LR 307.

This benefit has been renounced by the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation in this case.

2) Beneficium Divisionis-the benefit of division

As between the sureties themselves a rescript by Hadrian introduced the beneficium

divisionis, which enabled one of several sureties when sued for the whole debt to demand

that the claim should be divided between himself and the other solvent sureties. In other

words this benefit requires the creditor to divide his claim among all the solvent sureties,

so that each is liable for his share only.

It would appear that both these two benefits or privileges have been waived or abandoned

by the surety Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. Any renouncement of rights and privileges

has to be intentional, unambiguous and clear. The Courts have held that the renunciation

of a guarantor's rights must be express. The renunciation must be deliberate and with a

full knowledge of the rights he is renouncing. A general renunciation is valid only if the

guarantor hin1self is a lawyer or if he declares in writing that he had a full knowledge of

the rights he is renouncing: see Amerasinghe v Perera (1934) 35 N.LR 306.

11

;

If one peruses the performance bond in question, I find that the Insurance Corporation of

Sri Lanka has renounced these two privileges as the following paragraph of the

performance bond clearly shows.

"We the surety hereby renouncing the beneficium ordinis divisionis at excussionis the meaning,

force and effect of renouncing which /1Qve been explained to us by our Proctor and with which we

hereby declare that we are now fully acquainted and all other benefits, privileges and advantages to

wilicil sureties as such are by law emitled ...... " (SiC).

Since there are no co-sureties, one cannot understand as to how waiver of beneficium

divisionis will have a role in this case but it is quite clear that the beneficium ordinis (or

excussionis or discussionis) has been waived by the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. In other

words the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation binds itself as a co-principal debtor in solidum.

In solidum would mean "in the whole", i.e., the whole amount of the debt.

The effect of renunciation-Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation becomes a principal

debtor-the performance bond becomes an indemnity.

Once these Roman-Dutch Law and English Law privileges are waived, the guarantor is

Virtually a prinCipal debtor. He assumes primary liability and the guarantee becomes an

indemnity. A suit against the indemnifier (Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation) alone is

properly constituted, because the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation has become the

principal debtor.

The adoption of this approach leads almost ineluctably to the conclusion that once the

performance bond is also an indemnity, the Plaintiff does not have to prove default with

reference to the underlying contract but can proceed to sue the indemnifier (Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation) on the promise to compensate embodied in the performance bond.

The renunciation also reiterates the independence or autonomy of the payment obligation

contained in the performance bond and so the above construction I arrive at points

unerringly to the on-demand guarantee or indemnity that the performance bond in

question is all about.

12

..

Having identified the nature of the assurance document in question let me now turn to

quintessential question for resolution. It is payable on demand. The prescriptive period

would run from the date of the demand. Is the period 10 years according to section 5 or 6

years according to section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance?

Synopsis of Ordinance

A. Section 5 - No action shall be maintainable

a) for the recovery of any sum due upon any hypothecation or mortgage of any

property; or

b) upon any bond conditioned for

i. the payment of money

ii. the performance of any agreement or trust or

iii. the payment of penalty

unless the same be commenced

a) in the case of an instrument payable at or providing for the performance of its

condition within a definite time, within ten years of the expiration oj such time and

b) in all other cases

i. within ten years from the date oj such instnlmcnt or mortgage or hypothecation; or

ii. oJlast payment oJinterest thereon; or

iii. oj the breach oj the condition.

B. Section 6 - No action shall be maintainable

i. upon any deed for establishing a partnership; or

ii. upon any promissory note or bill of exchange; or

iii. a) upon any written promise, contract, bargain, or agreement, or

b) other written security not falling within the description of instruments

set forth in section 5

unless such action shall be brought

13

a) within six years from the date of the breach of such partnership deed or of such

written promise, contract, bargain or agreement, or other written security, or

b) from the date when such note or bill shall gave become due; or

tv. of the last payment of interest thereon the performance of any agreement or trust

or

v. the payment of penalty

The learned Deputy Solicitor General placed reliance on the words "upon any bond

conditioned for the payment of money" in Section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance and

characterized the performance bond as a species under section 5 and therefore his

contention was that the prescriptive period was 10 years.

His argument was that the assurance document was an instrument conditioned to pay

money. That raises the question of nature of the indemnity that the performance bond has

become in the end.

In Tissera VS. Tissera (1896) 2 N.LR. 238, Bonser c.j. discussing the meaning of "bond

conditioned for the payment of money," found in section 6 (now section 5), said, "In

English law bond means a deed poll, whereby the obligor binds himself to pay money or

do some act .... lt seems to me that the attestation of an instrument by a notary may be

regarded as a solemn act equivalent to the formality of the affixing of their seals by the

parties to an English deed. So that in this Island a deed may be defined as a writing attested

by a notary, and a bond as the acknowledgment of or promise to pay a debt in an

instrument attested by a notary .... "The expression conclitioned for the payment of money"

means, in my opinion, a bond debt in an instrument is given for the securing the payment

of money."

For Bonser CJ the essentials of notarial attestation and the existence of a bond debt are

ingredients of Section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The performance bond under consideration is not one that is notarially attested nor it is

an instrument that evidences debt. The fact that hypothecation or mortgage of any

property is found in the section followed by a bond conditioned to pay money is a pointer

14

to the interpretation placed by Bonser C.J because in mortgages and hypothecation that

are mentioned first there is a debt bond because a mortgage is executed in order to secure

the payment of a loan. Notarial attestation is mandated for a mortgage whilst it is not a

legal requirement that a guarantee or an indemnity need be notarially attested. So on the

strength of interpretation in Tissera vs. Tissera (supra), a performance bond or a

guarantee or indemnity cannot fall within Section 5 as the substantial requirement of

notarial attestation is a must for mortgages whilst it is not so for a performance bond or a

guarantee or indemnity under the laws of Sri Lanka. It is noteworthy that whilst a

guarantee has to be in writing, an indemnity does not even necessitate such a requirement.

On the lines of Tissera v Tissera (supra) in Suppramaniapillai v Kalikutty 11 N.LR 71 at

72 the Supreme Court stated

As ngards section 6 (now Section 5) of Ordinance No 22 of 1871, it seems to me to contemplate

only such instruments as are usually embodied in the external formality and solemnity of a deed

under English Law. In our system of legal procedure the nearest approach to a deed in point of

solemnity is a notarially executed document. Bonser C] in Tissera v Tissera said that in this island

a deed might be defined as a writing attested by a notary, and a bond as an ac1mowledgment of or

promise to pay a debt in an instrument attested by a notary.

I think, therefore, that if a document purports to be stamped as an agreement executed notarially,

and contains a condition for the payment of money on the non-fulfilment of its agreed terms, that

it may well be deemed /0 be a bond within the meaning of section 6 (now section 5) ...... "

later in Suth ukkumah v Vachchra vagee 12 N.LR 289, the Supreme Court held that an

agreement was not a 'bond' within the meaning of secti on 5 of the Prescription Ordinance

since it had not been notarially attested and that the lack of notarial attestation made the

document a written agreement within the provisions of section 6 of the Prescription

Ordinance.

15

It would thus appear that only a mortgage bond hypothecating property or a notarially

attested document would fall within the provisions of section 5 of the Prescription

Ordinance attracting a prescriptive period of]O years.

But in Seman vs. Silva (1915) 18 N.LR. 397, Ennis J. (with De Sampayo J. agreeing)

expressed a different view and said, "In my opinion the lease under which rent is claimed

is not a "bond conditioned for the payment of money and that it falls under section 7, and

not section 6 of the Ordinance No. 22 of 1871".

This case holds that though a lease is notarially attested, it is not a bond conditioned upon

payment of money.

It was held in this case that a notarial lease is a written contract or agreement within the

meaning of section 7 (now section 6) of the Ordinance No. 22 of 1871, and the period of

limitation in regard to an action for the recovery of rent due thereon is six years.

In the above case, De Sampayo J. said:

The word "bond" is used in Ordinance No. 22 of IB71 exactly in same sense as in the earlier

enactments, and an instrument should be construed as a bond or not according to its substance

and real characteristics, and not according to its form of execution.

Sampayo J made a very pertinent observation.

"Whatever a bond may be, I am quite sure that a lease is not a bond. Its main purpose is not to

secure the payment of money, but to vest the right of possession ofa land for a certain period in the

lessee. A lease also usually contains many subsidiary covenants, and Simply because one of these

covenants relates to the payment of rent, the instrument is not thereby constituted a bond. If the

rent is paid wholly in advance there will be no such covenant in the lease at all, and in such a case

there will be no shadow of reasons for calling it a bOlld. A lease belongs to the specific class of

contracts which the civil law calls locatio conductio, and in no way partakes of the nature of

a bOlld."

It follows that a bond conditioned for the payment of money clearly means an instrument

by which one person binds himself to another for the purpose of securing the payment of

money. Whether the document is notarially attested or not, the main purpose or

16

substance of the performance bond should be the payment of money. Then only it would

qualify under the term "bond" under section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Then the all important question arises-what is the substance of a performance bond? Is it

to pay only money?

On the nature and scope of a performance bond, Schmitt/lOff's Export Trade The Law and

Practice of International Trade (11th Edition, 2007) states thus at p 620.

" .... .It is usual for the contractor to proVide a performance guarantee which is issued by a bank,

insurance company or other third party. The guarantee is intended to safeguard the employer

against the failure of the contractor to perform his obligations under the contract .... "

Though one of the subSidiary terms of a performance guarantee is to pay money, the main

purpose or substantial object of the performance guarantee is to ensure the performance

of the contractual obligation . .i.e the construction undertaken in this instance.

So the performance bond in question is not a bond conditioned upon payment of money

alone as stipulated in section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance. In fact the employer in a

construction contract finds himself with two options. He can sue the contractor on the

underlying contract or call in the guarantee. If he has called in the guarantee and the

amount has exceeded the true loss, the provider of the bond is entitled to recover the

overpayment-see Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar & Food Industries

Corporation (1996) 2 Lloyd's Rep 424.

All this leads to the conclusion that the performance guarantee/indemnity stands on a

different footing from a mortgage bond or a bond conditioned upon payment of money and

I hold that section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance is inapplicable to the computation of

the limitation period of a demand guarantee or indemnity.

Section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance

No action shall be maintainable

iv. upon any deed for establishing a partnership; or

v. upon any promissory note or bill of exchange; or

VI. a) upon any written promise, contract, bargain, or agreement, or

b) other written security not falling within the description of instruments

set forth in section 5

unless such action shall be brought

c) within six years from the date of the breach of such partnership deed or of such

d) from the date when such note or bill shall gave become due; or

vi. of the last payment of interest thereon the performance of any agreement or trust

or

vii. the payment of penalty.

Some species of instruments that are mentioned in section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance

share identical features. For instance the promissory note or bill of exchange referred to in

section 6 is payable on demand unless a usance bill (a time bill) has been issued. In other

words these instruments can be converted into ready cash and performance

guarantees/indemnities partake of similar characteristics. They amount to ready cash. It

is for this reason that lord Denning MR described demand guarantees and on-demand

performance bonds as .......... virtually promissory notes payable on demand'-See Edward

Owen Engineering Ltd v Barclays International Limited (1978) QB 159 at 170; see also

Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar &: Food Industries Corp (1996) 2 All ER

563 at 568, per Morison] (upheld by CA (1998) 1 W.LR 461).

The performance bond would also fall within the general description 'any written promise,

contract, bargain or agreement" or "other written security not falling within the

description of instruments set forth in section 5."

The fact that guarantees are distinct and different from mortgages is brought out by the

case of Hatton National Bank v Sellers Sports (Pvt) Ltd (2000) 3 Sri.lR 326 wherein

the Supreme Court (per Sarath N. Silva C.], Perera] and WeerasekeraJ) held:

" ..... as regards the guarantee of the 2nd to 5th defendants, the applicable section is section 6 of the

Prescription Ordinance which relates to amounts due on a written promise or other written

18

securit), and the period of prescription is 6 years. That period should be computed not from the

date of the default on the principal obligation, but from the date on which the payment upon the

guarantee became due namely, 10 days after demand in writing was made, as stated in Clause 2 of

the agreement. The demand for payment was made on 26.04.1996, and the breach took place upon

the fa ilure to make payme/1t 10 days after the demand .. " ... "

The Supreme Court placed the mortgage bond-the other written security in the case

within section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance. The Supreme Court stated thus:

" ...... The action was filed to enforce the obligation created by the mortgage bond. The applicable

section would be Section 5 of the Prescription Ordinance which relates to instances where the

action is for the recovery of any sum due upon any mortgage of property or upon any bond

conditioned for the payment of money .... "

Thus the on-demand performance bond in this case falls fair and square under section 6 of

the Prescription Ordinance and the prescriptive period of 6 years would begin to run from

the date of the 1" demand namely 16th December 1996. The plaint filed on 26th August 2003,

long after the 6th year period had elapsed, was preSCribed on the face of it and the plaint

did not show any ground claiming exemption from the operation of prescription-see

Boteju v Rajanathan (1986) 1 Colombo Appellate Reports 385 which stated that

compliance with section 44 of the Civil Procedure Code is mandatory. In the

circumstances since this is an action which is ex facie prescribed, the plaint should have

been dismissed-see Soysa v Soysa 17 TLR 118.

But the learned Additional District Judge'S finding that the Plaintiff-Respondent had filed

this action within 6 years is erroneous and should be set aside.

Before I part with the judgment let me also advert to another argument that the learned

Deputy Solicitor General has taken up in his written submissions though this was not

raised in the course of oral submissions.

19

Rules of limitation have no application to State

Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance is invoked to advance this argument. At the very

outset I must say that tbs argument is inherently inc nsistent with the argument that

section 5 of the PrescriptlDn Ordinance applies to the performance bond in question. Let

me though appraise the applicability of section 15.

Section 15 makes reference to prescription against the Slate thus:

"Nothing herein contained shall in any way affect the rights of the state, or shall be when to apply

to any proceedings in any action for divorce, or to any case in which special provisioll has been

or may hereafter be made for regulating and determining the period withilllVhich actiolls may be

commenced againsti!lIIY publ ic officer or other persall ... "

This is expressed in ttlL Latin tag Nullum tempus OCCl!lTit regi or Nullum tempus occurrit

reipublicae-110 time runs against the state. According to Black'3 Law Dictionary (Tenth Eclition,

2014), the purpose of tI e rule is to fully protect public rights and property from injury.

Subsequently , uilum Tempus Act or the Crown Suit Act of 1769 (amended in 1862) was

passed and it enacted th~t the rights of the Crown in regard to lands and rents should be

barred after a lapse of 60 ~;i'~a rs. In terms of this Act, 60 ,/ea r ~ of ad\usc po~sess i on against

thc Crown was sufficiem to pass title to an ,\J\'CI'SC Pll~SC%Or. This statute then altered

the common law rule of Nullwn tempus aut locus occurrit regi ("no time or place alIects the

Crown"), which was based on the idea that the Crown was too busy with governmental

affairs to timely attend to its legal affairs. Nullum Tempus Act was repealrd [nI939.

We are dealing with a case of extinctive prescription set L.p against the State similarly but

in a case of a commerci contract which the agent of the State, Projecr Director, Southern '/ Provillce Rural DcvclopmCll. r'roject concluded with a contractor and the Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation issued an on-demand indemnity-another commercial undertaking to ensure

the performance of the lonstruction contract. When ~ he Insurance c.orporation issued

the performance bond ;, favor of the state functionary, it was indeed a commercial

20

I

transaction and the Project Director was acting as an agent of the state as if a private

citizen would for his print ipal.

Christopher Gregory Vv' eeramantry-the celebrated jurist and Vice President of the

International Court of Justice in his well known tome '(he Law of Contracts ( VoHl S 914-

page 868) sets out the position under the Roman Dutch law as follows:

"Ullder the Romall Dutch Law as well, the Crown would not be entitled to claim immunity from

the rules relatillg to prescription. Under that system, although prescription did 1I0t as a general

rule run against the l<rown, it did rUII agaillst the Crown where debts were due to it as though it

were a private illdividual so that if the right the CrowlI ,vas seeking to enforce was all ordinmy

right of property or all ordinary obligation, prescriptio1J could be pleaded against it Wessels, s

2778.

This principle did not thus apply ill regw-d to a claim b) the Crown relating to its 'irwlienablc

rights', this principle being thus limited ollly to rights capable of alienation."

~. So prescription could be iJlcaded against tbe statc if a debt is due to it out of an obligation

flowing from an indemnity. This debt arising out of the performance bond is certainly

transferable and shared by the state in its ventures. The proceeds of the performance bond

do not necessarily go into tbe exchequer of tbe central government and tbough the

Attorney General would recover it on behalf of the Project Director, it cannot be argued

that it becomes an inalienable property of tbe state.

I

The observations of We ,ds (supra at para 2777 and 27i8) on this issue is complemented

i by Voet. A person cannot allege that he is exempted frum paying a yearly tax because he

has not paid this particlilar tax for thirty years, but when sued for an overdue tax, Voet

holds tbat he can reply that the debt due by him to the Crown by virtue of tbe overdue tax

is prescribed in the form in which the action is brought

If a rigbt which the Government seeks to enforce is not an inalienable right of the Crown,

but an ordinary right of g~operty or an obligation; then it is bound by a Prescription Act

or statute of limitations.

21

,

One is at once reminded of Attorney-General v Wilson and Another (1997) 2 Sri LR

349 wherein Ameer Ismail J held that rights applicable to the state can be classified as

alienable rights and inalienable rights and further went on to recapitulate the passages I

have quoted above from Dr. Weeramantry. Ismail J's holding on damages by the State

being prescribed in three years having regard to the obsolete South African Act No 18 of

1943 is not directly in issue in this case and this Court is only concerned whether the

immunity contained in Section 15 of the Prescription Ordinance would avail the state

when it has engaged in a commercial transaction as if it were a private citizen.

I am fortified by Wessels and the English jurisprudence to hold that section 15 cannot be

invoked by the state in what would be called commercial contracts entered into by the

state or its agents. International Law makes a distinction between jure imperii (public acts

of the sovereign ) and jure gestionis (private acts of the sovereign). If the purpose of the

governmental act is to achieve an act of sovereignty, there is immunity. If the purpose of

the transaction is non-sovereign, there is no immunity. Once again this test looks to the

nature of the act-is it of a nature which is essentially a commercial transaction? -for an

inSightful discussion of the distinction between jure imperii and jure gestionis see the

Supreme Court decision of Bd6sh High Commission v Rkardo Wilhelm Mkhael

Jansen (S.c. Appeal No. 99/2012, SC Minutes of 10/07/2014).

The case of Trendtex Trading Corpon./tion v Bank o[Nigeria (1977) QB 529 gave effect

to the long emerging doctrine of restrictive immunity accorded to states and its organs. In

Trendtex Trading Corporation, Lord Denning M.R stated-

"If a government departmmt goes into the market places of the world and buys boots or cemmt, as a

commercial transaction that government departmmt should be subject to all the rules of the market

place. The seller is not concerned with the purpose to which the purchaser intends to put the goods."

In Trendtex Trading Corporation the Court held that in deciding whether it was jure

imperii or jure gestionis, it was enough if the transaction itself was of a commercial type- such

as a contract for the supply of goods or services. In the Trel1dtex case the court was

22

concerned primarily with the intrinsic nature of the arrangement entered into by the

Central Bank. On finding that the transaction was essentially 'commercial', the Bank had

not immunity, even if it could be ITgarded as performing functions and charged with the

purposes of an organ of the state. The conclusion that Lord Denning reached in Trendtex

was followed in the House of Lords in I Congreso del PareMo (1983) AC 244. Likewise

in Central Bank of Yemen v Cardinal Finance In vestm ents Corp (2000) EWCA Civ

266, a promissory note was enforceable between the parties as a commercial transaction

even though concluded by a state's central bank.

On the strength of these e<lses, one can observe that much water has flowed under the

bridge as far as prescription against state is concerned and section 15 of the Prescription

Ordinance cannot have the overbroad ambit as contended by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General.

[n the end as I said before, thc prescriptive plea set up by the Defendant Petitioner

succeeds and I would accordingly set aside the order made by the learned Additional

District Judge on 8th February 2007 and allow both the leave to appeal application and

appeal. The action filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent is therefore dismissedllLlnc pro tulle.
