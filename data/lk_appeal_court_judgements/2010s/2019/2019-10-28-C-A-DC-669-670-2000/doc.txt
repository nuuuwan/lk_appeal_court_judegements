Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking a

declaration of title to the land described as Lots A and B in Plan

No. 722 (P1), ejectment of the defendant of some portions of the

said land, and damages. The defendant got Plan No. 1199 (V1)

prepared with a superimposition of Plan P1 on it. In the answer

he claimed prescriptive title to Lots A, D2, D3, E, F and G of

Plan V1. After trial, the learned District Judge held with the

plaintiff subject to the condition that the defendant has

prescribed to the areas of land covered by improvements marked

1, 2, 3, 5 in red in Plan P1. Being dissatisfied with the

Judgment, both parties have preferred appeals. Both appeals

were taken up together and at the argument the learned

Presidents Counsel for both parties made submissions together.

This is a rei vindicatio action. The learned Presidents Counsel

for the defendant admits that the paper title to the land in suit is

with the plaintiff. The defendant is claiming prescriptive title to

some portions of the said land. If that is the position, there is

no further burden on the part of the plaintiff to discharge. The

burden lies fairly and squarely on the defendant to prove on

what right he is in possession of the plaintiffs land. If the

3

defendant states that he does so on prescriptive title, he must

prove it, and the plaintiff does not need to disprove it.

The submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

defendant is that the learned District Judge in his Judgment

has not properly analyzed the evidence led at the trial. In that

regard, the learned Presidents Counsel strenuously submits

that the learned District Judge has not taken into consideration

the admissions made by the plaintiff in cross examination that

she never went to the land after she became the owner in 1968

until the action was filed in 1984.

There is no law that the owner must possess the land.

Possession is an incidence or an attribute of ownership. The

owner can possess his property only if he wants.

Mere possession of the property of another is not tantamount to

prescriptive possession. The person claiming prescriptive title

shall prove all the ingredients stated in section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to succeed on a claim of

prescription. In that regard, he must inter alia prove when he

started adverse possession.

The evidence of the substituted defendant who gave evidence at

the trial was that, after marriage, she came to the house

No.141/2 in the land in suit in 1967 and from that day onwards

she had been living in the same house whilst enjoining the

plantation in the appurtenant land.1 The fact that she enjoyed

the plantation has been disputed by the plaintiff, who has stated

that coconuts were plucked by her with the aid of another man.

The 5 coconut trees were at that time 50/80 years of age. The

learned counsel Presidents Counsel for the defendant stressed

that the plaintiff neither gave a name nor called the alleged

coconut plucker to give evidence. Both the plaintiff and the

substituted defendant are ladies. Then, even the defendant

could not have plucked coconuts by herself. But the defendant

also did not call the person or persons who plucked coconuts.

It is in evidence that when Wijayananda Mawatha was

broadened, a part of this land had also been acquired and the

compensation in that regard had successfully been claimed by

the plaintiff and not the defendant. That happened in or around

19802 and the plaintiff filed this action in 1984.

All the extracts of Electoral Registers marked at the trial by the

defendant relates to the house No. 141/2. The Assessment Rate

Receipts are also relevant to 141/1 and 141/2. According to the

Title Deed of the defendant marked V25, the defendant has

become entitled to houses bearing Assessment Nos. 141, 141/1

and 141/2 along Hirimbure Road also known as Olcott

Mawatha. The extracts of Electoral Registers and the

Assessment Rate Receipts refer to Hirimbure Road and not

Wijayananda Mawatha. The reference to Wijayananda Mawatha

in the address of the defendant in the plaint cannot make a

difference.

The plaintiff does not claim houses bearing Assessment Nos.

141/1, 141/2 along Hirimbure Road. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the defendant states that house bearing Assessment

No. 141/2 is in the land in dispute. I am unable to accept it.

This is made clear by looking at Plan P1, which shows the land

claimed by the plaintiff. At the argument, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the defendant did not, with reference to

Plan P1 or any other Plan, specifically point out to the buildings

bearing numbers 141, 141/1 and 141/2, except to make a

general statement that they fall into the land in dispute. It

seems to me that 141/1 and 141/2 buildings lie immediately to

the east of Lot 1 and 2 marked in red in Plan P1, and the

dispute relates not to the main buildings but to the extensions

or new additions made to those buildings by the defendant

thereby encroaching upon the plaintiffs land.

At this point, I must make it clear that, it is not the case of the

defendant that some parts of his land (including 141, 141/1 and

141/2) are shown in Plan P1the land claimed by the plaintiff

as the rightful owner by way of paper title. The defendants

position is that, she has prescribed to some parts of the

plaintiffs land.

I cannot accept the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the defendant that the learned District Judge has not

properly analyzed the evidence led at the trial in the Judgment.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is my view that

the learned District Judge has come to the correct conclusion.

Appeals of both parties are dismissed without costs.
