And Several Others

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Respondents.

Decided on: 15.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application on 07.07.2016 seeking to

quash P17, P18, P19, P20, P28(c) by way of writ of certiorari;

and to compel the Commander of the Army to reinstate him in

the rank of Major with effect from 23.04.2015.

The petitioner did not file several material documents with the

petition or anytime thereafter up to now. P17 is one such

document. Hence this Court cannot obviously quash P17 by

certiorari.

The petitioner was a Major of the Volunteer Force in the Sri

Lanka Army when he was admittedly arrested by the Army

Military Police while transporting some dry rations belonging to

the Sri Lanka Army in his official vehicle on 04.04.2014.

P18 dated 30.06.2015, which the petitioner seeks to quash by

certiorari is, to release the petitioner from active service without

pay from 01.07.2015-30.06.2016. This is permissible under

Regulation 68 of the Army Volunteer Force Regulations marked

1R2.

P19 dated 18.08.2015 is a recommendation by the Commander

of the Army to take disciplinary action against the petitioner on

his plea of guilt.

The petitioner seems to be stating that he did not plead guilty to

the charge. According to the statement which he has made,

found at pages 13-17 in 1R5, he has admitted guilt. He has

signed that statement.

In the petition, the petitioner speaks of a Court of Inquiry

regarding this incident where he was served with a charge sheet

and found guilty. Although those proceedings have been

marked P22 subject to production later, they have not been

produced up to now.

The respondents have tendered the Court of Inquiry proceedings

marked as 1R7. The Charge Sheet to which he has pleaded

guilty, for which he has been reprimanded severely as the

punishment, has been marked as 1R8.

P20 dated 16.09.2015 is to reinstate the petitioner in order to

take disciplinary action and retire him from service.

The petitioner in paragraph 23 of the petition admits that he

decided to retire from Sri Lanka Army (for whatever the

reasons) and tendered retirement papers. His complaint at that

time was refusal to grant unused leave prior to retirement.

Hence the petitioner cannot now, on second thought, challenge

P20 by certiorari or seek to compel the Commander of the Army

by mandamus to reinstate him.

There is nothing to quash by certiorari in P28(c), which is an

administrative requirement, to subject to a medical examination

of an officer who goes on retirement, as seen from P28(a).

The respondents have tendered 1R10-1R17 to show the

petitioners past bad conduct as an officer of the Army where he

has pleaded guilty for various offences and punished.

Writ being a discretionary remedy, this Court is entitled to take

those matters also into account, when granting or refusing relief.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

petitioner but without costs.
