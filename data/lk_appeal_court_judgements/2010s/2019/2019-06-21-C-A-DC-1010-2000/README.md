Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court against the

defendant seeking declaration of title to the land described in

the schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the defendant

therefrom. The defendant in the answer whilst seeking

dismissal of the plaintiffs action, sought a declaration by way of

a cross-claim that he is the owner of a part of the said land

which is morefully described as Lot A3B in Plan No.1049 dated

19.02.1980 (D4). After trial the learned District Judge entered

Judgment for the plaintiffs. Hence this appeal by the defendant.

By admission No.2, the defendant admitted that Dharmadasa

(the late husband of the 1st plaintiff and the father of the 2nd and

3rd plaintiffs) was the owner of the land by virtue of the deed

marked with the plaint P1.

It is the position of the defendant that the said Dharmadasa by

deed No. 9305 dated 13.01.1972 (D13) sold undivided 15

perches to his brother Karunadasa, and Karunadasa in turn by

deed No.3132 dated 03.09.1980 (D2) sold a divided 15 perches

described as Lot A3B in Plan D4 to him.

The learned District Judge held against the defendant

predominantly on the basis that his title deeds marked D2 and

D13 have not been proved despite them being marked subject to

proof.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant strenuously

contends that although those two deeds were marked subject to

proof, when the defendants case was closed reading in evidence

documents marked D1-D15, the counsel for the plaintiffs, as

seen from the proceedings dated 20.04.2000, informed Court

3

that only documents marked D3-D5, D8 and D10 have not been

proved.

It is well settled law that, in a civil case, if an objection has not

been taken at the closure of the case of the opposite party that

the documents marked subject to proof were not proved and

therefore be rejected, they become evidence for all intents and

purposes without the requirement of further proof despite the

subject to proof objection taken at the time of marking the said

documents. Vide the Judgments of the Supreme Court in Sri

Lanka Ports Authority v. Jugolinija Boat East [1981] 1 Sri LR 18,

Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v. Talalle Methananda Thero [1997]

2 Sri LR 101, Stassen Exports Limited v. Brooke Bond Group Ltd

[2010] 2 Sri LR 36, Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef v. Abdul Majeed

Mohamed Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333. This includes deeds

marked subject to proof. Vide the Supreme Court Judgment in

Samarakoon v. Gunasekera [2011] 1 Sri LR 149.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

plaintiffs that the proceedings dated 20.04.2000 have been

wrongly recorded is unacceptable because after the said date,

case has been called in open Court as much as seven times

before the Judgment was delivered. Even in the plaintiffs

written submissions tendered to the District Court dated

29.09.2000, although it has been stated that the said two deeds

have not been proved, it has not been stated that the

proceedings dated 20.04.2000 have been wrongly recorded. In

any event, the recording of the proceedings of the lower Court

cannot for the first time be challenged in the Appellate Court.

4

The learned District Judge has not taken this vital matter into

consideration when pronouncing the Judgment, and therefore

the said Judgment cannot be allowed to stand.

Let the District Judge enter Judgment for the plaintiffs as

prayed for in paragraph (a) of the prayer to the plaint subject to

the grant of the relief to the defendant as prayed for in

paragraph (b) of the prayer to the answer.

Appeal is allowed without costs.
