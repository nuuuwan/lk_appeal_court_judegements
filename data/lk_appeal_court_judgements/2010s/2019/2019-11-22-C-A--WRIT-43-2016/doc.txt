Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Thishya Weragoda with Buddhika Illangatillake

for the Petitioner.

Chaya Sri Nammuni, S.S.C., for the 1st

Respondent.

Decided on: 22.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner company filed this application against the

Consumer Affairs Authority of Sri Lanka, seeking to quash by

way of writ of certiorari, the decision of the said Authority

contained in A13(a) and A13(b) whereby the petitioner was

directed to pay a sum of Rs.703,794/= to the consumer, who

was made the 2nd respondent to this application; and to prevent

the Authority by way of writ of prohibition from implementing

the said decision.

The complaint of the consumer to the Consumer Affairs

Authority was that, the vehicle which she purchased from the

petitioner was defective.

The Consumer Affairs Authority filed objections to this

application.

The petitioner challenges this decision of the Consumer Affairs

Authority on several grounds. One of them is that the inquiry

panel which held the inquiry into the complaint of the consumer

3

was not properly constituted, and therefore, the impugned order

made by the said panel is a nullity.

In terms of section 3(4) read with item 8(2) of the Schedule to

the Consumer Affairs Act, No.9 of 2003, The quorum for any

meeting of the Authority shall be four members.

It is undisputed that upon the complaint of the consumer, the

preliminary inquiry was held on 28.03.2013, and thereafter, the

formal inquiry in terms of section 13(1) of the Act was held on

09.07.2013, at which the matter was settled between the

petitioner and the consumer, whereby the consumer agreed to

accept a sum of Rs.703,794/= from the petitioner in return of

the vehicle, which the consumer says is defective.

This settlement did not materialise and each party points the

finger at the opposite party for the failure to implement it.

It is thereafter, the Consumer Affairs Authority sent the

impugned order to the petitioner, which is admittedly based on

the said settlement arrived at the formal inquiry held on

09.07.2013. This is made clear inter alia by paragraph 35 of the

statement of objections of the Consumer Affairs Authority where

it is stated that the Respondent Authority had concluded the

inquiry at which a settlement was arrived at and the final order

reflects the settlement entered into.

According to the inquiry notes produced marked A11, the panel

of inquiry had consisted of only three members. The Consumer

Affairs Authority in paragraph 26 of the statement of objections

whilst admitting it, has further stated that, when the settlement

4

was later converted into an order by A13(b) in terms of section

13(4) of the Act, all four members of the panel has signed it.

The said paragraph 26 reads as follows:

Answering the averments contained in paragraph 32 of the

petition the respondent states that one of the members of

the panel of inquiry had stepped out and was not present

when the settlement was entered into on 9.7.2013.

Nevertheless, since there was no analysis of the evidence

required and since it was the settlement entered into by the

parties that was converted into an order as per the

provisions of section 13(4) of the Act, all four members of

the panel had signed the order marked A13(b).

That means, there was no quorum for a proper meeting of the

Authority, when the settlement, which is the essence of the

inquiry, and which was later converted into a formal order, was

reached.

As I stated earlier The quorum for any meeting of the Authority

shall be four members, and signing the formal order after

several months of the inquiry by four members will not validate

an otherwise invalid meeting due to lack of quorum. In this case

the inquiry was held on 09.07.2013 and the order was made on

29.05.2014. According to the inquiry notes, the inquiry has

been held before three members, and the order has been signed

by those three members of the inquiry panel and another

member of the Authority. It is clear that there was no quorum

to hold a proper inquiry in order to make a legally enforceable

order based on the settlement arrived at in that inquiry.

In Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority of Sri

Lanka [2007] 2 Sri LR 212 at 215, in a similar situation,

Sripavan J. (later C.J.) held that:

In the absence of a quorum for the meeting of the members

of the 1st respondent Authority, I hold that the decision

contained in the document marked P108 is devoid of any

legal effect. Accordingly, a Writ of Certiorari is issued

quashing the said document marked P108.

As this Court is satisfied with that argument raised by the

learned counsel for the petitioner, there is no necessity to delve

into the other arguments taken up by the learned counsel

seeking to quash the impugned decision.

For the aforesaid reasons, I quash the impugned orders of the

Consumer Affairs Authority marked A13(a) and A13(b) by

certiorari and allow the application of the petitioner but without

costs.
