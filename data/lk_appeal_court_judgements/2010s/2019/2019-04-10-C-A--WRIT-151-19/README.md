Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the selection criteria annexed to the petition

marked 'Pll" -'

, 1

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the selection of the national contingent for

the Junior Federation Cup Tennis Tournament that is scheduled to be held

in Thailand from 15th _18th April 2019;

c) A Writ of Mandamus to formulate a transparent and acceptable selection

criteria for the selections that are to be made by the Sri Lanka Tennis

Association;

d) An interim order suspending any further selections for the National

contingent for the Junior Federation Cup Tennis Tournament that is

scheduled to be held from 15th - 18th April 2019

e) An interim order restraining the ih - 14th Respondents from any further

selections for the National contingent for the Junior Federation Cup

Tennis Tournament that is scheduled to be held from 15th - 18th April

2019, based on the purported selection criteria marked 'Pll'.

This Court must observe at the outset that although the Petitioners' have

claimed that, 'to date the said trials for Junior Fed Cup has not been conducted

4

by the Respondents'\ the trials to select a girls team to participate at the

Junior Federation Cup Tennis Tournament that is scheduled to be held in

Thailand from 15th -18th April 2019 (the said Tournament) have been

conducted and concluded prior to 25th February 2019 by the Sri Lanka Tennis

Association, as borne out by the document marked 'P14,.2 In fact, the

submissions that were made by all Counsel were on the basis that trials had

been conducted and concluded without the participation of the 2nd Petitioner.

Although the Petitioner has not provided this Court with the results of the said

trials, this Court has been informed that the 1 i h Respondent won all her

matches against the other competitors during the said trials. 'P14' confirms

that the Selection Committee has already submitted the "team's nomination to

the Ministry of Sports based on results of the trials concluded". The learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st and 2nd Respondents informed this

Court while this application was being supported that the said selection has

been confirmed by the Minister of Sports, as required by Section 40 of the

Sports Law No. 25 of 1973, as amended.3 The question of making 'any further

selections' does not therefore arise and in these circumstances, the necessity

for this Court to consider the interim orders prayed for does not arise.

The only issue that remains for the consideration of this Court is whether

notices should be issued on the Respondents in terms of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990.

I Paragraph 15 of the petition. This has been repeated in paragraph 7 of 'P9', which is a letter dated 2'3,d March 2019 is sent on behalf of the Petitioners to the l 't Respondent.

2 'P14' is an email sent by the 10th Respondent to the father of the 1 ih Respondent.

3 Section 40 reads as follows : "The Minister may regulate and control, by regulation, the participation in sports either in Sri Lanka or abroad, of individual participants or teams of players purporting to represent Sri Lanka ." The decision of the Minister nullifies the decision in 'P13' to reject the selection of the 1 ih Respondent.

5

This Court must also observe that e~cept the Writ of Mandamus in paragraph

c(i) of the prayer to the petition, the rest of the relief has been sought against

the National Selection Committee for Tennis and/or the Selection Committee

of the Sri Lanka Tenn'is Association, Although the Sri Lanka Tennis Association is

the National body for tennis in Sri Lanka and has been registered in terms of

the SRorts Law, it does not appear that the Petitioners have established a link

between th~ purported actions and/or inactions on the part of the 3rd - 14th

Respondents and any provision of the Sports Law or the regulations made

thereunder. However, this Court shall not consider at this stage whether this

Court has the jurisdiction to consider the reliefs prayed for against the 3rd -

14th Respondents as this matter was not addressed by the learned Counsel

during the course of their submissions.

The dispute that gives rise to this application is the alleged failure by the ih -

14th Respondents to permit the 2nd Petitioner to participate at the trials that

were conducted to select the girls team to represent Sri Lanka at the

aforementioned Tournament, with the 1st Petitioner claiming that the said

failure is unreasonable and malicious.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner is the father of the 2nd Petitioner, who has participated and

won many Doubles events at local and international Tennis tournaments. Byan

email dated 11th February 2019 annexed to the petition marked 'P4', one

Zareena Saleem had requested the 1st Petitioner and several others to inform,

on or before 13th February 2019, the availability of their daughters to play trials

6

from 18th February 2019 onwards in order to select the team that is to

participate at the said Tournament.

The 1st Petitioner, by an email sent on 1ih February 2019 annexed to the

petition marked 'PS', informed the 10th Respondent who is also the Chairman

of the Selection Committee of the Sri Lanka Tennis Association that he is

objecting to trials being called at short notice as the 2nd Petitioner was

participating lin the Clay Court tournament conducted by the Sinhalese Sports

Club and that requesting players to adapt to 'hard' courts within 2-3 days is

unacceptable. This Court must observe at this stage that the Petitioners have

not disclosed the days on which the SSC Tournament was due to conclude or

the days on which the 2nd Petitioner was to take part. The 1st Petitioner had

stated further that the 2nd Petitioner "is also in the under 20 National Netball

pool and the final trials are during this period. They have morning and evening

training and trial matches start on 1 ihll.

By an email dated 13th February 2019 annexed to the petition marked 'P6', the

10th Respondent had responded to 'PS', explaining as follows:

"Sri Lanka junior tennis teams are taking part in international team

competitions from early March onwards and we therefore scheduled

trials for Junior Davis Cup (completed), World Junior Boys (will be

completed tomorrow), World Junior Girls (started on 11 Feb to be

completed by Feb 17) and now Junior Fed Cup (from 18 Feb onwards

subject to Court availability ... "

7

This is the reason given by the 10th Respondent for the trials to be scheduled

from 18th February 2019 onwards, as well as why the trials cannot be held in

the first week of March, as proposed by the 1st Petitioner. The most important

point made in 'P6', especially as the team was to take part in an international

team event, is that the above scheduling of dates was done as "the Team

captain and coach must have sufficient time to prepare the team for the

respective competition".

The 1st Petitioner, who had replied 'P6' by his email dated 14th February 2019,

annexed to the petition marked 'P7' had raised issue with players who have

not played a tournament in Sri Lanka being permitted to participate in the

trials as opposed to the 2nd Petitioner who had not only taken part in many

tournaments held in Sri Lanka but won several of them. However, the issue

that the 1st Petitioner was required to address at that stage was not whether

others could take part in the trials but importantly, whether the 2nd Petitioner

was agreeable to take part in the trials. In this regard, this Court observes that

the 1st Petitioner had reiterated in 'P7' that the 2nd Petitioner is due to take

part in National netball trials during the period that the tennis trials were

proposed to be held.

This Court will now consider whether the decision of the 10th Respondent in

'P6' to schedule the trials for a date after February 18 and, the refusal to

postpone the trials, is unreasonable. This Court must observe that all parties

are in agreement that trials had to be conducted in order to select the team.4

Thus, non participation at the trials, for whatever reason results in the

particular player being disqualified from being considered for selection.

4 The 16

th Respondent, who is the current Girls Under 16 National Champion and with an International Tennis Federation ra nking in the top lOOO,has been given direct entry to the team.

8

Although the 1st Petitioner sought a postponement of the trials on account of it

being difficult to adapt from one surface to another without sufficient time,

this Court observes that this issue may have applied to the other players, as

well. Thus, this Court does not consider that to be a sufficient reason to

postpone the trials. What is significant however is that the request for a

postponement of the trials seems to have been more connected to the 2nd

Petitioner being part of the National Netball Pool and practices taking f3lae in

the same period that the said trials were to take place.s A postponement of the

trials on this account would have been unfair by the other participants. This

Court has examined the reasons given in 'P6', referred to earlier, as to why the

trials were scheduled from 18th February 2019 onwards and why the trials

could not be postponed to early March 2019 as proposed by the 1st Petitioner

and is of the view that the said reasons cannot be considered as being

unreasonable or irrational.

In terms of Section 30 of the Sports Law, "any person who is aggrieved by any

decision or action of a registered National Association of Sports may, in

accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Law, appeal to the Minister

against such decision or action and the Minister's decision on such appeal shall

be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court of law." The 1st

Petitioner states that by a letter dated 22nd February 2019 annexed to the

petition marked 'PS', he made a complaint to the 2nd Respondent, the

Secretary, Ministry of Sports primarily with regard to permission being granted

to the 1 ih Respondent to take part in the trials

6 as well as the refusal by the

10th Respondent to postpone the trials. The learned Senior Deputy So~icitor

5 Paragraph 4(d) of 'P9' reads as follows: "Ms, Seneviratne being in the Under 20 National Netball pool has two training sessions per day and trial matches to be started by 1 i

h February 2019 .. ,"

6 Paragraph 9 of the letter 'P9',

9

General informed this Court that no action was taken on this letter as the 2nd

Respondent does not have the power to inquire into the matters set out

therein. However, this Court observes from the letter dated 2ih March 2019

annexed to the petition marked 'P13' issued by the Director General of Sports

to the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Tennis Association that a complaint of the 1st

Petitioner has been inquired into and a decision has been taken inter alia that

players who ldo nOltake- part~ in trrals-sho-uld not be permitted to take part in

the said tournament. 7 This decision, which has not been challenged in these

proceedings, means that the 2nd Petitioner cannot be in contention for

selection to represent Sri Lanka at the said Tournament.

Be that as it may, the Petitioners, acting through their Attorneys-at-Law have

filed an appeal marked 'pg' with the Minister of Sports in terms of Section 30

of the Sports Law. The appeal relating to the non-selecti~n of the 2nd

Petitioner now stands decided in view of the submission of the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General that the 1st Respondent has confirmed the selection

of the team that is to participate at the said Tournament.

This Court observes that even though general issues relating to selection far

wider than the non-selection of the 2nd Petitioner has been raised by the 1st

Petitioner in 'pg', there does not appear to have been an adjudication of these

matters by the 1st Respondent. This Court observes further that in terms of

Regulation 7(vi) of the National Association of Sports Regulations No. 1 of

2016, annexed to the petition marked 'P12',8 it is the duty of the Sri Lanka

Tennis Association to formulate a transparent selection criteria to select teams

7 The selection of the 1 ih Respondent had also been quashed by this letter. However, as informed by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General, the Minister of Sports has permitted the 1 ih Respondent to take part in the said Tournament, thereby over-ruling that part of 'P13' .. a Published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1990/23 dated 2ih October 2016.

to represent the country in international or regional sports events in

coordination inter alia with the Director General of Sports. This Court also

notes that conflicting submissions have been made with regard to the

authenticity of the Selection Criteria annexed to the petition marked 'P10' and

'Pll'. Taking into consideration all of the above, this Court is of the view that

the 1st Respondent must consider the general issues relating to selection raised

by the 1st Petitioner- il'l 2.P9~ tl'l- tne eon-tex-t of the Se.ectiol'l eriteria that has now

been proposed by the Sri Lanka Tennis Association and, where necessary

discuss with the relevant stakeholders and issue directions in terms of the law

to ensure that selections to represent Sri Lanka are carried out in a transparent

and fair manner.

In the said circumstances and subject to the above, this Court does not see any

legal basis to issue notices to the Respondents. The application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
