The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya for

kidnapping and rape punishable under section 357 and section 364 (1)

of the Penal Code. After trial he was convicted on both charges. He was

sentenced to four years RI with a fine of Rs. 10,000/= with a default

sentence of two years for the first charge. For the second charge he was

sentenced to twelve years RI and he was also ordered to pay a fine of

Rs. 10,000/= running a default term of two years. In addition to the above

sentences he was ordered to pay Rs. 1,00,000/= as compensation to the

victim with a default sentence of two years.

The evidence of the prosecution was that on the day of the incident

the prosecutrix who lived with her mother in a small hut heard a noise out

side and has gone out to investigate. She was dragged into a nearby

compound. Her mother who tried to raise cries was threatened. She has

identified the person who dragged her and raped her as the fish monger

from the next village. She was raped by the said person whom she had

said she identified while been dragged and raped. The appellant has

threatened her and told her not to tell anyone. She has waited till down

and gone home. She has found the mother hiding inside the house. She

has gone to the police station with a relation called Chandani and made

2

a complaint. She has identifLed- ttle-aplleUanLb-name as well whe~

making the complaint.

The medical evidence has gone unchallenged at the trial and

according to the medical evidence the victim had injuries on her body and

rape was not ruled out. The doctor has said she has been raped.

The appellant making a dock statement has denied the incident

and has said he attended the wedding of one of his friends namely Cyril

on that night. The two friends who gave evidence on behalf of the

appellant have said they all attended the wedding of the daughter of

Thillake.

The points of argument taken up by the learned counsel for the

appellant were that the appellant was not properly identified by the victim.

The prosecutrix while giving evidence has said the appellant came to their

road to sell fish and that she knew him by name. He argued that it could

have been a case of mistaken identity but the defence did not put this to

the victim in the High Court. The defence has not suggested in the High

Court that the appellant was not properly identified by the prosecution.

Therefore we find that the learned High Court Judge has carefully

3

analysed the evidence an~me to the corre-.eUtnding on the issue of

identification.

In Sigera vs Attorney General 2011 vol. 1 page 201 it was held;

"To apply Turnbul principles the identification had to be

made under difficult circumstances. In this case, although

the incident took place during night, there was ample light

shed by the bulb of the lamp post that was burning. There

was no congregation of a multitude of persons in a crowd

but only the Accused Appellant and the deceased. in order

to inflict the injuries on the deceased, the assailant had to

come very close to the deceased. The injuries could not have

been caused from a distance. According to the Government

Analyst the shooting had taken place from a short distance.

In fact it had to be done at close quarters and the distance

couldn't have been more than an arm's-length. A bulb was

lit and the Appellant was a well known person who lived in

the neighborhood, in the same vicinity for a long time. These

uncontroverted facts prove that there was ample light and

ample time for the deceased to identify the Appellant."

The otl:le41oinLoLargllmenltakeILnyJhaappell~COllun .. s=e'-LI __

was that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the

evidence of the defence in the High Court and the defence of alibi.

On perusal of the learned High Court Judge's judgment we

find that the learned High Court Judge has analysed the defence

evidence when arriving at his finding.

For the afore stated reasons we decide that this court is not

inclined to set aside a well considered judgment. Judgment and

conviction dated 05/12/2016 is affirmed and the appeal is

dismissed.
