01. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted with the 2nd Accused in

the High Court of Vavuniya on one count of abduction punishable under

section 355 of the Penal Code, and on one count of murder punishable

under section 296 of the Penal Code. After the conclusion of the case for

the prosecution, the learned High Court Judge acting under section 200 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act acquitted the 2nd Accused of both

counts. After conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge

convicted the Appellant on count No.1 and sentenced him for 10 years

rigorous imprisonment. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the

sentence the Appellant preferred the instant appeal.

2

Grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant are;

1. That the learned Trial Judge erred in law when concluding that

the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

2. That the learned Trial Judge failed to analyze the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses.

3. That the learned Trial Judge based his judgment purely on

speculations and surmises.

4. The learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the defence case

properly and rejected the defence evidence in the wrong

premise.

02. All four grounds of appeal can be considered together as they are based

on the same footing, that the evidence has not been evaluated properly by

the learned Trial Judge.

03. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that it is unsafe to convict the

Appellant on the testimony of the PW3 who is not a credible witness.

04. Prosecution mainly relied upon the evidence of the sole eye witness

called by the prosecution Gunarasa Nagarani (PW3) who is the wife of

the deceased victim. Her evidence was that her husband (victim) was

taken away by those who came from the EPDP office. She identified the

Appellant and the 2nd Accused as the persons who took the husband. She

3

had not seen them before. After 12 days of taking her husband away, his

body was found and she had identified the body as of her husband's at the

hospital.

05. She had identified the Accused persons at the identification parade held

in the Magistrate's Court. Her sister in law had told her the same day that

the name of the person who abducted her husband is Kumar. However, in

cross examination it was revealed that in her statement to the police made

after 12 days of the alleged abduction, she had told the police that

unidentified persons abducted her husband in the night of February. That

was after the body of the deceased was recovered. Although she learnt the

name of the suspect as Kumar from her sister in law, she had failed to

give his name to the police. Although she had told the police that her

husband was abducted in February, according to the charge the date of

abduction is 8th March 2009. If she knew that the name of the person who

abducted her husband was Kumar, she could have given the name to the

police. The best witness to testify on the identity of the Accused would

have been her sister in law who knew the Appellant before. Prosecution

has failed to call her to give evidence.

06. In cross examination, PW3 again said that when she went to the

Chettikulam EPDP camp, the Officer in charge told her that it was Kumar

who abducted her husband. She had told in her evidence at the inquest

that she could identify the person and that he is in the Chettikulam camp.

She had further said that he was fat and not much hair on the head. Then

again in re-examination she had said that it was not Kumar she referred to

as the person who was fat and without hair on the head, but the Officer in

charge of the camp.

4

07. On the above contradictions per se and inter se in the testimony of the

PW3, her evidence on the identity ofthe Appellant cannot be relied upon.

08. In case of Sumanasena V. Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri L.R. 137 it

was held that evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence

of a single solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon

by a Court of law.

09. In case of Wijepala V. Attorney General SC Appeal 104/99, 3,d October

2000 Court said;

The evidence of a single witness, if cogent and

impressive, can be acted upon by a Court, but, whenever there are

circumstances of suspicion in the testimony of such a witness or is

challenged by the cross examination or otherwise, then

corroboration may be necessary. The established rule of practice

in such circumstances is to look for corroboration in material

particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial .... '

lO. The above-mentioned discrepancies in her evidence go to the root of the

case and affect the credibility ofPW3. On the identity of the Appellant as

the person who abducted the deceased, there is no other evidence either

direct or circumstantial adduced by the prosecution. Medical evidence on

the autopsy conducted on the body of the deceased and the evidence of

the Police Officer who investigated into the matter after the body of the

deceased was found are not of any assistance to the identity of the

Appellant as the offender or the person who abducted the deceased.

Hence, it is unsafe to convict the Appellant on the sole testimony ofPW3

5

who is incredible. I find that the grounds of appeal have merit and the

appeal should be allowed.

Hence, conviction ofthe Appellant by the learned High Court Judge is set

aside. Appellant is acquitted of count No.1.

Appeal allowed.
