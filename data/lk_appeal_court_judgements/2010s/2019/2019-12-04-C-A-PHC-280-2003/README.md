Decided on: 03.12.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The appellant filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of

the High Court dated 28.10.2003, which affirmed the order of

the Magistrates Court dated 15.03.2001 marked P8.

P8 order was made by the Magistrates Court upon an

application made under section 8(1) of the Agrarian

Development Act, No. 46 of 2000, by the Commissioner of

Agrarian Development, seeking an eviction order of the appellant

from the paddyland in question, due to non-compliance with the

orders made by the Commissioner marked P6 and P7.

P6 order relates to the rent (the number of bushels of paddy)

payable by the appellant as the tenant cultivator to the 2nd

respondent being the landlord. This order was made against the

appellant after an inquiry.

As the P6 order was not complied with, the Commissioner sent

P7 to the appellant informing him of the termination of the

tenant cultivatorship and directing him to handover possession

of the paddyland within 30 days thereof to the landlord. The

appellant refused to comply with P7 order as well.

It is against this backdrop the Commissioner sought an order

from the Magistrates Court under section 8(1) of the said Act to

evict the appellant from the paddyland.

Section 8(1) of the Act reads as follows:

Where any person who has been ordered under this Act, by

the Commissioner-General to vacate any extent of

agricultural land, fails to comply with such order, the

Commissioner-General or any other person authorised in

that behalf by the Commissioner-General may present to

the Magistrates Court within whose local jurisdiction such

extent wholly or mainly lies, a written report,

(a) setting out the nature of such order and the

person to whom it was issued, describing the

extent of land to which such order relates;

(b) stating that the person who has been ordered to

vacate has failed to so vacate such extent of land;

and

(c) praying for an order to evict such person and all

other persons in occupation of such extent of land

from such extent, and stating the name of the

person to whom delivery of possession of such

extent should be made.

Section 8(2) reads as follows:

Where a written report is presented to a Magistrates Court

under subsection (1), such court shall direct the Fiscal or

peace officer to forthwith evict the person specified in such

report and all other persons in occupation of the extent of

agricultural land specified in the order and to deliver

possession of such extent to the person mentioned in such

report as the person to whom delivery of possession of such

extent should be made.

P8 order, which is being challenged in this appeal, is a

ministerial order that the Magistrates Court is required to make

under the Act. When a written report is filed in the Magistrates

Court under section 8(1) of the Act, there is no necessity for the

Court to issue Notice on the defaulter to show cause or

otherwise. If the report has been filed in compliance with the

requirements of section 8(1), the Magistrate has no option but to

make the order sought for.

The appellant should have challenged not the order marked P8,

but the orders marked P6 and P7, which preceded it, by

invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court. This has not been

done.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
