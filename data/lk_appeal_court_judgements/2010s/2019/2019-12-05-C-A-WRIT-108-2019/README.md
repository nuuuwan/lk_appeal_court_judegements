Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner and the

Respondents on 31st July 2019

Decided on: 2nd December 2019

Arjuna Obeyesekere. J

The Petitioner states that he was a building contractor and was engaged in the

construction of irrigation canals, roads, buildings etc. He states further that his

business was registered with the Department of Inland Revenue (the Revenue)

for the payment of Value Added Tax (VAT). The Petitioner admits that he had

delayed the filing of the VAT returns and that as a result, the Revenue had

disallowed the claims he had made for VAT refunds. The Revenue had served

the Petitioner a Certificate of Tax in default dated 16

th September 2009 in

terms of Section 43(1) of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002, as amended,

in a sum of Rs. 11,137,283. On an appeal filed by the Petitioner, the penalty on

the sum due had been waived and the sum in default had been reduced to Rs.

6,405,616. The Revenue has filed Case No. 71585 against the Petitioner in the

District Court of Colombo in the year 2009 seeking to recover the aforesaid

sum of Rs. 6,405,616.

The Petitioner states that he faced many difficulties while carrying out several

projects in 2009 in the district of Mannar, and that he was discriminated at the

hands of a particular Public servant on the basis of his ethnicity. As a result, the

payments due to the Petitioner for work which had already been carried out

had been delayed, which the Petitioner claims affected his cash flow and

ultimately disrupted the smooth functioning of his business. The Petitioner

states that he was compelled to sell two motor vehicles belonging to him and

obtain an overdraft facility from the Bank of Ceylon to tide over his financial

problems.

In the above circumstances, the Petitioner had made an application to the

Revenue in terms of Section 21 of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.9

of 2011. Section 21 reads as follows:

"Any person or portnership supplying any goods or services having an

annual turnover of a sum not exceeding rupees one hundred millian who

has defaulted in the payment af taxes payable by him under this Act in

respect af any taxable period ending on or before December 31, 2010, due

to the existence generally of any conflict environment or due to any

financial constraints of such person or partnership, shall be exempt from

the payment of such charge as is in default under this Act:

Provided that, the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue shall on a

request made to him in that behalf, issue to such person or partnership a

Certificate of Exemption in respect of the sum as in default:

Provided further, the person or partnership to whom the Certificate of

Exemption is issued, shall simultaneously forward to the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue a written assurance to the effect that such

person or partnership shall be responsible for the payment of all sums

which may become payable by him under this Act, in respect of any future

taxable period commencing on or after January 1,2011."

This Court has examined the said application dated 9th September 2011

annexed to the petition marked 'P9a' submitted by the Petitioner to the

Revenue and observes that even though the Petitioner had explained therein

the financial difficulties faced by him, no documents had been annexed to the

said application in support of the facts contained therein. By a letter dated 11th

June 2012, annexed to the petition marked 'P14', the 2nd Respondent, who was

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue at that time, had informed the

Petitioner that an exemption cannot be granted in terms of the

aforementioned provision of the Act, as the Petitioner has failed to

substantiate the financial difficulties faced by him.

1 The Petitioner had

appealed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue against the said

decision by letter dated 27th June 2002, but his appeals had been rejected by

the 2nd Respondent by her letters dated 2nd August 2012 and 4th June 2013,

annexed to the petition marked 'P16' and 'P17', respectively.

Dissatisfied by the said decision, the Petitioner has filed this application on 14th

March 2019 seeking to quash the said decisions contained in 'P16' and 'P17',

as well as a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Revenue to grant an exemption

to the Petitioner in terms of the provisions of the above Act.

At the time this matter was supported, the learned Senior State Counsel for

the Respondents raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner is guilty of

inordinate delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. The said objection

relates to the maintainability of this application and hence, this Court is of the

view that it should consider the said objection at the outset.

The Superior Courts of this country have consistently held that a petitioner

seeking a discretionary remedy s'Jch as a Writ of Certiorari must do so without

delay, and where a petitioner i:.; guilty of delay, such delay must be explained

to the satisfaction of Court. In other words, unexplained delay acts as a bar in

obtaining relief in discretionary remedies, such as Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus. While this Court expects parties to seek relief from Court as soon

as it may reasonably be possible, a delay, if any should be due to reasons

beyond the control of the party seeking relief. A party cannot 'sit' on his

entitlement to seek relief and thereafter belatedly make an application to

Court seeking relief, the granting of which is at the discretion of Court.

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis2 Sharvananda, J (as he then was) set out the

rationale for the above proposition, in the following manner:

"A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be

held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise

of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well accepted principles.

The Court is bound to issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by

the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled

himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like

submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver. ..... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury

is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay

defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a Writ

application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay ...... An application for a Writ of Certiorari

should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which

the applicant seeks to have quashed."

Sharvananda J. went on to consider if an application for a writ should be

dismissed on account of delay where the act complained of is an illegality, and

held as follows:

"When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court

would be loathe to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject

' 1982 1 Sri LR 368; at pages 377 to 379. This case has been followed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon Petroleum Corporation v. Kaluarachchi and others ISC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19

,

the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very

extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority

concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court

may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows

that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction."

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another3, the Supreme Court,

adverting to the question of long delay, held as follows:

"If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law

both to punish his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus

subveniunt,4 and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing and othersS

Bandaranayake J, dealing with a belated application for a Writ of Certiorari

held as follows:

"It is however to be noted that delay could defeat equity. Although there is

no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limits in filing an

application for judicial review and the case law of this country is indicative

of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding 'a good and valid

reason' for allowing late applications, I am of the view that there should

be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such belated

' .

applicatians. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic characteristic

of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay in applying for

the remedy".

The above judgments clearly illustrate four important matters, although not

necessarily in a particular order. The first is that an application for a Writ must

be filed without delay. The second is that where there is, on the face of the

application, a delay, such delay must be explained to the satisfaction of Court.

The third is that delay can be ignored, if the act complained of is manifestly

illegal, such as a decision of a statutory authority made in excess of jurisdiction.

The fourth is the nature of the acts that have taken place during the time

period between the impugned decision or act and the filing of the application.

These factors are relevant when determining whether an application should be

dismissed on account of the Petitioner being guilty of delay.

This Court will now consider the facts of this application, keeping in mind the

above dicta.

As observed earlier, while 'P14' was issued on 11th June 2012 and 'P16' and

'P17' have been issued on 2nd August 2012 and 4th June 2013 respectively, this

application had been filed only on 19th March 2019. Thus, there is considerable

delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court as this application has been filed

almost six years after the appeal had been rejected. This Court has examined

the petition and observes that the Petitioner has not offered any explanation

for the delay in filing of this application. Furthermore, the Petitioner is not

alleging that the decision of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is

illegal, or ultra vires the powers of the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, and that delay should therefore not be considered. In the above

circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel that the Petitioner is guilty of delay and that this

application is liable to be dismissed in limine on the ground of laches. The

necessity for this Court to consider the grievance of the Petitioner, namely that

the decision of the 2nd Respondent in unreasonable, therefore does not arise,

suffice it to state that in the absence of material in support of the Petitioner's

appeal to the Commissioner General, it cannot be said that the rejection of the

Petitioner's appeal by the Commissioner General is unreasonable.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
