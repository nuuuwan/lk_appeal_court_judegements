The Applicant-P.~titioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Uva

Province holden in Monaragala dated 20.06.2013 in Case No. 0212012 Rev and

seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of

Wellawaya dated 08.12.2011 in Case No. 62804. At the stage of argument, both

parties agreed to dispose this case by way of written submissions and to abide by

the same.

Facts of the case:

A lorry bearing Registration No. UPLK-5686, with its driver, was arrested by

Police, Wellawaya on or about 29.01.2011 for transporting Halmilla timber

without a valid permit. The accused-driver was charged before the Learned

magistrate of Wellawaya for the alleged offence punishable under section 25(2)

read with sections 25 (2)(a), 38(a), 40 and 40A of the Forest Ordinance as

amended. On 01.02.2011, the driver pleaded guilty to the charge leveled against

Page 3 of 10

him and accordingly the Learned Magistrate Vnposed a fine of Rs.20, 000/= with a

default sentence of 4 months rigorous imprisonment. ,

Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the Lorry bearing registration

no. UP LK 5686. The applicant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"appellant") being the registered owner of the said vehicle, claimed the vehicle in

said inquiry. Accordingly the appellant testified in the inquiry.

After concluding the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by

order dated 08.12.2011.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant moved in reVISIOn to the

Provincial High Court of Uva Province holden in Monaragala. The Learned High

Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate and dismissed the

application of the appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The Learned Magistrate failed to observe that the appellant has established

that he has taken all precaution to prevent any offence being committed

utilizing his vehicle.

2. The judgment of the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate

, of Wellawaya are erroneous.

3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the Learned

Magistrate's conclusion on the Appellant ought to have called further

corroborative evidence is contrary to section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 4 of 10

4. The Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge should have been mindful of the fact that both of them were considering a fact directly linked

, with the property right of a citizen.

At the inquiry held, the appellant in his evidence stated that the vehicle was given

to the accused-driver on rent. The driver used to take the lorry every morning and

return in the evening. It was further testified that this was the 1 st instance the driver

was found guilty of such offence and the service of the driver was tenninated after

this incident.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant contended that the degree of

proof cast on a 3rd party applicant in tenns of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance is

on a balance of probability and no court of law requires him to satisfy the judge

beyond reasonab.le doubt that he had taken all the precautions to prevent the crime.

It was further contended that the test that should be applied is from the point of

view of an ordinary reasonable man i.e. whether the owner took precautions that an

ordinary reasonable man found in similar circumstances will take.

Accordingly the Learned President's Counsel submitted that in the present case the

appellant has given evidence and explained the precautions he took as follows;

1. Cautioning the driver and giving necessary directives.

2. Has directed to infonn ifhe going outside the city limits

3. Ensuring that each evening that the vehicle was returned home.

However I observe that nowhere in his evidence, the appellant had stated that he

ensured the vehicle was returned home each evening. The appellant had simply

stated that the driver used to take the vehicle in the morning and return in the

evening. The appellant had further testified that he instructed the driver to infonn

Page 5 of 10

him if the driver goes out of Wellawaya town and instructed to refrain from doing

any illegal activity. The appellant took up the position that the offence had been

committed without his knowledge.

In the case of W. Jalathge Surasena V. O.I.C, Hikkaduwa and 3 others lCA

(PHC) APN 100/2014], it was held that,

" ... A mere denial by the of Registered Owner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge, of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle

laid down in the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of a vehicle

which had been used for a commission of an offence for an unauthorized

" purpose ...

In the case of K.W.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura .. and another lCA (PHC) 89/2013], it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance,

making use of that vehicle ... Nothing is forthcoming to show that he has

taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being committed by

using this vehicle t~ough he was the person who had the power to exercise

control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore, it is evident that

no meaningful step had been taken either by the owner or his power of

attorney holder, of the vehicle that was confiscated in order to prevent an

offence being committed by making use of this vehicle. "

Page 6 of 10

It is noteworthy that the procedure relevant to confiscating a vehicle under Forest

Ordinance was amended by Act No.65 of 2009. Accordingly section 40

specifically requires a vehicle owner to prove that he in fact took all precautions to

prevent an offence being committed utilizing his vehicle. I observe that the law

pertaining to confiscating a vehicle under Forest Ordinance had been correctly

applied by the Learned Magistrate. The Learned Magistrate has held as follows;

However in the petition submitted to the High Court, it was contended that the

Learned Magistrate erred in applying the Act No. 65 of 2009 to the instant case

because the said Act was not mentioned in the charges forwarded by the Police.

This contention was correctly addressed by the Learned High Court Judge (page

32 & 33 of the brief). I observe that the offence was committed in 2011 and the

Act was certified on 16.11.2009 while it was published in Gazette on 20.11.2009.

Therefore the procedure laid down in the said Act was clearly applicable to the

instant case and the Learned Magistrate was correct in applying the same.

The Learned SSC for the respondent contended that the registered owner has

simply told the driver not to use the vehicle for illegal purposes and merely giving

instructions is not sufficient to prove that the appellant has taken all necessary

precautions. The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that it is

Page 7 of 10

not rational to expect the owner to go with the driver on every Journey or

reasonable to expect the owner to conduct a surprise check to ascertain whether the

driver complies 'with his directives. The case of Abubackerge Jaleel V. OIC,

Anti-Vice unit, Police Station, Anuradapura rCA (PHC) 108/2010] was

submitted to support said contention, in which it was held that,

"When someone is under a duty to show cause that he has taken all

precautions against the commission of similar offences, I do not think that

he can practically do many things than to give specific instruction. The

owner of the lorry cannot be seated all the time in the lorry to closely

supervise for what purpose the lorry is used. "

I observe that the said case was decided under Animals Act. Under the Animals

Act, a vehicle involved in an offence shall not be confiscated if the owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use

of such vehicle or that the vehicle has been used without his knowledge for the

commission of the offence. Therefore a vehicle owner under Animals Act can

claim his vehicle if he fulfills one of the above two requirements. However the

Forest Ordinance does not afford such options for a vehicle owner in a similar

manner as in the Animals Act. Therefore I am of the view that a vehicle owner

under Forest Ordinance has a heavier burden than a vehicle owner under the

Animals Act. Even if I am to agree with the contention of the Learned President's

Counsel to some extent, the appellant's inability in constantly monitoring the

driver would not discharge the burden cast on him. It is trite law that merely giving

instructions is not sufficient to discharge the said burden. For an example, if we

place giving mere instructions, which is not sufficient, on one end and expecting

the owner to go with the driver on every trip, which is quite irrational on the other

end, there must be something rationale in-between these two points that satisfies

Page 8 of 10

the Court. In the above background, denying the knowledge of an offence being

committed is definitely not sufficient to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle

owner. I observe that the appellant has not proved that he had taken every possible

precaution to prevent an offence being committed.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Learned

Magistrate had not given rationale reasons as to why he rejected the credibility of

the appellant's evidence which was given in the Magistrate's Court. It is contended

that it was highly unreasonable for the Learned Magistrate to refuse the evidence

simply relying on one mismatch of a single fact. I observe that the Learned

Magistrate has given reasons for such rejection i.e. contradictions in the appellant's

evidence and lack of corroboration (Page 89 of the brief). I am of the view that the

aforesaid 3rd ground of appeal should also fail since the Learned Magistrate was

considering the weight of the evidence and not the number of witnesses.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every

litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to

make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of

appeal ... " (Emphasis added)

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was

correct in refusing to interfere with the order of the Learned Magistrate. Therefore

I affirm both orders dated 20.06.2013 and 08.12.2011. This decision is applicable

Page 9 of 10

to Case bearing No. CA (PHC) APN 80/2013 which is a revision application filed

by the appellant on the same matter.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
