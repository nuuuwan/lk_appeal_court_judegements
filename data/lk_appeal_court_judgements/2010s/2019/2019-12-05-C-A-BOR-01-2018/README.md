The Appellants have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court in terms of

Section 28(1) of the Land Acquisition Act No.9 of 1950 as amended, (referred to

as the Act) to set aside order dated 26/0712012, made by the Board of Review

(BOR). The said order was made upon an appeal to the BOR from an award by the

Page 2 of 9

Respondent-Respondent dated 07/09/2009, (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) made in terms of Section 17 of the Act.

The Appellants land identified as Lot No. 65 in Survey-General's

Preliminary Plan bearing No. 116/Gam (at page 82 of the brief) in extent of

27 A.2R.32P was acquired by the Respondent in 1981 , in terms of Section 38(a) of

the Act, for the purpose of the then Greater Colombo Economic Commission, later

known as the Board of Investment, to set up the Biyagama Export Processing

Zone.

The inquiry into claims for compensation in terms of Section 9 of the Act

commenced on 18/0611981. During the inquiry a dispute between the claimant's

rights and title over the land was referred to the District Court of Gampaha in

terms of Section 1 O( I )(b) of the Act. At the stage of inquiry into claims for

compensation, the 3 Appellants entered into 3 separate agreements on 14/0511982,

(at page 64, 65 and 66 of the brief) by which the Appellants received a sum of Rs.

154,000/- as a relief payment (orom <;JB ~ mJe:ll:li). The Appellants also agreed

that the said payment received is deductible at the time of payment of

compensation. By award dated 07/09/2009, made in terms of Section 17 of the

Act, the Appellants were awarded a sum of Rs. 750,000/-. The Appellants

preferred an appeal against the said award to the BOR. By the impugned order

dated 26/07/2012, the BOR dismissed the appeal on the basis that the Appellants

have been paid the balance compensation on 17/0311986 and therefore, the

Appellants have no right of Appeal under the law. The Appellants submit that

apart from the acceptance of the relief payment by the said agreement, they are not

privy to any communication by the Respondent or proof of payment of

compensation made to them. The Appellants further submit that the Respondent's

letter to the BOR dated 08112/2010, would justify that only a sum ofRs. 154,0001-

has been paid.

The BOR has dismissed the appeal on the basis that the Appellants have

accepted part of the payment of compensation in advance and therefore, the appeal

is liable to be dismissed in terms of the proviso (a) to Section 22(1) of the Act. The

present appeal stems from the said decision.

Section 22( 1) of the Act states,

(I) "A person to whom compensation is allowed by an award under section 17

and who has notified his claim for compensation to the Acquiring Officer

within the time allowed therefor by this Act may appeal to the board against

that award on the ground that the amount of the compensation allowed to

him is insufficient:

Provided that-

a) where, before such person prefers an appeal against such award, the

whole or any part of the compensation allowed to him by such award is

tendered to him by the Acquiring Officer and he does not decline to

Page 4 of9

receive the amount so tendered, he shall not have the right to prefer an

appeal against such award; and

b) where, after he has preferred an appeal against such award and before

such appeal is decided by the Board, the whole or any part of such

compensation is tendered to him by the Acquiring Officer and he does

not decline to receive the amount so tendered,

the Board shall dismiss such appeal. "

The Appellants submit that the proviso to Section 22(1) of the Act is to

prevent an awardee to receive the whole or part of the compensation 'allowed by

such award' and then appeal against the said award.

In the written submissions filed of record, the Respondent submits that

there is no provision in the Act to make any sought of compensatory/ex gratia or

other payment to be made before compensation is calculated and therefore,

compensation can only be granted after the award is made and calculated.

At the hearing of this appeal the learned Counsel for the Respondent

contended that the Appellants received a conditional relief payment as an advance

prior to the award i tsel f been made known to them . It is also contended that the

word 'allowed' in the phrase ' by such award' in the said proviso, clearly points to

the fact that what is contemplated is the post award receipt of compensation.

By agreements reached between the claimants and the Respondent, a sum

of Rs. J 54,000/- was received by the Appellants prior to the written notice of the

Page 5 of9

Website Copy Website Copy

award under Section 17 of the Act. The impugned order refers to a further

payment of compensation made on 17/03/ 1986.

As stated by the chief valuer by his letter dated 28/02/1986, the market

value of the land for the purpose of payment of compensation was Rs. 750,000/-.

The impugned order refers to a balance payment of compensation paid to the

claimants on 17/03/1986. The Respondent's letter dated 09/07/1986, addressed to

the Administrative Officer of the Board of Investment, which is filed of record,

refers to the said payment. However, the Appellants deny receiving any further

payment other than the part payment received by the aforesaid agreements.

The Appellants draw attention to the Respondents letter dated 08/12/20 I 0,

to the BOR (at pages 62 and 63 of the brief) which states that even though

reference is made to compensation been paid to the Appellants on two previous

occasions, on the available documentation the Respondent can confirm that the

Appellants have been paid only Rs. 154,000/- as an advance payment. Therefore,

it is important to note that when the Appellants reached agreement with the

Respondent to accept Rs. 154,000/-, as an advance payment on 14/05/1982, the

market value of the land was not known to the claimants.

In this context, the question to be asked is, when the market value of the

land to be acquired is not known, is it possible for a claimant to arrive at a

settlement on the question of compensation?

If the answer to the above question is in the negative, then the proviso to

Section 22( I )(a) should not be applicable to a claimant who has agreed to receive

a reliefl advance payment of compensation prior to the claimant knowing the /

market value of the land to be acquired.

Section 9 of the Act provides that,

(I) "Where a notice under section 7. in respect of any land is published, the

acquiring officer of the district in which that land is situated shall, on the date

on which and at the time and place at which persons interested in that land are

directed by that notice or in accordance with the proviso to section 7. (2) (c) to

appear before him, hold an inquiry into-

(a) the market value of that land or of the servitude which is to be acquired

over that land;

(b) such claims for compensation as may have been notified to him within the

time allowed therefor by that notice or in accordance with the aforesaid

proviso;

(c) the respective interests of the persons claiming compensation; and

(d) any other matter which needs investigation for the purpose of making an

award under section 17. "

Therefore, Section 9 of the Act empowers the Acquiring Officer of the

District to hold an inquiry, inter alia, regarding the market value of the land,

claims for compensation, ect.

In Pearl Kalaliadde Goonathi/aka Vs. Gananayake and Others (2004) 3

SLR 163, Weerasuriya J. held that;

"The position taken up by the AppeLLant that the compensation is offered only at

the award stage and the acceptance of compensation cannot be interpreted as

acquiescence or waiver of statutory right which would nullifY the purposes of

section 12 and section 22 is unacceptable. The right of appeal in section 22(1) is

in respect of awards which are considered insufficient. "

The instant application can be clearly distinguished from the aforesaid case

on the basis that when the agreement reached at the stage of the statutory inquiry

between the Appellants and the Respondent to accept the relief! advance payment,

the Appellants were unaware of the market value of the land to arrive at a

settlement on the question of compensation.

In Pearl Kalaliadde Goonathi/aka Vs. Gananayake and Others (supra), it

was further held that,

"The governing principle seems to be that by reaching an agreement at the stage

of the inquiry, the appeLLant has satisfied herself with the adequacy of

compensation aLLowed. "

Page 80f9

The Appellants in the instant case cannot be said to have been satisfied with

the adequacy of compensation allowed, since they were unaware of the valuation

of the land at the stage of accepting the relief payment.

[n the circumstances, [ find that the Appellants by accepting the reliefl

advance payment has not acquiesced or waived their right of appeal in terms of the

proviso to Section 22 of the Act and therefore, I set aside the order dated

26/0712012, and direct the Board of Review to proceed with the Appeal.

Appeal allowed, I make no order as to costs.
