We hold that the High Court has the jurisdiction to hear and

determine a revision application from an order of a Magistrate in a case

filed under the State Land (Revocary of Possession) Act.

Hence, we quash the order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 09.12.2015 and make order to accept the revision application

and to proceed with this case. Application is allowed.

We direct the Registrar to communicate this order to the

High Court of Hambantota and to the Magistrate's Court of Hambantota

forthwith by tele- fax and telephone at the expense of the petitioner.
