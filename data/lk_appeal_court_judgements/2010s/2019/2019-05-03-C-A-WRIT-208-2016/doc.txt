Introduction

The petitioners filed this application basically against the 1st

respondent seeking to quash by way of writs of certiorari the

following decisions:

a) Appointment of the 3rd respondent as a member of the

National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) by

letter marked D;

b) Appointment of the 3rd respondent as the Chairman of

the Authority; and

c) Appointment of the 4th respondent as the Acting Chief

Executive Officer of the Authority by letter marked M.

What is the National Medicines Regulatory Authority?

In Sri Lanka, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority was

created by National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No.5 of

2015.

As the long title of the Act states the NMRA is responsible for the

regulation and control of registration, licensing, manufacture,

importation and all other aspects pertaining to medicines,

medical devices, borderline products and for the conducting of

clinical trials in a manner compatible with the national

medicines policy.

According to section 3 of the Act, the objects of the Authority

shall be to:

7

a) ensure the availability of efficacious, safe and good quality

medicines, medical devices and borderline products to the

general public at affordable prices;

b) function as the central regulator for all matters connected

with the registration, licensing, cancellation of registration

or licensing, pricing, manufacture, importation, storage,

transport, distribution, sale, advertising and disposal of

medicines, medical devices and borderline products;

c) ensure that all activities related to registration, licensing

and importation of medicines, medical devices, borderline

products and investigational medicinal products are carried

out in a transparent, sustainable and equitable manner;

d) encourage the manufacturing of good quality medicines in

Sri Lanka with a view to assuring the availability of

essential medicines at affordable prices;

e) promote the safe and rational use of medicines, medical

devices and borderline products by health care

professionals and consumers;

f) recommend appropriate amendments to relevant laws

pertaining to medicines, medical devices and borderline

products;

g) educate the general public, health care professionals and

all stakeholders on medicines, medical devices and

borderline products;

h) regulate the promotion and marketing of medicines, medical

devices and borderline products;

i) regulate the availability of the medicines, medical devices

and borderline products;

8

j) conduct post marketing surveillance on quality, safety and

adverse reaction of the medicines, medical devices and

borderline products; and

k) regulate all matters pertaining to the conduct of clinical

trials in Sri Lanka.

Section 146 of the Act defines borderline products as the

products having combined characteristics of medicines and foods,

medicines and medical devices or medicines and cosmetics.

Section 14 of the Act, which describes the powers and functions

of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority, reads as follows:

The powers and functions of the Authority shall be to:

a) decide on classifying a product as a medicine, medical

device, borderline product or any other product;

b) authorize registration and licensing of medicines, medical

devices, borderline products and investigational medicinal

products or cancel or suspend any such registration or

licence in terms of this Act;

c) regulate the registration, licensing, manufacture,

importation, storage, re-packing, transportation,

distribution, sale, advertising, promotion, recall and

disposal of medicines, medical devices, borderline products

or investigational medicinal products;

d) authorize registration and regulation of Pharmacies and

medicines stores;

e) issue licences for manufacture, import, storage, distribution,

transport and sale of medicines, medical devices, borderline

9

products or investigational medicinal products and to cancel

such licences in terms of this Act;

f) appoint sub-committees as may be necessary for the

effective discharge of the functions of the Authority;

g) grant approval for the custom clearance of consignments of

medicines, medical devices, borderline products, raw

materials, packing materials, machinery or laboratory

material needed for local manufacture of medicines,

medical devices, borderline products or investigational

medicinal products subject to the provisions of this Act and

any other written law;

h) conduct awareness programmes in relation to medicines,

medical devices and borderline products and post market

surveillance on the quality and safety of medicines, medical

devices, borderline products and investigational medicinal

products which are registered and licensed under this Act;

i) monitor the registration and licensing process and the

usage of medicines, medical devices, borderline products or

investigational medicinal products which are registered and

licensed under this Act for adverse reactions through use

thereof, and to take immediate and necessary action in

such an instance;

j) collect data on quantities of medicines, medical devices,

borderline products or investigational medicinal products

imported under licences;

k) collect data on utilization of medicines, medical devices,

borderline products and investigational medicinal products

in Sri Lanka, including data on expenditure of industry and

trade, relating to promotional activities;

10

l) advise the Minister on matters which are required to be

prescribed;

m) acquire, hold, take or give on lease or hire, mortgage,

pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of, any movable or

immovable property;

n) charge fees where necessary and appropriate in the

discharge of its functions;

o) recognize and appoint other local or overseas laboratories

for testing of any medicine, medical device or borderline

product as may be deemed necessary;

p) follow Good Regulatory Practices (GRP) as prescribed in

regulations;

q) determine the initial price of medicines, medical devices

and borderline products and advise the Minister on

subsequent price revisions;

r) provide information pertaining to the functions of the

Authority to the stakeholders and general public; and

s) issue, review and update guidelines, recommendations,

directives and rules as applicable to medicines, medical

devices and borderline products.

The industry involved in medicine, medical devices, borderline

products and investigational medicinal products is undoubtedly

a multi-billion dollar industry globally, and prone to corruption.

Hence there is a dire need to keep it under strict regulation and

supervision particularly in the best interests of one of the most

vulnerable segments in the society-the sick.

From the above provisions of the Act alone, it is abundantly

clear that the National Medicines Regulatory Authority, being

11

the central regulator for all matters connected with medicine, is

a very important body with enormous powers, which can make a

huge impact on the society.

Appointment of the 3rd respondent as a Member of the

NMRA

Section 4 of the Act provides for the constitution of the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority. It reads as follows:

The Authority shall consist of the following:

(a) ex-officio members-

(i) the Director-General of Health Services;

(ii) the Secretary to the Treasury or his nominee; and

(iii) the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority appointed

under section 15 who shall function as the Secretary

to the Authority;

(b) Following persons who shall be appointed by the

Minister (hereinafter referred to as appointed

members)-

(i) four specialist clinicians attached to the Ministry of

Health, representing the following clinical disciplines,

nominated by their respective professional bodies-

(A) General Medicine;

(B) General Surgery;

(C) Peadiatrics; and

(D) Gynecology and Obstetrics;

(ii) a Professor in Pharmacology of any University in Sri

Lanka established under the Universities Act, No.16

of 1978, appointed in rotation for every three years,

12

in consultation with the respective Deans of Faculties

of Medicine;

(iii) a Professor or Senior Lecturer in Pharmacy of any

University in Sri Lanka established under the

Universities Act, No.16 of 1978, appointed in rotation

for every three years, in consultation with the

respective Deans of relevant Faculties;

(iv) four professionals, who have gained eminence in the

fields of management, law, accountancy or health

respectively.

According to the letter marked D, the appointment of the 3rd

respondent to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority has

been made by the 1st respondent in terms of section 4(b)(iv) of

the Act.

This vacancy was created by the 1st respondent by removing the

Accountant from the Authority. Letter marked C dated

20.05.2016 sent by the 1st respondent to the said Accountant

reads: Please be informed that you are removed from the said

office forthwith since I want to strengthen the authority with more

health professionals. Letter D referred to earlier is of the same

date.

This appointment, in my view, violates section 4(b)(iv) of the Act.

If the accountancy professional is removed from the Authority,

he shall be replaced with another accountancy professional. As

the subsection stands today, the purposive interpretation which

could be given to it is that four professionals each of the

13

respective professions of management, law, accountancy and

health shall constitute the Authority.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the 1st

respondent argues that what is stated in section 4(b)(iv) is that

the 1st respondent can appoint four professionals, who have

gained eminence in the fields of management, law, accountancy

or health respectively and not management, law, accountancy

and health, and therefore the appointment of another health

professional in place of accountancy professional is not bad in

law. The learned Senior State Counsel goes further to argue

that the word respectively used in the subsection is

superfluous and therefore shall be disregarded.

I am unable to accept that argument.

If that argument is accepted, the 1st respondent can, under that

subsection, appoint four management professionals or four law

professionals or four accountancy professionals or four health

professionals. That interpretation leads nothing but to

absurdity.

If the National Medicines Regulatory Authority needs to be

strengthened with more health professionals, subsection 4(b)(iv)

shall be amended to simply read as four health professionals

instead of stating four professionals, who have gained eminence

in the fields of management, law, accountancy or health

respectively.

The word respectively, which finds a prominent place at the

beginning of the subsection in the Sinhala version of the Act,

14

cannot be disregarded. ( , ,

.)

Instead, the word or found in that subsection shall be taken to

mean and as that was the word the 1st respondent meant to be

used as seen from the speech made by the 1st respondent in

Parliament at the second reading of the Bill and reported in

Hansard. This interpretation is in keeping with the spirit and

intention of this special piece of legislation.

Parliamentary debates reported in Hansard can be made use of

to interpret a Statute.

In Shiyam v. OIC Narcotics Bureau [2006] 2 Sri LR 156 at 164-

165 a Full Bench of the Supreme Court stated as follows:

Thus, Justice Mark Fernando had recognized section 3(1) of

the Bail Act as a provision which excludes any other

written law which makes express provision for the release

on bail of persons accused or suspected of offences under

that written law. This position could be further clarified by

an examination of the parliamentary proceedings pertaining

to the Bail Bill.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents

contended that the parliamentary proceedings could be

used by the Court to ascertain the intention of the

legislature.

Until the land mark decision in Pepper v. Hart [1993] 1 All

ER 42 the rule followed by the English judges had been

that parliamentary debates reported in Hansard could not

be referred to in order to facilitate the interpretation of a

statute. However, by the decision in Pepper v. Hart (supra),

a new practice came into being relaxing the exclusionary

16

rule and permitting reference to parliamentary material.

Referring to this new approach, Lord Griffiths in Pepper v.

Hart (supra) stated that,

The Courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks

to give effect to the true purpose of legislation and are

prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears

upon the background against which the legislation was

enacted.

In Sri Lanka, the Courts were reluctant to consider the

proceedings in the Parliament for the purpose of

interpretation. However, the attitude of our Courts took a

new turn tilting towards a purposive approach in J.B.

Textiles Industries Ltd. v. Minister of Finance and Planning

[1981] 1 Sri LR 156 where Samarakoon, C.J., expressed the

view that,

Hansards are admissible to prove that course of

proceedings in the legislature.

Since the decision in J.B. Textile Industries Ltd., (supra), our

Courts had acted with approval the acceptability in

perusing the Hansard for the purpose of ascertaining the

intention of the Parliament. Manawadu v. Attorney General

[1987] 2 Sri LR 30. In fact in De Silva and Others v. Jeyaraj

Fernandopulle and Others [1996] 1 Sri LR 22 Mark

Fernando, J. adopted the observations of Samarakoon, C.J.

in J.B. Textiles Industries Ltd., case (supra) which stated as

follows:

17

The Hansard is the official publication of Parliament. It is

published to keep the public informed of what takes place

in Parliament. It is neither sacrosanct nor untouchable.

It is therefore apparent that the Court which now adopts a

purposive approach, could refer to the Hansard for the

purpose of ascertaining the intention and the true purpose

of the legislature in order to interpret the legislation which

is ambiguous, obscure or leading to an absurdity.

The speech made by the then Hon. Minister of Justice, Prof.

G. L. Peiris at the introduction of the Bail Act, would thus be

important in the interpretation of section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

Hence the appointment of the 3rd respondent as a member by

letter marked D is bad in law and therefore null and void ab

initio.

Appointment shall be for the Balance Period only

Letter D further states that Your term of office shall be for a

period of three years. This is also bad in law.

According to section 9(1) of the Act the appointed member shall

hold office for a period of three years. Section 9(4)(c) says that

when a member is removed and another appointed in his place,

the latter shall hold office for the unexpired period of the term of

office of the member whom he succeeds.

After the institution of this action by the document marked R10

dated 05.08.2016 this has later been corrected by the 1st

18

respondent to say that the appointments of the 3rd respondent

as a Member and Chairman shall expire on 13.05.2018.

Conflict of Interest

Letter D further states:

Apart from the above, you may need to declare before

accepting the appointment that you have no financial or

other conflict of interest of the affairs of the Authority, which

is likely to affect adversely in discharging your functions as

a member of the Authority within the last 3 years and at

present.

This has been included in the Letter of Appointment marked D

in view of section 6 of the Act, which reads as follows:

6(1) The Minister shall, prior to appointing a person as a

member of the Authority, satisfy himself that such person

has no financial or other conflict of interest in the affairs of

the Authority, as is likely to affect adversely, the

discharging of his functions as a member of the Authority.

(2) The Minister shall also satisfy himself, from time to time,

that no member of the Authority has since being appointed

acquired any such interest.

(3) The person to be appointed as a member of the Authority

shall be a person who has not been engaged in any

employment or assignment in the pharmaceutical industry

within the period of three years immediately prior to such

appointment.

19

(4) No person shall engage in any employment or

assignment in the pharmaceutical industry within the

period of three years immediately after such person ceased

to be a member of the Authority.

(5)(a) A member of the Authority who is in any way, directly

or indirectly interested in any contract made or proposed to

be made by the Authority shall disclose the nature of his

interest at a meeting of the Authority; and

(b) Such disclosure shall be recorded in the minutes of the

Authority and the member shall not participate in any

deliberation or decision of the Authority with regard to that

contract.

(6) Minister may make regulations to further specify and

give effect to the provisions of this section.

(7) For the purposes of this section-

a member of the authority includes the Chairman, an

appointed member and an ex-officio member; and

conflict of interest includes any dealing with any

company or undertaking which engages in

manufacturing, importation, distribution or sale of

medicines, medical devices, borderline products or

investigational medicinal products.

In terms of section 146 investigational medicinal product means

a product which is under investigation by a clinical trial or

equivalent studies which may include a medicine, medical device

or a borderline product.

20

Section 7(d) of the Act is also relevant in this regard. It reads:

A person shall be disqualified from being appointed or

continuing as a member of the Authority, if he has any

financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially

the discharge by him of his functions as a member of the

Authority.

Letter marked D is the Letter of Appointment appointing the 3rd

respondent as a member of the Authority. According to this

letter, the 1st respondent has asked the 3rd respondent to

declare, before accepting the appointment, that the latter has no

financial or other conflict of interest of the affairs of the

Authority, which is likely to affect adversely in discharging his

functions as a member of the Authority within the last 3 years

and at present.

This is also violative of section 6(1) of the Act which requires

The Minister shall, prior to appointing a person as a member of

the Authority, satisfy himself that such person has no financial or

other conflict of interest in the affairs of the Authority, as is likely

to affect adversely, the discharging of his functions as a member

of the Authority.

I am unable to accept the argument of the learned Senior State

Counsel that: Theoretically, the Minister can rely on the general

reputation of the intended appointee and his own intuition and

form an opinion that such a conflict of interest does not exist.

Importantly, section 6(1) does not set out any particular procedure

the Minister should follow to satisfy himself that no conflict of

21

interest exists. The 1st respondent is there performing a public

duty and not a private duty.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and the

learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th-12th and 15th

respondents strenuously contend that as there is a conflict of

interest, the 1st respondent could not have appointed the 3rd

respondent as a member of the Authority. It is noteworthy that

the 7th-12th and 15th respondents are also Members of the

Authority.

It is important to realize that the word used in section 6(1) and

7(d) is likely. Section 6(1) speaks of financial or other conflict

of interest as is likely to affect adversely in the discharge of

duties as a member. Section 7(d) is, in my view, couched in

even broader terms. It speaks of financial or other interest (not

necessarily conflict of interest) as is likely to affect prejudicially

in the discharge of duties as a member. The test under section

7(d) is objective. By looking at those sections it is clear that, a

member of the Authority, like Caesars wife, must be above

suspicion. The member shall, as seen from subsections 6(2)-(4),

maintain that position not only during the course of his holding

the office, but before and after, for a period of three years.

Let me now advert to the reply of the 3rd respondent to the letter

marked D. The letter D was replied by the 3rd respondent by the

letter marked E dated 31.05.2016. By that letter, the 3rd

respondent has first accepted the appointment.

Thereafter the 3rd respondent has stated as follows:

22

In accepting the aforesaid appointment I need to keep you

fully informed of my existing obligations that I need to

continue with.

I have held various positions in academia over 23 years

and have been a university professor in pharmacology

since 2005. I am presently (as well as within the last three

years) engaged in the following areas of work in my

professional capacity:

1. Teaching and examining undergraduate and

postgraduate medical students.

2. Performing, administering and managing medical

research, including clinical trials, in collaboration with local

and international investigators and institutions. This is

done through the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), Faculty of

Medicine, University of Kelaniya and RemediumOne (Pvt)

Ltd, a company established as a public-private partnership,

which is affiliated to the Faculty of Medicine, University of

Kelaniya. I am a Director of both, the CTU and

RemediumOne.

3. Private consultation practice outside university

working hours.

To the best of my knowledge, I have no reason to believe

that any of the above functions conflict with my

responsibilities as a member of the National Medicines

Regulatory Authority nor will they adversely affect the

authoritys functions. However, I will resign from the Board

of Directors of RemediumOne to avoid any appearance of a

conflict of interest, real or perceived, and however remote.

23

If we take letter E at its best, by that letter the 3rd respondent

admits that he is presently (as well as within the last three

years) engaged in at least clinical trials. This is one area,

according to the Act, the Authority is seriously concerned with.

In terms of section 3, one of the objects of the Authority is to

regulate all matters pertaining to the conduct of clinical trials in

Sri Lanka, and the long title of the Act states that there will be a

Clinical Trials Regulatory Division in the Authority.

According to section 6(7), conflict of interest includes any

dealing with any company or undertaking which engages in inter

alia investigational medicinal products, and according to

section 146 investigational medicinal product means a product

(such as medicine, medical device or a borderline product) which

is under investigation by a clinical trial.

According to letter E, the 3rd respondent has been conducting

clinical trials in collaboration with local and international

investigators and institutions through the Clinical Trials Unit of

the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya and

RemediumOne (Pvt) Ltd, a company established as a public-

private partnership, which is affiliated to the Faculty of

Medicine, University of Kelaniya.

The learned Presidents Counsel strenuously submits that there

is no proof except the ipse dixit of the 3rd respondent in

document marked E that RemediumOne is a company

established as a public-private partnership with the University

or any other. According to clause 3 of the Articles of Association

of RemediumOne marked H dated 25.09.2009, the company is a

24

fully private owned company and Any invitation to the public to

subscribe for shares or other securities of the Company is

prohibited. There is no mention about any partnership with the

Kelaniya University in the Articles of Association. Further,

according to the Articles of Association, the initial shareholders

are the 3rd respondent, a businessman and an engineer. By

looking at the objects of the company-all medically related-the

learned Presidents Counsel submits that the 3rd respondent

who plays the central role in the company is in fact the alter ego

of the company. As seen from the Annual Return of the

company on 11.08.2015 marked H1, the former two

shareholders-the businessman and the engineer-have ceased to

be shareholders and new shareholders have come in. According

to H1, the 3rd respondent holds 1 share and his wife 31,000

shares.

The 3rd respondent, as seen from H2, has, after his appointment

as a member of the Authority, resigned from the Board of

Directors of the company. But the owners of a company are not

the Directors but the Shareholders.

Under tab About Us it says:

As Sri Lankas pioneering clinical research company, our

research management services span multiple disciplines

from paediatrics to geriatrics, diabetes to oncology, and

subspecialty medicine to ophthalmology. We have access to

a wide network of tertiary-care hospitals and offer our

valued partners complete clinical trial management services

25

from submission to close out at selected healthcare

institutions. This is achieved by identifying highly qualified

medical specialists, providing suitably trained manpower,

dedicated coordination and an uncompromising attention to

quality. Our trained Clinical Research Coordinators are

permanently based in clinical trial sites at number of

government hospitals throughout the country. We have an

excellent track record of providing such services to both

academic institutions and multinational pharmaceutical

companies involving drug development.

Under the Tab Our Partners it says:

Over the last four years we have developed strong

collaborative links with a number of multi-national

companies and Clinical Research Organizations including

Covance, Ecron-Accunova, Ergomed, INC Research, Pharm-

Olam, Quintiles, and SIRO-Clinpharm. In addition, we work

closely with centres of academic excellence including the

Universities of Oxford and Nottingham, National University

of Singapore, Duke-NUS, Duke Clinical Research Institute

and George Institute for many investigator-sponsored

studies.

The document marked J is the webpage of the Clinical Trials

Unit of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya.

Under the Tab About Us it inter alia says:

The CTU, through its exclusive partnership with

RemediumOne, Sri Lanka's pioneering clinical research

26

company, facilitates the conduct of clinical trials in these

disease areas by providing suitably trained manpower,

scientific and logistical support, coordinating facilities, and

other support for academic institutions as well as

multinational pharmaceutical companies involved in the

development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Under the Tab Activities it says:

As an academic research unit, the CTU has the advantage

of having access to a large number of patients from multi-

specialty tertiary care hospitals as well as the community,

and to research knowledge and expertise available in other

university departments. Coupled with the excellent project

management skills that RemediumOne bring into the

equation, we are in a unique position to design and conduct

our own research as well as participate in large multi-centre

clinical research programmes.

Under the Tab Contacts, the only contactable person is the 3rd

respondent.

An Agreement entered into between the University of Kelaniya

and RemediumOne regarding conducting of Clinical Trials was

tendered by the petitioners with the counter affidavit marked R.

Clause 2 of that Agreement reads as follows:

2. PAYMENT TERMS

The University shall receive remuneration under this

Agreement, amounting to Five percent (5%) of

REMEDIUMONEs individual Client contract value up to US$

27

200,000 and thereon at Two percent (2%) where the value

of each such contract is in excess of US$ 200,000 up to a

maximum remuneration of US$ 50,000 per Client contract.

Payment shall be made as an annual payment during the

period of the contract between REMEDIUMONE and Client

and strictly on money received basis. This clause shall

become operative upon the execution of this Agreement.

In such contracts between the University and RemediumOne, it

is seen, RemediumOne retains 95% of the contract value

whereas only 5% goes to the University. This clause alone

explains the nature of the business of RemediumOne and the

relationship between the University and RemediumOne in

conducting Clinical Trials.

The petitioners have also tendered documents with counter

affidavit marked N, O and P obtained from Sri Lanka Clinical

Trials Registry to show the engagement of RemediumOne and

the 3rd respondent with the pharmaceutical industry.

The learned Senior State Counsel also argues that:

Section 6(3) prohibits the appointment of a person who has

been engaged in any employment or assignment in the

pharmaceutical industry within the three year period

preceding the appointment. Pharmaceutical industry is

not an ambiguous expression and can be defined with

relative certainty. The pharmaceutical industry consists of

public and private organizations that discover, develop,

manufacture and market medicines for human and animal

health.

28

The argument of the learned Senior State Counsel is that the 3rd

respondent is not a person who has been engaging in any

employment or assignment in the pharmaceutical industry. I

am unable to agree. According to the learned Senior State

Counsel himself The pharmaceutical industry consists of public

and private organizations that discover, develop, manufacture

and market medicines for human and animal health, and

according to the RemediumOne webpage marked I, We have an

excellent track record of providing such services to both academic

institutions and multinational pharmaceutical companies involved

in drug development.

It is clear that the activities/business of RemediumOne fall

within the regulatory framework of the Authority, and the

interests of RemediumOne are obviously commercial in nature

and profit driven.

The learned Senior State Counsel in his written submissions by

way of epilogue inter alia says that:

The 3rd respondent has achieved the highest level of

academic attainment in one of the most complex and

sophisticated disciplines at one of the most prestigious

universities in the world-Doctor of Philosophy from the

University of Oxford in Clinical Pharmacology. He is an

accomplished and respected medical professional and

academic. He has received a multiplicity of awards and

accolades throughout his career. There has never been any

credible complaint against him. His competence has never

29

been questioned; character never assailed; and commitment

never doubted.

Neither the petitioners nor the 7th-12th and 15th respondent

members of the Authority who support the case of the

petitioners dispute these facts.

It is abundantly clear that the legislature in its wisdom has,

through the Act, taken every possible and conceivable steps to

see that a person who has any semblance of financial or other

conflict of interest as is likely to affect adversely or prejudicially

in the discharge of his duties is not appointed as a member of

the Authority.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners has lucidly

explained it in the following manner:

a) The 3rd respondent was the Founding Director and

Shareholder of RemediumOne (Pvt) Ltd;

b) His wife still remains a Shareholder of RemediumOne;

c) The 3rd respondent is the Director of the Clinical Trials Unit

of the University of Kelaniya Medical Faculty;

d) The CTU University of Kelaniya and RemediumOne are in

partnership to provide Contract Research Organizations

the facilities to conduct Clinical Trials in Sri Lanka;

e) These Clinical Trials are in relation to Medicines and

Pharmaceutical products;

f) Most of the Clinical Trials are funded/sponsored by

Pharmaceutical Companies;

30

g) The result of any Clinical Trial would be important for the

said products path to be administered to patients in Sri

Lanka;

h) It may be that CTU Kelaniya University and RemediumOne

do not carry out work to bring out a particular desired result

and may even act with all high standard of ethics and

morality;

i) The question is not about RemediumOne and CTU Kelaniya

University trying to bring a desired result. The issue is that

they are in a position to give a result to the said Clients.

j) There is no doubt that there is conflict of interest and there

is likely to be a conflict of interest in the situation.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 7th-12th and 15th

respondent members of the Authority adds that:

It is obvious that any prudent business person/entity will

be drawn to approach RemediumOne/the Kelaniya

University for their Clinical Trial needs and other related

requirements/needs including the carrying out the

facilitation of clinical trials etc. [including the most crucial

obtaining of regulatory clearances], and would be attracted

and driven to securing the services of none other than the

person who is operating as the head of the NMRA.

The crucial question is not whether the 3rd respondent did or

whether he will, but whether he can.

I accept the arguments mounted by the learned Presidents

Counsel regarding conflict of interest.

31

For the aforesaid reasons, it is my considered view that the 3rd

respondent could not have been appointed as a member of the

Authority, particularly in terms of section 4(b)(iv), 6(1), 6(3), 7(d)

of the Act, and therefore the appointment made by the document

marked D is ultra vires.

Appointment of the 3rd Respondent as the Chairman

Section 5(1) of the Act reads as follows:

The Minister shall, in consultation with the Authority,

appoint one of the appointed members to be the Chairman

of the Authority.

According to section 5(4), the term of office of the Chairman

shall be the period of his membership of the Authority.

In terms of section 5(1), the Minister shall appoint one of the

appointed members to be the Chairman of the Authority in

consultation with the Authority.

It is the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioners that the 1st respondent did not consult the Authority

prior to the said appointment. This is confirmed by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 7th-12th and 15th respondent

members of the Authority, who state that It is emphatically

submitted that these respondents were never consulted prior to

the appointmentvide paragraphs 5(iii), 64-66 of the written

submissions. The learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioners submits that, the position of the 1st respondent that

he consulted some members on the 13th May 2016 is not

32

supported by any Minutes of such meeting and in any event no

consultation could have taken place on the 13th May 2016 in

respect of a person who is not a Member of the NMRA at the time.

If the 3rd respondent could not have been appointed as a

member of the Authority in the first place, it is obvious that he

could not have been appointed as the Chairman of the

Authority.

The appointment of the 3rd respondent as the Chairman of the

Authority for the period covered in the document marked D and

later amended by document marked R10 is therefore ultra vires.

Appointment of the 4th Respondent as the Acting CEO

On the direction of the 1st respondent, the 4th respondent has

been appointed as the Acting Chief Executive Officer by letter

marked M dated 03.06.2016.

Section 15(1) of the Act reads as follows:

The Authority shall in consultation with the Minister,

appoint to the Staff of the Authority a Chief Executive

Officer from among persons who hold a postgraduate

degree from a recognized University in Medicine,

Pharmacology, Pharmacy or any other related discipline

with at least five years management experience at senior

executive level.

It is clear that it is the Authority which has the power to appoint

a Chief Executive Officer, whether permanent or acting, in

consultation with the Minister.

33

This has later been corrected as seen from documents marked

R16, R16A-R16C.

The appointment made by document marked M is ultra vires.

Futility

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the 1st-5th, 14th

and 16th respondents states thus:

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash the

appointment of the 3rd respondent as both a member and

Chairman of the Authority. He was appointed as a member

on 20th May 2016 and as Chairman on 13th June 2016.

However, the respondents term of office as a member (and

consequently his Chairmanship) came to an end on 13th

May 2018. This is not disputed by the petitioner. He has

subsequently been appointed as both a member and a

Chairman-on 15th May 2018 and 18th May 2018

respectively. To be clear, these appointments are

independent and distinct from his previous appointment.

The petitioner continues to challenge only the now expired

appointments. It is for this reason that [it is] submitted that

this application is futile. No meaningful purpose will be

served by granting certiorari. Even if this Court holds that

the respondents appointment was illegal that ruling will

apply only to the appointment actually challenged.

I do concede that the ruling in this case will apply only to the

appointments actually challenged, i.e. previous appointments,

34

but I do not concede that no purpose would be served by

allowing the application.

It is well settled law that rights of the parties shall be

determined at the time of the institution of the action. (Talagune

v. De Livera [1997] 1 Sri LR 253 at 255, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd

v. Minister of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235

at 248, Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank [1998] 3 Sri LR 197 at

198)

In the application for writ of mandamus, in Abayadeera v. Dr.

Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo

[1983] 2 Sri LR 267 at 280, it was held that:

The petition in this case was filed on 30.6.83. The

Emergency (Universities) Regulations No. 1 of 1983, cited

by learned counsel for the petitioners, and on which he

founded an argument, were made on 21.7.83. In our view

these regulations have no application, for, rights of parties

are their rights at the date the petitioners application was

made (Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268,

272, Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499, 500) and must be

decided according to the law as it existed when the

application was made (10 NLR 44 at 51); Ponnamma v.

Arumugam 8 NLR 223, 226.

In Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour & Vocational

Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248, the petitioners sought to

quash the arbitral award by certiorari and prohibition.

Dismissing that application, Jayasuriya J. inter alia stated:

35

It is trite law that a court or tribunal must determine and

ascertain the rights of parties as at the date of the

institution of the action or as at the date of the making of

the reference for arbitration. Commencement of the action is

the time at which the rights of the parties are to be

ascertained. Vide Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499 (PC),

Mohamed v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268, Bartleet v. Marikkar

40 NLR 350. The claim and demand on behalf of the

workers who were members of the fourth respondent trade

union had been made on 12th of March, 1988. The

reference by the Minister of Labour for settlement by

arbitration had been made on the 24th of November, 1989

and the statement of the matter in dispute has been framed

by the Commissioner of Labour and specified on the 24th of

November, 1989. In the circumstances, the arbitrator had

jurisdiction, authority and right to decree the grant of a

salary increase of Rs. 250 with effect from 24.11.89.

Therefore this Court is duty bound to make a determination

concerning the rights of the parties at the time of the institution

of the action.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner, as seen from

the early journal entries, has desperately sought to support the

application for an interim order and notice, but the same had

been kept on postponing on various reasons due to no fault of

the petitioner.

36

The Court will not be acting in vein by allowing the application

notwithstanding the appointments challenged in this application

are no more live issues.

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 the petitioner-

appellant applied for certiorari and mandamus against the

refusal to issue a liquor license for 1987. When it came before

the Supreme Court the matter was only academic as the year

1987 had lapsed. Nonetheless, whilst allowing the appeal,

Amarasinghe J. took the view that The court will not be acting in

vain in quashing the determination not to issue the licence for

1987 because the right of the petitioner to be fully and fairly

heard in future applications is being recognised.

In Nimalasiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela [2003] 3 Sri LR 85,

Sripavan J. (later C.J.) stated:

Learned State Counsel urged that it is a futile exercise to

issue a writ of certiorari because the decision complained of

related to the year 2002 which had already expired.

However, following the decision in Sudakaran v. Barathi

and others [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 this Court issues a writ of

certiorari quashing the decision of the second respondent

contained in the letter dated 27.08.2002 marked (P4). Thus

this Court is not acting in vain because the right of the

petitioner to be fully and fairly heard in future application is

recognized.

37

Conclusion

The appointment of the 3rd respondent as a member of the

National Medicines Regulatory Authority by document marked D

amended by R10, and the appointment of the 3rd respondent as

the Chairman during that period covered in the said documents,

and the appointment of the 4th respondent as the Acting Chief

Executive Officer by document marked M are bad in law and

therefore null and void ab initio. I quash those appointments by

way of writ of certiorari.

Application of the petitioner is allowed with costs.
