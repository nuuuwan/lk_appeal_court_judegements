Argued and

Decided on 0111112019

Hon. Justice Janak De Silva

Learned counsel for the Petitioner heard in Support of the averments in the

Petition. Learned counsel for the 4th_8th Respondents raises several preliminary

objections to the maintainability of the application. Learned Senior State Counsel

also heard.

Petitioner in this case is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Section 17

Award made under the Land Acquisition Act marked as "P 15" to the Petition. A

further Writ of Mandamus is sought compelling to re inquire into the ownership claim

of the land known as "Kalawila Watta".

It appears that the document marked "PIS" which is an award made under the

Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act was made in 2003 (Page 61 of P 12). The

prayer to the Petition refers to this document as an undated order. Learned counsel for

the 4th_8th Respondents in his preliminary objections submitted that this was a

conscious effort on the part of the Petitioner to overcome any objection based on

delay since, at least by 2007 the Petitioner became aware that P IS was made in 2003

in view of document marked P3 which is a letter dated 04/08/2007 sent by the

Divisional Secretary, Beruwala to B.D.K. Yamuna Kumari, Attorney at Law and

Notary Public who had communicated with the said Divisional Secretary on behalf of

the Petitioners by "P 2".

Learned counsel for the 4 ~l -8th Respondents accordingly submitted that this

application has been filed more that 12 years after the Petitioners became aware of

"P 15" and that Court should refuse notice due to delay. It is an established position

that delay is a ground on which discretionary relief can be refused.

3

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in response submitted, that in terms of Biso

Menika vs. De Alwis and others [(1982) I SrLL.R.368] delay does not per say prevent

the Petitioner from obtaining relief if the order impugned is a nUllity and the reasons

for the delay has been explained. In that case the Supreme Court held that if the

Petitioner can explain that he has sought legal remedies before invoking the Writ

jurisdiction as supposed to extra-legal remedies that can be considered in favor of the

Petitioner. The learned counsel for the Petitioner refers to the fact that he sought to

intervene in LA 05/20 II which is the application made in terms of Section 1 O( 1) of

the Land Acquisition Act by the Divisional Secretary.

The learned counsel for the Petitioners further submits that he also moved the

High Court of the Western Province Holden in Kalutara against P 15 in Application

No. 30/2007 in which case the learned High Court Judge issued a Writ of Mandamus

which order was set aside by this Court in CA (PHC ) 178/2008 on 13/06/2016.

Even if this Court, accepts the proposition fonnulated by the learned counsel

for the Petitioners there is at least another three years delay from the order of this

Court in CA (PHC) 178/2008 prior to filing this application.

It is also established law that suppression and/or misrepresentation of material

facts is a matter that a Court exercising Writ jurisdiction should consider in deciding

whether to intervene by way of judicial review (Alponso Appuhamy vs. Hettiarachchi

77 N.L.R. 131). The learned counsel for the 4lh_ 8th Respondents submits that the

Petitioner is guilty of suppression and lor misrepresentation of material facts in that

when referring to the order in LA 05/20 II-District Court, Kalutara reference is made

that the intervention of the Petitioners which was sought in that case was refused on

the basis of laches when in fact the judgment marked "P 12(a)" by the Petitioners

shows that the application was refused on the basis that the Petitioners in that case had

not established their pedigree.

The learned Senior State counsel further submitted that Section 57 of the Land

Acquisition Act gives an alternative remedy to the Petitioners if as claimed by them

compensation that is lawfully due to them are being paid to the 4th _8th Respondents

who according to the Petitioners are not lawfully entitled to such compensation.

The learned counsel for the 4th_8th Respondents further submitted that the final

order in District Court, Kalutara LA 05/2011 was delivered on 30104/2019 by which

the learned District Judge identified the entitlements of the parties before that Court to

the compensation payable for the land acquired by the State which order the Petitioner

intentionally kept away from this Court. He further submitted that being well aware

that the 4th _8~1 Respondents were the beneficiaries of the Section 17 order made under

the Land Acquisition Act, the Petitioners in this case sought in the first instance to

support the matter without making the 4th - 8th Respondents parties to this application.

Learned counsel for the 4th - 8th Respondents submits, that its only when two

parties sought to intervene in this case that the Petitioners brought in all four

respondents who are now identified as 4th_8th Respondents in this application.

Having considered the material and the submissions made by all counsel in this

case, this Court is of the view, that there is a merit in the submissions that there has

been delay and suppression and lor misrepresentation of material facts by the

Petitioner.

However, this Court is troubled by the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the Petitioner that the land acquired and the deeds produced by the parties

to whom compensation has been awarded in terms of "P 15" differ at least in relation

to two boundaries namely the North and South boundaries between the Section 38(a)

proviso order and the deeds.

5

Learned counsel for the Petitioner further submits that he has received

instructions from his clients that they intend to make a complaint to the Police on that

issue. In the event the Petitioner is correct it will mean that public funds are being

paid to a party who is not entitled in terms of the law for the said compensation.

Accordingly, this Court directs the Hon. Attorney General to consider whether

any offence has been disclosed in terms of any such complaint made by the Petitioner.

For the forgoing reasons, but subject to the direction made to the Hon.

Attorney General this Court refuses notice on grounds of delay, suppression and/or

misrepresentation of material facts and due to the Petitioners having an adequate and

efficacious remedy in terms of the law.

Notice refused. No costs.

Hon. Justice N. Bandula Karunarathna

I agree.
