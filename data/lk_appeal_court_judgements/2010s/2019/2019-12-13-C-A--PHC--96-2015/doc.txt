maintenance shall be supported by an affidavit stating the facts in support of the

application, and the Magistrate shall, if satisfied that the facts set out in the

the person against whom the application is made to appear and to show cause why

the application should not be granted:

Provided however the Magistrate may in his discretion at any time make an

interim order for the payment of monthly allowance which shall remain operative

until an order on the application is made, unless such interim order is earlier

Section 14(2) of the Act states as follows;

"(2) Any person dissatisfied with an order made by a High Court in the exercise of

its appellate jurisdiction under this section, may prefer an appeal therefrom to the

Supreme Court, on a question of law with the leave of the High Court, and where

such leave is refused, with the special leave of the Supreme Court, first had an

obtained. "

It is observed that instead of an appeal, the Appellant has filed a revision

application before the High Court to have the order of the learned Magistrate set

aside. The Appellant has failed to adduce reasons for doing so.

[n N.A. Romani Vs. K.S. Nagaratne, CA (PHC) 238102, K.T. Chitrasiri J.

held thus:

"Section 14 (2) of the Maintenance Act No. 3711999, stipulates that any person

dissatisfied with an order made by a High Court in the exercise of its appellate

jurisdictions may prefer an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court on a question

of law, with the leave of the High Court. " In view of the above provisions in law,

this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

"In terms of Section 14 (2) of the Maintenance Act, the appeals filed to challenge

the decision of a High Court Judge is to be preferred to the Supreme Court.

Therefore, having looked at Section 14 (2) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999,

we decide that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. " (W.A.

Ranasinghe Vs. Malanie Bemalaiha, CA (PBC) 14212002).

Accordingly, a person aggrieved by an order of the High Court exercising

appellate jurisdiction should prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court, in terms of

Section 14(2) of the Act. The Appellant instead of seeking special leave of the

Supreme Court or with the leave of the High Court, as provided in Section 14(2)

of the Act, has preferred an appeal to this Court. This Court has no jurisdiction to

entertain this appeal.

Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-.
