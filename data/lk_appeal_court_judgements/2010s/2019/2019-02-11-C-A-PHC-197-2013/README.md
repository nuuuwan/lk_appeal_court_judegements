Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratinapura dated 09.12.2013 in Case No.

HCRlRA/60/20 13 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the

Learned Magistrate of Balangoda dated ] 1. 1 0.20 13 in Case No. 40643/2012. At

the stage of inquiry, both parties agreed t::> abide by the written submissions which

were already filed.

Facts of the case:

; The complainant-respondent-respondent'. (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') had arrested above named two accused on or about 10.04.201 2 for

illegally transporting 'Mahogany timber' valued at Rs. 73737.93 . The accused

were charged before the Learned Magistrate of Balangoda under section 40, 40A,

40B and 52 read with section 25(2) of LIe Forest Ordinance (as amended). The

accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and the Learned Magistrate had convicted

them and imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000/= . Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held

with regard to the vehicle registered unde\' SG LB 3270 which was allegedly used

for the commission of offence. After . concluding the inquiry the Learned

, ~ . Magistrate of Balangoda confiscated the vehicle by order dated 11.10.2013.

Being aggrieved by the said order the vehicle c1aimant-petitioner-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant'" preferred a revision application to the

Provincial High Court of SabaragamuV\a Province holden in Rathnapura. On

09.12.2013, the Learned High Court Judge of Rathnapura dismissed the said

revision appl ication.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal t~le appellant preferred an appeal to this

Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has! submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence of the

appellant which goes to the root of the matter

2. The Learned High Court Judge ' has failed to apply the principle of

probability and improbability in deciding the matter in dispute

Page 4 " f 11

3. The Learned High Court Judge ha~' failed to consider that the appellant had

given specific instructions to the <lfxused not to use the vehicle for illegal

activities

4. The judgment dated 09.12.2013 is i lequitable in the facts and circumstances

of the action, and may cause irremediable damage and prejudice to the

appellant

5. The findings of the Learned High Court Judge are erroneous and contrary to

the weight of the evidence

It is well settled law that in a vehicle 11 quiry the claimant has to discharge his

burden on a balance of probability. ),ccording to section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance (as amended) it is mandatory 0 prove on a balance of probability that

the owner took every possible precaution to prevent the vehicle being used for an

illegal activity.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeall05A/2008], it was held that, .

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

of the said vehicle for the commissi 'In of the offence. The ratio decidendi of

all the aforementioned decisions al.so show that the owner has to establish

the said matter on a balance of probability. "

In the case of Manawadu V. The Attorney General (1987) 2 Sri L.R. 30, it was

held that,

Page 5 of 11

"By Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 198~ it was not intended to deprive an owner

of his vehicle used by the offenderJn committing a forest offence ' without

his (owner's) knowledge and withoW his participation. The word forfeited'

must be given the meaning 'liable t(:' be forfeited ' so as to avoid the injustice

that would flow on the construction ::that fOlfeiture of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the accused The amended sub-section 40 does not , exclude by necessary implication the rule of 'audi alteram partem' . The , owner of the lorry not a party to the case is entitled to be heard on the

question of fOlfeiture of the lorry, .f he satisfies the court that the accused

committed the offence without his kr10wiedge or participation, his lorry will

not be liable toforfeiture ... "

In the case of K.W.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura rCA (PHC) 89/2013], it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said oroviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate' to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance,

making use of that vehicle ... Nothing is forthcoming to show that he has

taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being committed by

using this vehicle though he was the person who had the power to exercise

control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore, it is evident that

no meaningful step had been takeN either by the owner or his power of

attorney holder, of the vehicle that was confiscated in order to prevent an

offence being committed by making use of this vehicle. "

Page 6 of 11

In light of the case law it is observed tl lat our Supreme COUli and the Court of

Appeal, in certain instances; had considdred the knowledge of the vehicle owner

, . about an offence being committed. HOWf:ver we are of the view that Court should

particularly look into the preventive me, sures taken by the vehicle owner whose

vehicle is involved in an offence under lorest Ordinance since it is now required

.' by the amendment made to the section , 0 of tHe Forest Ordinance in 2009. The

proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance (as amended by Act No.65 of

2009) reads that;

"Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in The commission of such offence, is a third

party, no Order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the

use of such tools, vehicles, implemf;nts, cattle and machines, as the case may

be, for the commission of the offence. "

Therefore it is understood that the Legislature has particularly stressed on the

preventive measures taken by a vehicle owner whose vehicle is involved in an

offence under the Forest Ordinance.

We perused the evidence given by the registered owner of the instant appeal

(appellant) at the vehicle inquiry. The appellant had handed over the vehicle to his

younger brother's son for hiring purposes and had instructed the driver to refrain

from using the vehicle for illegal transportations. Further the appellant had

admitted that he did not have time to :heck the vehicle frequently due to his

business. The appellant had testified in the vehicle inquiry as follows;

c: fflD" (Page 60 and 61 of the brief)

It demonstrates that the appellant was no in a position to regularly inquire about

his vehicle and he had no control over the ;ehicle.

The Learned sse for the respondent contended that the appellant stated in the

examination in chief that the vehicle would be parked at the accused 's place and

however during the cross examination he stated that the vehicle would be parked at

his place. The Learned sse further contended that since the appellant lied over the

matters whilst giving evidence, such evidence was not corroborated. Accordingly

we observe that the appellant had taken two different positions in the examination

in chief and cross examination (Page 56 :and 62 of the brief). We further observe

that the appellant had only given instructions to the accused not to use the vehicle

for illegal activities.

However in the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva ICA (PHC) 86/971,

it was held that,

"For these reasons J hold that giving mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she tock every endeavor to implement the

instructions ... "

In light of the above it is amply clear that ~ii mply giving instructions to the driver is

insufficient to discharge the burden caston a vehicle owner. Therefore merely

Page 8 ')f 11

giving instructions alone will not fall unde; the possible preventive measures ought

to be taken by a vehicle owner.

The appellant, in the petition submitted to' the High Court, has contended that the

Learned Magistrate of Balangoda has contjscated the vehicle after an inquiry that

was not conducted according to the proper procedure. However the Learned

Counsel for the appellant neither in the High Court nor in this Court has explained

what was the exact irregularity in thf procedure adopted by the Learned

Magistrate.

rn the case of Orient Financial Service,,} Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another rSC Appeal No. 12012011), it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistentl:y followed the case of Manawadu vs the

A ttorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause,

If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was

committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner, "

We observe that the Learned Magistrate had cited the aforesaid Manawadu case

(supra) in the order dated Il.l 0.2013 ar d correctly followed the principles of

" natural justice by allowing the appellant to show cause in a vehicle inquiry.

Accordingly we find that the Learned Magistrate had followed the right procedure.

It is trite law that the revisionary power of Court shall be invoked only upon the

demonstration of exceptional circumstances. This position was upheld in following

series of authorities;

Page 9 uf 11

In the case of Bank of Ct:ylon V. Kaleel: Ild others 120041 I Sri L.R. 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionar~ jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justicE and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order conplained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. Jfi such a selection process is not there

revisionGlY jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal... "

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali and others (1981) 2 SLR 29, it was

held that,

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the cQurt ... "

These authorities manifest that it is mandatory to demonstrate the existence of

exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of Court in order to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction. We observe that the appellant has failed to establish

Page 10 'of 11

exceptional circumstances to the satisfal tion of the High Court and therefore the

Learned High Court Judge was con'ect in refusing to interfere with the confiscation

order made by the Learned Magistrate of Balangoda.

Considering above, we see no reason t6 interfere with the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Rathnapura dated 09.12.2013 and the confiscation order of

the Learned Magistrate of Balangoda dated 11.10.2013. Therefore we affirm the

same,

The appeal is hereby dismissed without CJsts.
