Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Manoli Jinadasa for the Petitioner.

S.H.A. Mohamed for the 1st Respondent.

Decided on: 13.02.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari

quashing the award (P10) made by the 3rd respondent arbitrator

granting reliefs to the 1st respondent workman upon a reference

of arbitration made by the 4th respondent Minister of Labour in

terms of section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of

1950, as amended.

3

The dispute referred to was to consider whether the suspension

of services of the 1st respondent by the petitioner effective from

02.04.1998 is unjustifiable, and, if it is, what reliefs he shall be

entitled to.

There cannot be any dispute that the 1st respondent had a poor

past record of service and had been inter alia suspended

previously on several occasions.

He was, according to the petitioner, transferred on

administrative reasons and not as a punishment, from the

Middle Division of the estate to the Lower Division effective from

01.11.1997.1 He did not report for work at the Lower Division

and instead filed an application in the Labour Tribunal alleging

constructive termination of his services.

At the Labour Tribunal, the matter was settled on 23.02.1998 on

the following terms:

(a) The petitioner agrees to provide the 1st respondent with

work from 23.02.1998 in the Lower Division without a

break in service. However, he is not entitled to back

wages, but is, to holiday pay and incentives.

(b) The 1st respondent shall hand over the quarters he is

presently occupying (in the Middle Division) to the

Superintendent before 28.02.1998 and shall move to the

new quarters (in the Lower Division) provided to him.

1 Vide X6-A6.

4

(c) The 1st respondent shall be paid Rs.8000/= as an ex

gratia payment on or before 10.03.1998.2

Admittedly, the petitioner fulfilled his part of obligations in

respect of (a) and (c) above on or before the due dates, but the

1st respondent did not do his part, i.e. (b) above, believe it or not,

up to nownearly 21 years from the date he was supposed to

handover the quarters.

It is significant to note that, in the aforesaid Labour Tribunal

settlement/order, the handing over of the Middle Division

quarters and moving to the Lower Division quarters before

28.02.1998 was not subject to any condition. If there were such

conditions which the parties were very serious of, they could

have been incorporated in the settlement/order.

However, the 1st respondent after this settlement/order sent a

letter dated 24.02.1998 to the petitioner demanding that new

quarters in the Lower Division be repaired as specified in that

letter for him to go into occupation.3

The petitioner has thereafter completed all the repairs by

28.03.1998 and informed the 1st respondent to move into the

new quarters on 01.04.1998.4 But the 1st respondent did not do

it because, according to the 1st respondent, although the

quarters is completely repaired, the quarters is still lacking the

necessary furniture.5

2 Vide X6-A9. 3 Vide X6-A10. 4 Vide X6-A11. 5 Vide X6-A12.

5

It is clear by then that the 1st respondent was not prepared to

move into the Lower Division quarters, and hence the petitioner

has sent the letter dated 02.04.1998 suspending the services of

the 1st respondent with immediate effect until you shift into the

Lower Division quarters provided to you, along with the furniture

of your present quarters on the Middle Division.

The 1st respondent neither handed over the Middle Division

quarters nor shifted to the Lower Division quarters, if he says

that inadequate furniture is the issue, with the furniture in the

quarters which he is presently in occupation. Surely, he cannot

expect more or better furniture in the new quarters than he was

using in the old quarters, particularly when both the quarters

are of the same type.6

Thereafter the Labour Department has made several attempts to

settle the matter and as they were unsuccessful, the Labour

Commissioner has closed the file on 10.09.2007.7

When matters remained as such, it is baffling to learn that the

4th respondent has again referred the matter unknown to the

petitioner for arbitration in 2011.8 It is pursuant to that inquiry

the arbitration award P10, which is being challenged in these

proceedings, was made.

There is no dispute that the suspension of the 1st respondent

came into being as a result of the defiance of the 1st respondent

to hand over the Middle Division quarters and shift to the Lower

6 Vide Labour Officers Report marked X6-A15. 7 Vide X7-R17. 8 Vide X2.

6

Division quarters firstly as agreed before the Labour Tribunal by

28.02.1998 and secondly as directed by the petitioner by

01.04.1998.

The 3rd respondent in the award says that the management

failed to provide a suitable quarters and pay the salary (during

suspension). This he says, if I understand correctly,

predominantly on the Labour Officers Report dated 19.11.20039

and the clauses 17 and 18 of the Collective Agreement.10

In the first place, is the 1st respondent entitled to quarters? In

terms of the appointment letter, under Quarters, it is stated

that: Quarters if and when provided are incidental to your

appointment11, which means, the 1st respondent cannot

demand quarters as an entitlement.

The 3rd respondent in his award has taken up the position that,

according to the Report of the Labour Officer, the quarters were

of sub-standard. The 3rd respondent has misdirected himself

on facts on that point. Sub-standard when? The Labour

Officer has compiled his Report based on the condition prevailed

when he visited the place on 17.11.2003 and not on the

condition prevailed when the 1st respondent was supposed to

shift to the Lower Division quarters on 01.04.1998 at the latest.

That means, more than five years have lapsed in between and

therefore it is quite natural the surrounding area of the quarters

as the Labour Officer has observed being overrun with weeds as

nobody was living there. According to that Report the 1st

9 Vide X6-A15. 10 Vide X6-A25. 11 Vide X6-A1 and X6-A2.

7

respondent has admitted the quarters being renovated by the

petitioner (after the Labour Tribunal settlement).

The 3rd respondent says that the new quarters offered had no

water and toilet facilities. According to the Labour Officers

Report, water facility was not there when he went for the

inspection, but the officer immediately thereafter mentions that

there is evidence to confirm that water facility was there 5-6

years ago. That means, by the time the 1st respondent was

supposed to move to the said quarters, water connection had

been given. The explanation of the petitioner that, these being

estate quarters, the management disconnects water facility in

quarters which are unoccupied to avoid water being misused by

other workers is acceptable.

Regarding toilet facilities, the 3rd respondents finding that there

are no toilet facilities in the new quarters is incorrect. According

to the Labour Officers Report, in the Middle Division quarters

which the 1st respondent was earlier in occupation, the toilet

was separated and not attached; but in the Lower Division

quarters, the toilet is attached to the quarters. That means, the

Lower Division quarters has better toilet facilities. Both toilets,

according to the Report, have no doors.

The Labour Officer in his report has finally stated that more

suitable quarters for an Assistant Field Officer such as the 1st

respondent is the Lower Division quarters.

There is another important matter to be mentioned regarding

occupation of quarters. That is, after the services of the 1st

respondent were suspended until he hands over the old

8

quarters, the petitioner, instead of complying with it, had,

admittedly, got some other labourers to occupy the old quarters

on his behalf and left the old quarters.12 This arrogant behavior

of the 1st respondent, to say the least, is intolerable and

completely unwarranted. He has no right whatsoever to give the

staff quarters to labourers to occupy. But the 3rd respondent in

his award to my dismay has considered this matter also in

favour of the 1st respondent when he says that During the

period of interdiction, applicant (the 1st respondent to this

application) had given the quarters to a trusted person to look

after who was working in the estate and once in a way he visited

the house. The 1st respondent does not want the quarters nor

does he want to hand it over to the management. Can an estate

with a large number of labour force run in this fashion?

The 3rd respondent in the award has quoted section 2 of the

Estates Quarters (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1971. It has

no application to the present case as that section deals with the

subject of Period during which the right to occupy quarters

subsists after the termination of employees services. As the

learned counsel for the 1st respondent admits the services of the

1st respondent were never terminated.13

The 3rd respondent has quoted clauses 16 and 17 of the

Collective Agreement14 may be to show that indefinite

suspension without inquiry and without pay is in contravention

12 Vide paragraphs 10-11 of the replication of the 1st respondent dated 22.10.2012 marked X4(a), and the Labour Officers Report marked X6-A15. 13 Vide paragraph 29 of the written submissions dated 13.09.2018. 14 Vide X6-A24.

9

of the Collective Agreement. It appears that what he meant was

clauses 17 and 18 (not 16 and 17).

Clauses 17 and 18 read as follows:

17. SUSPENSION AS A MEASURE OF PUNISHMENT

1. Punishment for offences in the case of an employee may

include suspension, provided however that such suspension

shall not exceed fourteen days without pay and shall be in

writing.

2. Punishment in excess of three days suspension without pay

shall only be after a domestic inquiry. Such suspension shall

be in writing.

18. SUSPENSION PENDING DISCIPLINARY INQUIRIES

1. An employee may be suspended from work without pay for a

period not exceeding one month pending a disciplinary inquiry

when there is prima facie evidence, in the opinion of the

employer, of a charge or charges of misconduct against him.

2. Suspension of an employee on the ground referred to in sub-

clause (1) above for any period in excess of one month shall be

on half pay.

3. The provisions contained in sub-clauses (1) and (2) above

shall not apply to the suspension of an employee pending

inquiries by the police, by other public authorities or audit

verifications.

10

Application of clauses 17 and 18 of the Collective Agreement to

the facts of this case is completely a misdirection as the

suspension of the 1st respondent is neither as a measure of

punishment nor pending disciplinary inquiries as contemplated

in those two clauses.

This is not the first time a workmans services have been

suspended pending the handing over the quarters. There is a

practice in the plantation sector to suspend workmen from work

who forcibly occupying the quarters without handing them over

when they are transferred within service. This practice has been

acknowledged by the superior Courts in this country. The

suspension in such circumstances, is neither a punishment nor

a step taken pending a disciplinary inquiry, but is an

administrative mechanism effectively implemented to take back

the old quarters in order to be given to the successor and to

induce the workman to shift to the new quarters without delay.

It is true that the initial suspension is by the employer, but

whether it shall be kept alive indefinitely or set at naught

instantly is entirely in the hands of the workman and not the

employer. If he wants, he can shift to the new quarters and lift

the suspension immediately. Otherwise, he can refuse to shift

to the new quarters and keep the suspension in operation until

his retirement. Hence the pivotal argument of the learned

counsel for the 1st respondent that the indefinite suspension

without an inquiry and without pay is contrary to clauses 17

and 18 of the Collective Agreement is absolutely no merit. There

is no indefinite suspension. There is no follow up inquiry either.

Indefinite suspension, if at all, is something created not by the

employer, but by the employee himself.

11

Ceylon Workers Congress v. Janatha Estates Development

Board15 is a similar case where a workman continued in forcible

occupation of a line room in defiance of the orders of the

Superintendent to get back to the line room earlier occupied by

him. The Superintendent thereupon suspended him from work

until he vacated the line room being forcibly occupied by him.

The Supreme Court held that:

The suspension from work did not amount to constructive

termination. In the face of the clear manifestation of the

workmen's intention not to vacate the line room there was

no purpose in holding a domestic inquiry. The application

under S.31 (B) (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act is not

sustainable.

Atukorale J. at pages 76-77 observed:

He (the workman) appears to have acknowledged that the

allocation of line rooms in the estate is one that appertains

to the internal arrangement of the estate and is a matter

within the control and discretion of its management. Unless

the terms of employment provide otherwise there can be no

legal foundation for a workman's claim to remain in

occupation of a particular line room in defiance of an order

of the management made in good faith. It is worthy of note

that in the instant case both line rooms were located in the

same division of the estate. The right of the management to

transfer a workman from one place of residence to another

in the same estate and the corresponding liability of the

15 [1987] 2 Sri LR 73

12

workman to be so transferred is incidental to and an

implied condition of the workman's service. In my view it is

absolutely essential that the management should be

possessed of such a right and should have control over the

allocation of line rooms for the purposes of efficient and

proper administration of the estate with a view to achieving

maximum productivity. In The Ceylon Estates Staffs Union

v. The Superintendent, Meddecombra Estate, Watagoda

(1970) 73 NLR 278 this court recognised the legal right of

an employer to transfer his staff from one place of work to

another within his service subject to certain limitations

which do not arise for consideration in the instant case. If

so it must necessarily follow that an employer has the right

to transfer his workman from one place of residence to

another within his service. No doubt it would be open to

such a workman to make representations to the appropriate

authorities against the transfer but he cannot, in my view,

be permitted to set the employer at defiance by blatantly

refusing to comply with the order as in the instant case. The

failure or refusal of the workman to comply with such an

order amounts to a disobedience of the lawful order of his

employer and constitutes by itself misconduct on the part of

the workman. There is no necessity in such circumstances

for the employer to go through the formal process of holding

a domestic inquiry for ascertaining whether there has been

on the part of the workman a refusal to carry out the

employer's order of transfer. The conduct of the workman in

continuing to remain in occupation of the line room in

question from 21.9.1978 clearly manifested his intention

13

not to obey the transfer order. His refusal was so obvious

that there was no purpose in holding a domestic inquiry.

The facts in Superintendent, Abbotsleigh Group v. Estate Services

Union16 are on all fours with those of the instant case. In this

case the workmans services were suspended when he did not

comply with the order given by the Superintendent, to act in

terms of the settlement entered into in a Labour Tribunal case,

and vacate the quarters given to the workman in one division of

the estate and occupy quarters in another division. The

workman refused to occupy the quarters allocated to him in the

other division, as he alleged that some of the necessary repairs

were not effected, as undertaken by the employer before the

Labour Tribunal.

It may be recalled that in the instant case before me there was

no undertaking given to the Labour Tribunal by the employer to

do necessary repairs as seen from the recorded settlement

referred to above. To that extent the facts in Abbotsleigh Group

case are more favourable to the employee. Nevertheless, this

Court held against the employee on the following basis:

1. That the two grounds urged by the workman to assert

that his services have been constructively terminated, do

not directly relate to the duties he has to perform as

Plucking Kanakapullai, or to his salary and emoluments.

What is disputed is, the degree of suitability of the

quarters provided for occupation of the workman, and

not that quarters were not provided at all. In such a

16 [1991] 1 Sri LR 380

14

situation it would not be appropriate to infer that there

had been a constructive termination of services.

2. That ordinarily what suspension of work would mean, is

that the employer caused a cessation of work of the

workman, temporarily, till such time a term or condition

is observed or adjusted.

3. That interdiction cannot be considered as termination of

services either directly or constructively, in the given

circumstances.

For the aforesaid reasons it is clear that the basis upon which

the 3rd respondent made the award in favour of the 1st

respondent is erroneous both on fact and on law.

There is a misconception that even if an administrative or

judicial decision is patently erroneous, writ of certiorari does not

lie, if the decision-making process was flawless, and the deciding

authority has erred on facts and not on law. Accordingly, it is

thought that, error on facts by the decision maker, however

much it is obvious, is not a ground to quash the decision by

certiorari.

Whilst conceding that the jurisdiction to issue writs vested in

this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution is supervisory and

not appellate, I must state that error of law on the face of the

record, which is a well-accepted ground for certiorari, can be

made use of to quash erroneous administrative or judicial

decisions notwithstanding the decision-making process was

flawless. For example, if the deciding authority has manifestly

failed to properly evaluate the evidence led before him, the

15

decision can be quashed on the ground of error of law on the

face of the record.

It is important to understand that an error of fact can also be an

error of law.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v. Nestle

Lanka Limited17 Jayasuriya J. explained:

In R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunalex

parte Shaw 1951 1 KB 711 (Affirmed in 1952 1 KB 338),

the Divisional Court of the Kings Bench Division held that

certiorari would issue to quash the decision of a statutory

administration tribunal for an error of law on the face of the

record, even though that tribunal was not a court of record

and although that error did not go to the jurisdiction of the

tribunal. This decision pronounced by Lord Denning

appeased at least to a certain extent, the public demand for

better justice in the welfare state and it marked the

commencement of a new era of judicial review.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union case

(supra) the petitioner sought to quash the award made by the

arbitrator wherein he has held that the termination was

justifiable. Quashing the award by way of certiorari on the

ground of an error on the face of the record this Court held that:

1. Although Arbitrator does not exercise judicial power in

the strict sense, it is his duty to act judicially, though

17 [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 at 350

16

ultimately he makes an award as may appear to him to

be just and equitable.

2. There is no evidence or material which could support the

findings reached by the Arbitrator, findings and

decisions unsupported by evidence are capricious,

unreasonable or arbitrary.

3. A deciding authority which has made a finding of

primary fact wholly unsupported by evidence or which

has drawn an inference wholly unsupported by any of

the primary facts found by it will be held to have erred

in point of law.

4. No evidence rule does not contemplate a total lack of

evidence it is equally applicable where the evidence

taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of

supporting the finding or decision.

In Collettes Ltd. v. Bank of Ceylon18, a Divisional Bench of the

Supreme Court held that Where there is or is not evidence to

support a finding, is a question of law. It was also held in the

same case that Given the primary facts, the question whether the

tribunal rightly exercised its discretion is a question of law.

It was held in Sithamparanathan v. People's Bank19 that Failure

to properly evaluate evidence or to take into account relevant

considerations in such evaluation is a question of law.

A similar conclusion was reached in Fonseka v. Candappa20

where it was decided that:

18 [1982] 2 Sri LR 514 19 [1989] 1 Sri LR 124

17

It becomes a question of law where relevant evidence

bearing on a fact has not been considered or irrelevant

matters have been given undue importance or the

conclusions rest mainly on erroneous considerations or is

not supported by sufficient evidence.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour21 where the

order of the Commissioner of Labour was sought to be quashed

by way of certiorari, the Supreme Court held that:

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While

engaged on a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from

the rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong

questions or may take into account matters which it was

not directed to take into account. Thereby it would step

outside its jurisdiction. A tribunal which has made findings

of fact wholly unsupported by evidence or which it has

drawn inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts

found by it will be held to have erred in point of law. The

concept of error of law includes the giving of reasons that

are bad in law or inconsistent, unintelligible or it would

seem substantially inadequate. It includes also the

application of a wrong legal test to the facts found taking

irrelevant considerations into account and arriving at a

conclusion without any supporting evidence. If reasons are

given and these disclose that an erroneous legal approach

has been followed the superior Court can set the decision

aside by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record.

20 [1988] 2 Sri LR 11 21 (1978) 79(2) NLR 409 at 426

18

If the grounds or reasons stated disclose a clearly

erroneous legal approach the decision will be quashed. An

error of law may also be held to be apparent on the face of

the record if the inferences and decisions reached by the

tribunal in any given case are such as no reasonable body

of persons properly instructed in the law applicable to the

case could have made.

In Health & Co (Ceylon) Ltd v. Kariyawasam22 the decision of the

arbitrator was quashed by way of certiorari on the basis that:

No reasonable man could have...reached that conclusion on

the evidence placed before him. The finding here is so

completely contrary to the weight of evidence that one can

only describe it as perverse.

Conclusion was similar in Wijerama v. Paul23 where the decision

was quashed by certiorari inter alia on the premise that:

A tribunal which draws an inference wholly unsupported

by the primary facts errs in point of law.

In Virakesari Ltd v. Fernando24 is yet another case where an

application for certiorari was allowed inter alia when it was

found that:

The omission of the first respondent to take into

consideration the evidence touching the charge of having

22 (1968) 71 NLR 382 at 384 23 (1973) 76 NLR 241 at 258 24 (1963) 66 NLR 145 at 150-151

19

instigated a go-slow is....a misdirection amounting to an

error of law on the face of the record.

In Mudanayake v. Sivagnanasunderam25 the decision was not

allowed to stand as it was the opinion of the Court that:

Certiorari lies not only where the inferior Court has acted

without or in excess of its jurisdiction but also where the

inferior Court has stated on the face of the order the

grounds on which it had made it and it appears that in law

those grounds are not such as to warrant the decision to

which it had come.

In Chas Hayley and Co. Ltd., v. Commercial and Industrial

Workers26 Senanayake J. held that:

It is well settled that the order of an inferior tribunal having

a duty to act reasonably in determining the rights of the

parties is liable to be quashed by Writ of Certiorari for an

error of law appearing on the face of the record. A finding of

fact may be impugned on the ground of error of law on the

face of the record (a) erroneously refusing to admit

admissible material evidence (b) erroneously admitting

inadmissible evidence which influence the finding (c) finding

of based on no evidence (d) where the tribunal had acted

with manifest or clear unreasonableness or unfairness. The

misconstruction of the document becomes an error on the

face of the record.

25 (1951) 53 NLR 25 at 31 26 [1995] 2 Sri LR 42 at 49-50

20

I am of the view that the Arbitrator had misconstrued the

document R16b when he failed to consider that the loss

depicted in the Report and speculated on the fact that it

was temporary without any evidence. There was no

evidence for such a finding. This was unreasonable and

unfair. The evidence revealed that the employees were

getting a higher wage than prescribed by the Wages Board

Ordinance. They were paid more than the other competitors

in the Trade. The Arbitrator failed to consider the heavy

financial loss and had acted unreasonably and unfairly in

granting 30 percent increase in wages with a 10% increase

in productivity was an error of law on the face of the record.

In the circumstances, I quash the award of the 2nd

Respondent by granting a writ of Certiorari.

The term an error of law on the face of the record was given a

broader meaning in Gunadasa v. Attorney-General27 in the

following manner:

That the failure to give the petitioner a fair opportunity to

correct or contradict the material witnesses when they

gave evidence, has occasioned a violation of the principles

of natural justice; that a man's defence must always be

fairly heard. The non-observance of the said principles of

natural justice, would consequently amount to an error on

the face of the record, which would attract the remedy of

Writ of Certiorari.

27 [1989] 2 Sri LR 130

21

The failure to make available the documents relevant to the

defence of the petitioner, at the hearing, amounted to an

error on the face of the record, and the Writ of Certiorari

would lie in such situations also.

In Health & Co. (Ceylon) Ltd., v. Kariyawasam28 it was held that:

In the assessment of evidence, an arbitrator appointed

under the Industrial Disputes Act must act judicially. Where

his finding is completely contrary to the weight of evidence,

his award is liable to be quashed by way of certiorari.

In a labour dispute, the misconduct of a workman must not

be condoned in the name of industrial peace, if such

condonation can only lead to industrial chaos.

For the aforesaid reasons, I quash the award (P10) made by the

3rd respondent arbitrator by way of certiorari on the ground of

error of law on the face of the record and allow the application

of the petitioner with costs.
