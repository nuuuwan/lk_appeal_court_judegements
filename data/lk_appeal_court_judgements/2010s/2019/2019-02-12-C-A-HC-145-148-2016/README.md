ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The four Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

/I Appellants") were indicted before the High Court of Jaffna for

committing gang rape on Naguleswaran Jonista on 21st July 2009, an offence

punishable under Section 364(2)(g) of the Penal Code as amended.

At the conclusion of their trial without a jury, the Appellants were

convicted by the High Court as charged and were accordingly sentenced

each of them to serve a fifteen-year term of imprisonment. They were also

fined a sum of Rs. 25,000.00 with a default sentence of 2 years.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellants

have challenged its validity on the basis that;

2

a. there has been a noncompliance of the mandatory statutory

provisions relating to matters which are triable before the High

Court as set out in Sections 150, 151 and 152 read with Section

199(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 0.1979,

b. there is no record whatsoever of any Court Official gIvmg

evidence at the trial to confirm due compliance of the relevant

mandatory provisions,

c. the trial Court has failed to attach any material significance to

this omission at any stage of the trial or in its judgment.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants contended that the

noncompliance of the mandatory statutory provisions would necessarily

vitiate the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellants.

In response to the ground of appeal and the submissions in support

of it, learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondent, conceded to " .. . the

fact that aforesaid statements have neither been recorded during the NS

proceedings nor being adduced in evidence during the trial in the High Court".

However, the Respondent contended that such failure had not caused any

prejudice or occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice to the

Appellants in the instant appeal.

Learned Senior State Counsel relied upon the Article 138 of the

Constitution, Section 456A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 in support of his contention and also relied upon the unreported

judgment of Ibrahim v Attorney General in CA 115/2014 decided on

3

.. , 29.05.2017 where it had been held that the failure to adduce the statutory

statement before the High Court by the prosecution "had not caused any

prejudice to the appellant or miscarriage of justice".

In order to strengthen the claim that the failure to comply with the

mandatory provisions contained in Sections 150, 151, 152, 154 and 199(3)

caused no miscarriage of justice to the Appellants, learned Senior State

Counsel relied on the definition of the said term as provided in the Black's

Law Dictionary and with the amendments effected by the Criminal

Procedure Code (Special Provisions) Act No. 15 of 2005 where the purpose

of the" statutory statement" is to establish the consistency of the accused's

willingness to plead guilty to a lesser offence.

Since the Appellants of the instant appeal were indicted before the

High Court for committing the offence of "gang rape", the Respondent

submitted that their willingness to accept liability to lesser culpability does

not arise at all.

The Respondent has also relied on the judgments of Atapattu v

Punchi Banda 40 N.L.R. 169, Jayantha v Officer-in-Charge, Panadura

Police Station (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 334, Banwari v State of Uttar Pradesh AIR

1962 SC 1198 and Sing v State of Bihar AIR 2004 SC 4421 to impress upon

this Court to the situations where the irregularities that were complained

of by the respective appellants in those appeals were considered as

irregularities that have not occasioned a failure of justice.

Since the Respondent conceded that the mandatory provisions of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act contained in Sections 150, 151, 152 and

Section 199(3), were not complied with, at the Magistrate's Court as well as

4

at the High Court and therefore moves this Court to act under the proviso

to Article 138 of the Constitution and Section 436 of Act No. 15 of 1979, it is

appropriate that this Court considers the submissions of the parties in the

light of the judicial precedents to decide whether this is a fit case to apply

said provisions of law, despite the admitted noncompliance of mandatory

statutory provisions.

Author Reginald Dias, in his Commentary on the Ceylon Criminal

Procedure Code quotes ( at Vol. 1 p. 628) the judgments of Punchirala v

Punchibanda 3 N.L.R. 38 and Hamiappu v Babaappu 1 S.c.R. 120, where it

has been held /I in criminal cases unlike a civil suit, the rules of procedure

cannot be departed from even with the consent of the parties."

Before this Court ventures to consider the legal submissions of the

parties on the applicability of the proviso to Article 138 and Section 436 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, it is prudent to

examine the extent of noncompliance, which is in fact the fundamental

issue before us.

The Appellants were charged before the Magistrate's Court of

Chavakachcheri under Sections 357 and 364(2) (g) of the Penal Code as

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 upon advice by the Hon. Attorney General

and the inquiry commenced on 26.06.2014 after the charge was read over

to them as per page 511 of the original case record.

On 24.04.2015, the Magistrate's Court made the following order (as

per the translated brief at p. 532);

"Based on the evidence led and the productions marked

during the trial of this case, prima facie case has been proved

5

against the accused and Registrar to act according to the

provisions of Section 159 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

If

Journal entry of 24.04.2015 contains, among other entries, an entry

made in English to the effect that" CI s committed to HI C" .

Thus, it is clear that the case against the Appellants were committed

before the High Court by the learned Magistrate who held the preliminary

inquiry under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special

Provisions) Act No.2 of 2013 and he clearly did not intend to act under the

provisions of Section 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979. He has then directed the Registrar to explain the charge against the

Appellants.

It could well be that the Registrar may have acted upon the direction

of Court and since there was no statement made by any of the Appellants,

no record of that fact was made. However, that is not the only inference

one could draw under these circumstances. The resultant position is that

there are no further proceedings available in the case record to denote

compliance with the directive of the learned Magistrate on the Registrar to

comply with Section 159.

At the close of the prosecution case before the High Court of Jaffna,

learned State Counsel tendered the oral evidence and documents marked

as P1 to P6 in support. No statutory statement of any accused was marked

by the prosecution at that time.

6

All four Appellants gave evidence under oath and some of them

have called witnesses on their behalf. They denied the allegation of rape

and claimed that all they knew was that the prosecutrix went missing that

night and was later found in a building nearby.

Therefore, it is incumbent for this Court to consider the all-

important issues whether the substantial rights of the Appellants were

prejudiced or whether there was a failure of justice resulted in due to the

noncompliance of the mandatory provisions contained in Sections

149,150,151 and 152 and 199(3) by the prosecution?

The first ground of appeal of the Appellants is that the prosecution

has acted in violation of the mandatory provisions contained in Section

199(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979, which

imposes a requirement that" All statements of the accused recorded in the

course of the inquiry in the Magistrate's Court, if there had been one, shall be

put in and read in evidence before the close of the case for the prosecution."

(emphasis added)

The presence of the word" shall" no doubt, generally, means that the

provisions are imperative in nature and therefore its compliance is

mandatory.

Section 233 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898, which was later

replaced by Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, imposes a duty

on the prosecution to tender the statutory statement of the accused before

close of its case before the High Court, as it states as follows:-

7

"All statements of the accused recorded in the course of the inquiry

in the Magistrate's Court shall be put in and read in evidence before

the close of the case for the prosecution."

The Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973 which is the

immediate predecessor to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 had no such provision to conduct non-summary inquiries before the

Magistrate's Courts and in fact it had abolished the conduct of such

inquiries with the operation of the proviso to its Section 53(4).

Dias, states ( at Vol. 2 p. 777) that" ... the trial subsequent to the inquiry

at which the accused gave His answers is concerned, such answers must be put in

as part of the case for prosecution, whether such evidence inculpates or exculpates

the accused."

He traces the origin of this requirement to the old English Criminal

Procedure Code under which the practice of interrogation of prisoners

continued, but was discarded after the" famous trial of Eugene Aram held

in 1759."

In view of the statutory provisions contained in Section 199(3) all

statements of the accused recorded during the non-summary inquiry

"shall be" put in and read in evidence before close of the prosecution.

Plain reading of the said Section reveals that the wordings are clear as it

had clearly imposed a mandatory obligation on the prosecution to present

"all statements" recorded of the accused to be put in and read in evidence.

This duty is a continuation from Section 233 of the Criminal Procedure

Code.

8

However, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal

Appeal, in Regina v Arthur Perera 57 N.L.R. 313, Basnayake A.C.J. (as he

was then), with the agreement of Pulle and Weerasooriya H, has stated

that" ... we are of the opinion that the expression "all statements" in. section 233

of the Code means all statements of an accused, other than his evidence recorded

under section 161, for the recording of which express provision is contained in

Chapter XV!." (emphasis added). Section 152 of the Act No . 15 of 1979 is

identical with Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This view was

in fact endorsed and acted upon by the Supreme Court in Sheela

Sinharage v The Attorne~ General (1985) 1 Sri L.R. 1 at p.18.

Section 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is

identical to Section 233 of the Criminal Procedure Code, except for the

phrase "if there had been one" and therefore the reasoning in Regina v

Arthur Perera is applicable. The additional phrase "if there had been one"

refers to a preliminary inquiry and this could well be due to the fact that

there were no such inquiries during the operation of Administration of

Justice Law, which governed the criminal Courts prior to the enactment of

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

In reply to this ground of appeal of the Appellant, the Respondent

relied on the judgment of Ibrahim Janap v The Attorney General (C.A.

115/2014 - decided on 29th May 2017) where it was held that " ... the

appellants have not suffered any prejudice due to non-marking of statutory

statement during high court trial ... the appellant failed to satisfy court that he

was prejudiced by this omission and thereby caused a failure of justice .. . ".

9

Returning to appeal before us, we hold that even if there is a

statement recorded under Section 152(2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, the judgment of Regina v Arthur Perera prevents the

prosecution from tendering such statement during its case before the High

Court. Under these circumstances whether there is a statutory statement in

existence or not that fact would not make any difference in this regard.

In view of this clear pronouncement by the divisional bench of the

Court of Criminal Appeal, the first ground of appeal of the Appellants

fails.

At this juncture, we turn our attention to consider the second

ground of appeal raised by the Appellants in the light of the submissions

of the learned Senior State Counsel since it is necessary to decide whether

the failure to comply with the mandatory statutory provisions contained in

Sections 150, 151 and 152 has occasioned a failure of justice in relation to

the Appellants.

In this regard, it is prudent to trace back the Legislative history of

this particular set of provisions in order to have a clear appreciation of its

intended purpose in preliminary inquiries.

Section 150 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act also imposes a

duty on the inquiring Magistrate to read out the charge to the accused and

to explain that he has the right to call and give evidence on his behalf.

Section 151 has spelt out the caution that should be administered on the

accused that whatever he says will be taken down and put in his trial as

evidence. Section 152 lays down the manner in which the evidence for the

10

accused is recorded if the accused elects to give evidence and or calls

witnesses on his behalf.

It is to be noted at this stage that the procedure of conducting

preliminary inquiries by the Magistrate remained almost the 'same even

under Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. However,

recognising the practical realities and the negative factors that had

adversely affected the due administration of criminal justice system, the

Legislature thought it is opportune to intervene to bring about some

remedial measures to address the problems faced by the accused,

witnesses and the Courts.

With the enactment of Code of Criminal Procedure (Special

Provisions) Act No. 15 of 2005, the Legislature has introduced a new

procedural laws governing the conduct of preliminary inquiries by

introducing substantial changes which are more progressive in nature. In

the preamble to the said Act it is declared that inter alia " ... FOR

DISPENSING WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE NON SUMMARY

INQUIRY IN CERTAIN CASES/'. The Act, in its Section 3(1) has conferred

authority on the Attorney General to forward indictments directly to the

High Court in respect of offences that are specified in the second schedule

to the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 if there are "aggravating circumstances"

or " circumstances that give rise to public disquiet" thereby bypassing the

procedure contained in Chapter XV of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act.

Section 6(14) of the said Act contained statutory provisions that are

in effect similar to the provisions of Section 150 of the Code of Criminal

11

Procedure Act in imposing a duty on the Magistrate to readout the charge

and explain to the accused that he has a right to call witnesses and if he so

desires to give evidence on his behalf.

In addition, the said Act, in Section 15 it is stated that "The

provisions of Chapter XV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 shall mutatis mutandis apply to any preliminary inquiry held under

the provisions of this Act."

The Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 15 of

2005 was initially enacted for a limited period of two years and was

replaced by Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 42 of

2007 and thereafter by Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions)

Act No.2 of 2013.

Considering the Legislative history and the collective scheme of the

relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Code of

Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act it appears that these

provisions facilitated an accused to present his version of events to the

offence he was charged with by offering evidence by himself or calling

witnesses. There are specific provisions contained in Section 151 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, to safeguard the accused's interests since

his evidence" ... will be taken down in writing and put in evidence" at his trial.

Dias (Vol.2 p.805) identified four sets of circumstances under which

an accused may make statements in a non-summery inquiry. He lists them

as follows:-

12

i. at the commencement of the investigation under Section

155(1)

11. at the close of the prosecution case under Section 295

iii. at any stage under Section 295(1)

IV. if the accused volunteers any further statement at any stage

under Section 302.

The purpose of recording a statement under Section 295 was

considered by the full bench of the then Supreme Court, in its decision of

The King v Sittambaram 20 N.L.R. 257, where Bertram C.J. has held that:-

. "It is open to the Attorney-General, if he thinks such a

course appropriate, to instruct the Police Magistrate before

committing a case for trial to explain to the accused the

nature of any offence on which he contemplates indicting

him, and to afford him an opportunity of making any

statement under section 155, or of cross-examining any

witnesses on the depositions already taken, or of tendering

new witnesses on his own account.

Even though the Magistrate may not think it necessary

formally to explain to the accused any fresh offence which

may incidentally be disclosed in the course of the inquiry,

and in respect of which it is possible that a specific charge

may ultimately be preferred, yet it is open to him, and in

appropriate cases he ought, if the facts constituting the

alleged offence were not before the accused when he made his

statement under section 155, to interrogate him under

section 295 with reference to these facts, and thus afford him

13

an opportunity of giving any explanation with regard to

them. This interrogation of the accused under section 295 is

obligatory upon the Magistrate (see section 155 (3n and

should be administered, not with the object of investigating

the {acts, but in the interests of the accused. It is not an

ordeal through which the accused must pass, but a privilege

to which he is entiUed. One of the things which the

Magistrate may well bear in mind in the course of this

interrogation is the fact that allegations have been made

against the accused in the course of the inquiry which may

conceivably be made the subject of a count in the indictment.

He. may well say to the accused: II Do you wish to make any

statement as to this or that point? II (emphasis added)

In the judgment of Regina v Perera et al (Supra), the Court of

Criminal Appeal considered the relevancy and admissibility of the

evidence of the 2 nd Appellant before that Court, who apparently made a

confession and later in the inquiry denied his complicity to the offence to

which he is accused of.

Basnayake A.C.J. (as he was then) has considered this question and

concludes thus;

" It was contended by Counsel for the second appellant that

the disallowance of this application was wrong and that even

if the deposition. was not admissible under section 233 of the

14

Code it was admissible in order to prove the fact that the

statement P38, which the prosecution had already put in as a

confession of the second appellant, had been retracted by him

in his evidence at the non-summary inquiry. When asked to

state under which section he sought to have the statement

admitted he referred us to section 9 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Evidence gzven by a witness in a prevlOus judiCial

proceeding, even though it be that of an accused person,

cannot be admitted in evidence-in a subsequent proceeding

except in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance or the Criminal Procedure Code. Learned Counsel

for the second appellant did not seek to come under any

provision of the Criminal Procedure Code. A previous

deposition may be proved if relevant under sections 32, 33,

155 (c) and 157 of the Evidence Ordinance. It was not

argued before us, however, that any of these provisions-

permitted the use of the second appellant I s evidence in the

manner in which it was sought to be put in at the trial.

While the evidence in question would be an admission as

defined in section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance, it does

not appear to be one which could have been proved on behalf

of the second appellant under either of the paragraphs (a) or

(b) of section 21 of that Ordinance. With regard to paragraph

(c) of section 21, as stated above, section 9 was the only

provision of the Evidence Ordinance under which Counsel

15

urged that the evidence was relevant, othenvise than as an

admission. That section declares as relevant, inter alia, facts

II which rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or

relevant fact ". In so far as the evidence of the se.eond

appellant at the inquiry may have been relevant under this

section to rebut any inference that the Jury may have drawn

against him from the alleged confession of his which had been

put in evidence by the prosecution, its relevancy could have

arisen only on the basis that the facts deposed to in t'hat

evidence were true, and not otherwise. 1/

The above judgments, quoted at length, could be cited as instances

where the Superior Courts have expressed its views on the applicable

considerations to the evidence of an accused given at the preliminary

inquiry, emphasising its utility value in relation to the accused whilst

laying emphasis on safeguards that should be complied with in the

interests of the accused.

Our view that these provISIOns which facilitated an accused to

present his version of events to the offence he was charged with by

offering evidence either by himself or calling witnesses on his behalf is

further strengthened since the Legislature itself recognised the purpose of

recording the evidence of the accused and provided for the manner in

which the evidence of the accused should be considered by a High Court

with new legislative provisions.

16

Section 126 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was amended by

Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 14 of 2005 by which

the amended Section 126A(1)(b) provided for an accused to state that he

wishes to adduce evidence in support of the defence of an alibi.

Simultaneously another important amendment was also made to Section

154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act by adding subsection (2) which

read as "upon committal of the accused for the trial before the High Court, the

accused may state that he is willing to plead guilty to a lesser offence ... ".

If he indicates his willingness to plead guilty to a lesser offence, the

accused is placed at the ,advantage of having the High Court Judge duty

bound to consider his progressive approach as the amended Section 154 (2)

reads " ... shall, in sentencing the accused, have regard" to that fact.

Professor G.L. Peiris, in Appendix 1 of his book Criminal Procedure

in Sri Lanka under the Administration of Justice Law included an article

titled Abolition of Non Summary Proceedings. In the said article he identifies

the benefits that are accrued to an accused by holding such an inquiry. He

noted that it acts as a "judicial sieve" preventing" speculative prosecution"

and also provided prior notice of the case against the accused so that he

would not be surprised at his trial. It is interesting to note that the

importance of recording the evidence of the accused or his witnesses did

not feature in the said article in any way for the obvious reason that it is

not the primary intention of holding of a non-summary inquiry.

The version of the accused becomes vital if he is accused of a murder

since the law expected him to establish that he is entitled to the benefit of

lesser culpability on the proof of any of the general exceptions. Similarly, if

17

he wishes to plead to a lesser offence or takes up a defence of alibi, such

course of action will have some tangible benefit if he declares his

intentions at the inquiry. If he takes up the position of a total denial of the

allegation at the inquiry before the Magistrate, it has no bearing

whatsoever in the High Court since, irrespective of the fact that whether he

said it to the Police or to the inquiring Magistrate, that would not support,

enhance or diminish the value of his claim of denial. He could place his

claim of denial to the High Court, without any prejudice attached to it

since he is protected by the presumption of innocence as a Constitutional

right.

Sections ISO, 151 and 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

contained the word "shall", a term generally understood as meaning

mandatory. Bindra in Interpretation of Statutes ( 9th Ed) observed (at

p.953) that" A statutory requirement relating to a matter of practice or procedure

in the Court should be interpreted as mandatory if it confers upon a litigant a

substantial right, the violation of which will injure him or prejudice his case. On

the other hand, a statutory provision regulating a matter of practice or procedure

will generally be read as directory when the disregard of it or the failure to follow

it exactly will not materially prejudice a litigant's case or deprive him of a

substantial right."

It is in this backdrop that we must consider whether the

noncompliance of these mandatory provisions occasioned any failure of

justice.

The Proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution states that;

18

" ... no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or

irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occ3sioned a failure of justice."

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:-

"Subject to the provIsIOns hereinbefore contained any

judgment passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall

not be reversed or altered on appeal or revision on account -

(a) Of any error, omission, or irregularity in the

complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgement,

summing up, or other proceedings before or

during trial or in any inquiry of other proceedings

under this Code; or

(b) Of the want of any sanction required by section

135, unless such error, omission, irregularity, or

want has occasioned a failure of justice."

The effect of the applicability of these two statutory provisions is

that any error, defect or irregularity of the procedure adopted by a Court

exercising criminal jurisdiction or of the proceedings before it or the

19

judgment of that Court; to be reversed, altered or varied by an appellate

Court as a strictly enforced rule.

The judicial precedents that will be referred to in the following

segment of this judgment indicate that only the errors, 'defects or

irregularities that results in a "failure of justice" or has "prejudiced the

substantial rights of parties" qualify to be reversed, altered or varied by an

appellate Court. In view of this qualification, the errors, defects or

irregularities could be grouped into two categories.

One such category would be the procedural irregularities that are

committed by the trial C'ourts while the irregularities in relation to other

laws forms the other. Even among the procedural irregularities the Courts

have treated some as "fatal" to the conviction while some other procedural

irregularities were treated as the ones which could be "cured".

In relation to the "fatal" irregularities, it is seen from the judicial

precedents that when the complained irregularity of procedure affected

the jurisdiction of the trial Court, the appellate Courts showed no

hesitation in nullifying the proceedings.

The judgment of this Court in Sarathchandra v Attorney General

(2008) 2 Sri L.R. 35 is one such example. The trial Court has failed to

comply with the provisions of Sections 196, 197 and 198 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, by not reading out the charge in

the indictment to the accused and not recording his plea. It was held that

" ... the use of the word shall in Section 196 of the Code, to my mind, is not merely

directory but mandatory, and confers jurisdiction to try the accused only after

compliance of this mandatory provision. /I

20

In Abdulsameem v The Bribery Commissioner (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 76,

this Court refused to act under Section 436 when there was a failure to

frame a charge before the Magistrate's Court as it has been held that " ...

the omission to frame a charge is a breach of a fundamental principle< of criminal

procedure and that such failure is fatal to a conviction."

Similarly, in the judgment of Attorney General v Segulebbe Lateef

and Another (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 225, the Supreme Court determined that " ...

section 195 (ee) imposing a duty on the trial judge to inquire from the accused at

the time of serving the indictment whether or not the accused elects to be tried by a

jury. This is in recognition 9f the basic right of an accused to be tried by his peers.

It is left to the discretion of the accused to decide as to who should try him" and

refused to act under the proviso to Article 138.

The judgment of Karunadasa v The Attorney General (1985) 2 Sri

L.R. 22, the complaint was that a plea of guilty to a lesser offence was

recorded by the trial Court, without putting the issue whether to accept a

plea to the jury. This Court, having noted that " ... it is fundamental that a

trial must be held according to law and that in a trial by jury where an accused

has been given into the charge of the jury the verdict must be that of the jury"

rejected the Hon. Attorney General's application to act under Section 436.

However, there seems to be divergent views that had been

expressed in relation to other procedural irregularities over the

applicability of the provisions contained in Section 436 of the C

and Section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

In Mohideen v Inspector of Police 59 NLR 2117 Basnayake CJ was of

the strict view that;

21

"In my opinion section 425 was not designed to apply to a

complete disregard of the imperative requirements of the

Code. It seems to me to have been designed to apply to errors,

omissions or irregularities other than disregard of. the

imperative provisions of the Code. Failure to observe

provisions which are intended for the benefit of the citizen

and are in the interests of justice, especially in criminal

statutes, must be presumed to occasion a failure of justice. It

is not necessary for the party seeking relief to establish that

the failure to observe an imperative requirement of the Code

has occasioned a failure of justice. As in the case of a trial to

which the Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance applies, a

wrong decision of law is a sufficient ground for setting aside

a conviction unless the prosecution is in a position to

establish that no substantial miscarriage of justice has

actually occurred."

A more accommodative view is strongly expressed by Sansoni J in

Caldera v Wijewardene, Inspector of Police 65 N.L.R. 210,

"But I shall assume that there was an omission, as I wish to base my

decision on another ground as well, and that is on section 425 of the

Code. That provision cannot be overlooked, and it has in fact been

applied in cases very similar to the present one by Howard, c.]. in

Assen v. Maradana Police [(1944) 45 N. L. R. 263.J following earlier

cases, and by Wijeyewardene, ]. in Thomas v. Inspector of Police,

Kottawa [(1945) 47 N. L. R. 42.J. A contrary view appears to have

been taken by Soertsz, ]. In Vargheese v. Perera [(1942) 43 N. L. R.

22

564.J. In deciding which view I should follow I take into account that

section 425 provides that II no judgment passed by a court of

competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on appeal or

revision on account (a), of any error, omission or irregularity in the

complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other

proceedings before or during trial . ... unless such error, omission,

irregularity . . .. has occasioned a failure of justice. II There was a

time when it was thought that the positive requirements of the Code

were all essential, and that any breach of such a requirement

constituted an illegality. The supporters of this view generally rely . on the case of Subramania Iyer v. King Emperor[(1902) 25 N. L. R.

61.], decided by the Privy Council. But if this is the only possible

view, section 425 will be of little use, for it is in just those cases

where an express provision of the Code has been violated that the

section 425 can serve any purpose.

The Privy Council itself has held in later cases that not all infringe-

ments of the Code render the proceedings illegal or void. Thus, in

Abdul Raman v. Emperor[A. 1. R. (1927) P. C. 44.J it was held that

a violation of the section corresponding to our section 299 which

requires the deposition of each witness to be read over to him in the

presence of the accused or his pleader was not fatal. In Pulukuri

Kotayya v. Emperor[A. I. R. (1947) P. C. 67.J the Privy Council

deprecated the taking of too narrow a view of the operation of section

537 of the Indian Code which corresponds to our section 425. Sir

John Beaumont there said : II When a trial is conducted in a manner

different from that prescribed by the Code (as in Subramania Aiyar,

23

case) the trial is bad and no question of curing an irregularity arises

; but if the trial is conducted substantially in the manner prescribed

by the Code but some irregularity occurs in the course of such

conduct, the irregularity can be cured under section 53,7 and none

the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always

be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive

provisions of the Code. The distinction drawn in many of the cases

in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree

rather than of kind. II

. There is also a recent decision of the Supreme Court of India in

which the operation of section 537 was considered, see Slaney v.

State of Madhya Pradesk [A. I. R. (1956) S. C. 116.}. Bose, J.

expressed the view that the trend of the more recent decisions of the

Privy Council, and indeed all later-day criminal jurispnldence in

England as well as in India, has been away from technicality, to

regard the substance rather than the shadow, and to see whether

even where there has been a non-compliance with the provisions of

the Code there has actually been a failure of justice. Chandrasekhera

Aiyar, J. pointed out in that case that the gravity of the defect will

have to be considered-whether it is a mere unimportant mistake in

procedure or whether it is substantial and vital. He said: II If it is so

grave that prejudice will necessarily be implied or imported, it may

be described as an illegality. If the seriousness of the omission is of a

lesser degree it will be an irregularity, and prejudice by way of

failure of justice will have to be established. II As instances of

illegality he mentioned" lack of competency of jurisdiction, absence

24

..

of a complaint by the proper person or authority specified, want of

sanction prescribed as a condition precedent for a prosecution, in

short, defects that strike at the very root of jurisdiction. II

Having referred to the judgment of Mohideen v Inspector of Police,

of Basnayake A.C.J., Sans ani J has stated;

"I might also refer to the case of Mohideen v. Inspector of Police,

Petta [(1957) 59 N. L. R. 217.1, where Basnayake, c.]. and K. D. de

, Silva, ]. (Pulle, J. dissenting) decided that where an accused is

brought before the court in custody without process, evidence should

be recorded before a charge is framed. In the later case of de Silva v.

Sub-Inspector of Police, Matara [ (1960) 62 N. L. R. 92.r

Basnayake, c.]. has held that where proceedings are instituted under

section 148 (1) (b) of the Code, the evidence of the person who

brought the accused before the court need not be recorded. The

learned Chief Justice would appear to have confined the application

of section 151 (2), so far as it requires the evidence of the person who

brought the accuse d before the court to be recorded, to cases where

no report is filed under section 148 (1) (b). If that be the correct

view, then there was no irregularity in the case I am now deciding.

This distinction has clearly been spelt out in an English case dedded

in 2002. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales, in its judgment of R v

Hanrattlj [2002] Cr. App. R 30, quoted the following statement of the Lord

Chief Jus tice Cars well;

25

"It seems to us that it is now possible to formulate two

propositions in respect of irregularities at trial ...

1. If there was a material irregularity the conviction

may be set aside even if the evidence of the

appellant's guilt is clear,

2. Not every irregularity will cause a conviction to

be set aside. There is room for the application of a

test similar in effect to that of the former

provision, viz. whether the irregularity was so

serious that a miscarriage of justice has actually

occurred. "

The Privy Council, in its decision of Randall v R [2002] UK PC 19,

provided clear guidance and direction to distinguish between procedural

flaws which are technical and those which are not on following terms;

"While reference has been made above to some of the rules

which should be observed in a well conducted trial to

safeguard the fairness of the proceedings, its not every

departure from good practice which renders a trial unfair.

Inevitably, in the course of a long trial, things a done or said

which should not be done or said. Most occurrences of that

kind do not undermine the integrity of the trial, particularly

if they are isolated and particularly if, where appropriate,

26

they are the subject of clear judicial direction. It would

emasculate the trial process and undermine public confidence

in the administration of criminal justice, if a standard of

perfection were imposed that was incapable of attainme11t in

practice. But the right of a criminal defendant to a fair trial

is absolute. There will come a point when departure from

good practice is so gross, or so persistent, or so prejudicial, or

so irremediable that an appellate Court will have no choice

but to condemn a trial as unfair and quash a conviction as

unsafe, however strong the grounds for believing the

, defendant to be guilty. The right to a fair trial is one to be

enjoyed by the guilty as well as the innocent, for a defendant

is presumed to be innocent until proved to be otherwise in a

fairly conducted trial."

Interestingly a similar view was expressed in 1911. Manuel v

Kanapanickan 14 N.L.R. 186, where the complaint before Wood Renton J

was that the Magistrate's Court had admitted part of an unsworn evidence

by the complainant, which the complainant had interjected during

examination of another witness. This interjection had formed the part of

the proceedings which later utilised by the trial Court to convict the

accused.

Having observed that "Mistakes are made there. Sometimes one feels in

hearing appeals that mistakes have been made which ought to have been avoided"

his Lordship thereafter proceeded to dismiss the appeal after the following

observation:-

27

"

II If the Supreme Court were not merely to be (as it ought to

be) careful to mark what seems amiss in the criminal

proceedings that come before it in appeal, but to punish the

Magistrate and, be it added, the Colony for formal errors, in

cases where substantial justice has been done, the practice

would be productive of results which I am afraid that those

who address to us arguments of the sort that I am

considering imperfectly realize. It would make an

administration of criminal justice a mere lottery, an offer to

people who delight already to gamble with litigation an

irresistible temptation to gamble also with crime. Here, as in

India, the Legislature has foreseen these points, and has

expressly provided that irregularities in criminal proceedings

shall be no ground for the reversal or alteration of sentences

on appeal, unless there has been a 'failure of justice", and

that no new trial or reversal of any decision shall be allowed

in any case on the ground of the improper admission of

evidence if it appears that independently of the so admitted

there are sufficient materials to justify the conclusion at

which the trial judge arrived. In Ceylon the rule above stated

as to irregularities which existed under the old Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1883, has been reproduced in the

present Code. The rule as to the improper admission of

evidence is embodies in the Evidence Ordinance. We have no

power, even if we had the will, to ignore either the letter or

the spirit of these statutory provisions. There are, of course,

irregularities the mere presence of which imports prejudice,

28

such as the trial of a man for a number of different offences at

the same time, or the failure of the Courts to give accused

person a chance of defending themselves before exercising

summery powers of punishment for contempt. /I

It appears that the Legislature, in its wisdom thought it fit to give

recognition of this line of thinking by enacting section 456A with the

amendment it brought to Code of Criminal Procedure Act within a year

from its enactment by Act No. 52 of 1980.

As correctly relied upon by the learned Senior State Counsel, the

newly added Section 456A of the said Act reads thus;

"The failure to comply with any provision of this Code shall not

affect or be deemed to have affected the validity of any complaint,

committal or indictment or of the admissibility of any evidence

unless such failure has occasioned a substantial miscarriage of

justice./1

There was no claim of consent raised by any of the Appellants nor

did they take up the defence of alibi. The Appellant's collective response to

the allegation of rape is a total denial. They claim they were not involved

with this incident whatsoever. Now the question is whether the failure to

present their claim of total denial before the Magistrate under Section

154(2) prevented them of taking said defence before the High Court and

thereby depriving them of a fair trial. In our view there was no legal or

other impediment for the Appellant's in claiming a total denial before the

29

High Court, upon the fact that there is no record available which is

indicative of their stance before the Magistrate's Court.

In assessing credibility of the Appellant's evidence in taking up the

position of total denial, the High Court could not have assessed it

differently even if they failed to take up at the non-summary inquiry. On

the other hand, even if they stated that they did commit rape in their

statutory statement, the Appellants are entitled to plead not guilty before

the High Court and contest the prosecution case on its merits. They could

retract the contents of th'eir statutory statement without any prejudice to

their rights. There is no lesser culpability involved in a charge of rape,

unless the facts reveal commission of some other offence and not rape.

In the judgment of Attorney General v Segulebbe La tee! and Another

(supra) the Supreme Court listed out several considerations in ensuring

the right of an accused to a fair trial. One such consideration relevant to

the present situation is " ... the right of an accused to examine or have examined

the witnesses against him and to obtain the evidence examination of witnesses on

his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him".

We see no violation of this principle in the appeal before us, with the

failure of the inquiring Magistrate to comply with Section 150 to 152 of the

Act No. 15 of 1979. The Appellants offered evidence before the High Court

individually and through their witnesses.

30

Since the days of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1883 to the current

Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No.2 of 2013, the

provisions concerning the evidence of an accused have not changed in any

significant manner. However, we note from the judgments reported

during the early part of the nineteenth century to modern times, the

attitude of the accused and the legal practitioners who represented them

towards utilising the statutory opportunity to present their case before the

inquiring Magistrate has undergone radical changes. In the early days,

there was the tendency to place evidence before the Magistrate that would

tend to reduce the culpa~ility of the accused. Implementation of the death

penalty may have contributed to this attitude. Of late, the practice of

leading evidence of the accused and his witnesses during the preliminary

inquiry has significantly dwindled into almost a redundant state.

This could well be the reason, the Legislature, in passing legislation

in the form of the Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 15 of

2005 and its successive enactments, through Section 15, provided a

window of opportunity for adaptability to accommodate current practices

when it stated "The provisions of Chapter XV of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 shall mutatis mutandis apply to any

preliminary inquiry held under the provisions of this Act."

As it has already been decided in Regina v Arthur Perera (supra)

that the prosecution is not bound to put in and read such evidence by the

accused, the failure to record his statutory statement could not in any way

affect his entitlement to a fair trial nor to prejudice his rights.

31

J

~ In view of these considerations, we are of the firm view that the

failure of the prosecution to put the statutory statement before the close of

the prosecution case at the High Court of Jaffna and the failure to record

their statutory statement when the Magistrate decided not to" act under

Section 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act has not violated

substantial rights of the Appellant nor has it resulted in a failure of justice.

Therefore, we answer the issue; whether the substantial rights of the

Appellants were prejudiced or whether there was a failure of justice

resulted in due to the noncompliance of the mandatory provisions

contained in Sections150,.151 and 152 and 199(3) by the prosecution, in the

negative.

The conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellants is affirmed

by this Court and their appeal is accordingly dismissed.
