Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners who are senior practitioners of the Homeopathic

Council of Sri Lanka filed this application mainly against the 1st

respondent (Minister of Indigenous Medicine), the 2nd

respondent (Secretary thereof), the 4th respondent (Secretary,

Homeopathic Council), the 5th respondent (Advisor to Minister of

Indigenous Medicine), and the 10th respondent (Homeopathy

Interim Control Committee) seeking to quash by writ of certiorari

the decision to call for applications for registration of new

homeopathy practitioners as reflected in P8, and to prevent by

writ of prohibition from registering new homoeopathy

practitioners usurping powers of the Homoeopathic Council.

Homeopathic Council of Sri Lanka is a statutory body created by

Homeopathy Act, No.7 of 1970. The members to the council are

elected, according to the Act, by the homeopathic practitioners

registered under the said Act. The Minister has, on or about

20.10.2009, removed the elected members to the Council and

appointed new members on his own choice in contravention of

the Act. The Supreme Court in the Fundamental Right

Application filed by the removed members (SC/FR/891/2009 SC

Minutes dated 31.03.2016) held that the said decision of the

Minister is null and void. Pending the said Fundamental Right

Application, the Minister has appointed an Interim Committee to

do the work of the Council when there is no provision in the Act

empowering the Minister to do so. It is the position of the

Minister that the said Interim Committee was appointed with the

concurrence of the Cabinet of Ministers and tenders R14A in

support. By looking at R14A Cabinet Decision, it is clear that

the Cabinet has not consented for such an Interim Committee

3

being appointed. It says, after discussion, it was decided that

action should be taken by the Ministry on this matter in

consultation with the Hon. Attorney General. There is no proof

such an advice was given by the Attorney General. According to

P8, it is this Interim Committee which has called for the

registration of new homoeopathy practitioners.

Appointment of the Interim Committee by the Minister is ultra

vires. Then the decisions made by the purported Interim

Committee are null and void ab initio.

Once the Supreme Court in the aforesaid fundamental right

application decided that the removal of the legally elected

members of the Council and appointment of the new members

to the Council are null and void, everything which flow from

those bad decisions also become null and void. One such was

the appointment of an Interim Committee.

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL ER

1169 at 1172 stated thus:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only

bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the

court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void.

Without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to

have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You

cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

This passage was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva J.

(later C.J.) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha

LR 164 at 168-169.

This principle was applied by the Supreme Court in the recent

case of Padmal Ariyasiri Mendis v. Vijith Abraham de Silva [2016]

BLR 69 at 73 where it was held that:

The deed No. 1551 is void ab initio and therefore the title

does not pass from the plaintiff to any other person.

Therefore deed which was executed thereafter, i.e. deed No.

976 is also void ab initio.

Learned Senior DSG for the respondents in his written

submissions seeks to dismiss the petitioners application on

futility on the basis that five new homeopathy practitioners were

registered in response to the advertisement P8 pending

determination of this application. That registration of five new

members is on the above-mentioned principle of law is a nullity.

I must also add that it is well settled law that rights of the

parties shall be determined at the time of the institution of the

action. (Abayadeera v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor,

University of Colombo [1983] 2 Sri LR 267 at 280, Kalamazoo
