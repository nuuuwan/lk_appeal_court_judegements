Samayawardhena, J.

The nine petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by

way of writ of certiorari the decision made by the 1st respondent

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to promote the 9th-19th

respondents to the posts of Accounting Assistants; and to

compel the CEB by way of writ of mandamus to call the

petitioners for an interview and to appoint them as Accounting

Assistants.

The petitioners and the respondents (except the 1st-8th, i.e. the

CEB and the Board Members) are employees of the CEB.

By P10 dated 12.01.2015, the CEB invited the employees to

apply for the examination to fill 14 vacancies of Accounting

Assistants. The selection procedure is stated in circulars

marked P14-P16, and it is common ground that the final

selection is dependent upon the vacancies exist at the time of

the interview and not at the time of the advertisement.

It is the contention of the petitioners that at the time of the

interview held on 26.11.2015 for the year 2015, there were 24

vacancies.

Various things such as calling for fresh applications stating that

only 8 vacancies are available1, promotions of some employees

who have passed the examinations held in previous years2 in

compliance with the directions of the Public Petitions Committee

1 Vide 3AR2.

2 Vide Board decision 3AR1.

3

of Parliament 3 etc. have happened in between the P10

advertisement and the interview held, but there is no necessity

to make a detailed analysis of those things as what is important

is the vacancies existed at the time of the interview.

The petitioners do not dispute that 14 employees were promoted

as Accounting Assistants in 2015 in order of the Merit List

marked 3AR4.

Their complaint is that the balance 10 vacancies which should

have been filled from 2015 Merit List were filled from employees

applied for the said post in previous years to the detriment of the

petitioners, which, according to the petitioners, is against the

governing circulars referred to above.

The CEB admits that there were 10 more vacancies, but says

that they were created after the aforesaid interview in 2015.

The petitioners vehemently deny this and tenders the Board

Paper marked P12 dated 29.04.2016 to counter that position. In

P12 it is stated inter alia that, according to the Financial

Managers letter, there were 10 vacancies for Accounting

Assistants at the time of the interview.

The learned DSG for the CEB does not accept P12 as a valid

document. Firstly learned DSG says that it is a confidential

document; and secondly it is only a Board Paper and not a

Board decision; and thirdly it reflects the position as at

29.04.2016 and not at the time of the interview held on

3 Vide P13.

4

26.11.2015 and tenders marked 3AR7(a) the Financial

Managers letter (dated 26.02.2016) referred to in P12.

Not to be outdone, learned counsel for the petitioners points to

the letter marked 3AR3 dated 27.11.2015 of the same Finance

Manager (prepared soon after the interview) for the purpose of

comparison with 3AR7(a) to say that the said contention of the

learned DSG is false and those vacancies were in existences at

the time of the interview.

Although contents of 3AR3 and 3AR7(a) are not identical, there

is great force in the argument of the learned counsel for the

petitioners.

However, there is no agreement between the parties as to the

exact number of vacancies existed at the date of the interview for

2015. Nor is there any document(s) by which Court can without

any difficulty come to a firm finding on the exact number of

vacancies existed at the date of the interview. Different

documents give different figures and open for various

interpretations.

If facts are in dispute, this Court in the exercise of writ

jurisdiction has no authority hold an inquiry into it in order to

ascertain the correct factual position (as to the number of

vacancies) in order to grant or refuse relief to the petitioners. It

is trite law that when major facts are in dispute, writ does not lie.

(Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 2 Sri LR 471, Dr.

Puvanendran v. Premasiri [2009] 2 Sri LR 107, Wijenayake v.

Minister of Public Administration [2011] 2 Sri LR 247) Hence the

petitioners cannot succeed in this application.

Let me add the following in passing. It is not the complaint of

the petitioners that complete outsiders who did not possess the

qualifications were promoted as Accounting Assistants. The

respondents whom the petitioners say were wrongly promoted

were in the same position as that of the petitioners. The only

point raised was that they did not sit for 2015 examination.

However, the petitioners admit (or do not dispute) that they sat

for previous examinations and qualified to be promoted to the

said post, but due to no fault of them, and due to the lapses on

the part of the CEB administration, their promotions were not

given at the right timevide the direction of the Public Petitions

Committee of Parliament marked P13. This is further

understood by the additional petition filed by the petitioners

dated 15.03.2017 whereby the petitioners sought an interim

order preventing the CEB from holding the 2017 examination to

fill the then existing vacancies stating that such a course of

action will cause injustice to them (when promotions are given

on 2017 examination). That is similar to the grievances of the

employees whose promotions are being challenged in these

proceedings. This is a never-ending process unless the CEB

stops this unhealthy practice (which seems to be adopting with

ulterior motives). This causes inter alia disunity among the

employees (which may sometimes be one of such ulterior

motives).

If the certiorari cannot be issued, consideration of the

application for mandamus does not arise.

Application is dismissed without costs.
