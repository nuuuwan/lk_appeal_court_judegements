ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an application by the Petitioner seeking issuance of a

mandate in the nature of writ of Habeas Corpus against the 1st Respondent

to bring the 2nd Respondent, a girl child of seven years of age, before this

Court. The Petitioner states that she is the daughter of the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner also prayed for an order from this Court which would

permit him to make an application in the District Court of Bandarawela to

inquire into the dispute with regard to the illegal detention of the 2nd

Respondent by the 1st Respondent and to make order granting access to

him to see the 2nd Respondent.

It is stated by the Petitioner that he met the 1st Respondent, who

already had a male child elder to the 2nd Respondent, in Colombo during

2008 when his services, as a three wheeler driver, was obtained by her. The

2

1 st Respondent's marriage to her husband was already" estranged". At that

time, her husband was employed in a foreign country and the Petitioner's

regular interaction with the 1st Respondent transformed their relationship

in to an "affair" and ". .. as a result of the said affair the 2nd Respondent

above named was born on 25th April 2010." He believed that he is the

"natural father" of the 2nd Respondent. After the 2nd Respondent's birth,

the Petitioner claimed that he had looked after the welfare of the 1st

Respondent and her two children. The Petitioner had then left Sri Lanka

for foreign employment in 2015 and left his A TM card with the 1st

Respondent to facilitate him to remit some of his earnings for their

maintenance. Whilst engaged in his employment overseas, the Petitioner

had maintained his relationship with the 1st Respondent as he was "very

attached to his daughter", the 2nd Respondent.

Upon his return to Sri Lanka in March 2016, the Petitioner was told

by the 1st Respondent that she did not wish to continue their" affair". She

returned his ATM card and already had shifted her residence out of

Colombo and thereby deprived the Petitioner of any access to the 2nd

Respondent.

The 1st Respondent filed her objections resisting the application of

the Petitioner and moved Court to dismiss it in limine. She denied the claim

of paternity of the Petitioner and stated that her husband was in Sri Lanka

during the period May to July 2009 and she became pregnant with the 2nd

Respondent during this time. The 2nd Respondent was born on 25th April

2010 at a private hospital in Colombo and it was her husband who funded

her hospital bill of Rs. 150,150.00. The 1st Respondent with her two

3

children visited her husband in Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where he

was employed in 2012.

The 1st Respondent's description of the relationship between her and

the Petitioner is limited only to obtain his services frequently for the

transportation needs of her family. In addition, the Petitioner was helpful

in her interaction with the members of Madera neighbourhood since her

familiarity in the Sinhala language was limited due to her up country

Tamil origin.

In explaining the reason for the Petitioner's act of leaving his A TM

card in her possession, the 1st Respondent stated that he was in need of

funding for his air ticket upon his request, she had pawned some items of

jewellery to give around Rs. 45,000.00 to him with the promise of

repayment with his salary, which undertaking he fulfilled during the

subsequent period. In addition, a sum of Rs. 60,000.00 was also paid to

another person from whom the Petitioner had obtained some financial

assistance. Once the Petitioner returned to the island, the ATM card was

duly returned to him.

As a preliminary objection to the application of the Petitioner, the 1st

Respondent states that there exists an equally effective alternative remedy

to the Petitioner by way of Section 24(3) of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978

as amended.

The Petitioner, in his counter affidavit, denied the position taken up

by the 1st Respondent and tendered copies of the remittances he made to

the account on which the A TM card was issued.

4

It is in this factual backdrop that this Court must venture to consider

the application of the Petitioner.

The application of the Petitioner is based on the premise that he is

the natural father of the 2nd Respondent. He does not dispute the fact that

the marriage of the mother of the 2nd Respondent to her husband remained

legally valid even at the time of his application to this Court. The marriage

certificate of the 1st Respondent is tendered as 'X3' while the birth

certificates of both her children are marked as 'X4' and 'X7' respectively.

Clearly the Petitioner is a stranger to the contract of marriage that exists

between the 1st Respondent and her husband. With his claim of paternity,

the Petitioner seeks to challenge the legitimacy of the 2nd Respondent and

the presumption under Section 112 of the Evidence Ordinance in her

favour.

A similar situation arose for consideration of Court in Ubeyratne v

Karunawathie and Others (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 16 except for the motive of

institution of action. This was a matter where the Defendant-Appellant, a

third party, claimed that one Gunaratne was separated from his legal wife

(the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent) and her three children (2nd to 4th Plaintiff-

Respondents) who were born subsequent to the said separation are

therefore illegitimate. It is contested by the Defendant-Appellant that as

such they are not entitled to any rights over the estate of said Gunaratne.

In this judgment, their Lordships have identified the dispute before

Court as an instance where " ... a third party is attempting to deny paternity of

the children and question the legitimacy of children born during the continuance

of a valid marriage" as the Petitioner before us did in the instant matter.

5

In consideration of this issue, Jayawickrama J states in the said

judgment;

" ... the question of legitimacy and paternity should be

decided between the parties who are directly affected by

such a question. A third party may only lead evidence

of such facts elicited in a contest between the parties in

a Court of law regarding such matter. A third party

who is not a party to a contract of marriage when he

files an action in a Court of law to canvass the validity

of a marriage or the legitimacy or paternity of the

children born during that valid marriage is trying to

import his opinion on what had taken place. The

question of validity of a marriage, paternity and

legitimacy of the children are personal matters to be

decided by a Court of competent jurisdiction amidst

the parties affected by the marital contract. A third

party should not have any legal right to attack the

validity of such a contract of marriage nor its

consequences. Of course, a third party may make use

of the facts proving the relationship that existed

between the contracting parties, provided they are

relevant to the matters in issue."

His Lordship further stated;

"... in law, the marrzage between the Plaintiff

Respondent and her husband continued to be a valid

marriage until her husband's death. Therefore, the

6

children born during the continuance of that valid

marriage are presumed legitimate children. In deciding

such facts, a Court will always consider what is best in

the interest and welfare of the children. In such a

situation the mere denial of paternity by the husband

will not make the children illegitimate. In the instant

case there is no proof of the dissolution of the marriage

between the Plaintiff Respondent and her husband.

Hence, the presumption under Section 112 of the

Evidence Ordinance is applicable to the children born

to such marriage .. . as the 2nd to 4th Plaintiff

Respondents were born during the continuation of a

valid marriage between the parents mentioned in their

respective birth certificates that fact is to be deemed as

conclusive proof that they are the legitimate children of

their putative father. This is a statutory recognition of

the principle underlying the maxim 'Pater is est quem

nuptiae demonstrant', which is recognised both Roman

Dutch and English law ... The question of no access

in Section 112 of the Evidence Ordinance should be

raised and canvassed only by a disputing father, not by

a third party. "

In applying the principles of law that had been enunciated in the

said judgment, the Petitioner cannot be allowed to challenge the paternity

of the 2nd Respondent who was born to the 1st Respondent during a legally

valid marriage. The 2nd Respondent is clearly entitled to the protection of

her presumed paternity as reflected in her birth certificate under Section 7

112 of the Evidence Ordinance. Even in relation to an illegitimate child, a

third party cannot generally override the natural rights of its mother.

The judgment of Premawathie v Kudalugoda Arachchi 75 N.L.R.

398, deals with this point. Weeramantry J, having stated that "... the

principles of the Roman Dutch law it is clear that the mother of an illegitimate

child is the natural guardian and entitled as such to the custody of the child as

against a stranger" also observed that "... the overriding importance of the

welfare of the child even in cases where the natural guardian'S claim is resisted by

a stranger".

As such, there is no acceptable legal basis on which the Petitioner

could rely on, in claiming the relief that he had prayed for. The judgment

of Atukorala v Atukorala and Others (1987) 1 Sri L.R. 388 that had been

relied upon by the Petitioner in support of his application is clearly

distinguishable from the fact that it concerns a dispute regarding the

custody of minor children between husband and wife and not with a third

party. The considerations that are applied in relation to conducting DNA

testing to determine paternity in Weerasinghe v Jayasinghe (2007) 2 Sri

L.R. 50 also cannot be applied to the matter before us since it is a matter

where paternity is disputed in an application for maintenance.

Proviso to Article 141 enables this Court, if it is satisfied that any

dispute regarding the custody of a minor child may more properly be

dealt by a Court, to which the jurisdiction in respect of the custody and

control of minor children is invested by provisions of law and then it could

direct the parties to make application to such Court.

8

The Petitioner has failed to satisfy us that there exists a legally

recognizable dispute regarding the custody of the 2nd Respondent, a

minor child.

Therefore, we are of the view that the application of the Petitioner

had been made without a proper legal basis. His application is

accordingly refused.

The petition of the petitioner is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 25, 000 /=.
