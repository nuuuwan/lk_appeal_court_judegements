The Petitioners filed this application in the Magistrates Court on

30.06.2008 against the Respondent under section 66(1)(b) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979, seeking

restoration of possession of the land in suit in terms of section

68(3) of the Act on the basis that they were forcibly dispossessed

from the land by the Respondent within two months prior to the

filing of the application. The Respondent in his counter affidavit

resisted the application of the Petitioners on the basis that the

dispossession took place outside the period of two months. After

inquiry, the learned Magistrate by order dated 10.02.2009 held

with the Petitioners. Being aggrieved by that order, the

Respondent went before the High Court and the High Court by

Judgment dated 23.03.2010 set aside the order of the

Magistrates Court. This appeal by the Petitioners is against the

Judgment of the High Court.

The High Court basically set aside the Magistrates Court order

on the basis that the disputed land is a paddy land and also a

state land, and therefore the Magistrates Court has no

jurisdiction to inquire into this dispute under section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act. The High Court has taken up

3

the position that the dispute shall be dealt with under the

provisions of the Agrarian Development Act, No. 46 of 2000. I

have no hesitation to state that the learned High Court Judge

has manifestly misdirected himself in law on jurisdiction.

It is erroneous to conclude that invocation of section 66 of the

Primary Courts' Procedure Act can only be done provided the

dispute relates to a private land as opposed to a state land. If

the dispute is a land dispute as defined in section 75 of the Act,

as a result of which there is an imminent threat to the breach of

the peace, irrespective of whether the land is a state land or a

private land, the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to make a

provisional order in accordance with law with the sole objective

of preventing the breach of the peace until the substantive rights

of the parties are decided by the District Court.

The finding of the learned High Court Judge that, as the dispute

relates to a paddy land, the dispute shall be resolved under the

mechanism provided in the Agrarian Development Act, No. 46 of

2000, as amended, and not under section 66 of the Primary

Courts' Procedure Act, is also bad in law.

Mansoor v. OIC Avissawella [1991] 2 Sri LR 75, which the

learned High Court Judge heavily relied on is based on the well-

established general principle that: "Where a statute creates a

right and, in plain language, gives a specific remedy or appoints a

specific tribunal for its enforcement, a party seeking to enforce the

right must resort to that tribunal and not to others."

The Agrarian Development Act is a special Act passed, as the

long title of the Act suggests, predominantly, to "provide for

4

matters relating to landlords and tenant cultivators of paddy

lands". Hence the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to entertain

and determine such disputes is ousted. Section 98 of the

Agrarian Development Act enacts:

The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding

anything to the contrary in any other written law, and

accordingly, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency

between the provisions of this Act and such other law, the

provisions of this Act shall prevail.

However, Agrarian Development Act does not oust the

jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Courts exercisable under section

66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, merely because the

dispute relates to a paddy land. For the former Act to be

applicable, and the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court is to be

ousted, there shall be a landlord and tenant cultivator

relationship between the two contending parties.

Further, one party in a section 66 application can claim to be a

tenant cultivator. It is a mistake to think that the moment such

a claim is made, the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is

instantly ousted. The jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is

ousted, if, and only if, the two contesting parties in the first

place accept a relationship of landlord and tenant cultivator

between them. If one party denies it, the Court has the

jurisdiction to determine the matter. (Hearth v. Peter [1989] 2 Sri

LR 325)

I might also add that merely because one party to the section 66

application is a tenant cultivator, the Court does not lack

5

jurisdiction, if the disputing party is not his landlord but an

outsider.

For completeness let me also state that in case the Court

decides that it has no jurisdiction due to the relationship of

landlord and tenant cultivator being accepted, still, the Court

has inherent jurisdiction to make a suitable order to maintain

status quo until the parities seek relief under the provisions of

the Agrarian Development Act.

Learned counsel for the Respondent in his short written

submission states that the Petitioners instituted the action after

two months of the alleged dispossession. This appears to be

correct. The Petitioners filed the case in the Magistrates Court

on 30.06.2008. According to the first complaint made to the

police by the first Petitioner on 28.04.2008 (found at page 78 of

the Brief), the Petitioners have been forcibly dispossessed from

the land by the Respondent on that day, i.e. 28.04.2008. In that

complaint the first Petitioner has stated that the Respondent

together with about 20 people was ploughing the paddy field

which she had been cultivating since 1992. This complaint has

completely escaped the attention of the learned Magistrate. As

seen from the complaint of the first Petitioner made to the police

on 07.05.2008 (found at page 60 of the Brief), the Respondent

has continued ploughing on 07.05.2008 as well. Thereafter, as

seen from the next complaint of the first Petitioner made to the

police on 21.05.2008 (found at page 70 of the Brief), the

Respondent has sowed paddy in the paddy land on 20.05.2008.

It is very unfortunate that the police did not report the matter to

the Magistrates Court under section 66 of the Primary Courts

6

Procedure Act soon after the first complaint was made or at any

time thereafter. The Petitioners have filed the action under

section 66(1)(b) as a private plaint two months after the said

dispossession. Hence no relief under section 68(3) can be

granted in favour of the Petitioners.

Although I do not agree with the reasoning of the High Court

Judge, I am compelled to agree with the conclusion.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
