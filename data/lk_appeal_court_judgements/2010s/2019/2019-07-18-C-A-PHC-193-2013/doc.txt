Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents-Petitioners-Appellants have filed this

appeal against the Judgment of the High Court dated 28.10.2013

whereby the order of the Magistrates Court dated 18.12.2012 was

affirmed.

The police instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court under

section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act making the

1st Respondent and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents parties upon a

road dispute. Several other parties later intervened supporting the

case of the 1st Respondent. It was the position of the 1st

Respondent that the disputed road, which has been using for a

long time was closed by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents recently. This

was established by a spate of documents, mostly affidavits

3

tendered by respectable people of the area. There had been two

police observation reports, and the first one is favourable to the 1st

Respondent and the second one to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

The learned Magistrate has, in the facts and circumstances of the

case, accepted the first one as the one which portrays the true

situation.

The main complaint of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents is that there is

an alternative road from the northern boundary of the 1st

Respondents land. However there is no evidence that the 1st

Respondent and the intervenient Respondents had been using that

road before the alleged obstruction of the disputed road.

The argument of the learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents that there was no threat to the breach of peace and

therefore the Magistrates Court had no jurisdiction cannot be

acceptable when the proceedings are initiated by the police as

opposed to an individual. When proceedings are instituted by the

police threat to the breach of the peace is presumed. Vide Punchi

Nona v. Padumasena [1994] 2 Sri LR 117.

What the learned Magistrate has ordered is a provisional one until

the rights of the parties are decided by the District Court. If the

2nd and 3rd Respondents think that there is an alternative road

although less convenient, they can file a civil case in the District

Court to vindicate their rights.

I see no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the High Court,

which affirmed the order of the Magistrates Court.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
