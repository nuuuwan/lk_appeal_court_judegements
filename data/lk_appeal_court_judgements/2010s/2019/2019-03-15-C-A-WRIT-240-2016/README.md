Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application basically seeking to

challenge the Army Board decision not to recommend the

petitioner for the confirmation in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel,

and rejection of the appeal made therefrom to the Commander of

the Army. He seeks to quash those decisions by way of

certiorari. He also seeks a writ of prohibition prohibiting the

Secretary to the Defence Ministry from recommending the

retirement of him from the Army effective from 18.08.2016, and

a writ of mandamus compelling the Commander of the Army and

the Secretary to the Defence Ministry to recommend to HE the

President to confirm him in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel

effective from 10.02.2010.

As seen from R12, HE the President, before this application was

filed, has approved the recommendation of the Commander of

the Army to retire the petitioner effective from 18.08.2016 as the

petitioner by that date has completed the maximum period of

service in his rank as a major, and to promote the petitioner to

the next rank of Lieutenant Colonel from the said date of

retirement. To that extent, this application is futile, and, at

least, writs of prohibition and mandamus are redundant.

However the learned counsel for the petitioner says that it does

not prevent this Court to consider issuance of certiorari

quashing the Army Board decision not to recommend the

petitioner for the confirmation in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel,

and subsequent rejection of the appeal made to the Commander

of the Army because if they are quashed, HE the President might

reconsider his decision.

Had the Army Board recommended the promotion, the petitioner

would not have reached the maximum permissible period of

service in the substantive rank of Major, and would not have

retired by 18.08.2016.

The objections of the respondents have been tendered with the

affidavit of the Commander of the Army supported by documents

R1-R12. There is no necessity to make a detailed analysis of the

said documents as they are self-explanatory. This Court cannot

by exercising writ jurisdiction sit as the final interview board for

the promotion and substitute the decision of this Court for that

of the Army Board. That is not the task of this Court.

However when I carefully go through the documents marked R1-

R8(b), I am fully convinced that the decision of the Army Board

not to recommend the petitioner to the next promotion in the

rank of Lieutenant Colonel is not unreasonable according to the

standard of unreasonableness as set out in Associated Provincial

Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223,

which is commonly known as Wednesbury unreasonableness.

It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of

logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person

who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could

have arrived at it. (Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for

the Civil Service [1984] 3 All ER 935) The impugned decisions

definitely do not fall into that category.

There are several adverse reports against the petitioner. It is

significant to note that they are not from one officer but from

different officers. If I may advert to a few, for the purpose of

record, by R1, the Commandant of the Military Academy,

Brigadier Perera, has complained to the Centre Commandant in

4

2009 against the petitioner for serious dereliction of duties. By

R2, in 2013, Colonel Gunasoma has made a detailed adverse

report against him and given a final warning and kept him

under observation for 60 days to show improvement. By R3, his

successor, Colonel Sirishantha, has reported that the petitioner

has not shown any improvement. Thereafter by R4 he has been

removed from command as the commanding officer of the 23rd

battalion of the Sinha Regiment Unit by the Colonel of the

Regiment, Major General Perera (not the same Perera who

issued R1). R5 shows his poor disciplinary record. R7 adverse

report is from Brigadier Dharmasiri. R8(b) from Lieutenant

Colonel Weeraratne. Another allegation is that the petitioner

was absent without leave from 07.02.2014-15.02.2014, which

the petitioner denies. Eight-day salary deduction has been

made for this, and the petitioner is finding fault with the

Director Legal on that matter.

The main allegation against the petitioner seems to be his lack of

commitment towards his official duties and giving priority to his

personal affairs over official work.

It is not the petitioners position that, even if that allegation is

correct, he should have been given the promotion. His position

is that the said allegation is not correct. Those are disputed

matters, which cannot be decided in a writ application. And

also those decisions are subjective. There is no violation of the

procedure and the decisions are not ultra vires. The petitioner

has been allowed to tell his grievances even to the Commander

of the Army.

This Court cannot decide promotions in the Army. It shall be

best left to the Commander of the Army. Court will interfere

5

with it if the decision is perverse, or, put differently, if there is

an error of law on the face of the record. I see no such error in

the facts and circumstances of this case.

Promotions cannot be based purely on seniority. Promotions

are not automatic. One must earn it. Merits shall be the

decisive factor. The Board has refused to recommend the

promotion and the Commander of the Army has confirmed it on

that basis.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed.
