Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs filed this action to partition the land between the

plaintiffs and 1st5th defendants. The 3rd and 5th defendants

claimed undivided rights in the manner they have pleaded in

their statement of claim.

The 5th defendant filed this appeal against the order of the

learned District Judge whereby partition action was dismissed

upon withdrawal by the plaintiffs, and the application of the 5th

defendant to proceed with the action was rejected.

At the argument no extensive oral submissions were made as

the counsel agreed to file written submissions. No written

submissions have been filed on behalf of the appellant.

In any event, this appeal is bad in law as no direct appeal lies

against the impugned order except with leave of this Court first

had and obtained. Vide the Seven Judge Bench decision of the

Supreme Court in Senanayake v. Jayantha (SC Appeal No.

41/2015) decided on 04.08.2017, which affirmed the Five Judge

Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Chettiar v. Chettiar

[2011] 2 Sri LR 70.

Appeal dismissed. No costs.
