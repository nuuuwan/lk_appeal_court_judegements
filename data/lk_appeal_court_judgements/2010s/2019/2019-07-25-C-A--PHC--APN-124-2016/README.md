The Commissioner of Labour as the complainant has instituted

this action in the Magistrates Court of Wattala against the

present petitioner, Pradeshiya Sabha of Wattala, by filing the

Certificate marked P1 under section 38(2) of the Employees

Provident Fund Act to recover unpaid Employment Provident

Fund contributions for a former employee of the Pradeshiya

Sabha. The learned Magistrate has dismissed the action by

order dated 29.08.2014. Then the Commissioner of Labour has

made an application before the High Court to have the said

order revised. As the Pradeshiya Sabha was absent and

unrepresented on two consecutive dates of argument, i.e.

09.02.2016 and 11.05.2016, the High Court has heard the

counsel for the Commissioner of Labour and delivered the

Judgment ex parte on 14.06.2016 setting aside the Magistrates

Court order.

The Pradeshiya Sabha has filed this revision application before

this Court on 30.09.2016 seeking to set aside the above ex parte

Judgment as the main relief.

It is the complaint of the Pradeshiya Sabha that the Judgment

should not have been delivered ex parte because the counsel

could not be present in Court on the aforementioned first date of

argument due to ill-health, and on the second date, as no notice

was received.

If the counsel was ill on the date of the argument, he could have

informed it to the Court and moved for a postponement. This

has not been done. However the Court has, according to the

Journal Entry dated 09.02.2016, issued notice on the

3

Pradeshiya Sabha and re-fixed the matter for argument for

11.05.2016. I must state that once the case is fixed for the

argument in the presence of both parties, there is no legal

requirement to reissue notice, if one party is absent. Hence the

submission that the Pradeshiya Sabha was not represented on

the aforesaid second date of argument because no notice was

served on the Pradeshiya Sabha is outrageous. However,

according to the Journal Entry dated 11.05.2016, notice had in

fact been issued on the Pradeshiya Sabha.

Be that as it may, the Pradeshiya Sabha, in paragraph 22 of the

petition states that, its Attorney filed an application before the

High Court by way of petition and affidavit on 14.07.2016

seeking to relist the matter for argument but the High Court

Judge refused that application by order dated 20.07.2016. The

alleged true copies of the said petition and affidavit have been

marked as P9A and P9B, and a certified copy of the said order as

P10.

However no Journal Entry has been produced confirming that

such a relisting application was made to the High Court. I

cannot accept P9A and P9B as true copies of the petition and

affidavit tendered to the High Court. P9A petition is undated

and tampered with by making various personal notes on it. P9B

affidavit is also undated and unsigned. They can no way be

regarded as true copies of the originals. At the argument on

02.07.2019 when the question was posed why certified copies of

the alleged petition and affidavit were not tendered to this Court,

the learned counsel for the petitioner stated that no such

relisting application filed by way of petition and affidavit could

be found in the High Court case. Then this Court has to

4

conclude that no proper relisting application was filed by the

petitioner before the High Court for the High Court to consider

that application.

Even assuming without conceding that P10 is the order refusing

the properly made relisting application, not a single word has

been mentioned by the petitioner in this revision application why

the petitioner could not exercise his right of appeal against that

order within time.

One cannot invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court

by way of revision as of right. Revision is a discretionary

remedy. When a right of appeal is available against a Judgment

or order, a party who did not exercise that right is ought to give

an explanation in his application why he did not exercise that

right in the event he decides to come before the Appellate Court

by way of revision instead of appeal.

Let me now advert to the merits of the petitioners application.

The learned Magistrate has dismissed the Commissioner

Generals Case/Application/Certificate as the incumbent

Chairman of the Provincial Council is not liable to pay the whole

amount stated in the Certificate as he was not the Chairman for

the entire period during which Employment Provident Fund

contributions are in arrears. The learned Magistrate has

allowed to file a fresh Certificate giving a breakdown of

Employment Provident Fund contributions under different

Chairmen. It is this order of the learned Magistrate the High

Court has set aside.

At the argument when the question was posed to the learned

counsel for the petitioner whether, according to him, the learned

5

Magistrates conclusion was correct, the learned counsel was

prevaricating. Thereafter the learned counsel stated that, if the

case was filed against the Pradeshiya Sabha of Wattala, in terms

of section 2(2) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, as the Pradeshiya

Sabha of Wattala is a juristic person, the entire Employment

Provident Fund contributions could have been recovered from

the Pradeshiya Sabha of Wattala Fund and the Certificate to

that extent would have been in order. However it was the

submission of the learned counsel that the Commissioner of

Labour filed the Certificate not against the Pradeshiya Sabha of

Wattala but against the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha of

Wattala, which is bad in law. However when I peruse the

Certificate in the course of writing this Judgement it is clear to

me that the Commissioner of Labour filed the Certificate in the

Magistrates Court not against the Chairman of the Pradeshiya

Sabha of Wattala but against the Pradeshiya Sabha of Wattala.

Vide the copy of the Certificate filed with the petition marked P1,

which is found at page 51 of the Brief.

Learned counsel for the Pradeshiya Sabha admits that, in terms

of section 132(p) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, such Employment

Provident Fund contributions can be paid by Pradeshiya Sabha

Fund established by each Pradeshiya Sabha without making it a

personal responsibility of the Chairmen. Section 132(p) reads as

follows:

There shall be paid out of the Pradeshiya Sabha Fund

established by each Pradeshiya Sabha all expenses

incurred by the Pradeshiya Sabha or by the Chairman or

the Secretary or any other officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha

on behalf of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the exercise of its

6

powers and the discharge of its functions and duties under

this Act or other written law or any by-law, rule or

regulation, made the under.

This application for revision is clearly devoid of merit. I dismiss

the application with costs.
