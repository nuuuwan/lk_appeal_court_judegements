This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Uva Province holden in

Badulla dated 10.06.2011.

Page 3 of 7

The Petitioners-Appellants (Appellants) filed the above styled application in the High Court of the

Uva Province holden in Badulla and sought a writ of mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd

Respondents-Respondents (1st and 2nd Respondents) to issue a license for a club in favour of

Badulla Sports Club for the years 2007 and 2008. The club was situated at No.9 Race Course

Road, Badulla.

During the pendency of this application steps were taken under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended to take over possession of the land on which the

clubhouse was situated. The learned High Court Judge held that since possession of the land was

taken over it was futile to issue a writ of mandamus as prayed for in the petition and dismissed

the application without costs. Hence this appeal.

The learned President's Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned High Court Judge

erred in dismissing the application on the grounds of futility as the rights of the parties must be

determined as at the date of institution of proceedings.

Rights of the Parties

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant was correct in submitting that there is a general

principle that the rights of the parties must be determined as at the date of institution of

proceedings or action. [Ponnammah v. Arumugam (8 N.L.R. 223 at 226), Silva v. Nona Hamine

(10 N.L.R. 44), Ponnamma v. Weerasuriya (11 N.L.R. 217), Silva v. Fernando et al (15 N.L.R. 499),

Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo et al (22 N.L.R. 268 at 272), Shariff et al v. Marikkar et al

(27 N.L.R. 349), Eminona v. Mohideen (32 N.L.R. 145), De Silva et al v. Goonetilleke et al (32 N.L.R.

217), De Silva v. Edirisuriya (41 N.L.R. 457), Lenorahamy v. Abraham (43 N.L.R. 68), Kader

Mohideen & Co. Ltd., v. Gany ( 60 N.L.R. 16), Abayadeera and 162 others v. Dr. Stanley

Wijesundera, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo and another (1983) 2 Sri. L. R. 267), Talagune

v. De Livera (1997) 1 Sri. L. R. 253, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd. and others v. Minister of Labour and

Vocational Training and others (1998) 1 Sri. L. R. 235, Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank (1998) 3

Sri. L. R. 197, Jayaratne v. Jayaratne and another (2002) 3 Sri. L. R. 331, Sithy Makeena and others

v. Kuraisha and others (2006) 2 Sri. L. R. 341].

However, it is not an immutable principle and courts have recognized certain exceptions to the

general rule.

In Sabapathipil/ai et 01 v. Vaithialingam {40 N.L.R. 107} it was held that a trustee whose term of

office expired during the pendency of an action brought by him, is not entitled to continue the

action. Similar approach was taken in Appusinno v. 8alasuriya {16 N.L.R. 385} by Ennis J. when

he held that the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance gave no power to appoint a provisional

trustee when the office became vacant by expiration of time, that the plaintiff had no status to

continue the action the moment he ceased to be trustee and that the principle that a case must

be decided as at the time of the institution of the suit cannot be applied to this case.

In Thangavadivel v. Inthiravathy {53 N.L.R. 369} where proceedings by way of summary

procedure under section 10 of the Jaffna Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance were

instituted by a wife against her husband for the return of certain jewelry, but while the inquiry

was proceeding, a decree absolute was entered in a divorce case dissolving the marriage between

the spouses, it was held that the plaintiff, having ceased to be the wife of the defendant during

the pendency of the inquiry, lost her status to continue the proceedings and the general rule that

the claims of the litigants are to be ascertained as at the commencement of the action would not

be applicable in such a case. In Mariam Nurban Hussain Teyabal/y v. Hon. R. Premadasa and two

others [S.c. No. 69/92, S.C.M. 05.11.1993] G.P.S. De Silva c.J. held {at page 5} that the general

principle of law that the right of parties are determined as at the date of action has no application

in the statutory context. In Master Divers (Pvt) Ltd. v. Karunaratne and others rCA {PHC} APN

140/2012, CAM. 09.08.2018] I held that when entering judgment in a foreign currency the rupee

value at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment together with legal interest should

also be entered therein.

Accordingly, I will now consider whether the general principle set out above applies to the instant

case or whether there is an exception that applies to it.

It is true that when the Appellants filed the application in the High Court of the Uva Province

holden in Badulla on 27.09.2007 the Badulla Sports Club was situated at No.9 Race Course Road,

Badulla. However, 604 dated 14.03.2007 shows that the 2nd Respondent had decided at its

monthly meeting held on 09.03.2007 to retake possession of the land on which the clubhouse

was situated. Further letter dated 18.06.2009 (604q) shows that the Municipal Commissioner,

Badulla Municipal Council had taken steps to invoke the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act for the land on which the clubhouse was situated. Thus, steps were being

contemplated to recover possession of the land in dispute prior to the institution of the

proceedings in the High Court by the Appellants.

Moreover, on or about 23.10.2008 the Appellants had sought interim relief in the same

application after proceedings were instituted under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

seeking to prevent the p t and 2nd Respondents from taking possession of the land in dispute. It

appears that the Appellants were not successful in this application. Possession of the land on

which the clubhouse was situated was taken over by the p t and 2nd Respondents as a result of

the proceedings instituted under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

In view of the above circumstances, I hold that the general principle that the rights of the parties

must be determined as at the date of institution of proceedings or action has no application to

the instant case. Where the rights of the parties, have been changed as a result of legal

proceedings, like in this case where the possession of the land on which the clubhouse was

situated was taken over by the p t and 2nd Respondents through judicial procedure, the general

principle has no application.

Futility

A writ of mandamus has been refused by Courts on several occasions on the ground of futility.

[Sethu Ramasamy v. Moregoda (63 N.L.R. 115), Shamsudeen v. The Minister of Defence and

External Affairs (63 N.L.R. 430), Abdul Rahuman v. Mayor of Colombo (69 N.L.R. 211), The Eksath

Engineru Saha Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya v. De Silva (73 N.L.R. 260), Samarasinghe v. De Mel

and another (1982) 1 Sri. L. R. 123, 128].

The relief sought by the Appellants namely issue of a writ of mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd

Respondents to issue a licence for a club in favour of Badulla Sports Club for the years 2007 and

2008 became futile as soon as Badulla Sports Club lost possession of the clubhouse situated at

No.9 Race Course Road, Badulla as a result of the proceedings instituted under the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act. In fact, a revision application against the ejectment order made in

the said proceedings was made to the High Court in Case No. 149/2010 (Rev) which was

dismissed. Against the said dismissal an appeal was preferred to this Court in case no. CA{PHC)

159/2010 which was dismissed on 14.02.2019.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Uva Province holden in Badulla dated 10.06.2011.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
