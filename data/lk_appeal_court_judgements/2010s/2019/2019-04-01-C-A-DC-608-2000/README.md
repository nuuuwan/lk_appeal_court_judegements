Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the 1st defendant against the

Judgment of the District Court entered in a partition action. He

raised a corpus dispute and a pedigree dispute at the trial. After

trial, the learned District Judge held against him on both

matters.

The plaintiff filed the action to partition the land known as

Tennedeniyahena alias Pangollehena bounded on the North by

the limit of Nagolla now owned by E.D. Baladewa, South by the

fence of Weliketiyahena belonging to Sawwa, East by the limit of

Tennedeniyecumbura belonging to Pansala and Lapaya and

West by limit of Weliketiyehena belonging to Podda and

Gansabawa Road in extent of one Amunam or five Pelas of

paddy sowing area between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.

Preliminary Plan No. 220 prepared by Welivita, L.S. depicts a

land in extent 1 Acre and 27 Perches.1

According to the 1st defendant one Amunam or five Pelas of

paddy sowing area equals to 2 Acres. On that basis the 1st

defendant got Plan No. 1635 of Kiridena, L.S. prepared depicting

a land in extent of 2 Acres 3 Roods and 24 Perches.2 This has

been done by adding a portion (shown as Lot 2) to Plan No.220,

from the southern boundary.3 According to the Report of Plan

1635, Lot 2 is completely covered with cinnamon plantation.4

That part is possessed by the 2nd defendant, and it is on that

footing, the 2nd defendant intervened in the action after the

preparation of Plan No.1635.

Both the surveyors, Welivita and Kiridena, have died pending

action and therefore Plan Nos. 16875 and 61586 have later been

prepared respectively on the lines of the previous Plans.

After trial, the learned District Judge accepted the Preliminary

Plan No. 220 as the Plan correctly depicting the corpus. In the

facts and circumstances of this case, that finding is correct.

The land to be partitioned is a land in extent of one Amunam or

five Pelas of paddy sowing area. The 1st defendant was not

satisfied with the Preliminary Plan because 2 Acre land was

not shown in that Plan. That shall not be a ground to reject the

Preliminary Plan, if the other circumstances do not support

such a view.

There is no hard and fast rule that one Amunam or five Pelas of

paddy sowing area shall necessarily equal to 2 Acres.

In Ratnayake v. Kumarihamy [2005] 1 Sri LR 303 the plaintiff

wanted to partition a land of 4 Lahas of Kurakkan sowing area.

The Preliminary Plan showed a land in extent of 8 Acres 1 Rood

and 16 Perches. The contesting defendants sought dismissal of

the action inter alia on the basis that 1 Laha sowing extent

equals to 1 Acre, and the Preliminary Plan shows a land far in

excess of the land described in the schedule to the plaint, and

therefore the land has not been properly identified. This

argument was rejected both by this Court and the Supreme

Court. The Supreme Court at 308-309 observed that land

5 Page 389 of the brief. 6 Page 454 of the brief.

measures computed on the basis of land required to be sown with

Kurakkan vary from district to district depending on the fertility of

soil and quality of grain and in the said circumstances difficult to

correlate the sowing extent with accuracy. Thus there cannot be a

definite basis for the contention that 1 Laha sowing extent be it

Kurakkan or even paddy would be equivalent to 1 acre.

As the learned District Judge has stated in the Judgment the

land has to be identified more by the boundaries than by the

extent. The southern boundary of the land to be partitioned is

Weliketiyahena. This is shown in the Preliminary Plan.

According to the 1st defendants Plan No.1635, the southern

boundary is Gamsaba Road. The 1st defendant himself has

admitted in evidence that the southern boundary of the land to

be partitioned is Welliketiyehena possessed by the 2nd

defendant.7

Hence the pivotal argument of the learned counsel for the 1st

defendant fails.

The learned counsel for the 1st defendant in appeal raised the

point that Tennedeniyahena and Pangollehena are two different

lands, and latter land has been introduced to claim more rights.

Such a clear position has not been taken up by the 1st defendant

by way of an issue at the trial. In some of the plaintiffs deeds,

the land has been described as Tennedeniyahena alias

Pangollehena. This argument is clearly not a genuine one

because the 1st defendants effort from the beginning was to

expand the corpus and not to shrink it. I reject that argument.

The pedigree dispute of the 1st defendant is also baseless.

According to the pedigree of the plaintiff, the original owner

Sethuwa had four children including Wasthuwa. This was

admitted by the 1st defendant in the 1st and 2nd statements of

claim8 and also in evidence.9 The 1st defendant now says that

Wasthuwa is not a child of Sethuwa because Wasthuwas

surname is different from that of Sethuwa in the deeds. That is

not a ground to rule out an already admitted fact.

The appeal is manifestly devoid of merit. I dismiss the appeal

with costs fixed at Rs.50,000/= payable by the 1st defendant to

the 2nd defendant.
