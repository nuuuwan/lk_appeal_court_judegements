Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner-appellant filed this action in the District Court

seeking to admit the last will of her deceased mother to probate.

This was objected to by her two siblings who were made

respondents to the case. After trial, the learned District Judge

held that the will has not been proved. This appeal by the

petitioner-appellant is against that Judgment.

It is well settled law that the onus is on the propounder of the

will to remove all suspicious circumstances attached to the will

and prove affirmatively that it is the will of a free and capable

testator.

The learned District Judge has taken the view that the petitioner

who is the executrix and the sole beneficiary of the last will has

not removed all doubts attached to the will to the satisfaction of

the Court.

The main doubt has arisen regarding execution of the last will

itself. The notary in her evidence has stated that she did not

know the testator before. Then how and why the testator

selected this notary has not been satisfactorily explained. The

two attesting witnesses to the last will are not relatives or friends

of the testator. They are servants or workers of the father of the

notary who has an estate.

There are admittedly several erasers, interpolations etc. on a

number of important matters in the body of the last will which

are not reflected in the attestation.

More importantly, there is only one property which the testator

has intended to bequeath to the petitioner-appellant. That has

3

been described in the last will as the share or shares what I will

get from High Court of Chilaw Case No.20206. It is the position

of the petitioner-appellant that this refers to the District Court of

Marawila Partition Case No. 204/P. The last will does not refer

to a partition case in the District Court. It refers to a case in the

High Court. The intention of the testatrix is not clear. Learned

counsel for the appellant himself has identified this as a patent

mistake in the last will drafted by the notary public1 but says

that it is excusable as she is not an attorney at law. The notary

shall first understand what the testatrix proposes to bequeath

by way of the last will and thereafter explain it to the testatrix

before the testatrix places her signature to the last will. This

does not mean that the notary shall investigate title of the

properties to be bequeathed. Had this been done, the notary

could not have made such a blatant mistake. If the notary tried

to understand what the intention of the testator was, she could

have (as an experienced notary) probably suggested the testatrix

to simply execute a deed instead of a last will. There is no

prohibition, pending partition, to transfer to another whatever

the interests a party would get from the final decree of partition.

In fact, it is the evidence of the first attesting witness of the last

will that what was executed was not a last will but a deed. The

second attesting witness of the last will has not been called as

he was said to be dead. According to the evidence of the notary2,

she has had 11 years of experience when she executed this last

will and by that time 4816 instruments have been notarially

executed by her. It is difficult to believe that a notary of such a

4

caliber does not have a knowledge of very basic matters in

lawat least partition actions are not filed in the High Court.

The Examiner of Questioned Documents has stated that he is

unable to express an opinion on the genuineness of the

signature of the testatrix appearing on the last will.

Another suspicious circumstance is the delay of four years in

filing the testamentary case after the death of the testatrix. The

explanation of the petitioner-appellant that due to financial

constraints she could not file the case early is not very

convincing.

The matter in issue is essentially a question of fact and not of

law. The Judgment has been delivered by the District Judge

before whom all the evidence at the trial has been led. Appellate

Court will be very slow to interfere with the findings of the trial

judge based on evidence led before him unless there are

compelling reasons to do so. I find no such compelling reasons

in this case.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
