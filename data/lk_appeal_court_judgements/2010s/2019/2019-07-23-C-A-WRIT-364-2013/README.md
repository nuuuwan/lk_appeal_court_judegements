Factual Matrix

The following facts pertaining to this application emerge from the pleadings. Having

obtained the B.Sc Business Administration (Special) Degree from the University of Sri

]ayawardanapura, on 15.09.1992, the Petitioner had joined the North Central Province

Affiliated College as an Instructor in Computer Technology (Grade II).

On a decision taken by the government, the affiliated University Colleges in the Central,

North Western and North Central Provinces were amalgamated and the 1st Respondent-

Rajarata University of Sri Lanka was established on 07.11.1997. The Petitioner had been

absorbed into the newly established university in his capacity as an Instructor in

Computer Technology (Grade II).

Whilst working as an Instructor in Computer Technology, the Petitioner went on to

obtain his Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Technology from the University of

Colombo in 1997. Thereafter he secured his promotion as an Instructor in Computer

Technology (Grade I) with effect from 15.09.1997.

It is in terms of Section 71 of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978 as amended by the

Universities (Amendment) Act No.7 of 1985 (Universities Act) every appointment to a

post of teacher shall be made subject to such requirements or conditions in the approved

scheme of recruitment and the procedures for appointment prescribed by rules. It is

under the mandate of Section 18 of the Universities Act as amended that rules and

circulars are often issued by the UGC and Circulars 721 of 21st November, 1997 and 842 of

30th April 2004 are but two examples of the exercise of this rule making power.

Circular No.721 which has been flagged as quintessentially applicable to the instant

application provides for the relevant scheme of recruitment applicable to the

appointment of a Lecturer (Probationary) and a Senior Lecturer Grade II. In a nutshell the

circular provides for the two types of appointments to be made and item (6) specifies as

to the qualifications that a teacher must possess in order to become a Senior Lecturer

Grade II. I will presently return to this circular once the other circulars have been

adverted to.

It would appear that having considered the requests made by those who were absorbed

from various Affiliated Colleges to the newly established Universities, the 19th

Respondent--UGC decided to appoint them as Lecturers (probationary) or Senior

Lecturers (Grade II) subject to fulfillment of certain conditions and the UGC Circular

842 (PI) dated 30th April 2004 was issued directing the Universities to make the

appointment on the basis stated below:--

"i. Lecturer (probationary):

As and when such Instructors in English and Educational Assistants have 7 years experience and

earn a Master Degree in the relevant field on one year jull--time or equivalent part--time duration

with or without a research component.

ii. Senior Lecturer (Grade II):

As and when such Instructors in English and Educational Assistants have 8 years experience and

earn a two years jull--time or equivalent part--time Master Degree with a significant component of

research in the relevant filed or nay other higher level degree."

The provisions made in the said circular 842 (PI) were effective from 01.05.2004 and as it

is apparent, Instructors in Computer Technology such as the Petitioner were not covered

by the Circular. In order to address the grievance of the instructors that they found

themselves ineligible to enter the mainstream of teachers due to the stringency of the

existing circulars, it would appear that the UGC--the 19th Respondent responded with

other circulars such as OS/2005, 06/2005 and 10/2000.

Establishment Circular No.OS/200S dated 29th March 2005 rescinded Circular 842 but

did not cater to the instructors in Computer Technology. Establishment Circular No.

06/2005 dated 29th April 2005 amended Circular No.OS/200S but is not relevant for the

purposes of this application as it catered only to instructors in English, Educational

Assistants and Engineering Teaching Assistants as did Circular No.OS/200S.

Instructors in Computer Technology were afforded an opportunity on par with the

aforesaid category of the instructors in English, Educational Assistants and Engineering

5

Teaching Assistants by way of the next circular that followed namely Circular No.lO of

2009 dated 13th November 2009.

According to the circular the aforesaid category which included Instructors in Computer

Technology was required to apply for academic positions in response to open

advertisements published by their respective Higher Educational Institutions.

The provisions of this circular were operative concurrently along with Establishment

Circulars No.OS/200S and 06/2005. Upon their rescission, these circulars ceased to be

operative from 29.03.2011

In any event during the time that Circular No.lO of 2009 was in operation, it enabled

Instructors in Computer Technology such as the Petitioner to apply to become Lecturers

(Probationary) or Senior Lecturers (Grade II).

Subsequently the UGC informed all Higher Educational Institutions that the UGC must

receive recommendations in respect of appointments of Instructors in Computer

Technology to either position referred to above. The Petitioner did make the application

to enter the academic stream and after an abortive selection committee which had first

interviewed the Petitioner, the UGC directed that a second Selection Committee be

reconvened and a fresh recommendation forwarded. In fact the constitution of the

Selection Committee is specified in paragraph 7(2) of the Commission Circular No.l66 of

06.04.1982 and accordingly the 2nd Selection Committee having evaluated the professional

experience and performance recommended to the U GC that the Petitioner be appointed

to the post of Senior Lecturer Grade II. But the UGC did not adopt the recommendation

but chose to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Lecturer (Probationary) on personal to

the holder basis having taken into account the Petitioner's academic and professional

qualifications and experience under the 4th category of qualification for the post of

Lecturer (Probationary) as set out in the UGC Circular No.721 dated 21st November 1997.

The said decision of the UGC was notified to the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka by

letter dated 03rd December 2008 and the appointment of the Petitioner to the Post of

6

Lecturer (Probationary) accordingly had been made under the hand of the Vice

Chancellor of the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka based on the said decision of the UGC.

After having perused the decision of the UGC to approve the appointment of the

Petitioner to the post of Lecturer (probationary) vis--a--vis the criteria set out in the UGC

Circular No.721 with regard to the Scheme of Recruitment pertaining to the post of

Lecturer (Probationary), Senior Lecturer (Grade II), and Senior Lecturer (Grade I) of the

University or an Institute of Higher Education, I hold the view that the decision of the

U GC cannot be faulted. It was the contention of the Respondents that the Petitioner is

not measure up to the strict terms of the scheme of recruitment as he did not have a

degree with specialization in Computer Science and notwithstanding the absence of such

a degree in the relevant field, the UGC had considered the Diploma in Computer

Technology which the Petitioner had and took the decision to grant approval to appoint

him to the post of Lecturer (probationary) in Computer Science. In the letter that the

U GC wrote to the Vice Chancellor giving the approval to appoint the Petitioner to the

post of Lecturer (probationary), the U GC specifically stated that the Petitioner had not

fulfilled the requirements in the scheme of recruitment for appointment to the post of

Senior Lecturer (Grade II). It is this decision not to appoint the Petitioner to the post of

Senior Lecturer (Grade II) that this Petitioner impugns in these proceedings and he also

seeks a mandamus compelling the UGC to approve the recommendation made by the

University and appoint him to the position of Senior Lecturer.

Upon a perusal of the criteria necessary to become a Senior Lecturer (Grade II), I find that

the U GC Circular 721 requires a higher qualification than that stipulated for a Lecturer

(probationary). The UGC Circular 721 in Item 6 specifies a Post Graduate degree in the

relevant field obtained after a full--time course of study of at least 2 academic years

duration in addition to the 1

st degree in the relevant field. Thus it is clear that without

even a first degree in Computer Science, the Petitioner cannot entertain a legitimate

expectation that he should be accorded with the position of a Senior Lecturer (Grade II).

A mere hope cannot give rise to a legitimate expectation and no administrative body can

be said to have dashed the substantive legitimate expectation of a petitioner when criteria

7

for conferral of a substantive benefit have been published but the petitioner has failed to

fulfil those criteria. Substantive legitimate expectation, if at all, would be referable to the

representations given as criteria in the circular and if one fails to meet the stipulations in

the circulars for the securing of a substantive benefit, one cannot complain that the

administrative functionary has disappointed the legitimate expectations--see R v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Khan (1984) 1 WLR 1337; R v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p Ruddock (1987) 1 WLR 1482; R v.

Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food ex p Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries Ltd

(1995) 2 All ER 714; R v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan

(2001) QB 213.

The Petitioner accepted the appointment as a Lecturer (Probationary) on the nth of

December 2008 and has been consistently agitating for posting as a Senior Lecture Grade

II before the Human Rights Commission and the University Services Appeals Board.

By order dated 14.05.2013, the University Services Appeals Board (USAB) dismissed the

appeal of the Petitioner. In this application for judicial review, the Petitioner has also

sought a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the USAB. I do not find any illegality,

irrationality or procedural impropriety as vitiating factors that would taint any of the

decisions sought to be impugned in these proceedings and the fact that the UGC relaxed

the requirements specified for the appointment of a Lecturer (Probationary) when it came

to the appointment of this Petitioner shows that the U GC had kept its mind open as

regards the rules stipulated in their own Circular and was even prepared to depart from

their rule in regard to this Petitioner when he did not even have the requirement of a basic

degree in Computer Science. That shows that the UGC had not fettered its discretion--

British Oxygen v. Minister of Technology (1971) AC 610; (1970) 3 All ER 165 (HL).

In the circumstances, I take the view that the Petitioner has not made out a case for

Judicial Review and I therefore proceed to dismiss this application.
