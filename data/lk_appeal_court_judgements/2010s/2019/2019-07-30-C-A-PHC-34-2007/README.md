Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The appellants filed this appeal against the Judgment of the High

Court whereby the order of the Magistrates Court was set aside on

the sole basis that the Magistrates Court can exercise jurisdiction

in a section 66 application provided the first information under

section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No.44 of 1979,

is filed in Court within two months from the date of the dispute. In

the instant case, according to the High Court Judge, as the first

information has not been filed within two months from the date of

the dispute, the Magistrates Court did not have jurisdiction to

entertain the application. This is completely a misdirection in law

on the part of the High Court Judge.

The High Court correctly held that the dispute relates to a right of

way and therefore the matter has to be decided in terms of section

69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The identification of the difference between section 68 and 69 is

important. Section 68 applies when the dispute is in regard to

possession of a land. Section 69 applies when the dispute is in

regard to an entitlement of any other right, such as, right to

cultivate, right to a servitude etc.

3

The two-month period is applicable when the dispute is in relation

to possession of a land. Under section 68(1), the Court shall

confirm the possession of the party who was in possession of the

land on the date of the filing of the first information in Court. That

is the general rule. This is subject to an exception as provided for

in section 68(3). That is, if the opposite party can prove that he

was forcibly dispossessed by his opponent who is now in

possession of the land within two months immediately before the

filing of the first information, he shall be restored in possession.

This two-month time limit has nothing to do with other rights

contemplated in section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is relevant to note that the order under section 68 regarding

possession can be made without reference to the merits of the

claims of the parties. Conversely, when the order is under section

69, it shall be made upon consideration of the merits of the rival

claims. However I must emphatically emphasize that this shall not

be taken to mean that when the dispute is regarding a right other

than possession, the Magistrate shall convert the inquiry into a

full-scale District Court civil trial. The orders which are made both

under section 68 and 69 are provisional until the matter is

determined by a competent civil Court.

In the Supreme Court case of Loku Banda v. Ukku Banda1, decided

under the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, where

similar but not identical provisions are found2, Soza J., explained

the law in this regard in the following terms.

When the dispute relates to possession the Magistrate must

determine who was in possession on the date when he issued

notice on his having reason to believe that there was in

existence a dispute affecting land and likely to cause a breach

of the peace or within two months prior to the issue of such

notice where a forcible dispossession has occurred. The order

which the Magistrate then makes will declare which of the

disputants is entitled to possession and prohibit all

disturbance to his possession until he is evicted under the

judgment, order or decree of a competent court. Where there

has been forcible dispossession within the period of two

months prior to the date of the issue of notice the Magistrate

may in addition to such declaration and prohibition, direct

that the party specified in his order be restored to possession.

When the dispute relates to possession, the Magistrate may

make his determination without reference to the merits of the

rival claims of the parties - see the proviso to subsection 7 of

section 63 [of the Administration of Justice Law].

Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or part of a

land other than the right to possession, the Magistrate will

declare that the person named in his order is entitled to the

disputed right until he is deprived of it by virtue of the

judgment of a competent court and prohibit all disturbance or

interference with the exercise of such right other than under

the authority of such judgment. The proviso to subsection 7 of

section 63 does not apply here. Hence by implication the

Magistrate would have to consider the merits of the rival

claims in deciding who is entitled to the disputed right. This

he will do on the basis of the material before him.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court and restore the order of

the Magistrates Court.

Appeal is allowed. No costs.
