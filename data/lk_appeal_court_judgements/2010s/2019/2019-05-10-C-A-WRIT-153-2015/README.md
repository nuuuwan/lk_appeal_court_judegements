Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application against the two respondents,

the District Secretary (Government Agent) and the Divisional

Secretary of Mannar respectively, basically seeking a writ of

prohibition prohibiting the respondents from proceeding with

the inquiry referred to in P3. P3 is a letter written by the

Divisional Secretary to the petitioner stating inter alia that Upon

a complaint made by Mr. Sivakumar Namasivayam, an elected

member of the Board of Trustees, and others, the Government

Agent, Manner has appointed me as the Commissioner in terms of

section 102(4) of the Trusts Ordinance to inquire into the said

complaint. The complaint referred to in P3 has been marked

as P11. This complaint is not a plaint. According to section

102(3) of the Trusts Ordinance, what the Commissioner shall

inquire into is not the complaint, but the subject-matter of the

plaint. In Velautham v. Velauther (1957) 61 NLR 230 at 231-232

Basnayake C.J. stated that the commissioners cannot make

such a report unless the plaint is annexed to the petition

presented to the Government Agent. Admittedly, no such plaint

has been annexed to the complaint/petition sent by

Namasivayam and others to the Government Agent.

Section 102(3) reads as follows:

No action shall be entertained under this section unless the

plaintiffs shall have previously presented a petition to the

Government Agent of the Administrative District in which

such place or establishment is situate praying for the

appointment of a commissioner or commissioners to inquire

3

into the subject-matter of the plaint, and unless the

Government Agent shall have certified that an inquiry has

been held in pursuance of the said petition, and that the

commissioner or commissioners (or a majority of them) has

reported(a) that the subject-matter of the plaint is one that

calls for the consideration of the court; and (b) either that it

has not proved possible to bring about an amicable

settlement of the questions involved, or that the assistance

of the court is required for the purpose of giving effect to any

amicable settlement that has been arrived at.

Section 102(4) reads as follows:

It shall be the duty of the Government Agent, in any case in

which he shall have good reason to believe that the persons

presenting such petition or any five of them are persons

interested within the meaning of subsection (2) of this

section, for which purpose he may require to be satisfied by

affidavit or otherwise, to appoint for the purposes of the

inquiry a commissioner or commissioners whom he may

consider to be a person or persons of acknowledged

standing and repute in the general or local religious

community concerned;

Provided that the Government Agent may appoint himself

as the commissioner or as one of the commissioners;

Provided further, that the Government Agent may require

the petitioners to deposit with him an amount sufficient to

cover the reasonable expenses of the commissioner or

commissioners in respect of traveling expenses and

subsistence incidental to the inquiry prayed for and any

4

such costs certified by the Government Agent to have been

properly incurred for the purposes of the inquiry and to

have been duly paid shall be deemed to be costs in the

action.

The argument of the learned ASG that the plaint is necessary to

be tendered only if the complainant decides to go to Courts, and

there is no prohibition for the Government Agent/District

Secretary to hold an inquiry into any complaint as it might end

up in a settlement is devoid of merit. The inquiry under section

102 shall necessarily be on the subject-matter of the plaint.

I issue a writ of prohibition prohibiting the 1st and 2nd

respondents from taking further steps on the inquiry

contemplated in P3. No costs.
