M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. The Accused-Appellant

was indicted for committing the murder of Dissanayake Mudiyanselage

Siriyawathi on or about 6th July 2004. The deceased was a fifteen-year-old girl

living together with the Accused-Appellant as husband and wife. She was not

legally married to the Accused.

After the indictment was read, Accused pleaded not guilty and opted for a non-jury

trial (Vide page-000022 of the appeal brief). To prove the prosecution case,

prosecution led the evidence of several witnesses including Ambagahagedar

Punchibanda, Alhenegedara Bandara Menika, Ambagahagedara Wasanthi, JMO-

Dr. Dissanayake, and several Investigating Police officers.

The prosecution case was based on the evidence of the Accused-Appellants

mother and the sisters evidence. On the day of the incident Accused-Appellant

came home with the deceased and after sometime went to Accused-Appellant

house which was in the same compound.

After a short while Accused-Appellant had come and told his mother and sister

who were in the main house that Siriyawathi Maruwa. It doesn't reflect from

the case record that the deceaseds was in a distressed mood to hang herself. None

of the witnesses spoke about any argument or other misunderstanding between

the Accused- Appellant and the deceased.

Ambagahagedara Punchibanda (vide page: 000030) stated that after he came

home he was informed by his wife that his daughter in law was dead. He had

visited the scene (house of his son) and found the dead body of the deceased.

According to him, deceased face was covered with black cloth and \ there had been

a ligature hanging around her neck.

3

Punchibandas Son (Accused Appellant) had not been at home when he went.

When he met him he had asked him as to what had happened but his son had not

given any reply (page: 000036) This had been the observations of Punchibanda

with regard to the dead body as he was not at home when the incident took place.

Alhene Gedara Bandara Menika (page; 000038) Mother of the Accused-

Appellant, She said both the Accused -Appellant and the deceased had come home

on that day around 11.30 am. After meeting her, both of them had gone to Sunil's

house which is close by. Around 3.30 pm her son had come and informed her that

Siriyawanthi Maruwa (page: 000045).

Further giving evidence Bandara Menika said after saying Siriyawathi Meruwa her

son had told her that he was going to the Police Station and gone (page: 000047).

Badara Menika had gone towards her son's house and had observed the deceased

dead body. On the same day she had given a statement to the Police and later given

evidence at the Non-Summary and at the High Court Trial.

When perusing her evidence, she is consistent in her evidence. This is very rare

occasion that a mother giving evidence against the conduct of her own son.

Therefore, this Court will not consider her evidence very lightly. Even under cross

examination Bandara Menike is very consistent with regard to her evidence. No

contradictions or omissions had been marked throughout her evidence.

Further, even under cross examination when the Defence Counsel suggested to her

that her son had told,

Bandara Menike's evidence in all the aspects:

In this case, the Accused- Appellant Nimal Ratnayake is the son of Bandara Menike

and the brother of Wasanthi. Therefore, there is no issue with regard to the

identity of Accused -Appellant.

The doctor who performed the postmortem had also been called to give evidence at

the trail. According to him on 2004.07.06 the postmortem had been performed at

the Mahiyanganaya Base Hospital. Doctor had noted several injuries on her body. A

Doctor said injury pattern is consistent with the ligature strangulation. According

to the PMR findings the cause of death is due to strangulation by a ligature.

The conclusion of the Doctor who performed the Postmortem was that death due

to ligature strangulation.

After being informed of the incident Police had investigated the matter. When the

Police visited the house of the deceased they had observed the body and the face

were covered by the black cloth which had been taken in to custody. Statements of

witnesses had also been recorded.

Police had recorded the statement of the accused. After recording his statement, a

nylon rope had been found. The said nylon rope had been marked as P-05, and the

portion which lead to the finding of the nylon rope had also been marked as P-04.

Thus we come to the conclusion that the version of the prosecution witnesses is

corroborated by the Police Officers' investigations.

The Prosecution after leading evidence of several witnesses and marking P-01 to P-

06 closed the case for the prosecution. After conclusion of the prosecution case as

there was a prima-facie case against the Accused the Learned High Court Judge

had called for the defence.

For the defence Accused-Appellant opted to give a dock statement (page: 000079).

Accused in his dock statement stated that a person by the name of Karunaratna is

6

the person who is responsible for the death of the deceased. Accused further said

Karunaratna is the person who told him to surrender to the Police. This position

had never been suggested by any of the prosecution witnesses including the

investigating Police Officers.

In several decisions it had been held that absence of cross examination of

Prosecution witnesses of certain facts leads to inference of admission of that fact.

In the Indian Supreme Court decision of Motilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh

(1990) (CLJ NOC 125 MP) it was observed that:

Absence of cross examination of Prosecution Witnesses of certain facts leads to

inference of admission of that fact.

Furthermore, this principle is echoed in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka Krishantha

Kumara Tissera v. Attorney General (2007) and is in line with the approach

adopted by Indian Courts as well as evidenced by the decisions in Sarwan Singh v.

State of Punjab (2002) (AIR SC 111) where it was held that,

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail

himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must follow that the

evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted

We now consider the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant. When this Court

carefully peruse the dock statement, the position taken by the Accused-Appellant

at the trail and the dock statement its totally different. It appears to this Court

that the dock statement made by the Accused-Appellant is after thought. We have

perused the dock statement very carefully and decided to reject the same.

Thus, we come to the conclusion that the defence taken up by the Accused -

Appellant in his evidence is an afterthought and we reject the same.

7

After the prosecution and the defence submissions the learned High Court Judge

fixed the case for judgement.

After trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty of the indicted

charge levelled against the Accused- Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge convicted the Accused on 10.03.2011. After the

conviction the Learned High Court Judge had recorded the Allocutus as per

following the procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code.

When this matter came up for argument the learned counsel for the Accused

Appellant took up several defects in the High Court Trial.

Accordingly, the 1st defect was that, Learned High Court Judge erred in law by

perusing and relying upon the non-summary evidence of pw-01 at the time of

writing the judgement.

The 2nd defect was that, Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law on

the principles relating to section 27 of the evidence ordinance.

The 3rd defect was that; Learned High Court Judge was totally oblivious to the

fact that a mere non- confessionary utterance by the appellant had been converted

to a confessionary statement by the State Counsel thereby denying the appellant of

a fair trial.

The 4th defect was that; items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to

support the conviction.

The 5th defect was that, items of evidence favourable to the appellant have not

been considered by the Learned High Court Judge, there by denying the appellant

of a fair trial.

8

Before taking a decision with regard to this case we have carefully analyzed the

evidence and the submissions made by both counsel as well as the written

submissions tendered before us. We have taken in to consideration the above five

defects stated by the counsel for the Accused- Appellant. After perusing the case

record and the submissions made by both counsel we reject the submissions made

by Counsel for the Accused- Appellant with regard to the above defects

highlighted have no merit. Therefore, we reject the arguments made by l the

counsel for the Accused- Appellant.

Justice Thilakawardena, in The AG Vs. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa, (SC

Appeal 79/2008 SC minutes dated 06.05.2010) has observed that,

Discrepancies that do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic version of

the witness cannot be given too much importance.

It was further held in the case that,

Appellate courts are generally slow to interfere with the decisions of inferior courts

on questions of fact or oral testimony. The Privy Council has stated that appellate

court should not ordinarily interfere with the trial courts opinion as to the credibility

of a witness as the trial judge alone knows the demeanour of the witness; he alone can

appreciate the manner in which the questions are answered, whether with honest

candour or with doubtful plausibility and whether after careful thought or with

reckless glibness; and he alone can form a reliable opinion as to whether the witness

has emerged with credit from cross examination. (Also see: Valarshak Seth Apcar v.

Standard Coal Company Limited AIR (1943) PC 159).

When we peruse the case record the prosecution, in this case, had proved the guilt

of the Accused-Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The Trial Judge had evaluated

the prosecution evidence and arrived at the correct decision by convicting the

Accused-Appellant for the indicted charge of the Penal Code. The totality of the

9

evidence proved nothing beyond the guilt of the Accused-Appellant. The trial

Judge had correctly taken into consideration the seriousness of the crime

committed by the Accused- Appellant who had killed a young girl who was living

with the Accused. At the time of her death there is no evidence or suggestion that

that there was a fight. It appears that there had been no fight between the two.

A girl of young as fifteen years old had to leave this world as a result of the action

of the Accused. A young girl of fifteen should have been under her parent's love and

care. Instead of looking after her Accused had killed her. After the incident

Accused had gone to his mother's house and informed her that he killed

Siriyawathi and then gone to the Police. There are many areas which he had to

explained at the trial, but not done by the Accused-Appellant as per the

Ellenborough dictum. We also take this in to consideration when coming to a

finding against the Accused-Appellant.

Considering the evidence before us this Court is of the view that the Appeal of the

Accused-Appellant should be dismissed and the conviction of the Learned High

Court Judge is here by affirmed.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to issue a copy of this order to the Learned High Court

Judge of Badulla.
