When this application was taken up for argument on 19th June 2018, the

learned Counsel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce

judgment on the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

By an amended petition dated 19th September 2011, the Petitioner had sought

the following relief:

i .

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the 'grants' dated 16th November 2009

issued to Herath Mudiyanselage Dharmadasa under the provisions of the

Land Development Ord

1inance1;

b) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to issue a grant to the

Petitioner under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, in

I respect of the lands referred to in the documents marked 'P7' and 'PS'. 2

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that the State had issued the Petitioner's father,

Ambangaha Kumbure Herath Mudiyanselage Ukkurala, a permit in respect of a

high land and a paddy land: in the 1960's, under the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance (the Ordinance). A copy of the said permit has been

produced by the 1st Respondent marked 'Rl'. The Petitioner states further that

he had been nominated as the successor under the said permit by Ukkurala.

This Court observes that an endorsement has been made on the reverse of 'Rl'

nominating Herath Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda, who was one year of age at

that time, as the successor. This nomination has been registered on 20th March

1962 in the land ledger relating to this land, as borne out by an extract thereof,

produced by the 1st Respondent marked 'R2'. The Petitioner states that he

changed his name in 1987 from Herath Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda to Herath

Mudiyanselage Senaratne Banda and has annexed to the petition, marked 'P3',

a copy of the birth certificate which confirms the amendment to the name.

1 The Petitioner has annexed to the petition, marked 'P7' and 'P8', two letters issued by the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary, Lankapura to the Registrar of Lands of Polonnaruwa requesting that the name of Herath Mudiyanselage Dharmadasa be registere'd as the successor to two grants issued in the name of Dharmadasa's father, Ambangaha Kumbure Herath Mudiyanselage Ukkurala.

I .

In January 1983, the Government had issued Ukkurala a grant under the

provisions of Section 19(4) of the Ordinance, read with Section 19(6) thereof, , .

in respect of the aforementioned high land in extent of 2A 3R lP. A copy of the

said grant has been annexed to the petition, marked 'PI/. In May 1986, the

Government had issued Ukkurala a further grant under the provisions of

Section 19(4) of the Ordinance, read with Section 19(6) thereof, in respect of

the aforementioned paddy land in extent of 4A 3R 38P. A copy of the said

grant has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P2/. It is admitted between

the parties that Ukkurala did not make a fresh nomination of a successor,

under either of the two grants 'PI' or 'P2/. Thus, the said nomination of the

Petitioner continued to be valid, under the grants as wel1.3

Ukkurala had passed away on 13th April 1991, while his widow, Lokumenike

had passed away on 1st May 2007. It is an admitted fact that Ukkurala and his

wife had 10 children. Herath Mudiyanselage Dharmadasa, the late husband of

the 6th Respondent and the father of the 7th - 10th Respondents, was the eldest

son of Ukkurala and his wife.

The issue that arises in this application is, who is entitled to succeed to the

grants 'PI' and 'P2' issued to Ukkurala. Chapter VII of the Ordinance contains

provisions with regard to succession under a permit or holding. In terms of

Section 48B of the Ordinance, upon the death of Ukkurala, his spouse

Lokumenike was entitled to succeed to the said lands. In terms of Section 68(1)

of the Ordinance, if Lokumenike refuses to succeed or does not enter into

3 See the judgment of the Supreme Court in Mallehe Widanaralalage Don Dayaratne vs Mallehe Widanaralalage Don Agosinno and four others [SC Appeal No.30/2004; SC Minutes of 23'd March 2005] followed by this Court in Abeysinghe Arachchige Asoka vs Rajapakse, Commissioner General of Lands rCA (Writ) Application No. 208/2013; CA Minutes of 2nd September 2016].

possession of the land within a period of 6 months from the date of the death

of Ukkurala, that will amount to a failure to succeed by Lokumenike. In such an

event, in terms of Section 49 of the Ordinance, the Petitioner, being the

nominated successor of Ukkurala under the permit 'Rl' was entitled to

succeed to the holding and the Petitioner ought to have taken steps to succeed

to the said lands, upon Lokumenike failing to succeed. In terms of Section 68(2)

of the Ordinance, if the Petitioner refuses to succeed to the land or the

Petitioner does not enter into possession within 6 months of the date from

which Lokumenike failed to succeed, that shall tantamount to a failure by the

Petitioner to succeed to the said land.

This Court shall now consider if the Petitioner took steps in terms of the law to

exercise his rights as a nominee and succeed to the lands in question.

The Petitioner states in paragraph 6 of the petition that he and the "other

brothers and sisters, except the deceased brother" had been in continuous

occupation of the lands covered by the said grants, even after the death of

both parents and that this was the position that prevailed even at the time this

1 application was filed. This Court observes that the 6th - 10th Respondents have

admitted this pOSition of the Petitioner in their Statement of Objections. The

fact that the Petitioner and five of his siblings are occupying the high land4 and

the fact that the Petitioner and two othersS are in possession of the paddy land

is borne out by the letters dated 21st October 2010 written by the Grama

Niladhari of Gemunupura, annexed to the petition marked 'P29' and 'P30',6

respectively.

4 The siblings of the Petitioner have not been made parties to this application.

S These two persons have not been made parties to this application.

6 According to 'P30', the Petitioner is in occupation of an extent of 3A of the paddy land.

6

The Petitioner has not plac:!d any material before this Court with regard to

I what transpired in respect of the said high land and the paddy land, from the

time that Ukkurala passed away in 1991 until 2009 when 'P7' and 'P8' were

issued. There is no material before this Court that Lokumenike succeeded to

the holding upon the death of Ukkurala. Nor has the Petitioner placed any

material to demonstrate that he, as the nominee under the permit 'R1', took

steps upon the failure of Lokumenike to succeed, or at least upon the death of

Lokumemike, to have himself substituted. Although the Petitioner states in the

letter annexed to the petition, marked 'P32', that he has been in occupation of

this land for 25 years, there is no specific averment in the petition that the

Petitioner succeeded to the land nor has the Petitioner submitted any material

to prove that he succeedea to the said land when Lokumenike failed to

succeed in terms of Section 68(1) of the Ordinance. The Petitioner being in

possession of part of the land does not amount to succeeding to the land. This

Court takes the view that succeeding to a land as contemplated by the

Ordinance requires a positive act on the part of the nominee or the person

entitled to succeed in terms of the Ordinance. The admission by the Petitioner

that five of his siblings are also in occupation of the high land and that two

others are in possession of the paddy land is clear evidence that the Petitioner

has not succeeded to the land and that even at this point of time, there are

others, in addition to the Petitioner, occupying the high land and the paddy

land. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has

failed to substantiate that he exercised his rights as a nominee and that he

succeeded to the said lands .

Section 72 of the Ordinance regulates the devolution of title when no

successor has been nominated, or the nominated successor fails to succeed, or

the nomination of a succes~or contravenes the provisions of the Ordinance.7

Section 72 of the Ordinance reads as follows:

"lf no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails

to succeed, or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions

of this Ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-

holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual

installment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the holding of an

owner shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without

leaving behind his or her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner

died leaving behind his or her spouse upon the failure of such spouse to

succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of such spouse,

devolve as prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule."

Thus, upon the failure of the nominee to succeed to the land, the State is

entitled to act in terms of Section 72 in determining devolution.

The starting point of the present dispute appears to be a letter dated 1st July

2009 written by Dharmadasa to the 1st Respondent, produced by the 6th

Respondent, marked '6RI', which is reproduced below.

There is a copy of an undated letter sent by the Grama Niladhari of

Gemunupura to the 1st Respondent on the reverse of 16Rl' which confirms that

Dharmadasa did not occupy the said lands and that six children of Ukkurala,

including the Petitioner, were in occupation of the land.

The above letter was followed by another letter dated 1ih September 2009

written by Dharmadasa to the 1st Respondent produced by the 6th Respondent,

marked '6R2'. In this letter, Dharmadasa had claimed that he had been trying

to obtain a grant for himself for the last 10-12 years but that he had

abandoned his plans as he did not receive a positive response to such request.

Dharmadasa had thereafter requested that he be named as the successor to

the said two lands. Dharmadasa had also stated in 16R2' as follows:

The request made by Dharmadasa in ,/GRi' and 'GR2', that he be permitted to

succeed to the said two grants culminated with the 1st Respondent writing the

letter marked 'P7' informing as follows8:

The name of Dharmadasa had thereafter been registered in the Register of

Grants issued under the Ordinance, a copy of which has been annexed to the

petition, marked 'pg'.

The Petitioner, being dissatisfied with the registration of Dharmadasa as the

successor of Ukkurala under ,the grants 'Pi' and 'P2' had written several letters

to the 1st - 5th Respondents. The first of these letters, which has been annexed

to the petition, marked as 'PIG' is dated 25th April 2011. By 'PiG' the Petitioner

drew the attention of the Commissioner General of Lands to the fact that the

Petitioner was the nominee. The relev~nt paragraphs of 'PiG' read as follows:

8 The identical letter has been written of the high land - vide 'pg',

9 The name mentioned in 'P7' is that of Dharmadasa.

It is in the above factual background that the Petitioner invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court, seeking the aforementioned relief. The principal

contention of the Petitioner is that he is entitled to succeed to the said lands as

he was the nominated successor under the permit. There is no dispute

between the parties that Ukkurala had nominated the Petitioner as his

successor under the permit, way back in 1962. in terms of Section 68(2) of the

Ordinance, the nominated successor must succeed to the land within a period

of 6 months. This Court has already held that the Petitioner has failed to

substantiate that he succeeded to the land upon the failure of Lokumenike to

succeed. This establishes that the Petitioner had been sleeping over his rights

for almost 20 years. The Petitioner cannot complain 20 years later that the l st _

5th Respondents have failed to give effect to the nomination made in 'Rl'. The

Petitioner must take full responsibility for his failure to act in terms of the law

and cannot place the blame on the 1st - 5th Respondents for his negligence and

laches.

It has been consistently held by our Courts that the jurisdiction of this Court

must be invoked without delay.

11

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de AlwislO Sharvananda, J (as he then was) set out the

rationale for the above proposition, in the following manner:

itA Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be

held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise

of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well accepted principles.

The Court is bound to issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by

the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled

himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like

submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver...... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury

is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay

defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

,.

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a Writ

application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay ...... An application for a Writ of Certiorari

should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which

the applicant seeks to have quashed."

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and anotherll Amerasinghe, J

adverting to the question of long delay, commented as follows:

IIlf a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the

law both to punish his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus,

11982 1 Sri LR 368; at pages 377 to 379.

111999 2 SLR 341 at 351.

12

5ubveniunt, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National H,ousing12 Bandaranayake J,

dealing with a belated applic.ation for a Writ of Certiorari, held as follows:

"It is however to be noted that delay could defeat equity. Although there

is no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limit in filing

an application for judicial review and the case law of this country is

indicative of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding 'a good

and valid reason' for allowing late applications, I am of the view that there

should be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such

belated applications. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic

characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay

in applying for the remedy".

Even if one considers the letters '6Ri' and '6R2' written in 2009 by

Dharmadasa as the starting point, the Petitioner appears to have become

agitated over Dharmadasa being recognised as the successor only in April

2011,13 and that too, because Dharmadasa was trying to sell the land. By this

time 'P7' and IpS' had been issued. This Court observes that the Petitioner has

not offered any explanation in his petition why he failed to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court, prior to 'P7' and IpS' being issued. Applying the

reasoning laid down by the Supreme Court in the aforementioned cases, this

Court takes the view that there has been undue delay on the part of the

122003 2 SLR 10 at page 15.

13 This is borne out by the letters annexed to the Petition marked 'PiG', 'P31', 'P32' and 'P33'.

13

Petitioner in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. Therefore, this Court takes

the view that on this ground, this application of the Petitioner must fail.

This Court holds that upon the failure of the Petitioner, as the nominated

successor taking steps to succeed to the lands referred to in 'PI' and 'P2', the

provisions of Section 72 of the Ordinance beco~e operative. In terms of

Section 72, the devolution of the land shall take place in accordance with Rule

1 of the Third Schedule which gives priority to the eldest son. Accordingly, the

Respondents have acted in terms of Section 72 of the Ordinance and held that

Dharmadasa is entitled to succeed. This Court reiterates that the Respondents

cannot be faulted for not giving effect to the nomination of the Petitioner

under the permit 'RI', as it was the duty of the Petitioner to have taken steps r in that regard. This Court further reiterates that the Petitioner, having slept

over his rights for almost 20 years, cannot suddenly wake up and seek an

Order of this Court to quash the events that have taken place while he was in

deep slumber. In these circumstances, the issuing of 'P7' and 'P8' cannot be

considered as illegal and therefore, this Court takes the view that 'P7' and 'P8'

are not liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. The necessity to consider

the Writ of Mandamus prayed for therefore does not arise.

This Court observes that as Dharmadasa has died, his wife is eligible to succeed

to the said lands as a life interest h~lder and the eldest son is eligible to

succeed in terms of Section 72, provided they comply with the provisions of

Section 68 of the Ordinance and succeed to the said land. However, it is

admitted that Dharmadasa's family is not resident on the high land and are not

cultivating the paddy land. In these circumstances, this Court directs the 1st -

5th Respondents to conduct an inquiry in order to determine the entitlement to

111

succeed to the lands which are the subject matter of 'P7' and IpS' and take a

decision in terms of the law. In doing so, the 1st -5th Respondents may

consider the fact that the 6th - 10th Respondents are not in possession of the

said lands, the fact that the Petitioner and five of his siblings are in occupation

of the high land and the fact that the Petitioner and two others are cultivating

the paddy lands.

This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
