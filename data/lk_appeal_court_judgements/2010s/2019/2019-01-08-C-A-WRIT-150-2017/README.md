When this application was taken up for argument on 18th June 2018, the learned

Counsel appearing for both parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment on

the written submissions that would be tendered on behalf of the parties.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the refusal by the 1st Respondent Director

General of Pensions to register the Petitioner under the Widowers and

Orphans Pension Act and to pay the pension due to him, as reflected in the

documents annexed to the petition, marked 'P19,l, 'P21,2, 'P22,3 and 'P23,4;

1 'P19' is a letter dated 18th January 2010 sent by the l't Respondent to the Zonal Director of Education, Dehiowita.

2 'P21' is a letter dated 1ih May 2010 sent by the l't Respondent to the Zonal Director of Education, Dehiowita.

2

(b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to register the Petitioner

under the Widowers and Orphans Pension Act and to pay his pension and

gratuity.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows:

The Petitioner's wife, S.L.ReginaS (Regina) was serving in the Nagasthenna Estate

School as a teacher when the said school was taken over by the Government6 on

28th June 1977. Even though Regina had continued to serve as a teacher at the

said school after it was taken over by the Government, she had not been issued

with a formal letter of appointment by the Government at the time of her death

on 18th June 19897.

After her death, the Petitioner had made representations to the Kegalle District

Education Office that the gratuity payable to Regina and the widowers pension to

which the Petitioner is entitled to, be paid to the Petitioner. The Petitioner's claim

was based on the provisions of the Widowers and Orphans Pension Act No. 24 of

1983, as amended (W&OP Act).

3 'P22' is a letter dated 11th October 2010 sent by the 1st Respondent to the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.

4 'P23' is a letter dated 19th October 2011 sent by the 1st Respondent to the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.

5 The marriage certificate of the Petitioner and Regina has been annexed to the petition, marked 'PI'. This Court observes that the name of the Petitioner is given as 'Nadesan Arumugam', which is different to the name given in the petition.

6 This is borne out by the Circular dated i h June 1977, annexed to the petition marked 'PS' issued by the Provincial Director of Education, Kegalle.

7 The death certificate of Regina has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P3'.

In terms of Section 2(1) of the W&OP Act, there shall be a pension scheme for the

payment of pension to widowers and orphans of female public officers who are

entitled to the payment of pension under the Minutes of Pension. Section 3 of the

said Act specifies that a monthly deduction shall be made from the salary of the

officer on account of the pension fund, which shall be remitted to the

Consolidated Fund. Section 9 of the Act specifies that the widowers and orphans

of officers who were subject to deductions under this Act shall be entitled to a

pension under this Act.

It appears from the several documents annexed to the petition that the Petitioner

had been pushed from 'pillar to post over the years and that even by 2007, no

finality had been reached with regard to the payment of a pension to the

Petitioner, partly due to a formal letter of appointment not having been issued to

Regina.

This issue was finally resolved when the Director of Education Sabaragamuwa

Province issued Regina a letter of appointment dated 6th November 2008,

annexed to the petition marked 'P4'. The title and the first two paragraphs of 'P4'

reads as follows:

IilmC) tM/~rsJ/f5)(S)Qfl)r.dJt5J ~~~ ~ei)@C) @m) ~ qr.~ c~ 1977.06.26 ~f5) &:>

@c.o)ci~ e>f5) cO~ QC)c ~es5f5JC) ~f5) me> ~&D ~es5e>.

Thus, there is no doubt that Regina was a Government employee at the time of

her death and that Regina was entitled to a pension. It is therefore clear that

upon the death of Regina, the Petitioner was eligible for the payment of a pension

in terms of the W&OP Act. It is however admitted by the parties that no

deductions were made from the salary of Regina on account of the pension, as

required by the W&OP Act, as she passed away long before her letter of

appointment conferring her the right to a pension was issued.

In February 2009, the Department of Pensions had issued Pension Circular No.

6/20098, permitting those who were entitled to a pension but who had not been

registered under the W&OP Act, to do so by 30th June 2009. This Circular

contained provisions relating to the registration of those who had passed away.

The following provisions of the said Circular are relevant to this application and

hence, are re-produced below:

It was therefore open to the Petitioner to have Regina registered under the

W&OP Act. The Petitioner, acting in terms of this Circular ip15', had submitted

the relevant documents required in terms thereof to the Zonal Education

Director, Dehiovita who in turn had submitted the said document to the

Department of Pensions.9

However, the Department of Pensions, by letter dated 18th January 2010 sent to

the Zonal Director of Education, annexed to the petition marked ip19' had

refused to register Regina under the Widowers and Orphan Pension Scheme for

the following reasons:

9 Vide letters dated iih June 2009 and 26th August 2009, sent by the Zonal Director of Education, Dehiowita, annexed to the petition marked 'PiT and 'P18' respectively.

This Court observes that the Department of Pensions has not given any specific

reason as to why they claim the letter of appointment was irregular.

The response of the Zonal Director of Education to 'P19' is at 'P20'1O. In this letter,

the Zonal Director has confirmed that Regina served as a teacher at the said

school from 2ih June 1977 untill her death and that according to the records

maintained at the Kegalle and Dehiovita Zonal Education Office, Regina had been

paid her salary for such period. It appears from several letters written by the

Department of Pensions thereafter that the Department of Pensions had

continued to take up the position that the letter of appointment issued to Regina

in 2008 was irregular and that no payments can be made to the Petitioner as

Regina did not hold a pensionable post at the time of her death. This Court must

10 'P20' is dated 26th April 2010.

7

observe that the delay in issuing the letter of appointment to Regina cannot be

attributed to her and that, had Regina been issued with a letter of appointment

by the Government soon after the takeover of the school, the issue before this

Court would not have arisen.

Be that as it may, the Department of Pensions by letter dated 11th October 2010

annexed to the petition marked 'p22' had sought the instructions of the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, in this regard. By

his letter dated 11th February 2011, annexed to the petition marked 'p24', the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs had responded as

follows:

Having sought and received instructions from the Ministry of Public

Administration and Home Affairs, one would have expected the Department of

Pensions to have complied with the said instructions. Unfortunately this was not

to be. It is a matter for regret that the Department of Pensions refused to follow

the said instructions given by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and

Home Affairs, as borne out by letter dated 19th October 2011, annexed to the

petition marked 'P23'. As no relief was forthcoming, the Petitioner had continued

to make representations on this matter but not having had a favourable response,

has filed this application seeking the intervention of this Court.

Taking into consideration the above factual circumstances, this Court is of the

view that the refusal by the 1st Respondent Director General of Pensions to

comply with provisions of the W&OP Act was unreasonable. Thus, when this case

was mentioned on 25th September 2018 for judgment, this Court requested the

learned State Counsel to clarify whether Regina would have been entitled to a

pension had she been issued with the letter of appointment while she was alive

and to inform this Court the reasons for the delay in issuing the letter of

appointment, inspite of a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers referred to in the

9

Statement of Objections filed on behalf of the Respondents. The learned State

Counset having obtained instructions, informed this Court on 23rd November

2018 that the Respondents are prepared to pay the Petitioner the pension that he

is entitled to in terms of the W&OP Act, together with the gratuity payable to

Regina, with effect from a date that this Court may decide, a course of action with

which the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was agreeable.

It appears to this Court that the predicament faced by the Petitioner has arisen as

a result of bureaucratic lethargy and inefficiency that has taken place at various

Government Departments, during the last 28 years. It also appears from the

letters written by the Department of Pension that its decision was influenced by a

completely irrelevant fact, which is that the pension would have to be paid from

198911

In the above circumstances, this Court proceeds to issue a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent, Director General of Pensions

contained in documents marked 'P19', 'P21' & 'P23' refusing to register Regina

under the W&OP Act and refusing to pay the Petitioner the benefits due to a

widower under the W&OP Act.

This Court issues a Writ of Mandamus on the 1st Respondent to pay the Petitioner

all sums of money that the Petitioner is entitled to under and in terms of the

W&OP Act, in accordance with the provisions of the said Act, after deducting the

llThis is borne out by the letter marked 'P23'- "~. ~. <10&) c:D~ 198906 18 ~~ <.clllCS C!~ lilG&! ~~ &:l ~~

contributions that Regina ought to have made under the said Act, with effect

from 11th February 2011 which is the date on which the Secretary, Ministry of

Public Administration and Home Affairs instructed the 1st Respondent to make the

payment. This Court is of the view that payment from the said date is reasonable,

taking into consideration all the circumstances of this case. This Court further

directs that only the period that Regina served under the Government should be

taken into consideration when calculating the period of service for purposes of

pension.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
