The appellant, Thillai Ambalan Maheswaran alias Ravi was charged

with the 2nd accused for committing the murder of one Arumugam

Elangarasa between 25th to 26th April 2012 at Pavatkulam.

At the conclusion of the trial, which had been held without a jury,

only the appellant was convicted for murder and was accordingly

sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant

invoked appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set them aside on

the basis that the trial Court had erroneously relied on the confessionary

items of evidence presented by the prosecution.

2

The prosecution case was that the deceased who was engaged in

cultivation in the Pavatkulam area went missing and it was the 2nd accused,

who was employed by the deceased as a helper, informed the family

members of his disappearance. The 2nd accused had stayed in the house at

the farm with the deceased at the time of his disappearance.

Son of the deceased had made a formal complaint to Police but no

trace of the deceased was found until someone from the village had seen a

part of a leg jutting out of the water line in an abandoned well which was

located in a jungle area but closer to the place where the deceased lived.

The Police then recovered the body of the deceased from that well.

At the time of recovery, they observed electrical wires wrapped around the

body and heavy stones were attached to it. The 2nd accused also

participated in conducting a search for the deceased and was present at the

well when the body was recovered, among other villagers.

A post mortem examination was conducted on the body of the

deceased and his death was due to electrocution.

The appellant was arrested by the Police on suspicion and upon

investigations, they recovered some electric cables tied to a sarong from a

place located about 150 meters from the well in which the body of the

deceased was found. The prosecution did not establish any relevance of

the sarong to the deceased by showing it to his family members who gave

evidence before the trial Court. Similarly no evidence was placed before

the trial Court by the prosecution in relation to the wires that had been

recovered upon information provided by the appellant to the wires that

were found along with the body of the deceased.

3

Strangely during examination in chief of SI Jayatilleke, who

conducted the investigation into this incident, the prosecution had led

evidence containing certain confessionary parts of the statement made by

the appellant in describing the circumstances under which some of the

productions that had been recovered.

The relevant section of the proceedings is reproduced below;

"Q : In that event, in which section of the statement has he

informed you so ?

A "Having removed the sarong worn by Elangarasa, it was

wrapped in metal wire and was hidden in a nook; that

place can be shown by me to Police; the wire which was

used for electrocution was rolled and hidden in two

spots; such places can be shown by me to the Police."

In its judgment, the trial Court, had stated (as per the English

translation) " ... clear evidence has revealed that the metal wires used for

committing the offence had been seized consequent to the statement of the 1st

accused." The trial Court repeats the statement once more as it states

further down in its judgment that the " .. Court is of the view that the metal

wires used to cause death to Elangarasa, the deceased in this case, were discovered

in consequent to the statement of the accused."

There is no admissible evidence before the trial Court to conclude

that the wires recovered upon the information provided by the appellant

were in fact are the ones used to electrocute the deceased. Thus, it is clear

that the trial Court, having allowed these confessionary items of evidence

4

to be led by the prosecution, had thereafter utilised the same to impute

criminal liability on the appellant.

In The Queen v Appuhamy 60 N.L.R. 313, the Court of Criminal

Appellant decided that;

"It is only when a "fact" has been discovered in

consequence of information given by an accused person

and when a witness has given evidence to that effect

that so much of such information as relates distinctly

to the fact thereby discovered may be proved."

Clearly the trial Court had erroneously admitted inadmissible

evidence against the appellant and had found the appellant guilty to

murder on the strength of that evidence. The phrase quoted above from the

judgment of the trial Court that "the metal wires used to cause death to

Elangarasa" is clearly inclusive of the confessionary part of the statement

which had been prohibited under Section 25(1) of the Evidence Ordinance

since it creates an impression in the mind of a reader that the appellant had

confessed to the killing of the deceased by electrocution. The discovery of

the wire and sarong, if properly led under Section 27 of the said Ordinance,

only establishes the fact that he had knowledge of the places where these

items were later found by the Police. That knowledge of the appellant is

clearly insufficient to impute on him any murderous intention, an element

of the offence that had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the

prosecution, in establishing a charge of murder.

5

We are inclined to agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel

for the appellant that the conviction of the appellant is erroneous and

therefore should be interfered with.

Accordingly, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on

the appellant by allowing his appeal.
