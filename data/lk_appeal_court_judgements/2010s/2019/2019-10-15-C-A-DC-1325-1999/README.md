Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the

District Court for declaration of title to the land described in the

1st schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant from a

portion of that land, which is described in the 2nd schedule to

the plaint, and damages. The defendant filed answer basically

stating that he is the tenant cultivator of the land. At the trial

the only issue raised by the defendant is (a) as the value of the

action has not been stated in the plaint and (b) as the land

described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint is not a part of the

land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint, the plaintiff

cannot maintain this action. After trial, the learned District

Judge entered Judgment for the plaintiff. Being dissatisfied with

that Judgment, the defendant has preferred this appeal.

The argument of the learned counsel for the defendant before

this Court is that the plaintiff has not proved (a) title to the

property and (b) the land described in the 2nd schedule is a part

of the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint.

As the learned counsel for the plaintiff submits, in the facts and

circumstances of this case, that argument is not entitled to

succeed.

As seen from the complaint made by the defendant to the

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, there is no issue with regard

to the identification of the disputed portion of the land and the

fact that the plaintiff is the landlord of the defendant.1 The

defendant has made that complaint against the plaintiff on the

basis that he is the tenant cultivator of the disputed paddyland

under the plaintiff. As seen from the proceedings before the

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, this complaint has later

been withdrawn because of the instant case.2 Hence the

defendant is estopped in these proceedings from contesting the

plaintiffs title to the land. (section 116 of the Evidence

Ordinance)

At the trial the plaintiff has produced documents P1-P9 to prove

his case. At the closure of the case for the plaintiff, no objection

has been taken regarding proof of those documents. Hence all

those documents become part of evidence without further ado.

The defendants evidence runs into a few lines.3 In evidence he

has stated that (a) he does not know to whom this land belongs

to, and (b) that he is not the owner of the land. The defendants

evidence in Court is fragile, contradictory and unreliable.

I see no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the District

Court. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
