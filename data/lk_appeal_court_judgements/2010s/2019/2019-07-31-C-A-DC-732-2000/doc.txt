T

he Plaintiff-Respondent instituted this action to partition a land called

"Bogahamulalanda" which was in an extent of 8 lahas paddy sowing. The Plaintiff

pleaded that the land originally belonged to one Kiri Baiya and he transferred the land to

Hatana, Kiraa and Rankiri. Kiraa died and his share devolved on Hatana and Rankiri. Both

Hatana and Rankiri became entitled to an undivided half share each of the entire corpus.

2

..

Hatana's half share went to Menika in 1921 and Menika transferred her half share to

Sirimala (Plaintiff), Sundara (lst Defendant) and Podiya (2nd Defendant) by a deed bearing

No.10692 and dated 10.07.1955. Though Sirimala derived 1/6th share of the entire land, this

share finally devolved on him, though there were other transactions on this share. Sundara

(1st Defendant) and Podiya (2nd Defendant) had 1/6th each of the entire corpus. This is how

one half share of the entire land devolved on Sirimala, Sundara and Podiya. This is the

version contained in the plaint.

Rankiri had the remaining half share of the land and he transferred it to Dayananda (3ed

Defendant) by a deed bearing No.2470 and dated 24.07.1969. Reflecting the above

devolution, the Plaintiff sought a partition of the land as follows:-

The Plaintiff 1/6 undivided

1

st Defendant 1/6 undivided

2nd Defendant 1/6 undivided rd Defendant Y2 undivided

The preliminary survey was effected by a licensed surveyor C. Kurukulasooriya and

preliminary plan bearing No.867 and dated 24.07.1980 and report attest to the fact the land

sought to be partitioned is the same as is morefuly described in the plaint.

The 6th and th Defendants filing their statements of claim claimed 1/4th the undivided

share of the land on inheritance from one Ukkumalie. They also described the land as

"Bogahamula Haw". They had no possession of the corpus and the learned District Judge of

Kegalle rightly concluded that the land that these parties claimed was another land and

there were no rights that accrued to the 6th, fh and 10th to 18th Defendants in respect of this

corpus.

The 8th and 9th Defendants intervened in the case and filing a joint statement claim

asserted that Kiri Baiya had two other brothers Punchikira and Ukkuwa and each of them

was entitled to l/3rd share of the land, including Kiri Baiya.

3

The total share of Punchikira and Ukkuwa 2/3rd was inherited by their childten named

Dingiriya and Ungiya alias Bandiya. When Ungiya passed away issueless, his share too

devolved on the childten-Aviththa (Sth Defendant), Sitti (9th Defendant) and Kalu.

So the main contest in the matter was between the Plaintiff and the Sth and 9th Defendants.

The Plaintiff traced his title to Kiri Baiya and according to his pedigree, 1st Defendant, 2nd

Defendant and 3rd Defendant inherited their respective shares from Kiri Baiya. But Sth and

9th Defendants' contention was that Kiri Baiya had two brothers Punchikira and Ukkuwa

and then Kiri Baiya would have only 113 and not the entirety of the land. In other words

the argument of the Sth and 9th Defendants was that they became co-owners of this land

through their predecessors Punchikira and Ukkuwa. If this is established, Plaintiff's

predecessor Kiri Baiya could have transferred only 1I3rd to the Sth and 9th Defendants. This

assertion was not proved at all as by way of PI-the deed bearing NO.6S63 dated 12.06.1913,

Kiri Baiya dealt with the whole of the subject-matter and transferred it to the predecessors

in title of the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant, 2nd Defendant and 3,d Defendant. W hen PI was

marked, there was no objection from the Sth and 9th Defendants and this deed was not

challenged at all.

There is no credible evidence that emerges at the trial that shows that the predecessors in

title of the Sth and 9th Defendants Punchikira and Ukkuwa also had undivided interests in

the land. If Punchikira and Ukkuwa (predecessors in title of the Sth and 9th Defendants)

and Kiribaiya (the predecessor in title of the Plaintiff, IS" 2nd and 3rd Defendants) co-owned

this property because of an original owner, and that they were brothers, this evidence

could have been given by way of Section 32-see Sinnetamby, J. in Coorey v. Wijesooriya 62

N.LR 15S. There was no such evidence in the case. The evidence that Kiri Baiya had the

entirety of the corpus and passed it to the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant, 2nd Defendant and 3rd

Defendant becomes more probable in view of the fact that the relationship among the

brothers (predecessors in title of the Sth and 9th Defendants) was not satisfactorily

established at the trial as such and I cannot fault the learned District Judge for taking the

view that the pedigree of the Sth and 9th Defendants was not proved at the trial.

4

..

PI makes it clear that the original owner of the corpus was Kiri Baiya and he had inherited

the land from his father Undiya. No doubt PI deals with other lands that are co-owned but

as for the corpus the deed is quite emphatic-it speaks of sole ownership to the corpus. It is

this sole ownership that Kiri Baiya passed to the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff, 1st,

2nd and 3'd Defendants.

Upon a perusal of the deed PI, it is clear that the parties had divided their properties and

Kiri Baiya had transferred what he had got to the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff, 1st,

2nd and 3rd Defendants. Even the 8th and 9th Defendants admitted that the possession of the

Plaintiff, 1st

, 2nd and 3rd Defendants was more than 60 years. There was indeed evidence of

sharing the money out of the proceeds of sale of cut timber trees on the land among the

parties but it was in any event an isolated payment, and if at all, it took place in 1970. It

could not have affected a 60 year old prescriptive possession.

Upon a conspectus of the evidence led in the case, I take the view that the judgment dated

22.08.2000 is flawless and cannot be impugned. So I affirm the judgment and dismiss the

appeal.
