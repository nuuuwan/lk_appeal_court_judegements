By a petition dated 4th September 2019, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants-

Respondents-Petitioners (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendants")

have sought the rec tifica~ion of the judgement deliver ,~d by this Court in this

ca~e on 04.09.2018, by seeking to have a part of the said judgement set aside.

The material part of the judgement which contains the impugned portion sought

to be rectified reads as follows:

"Accordingly, 1 take the view that the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that P2 the

deed ofcancdlation is null and void and in the drcumstances P3, the deed of

transfer and P4 the deed of gift donating a portion of the subject

matter on the ~tl ength of the title purportedly acquired by the 1" , Defendant by W ;lY of P2 should also be decbred nuD and void. n -see

There is no complaint of a per incuriam order that is madr against the 1" sentence

of the above paragraph (unhighlighted portion) and it is only in regard to the

highlighted part of the judgment the Defendants seek to attach the taint of a "per

incuriam decision or determination" and though the Defendants did not prefer an

appeal to the Supreme Court canvassing the propriety of the judgment, the

jurisdiction of this Court is invoked to correct or rectify the decision in the

highlighted portion on the premise that it is per incuriam and that this Court can

rectify it on the basis of its inherent jurisdiction.

If one summarizes the effect of the above ratio in the paragraph, it would mean

that this Court in its judgment dated 04.09.2018 had declared null and void a

unilateral cancellation oj .a deed of gift (P2). In addition this Court made further -declarations that two other deeds P3 and P4 which w,~ e executed and derived

their purported validity subsequent to P2 were also null and void. The argument

is that this Court lacked jurisdiction to make these two further declarations.

These are declarations rr ade per incuriam and should therefore be rectified in the

inherent jurisdiction of this Court. This was the argument that was advanced by

the Petitioners and according to Mr. Champaka Ladduwahetty the learned

Counsel for the Petition~5 this argument springs from Section 839 of the Civil , Procedure Code (CPe) which reads as follows:

"Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent

power of the Court I ) make such orders as may be necessary for the wds ofjustice or to

prevent abuse of the process of the Court."

The petition before this Court undoubtedly engages the question whether the

main decision was rcactred per incuriam and I recall Lord Alfred Tennyson's

memorable lines in Aylnl':'s Field:

"Mastering the lawless sciCllce of our law,

That codeless myric.d of precedent,

4

l

j(

Website Copy Website Copy

That wilderness of single instances,

Through which a few, by wit or fortul1e led,

May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame."

Per Incuriam orders rectifiable in inherent jurisdiction

From among the labyrinthine maze of precedents I do stumble upon authorities

for the proposition that -.:ven per incuriam orders are :::apaJ lie of rectification in the

exercise of inherent power. The rationale behind this approach is the all too

familiar principle that no man shall be put in jcopardy by a mistake made by a

Court. The Court should be amenable to the exercise of inherent powers to

rectify errors made per il1curiam-see Kariawasam v Priyadhrashani (2004) 1

Sri.LR 189. Where orders are demonstrably and marufestly wrong and where it

i1 is necessary in the interests of justice to correct such errors, even the Supreme

, , Court has declared that it has inherent power to correct its errors. Decisions

made per incuriam can thus be corrected. The Supreme Court has proceeded on

the basis that inherent [lowers are adjuncts to existing jurisdiction to remedy

injustice. They are certainly not the source of new jurisdictions to revise a

judgment rendered by that Court-see AU Ceylon Commercial &' Industrial

Workers Union v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Another (1995) 2

Sri.LR 295 at 297. In Gaheshananthan v Vivienne Gunawardene and Three

Others (1984) I Sri.LR 319, the Court held:

"As a Superior Couvt of record there is no doubt that it has inherent powers to make

corrections to meet the ends of justice".

InJeyaraJ FernandopiUai v De Silva and Others (1996) 1 Sri.LR 70, a five judge

decision of the Supremet Court, which remains a locus classicus on inherent

jurisdiction, Amerasingha J held that where the judges are available, a review of

the per incuriam decision should be referred to the COUrl composed of the judges

who heard the case. Amerasinghe J alluded to Wickrelnasinghe and Others v

Cornel Perera and Others S.c. Minutes of 21.03.1996, S.C.L.A No 49/96 and

r

stated that the Court has advanced beyond graceful politeness and considerateness in

intercourse as a justification of the practice.

In order to ascertain whether the further declarations of invalidity made in this

case attract the per incuriam rule, the factual template of the case has to be laid

bare before one proceed& to dispose of this argument apd in a nutshell, the facts

engulfed in the case go as follows:

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Plaintiff) had instituted this action in the District Court of Kurunegala seeking

among other reliefs that the deed of cancellation or revpcation (Pl) effected by

his mother be set aside. She had gifted the subject-mattl"r of the action by a deed

,Ii of gift (PI) in his favour on 16.09.1986 but four years later her maternal instincts

veered towards her younger son and so she unilaterally proceeded to revoke the

deed of gift by a deed of revocation or cancellation on 27.03.1983 (Pl).

In the wake of this revocation she transferred the land to the younger son -the 1st

Defendant on 27.04.1983 (P3). Subsequent to this acquisition the 1st Defendant

(the younger son) donated the land to his son-in-law -the 2nd Defendant by P4.

.1 The Plaintiff sought a declaration that he remained the legal owner of the , property despite the uniiateral revocation of the deed of gift on the part of his

mother. The Plaintiff averred that that since PI (the deed of gift) remained valid

and effectual, the subsequent deeds Pl (deed of revocation ofthe deed of gift),

P3 (the deed of transfer) and P4 (the deed of gift) aU became null and void.

When the matter was taken up for trial on 07.03.2000, the Plaintiff raised the

.t following issues:

I) Is the deed of gift (PI) irrevocable?

2) Are the executiOn<; of Pl, P3 and P4 illegal and nuU and void since PI (the

deed of gift) remained irrevocable?

6

,.

Website Copy Website Copy

t

The Defendants raised L;sues No 4, 5, 6 and 7 and the m<lterial issues were to this

effect:

3) Is the deed of gift in favour of the Plaintiff invalid according to Muslim

Law?

4) Did the initial don' l-the mother-re-arquire her title to the property after

she had revoked tile deed of gift (PI) on the b lSis that it was invalid

according to Mud im Law?

5) Did the Defendants acquire title on P3 aDd P4?

The learned District Judg'~ of Kurul1cgala treated the above issues as issues of law

and afforded an opporturcity to the parties to tender written submissions.

By a judgment dated I9t\~eptembe r 2000, the learned District Judge held with

the Defendants declaring the deed of gift in favour of the Plaintiff (PI) invalid

according to Muslim b .w and dismissed the case of th ~ Plaintiff. It was against

this judgment that the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent had preferred an appeal

to this Court and this Court, after having heard both counsel for the parties,

reversed the judgment of the District Court on 04.09.2018 and after having made

the above observation wr.ich I have quoted in the anterior part of this judgment, , I proceeded to hold that 'the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for in his

amended plaint and alli)wed the appeal.

In fact the amended plaint dated 10th February 1999, sought il1ter alia the following

relief:

(a) The Plaintiff should be declared the absolute owner of the property by

virtue of PI-the,deed of gift executed by the mother.

(b) A declaration t!hlt P2 (the deed of revocation of the deed of gift), P3

(the deed of traasfer in favour of the 1st Defendant) and P4 (the deed of

gift in favour of the 2nd Defendant) are all invalid and that the 1st and 2nd

Defendants do not derive any interest or title to the land.

..

These two remedies constituted the fulcrum of the legal issues tried by the

learned District Judge and this Court allowed these remedies as prayed for in the

amended plaint after an exhaustive analysis of the facts ,md the law.

The gist of the ratio of the judgment dated 04.09.2018 would be clistilled as

follows: Sections 3 and 4 of the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance make

two things as plain as a pikestaff. As Muslim Law stipulates delivery and

possession of the gift as prerequisites to the constitution of a valid gift, Section

3 would govern such a gift. By virtue of section 4 a Muslim donor can make a gift

under the common law and in this latter case which would be governed by

Roman Dutch Law, the donor could reserve or impose a conclition such as a

usufruct or life interest -~~e Haseena Umma v jemaJdeen 68 N.L.R 300; A}jya

Marikar Abuthahir v 'Aliyar Marikar Mohammed Sally 43 N.L.R. 193 ;

Weerasekera v Pieris ~4 N.L.R 281 (PC). In fact Ahya MarikaI's case which

had the composition of '5 judges of the Supreme Court overruled the previous

decision of Sultan v Peris 35 N.L.R 57 and followed the PC decision of

Weerasekera (supra).

In the case before this Court the donor had gifted the corpus to the Plaintiff by

PI subject to her life interest and irrevocable. As such thlS Court held that Roman

Dutch Law would govern the revocation of the deed of gift namely PI and

necessarily the donor should have sought the assistance of Court to have this

deed of gift revoked; instead she chose to cancel the deed by P2 of her own accord

and such a unilateral revocation is impermissible in Roman Dutch Law-for a

survey of the law pertaining to revocation of deeds of gift - see Franklin

Fernando v Anacletus r 'd:rnando and Others (2015) I Sri.LR 1 (CA).

Since P2 was not valid :md effectual so as to revoke PI, this court made the

further declarations that the subsequent deeds after P2, namely P3 (the deed of

transfer in favour of the younger son) and P4 (the deed of donation by the

younger son) were both invalid and infructuous. This is the conclusion that

8

'(

Website Copy Website Copy

naturally follows as axiomatic or as the crow flies upon this Court's finding that

PI was never revoked and P3 and P4 which followed the inoperative deed of

revocation (P2) have to be necessarily null and void and inoperative per se.

The inv:tlidity of P3 and P4 is a corollary which is irresistible upon the

supposition that P2 (the deed of revocation) is a nullity as no Court authorized

the revocation. One cannot put something on nothi 19 as Lord Denning so

famously echoed the catchy expression in the Privy Council in McFoy v United

Africa Company(1961) 3 AER 1169 at 1172.

As I said before, the Plaintiff had inter alia prayed for in his plaint:

cI (a)A Declaration of tide in respect of the land described in the schedule to

plaint based on the deed of gift (PI)

(b) A Declaration I hat deeds P2, P3 and P4 are null and void and no title

to the land passed to the 1st and 2nd Defendants:

The trial judge himself fOllnd the issues raised on the pleadings as legal issues and

l ordered that written sllbmissions be tendered. It wa<; based on the written

submissions that he haq, delivered his judgment dismissing the plaint of the

Plaintiff.

This Court having found P2 (deed of revocation) null and void proceeded to

make the declarations that P3 and P4 too were invalid. This entailed the effect

of granting the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff and it is worth recalling that

there was no appeal thilt was preferred to the Supreme Court against the

judgment of this Courr qlated 04.09.2018. But one year later on 4th September

2019, this petition has been preferred by the fJr.fendants-Respondents-

Petitioners on the basis that that the declaraLic)D that (he subsequent deeds P3

(the deed of transfer in Favour of the 1st Defendant) and P4 (the deed of gift in

favour of the 2nd Defendant) could be made only after adduction of evidence in

'1 9

Website Copy Website Copy

the District Court and th ~rcfore the case should have been sent back for further

trial.

As the Latin tag quite aptly describes it, it is reductio ad absurdum or carrying an

argument to an inconsistent absurdity to insist on a trial to ascertain the validity

or otherwise of P3 and P4. Since P2-the antecedent eked of revocation that is

alleged to have breathed jife into P3 and P4 is itself infructuous and invdlid, it is

patently obvious that P3,nnd P4 do not exist in law and no title to the land in

question could have inured to the benefit of the 1" and 2nd Defendants. Whether

P3 and P4 are valid and dfectual in view of the fact that P2 has been found to be

invalid and ineffectual is a question that does not need the motions of a trial to

resolve. It is for this reason that pure questions of law under section 147 of the

Civil Procedure Code have been delineated as issues which would dispose of a

case without the necessit'~ to adduce any evidence-see Muthukrishna v Gomes

(1994) (3) Sri.LR 01.

The issues that were tried by the learned DistrictJudge, albeit by way of written

submissions, were indisputably pure questions of law that are capable of

disposing of the case without adducring of any evidence and that decision to

assign issues as pure questions of law was rightly made. This Court only reversed

the answers to the i ssue~) given by the learned District Judge and it is my view

that no per incuriam taint !mpugns the answers given by this Court.

No per incuriam order

So I hold the view that rhis Court did not make a per incuriam order inasmuch as

P2 was null and void and ipso facto P3 and P4 becaml: inoperative or lifeless,

figuratively speaking. The judgment of this court dated 04.09.2018 in the case

falls far outside the pale of per incuriam decisions.

other grounds, wc cannot regard this as such a case.

Rupert Cross and Harris in their seminal \\ ork on r :ccedellt ill Ellglish Law (4tiJ

Edition, 1990, p149) acknowledge the above passage 'IS probably the leading

statement of the principle of per incuria/11.

So in the petition before me which has raised the per incuriam contention, no

statutory rule has been cited to have been overlooked nor did counsel point out

that this Court has turned a Nelsonian eye to a precedent which is binding on

this Court. Neither does the complaint of the Defendants fall within the cocktail

of grounds that Halsbury enumerates as set out above. ,

The further declarations that this Court made in the case namely P3 and P4 could

not have validly operated to confer title on the 1" and 2nd Defendants- came about

as answers to the legal iS1;ues in the casc and those declarations were made after

It a full consideration of tht facts and the law immanent ill the case.

Thus I would dispose of the argument by holding that the conclusions reached

in the judgment as to the invalidity of P3 and P4 are not per incuriam and I would

now turn to the 2nd argument on behalf of the Defendants that the judgment has

to be varied in view of section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 189 argument "

t I reiterate that the declarations made in this case were decisions deliberately

reached after a careful consideration and Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code

that has been invoked additionally does not embracc wlthin it a decision which

13

Website Copy Website Copy

,

was made rightly or wrongly after a full consideration of the facts in the case. As

section 189 of the CPC clearly shows, it is a clerical or arithmetical mistake in

judgments, decrees or orders or errors arising therein from any accidental slip or

omission that may at any time be corrected by the court either of its own motion

or on the application of any of the parties.

Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code reads:

(l)The Court may at any time, either on its own motion or on that of any party,

correct any clerical or, arithmetical mistake in any judgment or order, or any

' l error arising therein ~rom any accidental slip or omission, or may make any , amendment which is necessary to bring a decree into conformity with the

judgment.

(2) Reasonable notice of any proposed amendment under this section shall in all

cases be given to partics or their registered attorneys.

There cannot be an accic:\lrntal slip or omission when a judgment is deliberately

reached after a full consideration of the facts and the law. In such a situation it is

the Supreme Court which has to review and appraise the judgment in its

appellate juriscliction. No accidental slip or omission through inadvertence has

crept into the judgment.

SinnoAppu vs. Andriset alB N.L.R 297the Supreme Court held that if a court

is satisfied that there is a clerical error in its decree, it is bound to eorrect it, and ,e the fact that there is tht; same clerical error in the judgment upon which the

decree is founded cannot make any difference even though the result is that the

decree as amended is at variance with the judgment. If the judgment contains a

mistake in addition, wllich mistake is repeated in the decree, or if it contains a

clerical error whieh is repeated in the decree, the decret: ought to be amended

A careful reading of section 189 makes it crystal ckar that there is a clear

c distinction between an e.Toneous decision and an erfCIr apparent on the face of

14

Website Copy Website Copy

the record. The first can be corrected by the higher forum, the latter can only be

corrected by exercise of an inherent jurisdiction. Thus a review petition invoking

the inherent jurisclictiol1 .)f this Court and Section 189 power, as it is before me,

has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be 'an appeal in disguise'.

So both arguments namely per incuriam rule and section 189 of the Civil Procedure

Code fail and in the cire nnstances I would disallow the petition and clisrniss it.
