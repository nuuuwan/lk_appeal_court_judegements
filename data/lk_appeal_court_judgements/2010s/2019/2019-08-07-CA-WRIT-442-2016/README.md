Decided on: 05.08.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner (Agro Consolidated Private Limited) filed this

application on 27.12.2016 against the Consumer Affairs

Authority and the 13th Respondent Consumer (A.W.

Karunasena) seeking to set aside the decision of the Consumer

Affairs Authority reflected in P8 and P9 whereby the Petitioner

was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 2,400,000/=, a part of the

purchase price of the Paddy Harvesting Machine, to the

consumer.

According to P8, the consumer has bought the machine from the

Petitioner for a sum of Rs. 4,800,000/=, a very significant

amount to any consumer. The consumer says that the machine

did not function properly from the very inception.

According to P7, the date of purchase of the machine is not

clear. The consumer says that it was in August 2008, but on

behalf of the Petitioner, as seen from pages 3 and 4 of P7, it has

been suggested that the machine has been purchased in

September 2007. The Consumer Affairs Authority in the

decision marked P9 has not made a finding on this vital matter.

3

There are four similar cases filed by the Petitioner where facts

are different. The date of purchase of the machine, the reliefs

granted by the Consumer Affairs Authority after the inquiry, the

date of filing the action etc. are all different. They are

CA/WRIT/446/2015 filed on 12.11.2015, CA/WRIT/236/2016

filed on 25.07.2016, CA/WRIT/55/2017 filed on 21.02.2017 and

CA/WRIT/22/2017 filed on 23.01.2017. Hence Judgment will

be delivered in each case separately having made use of the

material tendered particularly in CA/WRIT/446/2015 and in

CA/WRIT/236/2016.

The State has filed objections on behalf of the Consumer Affairs

Authority only in CA/WRIT/446/2015. Insofar as the five

consumers are concerned, objections have been filed only the

consumer in CA/WRIT/236/2016.

Written submission on behalf of the Petitioner has been filed in

CA/WRIT/446/2015 covering all five cases. Out of the

consumers, only the consumer in CA/WRIT/236/2016 has filed

written submission. It is significant to note that no written

submission has been filed on behalf of the Consumer Affairs

Authority.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has taken up

several positions to convince this Court that the decision of the

Consumer Affairs Authority is unsustainable.

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that

the complaint of the consumer was prescribed when he

complained to the Consumer Affairs Authority.

Section 13(1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 9 of

2003, reads as follows:

4

The Authority may inquire into complaints regarding

a) the production, manufacture, supply, storage,

transportation or sale of any goods and to the supply

of any services which does not conform to the

standards and specifications determined under

section 12; and

b) the manufacture or sale of any goods which does not

conform to the warranty or guarantee given by

implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer or

trader.

Section 13(2) is the one which is directly relevant to the issue at

hand. It reads as follows:

A complaint under subsection (1) which relates to the sale

of any goods or to the provision of any service shall be

made to the Authority in writing within three months of the

sale of such goods or the provisions of such service, as the

case may be.

There is no dispute that there was a warranty period of six

months given to the machine from the date of purchase. Hence

as held in Acua Technologies (Pvt) Ltd v. Consumer Affairs

Authority [2012] 1 Sri LR 358 the consumer could, without

offending section 13(2) of the Act, complain to the Consumer

Affairs Authority during the warranty period notwithstanding it

exceeded more than three months. It was held in that case that

the time limit of three months stipulated in section 13(2) of the

said Act will not apply to a complaint made under section

13(1)(b).

5

Accordingly, the general rule is that the consumer shall

complain to the Consumer Affairs Authority within three months

from the date of purchase of the good or service provided.

Nevertheless, if there is a warranty or guarantee to the good sold

or service provided, the consumer can complain to the

Consumer Affairs Authority during the course of the warranty or

guarantee, despite such period extends more than three months.

The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that the

consumer in this case complained to the Consumer Affairs

Authority several years after the date of the purchase of the

machine and several years after the expiration of the warranty

period.

In terms of section 13(2) of the Act, the complaint shall be in

writing. The crucial document is P6, which is the written

complaint of the consumer to the Consumer Affairs Authority.

This is a joint complaint by the five consumers. The impugned

decision of the Consumer Affairs Authority was taken on this

complaint. According to the date stamp of the Consumer Affairs

Authority, the Authority has received it on 25.06.2012.

However, P6 is dated 29.09.2008.

If the written complaint was in fact received by the Consumer

Affairs Authority on 25.06.2012, there is no dispute that the

complaint is clearly prescribed. If it has been received on

29.09.2008, and if the machine has been purchased in August

2018, the complaint is not prescribed. But if it has been

purchased in September 2007, the complaint is prescribed

because it is beyond the warranty period. Hence the failure to

make a finding on the date of purchase of the machine in the

impugned decision is fatal to reach a correct conclusion by the

6

Authority. I will for the time being assume that the consumer

purchased the machine in August 2008.

The position of the consumer is that the said complaint was

handed over to the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs

Authority at Hambantota on or around 29.09.2008, but no

action was taken.

It appears from 10R2 tendered with the statement of objections

of the consumer in CA/WRIT/236/2016 that the consumers

handed over a written complaint dated 11.05.2012 to the

Consumer Affairs Authority on this matter, and in that written

complaint, it has been mentioned about a previous complaint

made to the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority at

Hambantota on the same subject, which, according to the

consumers, was under investigation. Therefore, by 10R2, the

Consumer Affairs Authority has informed the Regional Office at

Hambantota to update the Consumer Affairs Authority without

delay the action taken in regard to the former complaint on the

same matter.

I must pause for a while to state that neither the consumer nor

the Consumer Affairs Authority tendered a copy of the said

complaint dated 11.05.2012 mentioned in 10R2 and/or the

written reply received by the Consumer Affairs Authority from

the Regional Office in response to 10R2.

It appears from 10R3 tendered by the consumer in

CA/WRIT/236/2016 with his statement of objectionsa letter

sent by the Consumer Affairs Authority to the consumer asking

him to attend for a meeting on 15.08.2012and P3a letter sent

by the Consumer Affairs Authority to the Petitioner asking the

7

same thingthat the File relevant to this complaint has been

sent by the Regional Office at Hambantota to the Consumer

Affairs Authority.

It appears that P6 complaint was in that File. This is only an

assumption.

According to paragraph 2 from the bottom of page 2 of the order

of the Consumer Affairs Authority marked P9, the Consumer

Affairs Authority has received the complaint from the Regional

Office on 28.05.2012.

If it was received on 28.05.2012, it is unclear why the Consumer

Affairs Authority placed the date stamps of 25.06.2012 and

26.06.2012 on the complaint P6. Then the date stamp should

have been placed on 28.05.2012.

If the complaint was received by the Consumer Affairs Authority

on 28.05.2012, the Consumer Affairs Authority and its Members

in paragraph 19 of its statement of objections filed in

CA/WRIT/446/2015 and the Chairman of it in paragraph 21 of

the corresponding affidavit stated a falsehood that the

Consumer Affairs Authority received the documents from the

Regional Office on 25.06.2012 and transferred them to the

Consumer Complaints Unit on 26.06.2012 for necessary action.

It appears that the Consumer Affairs Authority has not

performed their statutory duties responsibly on this complaint.

As seen from inquiry notes marked P10(a), P10(d), P10(e), pages

7-8 of P7(a), this vital matterwhen the written complaint was

made to the Consumer Affairs Authorityhas been specifically

raised on behalf of the Petitioner at the inquiry but no evidence

8

has been produced to convince that P6 complaint was handed

over to the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority at

Hambantota on or around 29.09.2008.

In reply, the Consumer Affairs Authority in its statement of

objections filed in CA/WRIT/446/2015, in paragraph 17, and its

Chairman in paragraph 19 of the corresponding affidavit state

that, There was no necessity for the 1st Respondent (Consumer

Affairs Authority) to initiate any inquiry to ascertain the actual

date of the complaint as it is already printed on the complaint

itself. That I must say is a very irresponsible statementa

statement which cannot sustain in the eyes of law even for a

moment. What matters is not the date which appears on the

written complaint, but the date on which the written complaint

was lodged with the Consumer Affairs Authority.

The learned counsel for the consumer in CA/WRIT/236/2016,

with the permission of Court, filed a copy of a letter dated

07.06.2011 marked 10R7(a), written by the consumer in

CA/WRIT/446/2015 to the Regional Office of the Consumer

Affairs Authority at Hambantota. In that letter the consumer

has stated the fact of handing over the complaint dated

29.09.2008 to the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs

Authority at Hambantota. It may be recalled that P8 complaint

is dated 29.09.2008. Nevertheless, in 10R7(a) it is not stated

when that complaint dated 29.09.2008 was handed over to the

Regional Office. The original registered Postal Article Receipt

has also been tendered marked 10R7(b) to prove the posting of

that letter on 07.06.2011. Hence, upon this letter, this Court

cannot come to the conclusion that P8 complaint was received

9

by the Regional Office of the Consumer Affairs Authority at

Hambantota on 29.09.2008.

If that complaint marked P6 was received by the Regional Office

of the Consumer Affairs Authority at Hambantota on or around

29.09.2008 that could have been easily established by

producing some document or affidavit under the hand of an

officer in the Consumer Affairs Authority of the Hambantota

Regional Office. This has not been done. It is not clear whether

the Consumer Affairs Authority did not do so deliberately as it

was unfavourable to the consumer or the Consumer Affairs

Authority acted irresponsibly.

Although this Court is quite sensible to the fact that the

consumer is a weaker party and has no control over the affairs

of the Consumer Affairs Authority, Court cannot help the

consumer upon assumed facts. Court has to decide the matter

on the material presented before it.

Hence on the available evidence I am compelled to conclude that

the complaint of the consumer was prescribed when it was made

to the Consumer Affairs Authority. There is no evidence to the

satisfaction of the Authority or Court that the consumer lodged

the written complaint within three months from the date of the

purchase of the machine or during the course of its warranty,

which extended up to six months from the date of the purchase.

In this view of the matter, there is no necessity to deal with the

other arguments taken up by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner.

The decision of the Consumer Affairs Authority contained in

P8(a), P8 and P9 is quashed by way of writ of certiorari.

10

Application is allowed. No costs.
