Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Hijaaz Hizbulla for the Petitioner.

the Respondents.

Decided on: 18.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application against the Commissioner of

Labour (respondent) seeking to quash by way of a writ of

certiorari the certificate filed in the Magistrates Court under

section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund, No.15 of 1958,

as amended, marked X2, predominantly on the basis that,

although the certificate referred to 1890 employees, the

particulars of the said employees were not set out in the said

certificate so as to facilitate the petitioner company to show

cause.

The respondent filed objections to this application stating inter

alia that particulars running into large number of pages were

filed in the Magistrates Court separately, together with the

certificate, and produced them marked 3R5C and 3R5D.

The petitioner admits receipt of the Final Notice marked 3R4

sent by the respondent to the petitioner before filing the

certificate marked X1 in Court. The petitioner has not

responded to it. In the circumstances, the respondent had no

option, but to file the certificate X1 in the Magistrates Court.

When X1 was filed, the Magistrates Court issued notice on the

petitioner to show cause. As seen from the proceedings of the

Magistrates Court, the petitioner has responded to it, and the

parties had been exploring the possibility of a settlement of the

matter.

The documents marked 3R6 and 3R6(a) filed by the respondent

with the objections contain this settlement where the petitioner

has shown some payments made as EPF contributions, which

are not reflected in the certificate X1.

3

It is thereafter the amended certificate X2 has been filed by

deducting the said payments.

The respondent cannot be found fault with filing the amended

certificate with leave of Court and without objection from the

petitioner, because the petitioner did not produce those payment

receipts to the respondent when the Final Notice 3R4 was sent

prior to the filing of the certificate X1.

The petitioner in the counter affidavit states that the surcharge

in X2 cannot remain the same, when amount of contribution is

changed. These are factual matters, of which there is no

agreement between the parties. Writ does not lie when facts are

in dispute.

In the two cases cited by the counsel for the petitioner, i.e., City

Carriers v. Attorney General [1992] 2 Sri LR 257 and Mohomed

Ameer v. Yapa, Assistant Commissioner of Labour [1998] 1 Sri LR

156, no particulars had been provided in the certificates, and

therefore distinguishable.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner. No costs.
