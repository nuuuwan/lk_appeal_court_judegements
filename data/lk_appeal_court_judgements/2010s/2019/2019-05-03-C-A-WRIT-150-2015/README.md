Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Uditha Egalahewa, P.C., with Ranga

Dayananda for the Petitioner.

S. Balapatabendi, Senior D.S.G., for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 02.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application against the four respondents

seeking:

a) To issue a writ of mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd

respondents to submit the necessary documents to the 4th

respondent enabling the petitioner to obtain his due

pension; and

b) To issue a writ of mandamus directing one or more or all

of respondents to take necessary steps to pay his pension

in terms of Pension Minutes and the relevant Circulars

issued by the State.

I must say at the outset that the reliefs prayed for by the

petitioner are vague, and on that ground alone, the application

of the petitioner is liable to be dismissed.

It is well settled law that mandamus lies to compel a statutory

duty, which the petitioner has a legal right to demand. In order

for the Court to consider the alleged statutory duty, the

petitioner shall in unambiguous terms inform the Court what

the said statutory duty is, which the respondent has failed to

perform.

It is quite clear from the documents marked 2RA-2RE tendered

with the statement of objections of the 2nd respondent that the

2nd respondent being the Chief Administrative Officer of the 1st

respondent Pradeshiya Sabha has sent with great enthusiasm

all the required documents to the 4th respondent to see that the

petitioner is paid the pension. It is very unfair on the part of the

petitioner to make allegations even obliquely against the 1st and

2nd respondents as they have been all out to help the petitioner

to secure the pension, and even explanations have been called

from the 2nd respondent by the 3rd respondent in unfairly

helping the petitioner in this regard-vide 3R5. In that backdrop,

the petitioner shall specify any other necessary documents

which he thinks the 2nd respondent has withheld preventing the

4th respondent from giving him the pension. The first relief is

not only vague, but also baseless.

Secondly, the petitioner wants Court to compel by mandamus

one or more or all of the respondents to take necessary steps to

pay his pension in terms of Pension Minutes and the relevant

Circulars issued by the State.

Here again he wants the respondents to take necessary steps to

pay his pension. He is not certain who can pay his pension.

According to him, the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha or its

Secretary or Commissioner of Local Government can pay his

pension! In my view, the petitioner has not filed this application

with seriousness. He must understand that writ is a

discretionary remedy, and the conduct of the petitioner is

intensely relevant in deciding the matter.

The petitioners services for book binding have been taken by the

Pradeshiya Sabha on piece rate basis for the first time from

4

01.08.1998 when he was nearly 45 years of age44 years and 9

months to be exact-vide P1A and P1B. The period during which

he worked on piece rate basis he has been paid Rs.15/=

allowance per book-vide P1A. This period cannot be added to

the pensionable service-vide 2RC.

Thereafter, at the age of 48, he has been appointed as a casual

peon in the library from 28.12.2001 on daily pay basis-vide P2.

Then he has been appointed to the permanent post of book-

binder effective from 01.07.2005 by the appointment letter

marked P4. It has been stated in P4 that the said appointment

is pensionable. He has thereafter retired from service on

23.10.2013 at the age of 60-vide P7.

The petitioner in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the petition states as

follows:

11. The 4th respondent requested the 1st and/or 2nd

respondent to submit additional information in respect of

recruitment of the petitioner who was over 45 years of age

when he was recruited. The petitioner states that the said

recruitment of the petitioner was not in violation of PA

Circular 23/94 as there was a decision by the 1st

respondent. A copy of the letter dated 31st October 2013 is

annexed hereto marked P7A and plead part and parcel

hereof.

12. The petitioner states that the 1st and/or 2nd

respondents have failed and/or neglected to send the

additional information requested by the 4th respondent and

thus, the petitioner is denied of his due pension rights.

5

P7A is a letter sent by the 4th respondent to the 2nd respondent

asking the latter to send the Cabinet Decision allowing the

petitioner who was recruited to the government service after 45

years of age to pay the pension.

Public Administration Circular 23/94 referred to in paragraph

11 of the petition says that the maximum age for recruitment to

the Government Service is 45 years-vide 3R3.

P7A reads as follows:

2013.10.22

.

02.

.45 . 23/94

. 45 .

03.

... 23/94

.

04. /

.

In response to this letter the 2nd respondent (with a copy of that

letter) has written to the 3rd respondent seeking

recommendation and approval to inform the 4th respondent in

order to facilitate the payment of pension to the petitioner.

This has been replied by the 3rd respondent by 2RB in the

following manner:

6

2013.11.15

.

02. . 45

52

///4/0 2012.03.15

..

.

03. // 55-2013

2013.10.31 ... 23/94

.

Then it is clear that neither a cabinet approval nor a policy

decision has been taken to pay pension for those who have been

recruited to the Government Service beyond the age of 45 years.

Merely because the appointment letter P4 states that the

appointment is pensionable, unless the petitioner satisfies the

other requirements stipulated by the Pension Minutes and the

Circulars, he cannot demand pension on the ground that the

appointment, in accordance with the appointment letter, is

pensionable. One such requirement is ten-year service.

Another is recruitment to the government service before 45 years

of age. There may be other requirements. The petitioner has at

least failed to satisfy the second requirement mentioned above.

I might add that even if the petitioner has fulfilled all the

requirements, still, A public servant has no absolute right or

legal right to a pension enforceable by Mandamus. (Wilson v.
