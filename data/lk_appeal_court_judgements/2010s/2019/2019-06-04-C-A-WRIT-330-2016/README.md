Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The subject matter of this application is of grave national

importance. It involves construction of a 220 Kilovolt Electricity

Transmission Line traversing from Polpitiya Grid Substation at

Laxapana Generating Complex to Pannipitiya Grid Substation in

the Western Province. The case of the petitioner in short is

drawing the Transmission Line over her premises is illegal and

arbitrary. The petitioner seeks the following reliefs from Court:

(a) To quash by writ of certiorari the decision of the 1st

respondent Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) marked

P4(a) and (b) to have wayleave over the land of the

petitioner for the aforementioned purpose;

(b) To prohibit the CEB by writ of prohibition to implement

the said decision;

(c) To compel the CEB by writ of mandamus to draw the

said Transmission Line through the route depicted in

plan marked P5(a) or any other route avoiding the

petitioners premises;

(d) To compel the 9th respondent Central Environmental

Authority by writ of mandamus to carry out another

environmental impact assessment in addition to the

initial environmental examination report already

approved.

According to the initial map prepared by the CEB and marked

P5(a), the said Transmission Line does not run over the

petitioners premises. However the revised map marked P5(b)

3

diverted the above route and runs over the petitioners premises.

It is the complaint of the petitioner that this deviation from the

original position is unreasonable and irrational and was done for

collateral purposes. The petitioner stresses that the route

suggested in P5(a) in fact avoids residential areas and

predominantly traversing paddy and bare lands, and further

says that the ill effects of environmental and socio-economic

impact caused by the latter suggestion by P5(b) is greater. I

must stress that it is on this basis alone the petitioner presented

the case in her petition.

The 1st respondent CEB, the 4th respondent Divisional Secretary

and the 9th respondent National Environmental Authority in

their objections given extensive explanations with supporting

documents why plan P5(b) was decided to be acted upon. These

reasons are rejected by the petitioner.

This Court in the exercise of writ jurisdiction cannot decide on

administrative or judicial decisions of which facts involved are in

dispute. Simply stated, when facts are in dispute writ will not

lie. (Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board1, Dr. Puvanendran v.

Premasiri2, Wijenayake v. Minister of Public Administration3)

Also it is not the task of this Court in exercising writ jurisdiction

to consider whether the decision is right or wrong but whether

the decision is legal or illegal. (Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v.

1 [1981] 2 Sri LR 471 2 [2009] 2 Sri LR 107 3 [2011] 2 Sri LR 247

Minister of Labour & Vocational Training4 Public Interest Law

Foundation v. Central Environmental Authority5)

Construction of High-Tension Powerlines and its impact, both

positive and negative, is a very specialized subject which the

Courts are ill equipped to handle in a writ application.

In Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority (supra) the petitioner sought to quash the decision of

the Central Environmental Authority approving the construction

of the Southern Expressway by writ of certiorari on the basis

that there was a failure to analyze or consider reasonable and

environmentally friendly alternatives, and the Environmental

Impact Assessment Report does not provide proper intelligible

and adequate reasons for the rejection of alternatives to the

project. By refusing the application, Gunawardena J. inter alia,

at 333 held:

The Court is ill equipped, in any event, to form an opinion

on environmental matters-they being best left to people who

have specialised knowledge and skills in such spheres.

Even if a matter may seem to be preeminently one of public

law, the Courts may decline to exercise review because it is

felt that the matter is not justiciable, i.e. not suitable to

judicial determination. The reason for non-justiciability is

that Judges are not expert enough deal with the matter.

The petitioner in the petition whilst stating that route chage was

done for collateral purposes, has cited the person alleged to have

4 [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248-249 5 [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 at 334

5

politically influenced the authorities to deviate from plan P5(a) to

P5(b) by name in the written submissions. This is to attack the

decision on the basis of bias. A party cannot make allegations

against third parties by name without making the alleged

wrongdoer a party to the case at least for notice. Otherwise that

will amount to abuse the process of Court for collateral

purposes.

The petitioner for the first time in counter objections, tendering

a copy of Guidelines on Wayleave and Felling or Lopping of

Trees issued by the 5th respondent Public Utilities Commission

marked P17(a), taken up the position that, the 4th respondent

Divisional Secretary could not have given permission to wayleave

and the recommendations made by the Divisional Secretary

marked 1R8(a) and (b) are null and void as they are in violation

of item 3 of P17(a). This argument is not clear and not specific.

Item 3 of P17(a) has several clauses.

The petitioner in the counter objections also states that no

proper inquiry was held in respect of recommending wayleave

over the petitioners residential premises. Documents marked

1R11-1R15 bely this contention.

The petitioner in the counter objections further states that the

9th respondent Central Environmental Authority has not

published in the Gazette that the Initial Environmental Report

marked P16(b) has been approved as mandated by the National

Environmental (Procedure for Approval of Projects) Regulations

No.1 of 1993. The petitioner in the written submissions drawing

attention to section 23BB(4) of the National Environmental Act

6

and Regulation 15 of the National Environmental (Procedure for

Approval of Projects) Regulations No.1 of 1993 says that it is

mandatory that any approval for a prescribed project be

published in the Gazette and three national newspapers. The

petitioner does not say that the National Environmental

Authority did not publish the approved project in three national

newspapers. But only complains of non-publication in the

Gazette. This is a technical unintentional breach of a provision

of a statute which has not caused any prejudice to the

petitioner. Hence Court need not quash the decision on that

ground. That shall not be taken to mean that the Court

condones such acts on the part of the authorities.

In Seneviratne v. Urban Council, Kegalle6 the petitioner, relying

heavily on Manel Fernando v. Jayaratne7, sought to quash by

certiorari the order of acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act

inter alia on the basis that Section 2 Notice is bad in law as it

does not contain the public purpose. The counsel for the

respondents convinced Court that the petitioner was aware of

the public purpose for which the land was to be acquired long

prior to the publication of Section 2 Notice and therefore no

prejudice was caused to the petitioner on the failure to mention

the pubic purpose in the Notice. J.A.N. de Silva J. (later C.J.)

accepted the submission of the counsel for the respondent and

quoted at page 108 the following passage on Judicial Review of

Administrative Action by De Smith 5th Edition 1995:

6 [2001] 3 Sri LR 105 7 [2000] 1 Sri LR 112

If the applicant has not been prejudiced by the matters on

which he relies then the Court may refuse relief even

though he has succeeded in establishing some defect. The

literal or technical breach of an apparently mandatory

provision in a Statute may be so insignificant as not in

effect to matter. In these circumstances the Court may in its

discretion refuse relief.

It appears that the petitioner endeavours, as he goes along, to

find some procedural impropriety to assail the main decision

P4(a) which is sought to be quashed by certiorari. That conduct

of the petitioner cannot be countenanced.

Finally I must state that prerogative writs will not be issued as a

matter of routine, as a matter of course or as a matter of right.

It is purely a discretionary remedy to be granted or denied in the

unique facts and circumstances of each individual case. Even if

the party applying the writ is entitled to that relief, still it can be

denied if the other factors stand against granting of that relief.

Other factors will include matters of common benefit as opposed

to individual benefit. (Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Services Ratnapura8, Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne9,

Edirisooriya v. National Salaries and Carde Commission10,

Selvamani v. Dr. Kumaravelupillai11)

The writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition and writ of mandamus

sought cannot be granted.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.

As agreed, the parties in the connected case, CA/Writ/182/2017

will abide by this Judgment.
