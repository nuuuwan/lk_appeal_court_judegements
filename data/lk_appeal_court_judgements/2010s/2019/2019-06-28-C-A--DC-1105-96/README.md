Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs filed this action to partition the land described in the

Preliminary Plan marked X among the 4 plaintiffs and the 1st-7th

defendants in the manner described in the amended plaint. Only

the 1st, 3rd and 4th defendants filed a joint statement of claim.

But, at the trial, in addition to the plaintiffs' issues, without any

objection, issues were raised on behalf of all the defendants except

the 2nd. After trial, the learned District Judge accepted the

plaintiffs' pedigree with regard to devolution of title of Pinhamy's

1/2 share, and left Sinnappu's 1/2 share unallotted. Pinhamy

and Sinnappu are admittedly two original owners, both having

entitled to 1/2 share of the corpus. Being dissatisfied with that

Judgment the 1st defendant has preferred this appeal.

As the learned District Judge has identified in the Judgment1, the

two main issues which had to be determined at the trial were: (a)

whether Pinhamy had a child by the name of Punchi Appuhamy as

asserted by the plaintiffs but denied by the contesting defendants;

and (b) whether the three daughters of Pinhamy, namely,

Punchihamy, Manikhamy and Dingirihamy2 contracted diga

marriages thereby forfeiting paternal inheritance as asserted by the

plaintiffs but denied by the contesting defendants. The learned

District Judge has answered those two issues in favour of the

plaintiffs.

The learned counsel for the 1st defendant-appellant in his written

submissions having drawn attention of the Court to the contents of

the deeds marked at the trial to say that Punchi Appuhamy cannot

be a child of Pinhamy, nevertheless, shown his willingness to forgo

that claim to put an end to this long litigation started nearly 4

decades ago, that is, in the year 1980. Court wishes to place on

record its appreciation of that attitude of the learned counsel for

the appellant in the name of justice.

Now all parties concede that Pinhamy had 7 children: namely, four

sons, Punchi Appuhamy, Kiri Banda, Mudiyanse, Dingiri

Appuhamy; and three daughters, Punchihami, Manikhami and

Dingirihamy.

Then I am left with the question whether the three daughters of

Pinhamy, namely, Punchihami, Manikhami and Dingirihamy,

married in diga. Assuming that Manikhamy was a daughter of

Pinhamy, there is no dispute that she married in diga and

therefore did not inherit from the father. However, there is no

such consensus with regard to the other two daughters, namely,

Punchihamy and Dingirihamy.

Kiri Banda, a son of Pinhamy, sold his share to his sister

Punchihamy by deed marked 1D1. Dingirihamy, a daughter of

Pinhamy, also sold her share to her sister Punchihamy by deed

marked 1D2. Then Punchihamy sold the said two shares and her

own share as a child of Pinhamy to the 1st defendant-appellant by

deed marked 1D3. These deeds were marked without any

objections. If Punchihamy and Dingirihamy did not marry in diga,

the 1st defendant-appellant thereby becomes entitled to 3/12

share of the land.

Have the plaintiffs proved to the satisfaction of Court that

Punchihamy and Dingirihamy entered into diga marriages and left

the ancestral home to live with their husbands? Certainly not.

On behalf of the plaintiffs, the 3rd plaintiff has given evidence. He

was only 54 years of age at that time. In evidence in chief, he has

stated that, whilst Pinhamy was alive, the three daughters married

in diga, and Manikhamy went to Ussapitiya, Dingirihamy to

Haththoradeniya, and Punchihamy to Haloluwa.3 However, in

cross examination he has stated that he was not aware whether

Punchihamy and Dingirihamy were at least married (far from

stating whether it was diga or binna) as he was not even born

when they were allegedly married.4 He has further stated that he

did not have Marriage Certificates to prove their marriages.5

The 1st defendant who was 65 years of age at that time in his

evidence has stated that he was not aware whether Punchihamy

and Dingirihamy were married or not, and in any event, they were

living in the ancestral home.6

The 4th defendant in her evidence has stated that he was not

aware whether Punchihamy and Dingirihamy married in diga7, but

Punchihamy was continuously living in the ancestral home8. Upon

being asked whether Dingirihamy after marriage went to Koswatta,

Kurunagala, he has answered that she was both in the ancestral

home and Koswatta.9 I must pause for a while to say that this

suggestion is different from the earlier standpoint of the 3rd

plaintiff that Dingirihamy after marriage went to Haththoradeniya,

not to Koswatta, Kurunagala. It seems that the plaintiffs are not

firm on that point.

The 3rd and 5th defendants in their evidence have not spoken of

marriages of Punchihamy and Dingirihamy at all.

It is abundantly clear that with this scanty evidence without any

scrap of documentary proof, no Court can come to the firm

conclusion that Punchihamy and Dingirihamy married in diga and

thereby forfeited paternal inheritance. The plaintiffs who asserted

it have failed to prove it to the satisfaction of the Court.

Issue Nos. 23 and 24 raised on behalf of the plaintiffs are on this

matter.10 However issue No. 23 which has been answered by the

learned District Judge in the affirmative is meaningless. It speaks

of the three daughters of Pinhamy contracting second marriages

and not diga marriages! Issue No. 23 is to the point. That issue is

whether the three daughters of Pinhamy have forfeited paternal

inheritance as they have married in diga. This has been answered

in the affirmative, which, in my view, is unsupportable by the

evidence led at the trial. Hence I set aside the finding of the

learned District Judge on that issue and proceed to answer issue

No. 22 on second marriage "Not Proved" and issue No.23 on diga

marriage "No".

Accordingly, Pinhamy's 1/2 share shall devolve on the parties in

the following manner.

1st Plaintiff 6/72

2nd Plaintiff 1/72

3rd Plaintiff 1/72

4th Plaintiff 1/72

1st Defendant 18/72

Subject to the above variation, the Judgment of the District Court

is affirmed.

Appeal is allowed with costs.
