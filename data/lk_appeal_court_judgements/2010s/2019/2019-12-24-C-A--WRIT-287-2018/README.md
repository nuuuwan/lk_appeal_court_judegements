Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The 1st Petitioner had been a Sri Lankan citizen and prior to her marriage had

been known by the name of 'Lalani Kamani Perera'. She states that after her

marriage, she came to be known as 'Kamani Sanot Devnath', and that she

became a citizen of India on 23'd October 2012. The 2nd Petitioner is the

daughter of the 1st Petitioner.

The Petitioners state that they, together with their Un< It- PUI ( haserl a prol.wrty

situated in Kelaniya in 1993, and thus became co-owners of the said property.

A copy of Deed of Transfer No. 4360 executed by M.J.P.De Silva, Notary Public

has been annexed to the petition marked 'Pi'. The Petitioners state that their

Uncle passed away on 11th March 1996 leaving a last will, annexed to the

petition marked 'P2', by which the undivided share held by their late Uncle was

bequeathed to the 1st Petitioner. The Petitioners state that at the time of his

2

death, their late Uncle as well as the 1st Petitioner were residing in India. rhe

said last will had been proved in the High Court of Bombay and letters of

probate, annexed to the petition marked 'P3' had been issued to the 1st

Petitioner. The Petitioners are therefore the present owners ofthe said land.

The Petitioners state that a part of the aforementioned property had been

acquired by the State in terms of the Land Acquisition Act No.9 of 1950, as

amended, for the expansion of the Kelaniya - Mudungoda Road. The Notice

published under Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act has been annexed to the

petition marked 'P4'. The Petitioners state that following the publication of the

said Notice, the Pet itioners made a c1.1im for cornpeno..ltion to thE' 1st

Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Kelaniya.

The Petitioners state further that by a letter dated 23rd April 2018 annexed to

the petition marked 'P6', the 1st Respondent had informed the Power of

Attorney holder of the 1st Petitioner that as the Petitioners were no longer

citizens of Sri Lanka, the Petitioners are not entitled to receive compensation

under the Land Acquisition Act. The 1st Respondent had annexed to 'P6', a legal

opinion tendered by the Hon. Attorney General that in terms of Section 2(1) of

the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act No. 38 of 2014 (the LRA Act),

foreigners cannot hold property and for that reason, the Petitioners are not

entitled to the payment of compensation. I hus, it was untended by the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the 1st Respondent, relying on that

legal advice, had decided not to award compensation to the Petitioners. He

submitted further that the said legal advice is erroneous.

Dissatisfied by the decision of the 1" Re ~) p()lldent to deny the payment of

compensation, the Petitioners have invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court,

seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in 'P6';

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay compensation to

the Petitioners in respect of the land that was acquired.

There are two questions that arise for determination in this application.

The first question is whether the entitlemellt to receive lOmppnsation in terms

of the Land Acquisition Act is limited to citizens of Sri LankJ. This Court has

examined the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and observes that the

purpose of the Notice that is published in terms of Section 7(1) of the Act is

three fold - the first is to inform the intention of the State to acquire the land

referred to in the said Notice; the second is to inform that claims for

compensation for the acquisition of such land may be made to the Acquiring

Officer mentioned in the said Notice; the third is to direct every person

interested in the land which is to be acquired to appear, personally or by an

agent duly authorized in writing, before such Acquiring Officer on a date and at

a time and place specified in the notice, to substantiate such claims.

The purpose of the inquiry that is held thereafter under Section 9 is to

determine inter alia (a) the market value of the land which is to be acquired,

(b) claims for compensation as may have been notified to the Acquirig Officer,

and (c) the respective interests of the persons claiming compensation. The

Land Acquisition Act does not limit the claims for compensation to citizens, but

4

instead considers only whether the person claiming compensation has an

interest over the land. Thus, this Court is or the view that thf' provisions of the

Land Acquisition Act do not confine the payment of compensation to citizens

of Sri Lanka.

The second question that this Court must consider is whether the provisions of

the LRA Act prevent the payment of compensation to persons who have

renounced their Sri Lankan citizenship.

As the LRA Act deals with alienation of lands to foreigners, it would perhaps be

appropriate to examine the evolution of the legal provisions containing

restrictions on sale of land to foreigners. Part VI of the Finance Act No. 11 of

1963\ as amended by Act No. 14 of 1982 ilnu Act No. 2] of I ')92, introduced a

Property Tax equivalent to the value of the entire property where there is a

transfer of ownership of a property in Sri Lanka to a person who is not a citizen

of Sri Lanka2, subject to the exceptions specified in the Act. Part VI of the

Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963 (as amended) was repealed by the Finance Act No.

11 of 2002 and subsequently re-enacted by the Finance (Amendment) Act No.

8 of 2004, subject to certain amendments.

The rationale for its re-enactment is contained in the Special Determination of

the Supreme Court in the Finance (Amendment) 8i113 and is re-produced

below:

1 Sections 58 to 66 in Part VI of the Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963, have been renumbered and reproduced as

Sections 2 to 10 of the "Transfer of Property Tax Act" contained in the unofficial revised edition of the 1980 Legislative Enactments of Sri Lanka.

2 Section 58 of the Act.

3 sc (SD) No. 23/2004.

"Land being a limited resource should primarily be available ta the citizens

of this country and the tax is imposed not only as a rev(>nue measure but

also to set right a disparity in economic terms between non-citizens who

seek to invest in land and citizens who require land to set up a residence or

to eke out a livelihood."

The LRA Act has gone a step further and imposes a complete restriction on the

alienation of lands in Sri Lanka to foreigners, foreign companies and certain

institutions with foreign share holding. The preamble to the Act inter alia

specifies that "it is the National Policy to regulate the use of lands, in a

sustainable manner, having imposed restrictions on the alienation of lands to

foreigners, foreign companies and certain institutions with foreign

shareholding. "

Section 2(1) of the Act reads as follows:

"Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any other written law,

the transfer of title of any land situated in Sri Lanka, shall be prohibited if

such transfer is-

(a) to a foreigner; or

(b) to a company incorporated in Sri Lanka under the Companies Act

where any foreign shareholding in such company, either direct or

indirect, is fifty per cent or above; or

(c) to a foreign company, unless exempted as provided in section 3."

Section 3(1)(d) stipulates as follows:

"The provisions of section 2 shall not apply to (d) any land the title of

which is transferred by intesta( y, gift or tpstamentary dl'position to a next

of kin (who is a foreigner) of the owner of such land, in accordance with

the applicable law of succession of Sri Lanka".

The LRA Act only restricts the alienation of property to a foreigner after the

effective date of the Act, which according to Section 1(2) is deemed to have

come into operation with effect from 1st January 2013.

As observed earlier, the Petitioners became co-owners of the land together

with their Uncle in 1993, and thereafter became entitled to the share held by

their Uncle in 2002. Thus, (a) the 1st Petitioner became the owner of the said

property while she was a citizen of Sri Lanka; and (b) the 2

ncl Petitioner became

a co-owner of the property at a time when there was no restriction on

foreigners owning land.

The Petitioners have acquired the ownership of the said land prior to the LRA

Act coming into operation, and hence this Court is of the view that the

provisions of the LRA Act does not apply to the Petitioners. The LRA Act does

not contain any provisions which deprive foreigners who purchased land in Sri

Lanka prior to the Act coming into operation of their property rights nor does

the LRA Act contain any restrictions on the payment of compensation to such

persons. The subsequent renunciation of Sri Lankan citi7pnship by the 1st

Petitioner and the enactment of the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act after

the Petitioners acquired the said land, do not disentitle the Petitioners to the

rights of ownership that they possessed over the land.

In the circumstances, this Court must hold that the opinion expressed by the

Hon. Attorney General to the 1st Respondent is contrary to the legal position

on this matter. This Court assumes that it is for this reason that the learned

Senior State Counsel did not make submissions in support of the said legal

opinion.

This Court is therefore of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent not

to pay compensation to the Petitioners on the premise that the LRA Act applies

to them, is illegal, and is ultra vires the powers of the Acquiring Officer. This

Court therefore issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision reflected in

'P6'. This Court also issues a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to

pay compensation to the Petitioners in terms of the law, provided the 1st

Respondent has satisfied her entitlement to compensation in terms of the

Land Acquisition Act. This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
