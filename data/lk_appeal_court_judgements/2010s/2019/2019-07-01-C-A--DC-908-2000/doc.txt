cr he Plaintiff Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) eJ instituted this action by a Plaint dated 8.12.1994 against the Defendant

1

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent) praying for a

declaration of title and recovery of possession of the land described in the Plaint. The

following salient points were averred inter alia in the plaint.

a) He had purchased 3 contiguous allotments of a land containing in extent of 18

Acres 1 Rood and 25 Perches from its original owner namely one Wilfred De Silva

by a deed bearing No. 554 attested by W.G. Dharmadasa Notary Public for a sum

of Rupees 50001 ~.

b) The said land was thereafter divided into two lots namely Lot 1 and Lot 2 by Plan

No. 1374 dated 1993 made by G. Warnakulasuriy,a Licensed Surveyor,

c) Thereafter Lot No. 02 of the said land was sold to the Defendant by deed bearing

No. 72 and dated 8.11.1993 attested by one Champa Punchihewa Notary Public.

d) The Defendant commenced to interrupt the peaceful possession of the Plaintiff of

the remaining portion namely Lot 1 of the said land. Lot 1 is the subject matter of

the law suit.

The Defendant filed his amended answer on 3.4.1997 and admitted the corpus and the

title of the Plaintiff to the subject matter. While controverting the other averments in

the plaint, he sought a dismissal of the action and a declaration that the Plaintiff was

holding Lot No.Ol in trust for the benefit of the Defendant under Section 09 of the

Trust Ordinance.

The Defendant by his amended answer raised the following positions inter alia;

a) he entered into possession of the entire land in 1982, adversely in opposition to

the rights of the Plaintiff's predecessor in title namely Wilfred De Silva,

b) owing to the close friendship that existed between the Plaintiff and the

Defendant they had both agreed verbally to purchase the said land in the name of

the Plaintiff but the purchase would be for the benefit of the Defendant and

accordingly a half (1/2) share (Rs.250,000/~) of the purchase price was paid by

the Defendant to the Plaintiff,

2

,'.

c) the Defendant had further agreed to reimburse the balance by authorizing the

Plaintiff to cut down and sell timber in the. said land and once it is fully

reimbursed, the Plaintiff agreed to transfer the title of the entire land to the

Defendant,

d) though the Defendant made repeated requests of the Plaintiff to transfer the

entire property, the Plaintiff tralisfcrred only V2 share of the property by

executing the deed bearing No. 72 in favour of the Defendant,

e) despite many a request, there had been persistent refusal and therefore the

Plaintiff was unjustly enriched,

As the above narrative shows the Plaintiff had bought the entire property in 1992 for

Rs. 500,000r. It would. appear on the assertion of the Defendant that half the

consideration namely Rs. 250,000r was paid by the Defendant. The Plaintiff

transferred Lot No. 02 in 1993 to the Defendant in satisfaction of half the consideration.

The Defendant Respondent seeks a declaration of trust to the other half of the property

alleging an oral agreement between him and the Plaintiff Appellant whereby the

Plaintiff has allegedly ag:-eed to transfer the other half as well to the Defendant

Respondent. In other words having got approximately 9 acres of the 18 acre land, the

Defendant now seeks beneficial ownership of the other 9 acre portion.

The Additional District Judge of Walasmulla has by his judgment dated 18,10.2000

rejected the plaint on the basis that the Plaintiff has not established his case for a

declaration of title to Lot 01 on a balance of probability. In other words the learned

Additional District Judg~,concluded that the Plaintiff was a constructive trustee of the

Defendant and was holding this property in trust for the Defendant. It is against this

judgment that the Plaintiff Appellant has preferred this appeal.

The question arises whether a constructive trust can be declared in favour of the

Defendant Respondent in relation to Lot 01 which is the subject matter of this action.

The Defendant himself admitted giving only Rs. 250,000/~ for the total consideration of

Rs. 500,000/~. Having paid only half of the consideration, can the Defendant now stake

a legal title to the other Iplf of the land? Needless to say, it is only Section 84 of the

3

Trust Ordinance that wouJ;d permit him to claim the o~her half namely Lot 01 provided

the Defendant Respondent satisfies the ingredients of Section 84 of the Trust

Ordinance. Section 84 of the Trust Ordinance goes as follows;

! "Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or

provided by another person, and it appears that such other person did not intend

to payor provide . such consideration for th~ benefit of the transferee, the

transferee must hQld the property for the benefit of the person paying or

providing the consideration."

If the Defendant Respondent~alleges that the Plaintiff Appellant is holding Lot 01 for

" the benefit of the Defendant Respondent, the Defendant Respondent must prove that

Wilfred Silva transferred Lot 01 or half of the entire property for a consideration paid

by the Defendant Respondent. There is no proof that the Defendant Respondent

provided the entire consideration to Wilfred De Silva. in 1992 to enable the Defendant

Respondent to claim the. entire land. For his alleged consideration of Rs 250, 000, the

Defendant had already got lot 2 in 1993. Then how would trust exist for lot 2 in his

favor? He must establish the property was transferred in the name of the Plaintiff for a

consideration provided by him. There is no proof that his consideration, if at all it was

for purchase, was sufficient for lot 2 as well. Obviously there is no such proof and it is

well nigh impossible for the Defendant to allege a constructive trust in respect of lot 1,

as the Defendant Respondent conceded at the trial that he had provided only Rs.

250,000/~to the Plaintiff Appellant in 1992.

There is indeed conflicting evidence as to the purpose for which this sum of Rs 250,

000 was given. Whether this sum of money was for the purpose of contributing to the

purchase price of the entire land or it was just a loan for the Plaintiff figures as two

conflicting versions. Whast the Defendant alleged that it was a part of the purchase

price, the Plaintiff claimed that the purchase price itself was his own money. In other

words according to the Plaintiff, the sum of Rs. 250,000 was only a loan from the

Defendant Respondent to the Plaintiff Appellant. If it is a loan, the borrower of

4

immediately becomes the owner of the lent money and the only obligation on the part

of the borrower is to return the money to the lender upon demand.

In a relationship of creditor and debtor which, as the assertion of the Plaintiff

Appellant goes as between him and the Defendant Respondent, there cannot be a trust

relationship. In other words on the relationship that the Plaintiff Appellant alleged

namely that he only borrowed Rs. 250,000/~ from the Defendant Respondent, a trust

cannot arise. It is only a relationship of creditor and debtor~ see the cases of Foley vs.

):Iill (1848) 2HLC 28, 9ER 1002; Ioachimson vs. Swiss Banking Corporation (1921)

;? KB 110. Both these ca~es are to the effect that onc.e a loan is given, the lent money , . :)ecomes the property of Fhe debtor. So, when the Plaintiff Appellant stated that he

bought the 18 acre land from Wilfred De Silva with his own money, he was disavowing

any suggestion that the Defendant contributed Rs 250,000 for the purchase price.

On 8.11.1993 the Plaintiff Appellant transferred Lot 02 in an extent of 9 acres to the

Defendant Respondent for the sum of Rs. 250,000r which he had borrowed from the

Defendant. In other words the Defendant got his share of the property for the money

that he had expended on rhe Plaintiff Appellant. Notwithstanding this legal position,

the Defendant Responden:: seeks Lot 1 as well on an alleged parol agreement that he had

with the Plaintiff. This parol agreement was to the effect that the Plaintiff had to

transfer Lot 01 as well and he could reimburse himself by cutting teak and satin wood.

This oral agreement wa,s never spoken to by any of the witnesses summoned by the

Defendant.

The witnesses called by t the Defendant said that they were unaware of such an

agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. It is improbable and implausible

for the Defendant to state that the Plaintiff was holding the other half in trust for him.

If at all the constructive trust has to be pleaded under Section 84 and the Defendant

Respondent has failed to establish the ingredients of Section 84.

The Plaintiff had already divested himself of one half of the land to the Defendant and

naturally the other half must belong to the Plaintiff. But when the Plaintiff filed re

5

vindicatio action to Lot 1, the Defendant was seeking to defeat it, by pleading a

constructive trust. On tht evidence the Defendant has not established constructive

trust and therefore his claim for a declaration that Lot 1 belongs to him must fail. No

doubt parol evidence can be proved to establish a trust and there is no proof of a parol

evidence that Lot 01 too would also be transferred.

The Defendant did not provide consideration for the purchase of the other half of the

property and therefore, th~ constructive trust set up under Section 84 would fail. In my

view if at all this unproverlparol evidence was to be understood, the Defendant must be

taken to have pleaded this parol agreement to enforce the alleged promise of the Plaintiff

that he would transfer lot 1 too provided he had recouped his balance sum of Rs

2S0,000 by cutting teak and satin wood. Where did these tree stand? were they on lot 1

or lot 2? If they were on Lot 1, how can the Defendant claim ownership of trees on a

land which does not belqng to him? In any event WflS there any recoupment to the

benefit of Plaintiff by th~lprocess of chopping trees? was there a quantification as to

how much the Plaintiff made by cutting trees? It was not proved at all.

If at all, this parol agreement cannot lay the foundation for a trust but at the most if it is

to be believed, it would amount to an oral promise to a transfer a land to the Defendant

and an oral promise to transfer land would be invalid in view of Section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Or}inance. The learned District Judge has adverted to the

attestation clause of the :deed bearing No. 72 in favour of the Defendant and this

attestation clause refers to a date of execution of the previous deed by which the

Plaintiff obtained a conveyance of the entire land. This attestation clause speaks about

payment of Rs. 2S0,000/- to the Plaintiff Appellant by the Defendant, but it does not

say this payment was for the purpose of contributing part of the purchase money of the

entire land. Thus, a reference to Rs. 2S0,000/~ in the ~ttestation clause as having been .. given by the Defendant Respondent in favour of the Plaintiff Appellant on lyh of

December 1992 is quite equivocal and could equally ~orroborate the assertion of the

Plaintiff that the Defendant gave him a loan of Rs. 2S0,000/ ~ on lSth of December 1992.

6

On an overall consideratlon of the evidence led in this case I take the view that the

Plaintiff obtained title to the entirety of the property in 1992 and in 1993 he transferred

a divided half portion namely Lot 2 to the Defendant for the sum of Rs. 250,0001-. There

is no evidence at all that the Plaintiff was holding Lot 1 for the benefit of the Defendant

on a constructive trust.

Therefore, the unlawful entry into Lot 1 has not been explained by the Defendant when

the title of the Plaintiff to Lot 1 has been admitted. In a rei vindicatio action when the

:ltle resides in the Plaintiff, the burden shifts to the Defendant to show as to how

lawful his possession is hi regard to Lot 1. In the absence of such an explanation and

owing to any absence of, a constructive trust in favour of the Defendant Respondent,

the Plaint could not have been dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge of

Walasmulla. In the circulllstances I set aside the judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Walasmulla dated 18.10.2000 and allow the Appeal of the Plaintiff

Appellant.
