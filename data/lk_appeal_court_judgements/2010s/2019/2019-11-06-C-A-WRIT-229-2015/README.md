Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Geoffrey Alagaratnam, P.C., with Suren

Fernando for the Petitioner.

Sobhitha Rajakaruna, D.S.G., for the 1st and 3rd

Respondents.

Athula Perera for the 2nd Respondent.

Decided on: 05.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking (a) to quash by way

of writ of certiorari the interim order and the final order made by

the 1st respondent marked P8 and P9 whereby the petitioner

employer was directed to pay compensation to the 2nd

respondent employee on the basis that the termination of the

services of the latter was unjustifiable; and (b) to prohibit the 1st

and the 2nd respondents by way of writ of prohibition from

further steps being taken on the said orders.

The petitioner refused to participate in the Labour Tribunal

proceedings initiated by the 2nd respondent citing diplomatic

immunity.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st and

3rd respondents concedes that the petitioner enjoys diplomatic

3

immunity in terms of the provisions of the Diplomatic Privileges

Act, No.9 of 1996, in particular, section 4 thereof.1

The 1st respondent has also either accepted or not contested it in

the impugned orders.

However, the 1st respondent has made those impugned orders

predominantly on the basis that the petitioner has waived off the

immunity.

The 1st respondent has stated that the petitioner had earlier

settled two similar cases, apparently before another division of

that Tribunal. It appears that the 1st respondent has considered

it as a general waiver of the diplomatic immunity by the

petitioner.

Settlement of two cases on good faith without taking up high-

flown technical objections cannot be considered as submission

to the jurisdiction in all future cases. In the present case there

is no submission to jurisdiction. Each case shall be dealt with

separately.

As the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner submits,

there is no universal waiver of diplomatic immunity.

The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has drawn the

attention of this Court to section 2(3) of the Diplomatic Privileges

Act, which runs as follows:

1 Vide page 41A of the Gazette Extraordinary marked P1 and the letter of the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs marked P2.

4

For the purposes of Article 32 (of the Vienna Convention on

Diplomatic Relations), a waiver by the head of mission of

any State or any person for the time being performing his

functions, shall be deemed to be a waiver by that State.

The party alleging waiver of diplomatic immunity shall prove

that the other party with full knowledge of his right abandoned

it either expressly or by conduct which is inconsistent with the

immunity he is entitled to claim. The abandonment of

diplomatic immunity cannot be presumed and the onus of

proving waiver shall be on the party alleging it.

In The British High Commission v. Ricardo Wilhelm Michael

Jansen2 the Supreme Court held that:

There is another principle of law that negatives the

assumption of the High Court Judge that a reference to Sri

Lankan Labour Law in the terms and conditions of the

contract had the effect of waiver. Such a provision that the

Sri Lankan Labour Law would apply to the terms and

conditions was nothing more than an assertion that Sri

Lankan Labour Law was the governing law of the terms

and conditions. Such an assertion would not constitute an

express waiver of state immunity. In fact the case of

Ahmed v. Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

(1996) 2 All ER 248, a Solicitors letter advising the

Government that employees might have certain employment

rights in UK Law could not be interpreted as a written

2 SC Appeal 99/2012, SCM of 10.07.2014.

5

agreement to waive immunity under section 2 of the UKs

State Immunity Act 1978.

In fact the mere recitation that Sri Lankan Labour Law will

apply to the terms and conditions of the contract of

employment is not to be understood as a submission to

jurisdiction as in an arbitration agreementsee Mills v.

USA 120 ILR p.162. In the circumstances I hold that the

covenant in the letter of appointment that Sri Lankan

Labour Law will apply to the terms and conditions is not to

be regarded as a submission to jurisdiction and there is

thus no waiver of immunity on that score.

The 1st respondent has considered the Letter of Appointment of

the 2nd respondent marked P3 and the Framework rules laying

down the conditions of employment of local staff of the

Commission of the European Communities serving in non-member

countries marked P6(1) and (2) to come to the conclusion that

the industrial disputes of the local staff are triable by the

domestic Courts.

The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has narrowed down

this argument to Article 11 of the Letter of Appointment and

Article 23 of the aforesaid Framework Rules.3

Article 11 of the Letter of Appointment reads as follows:

3 Vide paragraph 2.7 of the written submissions.

6

Article 11

The parties hereby expressly declare that any dispute

arising between them as regards the interpretation or

performance of this contract will be referred to an

arbitration body. Such referral may not take place until the

internal appeal procedure laid down in Chapter X of the

Rules laying down the Specific Conditions of Employment

applicable to local staff serving in Sri Lanka has come to an

end; it shall be without prejudice to referral of the dispute to

the court having jurisdiction under local law in accordance

with the first paragraph of Article 23 of the Framework

Rules.

The arbitration body shall consist of two arbitrators, each

party selecting one arbitrator. Should they fail to agree, the

arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator, who will give a

joint award with them.

The arbitrators award shall not be subject to appeal and

shall have the status of an amicable settlement. The

powers of the arbitrators shall last for three months,

beginning on the date of the agreement to seek arbitration.

The arbitrators shall be exempted from all legal formalities

and from the registration of their award, copies of which

they shall send to the parties by registered mail. They

shall determine the costs and fees payable for the

arbitration procedure.

7

Article 23 of the Framework Rules reads as follows:

Article 23

Where an Agreement has been concluded between the

government of the host country and the Commission on the

establishment and the privileges and immunities of the

Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities

in the country in question, any dispute between the

institution and a member of local staff shall be referred to

the court having jurisdiction under local law.

Referral to this court may be preceded by arbitration.

In that backdrop, it is the submission of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the petitioner that, in any event, the 2nd respondent

could not have gone before a local Court without first referring

the dispute for arbitration.

There is no doubt that Article 11 of the Letter of Appointment

contains an Arbitration Clause.

However the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent relies on the

last part of the 1st paragraph of Article 11 of the Letter of

Appointment which states that it shall be without prejudice to

referral of the dispute to the court having jurisdiction under local

law in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 23 of the

Framework Rules to argue that there is no duty by the 2nd

respondent to initiate arbitral proceedings before invoking the

jurisdiction of the local Court. I regret my inability to agree with

that argument.

8

As the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner submits, in

terms of Article 11 of the Letter of Appointment, the employee

has two hurdles to surmount before taking the matter to the

local Court.

Firstly, he shall, after the internal disciplinary procedure is

concluded, follow the internal appeal procedure laid down in

Chapter X of the Rules laying down the Specific Conditions of

Employment applicable to local staff serving in Sri Lanka.

Secondly, he shall refer the dispute for arbitration.

Then what is the meaning of: it shall be without prejudice to

referral of the dispute to the court having jurisdiction under local

law in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 23 of the

Framework Rules found in Article 11 of the Letter of

Appointment?

When there is such an Arbitration Clause, in terms of section 5

of the Arbitration Act, No.11 of 1995, the Court shall have no

jurisdiction to hear and determine such matter if the other party

objects to the court exercising jurisdiction in respect of such

matter. That means, irrespective of having an Arbitration

Clause, the Court shall have jurisdiction, provided the other

party does not object to it. It is only if the other party objects,

the jurisdiction of the Court is ousted.

Hence referral of the dispute to the court shall be understood

subject to arbitration. That is why there is a detailed description

about the conduct of arbitral proceedings in Article 11 of the

Letter of Appointment.

9

The trend of authority is to give full effect to Arbitration Clauses

found in Agreements.4

The only point raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the 1st and 3rd respondents is that, although the petitioner is

entitled to diplomatic immunity, this application for writ is

unsustainable as no writ can be issued against the impugned

orders because the 1st respondent made those orders as a

President of a Labour Tribunal, who is a judicial officer.

I must say that the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent does

not take up such a position.

I think, Article 140 of the Constitution provides the answer to

the concern of the learned Deputy Solicitor General. That Article

reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of

Appeal shall have full power and authority to inspect and

examine the records of any Court of First Instance or tribunal

or other institution and grant and issue, according to law,

orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the judge

of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution

or any other person.

I am of the view that the petitioner can challenge the vires of the

impugned orders by way of a writ.

4 Vide the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Elgitread Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. Bino Tyres (Pvt) Ltd (SC Appeal No: 106/08, SCM of 27.10.2010).

10

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the impugned orders of the

Labour Tribunal are ultra vires as the petitioner is entitled to

diplomatic immunity under Diplomatic Privileges Act, No.9 of

1996.

Accordingly, the impugned orders are set aside, and the

application of the petitioner is allowed, but without costs.
