Janak De Silva J.

This is an application in revision by which the Substituted 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner

has sought inter alia the following reliefs from this Court:

(a) Set aside the judgement and interlocutory decree dated 11.05.2000,

(b) Set aside the final decree if entered,

(c) Set aside the order dated 12.10.2005,

(d) Direct the learned District Judge to fix the case for trial de-novo,

(e) Stay the proceedings in the District Court case bearing no. 22450/P until the final

determination of this application,

(f) Direct the Registrar of this court to list case no. C.A.L.A. 441/2005 together with this

case.

The facts pertaining to this application is as follows. The parties to the District Court action who

were present and represented on 11.05.2000 informed court that they have settled their

disputes and that it is not necessary to answer the points of contest already raised. Thereafter

the Plaintiff gave evidence and the learned District Judge had on the same day accepted the

evidence led by the Plaintiff and delivered judgment as prayed for by the Plaintiff.

The 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner contends that he could not be present in court on

11.05.2000 as he was indisposed but had given instructions to his lawyer. However, Ms. Dayanthi

Udalagama, who was on that day the registered attorney for him had informed court that she

did not have instructions to appear on that day.

The 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner aggrieved by the said judgement filed papers on

24.05.2000 to vacate the settlement and judgment dated 11.05.2000. As there was no provision

to make that application at that time another application was made after the return of the

commission to prepare the final plan in terms of section 48(4) of the Partition Act (Act). The

learned District Judge after inquiry rejected the said application on 12.10.2005 and hence this

revision application.

Page 6 of 10

The learned District Judge rejected the application inter alia on the basis that it did not comply

with the mandatory provisions of section 48(4) of the Act inasmuch the 10th Defendant-

Petitioner-Petitioner failed to comply with section 48(4) (a) (iv) of the Act which reads:

"(a) Whenever a party to a partition action-

(iv) being a party who has duly filed his statement of claim and

registered his address, fails to appear at the trial..."

The issue is whether the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner had filed a valid statement of claim

as the statement of claim filed by him was filed by Mr. C.H. Udalagama.

The learned District Judge correctly observed that there is no journal entry indicating that a proxy

of Mr. C.H. Udalagama was filed on behalf of the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner. The

learned counsel for the Substituted 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner submits that this is

erroneous since Ms. Dayanthi Udalagama had tendered a proxy on behalf of the 10th Defendant-

Petitioner-Petitioner on 25.05.1999 (journal entry 100). The issue is not whether the proxy of Ms.

Dayanthi Udalagama was filed but whether the proxy of Mr. C.H. Udalagama was filed on behalf

of the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner.

Clearly no such proxy was filed. It is trite law that the omission to file a proxy cannot be cured

[Attorney General v. M. W. Silva (61 N.L.R. 500), Dias v. Karawita (1999) 1 SrLL.R. 98]. The learned

counsel for Substituted 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner relied on the decisions in Nelson De

Silva v. Casinathan (55 N.L.R. 121) and S.P. Gunatilake v. Sunil Ekanayake [(2010) 2 SrLL.R. 191].

However, the facts in those cases are different from the facts in the instant case.

In Nelson De Silva v. Casinathan (supra) an application for the execution of a decree was signed

by a proctor in whose favour no proxy had been granted by the plaintiff. It was, however,

established that he was an assistant to the proctor on record and that he had signed the

application on behalf of the latter, and not as a proctor purporting to act independently on his

own responsibility. Further, there was evidence of acquiescence on the part of the defendant

and of ratification by the plaintiff. It was held that in the circumstances the irregularity

occasioned by the absence of a proxy in favour of the proctor was cured.

Page 70fl0

In S.P. Gunatilake v. Sunil Ekanayake (supra) lA.N. De Silva c.J. was of the view that the total

failure to file a proxy does not in any way effect the validity of the proceedings. However, that

was not a case dealing with the application of section 48(4) of the Act. The objection to the proxy

not been filed was in that case taken up in appeal whereas in this case it was taken up before the

District Court. Furthermore, in that case the Supreme Court considered the fact of filing a proxy

belatedly which led to the court concluding that it has succeeded in ratifying the appearances

and applications of the registered Attorney and thereby supplying all such acts with legal validity.

In this case, it was the proxy of Ms. Dayanthi Udalagama that was filed later and not of Mr. C.H.

Udalagama. Hence the question of ratification does not arise.

In fact, J.A.N. De Silva c.J. does state in S.P. Gunatilake v. Sunil Ekanayake (supra, at page 199)

that where no proxy has been filed:

"it is not the proceedings thereunto that are rendered a nullity, but all appearances and

applications made by the proctor or the counsel as his agent." (emphasis added).

Clearly the Supreme Court was making a distinction between the validity of the proceedings and

appearances and applications made by a registered attorney where no proxy has been filed and

held that all appearances and applications made by an attorney-at-law purporting to be the

registered attorney without a proxy or the counsel as his agent are a nullity.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned District Judge correctly held that the application

was not valid inter alia on the basis that it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of

section 48(4) (a) (iv) of the Act.

The learned District Judge also correctly concluded that the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner

had failed to comply with section 19(1) of the Act by failing to file a statement of claim setting

out the nature and extent of his right, share or interest to, of or in the land to which the action

relates and a pedigree showing the devolution of title.

The learned counsel for the 1st to 7th, 9A, 11A and 11B Defendants-Respondents-Respondents

submitted that this application is misconceived in law inasmuch if the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-

Petitioner was aggrieved by the order dated 12.10.2005 pursuant to an inquiry in terms of section

48(4) of the Act the remedy was to file a leave to appeal application. The Supreme Court in Ranjit

v. Kusumawathie and Others [(1998) 3 Sri.L.R. 232] held that where the District Court rejected an

application made by a defendant in terms of section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Act it is an order within

the meaning of section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code from which an appeal may be made

with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had an obtained. The 10th Defendant-Petitioner-

Petitioner has in fact filed a leave to appeal application bearing case no. C.A.L.A. 441/2005 which

is pending in this court.

This court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has given a party an alternative

remedy and when that party has not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances

warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction [Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel and Others (2004) 1

SrLL.R.284].

In terms of section 48(4)(c)(i) of the Act the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner had to establish

that he could not appear at the trial owing to accident, misfortune or other unavoidable cause.

However, he failed to establish that he could not attend due to illness, which is what he averred,

as the learned District Judge held that the evidence of the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner

and the ayurvedic physician summoned on his behalf were contradictory and not credible.

Furthermore, it appears that on 04.12.1995, the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner sought and

obtained permission of court to lead the evidence of one W.A. Somasiri on his behalf as he was

sick and not in a position to give evidence which he failed to do.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the 10th Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner has not established

any exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of this court.

Furthermore, there is more than five years delay from the date of the interlocutory decree dated

11.0S.2000 in making this revision application which is not explained. The question whether delay

is fatal to an application in revision depends on the facts and circumstances of the case

[Gnanapandithan and another v. Balanayagam and another (1998) 1 SrLl.R. 391]. In my view the

facts and circumstances of this case shows lack of diligence on the part of the 10th Defendant-

Petitioner-Petitioner and hence the delay accumulates to his detriment.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application with costs.
