    "text": "It was the view of the Petitioner- Appellant- Respondent that, a party cannot be heard to say of his unawareness of testamentary proceedings as the Court, adhering with the civil procedure, caused to publish necessary notice of the action and the Decree Nisi in newspapers. Not only that, he further says the intervenient parties does not state the manner in which or the specific dates on which they became aware of the present Testamentary Case. Therefore, it was argued by the Petitioner- Appellant- Respondent that intervenient parties are suppressing such crucial fact, which conduct draws the inference that the Intervenient Petitioners were aware of such proceedings from the beginning. It was alleged that they have deliberately refrained from taking any action to intervene.",
