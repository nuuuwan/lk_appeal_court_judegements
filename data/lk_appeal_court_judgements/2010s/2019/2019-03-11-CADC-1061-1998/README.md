Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff bank filed this action in the District Court of

Anuradhapura seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 234,047/78 with

interest. The defendant customer filed the answer seeking

dismissal of the action on the basis that the plaintiffs action is

prescribed. After trial the learned District Judge dismissed the

plaintiffs action. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff bank.

At the trial the only issue raised by the plaintiff bank was

whether the defendant has defaulted the payment of a sum of

Rs. 234,047/78 obtained as an overdraft facility between

15.04.1995-01.10.1995. Conversely, the only issue raised by

the defendant at the trial was notwithstanding a cause of action

has accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant, whether it is

prescribed. ( ,

?)

At the trial, an officer from the bank gave evidence for the

plaintiff and marked the certified copies of the Ledgers relevant

to this transaction as A1 and A2 without any objection and

without subject to proof. The plaintiff in fact tendered these

certified copies of the Ledgers marked A1 and A2 with the plaint

itself. When summons was served on the defendant, together

with a copy of the plaint, these documents have also been served

on the defendant. Those certified copies clearly show that as at

30.09.1995 the defendant was liable to pay to the bank a sum of

Rs.234,047/78. When I go through the evidence of the

plaintiffs witness, it is clear that, the said officer has, when

giving evidence, brought to Court the originals of the Ledgers as

3

well.1 With that evidence, the case for the plaintiff has been

closed reading in evidence the said documents marked A1 and

A2 without any objection.

The defendant has neither given evidence nor called any

witnesses.

In a similar case, namely, Bank of Ceylon v. Aswedduma Tea

Manufactures (Pvt) Ltd2, filed on an overdraft facility, on behalf of

the Supreme Court, Goonaratne J. (with the agreement of

Jayawardena J. and Malalgoda J.) had this to say:

Respondent (customer) never led evidence to establish their

position. Law permits to draw necessary inferences in the

event of the Respondents failure to lead evidence.

Rodrigo v. Anthonys Hardware Stores [1995] 1 SLR 7

The 1st defendant did not give evidence and the court is

entitled to draw the presumption that had he given

evidence, such evidence would have been unfavourable to

the case of the Defendantssee section 114 illustration (f) of

the Evidence Ordinance.

The learned District Judge in the Judgment has rightly rejected

the defendants plea of prescription. There is no cross appeal

against the said finding.

However, the learned District Judge has dismissed the plaintiffs

action on the basis that the plaintiff bank has not produced the

cheques on which moneys were paid to the defendant to

establish that the defendants Current Account was overdrawn

on payments of those cheques.3 I must say that such kind of

specific position (i.e. the plaintiff bank failed to produce

cheques) was not taken up by the defendant at the trial.

The plaintiffs case was not based on cheques. It was based on

the overdraft facility, which the defendant stated cannot now be

recovered as the cause of action was prescribed. When a bank

files a case on an overdraft facility, it was held by the Supreme

Court in Bank of Ceylon v. Aswedduma Tea Manufactures (Pvt)

Ltd (supra) that presentment of cheques to Court is not an

indispensable requirement.

I do agree with the learned counsel for the bank that the

bank does not rely on section 50 of the Civil Procedure

Code, which requires a litigant who relies on a document to

produce the document or even annex it to the plaint. This

was an arrangement between the plaintiff bank and the

respondent. This being an overdraft facility the bank need

not annex a document or the several cheques since there is

evidence of the several bank statements placed and

produced before court. These documents, i.e. the statement

of A/C were produced in court and had been compared by

witness No.2 for the bank with the relevant ledger. This is

not an action based on a cheque but an overdraft facility.

In this case, the defendant did not seriously challenge the

amount per se the bank wanted to recover. By looking at the

issue which he raised, and quoted by me above, it is clear that,

he accepted that a cause of action has arisen to the bank to sue

him, but his defence was that the plaintiffs action was

prescribed.

There was sufficient, if not overwhelming, evidence for the

learned Judge to enter Judgment for the plaintiff once he

decided to dismiss the defendants plea of prescription. When

the Ledgers were brought and certified copies were marked

without objection to establish the granting of the relevant

overdraft facility and default on it, what more the District Judge

expect from the bank? Those certified copies, in terms of section

90A read with 90C of the Evidence Ordinance, present prima

facie evidence without further proof. Regarding the production

of bankers books, in the above case, the Supreme Court stated

that:

There cannot be an objection for leading secondary

evidence. Further the statements produced at the trial is

permissible to be led in terms of section 90A of the Evidence

Ordinance..Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance has

made provisions to deal with bank books, ledgers,

statements etc. Court must consider the proper utilization of

the provisions in the Evidence Ordinance.

This is not a criminal case to prove beyond reasonable doubt,

and to argue that if one link in the chain is missing, the

prosecution's case shall fall apart.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court and direct the

incumbent Judge to enter Judgment for the plaintiff bank as

prayed for in the prayer to the plaint.

This is a simple case filed by the plaintiff bank as far back as in

the year 1996 to recover a specific sum of money. Up to now, 23

long years have passed. This provides a classic example of laws

delays.

Between then and now, Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated

unprecedentedly, and inflation has gone up by leaps and

bounds. These are relevant matters the Court shall inter alia

take into account in awarding costs.

The defendant shall pay to the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 100,000/=

as costs of the appeal.

Appeal is allowed.
