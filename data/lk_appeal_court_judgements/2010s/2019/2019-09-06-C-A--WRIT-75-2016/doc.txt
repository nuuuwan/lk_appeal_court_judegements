Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner being the Attorney of Sumathy Jeyaratnam1 has

filed this application seeking to quash by way of writ of certiorari

the decision made by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents marked

P7 at the Mobile Service for Solving Land Problems; and to

compel the said Respondents by way of writ of mandamus to

give the entire land to the Petitioner on a long-term lease.

By P7 it was decided to divide the land in question in extent

about 10 perches situated in a commercial area in Killinochchi

to three allotments and give them on lease to the Petitioner, the

5th Respondent and the 7th Respondent.

The Petitioners case is mainly dependent upon P2, which is an

Annual Permit issued under the State Lands Ordinance in the

year 1965 in the name of the Petitioners deceased father,

Jayaratnam. In terms of paragraph 1 of the said Permit, it

expired on 31.03.1965.

By the averments of the amended petition, it is clear that the

land has not been continuously in possession of Jayaratnam or

his deceased son, Jeyakumar (who is the brother of Sumathy

Jeyaratnam). The land has been in possession of several others

including the 5th Respondents father, Annalingam. Be it noted

that, in paragraph 6(d), the Petitioner admits the possession of

Annalingam (in or around 1974), and in paragraph 10, speaks of

the possession of the 5th Respondents father and other unlawful

occupants. That is, according to P5, in 1991. In terms of

paragraphs 11 and 12 of the petition also, the possession of the

premises has not been given to the Petitioner.

1 Vide paragraph 8 of the amended petition dated 15.01.2017.

3

The 5th Respondent with his objections has tendered several

documents to this Court to say that Jayaratnam sold the land to

his father, Annalingam. This is denied by the Petitioner. This

Court cannot decide on those vital matters, which are in

dispute.

After the civil war was over, P7 decision has been taken, on the

directions given by the 1st Respondent by 1R1. The 1st-4th

Respondents inform Court that the relevant old documents

relating to this land are non-existent due to long-drawn out civil

war, which is understandable.

I do not think that the decision P7 is arbitrary or unjustifiable.

It is in consonance with written guidelines contained in 1R1

circular. This Court in exercising writ jurisdiction has no

mandate to find the best solution to the problem. Hence

certiorari cannot be issued to quash P7.

The Petitioner has obviously no legal right to the performance of

a legal duty by the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents to give the entire

land on long-term lease only to the Petitioner. Hence mandamus

does not lie.

The Petitioners application is dismissed without costs.
