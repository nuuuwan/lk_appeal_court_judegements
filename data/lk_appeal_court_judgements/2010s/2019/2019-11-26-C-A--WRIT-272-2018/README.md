Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for support on 20th February 2019, the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Senior State Counsel for

the 6th - 9th Respondents agreed that the Order that would be made in this

application would apply to Writ Application No. 273/2018, and that the

Petitioners in that application would be bound by this Order.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article

140 of the Constitution, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the Order dated

2ih November 2017 made by the 1st - 5th Respondents, annexed to the

petition marked 'P4/a),l;

b) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st -5th Respondents

holding that the Petitioner has committed an offence under Section 70 of

the Bribery Act read together with Sections 102 and 113(b) of the Penal

Code;

c) An interim order staying the operation of the said decision marked

d) An interim order preventing the 6th - 9th Respondents from taking steps to

prosecute the Petitioner in a Court of Law.2

1 The 1" Respondent was the Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed by H.E. the President while the 2" - 5'" Respondents were the members of the said Commission of Inquiry.

2 The 6'" Respondent is the Chairman of the Commission to investigate allegations of Bribery or Corruption while the 7'" and 8'" Respondents are the members of the said Commission. The 9'" Respondent is the Director

3

At the time this application was supported, the learned Senior State Counsel

appearing for the 6th -9th Respondents raised a preliminary objection with

regard to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine this application

against the 6th - 9th Respondents.

This Court has been vested with the jurisdiction to issue writs by Article 140 of

the Constitution, which reads as follows:

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall

have full power and authority to inspect and examine the records af any

Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution, and grant and issue,

according to law, orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the judge of any Caurt

of First Instance or tribunal ar other institutian or any other person:

Provided that Parliament may by law provide that in any such category of

cases as may be specified in such law, the jurisdiction conferred on the

Court of Appeal by the preceding provisions of this Article shall be

exercised by the Supreme Court and not by the Court of Appeal"

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that in terms of Section 24 of the

Commission to investigate allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of

1994, "The jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the

Constitution shall, in respect of applications in which relief is saught against the

General of the said Commission. In terms of Section 4 of the CIABOC Act, investigations are conducted by the Commission. In terms of Section 11 of the ClABOC Act, the power to direct the Director General to institute proceedings is with the Commission.

4

Commission, be exercised by the Supreme Court and not by the Court of

Appeal".

In Basil Rohana Rajapakse vs His Lordship Justice Preethi Padman Surasena

and others3 Janak De Silva, J cited with approval the following passage of

Sansoni, CJ in P.A. Anthony Naide v. The Ceylon Tea Plantation Co. Ltd. of

London

4 which correctly summarises what is meant by jurisdiction:

"Jurisdiction is the authority of a Court to exercise judicial power in a

specific case and is, of course, a prerequisite to the exercise of judicial

power, which is the totality of powers a Court exercises when it assumes

jurisdiction and hears and decides a case. In Garthwaite v. Garthwaite5

Diplock, LJ. said,-" in its narrow and strict sense, the jurisdiction' of a

validly constituted court connotes the limits which are imposed upon its

power to hear and determine issues between persons seeking to avail

themselves of its process by reference (1) to the subject-matter of the

issue or (2) to the persons between whom the issue is joined or (3) to the

kind of relief sought, or to any combination of these factors."

Section 24 makes it clear that the authority of this Court to exercise judicial

power in applications filed against the Commission to investigate allegations of

Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) under Article 140, has been removed from this

Court and vested with the Supreme Court, as provided for in the proviso to

Article 140.

5

Even though no final relief in the form of a Writ has been sought against the 6th

- 8th Respondents and the Petitioner is only seeking interim relief against the

6th -9th Respondents, this Court is of the view that where the jurisdiction

conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution has been vested with

the Supreme Court by Act No. 19 of 1994, this Court cannot consider the

granting of any relief against the CIABOC in the course of an application under

Article 140, even though such relief may not be a Writ enumerated in Article

140. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that it does not have the

jurisdiction to entertain this application against the 6th - 8th Respondents, and

therefore upholds the preliminary objection raised by the learned Senior State

Counsel with regard to the maintainability of this application against the 6th -

9th Respondents.

In view of the above finding, the next question that this Court must consider is

whether the Petitioner is entitled to have and maintain this application against

the 1st -S th Respondents, as there is no legal impediment to this Court

assuming jurisdiction in respect of recommendations of the PRECIFAC.

The facts which are relevant to a consideration of the above issue very briefly

are as follows.

The Petitioner states that he joined the Sri Lanka Army in 1980, and had an

unblemished career of 34 years, until his retirement as a Major General in

2014. The Petitioner states that soon after his retirement, he was appointed as

the Director General of the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Centre established

by the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act No. 13 of 200S.

6

H.E. the President, acting in terms of the powers vested in him in terms of

Section 2 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948, as amended, had

appointed the 1st Respondent as the Chairman and the 2nd - 5th Respondents

as members, respectively, of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to

investigate and inquire into acts of corruption, fraud, criminal breach of trust,

criminal misappropriation of property, cheating, abuse or misuse of power or

authority of State resources and privileges, which offences and acts of

wrongdoing occurred during the period 10th January 2010 to 10th January

2015.6 The said Commission of Inquiry was commonly referred to as the

PRECIFAC.

The PRECIFAC had commenced sittings in 2015 and among the many

complaints received by it was a complaint relating to an irregularity that is

alleged to have taken place with the tender for the procurement of

maintenance services of the Tsunami warning towers and the subsequent

agreement that was entered into by the Disaster Management Centre. The

said complaint had been investigated by the PRECIFAC and copies of the

witness statements recorded by the PRECIFAC, as well as the relevant

documentary material have been annexed to the petition marked 'P4'.

The Petitioner states that in its report submitted to H.E. the President,

annexed to the petition marked 'P4(a)', the PRECIFAC had concluded that the

Petitioner has contravened the procurement procedure and had taken

measures to award the tender to a company that had been rejected in the

tender process. As the said acts of the Petitioner were punishable in terms of

Section 70 of the Bribery Act read together with Sections 102 and 113(b) of the

, Order published in Extraordinary Gazette No.1904/57 dated 6" March 2015, read together with the Order

published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1909/42 dated 8" April 2015.

7

Penal Code, the PRECIFAC had recommended that the notes of investigation be

forwarded to the ClABOC for its consideration.

Dissatisfied by the said decision of the PRECIFAC, the Petitioner invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court, seeking the aforementioned relief. In considering the

said relief, this Court would bear in mind the following statement made by

Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil

Service:7

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The

first ground I would call 'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third

'procedural impropriety'.

"By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable. "

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness,s. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

7 1985 AC 374.

8 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB223

8

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it. "

I have described the third head as 'procedural impropriety' rather than

failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with

procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the

decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial review under this head

covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural

rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its

jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any

denial of natural justice."

Paragraph 54 of the petition sets out three grounds urged by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner as to why this Court should grant the

said relief. They are:

a) The said decision/order of the 1st - 5th Respondents or anyone or more of

them are unreasonable and/or arbitrary and/or irrational;

b) The Respondents are public officers and owe a public and a statutory

duty;

c) The Petitioner has no other alternative remedy other than to invoke the

Writ jurisdiction of this Court.

This Court must observe that the matters set out in paragraphs (b) and (c) are

not grounds on which a Writ of Certiorari will lie, and thus, does not merit any

further consideration.

9

The Petitioner is not challenging the legal authority of the 1st - 5th Respondents

(PRECIFAC) to inquire into the said complaint nor is the Petitioner challenging

the legality of the said recommendation.

This Court observes that the Petitioner has not made any specific complaint to

this Court with regard to the procedure that was followed by the PRECIFAC nor

has the Petitioner complained that he did not receive a fair hearing. However,

there is a general complaint that the rules of natural justice have not been

followed. This Court has examined 'P4' in order to ascertain if there is any

merit to this complaint of the Petitioner and find that not only has the

statement of the Petitioner been recorded, his Attorney-at-Law had been

afforded an opportunity of filing written submissions. This Court is therefore

satisfied that the Petitioner has been afforded a hearing as well as an

opportunity of clarifying matters and presenting his side of the story, and that

the requirements of a fair hearing have been met.

That leaves this Court to only consider the complaint of the Petitioner that the

said recommendation by the PRECIFAC is irrational or unreasonable. The

Petitioner however has not elaborated in this regard, either in the petition, or

in the written submissions filed before this Court. This Court examined the

written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner before the PRECIFAC in

order to ascertain the position taken up by the Petitioner before the PRECIFAC.

Having done so, this Court observes that the Petitioner has not denied the

allegation that the tender was awarded to a supplier who was more expensive

than the supplier recommended by the Tender Evaluation Committee, thereby

not only suppressing and/or deviating from the tender procedure but also

causing a loss to the Disaster Management Centre. The position taken on

10

behalf of the Petitioner instead is that his subordinate officers did not apprise

the Petitioner that another supplier had been chosen by the Tender Evaluation

Committee. This position is borne out by the following paragraphs of the said

written submissions:

This Court thereafter considered 'P4(al', which the Petitioner states contain

the recommendations of the PRECIFAC. It appears from 'P4(a)' that another

report pertaining to this investigation had been submitted on a previous

occasion and that what is contained in 'P4(a)' is only a summary. Be that as it

may, it is clear from the said summary that the defence of the Petitioner has

been rejected by the PRECIFAC, and that the 1st -5th Respondents were

satisfied that the awarding of the tender to a tenderer who had been rejected

12

by the Tender Evaluation Committee, and who was more expensive than the

party recommended by the Tender Evaluation Committee, contravened the

provisions of Section 70 of the Bribery Act9.

It is only thereafter that the PRECIFAC had made the following

recommendation:

Taking into consideration the material that was placed before the PRECIFAC

and the defence of the Petitioner, this Court is of the view that the above

recommendation is reasonable. The objective of going through public

procurement is to obtain 'financially the most advantageous and qualitatively

the best services and supplies for the country,.IO If, having gone through such a

process, the tender is awarded to a party who had been rejected during

evaluation, and who is more expensive than the party who had been

' Section 70 of the Bribery Act provides as follows: "Any public servant who, with intent, to cause wrongful or

unlawful loss to the Government, or to confer a wrongful or unlawful benefit, favour or advantage on himself or any person, or with knowledge, that any wrongful or unlawful loss will be caused to any person or to the Government, or that any wrongful or unlawful benefit, favour or advantage will be conferred on any person-(a) does, or forbears to do, any act, which he is empowered to do by virtue of his office as a public servant; (b) induces any other public servant to perform, or refrain from performing, any act, which such other public servant is empowered to do by virtue of his office as a public servant; (c) uses any information coming to his knowledge by virtue of his office as a public servant; (d) participates in the making of any decision by virtue of his office as a public servant; (e) induces any other person, by the use, whether directly or indirectly, of his office as such public servant to perform, or refrain from performing, any act, shall be guilty of the offence of corruption and shall upon summary trial and conviction by a Magistrate be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees or to both such imprisonment and fine."

of Sri Lanka and others (1997 3 Sri LR 20 at 38).

recommended, the objective sought to be achieved is nullified. Therefore, in

the words of Lord Diplock, this Court is of the view that the recommendation

of the PRECIFAC is a recommendation which a 'sensible person who had

applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at'. Thus, this

Court does not see any merit in the argument presented on behalf of the

Petitioner that the said recommendation is unreasonable or irrational.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

notices on the Respondents. The application of the Petitioner is accordingly

dismissed. This Court makes no order with regard to costs.

As agreed upon by all the learned Counsel, this Order must apply to CA (Writ)

Application No. 273/2018. Hence, CA (Writ) Application No. 273/2018 must

also stand dismissed without costs.
