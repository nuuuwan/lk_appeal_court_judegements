Board' chaired by the 2nd Respondent, Principal, Dharmarajah College, Kandy

,. The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Director General of Health Services nad appointed the Petitioner as a

Public Health Inspector with effect from 20th June 2000 and had thereafter

assigned the Petitioner to the Office of Deputy Director of Health Services

Ampara, North - East Province.1 Pursuant to an inter-province transfer granted

to the Petitioner, the Petitioner had been released from his post of Public

Health Inspector, Dehiattakandiya in the Eastern Province with effect from 11th

July 2016. The Petitioner states that he reported for duty at the Department of

Health Services -Central Province on 14th July 2016 and was temporarily

assigned to the Office of the Medical Health Officer, Wilgamuwa in the Matale

District, in the capacity of a Public Health Inspector.2

The Petitioner states that in June 2017 he submitted an application, annexed

to the petition marked 'P2', seeking admission of his daughter to Grade One of

Mahamaya College, Kandy. Admission of students to Grade One of

The Petitioner had sought admission of his daughter to Grade One under

category No.5, namely, 'Children of officers in Government / Corporations

/Statutory Boards / State Banks receiving transfers on exigencies of service.'

The criteria fer selection under the above category are set out in Clause 6.5(a)

of the said Circular, which reads as follows:4

Here the area of school means the relevant institute should be located within a circle drawn with a radius of two kilometers having taken the school as the center. (If interview board requires this circle could be extended as suitable) The applicant should come to the new place of residence with the child from the previous place. Moreover, final place of work shall be considered. Change of residency due to attachments, training programs and study purposes shall not be considered"

.. This Court has examined the interim list of applicants that were chosen after

the interview, marked 'R3' and observes that whil~ the applicant placed first

under the said category had received 100 marks, the other applicants,

including the Petitioner had received identical marks. The Petitioner however

had been placed third in the waiting list.

Dissatisfied with the said decision to place him on the waiting list, the

Petitioner had filed an appeal, as provided for in the Circular 'P4'. The

' .. Petitioner states that when the final list of the successful applicants was

published after the conclusion of the appeals, he found to his dismay that his

daughter's name has been struck off the list and that an applicant who had 93

marks had been selected.

Bya letter dated 29th December 2017, annexed to the petition marked 'Pl0',

the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioner as follows:

"til0m ~O~E ~ H.M.S.S. ~ EldmJeD C!CSe: c5DJeDC.:l OJQ@ SOO 110_

Thus, according to 'Pl0', the Petitioner's application had been rejected for the

reason that the place of work of the Petitioner was located outside the area

where the school was situated.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner filed this application seeking ,

inter alia the following relief:

8

Website Copy Website Copy

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Appeals Board contained

in the letter dated 29th December 2017 annexed to the petition marked

'Pl0" -'

(b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to enroll his

daughter' in accordance with the provisions of Circular No. 22/2017

relating to admission of students to Government Schools.

" I'

In the Statement of Objections filed before this Court, the Respondents took

up the position that in any event, the Petitioner is not eligible to apply under

the said category, since the Petitioner's transfer from the Eastern Province to

the Central Province was not on the basis of an 'exigency of service'.

The question that this Court is therefore called upon to determine is whether

the decision to reject the Petitioner's application seeking admission of his

daughter to Grade One of Mahamaya College, Kandy is in accordance with the

scheme contained in Circular No. 22/2017 marked 'P4' and is reasonable, and

if not, whether the said decision is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

In deciding this question, this Court will first consider the ground for rejection

, set out in 'Pl0', and thereafter the aforementioned ground taken up in the

Statement of Objections.

In considering this application, this Court will be mindful of the following

observations of Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for

9

Website Copy Website Copy

the Civil Service9 with regard to the grounds on which a Writ of Certiorari

couid be granted:

"Judicial review has I think develaped to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The

first ground I would call 'illegality ~ the second 'irrationality' and the third

'procedural impropriety'.

By "illegality" as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable.

By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness'lO. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it."

This Court will now consider whether the Respondents acted outside the

Circular 'P4' when it rejected the Petitioner's application on the basis that the

, 1985 AC 374.

pli:lce of work of the Petitioner was located outside the area where the school

was situated.

, There is no dispute that the Petitioner was working in the Eastern Province and

, , ' that he was released by the Director of Health Services, Ampara with effect

from 11th July 2016 to the Central Province.ll The Petitioner had reported for

duty at the Office of the Department of Health Services, Central Province

situated in Kandy on 14th July 2016. However, due to the service requirements

that prevailed at the Office of the Medical Health Officer, Wilgamuwa, Matale,

the Petitioner had been temporarily assigned to that Office. The fact that the

Petitioner's attachment to Wilgamuwa is on a temporary basis is confirmed by

letter dated 15th July 2016, issued by the Medical Health Officer, Wilgamuwa,12

letter dated 14th June 2017 issued by the Director of Health Services, Central

Province,13 and letter dated t h July 2017 issued by the Medical Health Officer,

Wilgamuwa.14

A detailed explanation of the nature of the Petitioner's transfer to the Central

Province and thereafter his attachment to the Wilgamuwa Office is set out in

the letter dated 8th January 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P3F' issued

by the Director of Health Services, Central Province. Although 'P3F' has been

issued after the decision of the Appeals Board and at the request of the

Petitioner, it confirms the following matters:

1) The Petitioner's permanent place of work is the Kandy District; ,

11 Vide letter dated annexed 13'h July 2016 to the petition marked 'P3B1',

12 Annexed to the petition marked 'P3D',

13 Annexed to the petition marked 'P3C'.

1. Annexed to the petition marked 'P3E',

11

Website Copy Website Copy

2) On seniority, the Petitioner was entitled for an appointment within the

Kandy District. However, whether the Petitioner would have been entitled

to an appointment to an Office within a radius of lOkm from Mahamaya

College has not been disclosed;

3) The Petitioner has been attached on a temporary basis to the Wilgamuwa

Office due to the exigencies of service that prevailed in Wilgamuwa.

If the Petitioner's position is to be summarised, it is that while his transfer is

from the Eastern Province to the Central Province, his place of work is Kandy,

and as his posting to Wilgamuwa is temporary, his daughter is eligible for

admission to Mahamaya College Kandy, on the basis that his place of work

should be considered as being Kandy.

This Court will now examine the position of the Respondents. As noted earlier,

the Petitioner was allocated 95 marks, but was still placed in the waiting list. It

was only at the appeal stage that the Petitioner was disqualified by the

Appeal's Board for the reasons set out in 'PlO'. This Court, having observed

that in their Statement of Objections, the Respondents have not sought to

support the grounds set out in 'PlO' on which the application of the Petitioner

was in fact rejected, except for a passing reference that the 'Petitioner was

released to serve at the Wilgamuwa Health Services Office with effect from

14.07.2016', invited the learned State Counsel to inform this Court the "exact

basis upon which the appeal body headed by the 2nd Respondent decided to

reject the application presented by the Petitioner ... as possibly reflected in the

contemporaneous minutes/records maintained by the 2nd Respondent, and if in

fact there is such a record, to tender a certified copy thereof"

In response, the learned State Counsel submitted '1m affidavit dated 8th July .,

2019 of the present Principal of Mahamaya College, K!lndy, to which affidavit

was annexed the report of the Appeals Board marked 'RB' which reads as

follows:

If, as the Appeals Board states, it obtained details from the Department of

Health Services, Central Province, the Respondents ought to have made use of

the opportunity afforded by this Court, to provide material to substantiate the

said position as well as the position in 'P10', especially in view of the contents

of the letter marked 'P3F'. However, the Respondents, for reasons best known

to them, have chosen not to do so.

15 TR23 is the number of the Petitioner's application,

13

Website Copy Website Copy

This Court will now consider whether the Appeals Board chaired by the 2nd

., Respondent acted reasonably and in compliance with the provisions of the

Circular 'P4' when it rejected the application of the Petitioner or. the basis that

"" , '(he Petitioner's place of work is outside the area of the school. As observed

, , . above, the position of the F"etitioner is that even though he is ilttached to the

Office of the Medical Officer of Health, VVilgamuwa, that it is a temporary

,~ .' attachment, and his per:'iriane'1t place of work is in fact Kandy. This position is

... I ,," J confirmed by the letter ma'rked 'P3F'. This Court cannot ignore the position

taken up by the Director of Health Services, Centrc ~ Province in 'P3F' that the

, Petitioner would have been entitled for an appointment within Kandy and that

his appointment to Wilgamuwa is due to an exigency of service and was

temporary.

/' s observed earlier, quite apart from contradicting the contents of 'P3F', the

contents of which the Respondents state should be disregarded as'it has been

"" prepared after the decision of the A.ppeals Board, the Respondents have

c;:)andoned the ground set out in 'Pi0' that led the Appeals Board to reject the

aPJJiica~i<''1 of th F.: Petitioner.

In these circumstances, this ':ourt accepts the explanation offered by the

Director of Health Services in 'P3F' that the Petitioner was entitled to a posting

in Kandy. As the Respondents have failed to produce any material to challenge

the truthfulness of the contents of 'P3F' with regard to the place of work of the

Petitic:1er or the basis of his assignment to Wilgamuwa, it is the view of this

Court that the decision of the Appeals Board to reject the application of the

Petitioner is R decision 'that no sensible person who had app;;.td his mind ta

14

Website Copy Website Copy

,

the question to be decided could have arrived at' and is therefore

unreasonable.

This Court will now consider the position taken up by the Respondents in their

Statement of Objections that the Petitioner is not eligible to apply under the

category of 'Children of Officers in Government ... receiving transfers on

, exigencies of service', for the reason that the Petitioner's transfer from the

Eastern Province to the Central Province was not on the basis of an exigency of

service.

Even though 'P10' is silent in this regard, this Court is of the view that it should

nonetheless consider whether the Petitioner's transfer to the Central Province

was due to exigencies of service or initi~ted by the Petitioner. This Court is

engaging in such an exercis~ for two reasons.

The first is that, it is mindful that the task before the Interview Board and the

I , , Appeals Board is enormous and that it would not be fair to expect those

persons functioning on such Boards to exercise the kind of scrutiny that this

Court is able to do, especially given the many applications and appeals that

they are required to consider in a short period of time. That does not however

mean that this Court will ignore obvious cases of transgressions of the

provisions of the Circular.

The second reason is that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus

directing the Respondents to perform a legal duty by admitting his daughter to

Mahamaya College, Kandy. If this Court is to issue a Writ 'of Mandamus, this ,

Court must be satisfied that't:-e Petitioner has a legal right, and is in fact

15

Website Copy Website Copy

... '

eligible to have his daughter admitted to Grade One of Mahamaya College,

, . Kandy under the aforementioned category. It is for this reason .hat this Court

afforded the Petitioner and the Respondents an additional opportunity of

placing any material that they v;;sh, with regard to the nature of the transfer of

the Petitioner from the Eastern Province to the Central Province.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that in terms of the

"Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission on the appointment,

promotion and transfer of Public Officers,,/6 a transfer can take place in one of

the following ways:

a) Transfers done annually;

b) Transfers done on exigencies of service;

cj Transfers done on cisciplinary grounds;

d) Transfers pursuant to mutual requests.

Paragraphs 218 to 221 of the said Rules relate to transfers on exigencies of

service and reads '3S follows:

"218. A Public Officer may be transferred on exigencies of service by the

Appointing Authority for anyone of the following reasons:

(i) Where the services of an officer is no longer needed at his present

station;

"Published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1589/30 dated 20" February 2009.

16

Website Copy Website Copy

,

(ii) Where an officer is needed for service in another station or that

particular officer himself is needed;

(iii) Where it is found, due to administrative reasons, that the retention of

an officer in his present station is not suitable.

Even though a transfer can take place in anyone of the above methods,

; ' ," Circular 'P4' gives recognition only to the children of those Public servants who

have been transferred to another station on the basis of an exigency in service

as set out in Rule 218. The rationale for limiting it to this category is simple. A

public officer who is well settled with his family at a particular work station and

who is all of a sudden asked to report to another station, with his family, to . . fulfil the requirements of the employer, cannot be left in the lurch as far as the

education of his children are concerned. Hence, the preferential treatment

,. given to such public servants, at least as far as the education of their children

are concerned. However, no such concession can be given to Public servants

who voluntarily and wilfully seek a transfer and it is for that reason that 'P4'

makes it abundantly clear that where the transfer was at the request of the

<lpplicant, such person shall not be eligible to apply under the said category .

. , It was the position of the learned State Counsel appearing for the

,. Respondents, as morefully borne out 'by the Statement of Objections and the

supporting affidavit of the .'i'i~ Respondent, Principal, Dharmaraja College,

Kandy who ~as the Chairman of the Appeais Board, that the Appeals Board ,

had meticulously examined the documents submitted by the Petitioner and

had discovered that even though the Petitioner had sought admission under

17

Website Copy Website Copy

the category of 'Transfers on service exigencies', the Petitioner's transfer had

been at his request and not on the basis of an exigency of service.

This Court, having examined the documents submitted with the petition, and

the documents that have been submitted pursuant to the clarifications sought

by this Court on 1st November 2019, observes the following:

a) The Petitioner had submitted an application seeking a transfer on 9

th

September 2015. A copy of the said application has been produced by the

Respondents, marked 'R14'.

b) The said application 'R14' contains inter alia the following information:

(i) The Petitioner's wife is working at the Technical College, Aruppola,

within Kandy;

(ii) The Petitioner's two elder children are schooling at 5t. Sylvester's

College, Kandy and Wariyapola Sri Sumangala Vidyalaya;

(iii) The reason for the transfer is given as follows: I/J<lm ~@ (5)9 O{;lI:lS

The very nature of a transfer on exigency of service is that it happens without a

request by the employee and in order to fulfil the requirements of the

employer. It is for that reason that the Rules of the Public Service Commission

contain the following provisions, so that this method of transfer cannot be

abused by an employer.

"219. Before a Public 'Officer is transferred on exigencies of service, the

Authority with Delegated Power shall personally satisfy himself

that need has actually arisen as specified in Section 218 above and

that the transfer canl!ot be deferred till the next annual transfers.

220. Depending on the nature of the need for services that has arisen,

the Appointing Authority may transfer an officer at short notice.

221. The Appointing Authority shall record in the relevant file deafly all

the factors that caused the transfer of an officer on exigencies of

service. The Appointing Authority shall convey the reasons to the

officer concerned."

If the Petitioner had in, fact been transferred from the Eastern Province on the

basis of an exigency of service, the re?sons for such transfer would have been

conveyed to the Petitio.n~r in writing. However, no such letter was produced to

this Court, notwithstanding this Court directing the Petitioner to produce the , ,

letter of transfer issued to him under Rule 221.

In his affidavit dated 15th November 2019, the Petitioner has sought to state

that he was brought to Kandy in order to satisfy, the exigency of service that

prevailed in Wilgamuwa. If that be so, the Petitioner cannot claim that he was

entitled to an appointment in the Kandy District and that his attachment to

Wilgamuwa was temporary. Furthermore, this argument is contrary to the

aforementioned documents, which makes it clear that the transfer process was

initiated by the Petitioner hir1)self, a fact that the Petitioner did not disclose to

this Court, but which transpired only because this Court called for clarifications

from the parties.

The Petitioner having initiated the transfer process, the above documents

clearly establish that the Public Sector machinery thereafter processed his

application on the basis that it is a 'Inter Provincial Transfer', and not on the

basis of a transfer on an exigency of service.

As observed earlier, the position of the Respondents that the Petitioner's

transfer was not , on the basis .of an exigency of service, has been clearly

pleaded in paragraphs 5, 7, 8, lO(f) and l2(d) of the Statement of Objections.

This Court has examined the Counter affidavit of the Petitioner and find that

21

except for a mere denial, the said affidavit has not addressed the said issue. In

paragraphs 8 - 11 of his affidavit dated 15th November 2019, the Petitioner has

sought to 'justify' his position that his transfer was as a result of an exigency.

However, in the said averments, having admitted that he made an application,

the Petitioner has tried to twist the facts and even gone to the extent of

stating that he received his transfer only in July 2017, when the documents

clearly establish that the Petitioner was transferred from the Eastern Province

in July 2016.

There is one other matter that this Court must refer to. The Circular 'P4'

required the Petitioner to have be~ n resident in the Eastern Province with his

family including the child whose admission is sought and thereafter to relocate

to the Central Province with h:s ent;re family. As observed earlier, in his

application 'R14', the Petitioner had aO"Tlitted that his wife is employed at

Aruppola and that his two elder children are schooling in Kandy. These two

factors, together with the reason given in 'R14' for the transfer, can lead to the

conclusion that the family of the Petitioner was not living with him in the

Eastern Province. Thus, on this ground too, the Petitioner was not eligible to

apply under the Transfer category.

The necessity for this Court to quash 'Pl0' does not arise in the above

circumstances as this Court is satisfied that the Petitioner's transfer from the

Eastern Province to the Central Province was not on the basis of an

exigency in service. The Petitioner is therefore not entitled to a Writ of

Mandamus seeking admission of his da~ghter to Grade One of Mahamaya

College, Kandy under the category of 'Children of officers in Government/

22

.: .

Corporations/ Statutory Boards/ State Banks receiving transfers on exigencies

of service'. The application of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed. Taking

into consideration all of the circumstances of this case, this Court makes no

order with regard to costs.
