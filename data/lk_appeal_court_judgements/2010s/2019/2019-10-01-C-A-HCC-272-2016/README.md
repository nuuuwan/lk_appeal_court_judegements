o I. Accused-Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo on 1st and 2nd counts for trafficking and being in possession of

13.51 grams of Heroin respectively. After trial the learned High Court

Judge acquitted the Appellant from count No.1 and convicted for count

2

No.2 and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. Being aggrieved by the

said conviction for count No 2, the Appellant preferred the instant Appeal

on the following grounds;

1. The learned Trial Judge has not taken into consideration that

the version of the prosecution relating to the arrest of the

Accused Appellant fails the test of probability and credibility.

2. The learned Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to evaluate

that the prosecution has not proven the 'chain' relaying to the

inward and outward journey of the production.

Ground No.1

02. Learned President's counsel for the Appellant submitted that according to

the evidence for the prosecution PW 1 Inspector Lankadeva has received

the information about the Appellant at 21.20 hours on 03.05 2013. The

information had been that the Appellant was on the road between

Seewalipura school and the railway gate keeping heroin in his possession.

He had made out entry at 22.12 hrs. and had left the camp at 22.30. It had

been about 23.00 hrs. by the time he arrived at the place where the

Appellant was. The contention of the Counsel for the Appellant is that it

is highly improbable for the Appellant to wait there on the road for about

1 hour and 40 minutes unti I the police team arrived at the scene.

03. Position taken by the defence was that the Appellant was arrested by the

police when he was at home with his father and the uncle.

3

04. PW2 SI Dinesh Sanjeeva Gnanaratne who took part in the raid also has

given evidence corroborating the evidence of PWI. Although, he had

been cross examined at length by the defence he had testified without any

contradiction that goes to the root of the matter.

05. Learned Trial Judge who heard the evidence of the witnesses who

conducted the raid had been satisfied about the credibility of the

witnesses. The Appellant in his dock statement has not mentioned

anything about any previous enmity between the official witnesses who

conducted the raid to implicate the Appellant falsely.

06. In case of Attorney General V. Mary Theresa {20lll 2 Srj L.R. 292 at

page 304, Her Ladyship Justice Shiranee Thilakawardene said;

"Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. Appellate

Judges have repeatedly stressed the importance of the Trial

Judges ' observations of the demeanor of witnesses in deciding

questions offact. ... No doubt the Court of Appeal has the power to

examine the evidence led before the High Court. However, when

they go so far as to conduct a demonstration of the evidence, they

observe the material afresh and run the risk of stepping into the

role of the original Court. ... The Trial Judge has a unique

opportunity to observe evidence in its totality including the

demeanor of witnesses. Demeanor represents the Trial Judge's

opportunity to observe the witness and his deportment and it is

traditionally relied on to give the Judges ' findings of fact their rare

4

degree of inviolability. (Vide. Bingham. 'The Judge as Juror ' 1985

p.76)"

07. The learned Trial Judge after observing the witnesses and analyzing the

evidence has concluded that the evidence of the witnesses for the

prosecution who conducted the raid to be credible and did not find the

raid to be improbable. Hence, there is no reason for this Court to overturn

trial findings of fact that is supported by the evidence. Hence, this ground

of Appeal should fail.

Ground No.2

08. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the police officers who

conducted the raid have failed to comply with section 77A (1), (2) and (3)

of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act. It is the

contention of the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant that in

terms of section 77(A)( I), the officer who seized the illegal drug, himself,

has to hand over the same to the Government Analyst. In this case,

although the chain of officers who handled the seized drugs had given

evidence, the drugs were handed over to the Government Analyst not by

IP Lankadeva who seized it, but by Officer IP Rajakaruna (PWIO).

Evidence of IP Rajakaruna was that he handed over the productions to

Government Analyst on 04.05.2013. Prosecution has led the evidence to

prove the chain from the seizure to handing over the drugs to the

Government Analyst. The issue raised by the Counsel for the Appellant is

that it was incumbent upon IP Lankadeva who seized the drugs to take

the drugs to the Analyst by himself.

5

09. Previously there was no provision for the police officers who conduct

raids and seize illegal drugs to send the drugs directly to the Government

Analyst for analysis. The procedure was to send the productions to the

Government Analyst through the Magistrate's Court. By section 8 of the

Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, additional

provision was made for the police officers who seize drugs to directly

take the drugs to the Government Analyst. This provision was obviously

made to effectively and expeditiously get the illegal substance seized

analyzed without following the long procedure through Magistrate's

Court. However, it is of utmost importance that the same production that

was seized is handed over to the Government Analyst without making

any room for tampering or interfering with the same.

10. In the instant case clear evidence had been led by the prosecution on the

chain to prove that the seized productions were handed over to the

Government Analyst without any tampering. From the time IP Lankadeva

seized the drugs from the Appellant to the time IP Rajakaruna (PWIO)

handed over the same to the Government Analyst Department clear

evidence had been led by the prosecution without breaking the chain.

Hence, no prejudice has caused to the Appellant on the analysis of the

drugs, by IP Lankadeva himself not taking it to the Government Analyst.

It has not caused any miscarriage of justice. Article 138(1) of the

Constitution provides that no Judgment, decree or order of any Court

shall be revised or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

II. In case of Perera V. Attorney General [1998J 1 Sri L.R. 378 at page 380

Court held;

'It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove that the productions had been forwarded

to the Analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any

suspicion that there had been no opportunity for tampering or

interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst.

Therefore, it is correct to state that the most important journey is

the inwards journey because the final Analyst report will depend

on that. The outward journey does not attract the same

importance. '

12. However, there is no issue raised, and an admission had been recorded on

13.01.2016 by the defence that they do not challenge the Government

Analyst report and the outward journey. In the above premise ground of

Appeal No.2 also should necessarily fail.

13. Learned Presidents' Counsel for the Appellant brought to the notice of

the Court that the Witness Lankadeva has given contradictory evidence

on placing the imprint of the Appellant on the parcel when it was sealed.

It is clear that it was a genuine mistake and on perusing the notes he had

given the correct version. It would not affect the credibility of the PW 1.

7

Hence, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on the Appellant

by the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
