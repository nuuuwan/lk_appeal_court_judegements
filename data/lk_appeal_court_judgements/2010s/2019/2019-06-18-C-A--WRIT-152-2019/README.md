Hon. Justice Janak De Silva.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners heard in support.

He submits that he is affected by the quit notice marked A21 and the

subsequent proceedings instituted in the Magistrate's Court of Angunukola

Palassa by A22. He submits that the petitioners have lawful title to the land in

dispute in terms of deeds marked A4, A5, A6 and A9 and therefore the Land

Reform Commission could not have proceeded under the State Lands Recovery of

3

Possession Act to recover the possession of the land in dispute. It is further

submitted that the land belonging into the Land Reform Commission is reflected

in final village plan 325 whereas the land which is in dispute falls within final

village plan 326.

Learned President's Counsel for the 1 st and 3rd Respondents draws

attention to the deed marked A4 by which part of the land in dispute had been

transferred to one Waidyasiri by Punchiappu and the said deed refers to a land

situated in East Giruwa Paththuwa. He accordingly submits that the balance

portion of the said land which the petitioners alleged devolved on the

descendants of Punchiappu and reflected in Deed of Gift A4 and A5 and on

the Petitioner by A9 is contradictory in as much A4 refers to land situated at

South Giruwa Paththuwa.

On a perusal of these deeds it is clear that the pedigree which began in

relation to a land in East Giruwa Paththuwa has been changed in 2014 to a

land in South Giruwa Paththuwa.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner also relies on document

marked A16 (i) to show that the land belonging to the Petitioners is situated

within final village plan 326 where as the land belonging to the Land Reform

Commission is within final village plan 325. However the said document has not

4

been certified by a licensed surveyor and in term of Section 13 of Survey Act (-

No: 17 of 2002 this court cannot take cognizance of this document as evidence.

Further, in Dayananda Vs. Thalwatta 2001 2 SLR 72 this Court has held

that the institution of proceedings in the Magistrate's Court in terms of quit

notice is not a determination affecting legal rights warranting the issuance of a

writ of certiorari. It was open for the petitioners to seek to quash the quit notice

by way of certiorari when the determination was made by the competent

authority or to move in revision at the conclusion of the Magistrate's findings.

For the foregoing reasons Court is of the view that this is not a fit matter

for notice. Accordingly, notice is refused. No order for cost.

I agree.
