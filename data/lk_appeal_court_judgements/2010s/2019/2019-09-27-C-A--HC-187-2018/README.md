ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

The accused-appellant was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General

for committing the offence of grave sexual abuse on Jayage Nirosha

Jayaratne at Horowpatana, on or about 21.11.2011. After a full trial before the

High Court of Anuradhapura, the accused-appellant was found guilty to the

said offence and, on that account, was imposed a sentence of seven-year

term of imprisonment. In addition, the accused-appellant was to pay a fine

of Rs. 10,000.00 which carried a three-month term of imprisonment in

default. The accused-appellant was to compensate the prosecutrix with a

payment of Rs. 50,000.00 and a six-month term of imprisonment was

imposed in default.

2

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused-

appellant sought to challenge their validity on the basis that the trial Court

had fallen into error when it failed to consider that:

a. It was a consensual act,

b. there was no independent corroboration of her evidence, and

c. the Ellenborough principle does not arise, in view of the evidence

presented by the prosecution.

The prosecution case is entirely based on the evidence of the

prosecutrix's version of events and, to a limited extent, on the medical

evidence in relation to the abrasions noted on her elbow. It is her evidence

that she is a mother of a 9-year-old physically challenged girl child.

Nirosha's husband had left her in 2010 and since then she lived with her

grandmother. The land on which they lived had no fence and was

surrounded by shrubs. Closest to her house was the house of one

Premadasa, but it was abandoned for some time. There was no electricity

and usually they went to sleep by 7.30 p.m.

On the day of the incident, she had slept inside the house with her

child and at about 8.00 p.m. she went out to the front compound to answer

a call of nature. She had her electric torch with her and had squatted about

15 feet away from the entrance to her house. She then heard someone

approaching her from behind. The intruder had then held a piece of cloth

against her mouth and dragged her to a "tractor shed" on Premadas's land.

She identified the accused-appellant as he is a known person from the

same area. He had held her against a post of the shed and indicated his

3

desire to have sexual relations with her. She had struggled with him when

he put her down on floor. She was threatened with death. The accused-

appellant attempted to penetrate her but only managed to have intercrural

sex. Then she heard her child crying and grandmother's calling for her.

With this window of opportunity, she managed to run back to her house.

She narrated the whole incident to her grandmother and also to her

mother who advised her to report to Police on the next morning which she

did. She was produced before a medical officer on 22.11.2011 at 11.45 a.m.,

who noted fresh abrasions on her right elbow and also noted wetness in

the groin area, which he suspected as seminal fluid.

The accused-appellant, in his statement from the dock, stated that in

that evening he met Nirosha who requested him to find her husband and a

job in return of a " ~oo c<;BClt:il ". He agreed. He had gone to see her after

dark. She came out of the house and walked to a place away from the

house. However, she was not in favour of vaginal intercourse. Then they

engaged in intercrural sex. She had left him when her child woke up and

cried.

The contention of the accused-appellant on the failure of the trial

Court to consider the issue of consent is based on his position that was put

to Nirosha and taken up in his statement, that it was on her request that he

performed the sexual act in return of his undertaking to secure her a place

of employment in Colombo. The suggestion by the accused-appellant that

they had a prior relationship was denied by Nirosha by replying that it's a

lie.

4

In rejecting the accused-appellant's claim of consensual intercrural

intercourse, the trial Court had considered the relative probabilities of the

conflicting versions of the sequence of events each of them have described

before it and ruled that his position did not create any reasonable doubt in

its mind, and thereby effectively rejecting the claim of consent. The trial

Court had relied on the evidence that she had abrasions, the fact that her

dress was soiled and she had complained to her grandmother and then to

her own mother who directed her to lodge a complaint to the authorities

without delay, in arriving at the conclusion that the evidence of Nirosha is

probable and therefore credible and truthful.

This Court finds no error in arriving at the said conclusion by the

trial Court. The accused-appellant was not consistent with his position

during his cross examination of Nirosha and his statement from the dock.

During cross examination, the accused-appellant suggested to

Nirosha that they had a clandestine relationship. She denied it. Then it was

suggested to her that she requested the appellant to make an arrangement

to secure an employment for her, a few days prior to that particular

evening and she would return the favour in any form. She denied this

suggestion as well. However, the accused- appellant, in his statement,

brings the prior meeting on to the same evening. Then he adds that she

wanted him to search for her husband in addition to securing her an

employment. He was specific that she herself offered " 3)00 G<;Oelc\ " in

return. However, the accused-appellant when making his statement from

the dock did not suggest her of the particular nature of help offered by

Nirosha. Similarly, although he stated in the dock statement that Nirosha

5

invited him to come to her house that evening, he failed to suggest that

position during his cross examination of her.

In support of his contention, the accused-appellant sought to

challenge the probability of the version of events as spoken to by the

prosecutrix. He relied on the words used by grandmother when she

questioned Nirosha upon her return to the house as to where she was

(" <3O)j <3c)<33l1; 61<30"). This was due to the fact her child started crying, in

the absence of her mother. The accused-appellant sought to impress upon

this Court the wording used by the grandmother is indicative of the fact

that Nirosha was away from her child for some time surreptitiously, in

support of his suggestion to her that she was away from home voluntarily,

in order to fulfill her part of the offer in return of the favour she expected

from the accused-appellant.

Applying the test of probability on the evidence of the prosecutrix,

if this was a consensual act as the accused-appellant claims, she could have

offered any explanation justifying her going out of the house in the night,

when her grandmother enquired where she had been. She did not have a

compelling reason to admit having any sexual relations with anyone as her

grandmother did not see and know who she was with at that point of time.

Even if she had to admit the consensual sexual act, she could have easily

said she could not identify the person who forced his carnal desire on her.

Being a married woman and a mother, she could have easily implicated

the accused for committing rape, instead of grave sexual abuse. There is no

valid explanation as to why the prosecutrix had given the appellant such a

"concession" by implicating him for an offence which is comparatively of a

lesser criminality, if that is not what exactly happened. Only three of them 6

knew that she was out of the house. No outsider had witnessed that she

was with the accused-appellant that night. Hence, she was not under any

compulsion to disclose the identity of the person with whom she had

consensual sexual relations, in the absence of any witnesses or an

allegation of wrong doing.

This Court therefore is of the view that the trial Court had rightly

concluded that the sexual act is not a consensual one. This determination

on a question of fact by a trial Court is well supported by the evidence

presented by the prosecution.

It has been consistently held by this Court that, in proof of an

allegation of rape, the rule of prudence that there should be some

corroboration, is not an absolute one. The authority relied upon by the

accused-appellant, Ajith v AttorneJ} General (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 23 itself is

indicative of this view. Unlike in that particular instance, in the instant

appeal, Nirosha's evidence does not contradict the medical observations. In

the contrary, it supports her claim that she sustained an injury when she

was held against the unplastered brick column.

Thirdly the contention by the accused-appellant that the trial Court

had erroneouly applied Ellenboro ugh principle, should be examined. It

must be observed that the trial Court had considered the unacceptability of

the position taken up by the appellant and therefore has held that he did

not offer a valid explanation to the allegation of grave sexual abuse. The

legality of the applicability of Ellenborough dictum by the trial Court is

questionable in relation to the instant appeal. However, that had not

caused any prejudice to his right to a fair trial or had occasioned a failure

7

of justice. The trial Court had clear, truthful and reliable evidence of

Nirosha and had medical evidence which is not inconsistent with her

version but supportive of it in order to convict the accused-appellant.

The three grounds of appeal that have been relied upon by the

accused-appellant are without any merit. In the circumstances, the

conviction and sentence imposed on the accused-appellant by the trial

Court are hereby affirmed.

Appeal of the accused-appellant is accordingly dismissed.
