The accused-petitioner-appellant filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of

the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North Western

Province holden in Kurunegala dated 12.09.2006 in Case No. HCR 35/2006 and

seeking to set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala dated

28.07.2006 in Case No. 26570.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was

charged in the Magistrate's Court of Kurunegala for having manufactured and

distributed a bottle of Ginger Beer with a bent straw inside and thereby committed

an offence punishable under section 18(1)(a) read with section 2(1)(b) of the Food

Act No. 26 of 1980. The productions were produced in the Magistrate's court on

Page30f9

14.08.2003 whereas the offence was cOIIll1)itted on 13.08.2003. The Learned

Magistrate called for a Government Analyst's Report of the productions on

14.08.2003 and the said report was produced in the Court on 28.10.2004. The

Government Analyst's Report mentioned that an examination of the contents of the

bottle revealed the presence of a straw and pale yellow turbid liquid. It was further

mentioned that there was no evidence for any tampering of the stopper.

Upon receiving the Government Analyst's Report, on 28.10.2004, the Public

Health Inspector (hereinafter referred to as the 'respo~ent') had informed the

Learned Magistrate that a complaint would be filed in the Magistrate's Court.

Accordingly the complaint and a charge sheet were filed on 07.0l.2005 and the

appellant was noticed. In the charge sheet, the appellant was named as the

Manager, Ceylon Cold Stores LTD. On 25.02.2005, one P. D. Sugathapala

appeared on behalf of the Ceylon Cold Stores LTD and on 04.03.2005, the charge

sheet was read to the said representative of the appellant. He pleaded not guilty to

the charge. Thereafter the case was fixed for trial on 20.05.2005. The appellant

raised a preliminary objection that the proceedings cannot be maintained as it had

not been instituted against a natural or juristic person but against a non-existing

person. Both parties had made submissions on this matter and on 22.07.2005, the

Learned Magistrate fixed the case for trial dismissing the preliminary objection.

The appellant preferred an application for revisio~, against the said order dated

22.07.2005, to the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala under case No. HCR

66/2005. The Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned

Magistrate and dismissed the said application without issuing notices to the

respondents.

Thereafter, the case was agam fixed for trial in the Magistrate's Court on

1l.1l.2005. However, the dates were moved by both parties in three occasions due

Page 4 of 9

to non-availability of the prosecution witnes~es and the appellant. Therefore the

trial was not commenced. The appellant, on 16.06.2006, raised a preliminary

objection in terms of section 20(1) of the Food Act. The Learned Magistrate

overruled the said objection under section 39 of the Judicature Act, by the order

dated 28.07.2006.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 28.07.2006, the appellant preferred an

application for revision to the Provincial High Court of North Western Province

holden in Kurunegala. The Learned High Court Ju8ge had dismissed the

application on 12.09.2006, without issuing notices to the respondent, stating that

the preliminary objection was raised after the matter was fixed for trial.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant filed this appeal.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant contended that the complaint

was filed only on 07.01.2005 (page 119 and 125 of the brief), after the prescribed

three months period, as stated in section 20 of the Food Act.

The Learned SSC for the respondents contended that the appellant was not entitled

to raise an objection to the jurisdiction after pleading not guilty to the charge. It

was further argued that the appellant did not raise this objection on the basis of

prescription until the trial was fixed and dates were moved in several occasions.

I observe that as per section iO(I)(b) of the Food Act as amendment by Act No. 20

of 1991, a prosecution for an offence under the Act shall not be instituted "after the

expiration of three (3) months from the date of detection of that offence or where

sampling is done, from the date of sampling". In the instant case, the complaint

was filed on 07.01.2005, nearly after one and a half years of detection of offence.

In the said complaint, it was mentioned that the complaint has been filed in terms

of section 136(I)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Both the Learned

Page 5 of 9

Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judgfl was of the view that failure to raise

the said preliminary objection as early as possible should be considered as a waiver

on the part of the appellant.

The Learned SSC for the respondents submitted following cases in support of her

contention;

1. Sunanda Pathiraja V. OIC, Police Station, Kalutara North rCA (PHC)

18112014 - Decided on 31.05.2019]

2. The case ofNavaratnasingham V. Arumugam arid another (1980) 2 S. L.

R. 01, in which it was held that,

"In any event, an objection to jurisdiction such as that in the present

case must by virtue of section 39 of the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978,

be "taken as early as possible, and the failure to take such objection

when the matter was being inquired into must be treated as a waiver

on the part of the petitioner ... "

3. The case of Senarath Pathiranalage Gunathilake V. S.P. Sunil

Ekanayake [SC Appeal No 26/2009 - Decided on 15.12.2010], in which it

was held that,

"There are certain objections which must be raised at the earliest

opportunity available. The objection io the jurisdiction of a Court is

one ...

In my view this is because of the effect of the failure giving rise to the

objection, that such promptness is required ... "

In light of above, it is understood that certain objections must be raised at the

earliest opportunity. However, I think that the tenn 'earliest opportunity' cannot be

Page 60f9

interpreted to be the very first date after filing of the complaint and such 'earliest

opportunity' could vary according the proceedings of each Court. I observe that the

complaint in the instant appeal was filed on 07.01.2005 and the summons was

issued on the same date. Accordingly the case was called on 25.02.2005 and one

P.D. Sugathapala appeared on behalf of the appellant. On that day, the Court

directed him to bring a letter of authorization on next date i.e. 04.03.2005.

Accordingly, the said Sugathapala appeared on 04.03.2005 and on the same day

the charge was read to him, upon which he pleaded not guilty. On the same day,

'-the Learned Magistrate fixed the case for trial on 20.05.2005. However, the

proceeding of the said date is not available in the brief. I observe that date of

16.09.2005 is mentioned as 'Trial (1)". On the said date, the trial was postponed to

11.11.2005, since the PW 01 was not available. On 11.11.2005, the trial was

postponed due to absence of officers for the prosecution (Page 135 of the brief).

Thereafter, on 27.01.2006, the appellant was not present and the trial was fixed for

21.04.2006. On 21.04.2006, again the PW 01 was not available and therefore the

trial was fixed for 16.06.2006. On the said date i.e. 16.06.2006, the appellant raised

the aforesaid preliminary objection on the basis of prescription.

I observe that even though the trial was fixed by the Learned Magistrate, the trial

did not commence and the evidence of the witnesses was not led. Therefore, it is

manifested that the appellant raised his objection pefore the trial commenced. I . , observe that in the case law submitted by the Learned SSC for the respondent,

mostly the appellants raised their jurisdictional objections at the appeal stage and

not in the first Court/original Court. Therefore the appellate Court refused to

uphold such objection since it should be treated as a waiver on the part of the

appellant. However, since the appellant in the instant case raised his objection at

the original Court, especially prior to the commencement of the leading of

Page 7 of9

witnesses, I think this situation should fall. within an 'earliest opportunity' as

described in our law. However, I must mention that this 'earliest opportunity'

could depend on the circumstances of each case.

In the case of Tunnaya alias Gunapala V. Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Galewela (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 61, it was held that,

"Equating a report under Section 116 (1) to an institution of proceedings is

wrong. "

In the said case, the Court took up the view that the statements on the law (obiter)

in the case of Attorney General V. Punchi Banda (1986) 1 Sri L.R 40 (c. A.),

should not be followed. Accordingly in the case of Tunnaya (supra), it was held

that,

" ... and at page 45 of the report ... "once a suspect is taken before the

Magistrate ... on the basis that information is well founded then by virtue ofs.

136 (1) (d) proceedings are instituted and the Magistrate is directed to start

an inquiry under s. 145", are wrong in law and should not befollowed ... "

In light of above and upon perusal of the proceedings, it is understood that the

instant case was instituted after filing of the complaint on 07.01.2005. It is clear

that the period of three months was lapsed as mentioned in section 20 of the Food

Act. Therefore the contention of the Learned President's Counsel for the appellant

should be answered in affirmative. Accordingly I am of the view that both the

Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate erred in overruling the

preliminary objection.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and Others (2004) 1 Sri LR 284, it was

held that:

Page 8 of9

/I ... to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which is beyond

an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly

react to it ... the order complained of is of such a nature which would have

shocked the conscience of the court. /I

Since the error on the part of the Court clearly caused a miscarriage of justice, I am

of the view that this Court needs to invoke the revisionary powers to rectify such

error. Therefore I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

12.09.2006 in case No. HCR 35/2006 and the order of the Learned Magistrate

dated 28.07.2006 in case No. 26570.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby allowed.
