01. 1st and the 2nd Accused Appellants (Appellants) were indicted in the High

Court of Kandy with one count of murder punishable under section 296

of the Penal Code and two counts of causing hurt punishable under

section 315 of the Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court Judge

convicted the Appellants for all 3 counts and were sentenced accordingly.

2

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, Appellants

preferred the instant appeal.

02. Grounds of appeal as urged by the Counsel for the Appellants are;

1. Conviction is wholly unsafe in view of the fact that identification

of the Accused tantamount to dock identification.

2. Following closely on the heels of ground I, learned Trial Judge's

evaluation relating to identification is wholly deficient.

03. Both grounds of appeal are based on the identification of the two Accused

Appellants. Main witnesses the prosecution relied on identification of the

Appellants were, Sunil Jayasundera (PW I) and Kuda Banda Ratnayake

(PW2). Evidence ofPWI was that on the day of the incident, he had gone

with the deceased and PW2 to drink toddy at about 6.30 pm. The place

had been a house that sells toddy. There had been about another 6 to 7

people including 1st Appellant who had come to drink toddy. An

argument had taken place between the 1st Appellant and the deceased

over a cup. The dispute was settled and they had gone back to their

working place. When they were waiting for the watchers to come, 1

51

Appellant had come with the 2nd Appellant and had assaulted the

deceased with poles. When the deceased fell, and when he questioned as

to why they assaulted the deceased, they had assaulted him and PW2 as

well. The time had been about 6.45 pm and there had been thick mist.

With the help of the villagers, the deceased and the injured were taken to

hospital.

04. PW2 also testified at the trial corroborating the evidence of the PW 1 on

the incident. However, it is important to note that the Appellants were not

known to the witnesses before. They have seen the 1

51 Appellant for the

first time at the place where toddy was sold. Then at the crime scene for

3

the second time. As far as the 2nd Appellant is concemed, both PWI and

PW2 had seen him at the crime scene for the first time. No identification

parade was held on the Appellants and both witnesses identified the

Appellants from the dock.

05. It is settled law that it is undesirable and unsafe to convict an Accused

solely on dock identification. (Mun.iratne and Others V. State 20012 Sri

L.R.382.)

06. Witnesses may genuinely believe that the Accused in the dock was the

person who committed the crime, for the reason that the police after

investigation has brought the Accused to Court.

07. In case of Williams (Noel) V. The Queen [1997[ 1 W.L.R.548, it was

said that where a witness volunteers a dock identification, the summing

up should make it plain that such evidence is undesirable; that the proper

practice is to hold a parade; and the evidence should be approached with

great care.

08. In case of Holland V. HM Advocate [2005} UKPC D 1; The Times, 1

June 2005, it was held that permitting a dock identification was not per

se incompatible with the right to a fair trial. Factors to weigh the equation

of whether an Accused had had a fair trial would include whether he was

legally represented, what directions the Judge had given about

identification evidence and the significance of the contested evidence in

the context of the case as a whole.

09. In the instant case, the learned Trial Judge has given careful consideration

on the evidence of identification. As rightly stated in his judgment by the

learned Trial Judge, the I SI Appellant in his statement from the dock has

admitted his presence at the toddy selling place as well as the time of the

incident. He also admitted that he had a quarrel at the toddy selling place

4

over a cup. The 2nd Appellant also admitted his presence at the crime

scene. Hence, the evidence taken as a whole, there cannot be any issue or

doubt about the identification of both Appellants. Therefore, the grounds

of appeal on identification should necessarily fail.

10. Although there was no other ground urged in this appeal, the learned

Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the learned Trial Judge should

have considered lesser culpability on the basis of a sudden fight. Counsel

submitted that there was no pre meditation and that it was a chance

meeting.

11. First Appellant in his dock statement said that after the first incident at

the toddy selling place, he went along the road where he saw the people

whom he had a quarrel before, talking to each other. When he went pass

them, they had assaulted him. He never had any weapon, he said. He had

seen his brother coming to rescue him, where the brother was also

assaulted.

12. Second Appellant said that he saw four to five people assaulting the

brother. When he went there, he was also assaulted. He had assaulted

them with an umbrella.

13. Medical evidence revealed that the deceased had mUltiple injuries caused

by a blunt weapon, that is compatible with the evidence for the

prosecution. Evidence of the police officer who arrested the 1st Appellant

revealed that the 151 Appellant had a bruise in his fingers. As pointed out

by the counsel for the Respondent, it may well be an injury caused to him

when the deceased and the other injured obviously tried to defend

themselves. Although the 1

51 Appellant said in his dock statement that he

did not carry any weapon, the learned Trial Judge had rightly rejected that

evidence in the circumstances. Partial defence of lesser culpability was

5

never put to any of the witnesses for the prosecution when they gave

evidence. It is evident that the Appellants had come armed with clubs to

assault the deceased and the injured. The learned Trial Judge has given

careful consideration to the evidence and rightly decided that the

culpability cannot lessen to an offence under section 297 of the Penal

Code.

In the above premise, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge. Convictions and the sentences imposed

on the Appellants are affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
