.-Decided on 30.05.2019

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. The main argument in this appeal focused on the question whether the identity of

the corpus sought to be partitioned in the case was properly established. Among

many other grounds which the learned District Judge of Gampaha has recited in his

judgment dated 30.11.2000, all Counsel who argued this matter before this Court

concentrated principally on one ground-namely the Plaintiff-Respondent failed to

identify the corpus.

The Plaintiff instituted this action to partition a land called "Lot B of Delogodawalawwe

Watte" which is morefully described to the schedule to the plaint. In fact the plaint

described the property as follows:-

The boundaries referred to in the schedule are given as follows:-

One of the issues raised at the trial on behalf of the IstDefendant-Respondent liyanage

Herath Perera was whether the land referred to in the schedule has been identified by the

preliminary plan bearing No.2435. The learned District Judge of Gampaha by his judgment

dated 30.11.2000 held inter alia that the Plaintiff failed to establish the identity of the

corpus and accordingly the Plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. It is against the

said judgment that the 4(a) Defendant-Appellant has preferred this appeal.

Oral submissions were made in this Court by the two learned President's Counsel for

both the 4( a) Defendant-Appellant and the IA Defendant-Respondent and Mr. Nuwan

Bopage the Junior Counsel for the 4(a) Defendant-Appellant too made some impressive

submissions following his learned Senior Counsel and the Counsel for the Plaintiff-

Respondent who associated with both oral and written submissions of the 4(a)

Defendant-Appellant has filed comprehensive written submissions on the merits of the

case.

In order to arrive at a decision whether the learned District Judge was correct in

dismissing the Plaintiffs' action on the ground of failure to identify the corpus, a

comparison of the boundaries depicted in the deeds, the schedule to the plaint and

preliminary plan becomes relevant. Since the boundaries in the relevant deed (PI) is

reproduced in the schedule to the plaint, I would compare the boundaries in the

schedule to the plaint vis-a.-vis the preliminary plan.

Plaint Preliminary Plan

North ~alavvvvevvatte belonging to R.D. Land novv belonging to Mathes Appu and Thilakaratne and his vvife and Northern others, a Land belonging to Pirivena and Portion of Delgodavvalvvavvatte a land belonging to ~.M. Piyasena

East Land belonging to K. Bastian Appu and Land belonging to K. Bastian Appu and land belonging to Pelavvatte Uyanage land novv belonging to Indrani Alliya Sooriyarachchi and another nevv person

South Paddy filed belonging to Panapitiya Canal and Main Road Kankanamlage Don Aranolis and another nevv person

4

. . -West A road bearing No. lot A and land Delgoda~ Weliweriya main road and a belonging to Monias and another new land now belonging to Mathes Appu and person another new person

As could be seen, the Northern and Southern boundaries given in the plaint vis~a~vis the

preliminary plan do not tally at all and assuming that the Eastern boundaries may tally to

the some extent, the Western boundaries are inconsistent with each other and it was

argued quite vigorously on behalf of the 4(a) Defendant~Appeliant that given the

changing times and development activities taking place all around, boundaries of lands

do change over an effluxion of time and what existed as a paddy filed in the year 1928 on

the southern boundary to the corpus may have become a canal by the time of the

preliminary survey in 1985. I would not gainsay this submission and it is true that

boundaries of land do change over the tide of time.

But one cannot resile from an important aspect of partition law. The land surveyed must

be the land to which the deeds apply. The Plaintiff is only entitled to get a partition

decree of a land to which he is entitled on the deeds. A corpus is identified by reference

to boundaries in the schedule to the deeds. With the passage of time names of

boundaries may differ but the divergence must be explained by a Plaintiff who seeks to

partition a land. Or the change may even be manifested in the preliminary plan.

One cannot conjecture on the change of name of boundaries without some evidence

being led on the change that has occurred. It is precisely because of this imperative duty

to identify the corpus with certainty that Section 18(i)(a)(iii) of the Partition law

requires the surveyor to transmit to court a report, substantially in the form set out in

the Second schedule to the law, verified by affidavit, which states inter alia: "whether or

not the land surveyed by him is in his opinion substantially the same as the land sought

to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint".

Even the form of surveyor's report which is set out in Second schedule to Partition law,

requires the Commissioner to express his opinion in Item No.(v) ''whether or not the land

5

surveyed is substantially the same as the land sought to be partitioned as described in the schedule to the

plaint".

In order for the Commissioners to comply with the above statutory duty, Section 16(2) of

the Partition Law provides:,

"The Commission issued to a surveyor under subsection (1) of this section shall be substantially in

the form set out in the Second Schedule to this Law and shall have attached thereto a copy of the

plaint certified as a true copy by the registered attorney for the Plaintiff .......... "

The legislative intent of Section 16 to compel the mandatory attachment of a copy of the

plaint with commission papers is aimed at facilitating the commissioner to identify the

corpus depicted in the plaint with existing physical boundaries and metes and the

opinion of the Surveyor has to be mandatorily in the form of surveyor's report as given in

the Second Schedule and a mere mention of the name of the land on the plan as in the

plaint is not a due compliance with the imperative requirement of Section 18(1)(a)(iii).

In fact in Sopaya Silva v. Magilin Silva (1989) 2 Sri LR 105, S.N. Silva, J. (as His

Lordship then was with Abeywira, J. agreeing) held that the surveyor under Section

18(l)(a)(iii) must in his report state whether or not the land surveyed by him is

substantially the same as described in the schedule to the plaint. Considering the finality

and conclusiveness that attach in terms of Section 48(1) of the Partition Law to the

decree in a partition action, the Court should insist upon its compliance with this

requirement by the surveyor.

The necessity to seek further directions from Court was emphasized by Court in Brampy

Appuhamy v. Menis Appuhamy60 N.LR 337.

If the land surveyed is substantially different from the land as described in the schedule

to the plaint, the Court has to decide at that stage whether to issue instructions to the

surveyor to carry out a fresh survey in conformity with the commission or whether the

action should be proceeded with in respect of the land as surveyed.

6

. II"

If one peruses the report of the surveyor at p.443 of the appeal brief, it is wanting in this

material particular~namely the corpus surveyed is substantially the same as depicted in

the plaint. As a result I would hold that the surveyor's report would be devoid of

evidential value as it lacks a material particular.

There are other precedents which have reiterated the imperative nature of the surveyor's

duty in a number of cases.

In Hengada Vithanachchi Sumanasena v. G.K Premaratna (CA 1336~1337/99F) D.c.

Galle 7028/P decided on 06.03.2014, A.W.A. Salam, J. (with Sunil Rajapaksha, ].

agreeing) held as follows: ~

"The significance of complying with section 16 of the Partition Law cannot be lightly disregarded

or undervalued. Amongst other directions a commission issued under section 16 includes a

command on the surveyor to survey the land to which the action relates and section 18 (1) (a) (iii)

requires him to express an opinion in his report by way of an affidavit as to whether or not the

land surveyed is considerably the same as the land sought to be partition as described in the

schedule to the plaint. Taking into account the far~reaching consequences of the final decree

entered in a partition action and the extent to which it binds the whole world, the Court should, so

long as it is not impracticable, insist on the compliance of Section 16(2)."

Partition Law stands in a class sui generis and there are specific provisions that apply to

partition suits alone. If the surveyor's report is in conformity with Section 18(l)(a), then

Section 18(2) is to the effect that the report may be adduced in evidence without further

proof in order to establish the facts stated in the report as evidence.

There was definitely an abdication of a mandatory duty on the part of the surveyor but

though I will not go to the extent of holding that then on~compliance with Section 18 is

not per se a ground to vitiate a decree, I take the view that if the preliminary plan and

report are returned to Court without coming with Section 18(2) of the Partition Law,

such noncompliance deprives the report of its evidentiary value as to identification of

corpus and the Plaintiff has to resort to evidence aliunde to establish that what was

7

,

surveyed was what had been depicted in the schedule to the plaint. The importance of

proof of identity becomes more pronounced if a specific issue has been raised as regards

the identity of the corpus. If there is divergence of descriptions between the deeds and

the preliminary plan as to identity of the corpus, the Plaintiff must offer evidence to

explain the divergence and this evidence can even take the form of summoning the

surveyor to give evidence. None of the above has happened in the case-also see Sopaya

Silva v. Magilin Silva (1989) 2 Sri LR 105 at 108.

If one peruses the evidence of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff too does not explain nor does he

utter anything about the boundaries. There is no independent evidence flowing from the

Plaintiff to establish the identity of the corpus.

If one looks at the title deed of the plaintiff marked at the trial as PI, one would observe

in the schedule a description of an amalgamated land called "Delgodawatta" in an extent of

36 acres. It also refers to "Lot No. B" of the said Delgodawatta as depicted in Plan bearing

No.398 which is in an extent of 21 acres, 25 perches x 68/100. This shows that the

Plaintiff was describing a part of the corpus. In other words it would appear that the

plaintiff was seeking to partition a part of a larger land. Even in his testimony the

Plaintiff admitted that he was seeking to partition on the part of the corpus-see page 137.

It is axiomatic that a party cannot seek to secure a partition decree for a part of a larger

land.

In the circumstances the learned District Judge reached the correct finding in holding

that the corpus to be partitioned has not been correctly identified and I see no reason to

disturb this finding. Accordingly I affirm the judgment of the learned Additional District

Judge of Gampaha dated 30.11.2000 and dismiss this appeal.
