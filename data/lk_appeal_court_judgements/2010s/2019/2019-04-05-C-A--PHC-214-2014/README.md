Argued on: 02.04.2019

Decided on: 05.04.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The first information was filed by the police before the

Magistrates Court under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, No.44 of 1979, making the 1st party respondent

and the 2nd and 3rd party appellants parties to the matter on the

basis that there was an imminent threat to the breach of the

peace among the parties over possession of a portion of a land.

There is no dispute about the identification of the said portion.

The contest was between the 1st party respondent (respondent)

and the 2nd party appellant (appellant). It is inconceivable why

the 3rd party also appealed and actively participated in the

appeal because he sought no relief from the Magistrates Court.1

After inquiry, the learned Magistrate, in terms of section 68(1),

held with the appellant on the basis that it was the appellant

who was admittedly in possession of the portion of the land on

the date the first information was filed in Court, and the

respondent, in terms of section 68(3), had not proved

dispossession within two months prior to the filing the said

information.

This order was set aside by the High Court in revision, and held

with the respondent. This appeal is from the Judgment of the

High Court.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, the Judgment of the

High Court is correct.

The respondent complained to the police on 09.11.2011 about

forcible dispossession of him from the portion of land in dispute

by the appellant on the same day.2 Soon after the complaint

was made, a police officer has visited the scene and made

notes.3 From those notes it is quite clear that the respondent

had been in possession of this portion of land until he was

dispossessed by the appellant on that day. This portion of land

is just behind the eatery of the respondent, and according to the

said police notes, that part had been using by the respondent to

dispose waste.4 The fact that the respondent had been in

possession of this portion of land is further confirmed by the

inspection notes made by a former Magistrate in respect of

another section 66 application in respect of the same portion of

land with another party marked 1V20.5

According to paragraph 4 of the affidavit filed by the appellant

before the Magistrates Court, he has taken possession of the

adjoining premises (house) from one Hapangama on

2 Vide page 304 of the brief. 3 Vide page 305 of the brief. 4 Vide lines 9-11 from bottom of page 305 of the brief. 5 Vide pages 365-370 of the brief.

14.11.2011.6 That means, if at all he has come into possession

of the disputed portion of the land, he has done so only one

week before the filing of the first information. He has not had

any possession before that date.

The police officer who visited the scene on 09.11.2011 has

clearly stated that the house which the appellant is alleged to

have bought from Hapangama was an abandoned house, which

has not been used for a long time by anybody.7 That means,

Hapangama had not been in possession of the disputed portion

of the land before.

For the aforesaid reasons, it is clear that the respondent had

been forcibly dispossessed from the disputed portion of the land

by the appellant within two months immediately before the filing

of the first information in Court, and therefore the respondent

was entitled to be restored in possession in terms of section

68(3) of the Act.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
