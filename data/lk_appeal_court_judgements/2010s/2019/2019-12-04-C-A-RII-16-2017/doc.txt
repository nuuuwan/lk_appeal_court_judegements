Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application for revision and restitutio in

integrum seeking to set aside the order nisi and order absolute

made by the District Court marked A and B respectively.

After order nisi was served on the petitioners, they filed

objections against it being made absolute, and, thereafter, the

District Court, after an inquiry, made the order nisi absolute by

order dated 27.03.2014.

There is no basis to seek to set aside an order nisi (as opposed to

order absolute) entered in terms of section 16 of the Recovery of

Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, as

amended, because the affected party is given an opportunity to

show cause against it being made absolute, which has been

afforded in this case as well.

In paragraph 6 of the petition, the petitioners state that the

order absolute was made by order dated 27th July 2014. I find

no such order made on 27th July 2014. The order absolute has

been made on 27th March 2014.

The petitioners seem to be filing cases irresponsibly to buy time,

thereby postponing payments due to the Bank.

Against the order absolute made by the District Judge, the

petitioners have filed a final appeal (instead of leave to appeal) in

the High Court of Civil Appeal, in my view, to mark time.

The High Court has dismissed that appeal by Judgment dated

13.07.2017 marked F on the ground that no appeal lies

against the said order absolute.

The petitioners in paragraph 10 of the petition state that The

petitioners did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as

the petitioners were not entitled to appeal under the Act No.4 of

1990. This is another misleading statement.

The petitioners are not entitled to appeal against the Judgment

of the High Court of Civil Appeal not under the Act No.4 of

1990, but under section 5C of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No.54 of 2006, which

requires special leave to be obtained from the Supreme Court in

order to appeal against a Judgment of the High Court of Civil

Appeal. No step has been taken by the petitioners to seek

special leave to appeal against the said Judgment of the High

Court of Civil Appeal.

Hence, the argument of the petitioners in paragraph 11 of the

petition that Since the petitioners are without any legal remedy,

the petitioners are entitled to make this application in this Court

is baseless.

The petitioners whole application, in my view, is tainted with

mala fides. They have not come before this Court with clean

hands. Therefore, they are not entitled to the discretionary

remedy by way of revision or restitutio in integrum.

I dismiss the application with costs.
