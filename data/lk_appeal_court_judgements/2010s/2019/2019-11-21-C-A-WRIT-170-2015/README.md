Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari the decision of the Commissioner of Labour

marked X21, made in terms of the provisions of the Termination

of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of

1971, as amended, whereby the petitioner employer was directed

to pay the 4th respondent employee a sum of Rs. 1,230,000/= as

compensation for the termination of services of .the latter.

The learned counsel for the petitioner challenges the said

decision on several grounds.

One such ground is that the Commissioner of Labour made that

decision without giving a fair hearing to the petitioner. There is

force in that argument.

By tendering the proceedings before the Commissioner of Labour

dated 15.09.2014 marked XIO, the learned counsel for the

petitioner states that, the petitioner never agreed to dispose of

the inquiry by way of written submissions only, and parties

agreed to file written submissions only in the first instance, and

not in lieu of oral evidence and/or oral submissions. When one

reads the concluding remarks of the inquiring officer on that

date, what the learned counsel says is acceptable. It reads as

follows:

The 1 s'-3rd respondents m paragraph 15 of the statement of

objections admits XI0, but state that the parties agreed to

dispose of the inquiry by way of written submissions. In support

of that contention, they tender a copy of the attendance register

of the said date as 1R3. That paragraph reads as follows:

Answering the averments contained in paragraph 16 of the

petition, the respondents admit the document marked X10

and state that as no settlement was possible when the

matter was called on 15 September 2014 it was agreed

that the matter would be disposed of by way of written

submissions and the matter was fixed for the written

submissions of the employee on 7 October 2014 and written

submissions of the employer on 21 October 2014. A true

copy of the attendance register of the said date is annexed

herewith marked 1R3 pleaded as part and parcel hereof

It is not clear how the respondents state that the parties agreed

to dispose of the inquiry only by way of written submissions

when it appears from the above quoted proceedings of

15.09.2014 that the intention of the parties was to tender

4

written submissions only as the fIrst step as contended by the

learned counsel for the petitioner.

The attendance register marked 1R3 as "a copy of the

attendance register of the said date", where there is an

endorsement to say that the parties agreed to dispose of the

inquiry by way of written submissions, is not relevant to

15.09.2015. It is relevant to 16.09.2015. 16.09.2015 cannot be

a mistake, because the same date appears both on the top and

at the end, below the signature of that document. That

endorsement reads as follows:

",~,,,~,,,E),,, '1'",6 o@)cj",2Si @""@)l"l @11'J,,; "B"",,~,,, BOl", o,2SiQ @)~,,;

~"''''''' 1'J@)0 ",~",~",E)", 6::;)", ~ '1'",6 BOl", o,2SiQ 2014.1 0.07 ~"., "',

6",o g"l BOl", "'t;"''''' 2014.1 0.22 ~"., e@' ~@)o ",~",~",E)",@) 6::;)",

I'J", .

It is the position of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

said endorsement is an afterthought/subsequent addition.

I do not say that 1R3 is a forged document. But it is a

suspicious document.

According to 1R2, the proceedings dated 27.08.2014, the inquiry

has been postponed from 27.08.2014 to 15.09.2014.

The proceedings of 15.09.2014 have been marked as X10, which

has been admitted by the respondents. According to X10,

written submissions shall be tendered on 07.10.2014, and the

reply submissions on 21.10.2014.

But according to IR3 dated 16.09.2014, written submissions

shall be tendered on 07.10.2014, and the reply submissions on

22.10.2014 (and not on 2l.10.2014). It is not clear how,

\

according to 1R3, the inquiry was taken up on 16.09.2014,

when, according to X10, the inquiry was held on 15.09.2014.

It appears that there had been at least a confusion regarding the

inquiry dates and how the inquiry shall be disposed of.

For the aforesaid reasons, I accept the argument of the learned

counsel for the petitioner that the impugned decision was taken

without giving a fair hearing or in violation of the petitioner's

legitimate expectation to have a fair inquiry into the matter.

Accordingly, I quash the impugned decision marked X21 by

certiorari and direct the 1 st respondent to refIx the matter for

further inquiry and then take a fresh decision according to law.

This does not mean that the respondent shall necessarily come

to a different conclusion.

In view of the said conclusion, the necessity does not arlse to

consider the other arguments taken by the learned counsel for

the petitioner.

Application of the petitioner is allowed. No costs .
