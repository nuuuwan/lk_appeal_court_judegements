K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Aggrieved Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North

Western Province holden in Kuliyapitiya dated 11.02.2015 in Case No. HCR

67/2012 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned

Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya dated 16.04.2012 in Case No. 71436. At the stage of

argument, all parties agreed to dispose this case by way of written submissions and

to abide by the same. I observe that in the written submissions of the 1 st and 2nd

Respondents-Respondents, the title is typed as 'Written Submission of the Third

Respondent'. However, the contents of the written submissions refer to the' 1 st and

2nd respondents'. Therefore, I ignore the said title since it appears to be a

typographical error.

Facts of the case:

The accused persons were charged in the Magistrate's Court of Kuliyapitiya for

committing offences punishable under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

Ordinance No. 13 of 1907 and the Animals Act No. 29 of 1958, by transporting 07

cattle without a permit. The accused persons pleaded guilty to charges and were

convicted and sentenced accordingly. Thereafter a vehicle claim inquiry was held

with regard to the Lorry bearing No. WPLL --: 1487 that was used for the

commission of the offence. In the vehicle claim inquiry, the aggrieved petitioner-

appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') and the 3rd respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the '3 rd respondent') gave evidence. At the

conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya confiscated the

vehicle.

Page 4 of 10

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in

Kuliyapitiya. The Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned

Magistrate and dismissed the revision application.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The order of the Learned Magistrate is contrary to law and against the

weight of the evidence.

"-2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the

evidence given at the vehicle inquiry has to be evaluated on a balance

of probability.

In terms of the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act, an order for confiscation

shall not be made if the owner of the vehicle proves to the satisfaction of Court,

that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle or that the

vehicle had been used without his knowledge for the commission of the offence.

This was elaborated in the case law as follows;

In the case of Faris V. The Officer ID charge, Police Station,

Galenbindunuwewa and another (1992) 1 Sri L.R. 167, it was held that,

"In terms of the proviso to Section 3A of the Animals Act, an order for

confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of two matters.

They are: (1) That he ' has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the

vehicle for the commission of the offence. (2) That the vehicle has been used

for the commission of the offence without his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes anyone of these matters on

a balance of probability, an order for confiscation should not be made ... "

In the case ofNizar V. I.P, Wattegama (1978-79) 2 SLR 304, it was held that,

Page 5 of 10

"In J 968 two new sub-sections were qdded to section 3 of the Act by Act

No. 20 of 1968. One of them is asfollows;

"3A. Where a person is convicted of an offence under this part or any

regulations made thee under, any vehicle used in the commission of

the offence shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed for

such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate to

confiscation:

Provided however, that in any case where the owner of the

vehicle is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made, if the

owner proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of vehicle or that the vehicle has been

used without his knowledge for the commission of the offence ... "

.. .In all these Ordinances and Regulations there was no proviso similar to

the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act and the decisions in all the

cases turned on an interpretation of the sections in which the words used "

be liable to confiscation " is identical with the words of section 3A. It was

held in all these cases that no order of confiscation should be made without

giving the owner an opportunity of showing cause and that if he succeeded

in showing that he had taken all precautions against the use of the vehicle

for the commission of the offence and that he was not in any way a privy to

the commission of the offence then the vehicle ought not to be confiscated. "

In the case of Umma Habeeba V. Ole, Dehiattakandiya and other (1999) 3

Sri.L.R. 89, it was held that,

"What s. 3A means is that the vehicle shall necessarily be confiscated if the

owner fails to prove that the offence was committed without the knowledge

Page 6 of 10

but not otherwise. If, as contended, the Magistrate was given a discretion to consider whether to confiscate or not - the Magistrate could confiscate even

when the offence was committed without the knowledge of the owner taking

into consideration other damnable circumstances apart from knowledge or

lack of it on the part of the owner". "

Therefore, it is understood that a vehicle owner in question is required to prove one

of the above two requirements, on a balance of probability.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the Learned Magistrate

simply had relied on slight contradictions in the evidence of the appellant to infer

the knowledge on the part of the appellant and the Learned High Court Judge

overlooked the said error committed by the Learned Magistrate.

It was further argued that the Learned Magistrate had neglected the fact that the

said motor lorry was hired to one Ananda for transporting of rice once a week and

it is difficult for the appellant to remember the exact number of occasions the lorry

has travelled to Polonnaruwa.

However, I observe that the appellant in her evidence had not mentioned any

specific precaution taken by her to prevent an offence being committed using her

vehicle. Therefore, the only consideration for the Learned Magistrate was to

evaluate whether the appellant had no knowledge of an offence being committed.

The appellant testified that she gave the lorry for a hire as requested by one . . . Ananda on 2l.l0.2011 , whereas the vehicle was arrested on 22.10.2011. The

appellant testified that the Lorry was being travelled to Polonnaruwa every week.

However, answering a question of the Court, she took up the position that the lorry

was taken to Polonnaruwa only 3 times and again she changed her position stating

that it was taken three times a week. Accordingly, the Learned Magistrate was of

the view that the appellant was not a credible witness and therefore the Court

Page 7 of 10

cannot rely on her evidence. Therefore, I am qf the view that this Court should not

interfere with the finding of the Learned Magistrate by way of revision, when there

is no manifested error or irregularity in the said finding. Therefore, both grounds of

appeal of the appellant should fail.

The 3rd respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') was the absolute

owner of the motor lorry. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent submitted

that the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in law by coming to the

conclusion that the absolute owner has no right to claim the vehicle in a vehicle

'-inquiry before a Magistrate's Court and the only claim an absolute owner can make

is before a District Court based on the agreement. The Learned counsel for the 3rd

respondent stated that their submissions are for the limited purpose of rectifying

the above error made by the Learned High Court Judge, in order to safeguard the

rights of an absolute owner in a vehicle claim inquiry.

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge in his order, referred to the case of

Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest Officer of

Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], and took the view that an

absolute owner can file a civil action in the District Court since an absolute owner

does not have possession of such vehicle.

I observe that the Supreme Court, in the case of Orient Financial Services

(supra), recognized the rights of an absolute owner in a vehicle inquiry, such as

the right to claim the vehicle, right to be heard in the inquiry and the right to

receive the vehicle if it is not confiscated by the Court. In the said case, the

Supreme Court was of the view that the absolute owner will have the same burden

of proof as the registered owner if the absolute owner claims the vehicle and

therefore the absolute owner should prove on a balance of probability that he

fulfilled the requirements as stated in the relevant statutory provisions. I observe

that the Learned High Court Judge, in the instant case, has correctly observed the

Page 8 of 10

aforesaid Supreme Court decision and the J.,earned High Court Judge did not

exclude the right of an absolute owner in a vehicle inquiry, as submitted by the 3rd

respondent. Therefore I do not see any error on the part of the Learned High Court

Judge, which this Court needs to rectify.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the ~traordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every

litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to

make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of

appeal ... " (Emphasis added)

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 284, it was

held that,

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court." .

In light of above, it is understood that this Court shall invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction only if there has been an error, irregularity, illegality in the order

challenged or there has been a miscarriage of justice which amounts to exceptional

circumstances. Since the appellant has not demonstrated any exceptional

Page 9 of 10

circumstances to the satisfaction of this COUl}, I do not wish to interfere with the

order of the Learned Magistrate dated 16.04.2012 in Case No. 71436 and the order

of the Learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya dated 11.02.2015 in Case No.

HCR 67/2012. Therefore I affirm the same.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby dismissed.
