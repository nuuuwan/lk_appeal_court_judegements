Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is a case stated for the opinion of this Court under section

11A of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, as

amended.

In terms of section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, the

respondent taxpayer preferred an appeal to the Tax Appeals

Commission against the determination of the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue dated 10.11.2014.

The Tax Appeals Commission, by determination dated

13.11.2015, without going into the merits of the matter, allowed

the appeal on the basis that the Notice of Assessment relevant to

this matter is not in compliance with the mandatory provisions

of section 60(1) of the Value Added Tax Act, No.14 of 2002, as

amended, inasmuch as the said Notice of Assessment does not

bear the name of the Commissioner General, Deputy

Commissioner or Assessor issuing it nor any name duly printed

or signed thereon. The Tax Appeals Commission has also taken

the view that the omission is not a defect curable under section

61 of the VAT Act.

There is no dispute that the Notice of Assessment does not bear

the name of the Commissioner General nor any name duly

printed or signed thereon.

It is the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel for the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue that as the Notice of

Assessment is a computer-generated document, under the

Website Copy Website Copy

3

Electronic Transactions Act, No.19 of 2006, as amended, neither

the name nor the signature is required.

Secondly, the learned Senior State Counsel submits that even if

the Notice of Assessment is not considered a computer-

generated document, the failure to place the name or signature

of the Assessor who issued the Notice is an omission that could

be cured by section 61(1) of the Value Added Tax Act.

I will first consider the alternative submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel.

By looking at, inter alia, page (ii) of the Petition of Appeal of the

respondent taxpayer, it is clear that the respondent taxpayer

knew very well that the Assessor responsible for this Assessment

is Mrs. S.H.C.S. Perera of Unit 5 of the Department of Inland

Revenue. The respondent taxpayer has given details of the

inquiry/interview had with the said Assessor and the documents

exchanged in that regard prior to the receipt of the Notice of

Assessment.

It is noteworthy that in all the correspondence (including the

documents exchanged before the receipt of the Notice of

Assessment1 and in the Notice of Assessment in issue), the

following details are included:

Tax Identification No./File No. 114470058

Assessment No. 6976840

Taxable Period 09090

1 Vide the intimation letter sent by the said Assessor to the respondent taxpayer dated 16.07.2012, the Notice of Disagreement by the respondent taxpayer to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue dated 22.08.2014

Website Copy Website Copy

According to page 1 of the Reasons for the Determination of

Appeal given by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

dated 10.11.2014, during the hearing of the appeal before the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, the said Assessor,

Mrs. S.H.C.S. Perera, also participated.

Hence, there was no room for the respondent taxpayer to be

misled about the item of tax in dispute and the name of the

Assessor who made the Assessment.

There is no issue that the respondent taxpayer received the

Notice of Assessment.

Section 60(1) of the Value Added Tax Act (as amended by Act No.

7 of 20142) reads as follows:

Every notice to be given by the Commissioner General, a

Commissioner or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner

under this Act shall bear the name of the Commissioner

General or Commissioner or Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner as the case may be and every such notice

shall be valid if the name of the Commissioner General,

Commissioner or Assessor or Assistant Commissioner is duly

printed or signed thereon.

The Tax Appeals Commission has taken the view that the use of

the word shall in section 60(1) makes compliance mandatory,

and there is no valid assessment without the name or signature.

2 Vide section 13 of the Amended Act.

The learned counsel for the respondent taxpayer, in his written

submission, whilst emphasising the use of the word shall twice

in section 60(1) and the use of the word if in the said section,

argues that a notice is valid only if it bears the name either

printed or signed thereon.

In Elgitread Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. v. Bino Tyres (Pvt) Ltd3, Marsoof J.

stated:

The may and shall dichotomy has oft confounded courts

in the process of statutory interpretation, and as N.S.

Bindras Interpretation of Statutes (10th Edition,

Butterworths, 2007) explains at page 999-

The use of the expression may or shall in a statute is not

decisive, and other relevant provisions that can throw light

have to be looked into in order to find out whether the

character of the provision is mandatory or directory. In such

a case legislative intent has to be determined. The words

may, shall, must and the like, as employed in statutes,

will in cases of doubt, require examination in their particular

context in order to ascertain their real meaning.

In ascertaining the legislative intent, it is permissible to look

at the purpose of the legislation in which the particular

provision sought to be interpreted occurs.

As Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) stated in Ramalingam v.

Thangarajah:4

3 [2011] BLR 130 at 136 4 [1982] 2 Sri LR 693 at 702

Prima facie the word shall suggests that it is mandatory,

but that word has often been rightly construed as directory.

Everything turns on the context in which it is used; and the

purpose and effect of the section in which it appears.

In the Supreme Court case of Kamkaru Sevana v. Kingsly

Perera5 Sripavan J. (later C.J.) stated:

It is no doubt true that the rule of interpretation permits the

interpretation of the word may in certain context as

shall and vice versa, namely, permit the interpretation of

shall as may.

In my view, when section 60 is read with section 61, it is clear

that the word shall used in section 60(1) is not mandatory.

Let me reproduce section 60 in its entirety.

60(1) Every notice to be given by the Commissioner General

a Commissioner or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner

under this Act shall bear the name of the Commissioner

General or Commissioner or Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner as the case may be and every such notice

shall be valid if the name of the Commissioner General,

Commissioner or Assessor or Assistant Commissioner is

duly printed or signed thereon.

(2) Every notice given by virtue of this Act may be served on

a person either personally or by being delivered at or sent

by post to his last known place of abode or any place at

5 SC HC LA 86/12, SCM of 17.05.2013

Website Copy Website Copy

which he is, or during the period to which the notice relates,

was carrying on or carrying out a taxable activity.

(3) Any notice sent by post shall be deemed to have been

served on the day on which it could have been received in

the ordinary course of post.

(4) In proving service by post it shall be sufficient to prove

that the letter containing the notice was duly addressed

and posted.

(5) Every name printed or signed on any notice or signed on

any certificate given or issued for the purposes of this Act,

which purports to be the name the person authorised to give

or issue the same, shall be judicially noticed.

When section 60 is read as a whole, it is clear that the intention

of the legislature is to interpret Notice in favour of the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (and not in favour of

the taxpayer).

When section 60(1) is taken separately, the said intention of the

legislature is clearer.

Section 60(1) has two parts. The first part states that the Notice

of Assessment shall bear the name of the Commissioner or the

Assessor. The second part states that even in the absence of the

name, the Notice of Assessment would still be valid if the name

is printed or the Notice is signed.

The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent

taxpayer that The word if is immediately preceded by the

Website Copy Website Copy

8

words shall be valid. This demonstrates that a notice would be

valid if it bears the name either printed or signed, is misplaced.

The second part containing the word if is not favourable to the

taxpayer. It is against the taxpayer. The said second part has

been introduced not to reject Notices but to accept Notices. The

underlying rule employed therein is not exclusionary but

inclusionary.

Against that background, let me now quote section 61 in full.

61(1) No notice, assessment, certificate or other proceeding

purporting to be in accordance with the provisions of this

Act shall be quashed, or deemed to be void or voidable, for

want of form, or be effected by reason of a mistake, defect

or omission therein, if the same is in substance and effect in

conformity with, or according to, the intent and meaning of

this Act, and if the person assessed or intended to be

assessed or affected thereby is designated therein

according to common intent and understanding.

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) an

assessment shall not be affected or impugned by reason of

(a) a mistake therein as to the name or surname of

person chargeable, the amount of the value of taxable

supplies or the amount of tax charged; or

(b) any variance between the assessment and the

notice therefor

Website Copy Website Copy

9

if notice of such assessment is duly served on the person

intended to be charged and contains in substance and

effect the particulars set out in paragraph (a) of this

subsection.

It is manifest that the legislature has employed the inclusionary

rule as opposed to the exclusionary rule in introducing this

section as well. According to this section, even if the Notice of

Assessment is lacking in form or is effected by reason of

mistake, defect or omission therein, if it is, in substance, in

conformity with the intent and meaning of the Act, the Notice

shall not be invalidated. Such defects are curable.

There cannot be any dispute that, if not for the failure to

mention the name of the Assessor, the Notice of Assessment in

question is in conformity with the Act in form.

Having regard to the attended circumstances of this matter

mentioned above, in that no prejudice has been caused to the

respondent taxpayer by failure to mention the name of the

Assessor, it is my considered view that the said failure on the

part of the Assessor shall not make the Notice of Assessment

invalid in view of section 61(1) of the Act. The said defect is a

curable defect.

The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent

taxpayer that For the provisions of section 61(1) to apply, the

notice or assessment ought to first comply with the provisions of

[section 60(1) of] this Act is again misplaced. If section 60(1) has

been fully complied with, there is no reason to seek shelter

under section 61(1).

Another argument of the learned counsel for the respondent

taxpayer is that the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to hear

and determine the questions of law contained in the case stated,

since the impugned determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission does not relate an assessment of the quantum of

tax imposed.

The learned counsel refers to section 11A(6) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act in that regard. This section runs as follows:

Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear

and determine any question of law arising on the stated

case and may in accordance with the decision of Court

upon such question, confirm, reduce, increase or annul the

assessment determined by the Commission, or may remit

the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court,

thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the

Commission shall revise the assessment in accordance with

the opinion of the Court.

It is the contention of the learned counsel that the Court of

Appeal is vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine

questions pertaining to the assessment determined by the

Commission, and, in this case, the Tax Appeals Commission

did not make any determination relating to the assessment,

but invalidated the Notice of Assessment on a technical ground.

In the Supreme Court case of Somawathi de Zoysa v. Jayasena

Fernando6, Weerasuriya J remarked:

6 [2005] 1 Sri LR 10 at 14

Website Copy Website Copy

11

The provisions of a statute must be construed with

reference to their context and with due regard to the object

to be achieved and the mischief to be prevented. Where two

views are possible an interpretation which would advance

the remedy and suppress the mischief it contemplates is to

be preferred.

The very argument of the learned counsel for the respondent

taxpayer is counterproductive. It opens the door for a

constructive dialogue about whether the Tax Appeals

Commission has the authority to declare Notices sent by the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue void purely on

technical grounds, or whether it can only annul an Assessment

determined by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue on

merits. The dicta in cases such as Ismail v. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue7, Ranaweera v. Ramachandran8 seem to me to

be lending support for the latter view. However, I will leave that

broader question open for decision in a future case, and, for the

purposes of this case, decide that the Tax Appeals Commission

had jurisdiction to do what it did.

It will be a travesty of justice if this Court is to hold that if the

Commissioners assessment is reduced by the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Commissioner can appeal to the Court of

Appeal, but if the Commissioners assessment is quashed by the

Tax Appeals Commission, the Commissioner cannot appeal

against such order.

I reject that argument unhesitatingly. 7 [1981] 2 Sri LR 78 at 111 8 (1969) Vol III Sri Lanka Tax Cases 395

In terms of section 11A(6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act,

the Court of Appeal can determine any question of law arising

on the stated case and can remit the case to the Commission

with the opinion of the Court thereon.

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that, in the facts and

circumstances of this case, the Tax Appeals Commission erred

in law when it decided to allow the appeal of the respondent

taxpayer, on the ground that the Notice of Assessment is invalid

as it bears neither the name nor the signature of the Assessor,

as mandated by section 60(1) of the Value Added Tax Act.

In view of the said conclusion, there is no necessity to address

the other questions of law in the case stated.

I direct the Tax Appeals Commission to accept the Notice of

Assessment and decide the appeal on merits.

The appellant is entitled to the costs of this appeal.
