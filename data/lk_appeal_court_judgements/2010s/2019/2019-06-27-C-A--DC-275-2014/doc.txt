WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS FILED ON

JUDGMENT ON

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

29.05.2019 by the Plaintiff Petitioner. 31.05.2019 by the 9th, 11 th, and 13th _18th

Defendants Respondents

27.06.2019

01. The Plaintiff instituted the above partition action in the District Court of

Kalutara to partition the land called 'Hewawatta alias Mahawatte' among the

Plaintiff and 1 st to 18th Defendants. On the commission issued by the learned

District Judge Kalutara, licensed surveyor W. Seneviratne upon surveying

the land, prepared the preliminary plan No.2948. After trial, on 08.05.1985

the learned District Judge delivered the judgment and, on the commission

issued by the learned District Judge, the final plan No.6622 was prepared by

licensed surveyor A.G.C. Sirisoma.

02. The substituted plaintiff, for the given reasons objected to the final plan No.

6622 and the Court fixed the case for scheme inquiry. The substituted

Plaintiff submitted the alternative plan No. 5/2007, and after having heard

the counsel for the substituted Plaintiff, the learned District Judge on

14.05.2007 made order on the commissioner Sirisoma to amend the final

plan as suggested in the alternative plan No. 5/2007. The Defendants were

not present although that day was fixed for scheme inquiry or settlement.

03. Commissioner Sirisoma returned the commission stating that he was unwell

and therefore, the commission was issued to licensed surveyor L. W. Perera

4

to comply with the order dated 14.05.2007. Accordingly, commISSIOner

Perera submitted the final plan No. 2409. 10th Defendant objected to the plan

for the reasons stated and it was fixed for inquiry by way of written

submissions for 09.03.2011. On that day counsel appeared for the 10th

Defendant and the Plaintiff. According to the proceedings on 09.03.2011 on

the objections filed by the 10th Defendant, Plaintiff and 9th, 10th and 11th

Defendants came to a settlement on their respective lots and agreed to accept

the original final plan No. 6622 of commissioner Sirisoma. Learned District

Judge ordered to enter the final decree accordingly.

04. Being aggrieved by the said order the substituted Plaintiff Petitioner (the

Petitioner) preferred this application for relief by way of restitutio in

integrum seeking to set aside the order of the learned District Judge dated

09.03.2011, to set aside the final decree entered, to set aside all other steps

taken after 09.03.2011 and for an order to approve the final plan 2409 of

licensed surveyor L.W.Perera, subject to the insertion of the name of the 10th

Defendant in place of 9th Defendant in respect of lot 02 in the said plan and

inserting the name of the 9th Defendant in place of the 10th Defendant in

respect of lot Olin the same plan. 10th Defendant Respondent filed

objections to the above application.

05. I carefully considered the application of the Petitioner, objections made by

the 10th Defendant, submissions made by the Petitioner, 9th, 11th, and 13th _

18th Defendants Respondents and the submissions made by counsel at the

argument.

06. The remedy of restitutio in integrum cannot, unlike an appeal, be claimed by

a party as of right. Power of this court to grant such relief is a matter of

grace and discretion. (Usoof V. Nadarajah Chettiar, 61 N.L.R. 173). It is a

5

'

remedy which is granted under exceptional circumstances and the power of

Court should be most cautiously and sparingly exercised. (Perera V.

Wijewikrema 15 N.L.R. 411). Party seeking restitution must act with utmost

promptitude. (BabunAppu V. Simon Appu 11 N.L.R. 115).

07. In case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. V. Shanmugam and

Another {1995J 1 Sri L.R. page 55, citing the above line of authorities held;

" . .. It is an extra ordinary remedy and will be granted under

exceptional circumstances. The remedy can be availed of only by one

who is actually a party to the legal proceeding. He cannot claim

damages but he should have suffered damages. A party seeking

restitution must act with the utmost promptitude. The Court will not

relieve parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence or

laches.

08. 9th, 11th, 13th to 18th and the 7th Defendants Respondents made submissions

agreeing with the Plaintiff Petitioner and, the 10th Defendant Respondent has

filed objections to this application.

09. Contention of the Petitioner is that the learned District Judge could not have

accepted plan 6622 as the final plan. The case was called on 09.03.2011 for

a different purpose, that is to consider objections to plan 2409. Except

Petitioner and the 10th Respondent, all other parties who have the rights from

the corpus were absent on 09.03.2011.

10. Counsel for 9th, 11 th, 13th_18th Respondents filing written submissions on

behalf of them on 31 st May 2019, in paragraph 32 submitted that the

Petitioner has already agreed to withdraw the affidavit marked as 'A' along

with the petition given by 9th Defendant by misunderstanding of the correct

6

, .

facts of the case. This shows that the 9th Respondent now sailing with the

other above-mentioned Respondents, is changing his stance, according to the

counsel.

11. Attention of this Court is drawn by the counsel for the Petitioner to the case

of Thevchanamoorthy V. Appakuddy, reported in 51 N.L.R. at page 317. It is

submitted that the Supreme Court had held that, not only at the consideration

of the final plan but also when considering any amended final plan Court

should give notices in terms of section 06 of the Partition ordinance. He

further submitted that although that decision was on section 06 of the

Partition Ordinance, and that there is no similar provision in section 36(1) of

the present Partition Act, the Court should have issued notices in terms of

the Partition Ordinance.

12. This argument is untenable. This is not the correct position of the law as at

date. Section 06 of the Partition Ordinance No.10 of 1986 is not similar to

section 36(1) of the present Act No. 21 of 1977. For the purpose of clarity, I

may reproduce the relevant sections.

13. Section 06 of the Partition Ordinance No. 10 of 1863:

" ... On the receipt of the return of such commission the Court

shall fix a day, of which notice shall be issued to all the parties and

which said notice shall be served in the same way as the original

summons for considering the return; and on that day or such other

day as the Court shall then appoint, the Court after summarily

hearing the parties, and if need be , making such further reference as

the Court shall deem necessary, shall either confirm or modifY the

7

partition proposed by the commissioner and enter final judgment

accordingly in the cause. "

14. The Law as at now, sections 35 and 36 of the Partition Act No. 21 of 1977 as

amended by Act No.17 of 1997;

"35. After surveyor make a return to the commission, Court

shall call the case in open Court and shall fix a date for the

consideration of the scheme of partition proposed by the surveyor.

The date so fixed shall be a date not earlier than 30 days after the

receipt of such return by the Court. "

"36(1). On the date fixed under section 35 or on any later date

which the Court may fix for the purpose, the Court may, after

summary inquiry: ... "

15. Therefore, it is clear that the legislature has removed the portion 'Court

shallflX a day, of which notice shall be issued to all the parties and which

said notice shall be served in the same way as the original summons for

considering the return;' which was in section 06 of the Partition Ordinance

No. 10 of 1863, when the Partition Act No. 21 of 1977 was enacted and also

when it was amended by Act No. 17 of 1997. It is also pertinent to note that

when the Partition Ordinance was first repealed and Partition Act No. 16 of

1951 was enacted, even in that Act, the provision to issue notices to all

parties again for the scheme inquiry was removed.

16. Hence, the argument that the learned District Judge should have issued

notice to all parties for the scheme inquiry cannot be accepted. It was the

obligation of the parties concerned to be present for the inquiry. As I

8

' . . ~

mentioned before, Court will not relieve the parties of the consequences of

their own folly or negligence in applications of restitutio in integrum.

17. Petitioner was represented by counsel on 09.03.2011 when the settlement

was entered in open Court. Therefore, Petitioner cannot say that she did not

know about the proceedings dated 09.03.2011. This application is made on

12th August 2014, more than 3 years after the order on settlement was made.

No acceptable reason for the delay of more than 3 years to invoke the

jurisdiction of this court is submitted by the petitioner. It was entirely due to

the lack of diligence on the part of the Petitioner that has caused more than

03 years delay to come to court. Hence, the Petitioner is not entitled to the

relief sought in this application.

Application is refused with costs.
