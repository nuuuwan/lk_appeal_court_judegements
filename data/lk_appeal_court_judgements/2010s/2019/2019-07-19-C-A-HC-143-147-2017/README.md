ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st to 5th accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the "1st to

5th appellants"), by their individual petitions of appeal addressed to this

Court, seek to invoke its appellate jurisdiction over the judgment and

2

sentence imposed on them by the High Court of Panadura. The five

appellants were indicted by the Hon Attorney General under Sections 140,

296 read with 146 and 296 read with 32 of the Penal Code in respect of the

death of Mohammed Naumath Mohammed Munas which occurred on the 1st

June 1990 at Bandaragama.

Upon service of the indictment by the High Court of Panadura, the

appellants opted for a trial without a jury. The trial against the appellants

was commenced on 23.06.2010 and with the pronouncement of its

judgment on 30.06.2017, all five appellants were convicted for the 1st and

2nd counts by the trial Court. The trial Court made no pronouncement on

the 3rd count since it considered the said count only as an "alternative

count to the second count".

Each of the appellants were sentenced to a six-month term of

imprisonment in addition to a fine of Rs. 5,000.00 with a default term of

one-month imprisonment on their conviction to the 1st count. All five

appellants were sentenced to death upon their conviction for the 2nd count.

The prosecution presented a case against the appellants, based on

several items of circumstantial evidence.

The team of police officers led by the 1st appellant, having arrested

one "Wappa" had went in search of the deceased to his house. They

arrested Munseer (PW2) on the information of Wappa near the deceased's

house. The team then proceeded to the mosque in search of the deceased.

They informed the trustees of the mosque that the deceased is wanted for

questioning and the trustees undertook to surrender the deceased, once

the Friday noon religious activities are over.

3

It was revealed that the three suspects were thereafter taken to a safe

house operated by the police team in Mavugama of Horana area and were

questioned about their involvement of melting robbed gold jewellery that

were given to them by a subversive group th;:lt operated in the area.

Munseer claimed that the officers have then taken them to a nearby school

hall and they were assaulted after having suspended them on a cross beam

by their thumbs after tying them together with shoe laces. When the

witness was hung, he lost consciousness. He heard the deceased

complaining of a stomach-ache after the assault and was purging. The

deceased was thereafter taken in a vehicle and the following morning it

was learnt that he had died of gunshot wounds.

The post mortem examination, conducted on the body of the

deceased by medical officer Dr. de Almeida, revealed that he had suffered

a 1/2 inch circular firearm entry wound on the front of his chest located 9

inches below the shoulder joint. This firearm injury caused damage to

several blood vessels of his right lung and 1 1/2 pints of blood was found

collected in the chest cavity. She also found a bullet embedded on the back

wall of the chest cavity over the right scapula, located 4 inches below the

shoulder.

It is her opinion that the deceased may have died after about 1 1/2

hours after receiving the injury on his chest, due to "shock and

haemorrhage following firearm injury".

She also noted a circular shaped abrasion with a diameter of 1/2 inch,

located 6 inches below the above described firearm entry wound. A one-

inch-long lacerated wound was observed on the back of the deceased's

4

chest located over the 5th and 6th intercostal space and 3 inches from the

midline.

In addition, multiple abrasions were also seen on his legs below

knee joints.

Tudor Dias, was the Assistant Superintendent of Police, who

investigated the incident of shooting reported to him by the 1st appellant

immediately after its happening. He had visited the place of shooting at

about 2.00 a.m. and had taken charge of the official revolver issued to the

1 st appellant with the balance 23 of 25 ammunition, issued along with it.

The barrel of the revolver smelt of recent fire. He recorded statements of

the five appellants and visited Batuwita School and the house from which

the rope was borrowed to hang the witness Munseer and the deceased.

His inspection of the place where the incident of shooting took place

revealed that it is an isolated spot in a cinnamon plantation. He observed

that the grass had flattened where there were several blood patches were

seen.

At the close of the prosecution, the trial Court had ruled that the

appellants had a case to answer and called for their defence. All five

appellants have given ~vidence under oath.

The 1st appellant admitted having arrested the deceased in

connection of receiving robbed gold jewellery for melting and after

questioning he agreed to show where some of these items of jewellery

were hidden. He led the police team to the cinnamon plantation where the

incident occurred. The 1st appellant had held the deceased by one arm

while holding his service revolver with the other. His service revolver was 5

defective as its safety latch was not working properly. They were walking

along in a single file and they could see the area in the star light. Suddenly

the deceased attempted to grab his revolver and during the ensuing

struggle it fired accidently injuring the deceased. He was then rushed to

Panadura Hospital where he succumbed to the injury and the incident was

immediately reported to his superiors.

The 2nd to 5th appellants stated that they saw the 1st appellant and

the deceased struggling. They could not use the T 56 rifles they possessed

to control the deceased due to the risks involved. They heard two gun

shots and have transported the injured deceased to Hospital.

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court revealed that it had

considered the alleged previous conduct of assaulting the deceased by

hanging him with thumbs by the appellants, taking the deceased to make

recoveries when he complained of his illness, the failure to handcuff the

deceased, the distance of fire and its angle supports the inference that they

intended to cause his death. Hence, the trial Court found the appellants

guilty to the 1st and 2nd counts of the indictment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellants

sought intervention of this Court to set them aside on the several grounds

of appeal that had been urged on their behalf by Counsel.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the 1st appellant

raised the following grounds of appeal;

a. has the trial Court acted on the basis that the appellant was guilty

of the offence and thereby throughout denied a fair trial

guaranteed to him by the Constitution?

6

b. has the trial Court failed to consider that at least a reasonable

doubt is made out by the appellant?

c. has the trial Court taken into consideration irrelevant questions

of law whereby the assessment of evidence on real issues is

forgotten?

d. whether the appellant was denied of a fair trial due to the

extraordinary delay?

In support of the 2nd appellant, learned President's Counsel who

appeared for him raised the following grounds of appeal;

a. there was no evidence of an unlawful assembly,

b. the prosecution evidence is wholly unreliable,

c. the errors committed by the trial Court vitiates the conviction

entered against the appellant.

The grounds of appeal raised by the learned Counsel on behalf of

the 3rd appellant are as follows;

a. the evidence presented by the prosecution is grossly inadequate

to draw the inference that the appellant was a member of an

unlawful assembly,

b. the trial Court rejected the appellant's evidence unreasonably.

Learned Counsel for the 4th appellant relied on the following ground

of appeal;

a. prosecution has failed to prove the 4th appellant was a member of

the unlawful assembly,

7

Learned President's Counsel for the 5th appellant complained that

his client was not afforded a fair trial before the High Court, upon the

following considerations;

a. the time duration of 27 years since the date of offence to the date

of conviction,

b. the prosecution failed to prove the identity of the 5th appellant

since there were no witness for the incident of shooting which

resulted in the death of the deceased,

c. the trial Court failed to appreciate that the prosecution had failed

to establish criminal liability of the 5th appellant in relation to its

allegation of him, being a member of an unlawful assembly.

Learned Counsel who appeared for the five appellants, in their

detailed submissions in support of the respective grounds of appeal they

have raised, have mounted attacks broadly on two main areas of the

prosecution evidence. One such area is the unreliability of the evidence of

Munseer and the imputation of constructive criminal liability on the basis

of the appellants being members of an unlawful assembly that had been

formed with the common object of causing injuries to the deceased.

However, Learned President's Counsel for the 1st appellant, In

addition to his submissions on these broad areas of dispute, complained of

a probable prejudiced mind of the trial Court to the detriment of the

appellants. He sought to impress upon this Court that the line of

questioning undertaken by the trial Court of the appellants, is a clear

indication of the existence of such a pre-determined state of mind and

therefore its approach to the evaluation of their version of events was

8

tainted resulting in a denial of a fair trial for the appellants, a right

guaranteed by the Constitution.

It is submitted that the repeated use of the word /I inhuman

assault/ attack" in its judgment by the trial Court, in reference to the

alleged assault on the deceased, as spoken to by witness Munseer, which

claim had no support from the medical evidence. However, it had clearly

coloured the mind of the trial Court, prompting it to indulge in an

intrusive session of questioning of the appellants. Having probed the

appellants with a pre conceived notion, the trial Court had thereupon

failed to attach due weightage to the version of events, presented before it

by the appellants, in their evidence.

This complaint by the 1st appellant has two inbuilt components to it.

The propriety of the /I intrusive" questioning by the trial Court is one while

the repeated use of the word /I inhuman assault/ attack" without

supportive medical evidence represents the other.

The question of the propriety of the line of questioning undertaken

by the trial Court needed to be considered at the outset.

It is seen from the proceedings relating to the evidence of the 1st

appellant that the trial Court had actively participated in the questioning

during examination in chief as well as in cross examination. Although

some of the areas on which the trial Court intervened to clarify could have

been anyway done by the Counsel. What disturbs this Court is, of these

several instances, the way the trial Court had formulated its question that

had been put to the 1st appellant twice, on the incident. Those questions

were formulated by the trial Court in the following manner;

9

(a) g: O@l!>Q')ozo 0Q'O@l!> ,Or5)~<; 00Cl BlQ)0Q)? (at p. 420 of the brief)

(b) g: 0aCl ~~ 3>z~ ~o 0a~ (3)o>g~ r5)S @C )O<3)cd Bl~ ~Bl<;? (at p.

423 of the brief)

In addition, the trial Court questioned the 1st appellant during cross

examination that" g. o>~ r5)C~0~ o 6Q') el~a)Q Q')~~ r5)C<9l<;, qdel(g~

00)@S0C~ (3)~~ r5)S ~r5)c)ad Bl0~ ~~ r5)c~ ~Q'), ~c QO)O@l!> Ql~C)O

odele ~r5) cdo>ocd<;?" (at p. 438) clearly indicating its mind that his

evidence on the point is not acceptable.

The questioning in relation to the incident had been put to the .

witness upon his claim that his gun with a defective safety mechanism had

accidently went off during the scuffle he had with the deceased, when he

attempted to wrest the revolver out of his hand.

The most fundamental issue that had to be decided by the trial

Court is whether the injury caused to the deceased was due to intentional

act of the 1st appellant, as the prosecution claimed or it was due to an

accidental firing of the gun as the 1 st appellant claimed in his evidence.

The power to put questions by the presiding Judge is recognised in

Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Delivering judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen

v Perera 66 N.L.R. 553, Basnayake CJ thought it fit to add a caution to trial

Judges, who preside over jury trials, in questioning an accused who elects

to give evidence, as his Lordship stated that;

"A Judge acting under section 165 should be wary in

questioning witnesses under the powers conferred

10

thereby, especially when the witness is an accused

person giving evidence on his own behalf./1

In Sisilinona v Balasuriya (2002) 1 Sri L.R. 404, it was held that;

" ... by section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance a Judge

is vested with power to put questions to a witness in

order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant

facts. While the widest powers in regard to

examination of witness are undoubtedly conferred on

the court by section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance

and section 164 of the Civil Procedure Code, these

powers are not without certain limitations. Discussing

the aspect of power vested with a Judge to examine a

witness, Monir in his book on Evidence, 4th edition

vol. II, p. 949 says: One of the well-recognised

limitations of the powers of the court under section

165 of the Evidence Ordinance is that the court must

not question the witness in the spirit of beating him

down or encouraging him to give an answer. One

must also not forget the fact that even witnesses who

are able to stand their ground in the face of the severest

cross-examination at the hands of opposing counsel are

in view of the deference with which they treat the court

inclined to treat with greatest regard suggestions

when they come from court and are couched in

compelling language and it is a rare witness who will

11

steadily maintain his version in the face of such

questioning by court."

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his submissions sought to

justify the questioning by the trial Court by placing reliance upon a

judgment of the Supreme Court of India in State of Rajasthan v Ani &

Others - decided on 13.01.1997, where Thomas J expressed the view that;

"Section 165 of the Evidence Act confers vast and

unrestricted powers on the trial Court to put "any

question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any

witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or

irrelevant" in order to discover relevant facts. The said

section was framed lavishly studding it with the word

II any" which could only have been inspire by the

Legislative intent to confer unbridled power on the

trial Court to use the power whenever he deems it

necessary to elicit truth. Even if any question crossed

into irrelevancy the same would not transgress beyond

the contours of powers of the Court. This is clear from

the words. "

It is thus seen that the widest possible power had been conferred

upon trial Courts by the said judgment. However, his Lordship then

proceeds to identify the purpose for which the said section was enacted

and then also to demarcate its scope, which could be found couched in the

wording contained in the next paragraph, as it states that;

12

"A Judge is expected to actively participate in the trial,

elicit necessary materials from witnesses at the

appropriate context which he feels necessary for

reaching the correct conclusion. There is nothing

which inhibits his power to put questions to the

witness, either during examination in chief or cross

examination or even during re-examination to elicit

truth. The corollary of it is that if a Judge felt that a

witness has committed an error or a slip it is the duty

of the judge to ascertain whether it was so, for, to err is

human and the chances of erring may accelerate under

stress of nervousness during cross examination.

Criminal justice is not to be founded on erroneous

answers spelled out by witnesses during evidence

collecting process. It is a useful exercise for the trial

Judge to remain active and alert so that errors can be

minimised. "

The above quoted questions that had been put to the appellant, by

the trial Court presupposes the fact that the 1st appellant had consciously

shot the deceased. They were formulated in such a way to incorporate that

supposition in to the body of its question. When a trial Court puts such

questions to an accused, as it did during the trial stage, even before it

considered the body of evidence that had been presented before it in its

totality, it is quite reasonable if an appellant forms an impression that the

trial Court had already made up its mind on the aforesaid fundamental

issue. Such impression is further fortified into a belief when the trial Court

13

puts these questions even before his evidence was formally over and

without applying any of the time tested evaluation methods for his

credibility.

In considering the complaint by the learned President's Counsel in

the light of the above quoted juridical precedents, it appears that the trial

Court may have strayed away of its permissible scope of questioning as

envisaged by Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance.

It is evident from the judgment that the trial Court had used the

adjectives "cruel, inhuman, merciless" when it referred to the alleged

assault of the deceased by the appellants repeatedly in the impugned

judgment. The appellants have challenged this assumption made by the

trial Court on the basis that the evidence of assault as described by witness

Munseer is not supported by the medical evidence. It was highlighted by

the appellants that if the deceased was hung from a cross bar after tying

his thumbs together with a shoe lace and rope, as claimed by Munseer,

there would obviously be injuries that are indicative of such an action

since his body weight is concentrated on the thumbs. Munseer admits that

the full weight rested on the thumbs when the deceased was suspended by

a rope by the appellants. The medical officer however was emphatic that

she saw no abnormality in the hands or in fingers of the deceased at the

time of her examination. She had filled the required space in her report

with the word "Normal". The deceased had suffered multiple abrasions

and contusions on his lower limbs as per the post mortem report but

Munseer was clear in his evidence after the assault on the deceased, he saw

14

no injuries on the deceased. The only apparent difficulty the deceased had

at that time was a stomach-ache and the appellants have provided some

Panadol before they took him out in a vehicle that late evening.

In these circumstances and in the absence of any medical evidence to

support, the appellants challenge that the use of the adjectives such as

/I cruel, inhuman, merciless" in describing the alleged assault is another

factor that is indicative of the possible prejudiced mind of the trial Court.

This complaint by the appellants should be considered along with

the challenge mounted by them on the reliability of the witness Munseer.

All Counsel for the appellants referred in their submissions to the

instances where, the said witness had made inconsistent statements before

the trial Court, in his narration of the sequence of events which culminated

with the death of the deceased.

It appears that there were two other persons when the appellants

took Munseer and the deceased to the house at Mavugama. The prosecution

did not call any of them as witnesses in support of their case. The

prosecution totally relied on the testimony of Munseer to highlight the way

the appellants have treated the deceased after his arrest at the mosque.

This aspect was relevant to the case presented by the prosecution

since the charges were framed on the basis of constructive liability.

Munseer was to disclose the culpable mind-set of each of the appellants,

upon their actions during the period of interrogation that had followed the

arrest.

15

It was highlighted that Munseer never made any complaint about the

incident of assault, immediately after him being released on bail,

subsequent to the death of the deceased in custody.

The investigations were commenced upon a petition sent by the wife

of the deceased in seeking compensation for the death of her husband. A

statement from the wife of the deceased, Marsuna, was recorded only on

02.12.1995, after five years since her husband's death. Munseer made his

statement also on the same day regarding the incident. This factor favours

the witness as it indicates his disinterestedness of the incident of shooting

while it also invites consideration of the reliability of his claim in the light

of a possible fabrication. The prosecution presented evidence of ASP Dias,

who visited the place of the incident and recorded statements of all five

appellants. In this context, Munseer's reference to the five appellants in

connection with the death of the deceased, is not based on his own

imagination. But his clai.m of assault on the deceased by hanging him by

thumbs could not be afforded any reliability.

In this context this Court pause to frame an issue whether witness

Munseer presented his evidence consistently on material points ?

The trial Court, in its judgment stated that it accepts the evidence of

Munseer as credible evidence since there is no reason to disbelieve it (at

p.714 of the brief). The trial Court also found the evidence of Munseer

satisfied the test of consistency when compared with medical evidence

since there were injuries on the body of the deceased. It concluded

therefore his evidence is credible to a "very high degree" (at p.720 of the

brief).

16

It is unfortunate that learned Counsel who represented the

appellants before the trial Court had failed to invite attention to the

improbability of the claim of Munseer that the deceased was hung up by

his thumbs and then beaten up in the absence of any supportive medical

evidence. Witness Munseer said the deceased was assaulted with clubs on

his legs for over ten minutes. The prosecution, although elicited evidence

through the medical witness that there were multiple abrasions and

contusions seen on lower limbs of the deceased, did not connect them with

the alleged assault by clarifying whether those injuries could be a result of

a sustained assault by clubs. The medical evidence on these injuries lacked

clarity as the medical officer generally referred to them as "multiple

abrasions and contusions" without referring to any such injury

individually. If the nature of the injuries is such that they could not be

separately described or identified, then it poses a question whether those

injuries are consistent with a claim of an assault sustained for over ten

minutes using clubs as the prosecution states or consistent with the claim

of the appellants that they were caused during the struggling with the 1st

appellant over a rough surface.

The judiciary has showed no hesitation to condemn any acts of

violence commited on the suspects who were arrested and detained by the

Police. It took very serious note if and as when such evidence surfaced,

irrespective of the nature of the legal proceedings during which it

transpired. In this context, it is relevant here to quote Atukorala J, in the

judgment of Sudath Silva v Kodituwakku (1987) 2 Sri L.R. 126, who

strongly expressed the view of the apex Court on following terms;

17

#Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no

person shall be subject to torture or to cruel or

inhuman punishment or treatment ... Constitutional

safeguards are generally directed against the State and

its organs. The Police Force, being an organ of the

State is obliged by the Constitution to secure and

advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict

the same in any manner and under any circumstances.

It is therefore the duty if this Court to protect and

defend this right jealously to its fullest measure with a

view to ensuring that this right is declared and

intended to be fundamental is always kept

fundamental and that the Executive by its action does

not reduce it to a mere illusion."

Therefore, it is natural that the trial Court had taken a serious view

of the allegation of torture levelled against the appellants since it relates to

an instance of a death of a suspect in police custody. The deceased is

undoubtedly entitled to the protection of the presumption of innocence

until a competent Court, after a duly conducted trial, displaces it.

However, in taking a concerned approach to the allegation of torture, the

trial Court must review the available evidence carefully, as it should do at

all times, and arrive at a justifiable conclusion based on such evidence. It

must be mindful not to grant an evidentiary concession wittingly or

unwittingly to the prosecution in relation to its overall burden to establish

18

charges beyond reasonable doubt, when it presents a case with an

allegation of torture in custody.

Returning to the appeal before this Court, it appears that either

Munseer had added some embroidery to his evidence by claiming they

were assaulted after hanging them by their thumbs or, considering the

possibility in the other end of the spectrum, lied over this claim. Learned

High Court Judge who delivered the judgment had only seen the latter

part of Munseer's cross examination and therefore had limited opportunity

to observe his demeanour. In fact, the trial Court had placed no reliance

on the demeanour of the witness in its judgment in the determination of

his credibility, since it was quite content with concluding his evidence is

credible as it is consistent with the medical evidence. This conclusion

reached by the trial Court is therefore seriously compromised one since it

had failed to consider this vital inconsistency with medical evidence on the

claim of hanging by thumbs.

In the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the 2nd

appellant, his main thrust was on the imposition of criminal liability on

constructive liability. Learned Counsel for the 3rd to 5th appellants too have

made similar submissions in respect of their clients and posed the valid

question as to the point of time at which the unlawful assembly was

formed by the appellants in that evening?

During their submissions learned Counsel raised the following

points since the conviction of the appellants is based on constructive

liability;

19

a. there was no reliable evidence before the trial Court on

participation of each appellant in the said unlawful assembly,

b. there was no reliable evidence before the trial Court on the

identity of those who participated in the said unlawful assembly.

It was also submitted that the prosecution has made an attempt to

present a case of circumstantial evidence against each of the appellants.

The prosecution had no evidence to explain the circumstances under

which the deceased had suffered the only gunshot injury. Learned Counsel

submitted that the appellants have offered a valid explanation to the death

of the deceased in the form of accidental fire during a scuffle. But the trial

Court had erroneously rejected that defence although the prosecution had

no evidence to rebut it.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General sought to counter the appellant's

submission on the basis that they established a strong prima facie case

against the appellants through the several items of circumstantial evidence

that had been placed before the trial Court and therefore it was incumbent

upon the appellants to offer a valid explanation. The explanation offered

by them could not be accepted by the trial Court as a valid one as it is

unworthy of any credit due to the serious inconsistencies and

improbabilities. He produced a table indicating the various times given by

the several appellants indicatiing they were not consistent. In fact, the

learned DSG submits that they made different statements in describing

what took place after 7.00 p.m. when they took him out of the safe house at

Mavugama. Learned DSG also indicated his doubts about the genuineness

20

of the claim of the appellants that the removal of the deceased that night

was to make certain recoveries.

It appears that the prosecution has relied on the evidence of lay

witnesses Munseer, Marsuna and the ASP Dias (who recorded statements

of all five appellants immediately after the shooting incident was

reported), in support of its allegation of an unlawful assembly.

The witnesses Munseer and Marsuna claimed they identified the

appellants when they saw them at the Magistrate's Court of Horana and

later in the High Court during trial. Marsuna, in her evidence in chief

claimed that five or six male persons who were in their twenties came in

search of her husband pretending to be his friends. She saw them again at

the Magistrate's Court of Horana. She knows that one of her uncles had

made a complaint after several years over the death of the deceased.

However, during her cross examination she candidly admitted that she

identified the appellants after lapse of several years in the High Court

upon being told by witness Munseer.

Witness Munseer claimed that he saw the persons who assaulted

them that night at Bandaragama Police soon after the death of the deceased.

He said he did not identify any of them either by name or description at

the Magistrate's Court. In response to clearly a leading question by the

prosecution (at p. 192) the witness gave a general answer that all five of the

appellants have assaulted him. In describing the assault on the deceased,

the witness said one person held the rope while another hit him with a

club. He could not identify the person who held the rope. Then he said

21

only the 1st to 3rd appellants assaulted him but thereafter added that all of

them have assaulted (at p.194).

During cross examination, when the witness was questioned as to

his reference to 1/ @ c>oBc", he replied it is relation of the five appellants.

He then said there were six or eight persons at the time of the assault on

the deceased and then said, in addition to the five appellants, there was

another person.

Thus, it is clear that the identification of the appellants before the

trial Court by these two witnesses is made because they were paraded in

the dock. Marsuna relied on the identification by Munseer to identify the

appellants in the High Court. Munseer however admitted that he did not

identify any of the appellants at the Magistrate's Court. There was no

identification parade conducted; understandably due to the long lapse of

time since the incident. However, that leaves the identification made by

the said two witnesses in the High Court to a mere identification of the

appellants from the dock.

In Munirathne and Others v The State (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 382 it was

held by this Court that;

"Jurists on Evidence have expressed the view

that it is undesirable and unsafe for the Court to

rely upon the identification of an accused in

Court for the first time or dock identification,

the reason being that a witness may well think

to himself that the police must have got hold of

the right person and it is, so easy for a witness

22

to point to the accused in the dock. In this

connection vide Cross on Evidence 6th Edition

value of dock identification in this country -

observation in his judgment in Gunaratne

"The other witnesses identified the

accused for the first time at the trial in

the dock. Again it has been repeatedly

said even in the recent past by this

Court, in more cases than one that this

type of evidence is worthless and, if I

may add, no useful purpose will be

served in leading such evidence. "

23

The principle of evidence that had been laid down in the said

authority clearly diminishes the value of a dock identification made by

witnesses Munseer and Marsuna who made such claim of identification for

the first time in the High Court. Of course the prosecution could rely on

the reasonable inference that the five appellants were there at the time of

shooting since their statements were recorded by the ASP who visited the

scene soon after the incident of shooting. But the unreliability of the dock

identification deprives the prosecution of the identities of the persons who

were involved with the alleged assault on the deceased in support of its

contention of unlawful assembly.

The discussion on the issue of identity had therefore led this Court

to consider the main thrust of the appellants' collective contention, based

on imposition of constructive criminal liability. The issues of whether there

was an unlawful assembly which had been formed with the common

object of causing hurt to the deceased, whether the appellants could be

convicted for the offence of murder and whether the trial Court had

properly decided those issues upon the evidence led before it had to be

decided by this Court in the light of the submissions of Counsel for the

appellants as well as for the prosecution.

It is important for the trial Court, when it proceeds to consider the

case against each appellant in relation to the allegation that they were

members of an unlawful assembly, also to consider the question at which

point of time the unlawful assembly was formed. This is an important

consideration since the appellants were serving police officers who were

attached to an anti subversive unit at the time of the incident who were

assigned with a safe house to conduct their operations. Ordinarily when 24

one person joins another four to form an unlawful assembly or joins an

already formed unlawful assembly, he does so with his own free will.

When a police officer is attached to a team on a selective basis, that

decision is taken by his superior and there is no question of his consent in

such selection. He must obey the orders of his superior. His duties are

clearly laid down in Section 56 of the Police Ordinance and is duty bound

to "promptly to obey and execute all orders ... ".

When viewed in this light, at the time of making the arrest of

Munseer and the deceased, the 2nd to 5th appellants led by the 1st appellant

were clearly performing an official function to which they were assigned

with. The prosecution is clear that they did so apparently on the

information provided by a person called "Wappa" who was in their

vehicle. Munseer admits Wappa was there when he was arrested and that

they were questioned over the robberies of certain jewellery shops. He also

admitted that they were engaged in the business of melting gold jewellery

bought from the public auctions that are conducted by the banks. At that

time there was no formation of an unlawful assembly.

The prosecution had no detailed evidence of what each of the

appellants did when they took the deceased out late in the evening after

leaving Munseer in Mavugama safe house. It is the 1st appellant who said

that the deceased sustained a gunshot injury whilst grappling for his

revolver when it accidently went off.

In the opinion of the medical witness, the laceration on the back of

the chest of the deceased could have been caused during a struggle. Then,

if at all the 2nd to 4th appellants' participation in that process is limited to

25

the causing of the injuries that were seen on lower limbs of the deceased

and accompanying the 1st appellant to the place where the incident took

place.

The trial Court found the appellants guilty of the 1st count on the

basis that they assaulted the deceased after his arrest and then took him to

this lonely spot to be killed that night. There was no conspiracy charge

levelled against the appellants by the prosecution. In relation to the 1st

count which has been framed under section 140 of the Penal Code, it was

incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that each of the appellants acted

in furtherance of the common object of the unlawful assembly, which was

to cause hurt to the deceased.

Dr. Gour in his treatise titled The Indian Penal Code. (13th Ed) has

identified several factors which should be established by the prosecution

when it sought to impose "constructive criminality" on an accused by

invocation of provisions of Section 149 of the Penal Code of India. These

factors listed at p. 528 are as follows;

a. there was an unlawful assembly,

b. that the accused was a member thereof at the time

of committing the offence,

c. that he intentionally joined or continued in that

assembly,

d. that he knew of the object of the assembly,

e. that an offence was committed by a member of such

assembly, f.that it was committed;

26

1. in prosecution of the common object

of the assembly, or,

ll. was such, as the members of the

assembly knew to be likely to be

committed in prosecution of their

common unlawful object.

If the evidence of Munseer is accepted in its totality as credible

evidence, then some of the 2nd to 5th appellants, and not all of them knew

that the common object of unlawful assembly to cause hurt since they

participated in the assault. Those who knew of the common object have

achieved it when they assaulted the deceased after hanging him. But if

only some of the appellants knew, then there are no five persons to form

an unlawful assembly.

Then the appellants took the deceased in a vehicle when he

complained of a stomach-ache. Thereafter only the news of his death had

reached Munseer. That being the prosecution case, there was no evidence

before Court that when the deceased sustained his fatal injury whether

each of the appellants have acted either" in prosecution of the common object

of the assembly" or they knew his death would "likely to be committed in

prosecution of their common unlawful object", unless of course the unlawful

assembly which had already formed continued beyond the school hall.

Dr. Gour in his book also considered the limitations of the scope of .

Section 146, in imposing constructive criminal liability which he identified

in the following terms (at p.524);

27

" ... a person may join an unlawful assembly with an

unlawful object, but it does not necessarily follow that

he endorses all that the other members say or do, nor is

he, therefore, responsible for their acts of which he was

not clearly cognisant."

He further adds that;

". .. the members of an unlawful assembly may have

community of object only up to a certain point,

beyond which they mere differ in their objects, and the

knowledge possessed by each member of what is likely

to be committed in prosecution of their common object

will vary not only according to information at his

command, but also according to the extent to which he

shares the community of object and as a consequence

the effect of this section may be different on different

members of the same unlawful assembly."

This approach in the imposition of constructive criminal liability on

an accused requires, if he was to find guilty to the offence another member

of such unlawful assembly had committed, an individual treatment of the

role played by each of the accused by a trial Court.

Divisional bench of the Court of Appeal, in Ranawaka and Others v

The Attorney general (1985) 2 Sri L.R. 210 held the view that;

" ... the offence committed must be immediately

connected with the common object of the unlawful

assembly of which the accused were members ... the act

28

..

must be one which upon evidence appears to have been

done with a view to accomplish the common object

attributed to the members of the unlawful assembly.

No offence executes or tends to execute the common

object unless the commission of that offence is involved

in the common object."

In the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Wilson Silva v

The Queen 76 NLR 414, Weeramanry J stated that i

"The questions whether a person is aware of facts

which render an assembly unlawful, whether he

intentionally joins such an assembly or continues in it,

and whether the common object of the assembly is to

commit an offence, are all matters which must be

determined from a series of circumstances. The acts or

omissions of each alleged participant, the weapons

used, the manner of their arrival at the scene, their

prior utterances and so to speak every circumstance of

significance in this regard would have to be evaluated.

Such a task is only possible upon the basis of rules

relating to the evaluation and assessment of

circumstantial evidence.... On the degree of proof

required of the sharing of a common object, the

governing principles are no different from those

relating to the degree of proof of common intention,

and the authorities hereinafter referred to, showing

29

..

that such a conclusion must be an inescapable one,

would be applicable."

The trial Court, in convicting the 2nd to 5th appellants under the 2nd

count for the offence of murder, had acted on the circumstances such as;

the deceased was taken to a lonely place in the late evening without hand-

cuffs with the intention of causing his death after "inhumanly" assaulting

him.

Clearly there were no circumstances placed before the trial Court by

the prosecution to infer that the 2nd to 5th appellants' ever did anything

other than to accompany the 1st appellant and the deceased armed with

their T 56 weapons, which they never used. Similarly, the prosecution

placed no evidence as to why only the deceased was taken out that night

leaving Munseer and Wappa and particularly selecting only the deceased

awaiting his dreadful fate. There was no allegation that the appellants

have acted with prior animosity in relation to the deceased.

When queried by this Court as to the exact point on which the

appellants have formed an unlawful assembly, learned DSG replied that it

was probably formed when the appellants have taken away the deceased

that night. If that is the case, then it had placed no evidence before the trial

Court to infer that each of the 2nd to 5th appellants knew that they would

cause further hurt to the deceased and it is likely that one of them would

shot him in prosecution of their common object. Merely carrying firearms

would not satisfy this requirement.

30

..

After a careful consideration of the attendant circumstances this

Court reached the opinion that in this instance the prosecution has failed

to establish its case against the 2nd to 5th appellants as they fail to establish

that all of them have participated in an unlawful assembly which had its

common object as causing hurt to the deceased and while prosecuting their

common object one of them is likely to cause the death of the deceased,

without a shadow of reasonable doubt.

In relation to the 1st appellant, the prosecution has placed evidence

before the trial Court that the service revolver was recently fired and two

of the ammunition issued to him have been used presumably in the said

firing. The death of the deceased was due to a gunshot wound. Therefore,

he clearly owed an explanation.

The 1st appellant offered an explanation. He claimed that the

deceased had tried to wrest the firearm out of him and in the process the

weapon, which had a defective safety pin, accidently went off causing the

fatal injury. The trial Court had rejected this explanation on the footing

that there was no sign of any close range firing as the 1st appellant claims

and the deceased was in an upright position when the two shots that were

fired at, from a position in front of him.

When considered these factors in the light of the circumstances

under which the investigations were conducted and the medical evidence

31

..

it is questionable whether the prosecution had established its case beyond

reasonable doubt against the 1st appellant.

There were no two shots fired at the deceased as erroneously held

by the trial Court for he had suffered only one gunshot injury on his chest

as per medical evidence. Similarly, the opinion of the medical witness that

the shot was fired when the deceased was in upright position seemed

unlikely for the reason that the entry wound is located 9 inches from the

shoulder and a single bullet was recovered embedded within the chest

cavity near scapula from a position described by the expert as 4 inches

below the shoulder. If the deceased was shot at when he was upright (his

height was 5'7") then it is reasonable to expect to find the bullet also

embedded in the body around nine inches from the shoulder. It appears

that the bullet had travelled in an upward trajectory inside the body which

is indicative that the firing is from a lower elevation to that of the

deceased, if he was standing upright.

The 1st appellant claimed that his gun went off when they grappled

for it and the deceased was on top of him after their fall on the ground.

This explanation clearly is not inconsistent with that upward trajectory.

It appears that the trial Court heavily relied on the expert opinion

that the shot may have fired more than three feet away as there was no

blackening and tattooing seen around the entry wound. However, the

32

medical witness expressed her opinion that it could be even from a

distance of one foot away. She was not shown the weapon at any point of

time by the prosecution, although it was produced during the trial as a

production, and therefore it had deprived her of an opportunity of

expressing a specific opinion thereby and limiting it only to a general

opinion. Clearly she had limited experience in the ballistics and even with

that, the prosecution should have clarified this issue.

The medical witness had also noticed another semi-circular

contusion with a diameter of 1/2 inch, few inches below the entry wound.

There was no explanation of it by the prosecution. The 1st appellant

claimed that the deceased was on top of him and they struggled for the

control of the weapon and it is possible that it was caused during such a

struggle. The deceased also had a laceration on the back of his chest which

could have been caused during a struggle.

H.N.G. Fernando CI, in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal

in Kandakutty v The Queen 75 N.L.R. 457, considering the pivotal issue

that had been placed before the Court;" did the accused deliberately with the

intention to kill shoot at the accused, or did this gun which the accused had with

him fire off accidentally while he was struggling with the deceased's father-in-law

Ponnan. In short the issue is, was the firing intentional or accidental ?"

proceeded to answer it in favour of the appellant, after adopting the

principles of law enunciated in the judgments of Dionis v The King 52

33

N.L.R. 547 and Thuraisamy v The Queen 54 N.L.R. 449 in the following

manner;

"The case of Dionis was, like the instant case, one in

which the accused had stated in evidence that his gun

went off in consequence of an attempt made by another

man to wrest the gun. This Court made the following

observations;

II In the opinion of the Court there was no

burden on the appellant to prove any of the facts

alleged by him. The burden lay throughout on

the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt

that the death in question was caused by an act

done by the appellant and done by him with the

intention or knowledge requisite for the

constitution of the offence of murder. If his

version of the circumstances created a

reasonable doubt either as to the factum or as to

the mens rea he was entitled to be acquitted of

the offence charged. It was a misdirection to tell

the Jury that there was a burden on the

appellant to satisfy them that his version was

probably true and that' he must not leave the

matter in doubt'. II

Again, in the case of Thuraisamy, where also the

accused gave evidence as to an accidental shooting,

this Court held that it was a misdirection to tell the

34

.. ,.

Jury that there was a burden on the accused to satisfy

them that his version was probably true. Gunasekara,

J. added that the appellant in that case would have

been entitled to an acquittal" even if it was not proved

that the injury was a result of an accident but there

was a reasonable doubt on that point". In the instant

case the Jury were not directed that, if on the whole of

the evidence they entertained a reasonable doubt on the

question whether or not the shooting was accidental

the accused was entitled to an acquittal."

When the evidence placed before the trial Court is considered in its

totality this Court is unable to decide that the incident of shooting is

intentional on the part of the 1st appellant and not an accident as he claims

without any reasonable doubt. As the apex Court quoted Woordroffe &

Ameer Ali on Law of Evidence " if the data leaves the mind of the trier in

equilibrium, the decision must be against the party having the burden of

persuasion. If the mind of the adjudicating tribunal is evenly balanced as to

whether the accused is guilty, it is its duty to acquit" (as per the judgment of

SC Appeal No. 99 of 2007 Padmatilaka v The Director General of

Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption - decided on 30.07.2009)

this Court holds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt against any of the appellants and the defence was

erroneously rejected. Their appeals are therefore entitled to succeed.

35

Accordingly , the conviction of the appellants on both counts and

the corresponding sentences that are imposed by the trial Court are set

,aside by this Court.

The appeals of the 1st to 5th appellants are allowed.
