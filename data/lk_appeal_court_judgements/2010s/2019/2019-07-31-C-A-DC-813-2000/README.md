A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

N.R. Sivendran with Ms. DushyanthiJaya~uriya for Plaintiff-Appellant

Athula Perera for the Defendant-Respondents

30.07.2019

This is a rei vindicatio action filed by the Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred

\ to as "the Plaintiff") on 8th June, 1990, against the Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Defendants"), in the District Court of Colombo, claiming

title to Lot lD in extent 1.5 perches as a roadway described in the 3rd schedule and Lot IC

in extent 5.5 perches described in the 4th schedule in the plaint, which are depicted in Plan

I No.590, and ordering the Defendants to remove the obstruction caused to the right of way

and for ejectment of theqeendants therefrom, and peaceful possession of the same and

for damages and costs. On the application of the Plahl.tiff the court issued an enjoining

order till an interim injunction was issued. The Defendants filed answer on 31st October, .. 1990 claiming right to Lot lB in Plan No.590 and denying the rights of the Plaintiff to the

Lots prayed for and for the dismissal of the Plaintiff's action.

After trial, the learned District Judge entered judgment on 29.09.2000 dismiSSing the

l;'laintiff's action with cos~ . Being aggrieved by this judgment, on 20th November, 2000,

the Plaintiff preferred this appeal to this Court. After ~everal dates the matter was taken

for argument on 21.11.2014 on which date the Counsel for the parties informed Court that

2

this matter can be settled by way of a survey and that the Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondents needed time to consider the settlement and for this purpose he needed to

consult his clients. On this ground this Court re-fixed this matter to be resumed on 4th

December, 2014.

The Journal Entry as recorded on 4th December 2014 reads as follows:-

UThe learned Counsel fur the Defendants-Respondents injonned Court that he is prepared to accept

plan bearing No. 1512 dated 13.01.1994 prepared by G.G. I{ammankada, Commissioner o/Surveyor

which has been produced marked 'PIT at the trial which is at page 419 (of the Appeal Brief) and that

the Defendants undertake to remove all obstructions in Lot lC and Lot lD in the said Plan and they

will not enter the said lots lC and lD. The Defendant-Respondents claim that they are entitled to

"t lot 'X' depicted in plan 1'/0.1512 and according to this plan in extent of 0.45 perches.

~1 " The Counsel for Defendants-Respondents informs Court that on the stated above, the Defendants-

Respondents are agreed to settle the matter on the said basis and that the;udgment in this case can

be pro-forma set aside.

The Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant makes an application to consider this suggestion made by

the Counsel for the ReslJondents. To be mentioned on 19.01.2015."

~ .

On 19.01.2015, it is record(-.d that "mention for settlemem oi129.01.2015." This entry gives the

I , . .. idea that since the Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant had moved for time to consider the , settlement proposed on the last date, his response was due and the case was to be

mentioned on 29.01.2015.

From 29.01.2015 onwards, the case had been postponed for several dates for the. purpose

of constituting a Bench to hear the case and finally~ when the case was taken up on

04.03~2015, it was recordelil as follows:

1

"Counsel for the Appellant informs Court that the settlement has been recorded on 04.12.14 as thl

PI Appellant preparedto accept the suggestions. Counsel for the Respondents informs Co'urt that thl

suggestions has not recorded correctly." (SiC).

3 ( .

, ~I

Both Counsel move for time to file written submission,s and to make an order on written

submissions, Written s(;bmissions to be filed on or befllre 02.04.2015. Order reserved by Han.

P.W.D.C.jayatilleke, J. ~n 25.05.2015. Mention on 02.o4.l5."

On 02.04.201S, when the matter came up before me for the first time, it was agreed to have

, , the matter mentioned for written submission on 27.0S.201S before Jayatilleke,]. As there

was a date that had already been given for delivering the order in this matter, it was

recorded that the date could be varied having regard to'the written submissions that had

to be filed in Court. On .il7.0S.201S, the case was PQstponed for 12.07.201S for written

submissions as Counsel"Iupved for further time.

The written submission that both Counsel wanted to file was on the question whether a

settlement had been arrived at having regard to the terms of settlement proposed by the

Counsel for the Defendants-Respondents as recorded on 04.12.2014 and the acceptance

thereof by the Plaintiff;Appellant on 04.03.201S. After the acceptance of the terms of

settlement by the Plaintiff'p Counsel was recorded, the ~earned Counsel for the Defendant-, Respondents informed Co~rt that the suggestion had not been recorded correctly. But he

did not go further to say what the correct suggestion ~as. Without clarifying this doubt,

, . both parties moved to file written submissions to ascertain whether what was recorded

and accepted is a settlement or not.

It must be noted that whilst the case was pending for.written submissions, the Journal

Entry of 30.03.2016, stat\,=s; Counsel for the PI Appellant states that the matter can be reached for a

settlement. In the circu~stanoq;, both Counsel state that this matter could be put off Matner is to be

resumed on 28.04.2016. The written submissions have sin<;:e been filed.

The crux of the matter in dispute in this appe~ is wh~ther the there was a settlement or

not. Whilst the Plaintiff-Appellant was agreeable to the settlement recorded on

04.12.2014, the Defendarits-Respondents stated that it was not properly recorded. This

was the argument that was put forward before this Court. I cannot help but disagree with

this contention. Of

4

~.

It has to be noted that the entire terms of the settlement recorded on 04.12.2014 were

suggested by the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents. The Counsel for the Plaintiff-

Appellant was present but he did not object to the terms of settlement suggested by the

Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents but he moved for a date to consider the same.

Subsequently, on 04.03.2015 the Plaintiff-Appellant, through his Counsel, indicated his

consent to the said settlerri.::nt. This there was consensus ad idem on 04.03.2015.

When a party to a case suggests a settlement which is accepted by the other party, that , becomes a settlement between the parties. Only when the other party does not agree to

the settlement suggested by the first party, it becomes a non-settlement. Section 408 of

the Civil Procedure Code is very clear on this point. Section 408 states as follows:-

uIf an action be adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise; or if the , defendant satiSfy the plhintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the matter of the action, such ,

agreement, compromise, or satisfaction shall be notifiedto the Court by motion made in presence

of, or on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court shall pass a decree in accordance there

with, so far as it relates to the action, and such decree shall be final, so far as relates toso much of

the subject-matter of the action as is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction."

A motion is necessary to ir.form the Court of the settlement arrived at by the parties only

I' when the settlement was r:iade outside the Court, but if it is made in the well of the court

) and in the present of the' judges, a motion is redundant. Furthermore, in this case the

settlement suggested by the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents had been recorded

by the Court in the presence of two Judges of this Court and the Counsel for the Plaintiff-

Appellant and the Defendant-Respondents and the settlement constitutes a part and

parcel of the record. It is the practice of our Courts that whenever a case is settled in open

t. Court, the parties may r~(iluest the presiding judge to record the terms of settlement and

to make an order or judgl11 ~ llt in terms of the settlement. That is why in this appeal too an

order on the question of settlement by Hon. Jayatilleke,J. was reserved for 02.04.2015 but

this order was never deliyered as the parties wanted to file written submissions;

5

II 'I

Considering the terms of settlement proposed by the Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondents on 04.12.2014 and the acceptance of those terms by the Plaintiff-Appellant

on 04.03.2015, as recorded; it is my considered view that there is a settlement that has been , . entered into between the parties. Though the Defendant-Respondents have taken a . different view or change.d their mind on the said settlement, the record cannot be . contradicted or controverted.

On a perusal of the Journal Entries in this case, it is recorded on 21.11.2014, in the presence

of two Judges of this Court: "Learned Counsel for the Appellant is on his feet. Both Counsel inform . court that this matter can bescrtled by way of a survey. Counsel for the Respondent makes an application

to consider the said settlement'find he needs to consult his client. To be resumed on 04.12.2014."

" This entry also clearly indicates an agreement between. the parties for a settlement of the

dispute and this settlement was notified to Court by the Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondents on 04.12.2014, and recorded.

It appears that on 21.11.20'14, the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents after Worming

of the settlement to Cburt, had moved for time to consult his clients and on this

application the case was pt,stponed for 04.12.2014. On 'that day it was the Counsel for the

Defendant-Respondents who informed Court that theywould accept the plan No.1512 and

so forth. All the details of the settlement were given byhim for the Court to record. It goes

without saying thdt a counsel acts on the instructions of his client and there is nothing to

gainsay that representations made to Court by Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents

were with the authority of his clients. After 04.12.2014 the case was postponed for . u . 19.01.2015 and 29.01.2015 Clfttd on both these two dates neither the Defendant-Respondents

por their Counsel inforrned Court about the wrong recording. Subsequently, the . '. Defendants-Respondents had revoked their proxy and retained a new Counsel, who on

l ., 04.03.2015 informed Court that the recording was wrong. It was thereafter that the matter , . went down for written submissions.

The question arises whe~her a party who agreed to' a settlement can resile from the , . settlement and challenge ,the entries in the record. This cannot be done. The Court may

i-,

6

presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed. (Vide Illustration (c)

I to Section 114 of the Evide!lce Ordinance).

In the case of Gunawardu le v. Keiaart, 48 N.LR. 522, a contention was advanced that

there was a discrepancy iIi the evidence recorded by the Magistrate compared with what a witness is alleged to ha~'e said in the witness-box. To establish this contention' Counsel

proposed to read the statement contained in an affidaVit sworn to by one of the junior

Counsel who appeared at the trial. Rejecting this contfntion, Canekeratne, J. held that the

Supreme Court would no~ admit affidaVits which seek 'to contradict the record kept by

the Magistrate. There is [If::' place for self-serVing affidaVits .

. -, the above decision is on all fours with the facts in the instant case. The said settlement ,

was not forced upon the parties. It was the parties who informed Court on 21.11.2014 that

the matter can be settled py way of a survey and Counsel for the Defendant-ReilPondents

needed time to consult .his clients, and the mattet ,was re-fixed to be res1,lmed on

04.12.2014, on which date, the terms of settlement were supplied by the Counsel for the

Oefendant-Respondents .t~ lr the Court to record. As the record speaks, the , terms of

settlement made on 04.12.7.014 were accepted by the Plaintiff-Appellant on 04.03.2015 and

, ' the matter must be treated as having been concluded thereat. The matter became finito.

, . . . Subsequently, the Defen~ant-Respondents by retaining a new Counsel cannot change

. i, ' J ~ their position and,seek to contradict the record. In my view this appears to be an after-

!". thought which cannot be allowed. As stated above, the settlement entered is proper and , . ; . ~ , . there is no irregularity or nppropriety in its recording ~n 04.12.2014.

When a settlement is efff-cted in Court, the parties are asked to sign the record as a

precaution. But there is no hard and fast rule that parties must sign the record. This

procedure is not a requirement under section 408 of the CiVil Procedure Code. Even if the

I ( , parties did not sign the record, the settlement would,be valid and effectual and bind all

parties to the settlement ,IS it is consensual ad idem.

In an earlier case of Silva,;l;" Hadjiar(1914) Bal. Notes of cases 7, parties had come to a

settlement and the termS: of settlement were drafted ' by the defendant's Counsel and

7

"

" . ,

) i accepted by the plaintiff's Counsel. A paper containing this draft was read in open Court

and assented to by the Counsel on both sides and the Judge made an order to the effect

that, "Let order be entered in accordance with the terms of the joint motion when filed".

The motion paper was not filed then and there. Subsequently, when the case was called,

the defendant's Counsel stated that he could not sign the joint motion as the defendant

has transferred his land to his son-in-law. The plaintiff then moved for judgment in his

favour and judgment wac accordingly entered. When the case went up in appeal, De

Sampayo,j. held that the court was entitled to enter updecree in terms of settlement under

section 408 of the Civil. Procedure Code. His Lordship further said: "In my opini?n section

408 of the Civil procedure Code was intended to provide an easy and inexpensive means

of giving effect to agreements of parties instead of driving them to separate actions for , . . specific performance. When a definite agreement is arrived at by them in reference to the o . matters involved in the a~tion, one of them is entitled to apply to Court to ertforce the

agreement even when the other objects to it. Unless this were so, the section would be

deprived of its full scope and meaning."

The above judgment is a clear authority which can be followed in the instant case. The

Defendant-Respondents who had agreed to settle the dispute on 04.12.2014 are estopped

from reneging or resiling from their avowed position later. The Plaintiff-Appellant has a

, I f right to move this Court to give effect to the settlement entered on 04.12.2014 inspite of

: . :. the objection of the Defendant-Respondents.

Finally, I wish to comment on the allegation that the Defendants-Respondents did not

instruct their Counsel to make some of the terms of settlement as recorded on 0:4.12.2014.

Jhis allegation sounds contrary to reason. Having stated that the matter can be settled by

way of a survey on 21.11.~ V.14, their Counsel moved for time to consult his clients and on

04.12.2014 dictated the te,lt'l'llS to be recorded. If he had not got the instructions from his

~lient, how did he narrate the details of the terms of settlement accurately? The

stenographer has no role to play in the terms of the settlement and therefore they cannot

blame the stenographer for the recording as stated in their written submission dated 3'd . . September, 2015.

~t is a recagnized principle in caurt proceedings that when a party ta a case gives a praxy

ta an Attorney-at-law, the Attorney has full authority ta act and take all steps .in the case

an behalf .of the party unti the proxy is cancelled or the Attorney dies. Whatever acts and

Steps taken by the Attarney are deemed ta be the acts ahd steps taken by the party. When

a Counsel is retained, he too acts in the same manner on the instruction of the registered

Attarney. In the instant case an Attarney appeared far the Defendants-Respondents and

his communicatian ta Caurt cannat be any less a. cammunicatian than from the , . ' Defendant-Respondents. :Nhen the Caurt sees an Attarney with the terms .of s~ttlement ,

it may be the hand .of Es<!ut that holds it, but we hear the voice .of J acab thraugh Tounsel, if

I may paraphrase that popular phrase. Hence, the acts dane by the Attorney on 04.12.2014 t ' kre deemed to be the acts dane by him on behalf .of the Defendant-Respondents.

Far the reasons stated abave, I hold that on 04.12.2014 a valid settlement had been entered

inta between the parties:which bind bath of them an9, Defendant-Respandents have na , legal right to go back an it, The judgment entered by the District Court .of Calambo dated

: . . 29th September 2000 is v<j.:ied. I remit the case back to the District Caurt to en,ter fresh

I ' I judgment in terms of the ~~ttlement entered inta before this Court an 04.12.2014.

The appeal is allawed.
