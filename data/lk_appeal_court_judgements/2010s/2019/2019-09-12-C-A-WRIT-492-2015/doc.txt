Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The cardboard boxes containing cigarettes without displaying

health warnings were seized and detained by the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents during transportation and storage on the basis

that such conduct violates section 34 of the National Authority

on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, No. 27 of 2006, as amended by Act

No. 3 of 2015. The Petitioner, Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC,

states that such seizure upon failure to display health warnings

on the cardboard boxes (which the Petitioner has named as

non-retail master cases) is a misconstruction of the said

section and also against the intention of the legislature, which is

3

to warn the end-user of the ill-effects of smoking. The Petitioner

has filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari quashing

the said seizure and detention of the boxes on that basis, and a

writ of prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent National

Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol and its officers including the

2nd and 3rd Respondents from such seizing, detaining, and

thereafter instituting and or continuing with any prosecution on

that basis.

According to the submissions made by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner and the Intervenient Petitioner, the

case is largely dependent upon the meaning given to the word

carton used in section 34 of the Act.

English text of Section 34, as it originally stood (before the

amendment), reads as follows:

34(1) A manufacturer of a tobacco product shall cause to be

displayed, conspicuously and in easily legible print, on

every packet containing tobacco products manufactured by

such manufacturer, a label of such dimensions as may be

prescribed containing a statement of the tar and nicotine

content in each tobacco product in such packet and such

health warnings as may be prescribed. Different

dimensions may be prescribed in respect of packets of

different sizes.

(2) A person shall not sell or offer for sale, a packet

containing tobacco products unless there is displayed on

such packet, a label of the prescribed dimensions

containing a statement of the tar and nicotine content in

4

each tobacco product in such packet and the prescribed

health warning.

(3) Any person who contravenes the provisions of

subsection (1) or subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence

under this Act, and shall on conviction after summary trial

before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding two

thousand rupees or to imprisonment for a period not

exceeding one year or to both such fine and imprisonment.

It is clear that this section speaks of manufacturing, selling and

offering for sale of only packets of tobacco products without

health warnings.

This section was repealed and replaced by the following section

by the amending Act No. 3 of 2015.

34(1) A manufacturer or an importer of a tobacco product

shall cause to be displayed conspicuously and in legible

print-

(a) on the top surface area of both front and back

sides of every packet, package or carton

containing the tobacco product manufactured or

imported by such manufacturer or importer, health

warnings, as may be prescribed, subject to the

provisions of section 34A; and

(b) on every packet, package or carton containing the

tobacco product manufactured or imported by

such manufacturer or importer, a label or a

statement specifying the tar and nicotine content

5

in each tobacco product in such packet, package

or carton.

(2) A person shall not sell, offer for sale, supply, distribute

or store a packet, package or carton containing tobacco

products unless health warnings as provided for in

subsection (1) (a) and a label or a statement as provided for

in subsection (1) (b), are displayed conspicuously in legible

print on every packet, package or carton containing the

tobacco products.

(3) Any person who contravenes the provisions of

subsection (1) or subsection (2), commits an offence and on

conviction after summary trial by a Magistrate be liable to a

fine not exceeding rupees fifty thousand or to an

imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding

one year or to both such fine and imprisonment.

Section 34A enacts in detail how to display health warnings.

Then it is seen that this amended section covers manufacturing,

importing, selling, offering for sale, supplying, distributing and

storing of packets, packages and cartons containing tobacco

products without health warnings.

It is important to realize that, after the 16th Amendment, Article

23 of the Constitution states that: All laws and subordinate

legislation shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala

and Tamil, together with a translation thereof in English. The

first proviso to that Article further states that: Parliament shall,

at the stage of enactment of any law determine which text shall

6

prevail in the event of any inconsistency between texts. Section

7 of the said amending Act, No. 3 of 2015, states that In the

event of any inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of

this Act, the Sinhala text shall prevail.

Then it is clear that the Law in this regard shall be understood

as it is stated in the Sinhala text, and not in the English text,

which is only a translation of the Sinhala text. The Act has

originally been enacted in Sinhala and Tamil languages. Hence it

is unnecessary to understand the meaning of the word carton

found in section 34 of the English text as that is how the word

found in section 34 of the Sinhala text has

been translated into English. If the English translation for

as carton is incorrect; instead of carton,

cardboard box or any other word or term can be used. In

short, the English word carton shall be understood by the

meaning given to the Sinhala word , and not

vice versa.

The Sinhala text of section 34 after the amendment (without

section 34A) reads as follows:

34(1)

(3) (1) (2)

It is abundantly clear that by the said amendment, the

legislature wanted to extend the display of health warnings from

packets, to packets, packages and cardboard boxes; and also to

expand the activities from manufacturing, selling and offering

for sale, to manufacturing, importing, selling, offering for sale,

supplying, distributing and storing. That means, after the

amendment, these cardboard boxes containing tobacco

8

products, which are used inter alia for storage and

transportation of packets of cigarettes shall contain health

warnings as prescribed in section 34 of the amending Act.

As the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has argued

that shall be understood as

, which is loosely called cigarette carton in duty free

shops, let me add the following. in this context

cannot be equalized to lightweight cardboard box. Although

packets of cigarettes can be sold and offered for sale in such

lightweight cardboard boxes, packets of cigarettes are not and

cannot practically stored and transported in such lightweight

cardboard boxes such as those used in duty free shops. Storage

and transportation of packets of cigarettes, as seen from R12

and R13, shall necessarily be in hard cardboard boxes.

When the words of an Act are clear, there is no necessity to go

into detail of the history of the law, the international conventions

relating to the same and to apply various theories of

interpretation of statutes to understand or to interpret the Law.

If the words are unambiguous, the Court shall give effect to the

plain words of the Statute. (Sanji Pararajasingham v. Devi

Pararajasingham [2006] 1 Sri LR 260 at 268-269)

The requirement or demand that cardboard boxes containing

tobacco products, which are used inter alia for storage and

transportation of packets of cigarettes, shall contain health

warnings as prescribed in section 34 of the amending Act is

completely in consonance with the purpose of the amending Act

and the intention of the legislature.
