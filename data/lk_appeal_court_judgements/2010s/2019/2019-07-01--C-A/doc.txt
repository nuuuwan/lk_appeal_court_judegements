27.08.2018

When this case was taken up for argument before this Court it was brought to the notice

of Court that the trial JUdge had not properly analyzed the evidence led before Court. In

the said circumstances Appellant informed Courts that there are serious errors in the

share list and hence the allotment of shares are erroneous. In the aforesaid situation to

Your Lordships' Court directed the parties to address on the calculation of the share list

and tender further written submission.

The 4th to 6th Defendant~ Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Appellants") have preferred this appeal to this Court against an order made by the

District Judge of Matara (In 09.07.1997 pertaining to an application made under Section

189 of the Civil Procedure Code in the above numbered partition case. Let me narrate the

background of the partitlctG case that has led to this appeal.

The Plaintiff~Respondent:) instituted the partition action bearing No.16307/P in the

District Court of Matara to partition a land called "Palliyagurugewatta" at

Kamburugamuwa described in the 2nd paragraph of the plaint (P37 of the brief).

The Plaintiff~ Respondent averred in his plaint that the said land contains an extent of

about 1 acre and the original owner was one Hewa Battage Coranelis who held it by

2

1

virtue of the deed 12060 d2:ted 16.01.1890. The devolution of title from Coranelis was also

elaborated by a pedigree~page 4 of the brief.

Only two statements of claims were filed by the Defendants out of which;

(i) rst, 2nd, yd, 7th, 8th, 9th and 12th defendant~Respondent have sailed with the

Plaintifr Respondent.

(ii) 4th, 5th and {;th defendant~Appeliants and 10th, lIth, 13th and 14th defendant~

Respondents thling a common statement of claims admitted the pedigree

described in the plaint.

(iii) Mr. A.D. Palihakkara Licensed Surveyor had prepared the preliminary plan

and his Plan bearing No.2087 dated 1993.12.20 and his report marked as Xl

were accepted by all the parties uncontested.

(iv)

I . As there was no contest over the pedigree and the preliminary plan, only

the Plaintiff's ~vidence was led in Courts. Thereafter the learned trial Judge

had delivered a judgment on 24.01.1995 for which he accepted the Plaintiff's

share list (PSI).

At a subsequent stage the Plaintiff as well as some Defendants having

observed that there was an error in calculation of the share list moved

Court to hokta fresh inquiry to rectify the errors. Both the Plaintiff and 4th,

yh and 6th Defendants tendered two separate share lists and the two lists

were not identical and hence it created an issue.

(v) The trial Judge though refused to hold a fresh inquiry pertaining to the

variance in the share lists, holding that he has no right to interfere with the

judgment of his predecessor.

It is thereafter the Appellants have preferred this appeal against the said

, order of the District Court of Matara delivered on 09.07.1997 (P63) which

the parties claimed is in the nature of a judgment.

3

(vi) When the appeal was taken up before this Court, the Court directed both

counsel to see whether the parties could calculate the correct share list and

come to a settlement. However they brought it to the attention of this Court

the following:

(a) the pedigree of the Plaintiff given in the plaint does not tally with the

eviderce led before Court thus disclosing a discrepancy;

(b) the evidence led before Courts, varies widely with the documentary

evidence (namely deeds before Courts).

Based on the above both'Counsel submitted that the learned Trial Judge had not

properly evaluated the evidence led before Courts. He has not properly indulged in an

analysis of documentary evidence by way of deeds tendered to Court and as a result, it

had become difficult to p,'epare a correct share list and hence the trial judge'S judgment

is erroneous which deserves to be quashed by this Court. Some of the serious errors in

the judgment are described below:~

(i) Errors in the pedigree

The Plaintiff avers in hls plaint that the original owner of the land to be partitioned

was one Hewabattage Coranelis who held the property by virtue of the deed bearing

No 12060 dated 1890. 01. 16.

It was contended that the Plaintiff failed to tender the aforesaid deed to Court.

Furthermore none of the deeds tendered to courts reveals that the original owner

was Coranelis.

(ii) Error in the dev0lution of title.

The Plaintiff avers in his plaint that the original owner had 5 children namely

Dauthis; Sisiliyana; Anagihamy alias Podihamy; Karalinahamy and Saradihamy.

However there was no documentary evidence to corroborate the said position.

It would then appear thct the oral evidence led by the Plaintiff~ Respondent cannot

corroborate the devolution of title given in the Plaintiff -Respondent's pedigree.

4

" .. I The learned Additional District Judge of Matara has failed to evaluated evidence

properly, there is no proper investigation of title and I proceed to set aside the judgement

dated 24.01.1995 and remit this case back to the District Court of Matara for a trial de novo

with a direction that the learned District Judge win give priority to this case and

conclude it as expeditiously as he could. He may consider all parties who wish to be

added and take all such evidence as is necessary in order to ensure due process for all

parties concerned.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
