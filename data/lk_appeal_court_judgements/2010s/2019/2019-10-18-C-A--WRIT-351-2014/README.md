Justice Janak De Silva

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is heard.

He draws the attention of Court to document marked P2 which contains the

inquiry proceedings into a complaint made by the 3

rd , 4th and 5th Respondents. It is

observed that the inquiry proceedings at P2, page 159 indicates that the inquiring

officer had adjourned the inquiry proceedings after acknowledging that the

Respondent party will further cross-examine the witness on the next date. However

without proceeding with the inquiry the inquiring officer by P3 dated 29.09.2014

made order evicting the 2nd Petitioner from the land in dispute. He submits that

there has been a breach of the rules of natural justice and further more he submits

that in any event in terms of Section 90 of Act No.46 of 2000 an order of eviction

cannot be made.

Learned Counsel for the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents acting in the best

traditions of the Bar informs that he will not be contesting the validity of the order

that has been made by P3 while reserving his rights in relation to any inquiry that

may take place on the complaint in the future.

Court having considered the submissions, factual matters and the relevant

legal provisions is of view that P3 is an order ultra vires the power of the inquiring

officer. Accordingly, we issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing P3.

3

r

We further direct the 1st Respondent to appoint a new inquiring officer to

continue the inquiry under reference from the point at which it was stopped as

reflected at Page 159 of P2.

We further direct that the inquiry be completed within a period of two

months from today. Court further requests the Hon. Attorney General to give

necessary instructions on the legal position in relation to inquiries of this nature to

the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development.

Subject to the foregoing application is allowed to the extent set out above. No

costs.

Justice N. Bandula Karunarathna

I agree.
