Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Charaka Jayaratne for the Petitioner.

S.A. Parathalingam, P.C., with Nishkan

Parathalingam for the 1st-5th Respondents.

Indula Ratnayake, S.C., for the 6th and 7th

Decided on: 22.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by writ of

certiorari P12 whereby the 1st respondent (The Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka) informed the petitioner that it would no

longer act upon the decision made by P5. By P5 the 1st

respondent informed the petitioner the decision of the former to

grant the land relevant to this application on lease to the latter

to construct and operate a cafeteria subject to conditions and

subject to entering into a formal Agreement. The petitioner also

seeks to compel the 1st respondent by writ of mandamus to

enter into the said Lease Agreement; and to prevent the 1st

respondent by writ of prohibition from obstructing the right of

the petitioner to construct and operate a cafeteria in the land.

The petitioner rests his case on legitimate expectation.

To expect relief on legitimate expectation, the petitioner shall

first prove that he acted legitimately. The act which he expects

the respondent to perform on the said basis shall undoubtedly

be a lawful act and not an unlawful act.

The respondents in their objections have convinced Court that

P5 has not been issued following the established state

procurement procedure, but done in an ad hoc manner in order

to favour the petitioner. The respondents point out that no

tenders were called and the petitioner was just handpicked

exerting undue influence on the then Board. Thereafter the new

Board has assigned that task of constructing and operating a

cafeteria to another party following the proper procedure.

The petitioner has merely denied them in the counter affidavit.

I must stress that notwithstanding several dates were obtained,

no written submissions were filed on behalf of the petitioner in

pursuance of his application. It appears that the petitioner is

not keen to pursue this application in the present

circumstances.

In the facts and circumstances of this application, no public law

remedies can be granted on legitimate expectation.

On the other hand, the subject matter of this application

eminently falls within the sphere of private law and not public

law. If the petitioner thinks that the 1st respondent violated P5

Agreement by P12, he shall seek relief under private law.

In Jayaweera v. Wijeratne [1985] 2 Sri LR 413 this Court held

that:

Where the relationship between the parties is a purely

contractual one of a commercial nature neither certiorari nor

mandamus will lie to remedy grievances arising from an

alleged breach of contract or failure to observe the

principles of natural justice even if one of the parties is a

public authority.

In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte [1984] 1 Sri

LR 195 at 199 a Full Bench of the Supreme Court stated:

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty,

in the performance of which an applicant has sufficient

legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus the duty to

be performed must be of a public nature and not of merely

private character.

4

The Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say

for the enforcement of a mere private duty stemming from a

contract or otherwise. Contractual duties are enforceable by

the ordinary contractual remedies such as damages,

specific performance or injunction. They are not enforceable

by Mandamus which is confined to public duties and is not

granted where there are other adequate remedies.

In Gawarammana v. The Tea Research Board [2003] 3 Sri LR 120

it was held that:

Powers derived from contract are matter of private law. The

fact that one of the parties to the contract is a public

authority is not relevant since the decision sought to be

quashed by way of certiorari is itself was not made in the

exercise of any statutory power.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
