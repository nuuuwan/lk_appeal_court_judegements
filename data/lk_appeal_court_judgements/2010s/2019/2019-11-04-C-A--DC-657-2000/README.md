Janak De Silva, J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kegalle dated 23.06.2000.

The Plaintiffs-Respondents (Plaintiffs) instituted the above styled action in the District Court of

Kegalle seeking inter alia to partition Lot B1 of Hitinawatta containing in extent A.0-R.0-P.34.5

more fully described in the schedule to the plaint dated 05.02.1991. The Plaintiffs averred in their

plaint that-

1. The original owner of the said Lot B1 was W. Dingiri Appuhamy;

2. Under and by virtue of Deed No. 19369 dated 21.07.1925 ( ~, .2), Appuhamy and

Punchirala became entitled to the said Lot B1;

3. Appuhamy transferred his share to Punchirala by Deed No. 21757 dated 22.09.1927 ( ~, .3)

who transferred it back to Appuhamy by Deed No. 4642 dated 30.10.1942 ( ~, .4);

4. Appuhamy again transferred his share to Punchirala by Deed No. 204 dated 17.11.1945

( ~, .5) who later conveyed it back to Appuhamy by Deed No. 560 dated 20.02.1952 ( ~, .l);

5. Under and by virtue of Deed No. 3359 dated 26.11.1964 ( ~, .6), Lucy Nona (1st Plaintiff),

Punchi Nona and Albin Nona became entitled to Appuhamy's share;

6. By Deed No. 2548 dated 10.12.1990 ( ~, .8), Punchi Nona and Albin Nona conveyed their

shares to the 1st Plaintiff who transferred 1/12 share of her title and the tile roofed house

to the 2nd Plaintiff by Deed No. 9650 dated 25.09.1990 ( ~, .7);

7. Appuhamy and the 2nd Plaintiff built the said tile roofed house in 1975 and Appuhamy

lived there till his death in 1985;

Page 2 of 11

8. The said tile roofed house was partly built on the land belonging to R. G. Podi Singho and

in terms of the settlement of Case No. 720/B, Appuhamy paid Rs. 200/- to said R. G. Podi

Singho who transferred 456 sq. ft. (on which the house was partly built) to Appuhamy;

9. Subsequent to Punchirala's demise, his title devolved to his children (1st - 6th Defendants).

Accordingly, the Plaintiffs prayed the said Lot B1 to be partitioned among the parties to the action

in the following manner-

1st Plaintiff Undivided 2/12 and 2/3 of 456 sq. ft.

2nd Plaintiff Undivided 1/12 and 1/3 of 456 sq. ft.

1st Defendant Undivided 1/24

2nd Defendant Undivided 1/24

3rd Defendant Undivided 1/24

4th Defendant Undivided 1/24

5th Defendant Undivided 1/24

6th Defendant Undivided 1/24

The Defendants-Appellants (Defendants) filed their statement of claim on 08.11.1991 and took

up the position that-

1. Punchirala became entitled to the entire Lot B1 under and by virtue of Deed No. 204

dated 17.11.1945 (el.5);

2. After his demise, the 1st - 6th Defendants became entitled to the said Lot B1;

3. Punchirala never transferred his title to Appuhamy as stated in paragraph 4 of the plaint

[i.e. he never executed Deed No. 560 dated 20.02.1952 (el.1)].

A commission was issued to survey the land to be partitioned. Accordingly, Plan No. 43/91 dated

19.07.1991 made by H. M. T. B. Samarasinghe, Licensed Surveyor [Page 121 of the Appeal Brief]

and the Surveyor's Report [Page 123 of the Appeal Brief] were produced and the Licensed

Surveyor has identified Lot 1 of the said Plan No. 43/91 as Lot B1 of Hitinawatta (i.e. the land to

be partitioned).

After a lengthy trial, the learned District Judge held that the land to be partitioned is depicted as

Lot 1 in the said Plan No. 43/91 and the said Lot 1 (Lot B1 of Hitinawatta) should be partitioned

in the following manner -

1st Plaintiff

2nd Plaintiff

Not allotted

Undivided 2/12

Undivided 4/12

Undivided 6/12

Being aggrieved, the Defendants appealed.

Page 3 of 11

In a partition case, it is incumbent on the judge to investigate into title of each party before he

arrives at a determination [Chandrasena v. Piyasena and Others (1999) 3 Sri.L.R. 201] and it would

be the prime duty of the trial judge to carefully examine and investigate the actual rights and

titles to the land sought to be partitioned [Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi and Twa Others (2010) 1

Sri.L.R. 87]. Although there is a duty cast on the court to investigate title in a partition action, the

court can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both

documentary and oral. The court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding

the shares in the corpus for them [Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan and Others (1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 66].

According to '~l.2' [Page 139 of the Appeal Brief], W. Dingiri Appuhamy transferred an undivided

y, share of Hitinawatta and the thatched house situated thereon to Appuhamy and Punchirala.

Then, Appuhamy transferred his undivided X share of Hitinawatta together with an undivided Y,

share of the thatched house to Punchirala by ' ~l. 3' [Page 142 of the Appeal Brief]. Accordingly,

Punchirala became entitled to an undivided Y, share of Hitinawatta and to the thatched house

situated thereon.

By '~l.4' [Page 146 of the Appeal Brief], Punchirala transferred "an undivided Y, share of Lot B1

out ofthe land called Hitinawatta of Thirty-four and Half Perches (A.0-R.0-P.34Y,) in extent with

a like share of the house standing thereon" to Appuhamy.

It is clear, by the wording of '~l .4', that Lot B1 is a defined portion of Hitinawatta and it contains

Thirty-four and Half Perches (A.0-R.0-P.34.5) in extent. Also, an inference can be gathered by the

contents of '~l.4' that Lot B1 is the undivided Y, share of Hitinawatta transferred to Appuhamy

and Punchirala by '~l.2'.

Therefore, I hold that what Punchirala transferred by '~l.4' is not an undivided Y, share of

Hitinawatta but an undivided Y, share of Lot B1 of Hitinawatta. Accordingly, Appuhamy became

entitled to an undivided Y, share of Lot B1 and an undivided Y, share of the house.

Then, by '~l.5' [Page 148 of the Appeal Brief], Appuhamy again transferred "an undivided Y, share

of Lot B1 out of the land called Hitinawatta of Thirty-four and Half Perches (A.0-R.0-P.34Y,) in

extent with a like share of the house standing thereon" to Punchirala. As a result, Punchirala

became the sole owner of Lot B1 and the house.

According to paragraph 4 ofthe plaint, by Deed No. 560 dated 20.02.1952 [Page 135 of the Appeal

Brief], Punchirala transferred an undivided Y, share of Lot B1 and everything else standing thereon

(cyt:l@2S"! ~w (IE) q815l @(l)Jt:lZl)l61~ qJ~ 8(.)~ @~82S"! @Zl)J@@~ @~@2:i)2S"! ooCQ1) ~ ) to Appuhamy. But

the Defendants denied the execution of the said Deed No. 560 and claimed the sole ownership

of Lot B1 [5th paragraph of the statement of claim].

Page 4 of 11

Therefore, it is essential to consider whether Punchirala transferred an undivided Y, share of Lot

B1 and everything else standing thereon to Appuhamy by the said Deed No. 560 and whether the

learned District Judge was correct in holding that the said Deed No. 560 is admissible in evidence.

Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance reads-

"Where any dacument purparting or praved to be thirty years aid is produced from any

custody which the court in the particular case considers proper, the court may presume that

the signature and every other part of such document which purports to be in the handwriting

of any particular person is in that person's handwriting and in the case of a document executed

or attested, that it was duly executed and attested by the persons by whom it purports to be

executed and attested."

The presumption laid down in Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance recognizes two essential

preconditions for it to apply.

1. The document must be at least thirty years old; and

2. It must be produced from proper custody.

Accordingly, the document must "purport or be proved to be thirty years old". E. R. S. R.

Coomaraswamy in the Law of Evidence (Page 150 of Vol. II - Book 1, 2nd Edition) states that what

is meant by 'purporting' is 'stating itselfto be'. It assumes that the document was in existence for

thirty years. The period of thirty years is to be reckoned, not from the date on which the deed is

filed in the court, but from the date on which, it having been tendered in evidence, its

genuineness or otherwise becomes the subject of proof.

On the face of it, the said Deed No. 560 was executed on 20.02.1952 whereas the instant action

was instituted on 05.02.1991. The execution of the said Deed No. 560 was denied by the

Defendants by their statement of claims dated 08.11.1991.

Whether or not a particular custody is proper is a question of fact to be determined in the

circumstances of each case [Davoodbhoy v. Farook (58 N.L.R.126)]. A duplicate of a deed over

thirty years old produced from the office of the Registrar General is admissible in evidence

without further proof; it must be held to have been produced from proper custody within the

meaning of Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance. A duplicate cannot be treated as a copy of the

original deed; it is in all respects an original deed [Kirimenika v. Duroya et al (17 N.L.R. 11)].

Page 5 of 11

A careful perusal of the evidence shows that the Land Registrar of Kegalle was summoned to give

evidence regarding the said Deed No. 560. A clerk from the Kegalle Land Registry has produced

the duplicate of the said Deed No. 560 to the court. However, the duplicate was not marked in

evidence but a certified copy was marked in evidence as 'e,.l'. The clerk compared 'e,.l' with

the duplicate and admitted that 'e,.l' is a certified copy of the said Deed No. 560.

In view of the above, I hold that the said Deed No. 560 fulfills the preconditions laid down is

Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance. The question to be considered now is whether the learned

District Judge was correct in holding that 'e,.l' is admissible in evidence.

The presumption of due execution of a dead thirty years old may be drawn under Section 90 of

the Evidence Ordinance, only upon production of the very document in regard to which the court

is invited to draw such presumption. The production of a copy, even if it is a certified copy, is not

sufficient [Dingiri Appu v. Mohottihamy (68 N.L.R. 40)].

In Dingiri Appu v. Mohottihamy (supra), the original of the deed was at no time produced before

the trial judge (Judge Wijayatilake) or his successor who decided the case. The duplicate of the

deed was produced before Judge Wijayatilake by a clerk from the Land Registry and it was taken

back. His successor (the one who delivered the judgment) only had a certified copy before him to

base his conclusions on.

However, in the instant action, the duplicate was brought to the court by the clerk from the Land

Registry who compared it with the certified copy of the said Deed No. 560 which was marked in

evidence as 'e,.l ' before the same judge who later delivered the judgment dated 23.06.2000.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in the Law of Evidence (Page 153 of Vol. 11- Book 1, 2nd Edition) states

the court is not bound to draw the presumption laid down in Section 90 of the Evidence

Ordinance. The presumption is not a compulsory one, and the words, "may presume" show that

there is no direction to draw the presumption. The court may, therefore, require the document

to be proved in the ordinary way, as by calling a witness. If the court considers that there are

suspicious features which throw great doubt on the genuineness of the document, the court may

exercise its discretion in the matter and refuse to admit the document, unless formal proof is

given, even though it was produced from proper custody.

Page 6 of 11

It is clear that the learned District Judge had the discretion to draw the presumption laid down in

Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance. If the duplicate produced by the clerk of the Land Registry

had suspicious features, the learned District Judge had ample opportunity to refuse to admit

'el.1' as admissible evidence. But being satisfied as to the genuineness of the duplicate produced

by the clerk of the Land Registry, the learned District Judge allowed to mark 'el.1' in evidence

after it was duly compared with the duplicate produced.

Therefore, I hold that 'el.1' being a certified copy of the duplicate of the said Deed No. 5GO

produced before the judge who decided the case attracts the presumption laid down in Section

90 of the Evidence Ordinance and the learned District Judge was correct in holding that 'el.1' is

admissible in evidence.

Under and by virtue of 'el.1', Appuhamy became entitled to an undivided Y, share of Lot B1 and

everything else standing thereon. Accordingly, it is safe to conclude that he became entitled to

an undivided Y, share of the house as well.

Thereafter, 'el.G' was executed by Appuhamy by which he transferred an undivided Y. of

Hitinawatta to the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent (1st Plaintiff), Punchi Nona and Albin Nona. 'el.G' was

admitted in evidence without any objections.

The Defendants contend that what Appuhamy transferred by 'el.G' is not the undivided Y, share

of Lot B1 he got by virtue of 'el.G' but an undivided Y. share of Hitinawatta and therefore, the

Plaintiffs are not entitled to partition Lot B1 of Hitinawatta to which the Plaintiffs have no

entitlement [Page 2 of the Written Submissions dated 12.02.2014]. However, it must be noted

that this contention of the Defendants was never put before the learned District Judge during the

trial.

A careful perusal of the evidence given by the 2nd Plaintiff shows that what Appuhamy transferred

by 'el.G' is his entitlement to Hitinawatta [Pages G1 - G2 and Page 7G of the Appeal Brief].

According to the wording of 'el.G', Appuhamy got entitled to what he transferred to the 1st

Plaintiff, Punchi Nona and Albin Nona by a deed not produced before the Notary who attested

'el.G'. In that event, it is clear that what Appuhamy intended to transfer is the undivided Y, of Lot

B1 to which he became entitled under and by virtue of 'el. 1'. Thus, I hold that the 1st Plaintiff,

Punchi Nona and Albin Nona became entitled to an undivided l/G share of Lot B1 each under and

by virtue of 'el.G'.

Then, by 'el.7', the 1st Plaintiff transferred an undivided 1/12 share of Hitinawatta to the 2nd

Plaintiff. 'el.7' was also admitted in evidence without any objections. However, it is clear, by the

wording of 'el.7', that what the 1st Plaintiff transferred to the 2nd Plaintiff is what she became

Page 7 of 11

entitled to by virtue of 'el.6' (i.e. an undivided 1/6 share of Lot B1). This was admitted by the 2nd

Plaintiff in his evidence [Pages 76 - 77 of the Appeal Brief]. In view of the above, I hold that the

2nd Plaintiff became entitled to an undivided 1/6 share of Lot B1 under and by virtue of 'el .7'.

By 'el.8', which was admitted in evidence without any objections, Punchi Nona and Albin Nona

transferred what they became entitled to under 'el.6' to the 1st Plaintiff. Accordingly, I hold that

the 1st Plaintiff became entitled to an undivided 1/3 share of Lot B1.

Therefore, I hold that Lot B1 of Hitinawatta and the tile roofed house standing thereon should be

partitioned among the parties to the action in the following manner-

1st Plaintiff Undivided 2/6

2nd Plaintiff Undivided 1/ 6

1st - 6th Defendants Undivided 3/ 6

(being the heirs of Punchirala)

The Defendants further urged that the learned District Judge has misdirected herself that the

Plaintiffs only sought to partition Lot 1 whereas no party has sought to exclude any portion of the

surveyed land which consists of Lots 1 and 2 of the said Plan No. 43/91.

In a partition action, there is a duty cast on the judge to satisfy him as to the identity of the land

sought to be partitioned [Jayasuriya v. Ubaid (61 N.L.R. 352)] and there are certain duties cast on

the court quite apart from objections that mayor may not be taken by the parties. In addition to

the duty that is cast on the court to resolve the disputes that are set out by the parties in their

issues, the court has a supervening duty to satisfy itself as to the identity of the corpus and also

as to the title of each and every party who claims title to it [Wickremaratne and Another v. A/penis

Perera (1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 190]. Without proper identification of the corpus it would be impossible

to conduct a proper investigation of title [Sopinona V. Pitipanoarachchi (2010) 1 Sri.L.R. 87].

According to the plaint, the Plaintiffs sought to partition Lot B1 of Hitinawatta. By their statement

of claim on 08.11.1991, the Defendants also admitted that the land to be partitioned is Lot B1 of

Hitinawatta.

As I observed earlier, a commission was issued to survey the land to be partitioned. H. M. T. B.

Samarasinghe, Licensed Surveyor who prepared Plan No. 43/ 91 dated 19.07.1991 accordingly has

recognized Lot 1 of the said Plan No. 43/91 as th e land to be partitioned [Page 121 and Page 124

of the Appeal Brief].

Page 8 of 11

Even though there is a minor discrepancy in extent, the learned District Judge has decided Lot 1

of the said Plan No. 43/91 to be the land to be partitioned (i.e. Lot B1 of Hitinawatta). The learned

District Judge has based her conclusions on the fact that the boundaries of Lot 1 of the said Plan

No. 43/91 tally with the boundaries of Lot B1 of Hitinawatta.

Identifying a land by its boundaries has been the practice for a long period of time and I am of

the opinion that it can still be considered as a valid method in identifying lands. Therefore, I agree

with the finding of the learned District Judge that Lot 1 of the said Plan No. 43/91 and Lot B1 of

Hitinawatta are the same land.

Also, if the portion of land is clearly described and can be precisely ascertained, a mere

inconsistency in extent will not affect the question of identity [Gabriel Perera v. Agnes Perera (43

c.loW. 82, Yapa v. Dissanayake Sedara (1989) 1 Sri.loR. 361]. Since the land to be partitioned can

clearly be identified by the said Plan No. 43/91 as well as by the boundaries, I hold that the minor

discrepancy in extent can be disregarded.

For all the foregoing reasons, I allow this appeal to the extent set out above and answer the issues
