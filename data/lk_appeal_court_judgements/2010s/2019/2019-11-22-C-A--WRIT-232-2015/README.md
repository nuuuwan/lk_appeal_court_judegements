Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner company (Sri Lanka Telecom PLC) filed this

application seeking to quash, by way of writ of certiorari, the

documents marked P9 and P11, whereby the Commissioner of

Labour decided that the respondent debt collectors of the

petitioner company are employees of the petitioner (as opposed

to independent contractors) for the purpose of payment of

Employment Provident Fund contributions.

Notwithstanding a number of tests, such as, the control test, the

integration test, the economic reality test, mutuality of obligation

test, dominant impression test, have been formulated in order

to decide whether a person is an employee or an independent

contractor, there is no conclusive test which could answer that

question; and therefore, that question shall ultimately be

answered on a case by case basis taking into consideration the

unique facts and circumstances of each individual case.1

In this process, the labels given or terminology used are not

binding. They are, more often than not, misleading. For

instance, a clause in the appointment letter expressly stating

that the appointment shall never be considered as creating an

employer-employee relationship with the establishment which

issued the letter, and accepting the appointment by the

employee subject to that condition is not decisive. To give

another example, the label given for the payment for the work

executed, as allowance, commission, incentive,

compensation etc. instead of salary, is not crucial.2 The

employee is the weaker party who has no bargaining power. He

has to succumb to the conditions of the employer. That may be

why, as the petitioner laments, overly rigorous application of

labour laws of this country3 or anywhere in the world.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, in my view, there is

an employer-employee relationship between the petitioner

company and the debt collectors of the petitioner company. In

other words, the relationship between the petitioner and the 5th-

29th respondents is one of a contract of services (workmen) and

not contract for services (independent contractors).

Let me now give reasons for the said conclusion.

1. The petitioner advertised in newspapers for the Post of

Debt Recovery Officer whose job is to visit the telephone

subscribers premises and collect dues from them for a

payment of commission of 2% out of collection with

reimbursement of travelling expenses.4

Their job in short was to recover debts from defaulting

customers of the Sri Lanka Telecom whose services have

been disconnected.

In the Agreements later entered, which I will refer to later,

this commission has been increased/amended in the

following manner: 6.5% commission, if collected within

4

two months from the date of the job assigned; 5%, if

collected within four months; and no percentage beyond

four months.

2. They have been selected for the said post after an

interview.5

3. They have been issued with Company Identity Cards.6

4. However, they were not given a Letter of Appointment for

the Post of Debt Recovery Officer as advertised, in the

conventional sense, but given a letter of assignment of job

wise basis upon being nominated as a Debt Collector.7

Vide the Agreement for Collection of Debt marked 1R8,

P2(1)-(y). It appears that the petitioner had been very

careful in selecting words to be used in this Agreement.

I must mention that, as I stated at the outset, the

terminologyAgreement, Appointment etc. is beside

the point. The point is whether or not they are workmen

under the petitioner in the eyes of the Labour Law.

5. In paragraph 10 of this Agreement, it is expressly stated

that This agreement should not be interpreted at any

time as a contract of employment. In my view, the

inclusion of such a clause, shows the guilty mind on the

5 Vide 6R1(a), 1R15. 6 Vide 6R2, 1R7. 7 However, I find that the 10th respondent has inter alia filed an Appointment Letter marked 6R1 with the amended petition and affidavit both dated 16.10.2017, as I understand, without notice to the petitioner. Therefore I refrain from using it against the petitioner.

part of the employer. Such clauses are misleading and

not binding.

6. In my view, this Agreement has most of the

characteristics/attributes of a Letter of Appointment,

which establishes employer-employee relationship. It has

inter alia:

(i) A commencing date and ending date of the

job. That is, the job is for a period of six

months, one year or two years. That means,

there is a fixed period of employment.

(ii) It says the payment method or how the

employee is remunerated for the job. The

petitioner states that In the case of a

workman there is a guaranteed payment

monthly.8 Although there is no fixed monthly

amount payable, there is a fixed method of

calculation of the amount payable by the

employer to the employee on monthly basis or

otherwise. There was an ascertainable

salary/wage.

(iii) It contains directions on how he shall perform

the job.9

8 Vide paragraph 56 at page 20 of the written submissions of the petitioner. 9 Vide clauses 5 and 6.

6

(iv) The appointees shall make an initial

refundable deposit as security albeit it is a

negligible amount.10

(v) Either party can terminate the Agreement by

giving one months notice.11

(vi) However, if the employee does not discharge

his duties to the satisfaction of the employer,

the employer has the authority to terminate

the services forthwith without one months

notice.12

If this is a job by job wise assignment, why

termination clauses?

The inclusion of a clause that the payments

over Rs.50,000/= are after the deductions of

5% for withholding tax will not negate the

presence of an employer-employee

relationship.13 The decision to deduct in the

form of withholding tax or PAYE tax is on

the employer and not the employee. Broadly

speaking, PAYE tax is also a withholding tax

on income payments to employees.

10 Vide clause 7. 11 Vide clause 8. 12 Vide clause 9. 13 Vide clause 4.

7. Letter marked 6R5 sent to the 14th respondent debt

collector is revealing. It inter alia reads as follows:

It has been noticed that you have not

performed your duties up to the satisfactory

level. Especially success rate of the defaulted

files and monthly collections from the defaulted

customers are far below from the given targets.

Hence hereby strictly advice you to improve

your performance up to the expected levels

immediately.

If you are not in a position to achieve said

performance level, your contract will be

terminated according to the terms and

conditions of the contract without further

notice.

If the debt collectors are independent contractors, who are

paid job by job basis, how can the petitioner send this

type of a warning letter reprimanding termination of

contract?

This goes to suggest that the work performed is integral to

the employers business.

8. The petitioner has taken disciplinary actions against the

debt collectors who were found to have acted negligently in

the discharge of their services. Vide 6R5(a) sent to the 8th

respondent whereby the 8th respondent has been asked by

the petitioner to show cause in writing before a given date

why disciplinary action shall not be taken against him.

8

No disciplinary actions can be taken against independent

contractors.

This also goes to show that they work under the control

and direction of the employer and not independently.

9. They have been given detailed instructions on how to

recover debts on installment basis.14

10. They have also been given training on how to

perform their duties.15 Only employees receive training for

performing services in a particular manner. Conversely,

independent contractors bring specialized expertise or

skills to the employer.

11. Dress code for the casual day, being every Friday,

has been made applicable to debt collectors as the other

employees. T-shirts with company logo issued to the

employees of the plaintiff company, have been issued to

these debt collectors.16

12. The debt collectors have been authorized to

represent the petitioner company before statutory bodies

such as Mediation Boards set up under the Mediation

Boards Act.

Vide 6R8 where the 16th respondent has been authorized

to attend the Mediation Board in relation to recovery of

14 Vide 1R13. 15 Vide 1R16. 16 Vide 6R7 containing 4 pages.

some dues on behalf of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, which is

the petitioner.

As seen from 1R11, the 19th respondent has been

authorized to take decisions on our (Sri Lanka Telecom

PLC) default cases to the Mediation Board.

As seen from page 2 of 1R11, the 19th respondent has

signed the Certificate of Settlement on behalf of Sri Lanka

Telecom PLC.

An independent contractor will not be authorized to

represent Sri Lanka Telecom PLC.

13. The debt collectors have been assigned specific days

in the week to be present at the petitioner company in a

roster.17

That is akin to Fiscal officers (process servers) working in

Courts reporting for duty on specific days in a roster due

to the nature of their job.

14. As seen from 1R10, the petitioner has maintained

an Attendance Register for the debt collectors. The

argument that 1R10 has been kept at the Metro Office as

a record of the Debt Collectors visiting that particular

office, for security purposes only is unacceptable because

there appears to be no such requirement for other visitors

(such as customers/defaulters).

17 Vide 1R9.

10

15. The debt collectors have been given a travel

allowance and a phone allowance.18

16. The debt collectors have participated in annual

events and activities of the welfare association of the

petitioner company.19

17. Their services have been appreciated and awards

have been presented at official award ceremonies held in

Five Star Hotels in Colombo.20 This shows the continuity

of relationship with the employer.

18. Service Certificates have been issued to them by the

administrative officer of the petitioner company stating

that they have been employed in the petitioner company

on commission basis.21

The petitioner has tendered P8(a)-(k) to say that some of the debt

collectors who initially complained to the Commissioner of

Labour for failure to pay EPF contributions have later given

letters to the petitioner to say that they are not employees of the

petitioner. In reply, they have filed affidavits to say that they

were coerced into giving those letters, and they obliged to it in

fear of losing the employment.22 This shows mala fide intention

of the employer.

18 Vide paragraph 12 of the counter affidavit. 19 Vide 1R17, 6R4, 6R4(a), 6R4(b). 20 Vide 6R3-6R3(c). 21 Vide 6R3(d). 22 Vide 6R9-6R9(d), 1R20-1R23.

11

The petitioner complains that there was no fair hearing before

reaching the impugned decision, in that no proper inquiry where

parties could lead evidence and cross-examine the witnesses of

the opposite party was held before the Labour Commissioner.

As seen from P3, P4, 1R3-1R6, an inquiry with the participation

of both parties has been held by the Labour Commissioner

wherein, on behalf of the petitioner company, as seen from page

2 of 1R6, four very senior officers of the petitioner company with

another two lawyers (the first of whom is an amiable and able

senior counsel) have participated. According to page 1 of 1R6,

senior counsel for the petitioner has invited the inquiring officer

to dispose of the inquiry by way of written submissions together

with documents if any, as the question to be decided was

whether the debt collectors are employees or independent

contractors under the petitioner company. As seen from P6,

written submissions together with documents have been

tendered to the Labour Commissioner on behalf of the petitioner.

There had not been a legal representation for the debt collectors

and they had been undefended. Hence no inquiry was held and

therefore the impugned decision was taken without giving a fair

hearing is unacceptable. I totally reject the argument of the

petitioner that the written submissions were tendered with the

expectation that the petitioner would later be permitted to

present its case fully.23

23 Vide page 4 of the written submissions of the petitioner. Cf. page 1 of 1R6.

12

The ages of the debt collectors when they were recruited,

whether they were full-time employees or part-time employees

etc. are irrelevant for the purpose of payment of EPF

contributions.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner but without costs.
