o l. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Kurunegala with one count of Grave Sexual Abuse on Walisundera

Mudiyanselage Kasun Prabhath (Victim), punishable in terms of section 365

b(2)b of the Penal Code. Upon conviction after trial, Appellant was

sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a fine ofRs. 25,0001-, in default

imprisonment for 6 months.

02. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant appealed

against the same on the following grounds. (Grounds as mentioned in

written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellant dated 28th February

2018).

2

1. Thc learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the intrinsic

intimlities of the prosecution case and the said failure vitiates the said

judgment, conviction and sentence.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that a complaint had

been lodged in this regard at the police station of Rasnayakepura three

months after the alleged incident and there was absolutely no medical

evidence to establish the charge.

3. The said judgment and conviction are contrary to law and the weight of

evidence and hence, are completely unreasonable and unjustified as the

learned High Court Judge has failed to conclude that there was no

evidence warranting the conviction of the Appellant for the prosecution

has failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.

4. In the circumstances, the said judgment, conviction, and sentence have

occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice.

03. Case for the prosecution is mainly dependent on the evidence of the victim

Kasun Prabhath. According to the victim's evidence he had been living with

his grandmother and aunt. Appellant had been the priest of the temple that

his family had a close relationship with. At the time relevant to the incident

Kasun had been 13 years of age. He had gone to the temple on his way to

school to offer breakfast 'Dane' to the priest who was the Appellant. They

used to give 'Dane' to the temple on the 22nd day of every month.

3

04. When he was serving 'Dane' from the basket, the Appellant had closed the

door behind. He had tried to scream when Appellant had tried to remove his

clothes. Appellant had threatened him not to shout pointing a knife at him.

After removing his clothes, Appellant had put a cloth on the bed, spat on his

thighs and had got on to him. Appellant had put his penis between his thighs

and had moved up and down. Then he has wiped what he ejaculated and had

told him not to tell anyone. Victim had then gone to school.

05. Grounds 1, 3 and 4 will be dealt together as they are based on the same

footing. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the victim had made the

complaint to the police 3 months after the alleged incident. According to

Nadeesha (Victim's aunt) she had come home after August 2005 from

Trincomalee. Counsel submitted that Nadeesha's claim that the complaint

was made within few days after she became aware of the incident is

untenable.

06. Counsel further submitted that as the Vesak lantern competition had taken

place few days after the alleged sexual abuse according to the victim, and as

Vesak falls in the month of May, the alleged offence could not have taken

place on 22nd June 2005 as claimed by the prosecution.

07. The victim had been l3 years of age at the time of the alleged incident. By

the time he testified in Court he was 23 years old. Court will have to

consider his evidence in that context. It is evident that the tum to offer

'Dane' to the temple comes on the 22nd day of every month. Clearly, the

counsel for the defence has put confusing questions to the victim in cross

examination as to the time of the alleged sexual assault. Counsel had tried to

show that the lantern competition was held for Vesak in May. However, the

victim in re-examination has clarified that displaying lanterns and making

4

horror houses were to collect money to the temple and not necessarily in

May during Vesak.

08. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that although a knife was listed in the

indictment, it was not produced in court. It was submitted further, that the

medical report does not support the case for the prosecution. The sexual act

the Appellant had performed on the victim would not necessarily cause

physical injuries to the victim. However, the short history given by the

victim to the doctor shows the consistency of the evidence of the victim.

09. It is the Trial Judge who has the opportunity to observe the demeanour and

deportment of the witness who testifies before him. The learned Trial Judge

has properly analyzed all the evidence placed before him by the prosecution

and the defence. He has given good and sufficient reasons for accepting the

evidence of the victim. He has taken all the infirmities into consideration

when he found the victim a witness trustworthy of credit. The learned Trial

Judge also has rightly disregarded the contradictions marked as VI and V2

as they do not go to the root of the matter and would not have any adverse

effect on the testimonial trustworthiness of the victim.

10. In the circumstances, the grounds of appeal no. 1, 3 and 4. should fail.

Ground 2.

11. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Trial Judge failed to

consider that the complaint by the victim to the police was made after a

delay of about 3 months. Victim in evidence said that he told his uncle about

the incident after about 15 days. Then the uncle had told that to her aunt.

After the incident he had not taken 'Dane' to the temple.

5

12. Delay in making a complaint may affect the credibility of a witness.

However, if the witness explains the delay to the satisfaction of the court, his

evidence can be relied upon. The explanation has to be plausible. (Perera V.

Attorney General CA 10712011, Sumanasena V. Attorney General [1999) 3

S.L.R. 137,)

13. In the instant case it is evident that the 13-year-old victim's mother and

father were away from home. Victim had been living with his mother and

aunt. It is also evident that the matter was referred to Dayaka Sabhawa.

Even the defence witness Gnanathilake gave evidence to that effect. Dayaka

Sabhawa also may have taken some time to sort the dispute out. The uncle to

whom the victim had told the incident first also had been around 16 years

old at that time. In a village set up it is quite normal for victims' family or

villagers to try to settle this kind of an issue amicably especially when the

priest of the temple is involved.

14. When a child is sexually assaulted by an adult it is also natural for the

Victim's family to think twice before making a complaint to the police.

There can be adverse effects on the child when this kind of offence is

exposed. Victim in this case had given clear evidence as to how this affected

him. Children in school had started teasing and mocking at him referring to

the priest. So much so, he said that he had to leave the school. In such times

mostly the victim would suffer mental trauma due to the social stigma.

15. In cases of sexual offences, Courts have found that victims of sexual

offences can react in different ways. Some may complain immediately.

Others may feel, for example, afraid, shocked, ashamed confused or even

6

guilty and may not speak out until some time has passed. There is no typical

reaction. (Crown Court Compendium Part 1. May 2016)

16. When it comes to a child victim, he or she may even find it difficult to

explain to court the delay in making the complaint. The Trial Judge, before

whom the witnesses testified, is the best person to decide on the credibility

of the victim and the other witnesses as he observed the demeanour and

deportment of the witnesses. In this case the learned trial judge in his

judgment has given careful consideration to the above aspects and also to all

the evidence adduced by the prosecution and defence at the trial.

17. Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that there was no medical evidence

to prove the charge. As I mentioned before in paragraph 08 of this judgment,

the sexual act alleged could be committed without having visible physical

injuries. Medical officer who examined the victim opined that there is a

possibility to commit the alleged sexual act without having visible injuries.

He also said that it is possible to have red patches, and if so, could have

noticed if the victim was examined immediately after the act. Therefore, the

absence of scars of physical injuries visible will not affect the credibility of

the victim. In the circumstances we find that ground of appeal No.2 has no

merit.

18. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence did not reveal that the

alleged offence was committed on the day mentioned in the indictment. We

bear in mind that the victim was 13 years old when the alleged offence was

committed. The evidence was taken in court after about 9 years. Accused is

entitled to know the time of the alleged offence was committed as per the

prosecution, for him to prepare for his defence. Otherwise he would be

deprived of a fair trial.

7

19. According to the victim, the incident occurred on a day he went to offer

'Dane' to the Appellant. It is not in dispute that the 'Dane' was due on the

22nd of every month. Victim, when he was examined by the doctor, had said

that he was abused on 22nd June 2005 morning around 6.30 am when he

went to offer 'Dane'. Victim had also explained the events that took place

thereafter.

20. In cases of sexual offences against children, victims very often find it

difficult to remember the exact date of the offence by the time they testify in

court after a long lapse. However, the Accused should not be deprived of a

fair trial. This aspect was sufficiently discussed in case of R. V. Dossi, 13

Cr.App.R.158.

"In Dossi (supra), it was held that a date specified in an indictment is

not a material matter unless it is an essential part of the alleged

offence; the defendant may be convicted although the jury finds that

the offence was committed on a date other than that specified in the

indictment. Amendment of the indictment is unnecessary, although it

will be good practice to do so (provided that there is no prejudice,

below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the offence was

committed at all it was committed on the day other than that specified.

In case of Wright V. Nicholson 54 Cr.App.R.38, it was held that the

prosecution should not be allowed to depart from an allegation that an

offence was committed on a particular day in reliance on the principle

in Dossi if there is a risk that the defendant has been misled as to the

allegation he has to answer or that he would be prejudiced in having

8

. . f h . I . h f h 'gh t fair trial provIsIon 0 suc partiCU ars m t e context 0 ten t 0

under art.6 of the ECHR." (Archbold Criminal Pleading Evidence and

Practice 20191-225 atpage 83).

This position was accepted and followed In Pandithakora/age V

Selvanayagam 56 N.L.R. 143.

21. It is pertinent to note that the Appellant said in evidence that he kfJew that

this complaint was made to the Temple Development society. He admitted

that he was residing in the temple during that period. While denying the

allegation, he also said that the 'Dane' was due on 22nd of every (J1o!1th from

the house of Simonahamy. While denying talking to the victim he said that

the victim had come to the temple. Appellant had never taken a position that

he was away from the area or from the temple during the period this alleged

offence was committed. It was not a defence of alibi he was taking or

suggesting, but total denial of committing the offence. The leaI11ed Trial

Judge has correctly found that the Appellant committed the offence alleged.

I h b . f h . h h . d' e caused n tea ove premIse we are 0 t e VIew t at t ere was no prejU Ie

to the Appellant in preparing for his defence and therefore he was not

deprived of a fair trial.

For the reasons stated above we find that there is no merit in this appeal and

is dismissed.

22. By the indictment dated 06.06.2010 the Appellant was charged for the

offence that he committed on 22.06 2005. In terms of section 365 b (2) b of

the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 Of 1995, the prescribed

punishment for the offence shall be rigorous imprisonment for a term less

9 --

than 10 years and not exceeding 20 years and with a fine and shall also be

ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by Court to the

person in respect of whom the offence was committed.

By the amendment to the Penal Code by Act No. 16 Of 2006, the mandatory

minimum sentence of imprisonment was amended to 7 years instead of 10

years. Certified date of the Act No. 16 of2006 is 24.04.2006.

23. However, the offence in this case was committed on 22.06 2005, before the

2006 amendment came into operation. Hence the applicable sentence of

imprisonment to this charge is between 10 years and 20 years. Applicable

minimum sentence of imprisonment is 10 years, not 7 years. It is the date of

the offence that applies to the sentence, not the date of the indictment. The

contention of the counsel for the Appellant that the relevant punishment is

decided on the date of indictment and not on the date of offence is untenable.

24. Counsel for the Appellant, in his submission, has invited the court to take the

Circumstances in to consideration and also the principles set out in SC Ref.

No. 03/2008. As stated in Paragraph 22 and 23 of this judgment, Legislature

has clearly prescribed the minimum mandatory imprisonment sentence of 10

years. The Learned High Court Judge in his sentencing order dated

25.06.2015 has not stated any reasons why he should have deviated from the

prescribed sentence, nor we find that the court should have deviated from the

prescribed sentence in the circumstances. It is the bounded duty of the court

to give effect to the intention of the Legislature.

10

25. Therefore, the Learned Trial Judge has erred when he imposed an

imprisonment sentence of 8 years, when in fact the prescribed minimum

mandatory sentence of imprisonment was 10 years. We find that it has also

escaped the mind of the learned State Counsel when she made sentencing

submissions in the High Court. It is also mandatory for the Trial Judge to

order compensation to be paid to the victim which was not done. Hence, as

the punishment imposed is not in conformity with the punishment prescribed

by law, we set aside the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

26. When deciding on the sentence, we are mindful of the sentence prescribed

by law. We take all the mitigatory factors submitted by the counsel for the

Appellant in the High Court. Although the victim impact statement was not

submitted, we take into account the unchallenged evidence adduced by the

victim as to how this affected him in his personal life and education. It is a

clear breach of trust as this offence was committed on the child when he

went to offer 'Dane' to the Appellant who was the priest of the temple, on

his way to school, which is a serious aggravating factor.

27. Taking all these into account we sentence the Appellant as follows;

Rigorous Imprisonment for 12 years.

A fine of Rs. 5,0001-, in default of payment 3 months simple

imprisonment,

Rs. 100,0001- to be paid to the victim as compensation, III

default simple imprisonment for 6 months.

Appeal is dismissed. Sentence varied as above.
