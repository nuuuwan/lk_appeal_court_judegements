ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for

possession of and trafficking in 2.47 grams of heroin on 09.05.2009 at

Badowita. After trial she was convicted by the trial Court on both counts

and was imposed sentences of imprisonment for life.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant

sought intervention of this Court to set them aside. Learned President's

Counsel who appeared for the appellant had relied on the following

grounds of appeal in challenging the validity of the conviction and

sentence;

2

a. the trial Court failed to consider the discrepancies of the

prosecution evidence,

b. the rejection of the evidence adduced by the appellant by the trial

Court is contrary to law.

The prosecution case is that the appellant was arrested with the

alleged quantity of dangerous drugs in her possession at her residence by

officers Dharmasuriya, Rajakanma and WPC 7244 Amaranath of the Police

Narcotic Bureau upon being led to the said compound by an informant of

IP Rangajeewa. The parcel containing heroin was detected concealed

between the brassieres worn by the appellant and her body. The parcel

had a gross weight of 18.9 grams at the time of its detection. The

Government Analyst found the parcel that had been forwarded for its

analysis contained brown powder which weighed 19.23 grams. After

scientific analysis, it was revealed that the brown powder contained 2.47

grams of diacetylmorphine.

In support of the appellant's first ground of appeal, learned

President's Counsel invited attention of Court to the several

inconsistencies that he highlighted between the testimonies of the

prosecution wihlesses. It was his submission that due to these infirmities

which rendered the evidence of prosecution umeliable and the trial Court

had thereby fallen into error acting on such evidence.

Learned President's Counsel, during his submissions referred to an

apparent contradiction on the exact place the appellant was in just before

her arrest. IP Dharmasuriya in his evidence stated when they approached

3

the house of the appellant, she was seated on a plastic chair in the

compound (@~@) surrounded by banana plants. In contrast with this

statement, learned President's Counsel referred to the segment of evidence

where WPC Amaranath, who made the detection, had stated that a woman

was seated at the back of a house facing it, which evidence is in conflict

with the Dharmasuriya's that she was in front of her house.

A closer scrutiny of the evidence does not however reveal an

inconsistency of the place where the appellant was. In fact, witness

Amaranath gave consistent evidence with that of Dharmasuriya as to the

place where the appellant was just prior to her arrest. The segment of her

evidence, that had been highlighted by the appellant referred to what the

informant, who accompanied them up to the point of the appellant's

house, had conveyed to the witness before he parted with them. Her

evidence is clear that after the informant's departure, they have

approached the appellant's house from its front side. The witness had

noted that the appellant, upon seeing their arrival, had made an attempt to

get up excitedly from the chair she was seated on.

It was also highlighted by the appellant that the description of the

approach roadway to the appellant's house differed significantly among

the two witnesses. Witness Dharmasuriya described it as a mere "foot path"

whereas witness Amaranath described it as a roadway in which a three

wheeler could be easily driven on. Subsequently Dharmasuriya offers

further description of the road in his evidence and stated that it is not

made according to a Government plan but merely through usage out of

necessity. He further adds that the said roadway had served three other

4

"

houses, indicating that it is not a mere footpath used sparingly by few

individuals.

Another inconsistency that had been highlighted by the appellant is

that the presence of a polythene parcel marked P5. The appellant's

submission is Dharmasuriya's evidence as to the description of the sealing

indicate that the parcel containing heroin was placed in a transparent

polythene bag and was properly sealed thereafter. The heroin, at the time

of detection, was found inside a pink coloured polythene bag (P4A) and

was thereafter placed in an envelope (P3) at the trial stage. The other clear

polythene bag was marked as P4. Then the prosecution marked yet

another polythene cover containing a brown sticky substance as P5. No

explanation was offered by the prosecution through the expert witness as

to how and when it was introduced. It is this polythene cover the appellant

claims that does not fit into the description given in respect of sealing of

productions.

The Government Analyst, in her evidence described the opening of

the sealed parcel she took charge for analysis. She had opened up a sealed

envelope which contained another sealed polythene bag. Inside that

polythene bag a pink coloured polythene packed containing brown

powder was found. The pink coloured bag was weighed by the analyst in

addition to the powder it contained. This description of the contents

matches with what had been described by the witness Dharmasuriya. There

was no reference to a polythene wrapper/bag, marked as P5 when the

Government Analyst unsealed the parcel in preparation for her analysis.

5

Thus, it is apparent that the trial Court had clear evidence before it

as to what was sealed by the police after the detection and what had been

received and analysed by the Government Analyst in that sealed parcel.

The finding of P5 along with the other polythene bags could not therefore

be considered as a defect in the inward productions chain and therefore is

insufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the parcel sent

for analysis.

Learned President's Counsel made submissions on the apparent

disparity of the gross weight of the parcel that had been allegedly detected

in the possession of the appellant. The parcel had a gross weight of 18.9

grams at the time of its detection as per the evidence of the police

witnesses. When the parcel was weighed at the laboratory of the

Government Analyst Department it was found that the said parcel

weighed 19.23 grams, a higher weight than that was recorded by the

investigators. The proceedings reveal that the expert witness had weighed

the brown powder first and ended up with a weight of 19.23 grams. She

then weighed the pink polythene bag which contained the brown powder

with a weight of 0.687 grams making the total weight of the parcel that had

been detected at 19.917 grams.

The police officers stated In evidence that when the parcel was

weighed at the Police Narcotics Bureau with a reading of 18.9 grams. The

difference between the two readings is a mere 1.017 grams which could

easily be attributable to the inherent limitations in the two weighing scales

used by the witnesses.

6

In support of her second ground of appeal, it was submitted that her

denial was wrongly rejected by the trial Court on the basis that a "large"

quantity of heroin was detected and it was improbable for the PNB officers

to introduce heroin only to the appellant leaving the others who were said

to be there with her at the time of the detection.

The appellant in her rather a short statement from the dock claimed

that she was arrested whilst on road and she had nothing illegal with her

at that time. The trial Court had noted that the disputed fact of the place of

arrest had been put to prosecution witnesses. Those suggestions were

naturally denied by them. In relation the trial Court's reference of a "large"

quantity of prohibited substances is obviously made in reference to the

gross weight and not to the pure quantity of heroin, which was not known

to the officers at the time of detection. Hence, the rejection of the

appellant's denial by the trial Court could not be faulted.

The appellant also relied on the cumulative effect of the several

infirmities she had pointed out before this Court in support of her appeal

to impress upon that she was therefore deprived of a substance of a fair

trial. In this sense this Court is inclined to agree with the submissions of

learned Deputy Solicitor General that the impact of the inconsistencies that

were highlighted before this Court seemed too insignificant to make a dent

in the trial Court's determination to accept the prosecution evidence as

credible, especially when the trial Judge, who delivered the judgment, has

had the distinct advantage of observing the demeanour and deportment of

witnesses who testified before him.

This Court, after a careful consideration of the grounds of appeal of

the appellant, is of the firm view that those grounds are without merit.

The conviction of the appellant on two counts and the sentences

imposed are accordingly affirmed.

Appeal of the appellant stands dismissed.
