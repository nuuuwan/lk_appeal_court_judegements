o I. Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Nuwara-

Eliya on one count of murder punishable under section 296 of the Penal

Code. After trial, the Appellant was found guilty, convicted and was

sentenced to death. Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Appellant

preferred the instant appeal. Grounds of appeal as urged by the counsel for

the Appellant in her written submissions are;

I. PW5 namely Manjula Ruwan Kumara on whose testimony the conviction

revolves is not a credible witness.

2

2. Items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support the

conviction.

3. Learned Trial Judge failed to apply the principles governIl1g the

evaluation of circumstantial evidence cases.

4. Learned Trial Judge had drawn adverse inferences relating to motive

which is not borne out by evidence causing prejudice to the Appellant.

02. I carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, grounds of appeal, written submissions filed and

the oral submissions made by counsel for the Appellant as well as the

Respondent.

Ground of Appeal No.Ol

03. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that PW5 is not a credible witness.

Contention of the counsel is that, PW5 had made the statement to the police

few months late, and also after he was arrested with the Appellant on

SuspIcIOn.

04. The evidence of PW5 was mainly on the confession made to him by the

Appellant. According to PW5, the Appellant is his cousin brother. Appellant

had eloped with the deceased and had come to his house. His parents along

with him had taken the Appellant and the deceased to Pugoda and got them

married. Thereafter, Appellant and deceased had lived in their house for

about 3 months. Appellant had left with the deceased and after sometime,

Appellant had come alone without the deceased and had stayed in PW5's

house until he was arrested. During this period, one-day whilst they were

working in the vegetable plot, PW5 had asked the Appellant as to what

happened to Ganga, the deceased. After making PW5 to promise that he

3

.'.

would not tell anyone, Appellant had confessed to PW5 that he along with 4

others raped, killed and burned the deceased. He had not told anyone about

it as he promised the Appellant who was his cousin, that he would not tell

anyone.

OS. His evidence was that, when both of them were arrested, police had

questioned them separately. When they were being questioned while

keeping them by the side of each other, he had asked the Appellant whether

to tell the police (page 157 of the appeal brief). Then he had narrated to the

police what the Appellant confessed to him.

06. Confession made to another person (not to a person in authority or a police

officer) is admissible if it was made voluntarily, without threat or

inducement, and can be acted upon.

07. V.R. Krishna Ayer J. in case of Nandilli Satpathy V. P.L.Dalli {J978j 2SCC

424 said;

, ... Confession is a potency to make crime conclusive '.

08. The learned Trial Judge in his judgment has carefully analyzed the delay in

coming out with the Appellant's confession to the police by the PW5. At

pages 38 - 42 of his judgment (Pages 388 and 392 of the brief), the learned

Trial Judge has extensively discussed on the voluntariness, admissibility and

the truthfulness of the confession made by the Appellant to the PW5 and has

rightly found that the evidence of PW5 to be credible. Hence, Ground of

appeal No.1 would not succeed.

Grounds of Appeal No.2 and 3.

09. This case is not solely based on circumstantial evidence. Certain other

proved circumstances would strengthen the confession made by the

4

.' \

Appellant to his COUSin PW5. Although the Appellant challenged the

evidence ofPW5 in cross examination, in his statement from the dock he has

not denied or mentioned anything about the evidence of PW5 on the

confession he had made to PW5.

10. After the deceased went missing, the deceased had sent a letter to her twin

sister asking not to look for her. However, the witnesses testified that the

handwriting in that letter was not of the deceased. Upon investigation it was

found that the said handwriting was similar to the handwriting of the

Appellant. Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD) has testified to that

effect. The Appellant in his dock statement had been silent on that letter and

the evidence of the EQD. It is obvious that the Appellant had written that

letter to mislead the family members of the deceased. The learned Trial

Judge has given due consideration to all the circumstances proved and

analyzed the evidence. He has given good and sufficient reasons for

rejecting the dock statement made by the Appellant. As sufficiently reasoned

out by the Trial Judge, in the proved circumstances and the confession made

by the Appellant to PW5, the only inescapable conclusion that the Court can

come to is that the death of the deceased was caused by the Appellant and

not by any other. This court has no reason to interfere with the finding of the

learned Trial Judge that the Accused is guilty as charged, and that the

prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Grounds of

appeal No.2 and 3 has no merit and should necessarily fail.

Ground of Appeal No.4

11. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned Trial Judge has

considered that the Appellant had a motive to commit the offence, when in

fact there was no evidence to that effect.

5

12. PW2 who is the twin sister of the deceased in her evidence said that, the

Appellant and deceased used to quarrel at home. There had been issues

raised by the Appellant on the character of the deceased as well (pages 217

and 218 of the appeal brief). Although the learned Trial judge has taken that

also into consideration, he has said that motive is not an essential element to

prove the charge. As I have elaborated before, there is sufficient evidence to

prove the charge against the Appellant irrespective of the evidence on

motive. Hence, it has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant.

In the above premise, I affirm the judgment of the learned Trial Judge

convicting the Appellant as charged.

Appeal dismissed.
