When this matter was taken up for argument on 6th December 2018, the

.. learned Counsel for the parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment

on the written submissions that would be tendered on behalf of the parties.

The Petitioners state that the 2nd Petitioner is the present owner of a land

known as 'Thattaweli Tharawakany' in extent of approximately 20 acres

situated in Kalpitiya. According to the Petitioners, the 2nd Petitioner purchased

the said land as several lots on a staggered basis and have produced the

relevant deeds pertaining to such purchases, marked 'p14' -'P2S'. The

Petitioners state further that their predecessors in title have owned these

lands for over 72 years and that the said lands are privately owned lands. The

Petitioners have also annexed to the petition marked 'p40' - 'p42', affidavits

2

by persons who claim to have been employed as watchers of the said lands, by

the Petitioners as well as by their predecessors in title.

The Petitioners state that the 1st Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Kalpitiya

had issued the 2nd Petitioner a quit notice dated 23 rd March 2012, annexed to

the petition marked 'P35', issued in terms of Section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, directing the 2nd

Petitioner and all those claiming under the 2nd Petitioner to hand over vacant

possession of Lots A, Band C of Plan No. PU/CD@/2012/026 in extent of 9.052

Hectares, on or before 10th May 2012.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter filed an application for ejectment in the

Magistrate's Court of Puttalam in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act seeking to eject the 2nd Petitioner from the land referred to in

the quit notice 'P35'. The said application for ejectment has been annexed to

the petition, marked 'P45'.

Aggrieved by the said actions of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioners filed this

application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice 'P35';

(b) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st Respondent from taking any

steps under the quit notice 'P35'.

The position of the Petitioners is that the said land is private land and that the

1st Respondent does not have any legal basis to form an opinion that the said

3

lands 'are State land, and therefore the said decision of the 1st Respondent to

issue the quit notice 'P3S' and to institute action under the provisions of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is arbitrary, irrational and illegal.

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was introduced in 1979 to

provide for an expeditious mode of recovery of State land from persons who

were in unauthorised possession or occupation of such ' state lands.l The

purpose of the Act has been discussed in the case of Namunukula Plantations

PLC v. Nimal Punchihewa2, where this Court has held as follows:

"A competent autharity can have recourse to the [State Lands (Recovery of

Possessian)} Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized possession or

occupation of state land including possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land. Any possession or occupation without 'a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law' is unauthorized possession".

Prior to considering the legality of 'P3S', it would be appropriate at this stage

for this Court to lay down the structure of the Act. In terms of Section 3 of the

Act, where the Competent Authority is of the opinion that any land is State

land and that any person is in unauthorised possession or occupation of such

land, he may issue a quit notice to the person in possession of the property

identified in the said notice, requiring such person to vacate the said land with

his dependents, if any, and deliver vacant possession of such land, on a date

not less than thirty days from the date of the issue of the said quit not!ce. In

'Ihalapathirana vs Bulankulame, Director-General U.D.A 11988 (1) Sri LR 416 at 420J - "The clear object of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is to secure posseSSion of such land by an expeditious machinery without recourse to an ordinary civil action".

2 CA (PHC) APN 29/2016; CA Minutes of 9" July 2018.

4

terms of Section 3(lA) of the Act, 'no person shall be entitled to any hearing or

to make any representation in respect oj a notice under subsection (1)'. In the

event the person in possession fails to vacate such land and deliver vacant

possession, the Competent Authority shall be entitled in terms of Section 5 of

the Act to file an application for ejectment in the Magistrate's Court. The

learned Magistrate is thereafter required to issue summons in terms of Section

6 of the Act to the person named in the said application to appear and to show

cause as to why he should not be ejected from the land as prayed for in the

application for ejectment. The scope of the Inquiry that has to be held by the

learned Magistrate and the defenses that could be taken up by a person

against whom an application has been filed for ejectment have been set out in

Section 9 of the Act.

3

It is therefore clear that a very strict regime has been put in place by the

legislature to achieve the object of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, namely to secure possession of such land by an expeditious machinery

without recourse to an ordinary civil action.4

As observed earlier, the primary contention of the Petitioners is that the land

in question is a private land and therefore, the issuance of the quit notice 'P35'

is bad in law. It is the position of the Respondents that the said land is State

land. The Respondents have produced marked 'Rl' Plan No. Pu/tll@/2012/026

3 Section 9 reads as follows:

"(1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under section S except that such person may establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of tbe State granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. (2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for any evidence from the competent authority in support of the application under section S."

prepared by the Surveyor General. The tenement list annexed thereto marked

'RiA' describes the State as being the claimant to the said land and specifies

further that the said land is part of Lots F27 - K27 of Plan No. 165, which has

been produced marked 'R3'. The Respondents have also submitted Preliminary

Plan No. 1381 prepared in 1955 marked 'R2' which describes the lands

referred to in the said plan as being waste land, the State as being the claimant

to the said lands and that the said land is part of Lot Nos. Gi7 - 127 of Plan No.

165.

This Court must observe at this stage that in terms of Section 21 of the Survey

Act No. 17 of 2002, "Any cadastral map, plan, or any other plan or map

prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Act or any written law,

purported to be signed by the Surveyor General or officer acting on his behalf

and offered in evidence in any suit shall be received in evidence, and shall be

taken to be prima facie proof of the facts stated therein."

This Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent had cogent material, in the

form of a Surveyor General's plan that the said land was State land. In these

circumstances, this Court is of the view that the opinion formed by the

Divisional Secretary that the said land is State land is reasonable and is a

decision that a reasonable man would have arrived at, on the strength of the

Surveyor General's plan. Hence, this Court does not see any merit in the

argument of the Petitioners.

This Court is further of the view that the Competent Authority is only required

to form an opinion that the impugned land is State land and that the

possession is unauthorised. The Competent Authority is not required in terms

6

of the Act to carry out an inquiry on the title, as long as he has cogent material

to form an opinion that the land is State land.

This position has been clearly laid down in Farook v. Gunewardena.

Government Agent. Ampara 5 where it was held as follows :

"Where the structure of the entire Act is to preclude' investigations and

inquiries and where it is expressly provided (a) the only defence that can

be put forward at any stage of the proceedings under this Act can be

based only upon a valid permit or written authority of the State and (b)

special provisions have been made for aggrieved parties to obtain relief, I

am of the opinion that the Act expressly precludes the need for an inquiry

by the competent authority before he forms the opinion that any land is

State land."

In any event, the question of title cannot be adjudicated by a Writ Court, as it

involves disputed questions of fact, which could only be resolved by oral ,

testimony of witnesses. The power of this Court to issue Writs when the facts

are in dispute was considered in the case of Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board

and Another.6 In this case, it was held that where the major facts are in

dispute, it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where

parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that

Court would be better able to judge wh ich version is correct, and that a writ

will not issue in such circumstances.

Premasiri and two others [(2009) 2 Sri.L.R. 1071; Rajapaksha Pathiranage Namal Kumara vs Attanayake, Divisional Secretary of Mulatiyana [CA IWrit) Application No. 240/2017; CA Minutes of 4" April 20191; Public Interest Law Foundation vs Central Environmental Authority [(2001) 3 Sri LR 330J.

While following the judgment in Thajudeen's case, this Court, in Office

Equipment Limited vs Urban Development Authorit/ has referred to the

following passage from Regina vs Jenner:8

"the process of judicial review, which rarely allows of the reception of oral

evidence, is not suited to resolving the issues of fact involved in deciding

whether activity said to be prohibited by it is caught by Section 90. These

issues could not possibly be decided upon the contents of affidavits, which

is the form of evidence usually received by the Divisional Court."

This Court is of the view that the question of the 2nd Petitioner's title is a

matter for the Petitioners to establish in a civil court. As submitted by the

learned Senior State Counsel, this position is fortified by Section 12 of the Act,

which provides for title to a land to be vindicated by any person who has been

ejected. In fact, in addition to vindicating title, in terms of Section 13 of the

Act, a person could also obtain compensation for any damages sustained by

being compelled to deliver up possession. The availability of an alternative

remedy will always be a valid consideration when considering an application

for judicial review. It is the view of this Court that as the 2nd Petitioner's claim

is on the basis of several deeds of transfer, the remedy provided in Section 12

will be the most appropriate, suitable and effective remedy for the 2nd

Petitioner.

By the time this application was filed in July 2012, the 1st Respondent had

already instituted proceedings in the Magistrate's Court, Puttalam under the

provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to eject the 2nd

Petitioner from the land referred to in the quit notice. The learned Senior State

Counsel has brought to the attention of this Court that the learned Magistrate

of Puttalam had allowed the said application to eject the 2nd Petitioner by his

Order dated 16th October 2012, and that the revision apptication filed by the

2nd Petitioner in the High Court, Puttalam has also been dismissed.9 In these

circumstances, the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the granting of

the relief prayed for would be futile.

In Ratnasiri vs Ellawala10 what was sought to be quashed was the decision said

to have been made by the Transfer Board, to whom the power of transfer has

been delegated by the Public Service Commission. However, the Public Service

Commission had approved and adopted the decision of the Transfer Board and

no relief has been sought against that decision. Marsoof J PICA (as he then

was) held that it would be futile to grant the reliefs prayed for since it would

still leave intact the decision of the Transfer Board.

The position is no different in this application as Judicial orders have already

been made pursuant to the said quit notice. The Writ of Certiorari being a

discretionary remedy, this Court would not exercise its discretion to quash

'P3S' where it would be futile to do so or where it would be an exercise in vain.

10200412) Sri LR 180 at 208.

In the said circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decision of the 1st

Respondent to issue the quit notice is neither illegal nor irrational and

therefore is of the view t hat the Petitioners are not entitled to a Writ of

Certiorari to quash 'P35', or to the Writ of Prohibition prayed for. This

application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
