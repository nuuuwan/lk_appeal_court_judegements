01. Plaintiff Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted this action in the District Court of

Balapitiya to partition the land called 'Rambodawatte', described in

paragraph 02 of the plaint. The 2nd Defendant Appellant (2nd Defendant) has

intervened and later filed his statement of claim.

02. However, the 2nd Defendant was absent for the trial. On two occasions when

the case was fixed for trial, the 2nd Defendant was absent and tnedical

certificates were filed on behalf of him. Finally, when the case was re fixed

for trial on 16.12.1999, counsel for the 2nd Defendant informed the Court

that he had no instructions from the 2nd Defendant, and the Court proceeded

to trial.

03. The learned District Judge on 25.01.2000 delivered the judgment on the

evidence adduced before him. Being aggrieved by the said judgtnent, the 2nd

Defendant appealed against the same on the following grounds;

1. The said judgment of the learned District Judge is contrary to law.

2

2. The said judgment is against the weight of the evidence led in the

case.

3. The learned District Judge has erred in law by not considering the

interests of the absent parties.

4. The learned District Judge has erred in law by proceeding with the

trial without the disclosed parties are being served with notices, and in

their absence.

04. We carefully considered the plaint, statement of claim filed by the 2nd

Defendant, procedure followed in the District Court, the evidence including

the documents submitted at the trial, written submissions filed by counsel

and the submissions Inade by counsel on behalf of the parties at the

argument of the appeal.

05. Grounds of appeal No. 01 to 04 will be considered together.

Counsel for the Appellant submitted that although nine persons intervened

and claimed before the surveyor, notices were not served on 2nd, 6th and 8th

claimants.

06. First and foremost, it is to be noted that the said claimants on whom the

notices were not served have not made any request to court. It is the 2nd

Defendant/Appellant who is making this submission through his counsel.

Section 48(1) of the Partition Act provides for finality of the interlocutory

and the final decree in a partition action. Section 48(1) clearly provides that

any omission or failure to serve summons on any party, any omission or

defect of any procedure will not affect the finality of the interlocutory and

final decree of a partition action. Intention of the Legislature is very clear

that there should be a finality of an interlocutory or final decree and should

be free from any encumbrances.

3

07. Remedy for a party who has not been served with summons and in

consequence thereof that party is prejudiced by the interlocutory decree, is

provided in section 48(4) a (1) of the Partition Act. Such party can apply for

special leave to establish the right, title or interest of such party,

notwithstanding the interlocutory decree already entered within the

prescribed period. Further, in terms of section 49 of the Act, any person not

being a party to a partition action, whose rights have been extinguished, may

by a separate action recover damages from any party to the action by whose

act or omission such damage may have accrued. Therefore, the so-called

persons whom the Appellant says are interested and not served with

summons are not without a remedy.

08. On perusing the court record of the District Court, it is observed that out of

those persons natned as claimants before the surveyor from the same address

as of the Appellant, 4th, 5th and 9th parties who were served with surrunons

also have not appeared in court. It is also to be noted that once a notice is

sent by registered post it is presumed that it is served. (B. W.Podisingho and

P.A. W.Perera 75 N.L.R. 33).

09. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned District Judge has

failed to consider the deed marked 'P9' from which the Appellant derived

title. As sublnitted by the counsel for the Respondent, the deed No. 2084

marked as 'P9' was attested after the registration of the lispendens in this

case. Therefore, in tenns of section 66 of the Partition Act, the said deed

shall be void. Therefore, learned District Judge was right when he did not

take the deed 'P9' into consideration.

4

10. As submitted by the counsel for the Appellant, and as mentioned in

paragraph 02 of this judglnent, on the 3 rd day that this case was fixed for trial

in the District Court, the Appellant was absent. Counsel had informed court

that he had no instructions, and Court proceeded with the trial. Counsel for

the Appellant contended that when the counsel informed that he had no

instructions, it amounts to non-appearance and that case proceeded exparte.

11. In case of Malwatte V. Gunasekera and Others [1994J 3 Sri L.R. 168, a

similar situation was discussed. In that case, after the Defendant filed his

statelnent of clailn, the Defendant was absent and the counsel moved for a

postponement. Application was refused and Court proceeded to trial. On an

appeal, Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. An application was made in

terms of section 48(4) to vacate the decree and it was refused. Court of

Appeal held, that section 48(4) does not help the Defendant petitioner as he

had sent out his claim through a lawyer. Court of Appeal also held that the

trial had been held not exparte but inter partes. Court of Appeal observed;

"It has been consistently held that if a lawyer appears and applies for

a postponement on behalf of a party the proceedings become inter

partes because there is no such thing as limited appearance. His clear

duty is to continue to appear for his client and to conduct the case

which has been entrusted to him because the consequences to his

client will be far-reaching .... "

Court further observed:

(( ... that if the proctor, does not wish his presence to be construed as

an appearance he must clearly and unambiguously state so. It is not

sufficient to say that he has no instructions. In Mohamed Badurdeen

5

V. Nizan Hadjier, Athukorale J considering these reasons held the

view that the proceedings in a case similar to one under review are

inter partes . ... "

12. The learned Trial Judge has taken all the evidence including the documents

placed before him and decided rightly on the rights of the parties. We find

that all grounds of appeal above are without merit and should necessarily

fail.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
