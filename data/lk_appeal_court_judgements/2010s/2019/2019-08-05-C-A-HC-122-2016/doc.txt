01. This is an appeal against the Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of

Chilaw dated 30.08.2016. The 2nd Accused (Appellant) was indicted with the

1 SI Accused on one count of murder punishable under Section 296 to be read

2

,

with section 32 of the Penal Code. Before the trial commenced, the 1 st

Accused died. The learned High Court Judge, after being satisfied that the

Appellant was absconding, ordered the trial to proceed in the absence of the

Appellant in terms of section 241 Of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

After trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced to

death. Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Appellant preferred the

instant appeal. Grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant as submitted by the

counsel in his submissions are;

1. The learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself by not analyzing

properly the evidence led at the trial and by not giving reasons for his

determinations in his judgment.

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of eye

witnesses is not consistent and cogent to sustain a conviction.

3. The learned Trial Judge has failed to give his attention to the fact that

none of the eye witnesses directly testify that the Accused Appellant

assaulted the deceased.

4. The learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself by accepting the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses despite the existence of

numerous inter-se and per- se contradictions.

5. The learned Trial Judge has erred in law by convicting the Accused

Appellant under common intention in the absence of evidence to

establish common intention.

6. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the medical

evidence does not corroborate the evidence of eye witnesses.

3

,

,

7. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the Prosecution has

failed to establish the causation of death of the deceased beyond

reasonable doubt

8. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the Prosecution

failed to prove the date of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

9. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the Prosecution

failed to consider the events which create reasonable suspicion as to

the guilt of the Accused Appellant.

02. Three eye witnesses testified before the High Court. According to PW 1, he

had gone to the Chinese restaurant owned by the (Kingsly) deceased with

one Nilupan. 1 sl Accused (Lakmal) and the Appellant (Suduwa) had come.

1st Accused had been carrying a manna knife and Appellant had been

carrying a sword. Lakmal had cut the deceased. Appellant had tried to cut

the deceased with the sword but, the deceased had held the chair to prevent.

Then the deceased had run out of the restaurant. Lakmal had chased behind

the deceased and Appellant also had run behind. When the witness went to

see, the deceased had been fallen face down near the Fish plank (malulaalla).

When the witness tried to get close, both Appellant and Lakmal had

prevented him saying that he also would be cut. Then he had run away.

03. According to the evidence ofPW2, for the living, he had been selling fish at

the super market which is near the restaurant owned by the deceased. When

he was asleep, he was woken up by a noise. He had heard the Appellant

yelling at the deceased asking the deceased to come out and that he would

come back in half an hour. At about 3.30, the 1 sl Accused and Appellant had

come armed with a knife and a sword respectively. He had seen the incident

clearly. 1

51 Accused had chased after deceased and the Appellant had been

4

near the gate keeping the sword. 1 st Accused had cut the deceased twice

with the knife and the Appellant had been waiting with the sword to prevent

others coming. Appellant had prevented the witness going near the deceased

to prevent the fight. Appellant had tried to assault him and he had run to

escape.

04. PW3 when giving evidence had tried to avoid testifying. He even had denied

making a statement to the police. Finally, upon admitting giving a statement

about 06 months after the incident, he said that 1 sl Accused and the

Appellant came in his three-wheeler to the restaurant. He initially said that

the 1 sl Accused and the Appellant did not possess weapons. At this point in

time the State Counsel had moved for an adjournment to lead further

evidence as the original information book was not available. The learned

Trial Judge making his observations that there is a possibility that the

witness would give false evidence had remanded PW3 until the next date.

On the next date, the witness gave incriminating evidence against both 1 Sl

Accused and the Appellant.

05. It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellant, that remanding of PW3 for

3 months has caused prejudice to the Appellant and has caused a miscarriage

of justice. On 26.03.2015 the learned High Court Judge remanded PW3 until

the next trial date. The reason given by the learned High Court Judge was

that on observing his demeanour, that he would give false evidence and it

was doubtful that he would appear in Court to give evidence. Although PW3

initially tried to exonerate the Appellant and the 1 sl Accused, after coming

from remand he testified incriminating the Appellant and the 1 sl Accused.

The effect of remanding a witness who fails to give evidence in line with his

statement given to the police was discussed in case of Priyantha Ratnayake

V. The Hon. Attorney General CA 4112012 [30.05.2014J. His Lordship

Justice Anil Goonaratne said;

"It is the view 0/ this Court that it is irregular and it amounts to

a miscarriage o/justice/or the witness to be remanded/or the reasons

adduced by the Trial Judge. This act 0/ remanding would have a

serious impact not only on witness No.6 but on all other prosecution

witnesses who gave evidence subsequently at the trial. On this aspect

the trial Judge at pg. 190 also observes that witness Nos. 5 & 7

appears to be giving evidence not according to their free will and they

appear to be scared. This is more than sufficient material enable me

to address my mind that a/air trial had not been conducted and that it

amounts to a miscarriage o/justice. The evidence led and admitted in

the trial Court would on one hand caused prejudice to the Accused-

Appellant and on the other hand whatever the evidence transpired

subsequent to witness No.6 being remanded would be tainted with

bias and questionable position 0/ each party be/ore Court. Merely

because the Trial Judge rejected the version 0/ witness No.6 by his

judgment would not suffice since by that point 0/ time the damage had

occurred, and left room, for a witness to tell the truth or untruth under

oath due to the earlier act 0/ Court in remanding a witness, and such

a signal to the witness to give evidence according to the police

statement, through/ear o/being remanded (like witness No.6). "

06. It is clear that in this case witness PW3 in his evidence, whether he told the

truth or the untruth, was compelled to give evidence in line with his

statement to the police, due to the fear of being further remanded. Therefore,

it would cause a grave miscarriage of justice if the Court acts upon his

6

evidence. Hence, his evidence has to be disregarded. However, unlike in the

case of Ratnayake V. AG (supra), in the instant case, the evidence of PWI

and PW2 was recorded before recording of the evidence of PW3. Therefore,

remanding PW3 would not have had any effect on the evidence ofPWI and

PW2. Hence, taking the evidence ofPWI and PW2 into consideration would

not cause any prejudice to the Appellant, nor that would cause any

miscarriage of justice.

07. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Trial Judge has

accepted the evidence for the prosecution, despite the fact that there were

numerous inter-se and per-se contradictions. It is the contention of the

counsel that witnesses have given different stories contradicting themselves.

It is apparent that the eye witnesses for the prosecution PWI and PW2 were

not together at the time of the incident. According to PWI, he had been

consuming alcohol with the deceased at the restaurant when the Appellant

and the 1 sl Accused came. Therefore, he witnessed the incident from the

beginning. However, PW2 was not inside the restaurant. He had been

sleeping on the fish plank. Only after he heard the noise, he had woken up.

By the time he saw the incident, the deceased and the accused persons had

been outside of the restaurant. Therefore, it is obvious that the two

witnesses, PWI and PW2 had seen the incident in two different stages from

two different places. PW2 had not seen what happened inside the restaurant

initially. Hence, each witness gives evidence on account of when they saw.

Therefore, if their evidence is believed to be true, one cannot say that they

contradict each other for giving evidence on what each of them saw

separately.

08. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Trial Judge has failed

to give attention to the fact that none of the eye witnesses directly testifies

that the Appellant assaulted the deceased. It is further submitted that the

learned Trial Judge erred in convicting the Appellant in the absence of

evidence to establish common intention.

09. In case of Sarath Kumara V. Attorney General CA 20512008 [04.04.2014]

Court of Appeal held;

" Once a participatory presence is furtherance of a common

intention is established at the commencement of the incident, there is

no requirement that both perpetrators should be physically present at

the culmination of the event unless it could be shown by some overt

act that one perpetrator deliberately withdrew from the situation to

disengage and detach himself from vicarious liability . ... "

10. It is evident that both 1

51 Accused and the Appellant came to the scene

together at the same time. PW 1 in his evidence said that the Appellant struck

the sword thrice on the deceased, but the deceased held the chair. PWI

further said that when the Appellant struck the sword, he went in between

and it did not strike anyone.

11. PW2 also testified as to what the Appellant did when he saw him.

12. I bear in mind that mere presence of an accused at the scene of crime will

not establish the common intention. However, the above evidence clearly

shows that it was not mere presence, but the Appellant actively participated

in assaulting the deceased and that it was in furtherance of the common

intention he shared with the 1 51 Accused to kill the deceased. The weapons

used and the injuries caused to the deceased clearly demonstrate the

intention of the 1 51 Accused and the Appellant.

9

13. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Prosecution has failed to

establish the causation of death of the deceased beyond reasonable doubt. It

is further argued that the medical evidence does not corroborate the evidence

of eye witnesses.

14. PW14 Dr. Kumudu Kumari Jusar has testified on the injuries observed on

the deceased by Dr.Athukorala when the deceased was initially hospitalized.

Upon death of the deceased, the autopsy was conducted by Dr. Indra Lalani

Ratnayake. According to her evidence, the deceased had been admitted to

National Hospital initially on 20.10.2010. After 03 weeks he had been

transferred to Negombo hospital and then again was admitted to National

hospital on 11.06.2011. Patient had died on 08.08.2011. She gave clear

evidence that the cause of death of the deceased was 'hydrocephalus', which

is collection of fluid in the brain. She had said that it was due to the injuries

caused to the head. Further she had said that the brain particles were dead

due to the assault on the head. She further said that the deceased had been

continuously unconscious from the 20.10.2010 till he died. Therefore, it is

clear that the deceased died due to the injuries caused by the 1st Accused

with the shared common intention with the Appellant.

15. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 214 of the brief has

given good and sufficient reasons as to how the Appellant shared the

common intention with the 151 Accused in committing the offence.

10

16. In the above premise I find that the grounds of appeal urged by the

Appellant are without merit and that there is no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Therefore, the conviction and the

sentence on the Appellant afftrmed.

Appeal dismissed.
