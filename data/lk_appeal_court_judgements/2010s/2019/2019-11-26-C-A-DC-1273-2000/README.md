Janak De Silva J.

These are three appeals against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Gampaha dated

14.11.2000.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted the above styled action in the District Court of

Gampaha seeking inter alia to partition the land called Bulugahawatta containing in extent A.2-

R.2-P.0 morefully described in the schedule to the plaint dated 23.03.1990. The said land is also

depicted in preliminary plan No. 524 dated 01.12.1990 made by T. A. D. A. Senanayake, Licensed

Surveyor as Lots A - C and contains in extent A.2-R.0-P.35.9. The Licensed Surveyor, in the

Surveyor's Report dated 05.12.1990 [Page 258 ofthe Appeal Brief), has identified the said Lots A

- C ofthe said preliminary plan No. 524 as the land to be partitioned.

The Plaintiff averred in her plaint that-

1. The original owner of the said land was Juwanis Wedarala;

2. By Deed No. 2613 dated 11.03.1905, he conveyed an undivided 1/2 share of his

entitlement to Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho, Punchi Appu and Elisahamy;

Page 5 of 11

3. The said Juwanis Wedarala died intestate and the remainder of his entitlement to the land

called Bulugahawatta was devolved among his children namely Saradiel Appu, Appu

Singho, Punchi Appu, Elisahamy and Rapiel;

4. Thereafter, Rapiel transferred an undivided 1/8 share to Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho and

Punchi Appu by Deed No. 21194 dated 23.02.1925 ("1.2);

5. The said Punchi Appu died intestate and issueless hence his entitlement to the said land

devolved among his siblings namely Appu Singho, Saradiel Appu, Rapiel and Elisahamy;

6. Rapiel transferred his entitlement to Appu Singho by Deed No. 11675 dated 24.10.1964

(7133);

7. Saradiel Appu died intestate and his entitlement to the said land devolved among his

children namely Podihamy, Punchi Nona, Thimanis (i.e. the 10th Defendant) and Hami

Nona;

8. The said Podihamy together with her husband, Jakolis, transferred her undivided share to

the said land to Rapiel by Deed No. 3571 dated 01.05.1944;

9. The said Punchi Nona transferred her entitlement to the said land to Rapiel by Deed No.

858 dated 23.09.1948 ("I.3);

10. Rapiel transferred the entitlement he got by the said Deeds No. 3571 and No. 858 to Appu

Singho by Deed No. 1184 dated 02.04.1949 ("I.4);

11. Appu Singho transferred an undivided 5/6 share of 1/2 an acre to Balasuriya Lekamlage

Gabosingho by Deed No. 8554 dated 12.11.1960 ("1.5) and he conveyed it to Hapuwalana

Arachchige Karlinahamy by Deed No. 11684 dated 26.10.1964 ("1.6);

12. By Deed No. 2195 dated 28.04.1985 ("I.7), Karlinahamy transferred her entitlement to

the said land to Balasuriya Lekamlage Milinona (i.e. the Plaintiff);

13. Aforementioned Hami Nona died intestate and her entitled devolved to her husband (i.e.

the 2nd Defendant) and her children (i.e. the 1st and 3 ,d -7th Defendants);

14. Appu Singho died intestate and his entitlement devolved to his wife (i.e. Hapuwalana

Arachchige Karlinahamy) and his children (i.e. the 8th and 9th Defendants, the Plaintiff and

Balasuriya Lekamlage Martin);

15. The said Martin, by Deed No. 20 dated 21.05.1975, transferred an undivided 1/2 share of

his entitlement to Balasuriya Lekamlage Irangani Chandra Balasuriya and Wimaladasa

subject to his life interest;

16. Thereafter, Irangani Chandra Balasuriy, Wimaladasa and Martin transferred their

entitlement to the 1't Defendant by Deed No. 1603 dated 09.12.1987 (1134);

Page 6 of 11

17. The said Martin transferred the remainder of his entitlement to Seelin Nona by Deed No.

2333 dated 24.02.1986 (151) and she conveyed it to the 1st Defendant by Deed No. 1622

dated 12.01.1988 (152).

Accordingly, the Plaintiff prayed that the said land to be partitioned among the parties to the

action in the following manner-

Plaintiff

1st Defendant

2nd Defendant

3rd - 7th Defendants

8th Defendant

9th Defendant

10th Defendant

Unallotted Shares

Undivided 6790/15360

Undivided 2895/15360

Undivided 556/15360

Undivided 464/15360

Undivided 488/15360

Undivided 488/15360

Undivided 1112/15360

Undivided 2567/15360

The 1st - 5th and 7th Defendants-Appellants (Appellants), by their Statement of Claim dated

09.06.1993, disputed the pedigree produced by the Plaintiff and submitted an alternative

devolution.

The 11th -14th Defendants-Appellants (Appellants) intervened and filed Statements of Claim. The

11th Appellant, by her Statement of Claim dated 28.09.1992, disputed the corpus to be

partitioned and produced an alternative devolution. She further claimed absolute ownership to

the allotment of land marked Lot B in the aforementioned preliminary plan No. 524. The 12th and

13th Appellants, by their Statement of Claim dated 31.08.1992, partially accepted the pedigree of

the Plaintiff but claimed an undivided 1/8 share ofthe land to be partitioned as heirs of Elisahamy.

The 14th Appellant, by her Statement of Claim dated 02.04.1996, disputed the corpus to be

partitioned and claimed absolute ownership to the allotment of land marked Lot C in the said

preliminary plan No. 524.

After a lengthy trial, the learned District Judge entered a judgment in favour of the Plaintiff and

decided that the said land should be partitioned in the manner laid down in the plaint. An

undivided 2567/15360 share of the land to be partitioned was given to the 12th and 13th

Appellants. Aggrieved by the said judgment the 1st - 7th, 11th and 14th Appellants appealed.

In a partition case, it is incumbent on the Judge to investigate into title of each party before he

arrives at a determination [Chandrasena v. Piyasena and Others (1999) 3 Sri.L.R. 201) and it is the

prime duty of the trial judge to carefully examine and investigate the actual rights and titles to

the land sought to be partitioned [Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi and Two Others (2010) 1 Sri.L.R.

Page 7 of 11

87). Although there is a duty cast on the Court to investigate title in a partition action, the Court

can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both

documentary and oral. The Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding

the shares in the corpus for them [Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan and Others (1996) 2 Sri.loR. 66).

According to the plaint, the original owner of the land to be partitioned was Juwanis Wedarala.

It is claimed that, by Deed No. 2613 dated 11.03.1905, he conveyed an undivided 1/2 share of his

entitlement to Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho, Punchi Appu and Elisahamy. The said Deed No. 2613

was not marked in evidence. A document issued by the Registrar of Gampaha Land Registry

marked as '~1.1' shows that the duplicate kept at the Gampaha Land Registry is decayed making

it impossible to produce a certified copy of the said Deed No. 2613.

However, if Juwanis Wedarala conveyed an undivided 1/2 share of Bulugahawatta by the said

Deed No. 2613, then Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho, Punchi Appu and Elisahamy got an undivided

1/8 share each.

It is further stated in the plaint that after the demise of Juwanis Wedarala, the remainder of his

entitlement (the remaining undivided 1/2 share) to the land to be partitioned devolved among

his children namely Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho, Punchi Appu, Elisahamy and Rapiel (i.e. an

undivided 1/10 share each).

Accordingly, the entitlement of the children of Juwanis Wedarala to the land to be partitioned

should be as follows-

Saradiel Appu

Appu Singho

Punchi Appu

Elisahamy

Rapiel

Undivided 9/40

Undivided 9/40

Undivided 9/40

Undivided 9/40

Undivided 1/10

However, according to '~1. 2', Rapiel has transferred an undivided 1/8 share of Bulugahawatta to

Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho and Punchi Appu. As I observed earlier, Rapiel only became entitled

to an undivided 1/10 share of Bulugahawatta as paternal inheritance. Therefore, it is possible

that he either purchased an undivided 1/40 share from one of the siblings (which would make

him entitled to an undivided 1/8 share of Bulugahawatta) or a sibling who got entitled to an

undivided 1/8 by virtue of Deed No. 2613 dated 11.03.1905 transferred that entitlement to Rapiel

(which would make him entitled to an undivided 9/40 share of Bulugahawatta).

It is clear, by the recital of '0,.2', that what Rapiel transferred to 5aradiel Appu, Appu 5ingho and

Punchi Appu is not what he got as paternal inheritance but what he became entitled to by virtue

of Deed No. 12531 dated 07.03.1912. The said Deed No. 12531 was not marked in evidence nor

was an explanation given to justify such failure. It is possible that "someone" transferred an

undivided 1/8 of Bulugahawatta to Rapiel. It could be anyone of four siblings of Rapiel (Le.

5aradiel Appu, Appu 5ingho, Punchi Appu and Elisahamy), if it is assumed that the pedigree laid

down in the Plaint is correct.

It was held in the case of Mohomedoly Adomjee ond Others v. Hadad Sadeen and Others (58

N.L.R. 217 at 225) as follows-

"The Trial Judge should insist upon the production of the relevant extracts from the

registers kept under the Land Registration Ordinance. They may reveal registered

instruments suggesting the possible existence of title in persons other than the parties

before the Court. The names of 011 such persons should be ascertained by due investigation

and they should be given notice of the proceedings. Whether they appear in the Court or

not, the effect of such instruments upon the title set up by the parties before the Court

should be exomined."

On the face of '0,.2', it is stated that the same is registered in folio C 143/88 and 89 at Negombo

Land Registry. If the said folio was produced before the learned District Judge, it would have been

easy to discover the identity of the grantor of the said Deed No. 12531. Not only was the said

folio was not produced before the Court but also the Plaintiff has failed to lead any evidence

regarding the said Deed No. 12531 during the trial. Thus, the identity of the grantor of the said

Deed No. 12531 remains unknown.

By virtue of '",.2', 5aradiel Appu, Appu 5ingho and Punchi Appu became entitled to an undivided

1/24 share of Bulugahawatta each. However, the uncertainty of the identity of the grantor of the

said Deed No. 12531 renders it impossible to calculate the total shares owned by each of the five

siblings subsequent to the execution of '0,.2'.

Page 9 of 11

In the case of Maddumaralalage Dana Mary Nona v. Maddumoralalage Don Justin and Others

(2016 B.loR. 130) Eva Wanasundera, P. c., J. held as follows-

"In 0 partition action, the Judge has to decide what share of the land should be allotted to

which party. It is different from answering issues in a money recovery case, a divorce case, a

rent and ejectment case, a land dispute case, a debt recovery case, a case based on contract

or a case based on delict etc. In those cases, the answers could be in the affirmative or in the

negative, may be with some comment or a remark which would show the inclination to the

final decision. But in a partition action, each party claims different portions of one big land

and the Judge is expected to sort out what share of the land should be granted to which

plaintiff and/or defendant. For this reason, I find that the onus of the Judge in a partition case

is somewhat more difficult than in any other kind of case, since the Judge has to specifically

calculate the share of entitlement," [emphasis added].

Even though the identity of the grantor of the said Deed No. 12531 remains unknown, if an

inference can be gathered as to the proper entitlement ofthe parties to the land to be partitioned

by the other deeds/documents marked by them, I am of the opinion that the partitioning of the

land can proceed.

To establish her title to the land to be partitioned, the Plaintiff has marked the Deed No. 858

dated 23.09.1948 as 'ol.3'. The recital of 'ol.3' states as follows-

", .. 'j)tf)!5) Z tJz:g~@ZSJ30 @() (1) ~3~rg8", @~ZSJ@~3@a:! c"o?@"'~ tfd8tf)3@@(J)251' 8", edt@ [)

tJt;@(J)25) ( 25) @@rfj atf)!5) ea@~~25)@d tJc!!5)O ZSJ(25) @<fas ... "

The Schedule of 'ol.3' describes two defined portions of Bulugahawatta with certain boundaries.

The only inference that can be gathered by the contents of 'ol.3' is that the five siblings (i.e,

Saradiel Appu, Appu Singho, Punchi Appu, Elisahamy and Rapiel), at some point subsequent to

the execution of 'ol.2', have come to an amicable settlement to possess defined portions of the

land to be partitioned. However, there is neither documentary nor oral evidence to substantiate

the said premise.

Deeds marked 'ol.4', 'ol.5', 'ol.6' and 'ol.7' by the Plaintiff and the Deeds marked '154' and 7 51'

by the Defendants refer to the said defined portions of Bulugahawatta. Even though the Deeds

marked '151', '15 2', 7 52' and 7 53' refer to the land to be partitioned what is conveyed by the

said Deeds are the undivided entitlements (B~~ @) e 25'lJe@~ q13rilElJBl:il) of the grantors of the

said Deeds and not their specific entitlements. It must also be noted that the deeds marked during

the trial refer to several other deeds that were not produced before the Court.

Page 10 of 11

In view of the above, I hold that the Plaintiff has failed to properly establish her entitlement to

the land to be partitioned and that the chain of title laid down in the plaint of the Plaintiff is

broken. Thus, I hold that the learned District Judge has erred in entering a judgment in favour of

the Plaintiff without calculating the correct share of entitlement of each party.

On an appeal in a partition action, if it appears to the Court of Appeal that the investigation of

title has been defective, it should set aside the decree and make an order for proper investigation

[Mahamedaly Adamjee and Others v. Hadad Sadeen and Others (supra)].

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of learned District Judge of Gampaha dated

14.11.2000. I make further order that trial de novo to be held before the District Court

expeditiously and the learned District Judge to take every reasonable step to conclude the trial

early.

Appeals are allowed to the extent set out above. The Appellants will be entitled to the costs of

this appeal.
