DEFENDANT-RESPONDENTS

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

Prof W.M.Karunadasa for the Plaintiff-Appellant

Upul Kumaraperuma for the 11'h Defendant-Respondent

Dr.Sunil Coorey for the 12th Defendant-Respondent

26.07.2019

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted this action

against the Defendants seeking to partition a land called "Paraveni Devel Addarawatta"

described in the 2nd paragraph of the plaint. The preliminary survey was effected by

Licensed Surveyor Withanachchi and the plan bearing No 725 and the accompanying

report were returned to Court.

In order to identify the lot that had been incorporated into the subject-matter, the n th

Defendant moved for a commission and licensed surveyor Ranjan Weerasuriya was issued

with a commission to execute this task and he returned plans bearing No.966 and 966A

along with one report for both plans. The two plans were marked as 'Z' and 'Y'

respectively. The preliminary plan marked 'x' depicted the land to be partitioned as

"Paravel1idive/a Addarawatte" and indicated in the plan as 'tf. But the nth Defendant

contended that the northern portion of the land depicted as 'er' belongs to him and this

northern portion was depicted as A2 in the 2nd Plan bearing No.966. A2 was depicted as

'er2' in the other plan (966A) drawn up by Ranjan Weerasuriya marked as Y.

3

The question before Court was whether A2 in 966(2) or q2 in 966A (Y) must be excluded

from the subject-matter of the partition suit brought by the Plaintiff. In order to secure the

exclusion, the 11th Defendant as well as the licensed surveyor Weerasuriya gave evidence.

The 11th Defendant attested to the fact that A2 in 966(Z) or q2 in 966A (Y) is her land and

that there were a multitude of rubber trees in this lot. This assertion of the 11th Defendant

is corroborated by the report of Weerasuriya (Y) in which the Surveyor refers to a

proliferation of rubber trees on A2. Even in Al which is depicted as part of the 11th

Defendant's land, the surveyor indicated the presence of about 100 trees on that lot.

In comparison no such cultivation of rubber is found to be in the Plaintiff's land and this

comparison gives credence to the story that there was a difference between what the 11th

Defendant claims to be his land and the land that the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle found to be Plaintiff's co-owned land. In addition the llth Defendant gave clear

evidence that she enjoyed the fruits of the cultivation in her land. No such evidence comes

out quite convincingly from the evidence of the Plaintiff. Moreover, there is the

unchallenged evidence of the 11th Defendant that when she was in the habit of selling the

fruits of the cultivation on Ai in 966 or q2 in 966A, there was no impediment or

obstruction that she encountered from the Plaintiff or anyone else. This evidence clearly

shows that the llth Defendant had uninterrupted and undisturbed possession of her A lots

on 966 or q2 or qi in 966A. So the 11th Defendant made out a strong case for exclusion of

these lots which he alleged consistently that the Plaintiff had brought into the case as part

of the corpus to be partitioned. The question before this Court is whether the 11th

Defendant has established that the land depicted as Lot A2 in Plan No.966 is a portion of

a separate contiguous land called "Galagahawawatta, Hecnkiriya, Heenkiriya Kumbura,

Addarabedda alias Gagululcnwaua alias Gaguiella". It has to be kept in mind that the

preliminary plan X depicted a different land known as "Paravcnidivela Addarawatta". It was

into this "Paravenidivela Addarawal ta" that the Plaintiff had brought in "Galahcnegoda" the

contiguous land so asserted by the 11th Defendant.

4

Mr. Upul Kumaraperuma, the learned Counsel for the 11th Defendant-Respondent took

this Court through several items of evidence in the cross-examination of the Plaintiff that

pOinted to the fact that the Plaintiff had brought into the subject-matter the land of the

11th Defendant.

For instance at one stage the Plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that the boundaries

in the preliminary plan had been erroneously shown to the Surveyor-Withanachchi who

effected the preliminary survey.

The Plaintiff also admitted that the surveyor did the preliminary survey in the way she

pOinted out the boundaries. This admission estops the Plaintiff from asserting that the

preliminary survey was accurately done. Withanachchi-the preliminary surveyor was not

summoned by the Plaintiff and there is no other older plan that was produced to the

preliminary surveyor to establish that it is the corpus depicted in X that was the correct

corpus for partition.

Thus the assertion of the 11th Defendant that the Plaintiff had brought in A2, -a Lot which

belongs to the 11th Defendant, into the partition action is amply corroborated by the

admission of the Plaintiff-Appellant.

In order to establish that A2 in Plan No.966 whose exclusion that the 11th Defendant

claimed, the 11th Defendant produced the Deed of Transfer bearing No.3406 dated

11.09.1946 (lV2) and the Deed of Transfer bearing No.13556 dated 09.02.1972 (llV3).

In her testimony Saraswathy Dias Wijegunasinghe (11th Defendant) quite clearly testified

as to how the land devolved on her from her husband J othipala Sirisena. She also said that

Ajith Ranjan Weerasuriya (the surveyor who prepared the subsequent plans 966 and 966A

has shown in these plans that A2 in Plan No.966 (Z ) belongs to her.

I must further comment that fresh evidence that was brought into this case by way of

documents is not relevant to this case at all and upon a perusal of the documents it is clear

that the schedules of those documents refer to a totally different land. Since it has been

established that A2 is a land that has been brought into the corpus put up for partition, it

is justifiable that the land A2 has to be excluded and the 11th Defendant-Respondent has

5

conclusively established this fact. The learned Additional District Judge of Galle in his

judgement dated 26th July 2000 is quite correct in holding that Lot A2 in Plan bearing no

966A must be excluded and restricting the corpus only to Lot A3 in Plan bearing No 966A.

In the circumstances I see no merit in the appeal and I proceed to affirm the judgement of

the learned Additional District Judge of Galle and dismiss the appeal.
