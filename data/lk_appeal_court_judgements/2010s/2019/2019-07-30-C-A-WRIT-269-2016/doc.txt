Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Kanishka De Silva Balapatabendi, S.S.C., for

the Respondents.

Decided on: 29.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners who are graduates residing in the Southern

Province filed this application against the respondents seeking to

quash by way of writ of certiorari the decision of the 1st-11th

respondents to make appointments of graduates to the Teachers

Service in the Southern Province based on Divisional Secretariat

basis; and to compel them by way of writ of mandamus to follow

the recruitment procedure laid down in the Sri Lanka Teachers

Service Minute; and to prohibit them by way of writ of

prohibition from adopting the Divisional Secretariat basis in

recruiting graduate teachers to the Southern Province. Further,

they seek to compel the said respondents by way of writ of

mandamus to consider the petitioners for filling the remaining

vacancies of the Teachers Service in the Southern Province prior

to making appointments based on the subsequent newspaper

advertisement marked P17 and the results of the competitive

examination held on 30.07.2016.

Although there were 59 petitioners initially, learned counsel for

the petitioners in the written submission has stated that only 40

3

petitioners presently remain unemployed. They are the 1st, 3rd-

5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th-28th, 30th, 33rd-37th, 40th, 42nd, 43rd-

46th, 48th, 49th, 51st-59th petitioners.

The 1st respondent-Secretary to the Ministry of Education of the

Southern Province by advertisement marked P2 called for

applications to recruit graduates for Class 3 Grade I of the Sri

Lanka Teachers Service stating that recruitments would be done

on Divisional Secretariat basis in terms of Sri Lanka Teachers

Service Minute.

In P2 the Divisional Secretariat Divisions in which vacancies

exist and the subjects have been stated. In terms of this

recruitment procedure the priority is given to the applicants who

reside in the Divisional Secretariat Divisions where vacancies

exist.

According to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service Minute published

in the Gazette marked P3, which was operative when

applications were called by P2, recruitments to Class 3 Grade I

of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service shall be on Merit basis by way

of a competitive examination.

The petitioners have tendered the advertisements published by

some the other Provinces marked P5-P10 to say that in those

Provinces, recruitments of graduates to Class 3 Grade I of the

Sri Lanka Teachers Service are done in terms of the procedure

laid down in the Sri Lanka Teachers Service Minute.

Irrespective of Divisional Secretariat basis of recruitment, the

petitioners have applied for the said vacancies.

4

Then by P13 the 1st respondent has inter alia informed the

petitioners that direct recruitment would be made if the

applicants are less than the vacancies in a particular Divisional

Secretariat Division, and otherwise, there would be a competitive

examination as stated in the P2 advertisement. It has further

been stated that the number of vacancies stated in the annexure

to P13 have increased due to subsequent retirement of teachers

and steps would be taken to fill those vacancies also without

delay.

The examination has been held on 14.11.2015 and the results

have been released on 01.01.2016 and interviews have been

held from January 2016 to February 2016. Selections have

been made but the petitioners were not among them.

Thereafter the 1st respondent has published a new

advertisement marked P17 dated 30.04.2016 calling for

applications for recruitment of graduates to Class 3 Grade I of

the Sri Lanka Teachers Service stating that recruitments would

be done on Divisional Secretariat basis in terms of Sri Lanka

Teachers Service Minute.

In P17 the relevant Divisional Secretariat Divisions in which

vacancies exist, the schools, the subjects and the number of

vacancies etc. have been stated. The petitioners have submitted

applications in response to this advertisement as well and

examination had been conducted and interviews held but the

petitioners have not been selected.

According to the Sri Lanka Teachers Service Minute published

in the Gazette marked P4, which was operative when

5

applications were called by P17, recruitments to Class 3 Grade I

of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service shall be on School basis.

The petitioners have shown irregularities in the appointment

process in the counter affidavits. However the said appointees

are not parties to the case and therefore without affording them

an opportunity to unfold their side of the story no finding can be

made against them.

The pivotal argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is

that the decision of the respondents to recruit graduates in the

Southern Province for the vacancies in the Sri Lanka Teachers

Service on Divisional Secretariat basis is against the national

policy of the Central Government as reflected in the Service

Minutes marked P2 and P3 where the former states that

recruitments shall be on Merit basis and the latter states that it

shall be on School basis. The learned counsel emphasizes that

neither P2 nor P3 allows recruitments to be made on Divisional

Secretariat basis. The learned counsel strenuously argues that

a Provincial Council cannot deviate from the National Policy of

the Central Government on any subject or area including

scheme of recruitment. The counsel refers to Article 55 of the

Constitution to say that it is the Cabinet of Ministers who is

vested with the power to determine the policy decisions on all

matters relating to public officers including appointments. To

buttress that argument, the counsel also refers to the Reserved

List in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which

states that National Policy on all Subjects and Functions rests

with the Central Government.

6

Assuming P2 and P3 Service Minutes reflect the National Policy

on recruitment to Sri Lanka Teachers Service, the question is

whether the Southern Provincial Council could have formulated

their own scheme of recruitment. This appears to be permitted

subject to limitations. This can be explained in reference to the

Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987.

Item 4 of Appendix III of the Provincial Council List in the

Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which deals with

Education, reads as follows:

Recruitment into the Teaching Service of those with

diplomas and degrees, from Colleges of Education and

Universities, recognised as teaching qualifications.

Section 32 of the Provincial Councils Act reads as follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of any other law the

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of

officers of the provincial public service of such Province is

hereby vested in the Governor of that Province.

(2) The Governor of a Province may, from time to time,

delegate his powers of appointment, transfer, dismissal

and disciplinary control of officers of the provincial public

service to the Provincial Public Service Commission of that

Province.

(2A) The Provincial Public Service Commission of a province

may, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by

the Governor of that Province, delegate to the Chief

Secretary or any officer of the provincial public service of

7

that Province, its powers of appointment, transfer,

dismissal, and disciplinary control of officers of the

provincial public service.

(2B) Any officer of the provincial public service of a Province

aggrieved by any order made by the Chief secretary or any

officer of the provincial public service of that Province, to

whom the Provincial Public Service Commission of that

Province has delegated its powers under the preceding

subsection, shall have a right of appeal to such Provincial

Public Service Commission.

(3) The Governor shall provide for and determine all

matters relating to officers of the provincial public service,

including the formulation of schemes of recruitment and

codes of conduct for such officers, the principle to be

followed in, making promotions and transfers, and the

procedure for the exercise and the delegation of the powers

of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control

of such officers. In formulating such schemes of recruitment

and codes of conduct the Governor, shall, as far as

practicable, follow the schemes of recruitment prescribed for

corresponding offices in the public service and the codes of

conduct prescribed for officers holding corresponding offices

in the public service.

It is noteworthy that in terms of section 32(3) of the Provincial

Councils Act, the Governor is not mandatorily required to follow

the schemes of recruitment prescribed by the Centre, but shall

endeavour as far as practicable to do so.

8

The reference to the Service Minutes of P3 and P4 in the

advertisements P2 and P17 can be attributed to the said

provision. That is to maintain the link between the National

Policy and the Provincial Policy and to give the message that the

Province is sensitive and aware of the Policy of the Centre and

not intentionally trying to deviate from it. Hence it can safely be

assumed that the Governor has been given considerable latitude

in certain aspects to strike a balance between the National Policy

and the unique needs of the Province and formulate a scheme to

address the issues peculiar to that Province.

It may be noted that as much as the Policy of the Centre

changes from time to time, such as, from Merit basis in P3 to

School basis in P4, the Provincial Policy on Divisional Secretariat

Division basis is not forever. That is the scheme of recruitment

to Teachers Service for the time being, which, according to the

Senior State Counsel for the respondents, has been introduced

to address the issue of dearth of teachers in identified difficult

schools and to maintain the continuity of service. The Southern

Provincial Council may have identified that issue as very unique

to them and may have thought it fit to address that issue in a

particular manner.

Another argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is

that the recruitment on Divisional Secretariat basis is basically

dependant on the place of birth which is discriminatory and

therefore contrary to Article 12(1) of the Constitution which

ensures right to equality. To meet that argument, the learned

Senior State Counsel for the respondents draws the attention of

Court to Article 12(4) of the Constitution which says that

9

Nothing in this Article shall prevent special provision being made,

by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, for the

advancement of women, children or disabled persons to justify

the impugned decision of the Southern Provincial Council which

was taken to address the issue relating to children, to be

specific, education of the children.

For the aforesaid reasons, I take the view that the main

argument of the counsel for the petitioners fails.

The next argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is

based on irrationality. There is no dispute that irrationality is a

ground for judicial review. The learned counsel says that the

Divisional Secretariat basis for recruitment is irrational and does

not provide an effective solution to the lack of teachers in rural

or difficult areas. The learned counsel argues that School basis

system introduced by the Centre by Service Minute marked P3 is

more logical and coherent. The learned Senior State Counsel in

that regard draws the attention of this Court to the Supreme

Court case of Sujeewa Arjuna Senasinghe v. Ajith Nivard

Cabraal1 where Sripavan J. (later C.J.) observed that The Court

cannot strike down a decision merely because it feels another

policy decision would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific

or logical. The Court is not expected to express its opinion as to

whether at a particular point of time or in a particular situation

any such decision should have been adopted or not. It is best left

to the discretion of the authority concerned.

1 SCFR 457/2012 minutes of the Supreme Court dated 18.09.2014

10

This Court is ill equipped and has no wherewithal or expert

knowledge or assistance to form an opinion which policy is best

suited to address the issue of dearth of teachers in difficult

areas in the Southern Province. Such attempt on the part of the

Court would fall outside the purview of the judicial review.

Unless the scheme of recruitment which has been decided to be

adopted is patently irrational, Court would be slow to interfere

with the exercise of the discretion merely because one party to

the action says that another policy is more effective than the

present one. (Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central

Environmental Authority2) I cannot bring myself to think that

the recruitment of graduates as teachers to serve in difficult

areas with continuity based on Divisional Secretariat basis is

outrageous or irrational.

The Judgment of the Supreme Court in Kamalawathie v. The

Provincial Public Service Commission, North Western Province3

cited by the learned counsel for the petitioners where it has been

held that While powers in respect of education have been

devolved to Provincial Councils, those powers must be exercised

in conformity with national policy. Once national policy has been

duly formulated in respect of any subject, there cannot be any

conflicting provincial policy on that subject, the facts are totally

different. In that case the teacher transfer policy set out in

Circular No.95/11 dated 31.03.1995 had been approved by the

Cabinet of Ministers as the national policy. In that circular it

has specifically been provided that transfers should be on the

recommendations of the duly established teacher transfer board.

2 [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 3 [2001] 1 Sri LR 1

11

However the impugned transfers had been effected without

recommendations of the teacher transfer board. Further in that

case there had not been an occasion to consider section 32(3) of

the Provincial Councils Act, which allows the Province to deviate

from the Centre to some extent.

Another argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners is

that P13 letter received by the petitioners, which I referred to

earlier, created a legitimate expectation in the petitioners that

they would be selected at least at the third stage but it was

nullified by advertisement P17 whereby fresh applications were

called to fill remaining vacancies without proceeding to the third

stage. Firstly, P13, in my view, does not specifically speaks

about a third stage but only first and second stages. Thereafter

P13 says that new vacancies created after the date relevant to

the annexure will also be filled without delay without specifically

stating that those vacancies will also be filled from the same

applicants. Secondly, when the second advertisement P17 was

placed, the applicable Service Minute was different, and places

of vacancies, number of vacancies etc. were also different.

For the aforesaid reasons, the application of the petitioners is

dismissed but without costs.
