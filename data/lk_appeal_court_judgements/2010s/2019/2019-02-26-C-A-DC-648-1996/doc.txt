DEFENDANT-RESPONDENTS

Before : M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

Counsel : Saliya Peiris P. C. for the 35A-35D Substituted

Defendant-Appellant

Reshani S. Seresinghe for the 23rd Substituted

Defendant-Respondent

Athula Perera with Vindya Divulwewa for the 27th

Defendant-Respondent

Written Submission Filed on : 10.02.2012 (by the 35A-35D Substituted Defendant-

Appellant) 10.01.2017, 09.10.2018 (by the 23rd Substituted

Defendant-Respondent) 26.09.2018 (by the 27th Defendant-Respondent) Decided on : 21.02.2019

M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

this partition action in the District Court of Horana to partition the land known

as Konduruwawatta alias Ambauyanawatta morefully described in the 2nd

schedule to the amended plaint dated 27.01.1989.

The said partition action had been so instituted, citing the 1st to 31st

Defendant-Respondents as parties thereto, and the 32nd to 50th Defendant-

Respondents were added as parties to the said action subsequently.

10

The 35th Defendant-Appellant filed his Statement of claim dated 07.03.1985

and 09.09.1988 and stated that he and the 48th Defendant-Respondent are

entitled to 1/8th share of the aforesaid land.

The trial of the case commenced on 27.10.1988 and on that day the learned

District Judge observed that the land described in the schedule to the plaint is

4 Acres but, the subject land which was surveyed is 2 Acres 1 Rood and 10.5

Perches. Thus, the learned District Judge ordered a commission to the Plaintiff

and directed to survey the entire land described in the plaint. Thereafter, the

Plaintiff filed an amended plaint on 27.01.1989.

At the beginning of the case both parties have admitted the corpus should be

Lot 1 to 4 in Preliminary Plan No. 972 dated 15.12.1982 and 02.03.1982

prepared by P. L. D. Fernando Licensed Surveyor described in the 2nd schedule

to the plaint (marked as X) and no dispute arose as to the original ownership

to the land by one Munasinghe Arachchige Pinthu Naide and Munasinghe

Arachchige Jonappu Naide (vide page 275, 290 & 291 of the appeal brief).

During the trial, a dispute arose among the Defendant-Respondents as to the

title of the land by Munasinghe Arachchige Jonappu Naide. The 23rd to 30th

and 36th Defendant-Respondents have claimed that they have earned the

rights through Angohamy who was the only child of Munasinghe Archchige

Jonappu Naide. But the 35th Defendant-Appellant had objected to this claim

by arguing that the said Angohamy was not the daughter of Jonappu Naide

but the wife of Hendrick who was the only child of Jonappu Naide.

Therefore, he further averred that the said Hendrick and Angohamy have

11

transferred their rights to Jagath Appu and Bastian and those rights have

evolved from them to the 35th Defendant and 48th Defendant-Respondent.

It is in these circumstances, at the trial only dispute between parties was

regard to the devolution of the title of Jonappu Naide and there was no

dispute between parties with regard to the corpus.

The learned District Judge on 05.03.1996 delivered the judgment accepting

the pedigree of the Plaintiff with regard to the rights of the original owner

Pinthu Naide, rejecting the claims of the 35th Defendant-Appellant, and also

accepting the pedigree of the 23rd-29th Defendant-Respondents with regard to

the rights of Jonappu Naide and made order to partition the land.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 35th Defendant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) preferred this appeal to set aside

the judgment and get the reliefs set out in the petition of appeal.

In the appeal, the position of the Appellants was that the said Jonappu Naide

died intestate leaving his only child Hendrick and said Hendrick married

Angohamy, to support of this version, the Appellant have evidence with

marking documents 35D1-25D4.

The Appellant further submitted that neither the Appellant himself nor the

23rd to 29th, 30A 36th Defendants-Respondents submitted a marriage

certificate or a birth certificate to support their versions. Therefore, he is in a

position that the learned District Judge erred when examining the title of the

parties.

12

However, I do not subscribe to the above view of the Appellant.

At this point, I wish to re-call the findings of Sinnetanby, J. in Cooray Vs.

Wijesuriya 62 NLR 158:

Before a Court can accept as correct a share which is stated in a

deed to belong to the vendor there must be clear and unequivocal

proof of how the vendor became entitled to that share. Apart

from proof by the production of birth, death and marriage

certificates, the relevant provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in

regard to proof of a pedigree are to be found in sections32 (5), 32

(6) and 60 (2).

Further, the following words of the Sinnetamby, J. are noteworthy:

The relevant provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to

proof of a pedigree are to be found in section 32 (5), section 32

(6) and section 50 (2) - I am omitting for the moment proof by the

production of birth, death and marriage certificates. It almost

always happens that birth and death certificates of persons who

have died very long ago are not available: in such cases the only

way of establishing relationship is by hearsay evidence. Section

32 (5) of the Evidence Ordinance renders a statement made by a

deceased person admissible:-

When the statement relates to the existence of any

relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption between

13

persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage, .or

adoption the person making the statement had special

means of knowledge, and when the statement was made

before the question in dispute was raised.

It is under this provision of law that oral evidence of pedigree is

generally sought to be led. What practitioners and the Court

sometimes lose sight of is the fact that before such evidence can

be led there must be proof that the hearsay evidence sought to

be given is in respect of a statement made by a person having

special means of knowledge; furthermore, it must have been

made ante litem motam . Where the statement is made by a

member of the family such knowledge may be inferred or even

presumed, but where it is a statement made by an outsider proof

of special means of knowledge must first be established.

Therefore, the above findings seem to me that, pedigree and oral statements

regarding a title are would be acceptable-evidence in a partition action. In the

case in hand, the learned District Judge also mindful on his duty to verify the

deeds and pedigrees of both parties to reach a conclusion that whether there

are conclusive evidence to determine the actual parties of the case.

In the circumstances, a careful perusal on the documents marked by the

Appellant (35D1-35D4) show that the boundaries described in the schedule to

the deeds are not tally and not refer to the land sought to be partitioned.

While, the conclusion of the learned District Judge regarding the deeds (24D1-

24D3) submitted by the 23rd to 30th and 36th Defendant-Respondents are in

14

respect of the land sought to be partitioned is correct and according to the

evidence adduced at the trial. Therefore, I hold that the learned Judge has

correctly held in this regard.

It is clear accustomed legal rule that in a civil action the standard of proof is

balance of probability. [Vide: Rhesa Shipping Vs. Edmunds (1985) 1 WLR 948

(House of Lords); Davies Vs. Taylor (1972) 3 WLR 801 Golagoda Vs. Mohideen

(1937) 40 NLR 92; and Wijeyaratne and Another Vs. Somawathie (2002) 1 SLR

93]. Having concentrated the standard of proof in a civil suit, it is also

important to note that (as has been stated by the Supreme Court and this

Court in several precedents before), the duty of the Court in a partition action

is primarily to investigate the title of the parties to the case to its satisfaction.

In this context it is important to recall the words of Bonser C.J in the case of

Peris Vs. Perera, (1896) 1 NLR 36:

It is obvious that the court ought not to make a decree, except it

is perfectly satisfied that the persons in whose favour it makes

the decree are entitled to the property. The court should not, as it

seems to me, regard these actions as merely to be decided on

issues raised by and between the parties.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the learned District Judge has

correctly evaluated the evidence put forward in the trial.

Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the judgment dated 05.03.1996.

15

I would dismiss the appeal without Cost.

Appeal dismissed.
