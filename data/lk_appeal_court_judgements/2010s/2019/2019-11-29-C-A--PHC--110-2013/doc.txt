Act No. 44 of 1979, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in the Magistrates Court of

Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioners, (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) over

the possession of business premises in dispute named "Langeoog Inn". The ,

learned Magistrate by order dated 18/07/20 11, held that the possession of the said

disputed premises be handed over to the Respondent. The Petitioners being

aggrieved by the said order filed a Revision application in the Provincial High

Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle. By order dated 1711112016, the

learned High Court Judge of Galle, dismissed the application on a preliminary

objection based on delay, without considering the merits of the case. It is from that

order the Petitioners are before this Court.

The learned High Court Judge upheld the preliminary objection, taking into

consideration a delay of 3 months as undue delay on the part of the Petitioners and

dismissed the application without going into the merits of the case.

The facts pertaining to this case briefly are, that the Respondent was

appointed as manager by a contract marked 2R3, to conduct business affairs of

"Langeoog Inn" by the 1st Petitioner and one Andrea Kendziora-Kuhn, acting as

business partner. The said Andrea Kendziora-Kuhn, is not a party to this action. It

is alleged that the dispute over possession arose, when the said Andrea Kendziora-

Kuhn lodged a complaint in the Habaraduwa Police to restrain the Petitioners

entering the property in dispute, which culminated in the filling of the information

in the Magistrates Court of Galle.

The Petitioners submit that the learned Magistrate having come to a correct

conclusion that the dispute was between the 1st Appellant and the said Andrea

Kendziora-Kuhn has erred in law in the said order by handing over possession to

the Respondent, who is an employee of the Petitioners. The Respondent admits

that from mid-year 2000, he was the manager of the said hotel and is an employee

of the Petitioners. It is also admitted that the 1st Petitioner is resident in Sri Lanka

during the 'season'. Explaining the alleged delay, the Petitioners submit that due

to circumstances beyond their control, the 1st Petitioner was out of the country,

when the learned Magistrate delivered the order and therefore, the delay of 3

months should not be considered as fatal.

In the said circumstances, the Petitioners argue that the delay of 3 months

will not operate as a bar for this Court to act in revision to set aside the order,

which has caused a miscarriage of justice and which is ex facie wrong.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners has referred to

Priyanthi Perera Samarasinghe Vs. Dharmapa/a Colin Abeywardene CA (PHC)

APN 6412010, decided on 0510512011, where Justice Sisira de Abrew at page 7,

held as follows;

"Learned Counsel for the Respondent contended that the present Petition should

be dismissed on the ground of delay (delay 2 ~ half years) and non-establishment

of exceptional circumstances. In my view, delay in bringing a case before court

will not operate as a bar for the Court of Appeal, in revision, to set aside an order

which is wrong. I have earlier held that the order of the learned High Court Judge

is ex facie wrong and the Petitioner had suffered a miscarriage of justice. I hold

that when a party has suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of an order of

the lower court which is ex facie wrong such facts can be considered as an

exceptional ground to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Superior Courts. "

At the hearing before us, the learned Counsel for the Respondent contended

that the delay of 3 months is not explained. The learned Counsel in support cited

the case of The Attorney-General Vs. Kunchihambu et al. 46 NLR 401. In this

case the Supreme Court considered whether it should exercise its powers of

revision under Section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Code, when Section 338 of

the Criminal Procedure Code provided a right of Appeal, which should be resorted

to. However, the case before this Court deals with the question whether, delay ' per

se' is justified in dismissing an action, where the Petitioners allege that they have

been denied of an opportunity to canvass the merits of the case. Therefore, the

instant case can be clearly distinguished from the case cited by the learned

Counsel.

In Lulu Balakumar Vs. Balasingham (1997) BLR 22 SC, Fernando J.

held that "the mere delay does not automatically amount to laches, and that the

circumstances of the particular case, the reasons for the delay, and impact of the

delay on the other party, must all be taken into account. "

His Lordship further stated that;

"In this case there was a delay offour months, which in the context of litigation in

Sri Lanka is by no means unusual although, I hasten to add, undesirable and not

to be encouraged. "

Therefore the question to be decided is twofold; ie, is the delay of 3 months

justified and if so, should this matter be referred back to the learned High Court

Judge to make a determination on the merits of the case.

It is observed that the Respondent was in the premises in his capacity as

manager of the hotel, by virtue of a contract. It is also observed that the Special

Power of Attorney given to the Respondent by the said Andrea Kendzior-Kuhn

was restricted to manage and transact business affairs of the said Andrea

Kendzior-Kuhn. The Respondent in his statement to the police clearly states that,

he was the manager of the said hotel. Therefore, the facts and the circumstances

clearly manifest that the learned Magistrate has erred in law by handing over

possession of the hotel to the Respondent, who was acting under a contract of

employment in the capacity of a licensee of the Petitioner.

In the circumstances, discussed above, I do not think that this IS an

application to be discontinued simply on the ground of delay.

Therefore, r find that the Petitioners are entitled to canvass the order of the

learned Magistrate before the learned High Court Judge, on the merits of the ,

application, if deprived, would cause grave injustice to the Petitioners.

Therefore, r set aside the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 30107/2013, and direct that this case be listed at the earliest possible date for

argument and dispose of the application on its merits.

Application allowed.
