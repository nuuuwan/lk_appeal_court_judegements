A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J.

Chula Bandara with s.c. Samarakoon for the 12A Defendant, Appellant in CA 461100 and the llA Defendant' Appellant in CA 462/00

M.C. Jayaratne with M.D.]. Bandara for the Plaintiff, Respondent

28.08.20l8

The Plaintiff' Respondent above named (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Plaintiff") instituted the action bearing No.7502/P in the District Court of

Kuliyapitiya against 1st to 12th Defendant,Respondents seeking to partition a land called

"Vijjakarayagewatta" and "Kongahayaya" situated at Hamanna Pahuwa in an extent of 6 acres

and 39 perches (A:6 R:O P:39) as more fully described in the schedule to the plaint.

While denying several averments in the said plaint of the Respondent, 5th Defendant'

Respondent and the nth and Ith Defendant'Appellants above named filed their separate

statements of claims and prayed for, inter alia, that:,

a. the Lot 1 in Plan No.750 be excluded or in the alternative an undivided 5/10 be

allotted to the 5th Defendant, Respondent,see Statement of Claim of the 5th

Defendant, Appellant;

b. the dismissal of the action of the Plaintiff or in the alternative Lot 3A in Plan No.l612

be allotted to the nth Defendant,Appellant,see Statement of Claim of the nth

Defendant, Appellant;

c. the dismissal of the action of the Plaintiff or in the alternative an undivided

2517/3996 be allotted to the 12th Defendant,Appellant,see Statement of Claim of the

12th Defendant, Appellant.

Upon the above pleadings, the trial commenced 09.l0.l995 and the Plaintiff raised Issues

Nos.l~2, whilst Issue Nos.3A, Nos.5~8 and Nos.9~11 were raised respectively on behalf of

the 5th Defendant, 11th Defendant and 12th Defendant~ Appellants. The Plaintiff Keerthiratne

gave evidence himself and closed his case by producing documents marked X, Y, PI, P2

and P3 on 03.02.1997 and the 5th Defendant~Respondent gave evidence for herself and did

not produce any documentary evidence on her behalf. On 11.l2.l998, the 11th Defendant~

Appellant gave evidence for himself and called another witness and closed his case by

producing documents marked llVl, llV2, Xl and Yl and on 17.07.1999, the 12th Defendant~

Appellant gave evidence for himself and closed his case by producing documents marked

l2Vl and as he had asserted in his statement of claim was based on prescription. But no

other witness was called to substantiate his claim of prescription. After the conclusion of

the trial and tendering of the written submissions of the respective parties, the learned

District Judge of Kuliyapitya pronounced his judgment dated 28.07.2000 allowing the

partition of the land in question~see page 217 of the appeal brief.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 28.07.2000, the 11th and 12th Defendant~Appellants

preferred these appeals bearing Nos.461/2000(F) and 462/2000(F) and both Counsel made

oral submissions and submitted written submissions in order to support their cases.

The title had devolved on the original owners by a land settlement order and it would

appear that when the Plaintiff marked in evidence the documents X, Y, PI, P2 and P3 they

were all admitted without any demur by the Defendants inclusive of the 11th and 12th

Defendant~ Appellants. This confirmed the title to the land devolving form the crown and

therefore, once the paper title is proved, it is the burden on the part of the 11th and 1th

Defendant~ Appellants to prove their superior title by way of prescription and it was the

contention of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff~Respondent Mr. M.D]. Bandara that

the 11th and 12th Defendant~Appellants were not able to discharge their burden. The

learned Counsel pointed out that there was no overt act on the part of the 11th and 12th

Defendant~ Appellants to establish ouster of the other co~owners such as the Plaintiff~

Respondent.

As was quite succinctly pinpointed in Maria Fernando and Another v. Anthony

Fernando (1997) 2 Sri LR 356:~

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of produce, filing suit without making the

adverse party, a party, preparing plan and bUilding house on land and renting it are not enough to

establish prescription among co,owners in the absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to

prescribe may not amount to ouster."

Neither the nth Defendant~Appellant nor the 12th Defendant~Appellant offered any

evidence to demonstrate a starting point from which prescription would have begun. On

the other hand they admitted co~ownership when the Plaintiff produced his documentary

evidence.

The learned Counsd for the nth Defendant~Appellant Mr. Chula Bandara put forward the

following arguments at the hearing.

a. the learned District Judge has failed to take into account the fact that the nth

Defendant~Appellant has established his right of prescription to the specific lot 3A

depicted in Plan No.l612 (Xl);

b. that the Plaintiff's title originally deriving from Pavada &:: Sandanam Nadachchi, in

equal shares has not been proved;

c. that the identification of the corpus referred to in the schedule to the plaint has not

been established.

I would not venture to comment on the first argument as I have already dealt with the

issue of prescription. The nth and 12th Defendant Appellants accepted the co~ownership

deriving from Sandanam Nadachchi and the land settlement order which bestowed

ownership was produced and marked as PI at the trial, without any objections from the

Appellants. The parties remained co~owners and not a tittle of evidence was available at

the trial to demonstrate that a superior title such as prescription had put an end to co~

ownership.

5

According to Issues Nos.5, 6, & 7 of the 11th Defendant~Appellant raised on 09.l0.l995, he

took the stance that lot 3A in Plan No.l612 (Xl), which is depicted as lot 3 in preliminary

Plan No.750 (X), had been possessed by as a distinct and discrete entity and by virtue of

that alleged exclusive possession, he had claimed a prescriptive title to Lot 3A. But as I

said, no evidence of prescriptive title emanating from adverse possession was proffered

before the court a quo and merely because parties have possessed distinct lots for

convenience, it does not give rise to adverse possession as was pronounced in Dona

Cecma v. Cecma Perera & Others (1987) 1 Sri LR at 235~ 239; 1 CALR 26 (SC):~

"Where a land is divided with the consent of all the co,owners but no cross,conveyances are executed

in respect of the lots, co,ownership terminates only after undisturbed, uninterrupted and exclusive

possession of the divided lots for a period of over ten years ......... although the plan of division was not

signed by the co,owners and no cross,conveyances were executed, with ten years of such possession

the co,owners would acquire prescriptive title to their respective lots ......... "

In the instant case, the arrangement proposed as per Plan No.l612 (Xl), tendered by the

Appellant has not been executed at all. Even without the execution of the plan there could

be prescriptive title but no evidence was forthCOming to establish undisturbed,

uninterrupted and exclusive possession. It is trite that a secret intention to prescribe may

not amount to ouster. Thus upon a consideration of the totality of evidence I conclude that

the Appellant cannot claim any prescription to the said lot 3 in Plan No.750 (X).

The learned Counsel Mr. M.D.]. Bandara argued that it was too late in the day for the

Counsel for the Appellants to raise on~identification of the corpus at the hearing of the

appeal. The argument on non~identification of the corpus was taken up by the Counsel for

the Appellant, for first time at the hearing of this appeal. The parties went on the basis

that the preliminary survey plan reflected the corpus described in the schedule to the

plaint and the trial has been conducted on the identicality of the corpus.

It was held in the case of Gunawardena v. Deraniyagala (2010) 1 Sri LR at page 309:~

"According to our procedure it is not open to a party to put forward a ground for the first in appeal,

if the said point has not been raised at the trial under the issues so framed."

6

a

The nth Defendant~Appellant would be estopped to raise non~identification of the corpus

as it was his case that he claimed Lot 3 in the preliminary Plan bearing No.750 (X)~see

Issue No.7 raised at the trial. His claim of prescriptive title was raised in respect of Lot 3 in

the preliminary plan and now he cannot blow hot and cold. The preliminary plan has been

accepted without demur.

The substituted nth Defendant, namely W.A. Premasiri Jayasundera accepted the said

preliminary Plan No.750 (X) at page 1 thus:~

~ ~U!S5 ~ ~CS exM~Ol: l:eD@ ~~) @IDd? o lil!)

o lil!)

Thus this Court cannot find a dispute as regards a discrepancy between the land described

in the schedule to the plaint and the land depicted in the preliminary plan.

In the circumstances I conclude that there is no merit in the two appeals that have been

preferred to this Court and I proceed to affirm the judgment of the District Court of

Kurunegala dated 28.07.2000 and dismiss the appeals.
