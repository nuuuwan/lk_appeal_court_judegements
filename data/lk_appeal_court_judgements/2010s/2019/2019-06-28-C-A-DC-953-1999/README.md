A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. The learned President's Counsel for the Substituted Plaintiff~ Respondent raised a

preliminary objection to the maintainability of this appeal at the very outset when

the matter was taken up for argument.

1) Mr. Chandrasena Attorney~at~Law had filed the proxy on behalf of the r t

Defendant~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as" the 1st Defendant" or

the "Appellant").

2) On 23.11.l999 the petition of appeal was filed in the District Court on behalf of the

1st Defendant~Appellant by a different Attorney~at~Law namely one Mr. Piyaratne

Bandara.

In other words whilst a proxy of one Mr. Chandrasena, AAL was on record, another

Attorney~at~Law called Mr. Piyaratne Bandara filed both the notice of appeal as well as

the petition of appeal.

Mr. W. Dayaratne, PC contended on behalf of the substituted Plaintiff~Respondent that

since this procedure is contrary to the Civil Procedure Code the petition of appeal is bad

in law and the appeal must be rejected. Mr. Vijith Singh for the 1st Defendant~Appellant

argued that the proxy given by the 1st Defendant to Mr. Piyarathne Bandara restricted

him to fileonly the petition of appeal and further contended that notwithstanding the 2nd

proxy, the power of the 1st proxy holder remained in force.

Both counsel acknowledged the legal proposition that has stood for years namely two

proxies could not exist side by side for a party. The cases which affirmed the legal

principle have laid down that no Attorney~at~Law other than the Attorney who is on

record could file the notice and petition of appeal~see See1awathie v. Jayasinghe (1985) 2

Sri LR. 260; Fernando v. Fernando (1997) 3 Sri LR. p.l.

In fact Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code states that:~

Section 27(1) of the Civil Procedure Code states that, "The appointment of a registered

attorney to make any appearance or application, or do any act as aforesaid, shall be in

2

writing signed by the client and shall be filed in court; and every such appointment shall

contain an address at which service of any process which under provisions of this

Chapter (Chapter V) may be served on a registered attorney, instead of the party whom

he represents, may be made.

When so filed, the proxy shall be in force until revoked with the leave of the court and

after notice to the registered attorney by a writing signed by the client and filed in court,

or until the client dies or until the registered attorney dies, is removed, or suspended, or

otherwise becomes incapable to act, or until all proceedings in the action are ended and

judgment satisfied so far as regards the client (Section 27(2) of the Code).

These provisions have been interpreted by our Courts from early times,see Letchumanan

v. Christian 4 N.LR 323 which proclaimed that a recognized agent appointed by a party

to a case such as an Attorney'at,law can be named even at a later stage. In this case the

Plaintiff had by an oversight omitted to insert the name of the proctor in his proxy. The

Court held that the proper course to adopt in such a case was not to order the plaint to

be taken off the file, and cast the Plaintiff in costs, but to supply the omission then and

there and proceed with the case in due course,see Treahy v. Bawa 7 N.LR 22.

As regards Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, the Supreme Court in Fernando v.

Fernando (1997) 3 Sri LR 1 held that a proxy is valid until all proceedings in the action

are ended and judgment is satisfied.

In MM HaniEfa v. A.M Idroos 2015 BLR 24, it was held that a revision and leave to

appeal application could be initiated by another new Attorney,at,Law other than the

registered Attorney on record, which does not form a step in the proceedings of the

original court.

In Jeevani Investments v. Wfjesena Perera (2005) 3 Sri LR 350 citing Saravanapavan's

case (1984) 1 Sri LR 268 the Court held that appellate proceedings are a continuation of

proceedings commenced in the original court.

3

I had occasion to cite a slew of cases such as the above in the case of Serasundara v.

KKG. DyaneiusCA 1423/99 (CA minutes of 24.04.2016).

This follows that no appeal could be filed by a new Attorney-at-Law as it is the

continuation of the original case. Justice Eva Wanasundera in Haniffa's case (supra) held

that there cannot be two contracts of agency as the Civil Procedure Code limits agency

to one registered Attorney-at-Law.

As the relationship between a client and an Attorney-at-Law is one of an agency, the

question arises as to whether this power to take steps right throughout could be

restricted by the client only to litigate in the District Court without giving the power to

prefer an appeal.

Mr. Vijith Singh cited the case of Mohideen Ali v. Hassim 62 N.L.R 457 at 459 to

advance the argument that an authority granted by a lay client to his proctor in writing

can be limited. In fact Basnayake, c.J stated at p 459:-

"A (proxy) undoubtedly limits the proctor's authority. He cannot go counter to it; but I do not

think that it can be said that the writing is exhaustive of his powers nor is the lay client precluded

from enlarging the scope of the powers granted by writing either expressly or impliedly. Such

extension of the proctor's authority may be given orally or may be inferred from the lay client's

conduct."

In the circumstances of this case the authority/power given to the Attorney in the

District Court on the proxy given to him, was restricted to the District Court

proceedings by writing and the conduct of the client in as much as a new proxy was

given to a different Attorney to prefer an appeal.

I do not for a moment gainsay the ability of the client to enlarge or limit the powers

granted to his Attorney-at-Law but if one peruses the powers granted to the two

Attorneys-at-Law in their respective proxies, they are coterminous and grant similar

powers. Whilst the proxy given to Ms. Chandrasena who has filed the notice of appeal

and petition of appeal grants her powers all the way up to execution, the proxy given to

4

Piyarathne Bandara also covers the same aspects of litigation. There is no express

limitation of Piyarathna Bandara in that his remit of acts has been restricted to the

original court. Mr. Vijith Singh quite ingeniously argued that when the District Court

accepted the proxy of the 2ndAttorney to file notice and petition of appeal without the

power of the 1st Attorney being revoked, the District Court had sanctioned the 2nd

Attorney to function. Though I accept the contention that the power of an Attorney

could be limited or expanded, the District Court cannot bring about the limitation or

expansion as Courts do not rewrite contracts for parties more particularly those

contracts such as proxies that govern the terms of employment of an Attorney~at~Law

except in the case of a revocation where the leave of court is required by the Civil

Procedure Code.

The Courts have insisted on embargo of two registered Attorneys as the last paragraph of

Section 27(2) refers to the effective validity of the r t proxy lasting until all proceedings in

the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far ss regards the client.

Mr. Vijith Singh contended that this terminal point of the relationship can be written by

the client and the 1st Registered Attorney. He cited the Supreme Court decision of In

Hatton National Bank Ltd, v. Helenluc Garmens Ltd, (1999) 2 Sri LR. 365 wherein

the legality of the waiver of the Prescription Ordinance made by the 2nd and 6th

defendants in the case was considered by the Supreme Court. The 2nd and 6th defendants

in the case were the guarantors who had agreed in the guarantee to waive the defence of

prescription. The Court held that such a waiver was valid. Th 2nd and 6th defendants had

agreed in clause 16 of the guarantee that "we and each of us hereby agree that so long as

the monies herein mentioned or any part thereof is owed by the customer to the bank or

has not already been paid to the bank by the customer or by us the liability of us and

each of us to pay same shall subsist and the monies herein mentioned shall be recoverable

from and be the liability of us and each of us jointly and severally notwithstanding

anything to the contrary herein or in any rule of law or equity or the Prescription

Ordinanceor any statute contained and we hereby further agree that we or any of us shall

not pleadthe Prescription Ordinance or any of its provisions or any rule of statute or

5

other law is a bar to the Bank suing us or anyone of us for the recovery of the monies

herein mentioned or any part thereof".

In his well~established text, The Law of Contract Volume II Dr. Weeramantry (in

Section 844 at page 797) states under the heading: "agreements not to plead limitation"

that "it is not contrary to public policy for the parties to enter into an agreement not to

plead limitation. Such an agreement is valid and enforceable in English law if supported

by consideration, whether it is made before or after the limitation period has expired.

The same observation holds good for our law, except that an agreement may not be

supported by consideration. "

It was in this background that Dheeraratne, J. said in the above case that the parties can

contract out of the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance. Assuming without

conceding that it is not contrary to public policy that a Registered Attorney and his

client can contract out of Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, no such contracting

out took place between the Attorney Ms. Chandrasena and the 1st Defendant to the effect

that Ms. Chandrasena was prohibited from filing a notice and the subsequent petition of

appeal.

In the circumstances I take the view that the the 2nd Attorney was prohibited from filing

a notice and a petition of appealas it was only the r t Attorney who had been empowered

to perform all these acts on behalf of the 1st Defendant~Appellant.

From the foregoing I would uphold the preliminary objection that this appeal cannot be

maintained and accordingly I proceed to dismiss this appeal.
