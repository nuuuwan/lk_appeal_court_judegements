The Officer-in-Charge of the Kahathuduwa Police filed information in

terms of the provisions contained in Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in the

Magistrates Court of Kesbewa against the 1 st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-

Page 2 of 6

, Appellant and the 1st party-Intervenient-Respondent-Petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellant) and the 2nd party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) alleging that the Respondent had

forcibly entered the paddy field called 'Helapathamulla Kumbura' and

dispossessed the Appellants from the said paddy land in dispute. The learned

Magistrate by order dated 25/08/20 11 , held that the possession of the disputed

land be handed over to the Respondent. The Appellants aggrieved by the said

order, filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Panadura. By order dated 29/0412013, the learned High Court

Judge ofPanadura, dismissed the application of the Appellants. It is the said order

that the Appellants are seeking to canvass by this application.

The main contention of the Appellants are that the Court by not identifying

the disputed corpus has granted relief which has not been prayed for by the

Respondent and therefore, has urged Court to set aside the order of the Magistrates

Court of Kesbewa and the High Court ofPanadura, which affirmed the said order.

The Appellants submit that, 2 complains were made to the Kahatuduwa

Police Station stating that the Respondent had forcibly entered the paddy field

called 'Pandiya Kumbura' and 'Helapathamulla Kumbura' on or about 26/06/2010

and 12/04/2011 respectively, which are owned and possessed by them. The

Appellants point out that according to the inquiry report dated 01/05/20 II , the

Page 3 of 6

Respondent has claimed only a land in extent of' 5 Lahas' of paddy sowing area of '

the paddy land called 'Helapathamulla Kumbura' which is in extent of 1 Acre.

The Appellants by affidavit dated 09/06/20 II , (at page 88 of the brief)

sought to be placed in possession of the lands called' Pandiya Kumbura' in extent

of 2 Bushels of paddy sowing area and the land called 'Helapathamulla Kumbura'

in extent of I Acre, more fully described in the schedule to the said affidavit.

In the affidavit dated 25/05/2011, (at page 72 of the brief), the Respondent

describes 2 different lands in the two schedules as 'Helapathamulla Kumbura',

The land described in the 2nd schedule is in extent of 5 Lahas of paddy sowing

area. In the said affidavit the Respondents have prayed for possession of the land

described in the 2nd schedule. The Respondents in their counter affidavit dated

23/0612011, (at page 132 of the brief) describes an additional land called 'Pandiya

Kumbura' in extent of 1 Rood in the 3rd schedule, which is an addition to the lands

described in the 1 st and 2nd schedules. By the said counter affidavit, the

Respondents claim possession of 'Helapathamulla Kumbura' in extent of 5 Lahas

of paddy sowing area and the land called 'Pandiya Kumbura' in extent of 1 Rood.

,the lands described in the 2nd and 3 rd schedules,

The lands described in the 1 st and 2nd schedules refer to a land called

'Helapathamulla Kumbura'. However, it is observed that the boundaries and the

extents of the lands so described are not the same. The land described in the 2nd

Page 4 of 6

schedule is in extent of 5 Lahas of paddy sowing area, which the Respondent

claims to be in possession.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has cited the case of Ratnayake Vs.

Kumarihamy (2002) 1 SLR 65, where Weerasooriya 1. held that "one Laha of

paddy sowing area is equivalent to 10 perches. " Accordingly, the Appellants

contend that by the impugned order the Court has placed the Respondent in

possessIOn of 160 perches of land instead of 50 perches claimed by them.

Therefore, the learned Counsel submits that the said order has placed the

Respondent in possession in extent of 160 perches instead of the 50 perches

claimed by him. It was the stand of the Respondent that he cleared the forest and

cultivated the land in extent of 5 Lahas described in the 2nd schedule of the

affidavit. In paragraph 3(x) of the said affidavit dated 25/05/20 II , the Respondent

has clearly stated as follows;

"3 (x) @Oe:! (f)-e1Q25)oiJd fiJe:!@e:! d@ !SJl(J@c:Ji:ff @!SJoue:!d !SJoo d(g @o@erJ(g @!SJOU

However, by the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has given

possession to the Respondent of the entirety of the land called 'Helapathamulla

Kumbura' described in the I st schedule, which is in extent of I acre. It is observed

that the learned Magistrate has clearly fai led to identify the corpus described in the

Page 5 of 6

l Sl and 2nd schedules as 2 lands referred to as ' Helapathamulla Kumbura' and in

that premise has erred in identifYing the disputed land as 'Helapathamulla

Kumbura' and thereby has placed the Respondent in possession of a land in extent

of l Acre which was never the subject matter of this dispute.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the impugned order of the

learned Magistrate and the order of the learned High Court Judge should be set

aside forthwith.

Application allowed. I order no costs.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.
