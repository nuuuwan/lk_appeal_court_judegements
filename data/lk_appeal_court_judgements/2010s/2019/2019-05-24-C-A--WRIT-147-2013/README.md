Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this application was taken up for argument on 30th July 2018, the

learned President's Counsel appearing for the Petitioner and the learned

Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Respondents moved that this

Court deliver its judgment on the written submissions that would be tendered

by the parties.

The Petitioner, having joined the 1st Respondent University of Jaffna as an

Assistant Lecturer (Probationary) in Economics on 1st January 1990, is presently

serving the 1st Respondent as an Associate Professor in Economic Statistics

attached to the Department of Economics.

Being dissatisfied with the decision of the 1st Respondent, University of Jaffna

in not appointing him as a Professor, and the order of the University Services

Appeals Board (USAB) refusing the appeal lodged against the said decision, the

Petitioner filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the order delivered by the USAB on 1ih

March 20131;

2. Writs of Mandamus on the 2nd - 26th Respondents:

a) To promote the Petitioner to the post of Professor with effect from

29th November 2005;

1 A copy of the said Order has been annexed to the petition marked 'G'.

6

b) To antedate the Petitioner's promotion to the post of Senior Lecturer

Grade II from 1st December 1997 to 1st January 1995;

c) To antedate the Petitioner's promotion to the post of Senior Lecturer

Grade I from 1st December 2003 to 1st January 2001.

This Court would first like to layout the parametres within which Courts have

previously acted when it was faced with decisions by academic institutions.

In Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth2, it has been pointed out that

Courts will be reluctant to enter into ((issues of academic or pastoral judgment

which the University was equipped to consider in breadth and in depth but on

which any judgment of the Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That

undoubtedly included such questions as what mark or class a student ought to

be awarded or whether an aegrotat was justified."

In Abevsundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara vs University of

Colombo and others3 this Court, having considered several English cases in this

regard, held as follows:

((The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie

within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities,

the Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any

decision taken by them in connection therewith. Unless a decision is

demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable, their province and

authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want

2 Oxford, Eleventh Edition, page 537.

3 CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA Minutes of 8th June 2018.

7

of judicially manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess,

scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.

Dealing with the scope of interference in matters relating to orders

passed by the authorities of educational institutions, the Courts should

normally be very slow to pass orders in regard thereto and such matters

should normally be left to the decision of the educational authorities. This

is not an inflexible rule though and in R v. Higher Education Funding

Council ex parte Institute of Dental Surgerl Stephen Sedley J took care to

emphasize the flexibility of the rule: 'This is not to say for a moment that

academic decisions are beyond challenge..... A mark, for example,

awarded at an examiners' meeting where irrelevant and damaging

personal factors have been allowed to enter into the evaluation of a

candidate's written paper is something more than an informed exercise of

academic judgment."'

The Supreme Court, in Dr. Karunananda v. Open University of Sri Lanka and

OthersS was called upon to consider whether the petitioner's fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) had been infringed by the refusal of the

Open University to promote the petitioner as a Professor. Incidentally, the

Circular that was the subject matter of that application is the same circular

that this Court needs to consider in this application.

In the said case, the Supreme Court, in response to the argument of the

University that the decision whether to confer a professorship could be

executed only by persons who are qualified and placed in equal or higher

4 1994) 1 WLR 242. 5(2006) 3 SLR 225

8

standing and accordingly, an application seeking appointment as a Professor,

could only be assessed by similarly qualified peers from the academic

community having an 'academic mind' and that such evaluations may not be

on par with the reasoning of a judicial mind, held as follows:

"Therefore, although there may be cautionary remarks, indicating

reluctance to enter into academic judgment, I am not in agreement with

the view that academic decisions are beyond challenge. There is no

necessity for the Courts to unnecessarily intervene in matters "purely of

academic nature," since such issues would be best dealt with by

academics, who are 'fully equipped' to consider the question in hand.

However, if there are allegations against decisions of academic

establishments that fall under the category stipulated in terms of Article

126 of the Constitution, there are no provisions to restrain this Court from

examining an alleged violation relating to an infringement or imminent

infringement irrespective of the fact that the said violation is in relation to

a decision of an academic establishment."

This Court is therefore of the view that in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested

in it by Article 140 of the Constitution, it can examine whether the impugned

decision of the 1st Respondent is illegal, irrational or procedurally improper but

would exercise extreme caution if asked to consider, for example whether the

Petitioner is entitled to more marks than what has actually been given by the

examiners.

9

This Court will first consider the facts relating to the decision of the 1st

Respondent not to promote the Petitioner to the post of Professor and the

order of the USAB in respect of such decision.

By Circular No. 723 dated 1ih December 1997 annexed to the petition marked

iA48', the University Grants Commission had approved the scheme of

recruitment contained in the said Circular for the posts of Associate Professor,

Professor and Senior Professor in the University System. It is observed that the

scheme of recruitment set out in Circular No. 723 seeks to ensure uniformity in

the selection of persons to be promoted to the post of Associate Professor and

Professor across all Universities in Sri Lanka. The said scheme had come into

effect on 1st January 1998 and had been valid, until it was replaced by Circular

No. 869 dated 30th November 2005, which came into effect on 1st December

2005.6

According to Circular No. 723, a Senior Lecturer Grade I or Grade II may be

considered for promotion to the grade of Associate Professor or Professor if he

or she has obtained at least the minimum mark specified in the marking

scheme contained in the said Circular. The marking scheme for selection to the

posts of Associate Professor and Professor had been set out in an Annex to the

said Circular and contained three sections under which a candidate was

marked. The annex also specified the minimum mark that a candidate was

required to obtain for each section and the minimum aggregate mark that an

applicant should obtain in order to qualify for the relevant appointment.

Details of the aforementioned sections and the minimum marks that should be

obtained are set out in the following table.

6 A copy of Circular No. 869 has been annexed to the petition, marked 'A48a'.

Section 3.2 Contribution to University

Total 65 90

In terms of Circular No. 723, an application for merit promotion should be

accompanied by the following:

a) Curriculum vitae of the applicant;

b) A self assessment of the candidate's whole career specifying the

contribution made in respect of each of the above sections;

c) Two copies of the publications, research papers and other relevant

documents.

11

The Circular also sets out the manner of evaluating each application that is

received by the relevant University. Accordingly, the Senate shall appoint two

External Experts in the relevant field from outside the higher educational

institution concerned, to evaluate the applicants' contribution under Sections

2 and 3.1. The evaluation of the contribution under Sections 1 and 3.2 is

carried out by a panel appointed by the Senate consisting of the Vice

Chancellor or the Dean of the relevant Faculty, and two Professors, one of

whom is either from within or outside the institution concerned but has

knowledge of the discipline or related discipline relating to the applicant, and

the other person from another faculty of the same higher educational

institution as the applicant. The final selection shall be made by the Selection

Committee based on the independent evaluation reports submitted by the

evaluators referred to above.

This Court observes at the outset that the scheme of evaluation set out in

Circular No. 723 seeks to ensure that an application for a post such as

Associate Professor or Professor is examined by those persons who have the

expertise in the relevant discipline as that of the applicant or of the work

carried out by the applicant. This is confirmed when one considers the fact that

of the 90 marks that are required to be appointed as a Professor,

approximately 60 marks must come from the External Experts. Similarly, of the

65 marks required to become an Associate Professor, approximately 35 marks

would have to be allotted by the External Experts. Even with regard to Sections

1 and 3.2, the Panel will have at least one person from the particular discipline.

Therefore, any deviation from this requirement of having experts in the area of

the candidate evaluating the application of the said candidate would be

outside Circular No. 723 and can be unreasonable by the applicant.

12

The Petitioner had submitted his application for merit promotion to Professor /

Associate Professor of Economic Statistics on 29th November 2005. Copies of

the covering letter and the application have been annexed to the petition

marked as 'A26a' and 'A26b' respectively. According to the self assessment

carried out by the Petitioner, the Petitioner had claimed that he is entitled to

the following marks:

Section 1 Section 2 Section 3.1 Section 3.2 Total

29 marks 141 marks 42 marks 9 marks 221

It would thus be clear that according to the Petitioner's assessment of himself,

he had earned sufficient marks to be eligible to be appointed as a Professor.

The Petitioner had however only been appointed as an Associate Professor on

the basis that he had not obtained sufficient marks to be appointed as a

Professor. Being dissatisfied with the said decision, the Petitioner filed an

appeal with the USAB against the said decision. The USAB, having afforded the

Petitioner and the Respondents a hearing, had dismissed the appeal of the

Petitioner. This application was filed thereafter, seeking the aforementioned

relief.

The Petitioner has complained to this Court that the USAB failed to consider

the several irregularities that are said to have been committed by the

Respondents in the evaluation of his application as well as in the allocation of

marks to him, inspite of the Petitioner having placed the necessary material to

substantiate the said irregularities. The Petitioner is therefore claiming that the

decision of the USAB is illegal, irrational and unreasonable. This Court must

13

observe at this stage that the detailed mark sheet of the Selection Committee

had not been filed by the 1st Respondent before the USAB. A copy thereof had

only been tendered to this Court with the counter affidavit, pursuant to same

being made available to the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent, after the filing of

the Statement of Objections. The failure to submit the mark sheet to the USAB

has in effect deprived the USAB of making a considered decision in respect of

the irregularities said to have been committed by the Selection Committee.

All Universities must understand that the legislature has made available to

every staff member of an institute of higher education a right of appeal to the

USAB in order to air their grievances and rectify any error committed by such

University in respect of any matters set out in Section 86 of the Universities

Act. With flopenness" and "transparency" being the watchwords of our times

and to make this process more meaningful, it is essential that all documents

relied upon in making the impugned decision are placed before the USAB by

the University. This would include making available the mark sheets and

reports of the examiners, in particular where allegations are made that the

examiners have been biased towards the applicant, or that the marks have

been tampered with, as in this case. A failure to do so would deprive the USAB

of making a detailed inquiry into the grievance of the applicant and would

render the remedy provided by the Universities Act, meaningless.

It would be appropriate to consider at this stage, the several irregularities that

the Petitioner is complaining of. These irregularities fit into the following three

stages of the Petitioner's application, the first being the role of the 'Screening

Committee' appointed by the 1st Respondent; the second is the manner in

which the External Experts' reports were considered; and the final stage being

14

the manner in which the Selection Committee altered the marks given to the

Petitioner by the Panel and the External Experts. This Court would consider

whether the alleged irregularities committed by the 1st Respondent during

each of these stages were illegal, irrational or procedurally improper and if so,

whether the decision of the USAB to dismiss the appeal of the Petitioner

without taking into consideration such irregularities can stand.

The first complaint of the Petitioner relates to the role played by a committee

appointed by the 1st Respondent, known as the 'Screening Committee'. The

Petitioner states that Circular No. 723 stipulates very clearly the manner in

which the evaluation of an application is to be carried out, which has been

outlined earlier in this judgment. The appointment of a Screening Committee

however is not contemplated by Circular No. 723 and such a committee is

therefore outside the approved scheme of promotion.

The Petitioner claims that contrary to the said scheme set out in Circular No.

723, the 1st Respondent University had established the 'Screening Committee'

to examine each application and to "advise" the candidate on the correct

allocation of marks. In fact, the 1st Respondent, in its Statement of Objections

has explained the reasons for the setting up of the Screening Committee in the

following manner:

"According to the experts who evaluated the self assessments of

candidates, 'the applicants self assessments were not in accordance with

the marking scheme and that they had failed to identify the appropriate

section in terms of which their contributions could be assessed and that

the candidates had also claimed marks over and above the limits

15

permitted by the marking scheme thereby hindering the due completion

of the process of recruitment;

That having considered the circumstances, the Council at its meeting held

on Oih January 2004 recommended the appointment of a (screening

committee' to go through the self assessment of candidates and to advise

the candidates to upgrade his/her self assessment in accordance with the

relevant marking scheme."

Thus, by the Respondents own admission, the purpose of establishing the

Screening Committee was to assist the candidates on how they should mark

themselves. Even though the appointment of the Screening Committee is

outside the scheme set out in Circular No. 723, on the face of it, this Court

does not see any prejudice being caused to an applicant if what was stated

above, was its only purpose. However, as demonstrated by the Petitioner and

admitted by the 1st Respondent, unfortunately this was not the case.

The Petitioner states that his application had been subjected to screening by

Professor R. Sivachandran, Associate Professor in Geography and the late

Professor S. Krishnarajah, Professor in Philosophy, both of whom the Petitioner

claims does not have the competency to decide on the Petitioner's application

as their expertise do not lie in the area of expertise of the Petitioner. As

referred to earlier, the Petitioner had applied for the post of Professor /

Associate Professor in Economic Statistics. It does not take much to realise that

a Professor in Geography and a Professor in Philosophy are certainly not the

most competent persons to evaluate an application of a candidate who is

seeking to become a Professor of Economic Statistics.

16

This Court is at a loss to understand how a Screening Committee consisting of

the said Professors, however knowledgeable they may be in their areas of

expertise, could have advised the Petitioner on the manner in which he should

prepare his self-assessment. The Petitioner, by a letter dated 16th June 2009,

annexed to the petition marked 'A28b' had refused to accept the observations

made by the Screening Committee with regard to his application on the basis

that they were not eligible to study his application. This Court also observes

that the Petitioner had in fact pointed out in 'A28b' that it was the duty of the

External Experts to decide on the relevance of the contributions made by him,

a point which was later echoed by the University Grants Commission by its

letter marked 'RR28'.

The gravity of the complaint of the Petitioner that the appointment of a

Screening Committee outside the scheme of evaluation set out in Circular No.

723 is illegal can only be understood when one considers the fact that the

observations of the Screening Committee had been made available to the

External Experts, completely undermining the independence expected from

the said External Experts. The 1st Respondent has in fact admitted that the

observations of the Screening Committee were sent to the External Experts7

This Court is of the view that while the appointment of the Screening

Committee was in itself contrary to the procedure contemplated by Circular

No. 723, this course of action goes a step further by being completely contrary

even to the stated intention of appointing a Screening Committee, which was

to advise the applicants on how to upgrade his or her self assessment. The

Petitioner claims that the External Experts relied on the observations of the

7 Paragraph 16(viii) of the Statement of Objections.

17

Screening Committee when evaluating his application and that the External

Experts were prejudiced by the observations of the Screening Committee. The

fact that at least one of the External Experts relied on the findings and

observations of the screening committee is in fact borne out by the marking

sheet produced by the Respondents marked 'RR34a'.

This Court must observe that in March 2007, the 1st Respondent sought the

views of the University Grants Commission on the legality of the Screening

Committee.s The University Grants Commission, by its letter dated 6th

November 2007, produced by the Respondents marked 'RR28' had directed

the 1st Respondent that "applications submitted to the posts of Associate

Professor / Professor for appointment / promotion on merit should not be

referred to a Screening Committee as it is the duty of the Selection Committee

to scrutinize the experts report and other necessary documents related to the

above appointment / promotion and make recommendations accordingly."

It does not appear that the 1st Respondent made any attempt to inform the

External Experts of the above decision of the University Grants Commission,

although it could have done so, as by then, the report of one of the External

Experts had not been received by the 1st Respondent. This Court is of the view

that making available the findings of the Screening Committee to the External

Experts and the failure to withdraw the said findings upon receipt of the UGC's

letter 'RR28' was detrimental to the interests of the Petitioner and eventually

prejudiced the application of the Petitioner.

8 This letter has been marked 'R4-1' before the USAB.

18

Taking into consideration the totality of the Petitioner's complaints with regard

to the Screening Committee, this Court is in agreement with the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent acted outside

the scheme of promotion set out in Circular No. 723 when it subjected the

Petitioner's application for assessment by the Screening Committee. Such

action is both illegal and procedurally improper as the appointment and

function of the said Screening Committee was not contemplated by Circular

723.

The above matters have been raised before the USAB by the Petitioner. This

Court has examined the Order of the USAB, annexed to the petition marked 'G'

and observes that the USAB has not dealt with these issues raised by the

Petitioner with regard to the Screening Committee.

The second stage of the Petitioner's complaints is with regard to the manner in

which the 1st Respondent dealt with the reports of the External Experts.

The Senate of the 1st Respondent had appointed Emeritus Professor T.

Jogaratnam and Professor A. Nanthakumar as the External Experts to evaluate

Sections 2 and 3.1 of the application of the Petitioner. The Petitioner states

that Professor Nanthakumar was an expert in Mathematics and was not

familiar in Economic Statistics, which is the discipline for which the Petitioner

had submitted his application. This Court observes that even though the

Respondents have denied this position, this Court has not been provided with

the qualifications of Professor Nanthakumar. However, the covering letter to

the mark sheet submitted by Professor Nanthakumar confirms that he was a

Professor of Mathematics and Statistics, which is indicative that he was

19

competent to evaluate the application of the Petitioner. This Court is however

not in a position to make a determination whether Professor Nanthakumar

possessed the expertise to evaluate the application of the Petitioner, except to

state that it was imperative that each External Expert possessed the requisite

expertise.

Be that as it may, the Respondents have submitted the detailed mark sheet of

Professor Jogaratnam marked 'RR34A,9 and the detailed mark sheet of

Professor Nanthakumar marked 'RR34B',lO according to which the Petitioner

had obtained the following marks for Sections 2.1 and 3:

Professor Professor Average Average Marks sufficient

Jogaratnam Nanthakumar for Professor/Associate

Professor

Section 71.5 37.6 54.55 Professor (45)

2

Section 20 13.9 16.95 Professor (15)

3.1

Circular No. 723 does not specify that each External Expert must give the

minimum mark stipulated in the Circular for Sections 2 and 3.1 nor does it

specify the manner in which the final mark for Sections 2 and 3.1 should be

arrived at. Therefore, in deciding the final mark for the said sections, it would

be reasonable to take the average marks of the two External Experts. If that

was done, the Petitioner would have qualified under Sections 2 and 3.1 for

appointment as Professor, as demonstrated by the above table. However, no

9 The Covering letter is dated 25th January 2007.

10 The covering letter is dated 25th February 2008.

20

explanation has been offered by the Respondents as to why the average marks

of the two External Experts were not considered by the 1st Respondent.

Instead of taking the average mark, the course of action adopted by the 1st

Respondent in order to determine the eligibility of the Petitioner in respect of

Sections 2 and 3.1 was to appoint a third External Expert to evaluate the said

sections. The Petitioner has two sub complaints with regard to the

appointment of a third External Expert. The first is that such a course of action

is not provided for in Circular No. 723 which is the Circular in terms of which

the Petitioner's application had to be marked. The second is that the third

expert so appointed did not have a knowledge of Tamil and therefore was not

competent to evaluate the Petitioner's application.

This Court has examined Circular No. 723 and observes that it does not provide

for the appointment of a third External Expert, for whatever reason. This Court

is therefore in agreement with the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner that the adoption of such a course of action by the 1st Respondent is

clearly outside the procedure laid down in Circular No. 723 and is illegal.

This Court observes that the procedure adopted by the 1st Respondent in

appointing a third External Expert has a nexus with the procedure set out in

Circular No. 869,11 which replaced Circular No. 723, and which was in operation

by the time the Petitioner's application was evaluated. Although Circular No.

869 is not applicable, the action of the 1st Respondent in appointing the third

External expert can be justified under the procedure set out in Circular No.

869.

11 Circular No. 869 was effective from 1st December 2005 and a copy thereof has been annexed to the petition marked 'A48a'.

21

The relevant sections of Circular No. 869 are re-produced below:

liThe Senate shall appoint two experts in the relevant field from outside

the higher educational institution concerned to evaluate the applicant's

contribution to Research and Creative Work (Sections 2 and 3.1 of the

marking scheme).

Where one of the two outside subject experts gives marks above the

minimum threshold to a candidate and the other does not .... , the

Registrar or other person from the Establishments Division processing

applications shall arrange for a discussion (in person or electronic)

between the two subject experts with a view to reaching a consensus.

Failing a consensus being arrived at, a third subject expert shall be

appointed by the Senate."

A condition precedent for the appointment of a third External Expert is that

the University must arrange for a discussion between the two External Experts

in order to ascertain if a consensus can be arrived at between the two External

Experts. If there is consensus, it would obviate the necessity for the

appointment of a third expert. The Respondents have not submitted to this

Court any material to establish that this discussion in fact took place between

the two External Experts nor have they referred to any discussion in the

Statement of Objections.

While reiterating that a reference to a third External Expert was outside

Circular No. 723, if resort was to be had to the procedure laid down in Circular

22

No. 869, then the 1st Respondent ought to have complied in full with the

conditions and the procedure set out in Circular No. 869. However, it is clear to

this Court that not only has the 1st Respondent adopted a procedure of its own

by having direct resort to a third External expert, outside of Circular No. 723

and even Circular No. 869, but also failed to explain as to why it adopted a

course of action unknown to the procedure laid down in the said Circulars.

The next complaint of the Petitioner is that an evaluation of Section 3.1

requires a knowledge of the Tamil language as it involves an examination of

the text books written by the Petitioner in Tamil. This Court has examined

Section 3.1 and notes that under this section, marks are given for the following

categories:

(13.1 Dissemination of knowledge

3.1.1. Textbooks for University students published by a recognized

publisher

3.1.2 Scientific and literary communications (feature articles in

newsletters, newspapers, scientific magazines etc)

3.1.3 Published Orations and Presidential addresses at National,

Academic and Professional bodies

3.1.4 Commissioned report for national/international bodies."

The Petitioner states that the third External Expert, Professor R.O Thattil,

Professor of Statistics (Biometry), Department of Crop Science, Faculty of

Agriculture, does not have a knowledge of Tamil, and that Professor Thattil

was therefore not competent to evaluate his application. This Court observes

23

that the Petitioner, by a letter dated 15th September 2009 annexed to the

petition marked (A39' informed the 2nd Respondent, the Vice Chancellor of the

1st Respondent University that the text books referred to in Section 3.1.1 and

the research articles referred in Section 2.3 are written in Tamil. This fact too

has not been denied by the 1st Respondent, thus giving rise to the issue

whether the review by the third External Expert was in fact effective.

This Court observes that the third External Expert has given the Petitioner the

following marks:

Section Mark

Section 2 67.75

Section 3.1 11

The above complaint of the Petitioner, which relates to Section 3.1 as well,

appears to have some merit when one considers the fact that the Petitioner

received only 11 marks for the said Section, which is below the threshold

specified in Circular No. 723 for appointment as Professor.

Be that as it may, having gone through a third External Expert, what should the

1st Respondent have done with these marks? Should it act only upon the marks

of the third External Expert? Or should it take the average of the marks given

by the two External Experts and then combine with the marks of the third

External Expert and thereafter take the average of these two marks as the final

mark? Or should the 1st Respondent have taken the aggregate of the marks of

all three External Experts and then taken an average, in order to decide the

final mark? Or should the 1st Respondent disregard the lowest of the three

24

marks and take the average of the two highest marks? While no explanation

has been offered by the 1st Respondent, as would be seen later, the procedure

that was eventually adopted by the 1st Respondent was completely unknown

to Circular No. 723, and even to Circular No. 869.

As the 1st Respondent has partially adopted the procedure laid down in Circular

No. 869 by appointing a third External Expert, this Court will now examine the

procedure laid down in Circular No. 869 with regard to the manner in which

the marks allocated by the said third External Expert should be dealt with, even

though a reference to a third External expert has not been provided for in

Circular No. 723 ..

The relevant section of Circular No. 869 is re-produced below:

"Whether a candidate is above or below the threshold shall be decided by

whether the third subject expert gave marks above or below the

threshold .....

The final marks of a candidate shall be the averages of the total and

component marks given by the two subject experts (and panel)12 or,

where a third subject expert had to be appointed, of the third subject

expert and, that subject expert of the first two subject experts who

assigned the highest total marks to the candidate, and the panel.13

This Court would like to consider what the position would have been, had the

1st Respondent, having appointed the third External Expert, had followed the

rest of the procedure in Circular No. 869, by examining a table prepared by the

Petitioner which is annexed to the Counter Affidavit marked as 'CAll',

showing the marks given by the three External Experts and the average

obtained. An extract thereof is re-produced below:

Section Section Are the marks

2 3.1 sufficient for

Professor

First Expert 71.5 20 Yes

Second Expert 37.6 13.9 No

Average of First and Second expert 54.55 16.95 Yes

Third Expert 67.75 11 Only for Section 2

Average of all three 58.95 14.97 Yes (by adding 0.5

given for Section

3.2)

Average of the two highest 69.62 15.5 Yes

Marks of Third Expert combined 61.15 13.975 Only for Section 2

with the average of First and

second experts

If the Respondents had followed the provisions of Circular No. 869 and

adopted the average of the two highest marks, the Petitioner would have been

entitled to be appointed as a Professor, provided he had obtained sufficient

marks for Section 1.

Taking into consideration the totality of the above circumstances, this Court is

in agreement with the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the

1st Respondent has acted completely outside the procedure laid down in

Circular No. 723 when considering the marks given by the two External Experts

for Sections 2 and 3.1. The procedure adopted by the 1st Respondent does not

26

comply in full with Circular No. 869 either, thereby demonstrating that the 1st

Respondent has adopted a procedure of its own. Such arbitrary action is not

only illegal but is procedurally improper, and cannot be condoned by this

Court.

Once again, this Court observes that the USAB has not gone into the above

complaints of the Petitioner at all, except to state that the appointment of a

third External Expert accrued to the benefit of the Petitioner.

The final complaint of the Petitioner relates to the procedure followed by the

Selection Committee, which has been tasked with the responsibility of the final

selection.

The Petitioner has produced with his Counter Affidavit marked 'CA8', the mark

sheet of the Selection Committee and the summary of the marks given by the

Selection Committee marked 'CA8(A)'. This Court has examined 'CA8' and

observes that the Selection Committee had carried out its own marking of

Sections 2 and 3.1 and allocated its own marks to the Petitioner.

According to 'CA8(A)', the summary of the marks allotted by the Selection

Committee is as follows:

Minimum Expert Expert Expert Evaluation Selection

marks 1 2 3 Panel Committee

Section 20/20 20.5 20.5

1

Section 45/25 71.5 37.5 67.75 52.8

2

27

Section 15/10 20 13.9 11 11.5 3.1

Section 0.5 0.5

3.2

90/65 85.3

The Selection Committee has thus given the Petitioner 52.8 marks for Section 2

and a further 11.5 marks for Section 3.1. When one considers this mark with

the earlier table, it is clear that this mark does not tally with any of the four

scenarios given therein and that the Selection Committee has reduced the

marks given by at least two of the External Experts. The Petitioner has

submitted to this Court a table marked 'CA12' which sets out the manner in

which the Selection Committee has reduced the marks given by the External

Experts. The 1st Respondent has however not explained the basis on which the

Selection Committee arrived at the above mark for Sections 2 and 3.1.

The Petitioner's complaint is that the Selection Committee does not have the

power to adjust or alter the marks given by the External Experts or the Panel.

What then is the role of the Selection Committee? Circular No. 723 sets out

that the 'final selection shall be made by the Selection Committee based on

the evaluation reports and in conformity with the procedure of appointment'.

This Court is of the view that the Selection Committee cannot merely rubber

stamp the marks given by the External Experts and the Panel and that the

Selection Committee must have the power to examine the marks given by each

of the experts and the panel, and where necessary make adjustments.

However, this Court is mindful that granting the Selection Committee the

power to make any adjustment it wishes would render nugatory the object

that is sought to be achieved by having experts to review an application for

28

Professor. Either way, this Court is of the view that Circular No. 723 does not

contemplate a complete re-assessment of Sections 2 and 3.1, as in the instant

case.

Therefore, it is imperative that the right balance is struck between the two.

This Court is of the view that where there are any inconsistencies which are of

a non-academic nature, or any glaring errors in the marks given by the experts

or the panel, the Selection Committee has the power to rectify such errors or

inconsistencies. However, where any adjustments are carried out, this Court is

of the view that the Selection Committee must set out the reasons for such

adjustment and if required, provide to Court the basis on which the marks

given by the experts was adjusted. Furthermore, where the Selection

Committee is of the view that adjustments need to be made in respect of

marks given on academic issues, it is prudent that the Selection Committee

consults the External Experts and arrive at a consensus which addresses the

concerns of the Selection Committee. In this instance, the 1st Respondent has

neither given any reasons nor justified the downward adjustment of the marks

allocated to the Petitioner.

It also appears from 'R4_1'14 that the adjustment of marks by the Selection

Committee is contrary to the procedure that the 1st Respondent claims the

Selection Committee would normally follow. What is even more disturbing is

the fact that the mark sheet 'CAS' and the summary 'CASCA)' has alterations on

it, with the Petitioner alleging that the Selection Committee had entered the

final mark after erasing an earlier mark.

14 'R4-1' is a letter dated 21st March 2007, sent to the Chairman of the UGC, produced by the 1st Respondent before the USAB.

29

In the above circumstances it is clear to this Court that the Selection

Committee has deviated from the procedure contained in Circular 723. As

pointed out at the commencement of this judgment, the USAB did not have

the benefit of the mark sheet 'CAS' or the summary 'CAS A' as they were not

produced before it by the 1st Respondent, and presumably for that reason, the

Order of the USAB does not deal with this argument of the Petitioner.

. This Court would like to refer to at this stage the abovementioned judgment of

the Supreme Court in Dr. Karunananda vs The Open University of Sri Lanka

and others15

, t he facts of which very briefly are as follows. The petitioner

complained against the decision of the Selection Committee to refuse his

application for the post of Assistant Professor/ Professor. The petitioner did

not challenge the correctness of the assessment by the External Experts and

the panel, but rather the procedure followed in the evaluation process of his

application. On the basis of the criteria in Circular 723, the Senate had

appointed a panel and two External Experts to evaluate the application. The

Selection Committee had not recommended the petitioner for either of the

said posts on the basis that the panel had not given him adequate marks for

'Research and Creative work'. Pursuant to an appeal by the petitioner, a

second panel and third External expert had been appointed16 but owing to a

high degree of variance in the marks even after the appointment of the third

expert and a refusal by the third expert to review the marks given by him, the

Selection Committee acting solely on the original marks awarded to the

petitioner by the first panel and the first two External Experts, rejected the

15 Supra.

16 The rationale for the appointment of a third expert is stated as follows: "One of the experts appointed for evaluation had given 34 points and the other had given 9.8 points. To qualify for promotion he should obtain 25 points under this category ................ Since there is a high variance ................ recommended to obtain an evaluation report from a third expert."- at page 242.

30

application of the petitioner on the basis that he had not obtained the

necessary marks as per Circular 723.

Commenting on the above procedure adopted by the Selection Committee,

the Supreme Court observed as follows:

({A series of questions arise at this juncture. Whether the procedure

adopted by the 1st respondent University is fair, reasonable and

justifiable? What was the purpose of appointing a third External Expert

when there was a high degree of variance of assessment between the 1st

and the 2nd External Experts, if the marks were to be ignored thereafter?

Wasn't it fair and reasonable to have considered the average of the two

positive marks, if the third External Expert had awarded more than the

minimum marks? Couldn't the Selection Committee have considered the

average of the three sets of marks available to them? In such

circumstances, couldn't the Selection Committee have considered

recommending the petitioner to be promoted to the Grade of Associate

Professor of the 1st respondent University?"17

The Supreme Court, having held that the fundamental rights of the petitioner

enshrined in Article 12(1) had been infringed as a result of the irregular

procedure followed, directed the University to re-assess the application of the

petitioner.

The concerns of this Court in this application are far greater, given the several

complaints of the Petitioner with regard to the arbitrary manner in which the

17 Ibid. at page 242.

31

1 st Respondent acted when evaluating the application of the Petitioner. The

Petitioner has in fact submitted that he had a legitimate expectation that the

Respondents would carry out the evaluation of his application according to the

procedure laid down in Circular No. 723 and that the Petitioner's application

would not be subject to any other procedure not stipulated in the said circular.

The importance of complying with due procedure has been succinctly stated in

Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth18 in the following manner:

"Procedure is not a matter of secondary importance. As governmental

powers continually grow more drastic, it is only by procedural fairness

that they are rendered tolerable. A judge of the United States Supreme

Court has said: 'Procedural fairness and regularity are of the

indispensable essence of liberty. Severe substantive laws can be

endured if they are fairly and impartially applied,19. One of his colleagues

said: 'The history of liberty has largely been the history of the

observance of procedural safeguards."20

The following passage by Bhagwati J, in the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.

The International Airport Authority of India and Others21 is relevant in this

regard, although the facts of that case have no application to the present case:

lilt is a well settled rule of administrative law that an executive authority

must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its actions

18 Supra; page 373. This passage has been referred to by the Supreme Court in Dr Karunananda vs The Open University of Sri Lanka and others (supra, page 243). 19Shaughnessy v. United States, 345 US 206 (1953) Jackson, J. 20McNabb v. United States, 318 US 332 (1943) Frankfurter, J.

21 AIR 1979, S.c. 1628.

32

to be judged and it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain of

invalidation of an act in violation of them. This rule was enunciated by Mr.

Justice Frankfurter in Vitarelli v. Seaton22 where the learned Judge said .....

liThe defined procedure must be scrupulously observed .... This judicially

evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may

add, rightly so. He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the

sword."23

... this rule, though supportable also as emanating from Article 14, does

not rest merely on that article. It has an independent existence apart from

Article 14. It is a rule of administrative law which has been judicially

evolved as a check against exercise of arbitrary power by the executive

authority.24

... It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed by the rule of law

the executive Government or any of its officers should possess arbitrary

power over the interests of the individual. Every action of the executive

Government must be informed with reason and should be free from

arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law and its bare

minimal requirement."2s

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the failure on the

part of the USAB to consider the grounds urged by the Petitioner amounts to

an error on the face of the record and that the said decision is liable to be

quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

33

This Court would like to briefly consider the application of the Petitioner for a

Writ of Mandamus to backdate his promotion to the post of Senior Lecturer

Grade II from 1st December 1997 to 1st December 1995. The Petitioner, who

had been appointed as an Assistant Lecturer (Probationary) on 1st January

1990, was required to obtain a post-graduate degree in order to become

eligible for confirmation and the subsequent appointment to Senior Lecturer

Grade II. The Petitioner however took up the position that he need not obtain

a further post graduate degree as he already possessed a post graduate degree

at the time he applied for the post of Assistant Lecturer in 1989. The 1st

Respondent's position was that the said degree had been taken into

consideration at the time he was appointed in 1990. During this time, the

Petitioner had been placed under interdiction and had been reinstated only on

1st December 1997. The Petitioner was promoted as a Senior Lecturer Grade II

with effect from the said date by virtue of the provisions of Circular No. 721.

This Court observes that the Petitioner had accepted this appointment without

any protest and had sought to ante date the appointment only in 2002. This

Court is of the view that the Petitioner, having acquiesced with the date of

appointment, is estopped from challenging it many years later. In any event,

this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the aforementioned relief nor

the backdating of the Petitioner's promotion to Senior Lecturer Grade I. The

Writ of Mandamus is a discretionary remedy and this Court is of the view that

its discretion ought not to be exercised with regard to the said relief, in view of

the aforementioned acquiescence, inordinate delay on the part of the

Petitioner in challenging the date of appointment and in view of the

administrative inconvenience that can be caused.

34

...

Before concluding, this Court would like to advert to the several objections

raised by the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the

Respondents. The first objection raised is that the Petitioner is guilty of laches,

as he is seeking to challenge the decision of the 1st Respondent made in 2010,

only in 2013 and that the Petitioner has failed to explain the reasons for the

delay in seeking relief from this Court. This Court observes that this application

arises from the decision of the USAB which was delivered on 12th March 2013.

This application has been filed on 1st June 2013, which is a period of less than

three months from the date of the USAB order. This Court therefore holds that

the application has been filed within a reasonable time. In any event, this Court

has consistently held that where there is an illegality, the Court should exercise

its discretion in favour of the Petitioner, even where there is a delay. This

position is supported by the judgment of the Supreme Court in Biso Menika v.

Cyril de Alwis and others.

26

The second objection of the learned Additional Solicitor General is that the

Petitioner has failed to disclose the breach of statutory duty necessary for

granting of a Writ of Mandamus and that a Writ of Mandamus does not lie

where the Respondents are meant to exercise discretion. Whilst agreeing with

the authorities cited by the Respondents which support the contention that a

Writ of Mandamus does not lie to compel the performance of a moral

obligation, this Court is of the view that in the present application, there has in

fact been a breach of statutory duty by the Respondents to carry out their

functions within the boundaries of the law. There is no such thing as

unfettered discretion in administrative law27, This Court is therefore of the

261982 (1) Sri LR 368 at 379-380.

27 Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth (supra); page 295: "Statutory power conferred for public purposes is conferred as is were upon trust, not absolutely - that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and

35

view that the Respondents were under a statutory duty to exercise their

discretion reasonably, in good faith and upon lawful and relevant grounds of

public interest.

In this regard, this Court would like to cite the following passage from the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Heather Mundy vs Central Environmental

Authority and Others28 where it was held as follows:

liThe jurisdiction conferred by Article 140, however is not confined to

"prerogative" writs or "extraordinary remedies" but extends -"subject to

the provisions of the Constitution"- to orders in the nature of writs of

certiorari, etc. Taken in the context of our Constitutional principles and

provisions, these "Orders" constitute one of the principal safeguards

against excess and abuse of executive power; mandating the judiciary to

defend the sovereignty of the People enshrined in Article 3 against

infringement or encroachment by the Executive, with no trace of any

deference due to the crown and its agents. Further this court itself has

long recognized and applied the "public trust" doctrine; that powers

vested in public authority are not absolute or unfettered but are held in

trust for the public, to be exercised for the purposes for which they have

been conferred, and that their exercise is subject to judicial review by

reference to those purposes.,,29

proper way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have intended. Although the Crown's lawyers have argued in numerous cases that unrestricted permissive language confers unfettered discretion, the truth is that, in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered governmental discretion is a contradiction in terms. The real question is whether the discretion is wide or narrow, and where the legal line is to be drawn. For this purpose everything depends upon the true intent and meaning of the empowering Act." 28SC 58/03; SC Minutes 20th January 2004. 29Referred to in Kunanantham v University of Jaffna (2005) 1 SLR 239.

36

An issue similar to this case arose in W.K.C.Perera vs Professor Oaya

Edirisinghe and others30 where the Institute of Aesthetic Studies of the

University of Kelaniya refused to award the degree to the appellant even

though she had satisfied all requirements of the Examination Criteria for an

ordinary pass and thereby had become entitled to the award of the Degree.

Although it was conceded by the University that the Court should grant a Writ

of Certiorari to quash the decision not to award the Appellant the Degree, it

was contended however, that Court should not grant a Writ of Mandamus to

compel the award of the Degree, but only to require the relevant authorities

to consider the question of awarding that Degree. It was also submitted, firstly,

that there was no public duty to award a Degree, and that no one had a right

to the award of a Degree and secondly, that any institution awarding Degrees

had a residual discretion to withhold a Degree, even if the candidate had

satisfied the relevant regulations.

The Supreme Court rejected the said argument and held as follows:

"I hold that, having satisfied the Rules and Examination Criteria, the

petitioner was entitled to the award of the Degree of Bachelor of Fine

Arts on the results of the final examination held in 1990. The University of

Kelaniya and the Institute are public bodies set up by statute and

performing public functions, using public funds. I hold that under the

Rules and Examination Criteria, read with Article 12, there was a public

30 1995 (1) Sri LR 148; judgment of Justice Mark Fernando.

37

duty, cast upon its officers, enforceable by Mandamus, to take the

necessary steps to award the Appellant that Degree.

The Appellant is entitled to an order in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to

quash the refusal by the University of Kelaniya and/or the Institute of

Aesthetic Studies and/or its officers to award her the Degree of Bachelor

of Fine Arts, and to an order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to take all necessary steps,

within the scope of their powers, duties and functions, to award her that

Degree."

Thus, it is within the jurisdiction of this Court to grant a Writ of Mandamus

where the Petitioner has satisfied the criteria set out in Circular No. 723.

The third and final objection of the learned Additional Solicitor General is that

the Petitioner has acquiesced to the jurisdiction of the USAB when he

participated in the proceedings before the USAB and is therefore stopped from

challenging the findings of the USAB. This Court is of the view that the

Petitioner is not challenging the jurisdiction of the USAB, but rather the fact

that the USAB failed to consider the matters placed before it when arriving at

its decision.

The final question that must be addressed by this Court is the relief that this

Court can grant the Petitioner. When there is such a glaring violation of the

procedure laid down, this Court would have preferred to have send this matter

back to the 1st Respondent for a fresh appraisal and evaluation or to the USAB

for a fresh consideration of the matters raised by the Petitioner. However,

38

such a course of action is not feasible in this instance and would be to the

detriment of the Petitioner, for two reasons.

The first is the allegation of the Petitioner that there has been an undue delay

on the part of the 1st Respondent in evaluating the Petitioner's application.

This Court observes that the application submitted by the Petitioner on 29th

November 2005 culminated in a decision by the Selection Committee only on

12th March 2010. This is indeed a long period of time to evaluate an

application, when one considers the allegation levelled by the Petitioner that

applications of other candidates were processed within 1 Y2 to 2 years.

The second reason is that a period of 13 Y2 years have lapsed since the

Petitioner first applied for the post of Professor, inclusive of almost three years

before the USAB and therefore, the ends of justice will not be met by referring

this matter for a re-evaluation by the 1st Respondent or a re-consideration by

the USAB.

This Court does not intend to venture into the arena of academic judgment by

taking on the role of academic experts and awarding marks to the Petitioner.

What this Court would endeavour to do instead is to determine the marks that

the Petitioner was entitled to, if not for the procedural improprieties

committed by the 1st Respondent, by applying the provisions of Circular No.

723. The result, as demonstrated by the table below is that the Petitioner was

eligible to be appointed as a Professor and not Associate Professor.

The Petitioner, having submitted an a pplication, was entitled to be appointed

as a Professor provided he received the minimum marks for each section and

the minjmum overall marks. Granting the appointment was not at the

discretion of the 1st Respondent. Having received the required marks, it is the

view of this Court that the Petitioner had a legal right to be appointed as

Professor and the Respondents were under a legal duty to grant the said

appointment. It is therefore reiterated that it is within the jurisdiction of this

Court to grant a Writ of Mandamus where the Petitioner has satisfied the

criteria set out in Circular No. 723.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

order of the USAB not to promote the Petitioner to the post of Professor, and a

Writ of Mandamus on the Respondents to promote the Petitioner to the post

of Professor with effect from 29

th November 2005.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
