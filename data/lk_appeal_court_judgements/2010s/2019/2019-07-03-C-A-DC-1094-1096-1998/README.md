Decided on: 03.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this partition action naming 4 defendants

seeking to partition the land described in paragraph 2 of the

plaint among the plaintiff and the four defendants. By the time

the case was to be taken up for trial, there had been 15

defendants, and all but 14 have raised issues.1 At the trial,

several parties have given evidence seeking to vindicate their

undivided rights to the land, but the District Judge in the

Judgment dated 24.08.1998 has given undivided shares only to

the plaintiff and the 1st and 5th defendants, and left 338/720

shares unallotted. Being dissatisfied with this Judgment, the

2nd defendant, the 5th defendant, and 6th, 11th, 13A defendants

have preferred these appeals.

The peculiar reason given by the District Judge not to have given

any soil rights to any party other than the plaintiff and the 1st

and 5th defendants is that, although the other parties have

produced deeds at the trial, they have no possession in the land.

According to the District Judge, for a party to have a partition

title to the land, he or she must have possessed the land!2 This

finding, to say the least, is absurd.

It is a very basic principle even law students should know that

possession of one co-owner is possession of the other co-owners.

It is also equally elementary that there is no law that the owner

of a land must possess the land, and if he does not possess, he

loses his title. He can possess only if he wants. Right to

possession is an incident of ownership, but not an indispensable

requirement to keep the ownership intact, although the owner

may lose title on proof of prescriptive title by another.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court in toto. There is

no necessity to order retrial as some of the appellants have

sought. The incumbent District Judge is directed to deliver the

Judgment afresh on the evidence already lead. In order to assist

the Judge, the counsel for the parties can be allowed to file

written submissions before the matter is fixed for the Judgment.

Appeals allowed. No costs.
