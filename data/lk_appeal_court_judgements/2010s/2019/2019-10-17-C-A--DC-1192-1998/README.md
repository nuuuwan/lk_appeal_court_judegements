This is an appeal against the Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dated

08.05.1998.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Galle

seeking inter alia a declaration of title to the allotments of land (Lots lA, 1B and 2) containing in

extent A.0-R.3-P.6 morefully described in paragraph 2 ofthe plaint dated 14.08.1985 [Page 41 of

the Appeal Brief]. The Plaintiff averred in his plaint that-

1. Paragoda Raja Maha Viharaya (Viharaya) is a temple exempted from the operation of

Section 4(1) ofthe Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance;

2. The Plaintiff is the Controlling Viharadhipathi of the said Viharaya;

3. The said allotments of land, which form the subject matter of the action, are temporalities

belonging to the said Viharaya;

4. The late husband of the Defendant-Appellant (Defendant) and Ven. Deegoda Pagnasekera

Thero, the then Controlling Viharadhipathi of the said Viharaya entered into Lease

Agreement No. 1384 dated 17.11.1945 attested by N. U. A. Wijayasiriwardane, Notary

Public (ol.l) for a period of 10 years and as a result, the Defendant and her late husband

came into the possession of the said allotments of land;

Page 2 of 13

5. In terms of '~l.l', the Lessee (the late husband ofthe Defendant) was allowed to construct

a house, a well and a toilet on the western portion of the said allotments of land [Page 46

ofthe Appeal Brief];

6. After the expiration of the said lease, the late husband of the Defendant and Ven.

Deegoda Somaratne Thero, the then Controlling Viharadhipathi of the said Viharaya

entered into the Lease Agreement No. 4104 dated 28.03.1961 attested by A. V. D. A.

Ranaweera, Notary Public ( ~l .2) for a period of 5 years;

7. An action was instituted by the late husband ofthe Defendant in the District Court of Galle

(Case No. 3037/L) seeking a declaration that '~l.2' is null and void. Accordingly, '~l.2' was

declared null and VOid;

8. The Defendant is in unlawful occupation of the said allotments of land causing damages

to the Plaintiff.

The Defendant filed her answer on 03.09.1986 [Page 53 of the Appeal Brief] and took up the

pOSition that-

1. The said allotments of land never belonged to the said Viharaya;

2. '~l .l' and '~l.2' were null and void and therefore, the Defendant is not bound by them;

3. The Plaintiff cannot maintain the action without establishing as to how he became the

Controlling Viharadhipathi ofthe said Viharaya;

4. The Defendant has acquired the prescriptive title to the said allotments of land by being

in the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for over 10 years.

On 24.07.1991, the Defendant amended her Answer and stated that an action has already been

instituted in the District Court of Galle (Case No. 10818/L) regarding the Viharadhipathiship of

Paragoda Raja Maha Viharaya and prayed for the action to be laid by until the final determination

of Case No. 10818/L. However, the application to lay by the action was rejected.

After a lengthy trial, the learned Additional District Judge entered judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff. It was further held that the Defendant is entitled to recover a sum of Rs. 150,000/- as

compensation for the improvements done and that she can remain in possession Uus retentionis)

until the said sum is paid to her. Hence this appeal.

Page 3 of 13

In a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff must prove and establish his title [D. A. Wanigaratne v.

Juwanis Appuhamy et al (65 N.L.R. 167)]. However, where the legal title is in the plaintiff but the

property is in the possession of the Defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant [Siyaneris

v. Jayasinghe Udenis De Silva (52 N.L.R. 289)].

Even though the Defendant has stated in her Answer that both ' ~l .l' and '~l. 2 ' are null and void,

during the cross-examination, she admitted that she and her late husband entered into the

possession of the said allotments of land in 1945 under and by virtue of ' ~l. l ' [Page 238 and Page

241 of the Appeal Brief]. Moreover, it must be noted that '~l .l' was never declared null and void

by a court having competent jurisdiction.

Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance reads-

"No tenant af immovable property, ar persan claiming through such tenant, shall during the

cantinuance of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that the landlord of such tenant had, at the

beginning af the tenancy, a title to such immovable property; and

No person who came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in possession

thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had a title to such possession at the time

when such licence was given."

Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance gives statutory recognition to the well-known doctrine

that during the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant, the tenant is estopped from

denying the landlord's title or from asserting that another person has a better title than the

landlord [Wahab v. Jayah (1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 78].

The learned counsel for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) submitted that

inasmuch the tenancy was for a 10-year period commencing in 1945 there is no prohibition to

the Appellant denying the tenancy now as section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance only prevents

such action during the continuance of the tenancy. I have no hesitation in rejecting this

submission.

Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance prevents any assertion being made even now that during

the said ten year period beginning from 1945 Ven. Deegoda Pagnasekera Thero, the then

Controlling Viharadhipathi ofthe said Viharaya who is a party to Lease Agreement No. 1384 dated

17.11.1945 attested by N. U. A. Wijayasiriwardane, Notary Public ( ~l .l) did not have valid title as

Viharadhipathi to the said land.

Page 4 of 13

A tenant who has been let into possession cannot deny his landlord's title however defective it

may be, so long as he has not openly restored possession by surrender to his landlord [Wahab v.

layah (supra)]. Where a person entered into possession of immovable property by the licence of

the person in possession thereof, it is unnecessary, and indeed irrelevant, for the purposes of an

argument on estoppel, to consider what the licensor's title truly was. The question is what was

the title which the licensee was apparently recognizing, and this depends on the title which the

licensor was apparently claiming [Meeruppe Sumanatissa Terunnanse v. Warakapitiya

Pangnananda Terunnanse (70 N.L.R. 313)].

Hence even if Ven. Deegoda Pagnasekera Thero was not the viharadhipathi according to law,

when the late husband of the Defendant entered into the Lease Agreement No. 1384 dated

17.11.1945 attested by N. U. A. Wijayasiriwardane, Notary Public ( ~t .1) with Ven. Deegoda

Pagnasekera Thero for the land in dispute, neither he nor the Defendant can deny the title of the

said Ven. Deegoda Pagnasekera Thero.

Furthermore, this amounts to an admission that the land in issue belongs to Paragoda Raja Maha

Viharaya. A temple is an institution, sui generis which is capable of receiving and holding property

that has attributes of a corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding property [Kosgoda

Pangnaseela v. Gamage Pavisthinahamy [(1986) 3 C.A.L.R. 48], Ven. Omare Dhammapala Thera

v. Rajapakshage Peiris [(2004) 1 SrLL.R. 1J.

As I observed earlier, the Defendant admitted that she and her late husband entered into the

possession of the said allotments of land under and by virtue of ' ~t .1'. It was never declared null

and void. The Lessee (the late husband of the Defendant) recognized and acknowledged the title

ofthe Viharaya to the said allotments of land by the execution of '~t. 1 '.

Therefore, I hold that in terms of Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance the Defendant is

estopped from denying that the said allotments of land belonged to Paragoda Raja Maha

Viharaya prior to 1945.

Section 34 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance reads-

"In the case of any claim for the recovery of any property, movoble or immovable,

belonging or alleged to belong to any temple, or for the assertion of title to any such

property, the claim shall not be held to be barred or prejudiced by any provision of the

Prescription Ordinance.

Provided that this section shall not affect rights acquired prior to the commencement of

this Ordinance."

Page 5 of 13

In Piyaratana Thera v. Jathiya and Another [[1985) 2 SrLL.R. 418] the Supreme Court held that

where title by prescription to Buddhist temple land had not been acquired prior to 1931, Section

34 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance bars the acquisition of prescriptive title to temple

land.

In any event it is observed that the Defendant has not in the Answer given the starting point for

her or her husband's acquisition of prescriptive rights. Where a party invokes the provisions of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant

to immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and squarely on him to establish a starting

point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights [Chellioh v. Wijenothon et 01 (54 N.L.R. 337)].

Therefore, even if the land in issue is not temple land, the prescriptive claim of the Defendant

must fail for failure to specify the staring point for prescriptive rights.

Furthermore, if a person goes into possession of land as an agent for another, prescription does

not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is holding adversely to his principal

[Siyaneris v. Joyasinghe Udenis De Silvo (52 N.L.R. 289)] .However, neither the evidence given by

the Defendant nor the documents marked by her show 'an overt act' whereby the Defendant or

her late husband started to hold the said allotments of land adversely to the owner (Le. Paragoda

Raja Maha Viharaya).

The decision on this appeal could have been made on the legal principles set out above if there

was no change of circumstances.

However, the learned counsel for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) had another

bow to her string. On 04.05.2018, the Appellant made an application under and in terms of

Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code praying fresh evidence to be admitted. The Appellant

sought to produce the following-

1. The Judgment of the D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007

2. The Judgment of the P. H. C. of Southern Province Case No. SP/HCCA/GA 135/2007(F)

dated 22.10.2013

3. The Judgment of the S. C. Case No. SC/HCCA/LA 493/2013 dated 15.09.2016

The learned Additional District Judge, in D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L, has held that the Plaintiff

is not the lawful Viharadhipathi of Paragoda Raja Maha Viharaya. The said determination was

affirmed by both the Provincial High Court of Southern Province and the Supreme Court.

Based on this evidence the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the said decisions

have retrospective effect and as that the Plaintiff could not have maintained this action as he was

not the Viharadhipathy and as such the action must fail.

Page 6 of 13

The question is whether the Judgment of the D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007 (and

the confirmation thereof) has retrospective effect over the judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Galle dated 08.05.1998 as claimed by the learned counsel for the Appellant.

Retrospective/Prospective Effect of a Judgment

As this issue has been raised before me and in view of the dearth of local decisions on it, I wish

to discuss the retrospective effect of a judgment in detail.

The historical view of the common law, expressed by Blackstone in his Commentaries, is that

judges "discover" the law as it truly is and that overruled precedents were misrepresentations of

the law and were never law. "For if it be found that the former decision is manifestly absurd or

unjust, it is declared, not that such a sentence was bad law, but that it was not law" [Blackstone's

Commentaries, Vol. 14th Ed. Oxford (1771) 69J. This is the basis of the declaratory theory of law.

This theory negates any question of only a prospective application of a judgment as the judges

do not make new law but only declare what the law was always.

It is no longer accepted that judges do not make law. They have a legitimate role to play in the

development of the law. Even though most law reform will and should come through legislation,

there are many instances where judges playa creative role. Bentham J in "Truth versus Ashhurst"

[5 The Works of Jeremy Bentham 235 (1863]) asserted that Judge-made law was "dog-law".

Further he explained the role of judge's law making as follows:

"It is the judges that make the common law. Do you know how they make it? Just as a

man makes laws for his dog. When your dog does anything, you want to break him of, you

wait till he does it, and then beat him for it. This is the way you make laws for your dog:

and this is the way the judges make law for you and me"

This approach raises the issue of the prospective application of a judgment and I wish to consider

it after a survey of the approach adopted by other jurisdictions.

United States

In the US prospective overruling was recognized as far back 1848 in Bingham v. Miller [(1848) 17

Ohio 445J. Until the landmark decision in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson [404 U.S. 97 (1971)J the

Federal and State courts functioned on the premise that it was constitutionally permissible and

often equitable for judgments to be given a prospective operation. Justice Cardozo in Great

Northern Railway. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co. [287 U.S. 358 (1932)J held that the

Constitution neither prohibits nor requires prospective overruling. The US federal courts during

this era was of the opinion that to hold otherwise would lead to an inequitable situation where

Page 7 of 13

transactions that had been concluded relying on a previous state ofthe law would be undermined

by the retroactive application of a new rule recognized in a recent judgment.

However, in 1971 the US Supreme Court in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson (supra) took a different

approach to this question of operation and held that judgments should as a rule apply

retroactively, and that there should be exceptional circumstances for the judgment to be

applied on a purely non-retroactive (prospective) basis.

The test applied by the US Supreme Court to decide whether a judgment should apply

prospectively hinged on the manner in which the following 3 questions would be answered.

1. whether the decision to be applied non-retroactively establishes a new principle of law,

either by overruling clear past precedent or by deciding an issue of first impression; (was

the rule genuinely new?)

2. if, in light the new rule's purpose and effect, retroactive operation would further or retard

its operation (retroactive application was not necessary to further the operation of that

rule) and

3. the extent of the inequity imposed by retroactive application, namely the injustice or

hardship that would be caused by retroactive application.

This test underwent further modification in the 1990s. During this period the US Supreme Court

took the position that whenever a particular issue has been newly decided in a case and applied

to the parties to that litigation, that proposition of law would necessarily have to be applied

retroactively to other pending litigation on the same question, irrespective of whether such

litigation had been initiated prior to the judgment.'

This position was succinctly explained in the case of Harper v. VA. Dep't ofTaxation [509 U.S. 86,

97 (1993)] in the following manner:

"When this Court applies a rule of federol low to the parties before it, that rule is the

controlling interpretation of federal low and must be given full retroactive effect in all

cases still open on direct review2 and as to all events, regardless of whether such events

predate or postdate our announcement of the rule .... "

1 James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 50 1 U.S. 529, 543-44 ( 199 1)

2 In James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 50 1 U.S. 529, 543-44 ( 1991), it was held that transactions which had attained a degree of firm finality either because ofa statute of limitations or the doctrine of res judicata would not be affected by the retroactive application ofa new legal rule.

Page 8 of 13

Thus, the widely accepted legal position regarding this question at federal level is that a new

proposition of law that has been applied to the parties to the litigation must necessarily be

applied retroactively to other pending cases on the same question of law. In other words, it is not

possible to selectively apply the new proposition of law retroactively to just the parties to the

litigation and exempt the application of the rule to other pending cases on th e same question. In

an immigration case decided in 2011, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal3 held that judgments

cannot be made prospective in relation to third party cases on th e same question but at the same

time be applied retroactively to the parties to the litigation. The Court went further and held that

one can still rely on the tests in the Chevron Oil Co. case (supro) and decide to apply the judgment

prospectively vis a vis all parties concerned.4 (i.e. parties to the specific litigation and third parties)

It has often been said that courts in the US will be more inclined to apply a new rule of law on a

purely prospective basis when it comes to the fields of contract and property. This is because

litigants in this area of the law would generally have relied substantially on the previous state of

the law when ordering and implementing their transactions.s Similarly, due to the US legal

system's discomfort with ex-post facto criminality, the courts there have often applied judgments

which criminalize conduct that was previously legal (i.e. judgments that expand criminal liability)

on a prospective basis i.e. to acts and conduct which occur subsequent to th e date of the

decision.6

In sum therefore, the US system has now embraced the position that judgments should as a rule

be applied retroactively to the parties' concerned and pending litigation of third parties on the

same question. Nevertheless, the US courts have left the door ajar for purely prospective

application of judgments, when justice and equity so desire such a st ep.

United Kingdom

Although traditionally the UK courts have been reluctant to adopt a practice of prospective

overruling [Birminghom Corporation v. West Midland Baptist (Trust) Association Inc. (1970) AC

874,898-899, Lounchbury v. Morgans (1973) AC 127, 137, Kleinwort Benson Ltd. v. Lincoln City

Council (1999) 2 AC 349, 379] the ability to do so has been raised from time to time [R. v. National

Insurance Commissioner, Ex p Hudson (1972) AC 944, 1015, 1026, Miliongos v. George Fronk

(Textiles) Ltd. (1976) AC 443, 490, R. v. Grovenor of Brockhill Prison, ex p Evans (No.2) (1999) QB

1043, 1058, Arthur J SHoll & Co. v. Simons (2002) 1 AC 615,710].

in Arthur J SHoll & Co. v. Simons (supra) Lord Hope made the first judicial statement which

endorsed the idea that prospective overruling may be a legitimate court function. He stated as

follows:

"I consider it to be a legitimate exercise of your Lordships' judicial function to dec/are

prospectively whether or not the immunity - which is a judge-made rule - is to be available

in the future and, if so, in what circumstances."

Later, in National Westminster Bank pic v. Spectrum Plus Ltd and Others (in liquidation) [(2005)

UKHL 41], the House of Lords attempted to reconcile these seemingly divergent strands of judicial

opinions. Lord Nicholls writing for the majority acknowledged the principled objections taken to

prospective overruling by the UK system in the past viz. the usurpation of the legislative function

by court when they declared law as only applying to the future and treating decisions taken

before and after the judgment differently. However, Lord Nicholls and the House of Lords were

willing to leave the door ajar for prospective only operation of judgments as long as the following

high threshold was met [para. 40]:

"Instances where this power has been used in courts elsewhere suggest there could be

circumstances in this country where praspective overruling would be necessary to serve

the underlying objective of the courts of this country: to administer justice fairly and in

accordance with the law. There could be cases where a decision on an issue of law,

whether common law or statute law, was unavoidable but the decision would have such

gravely unfair and disruptive consequences for past transactions or happenings that this

House would be compelled to depart from the normal principles relating to the

retrospective and prospective effect of court decisions"(emphasi s added)

Page 10 of 13

Accordingly, a few decisions given subsequently have endorsed the possibility of UK courts giving

judgments that would apply prospectively [Cadder v. Her Majesty's Advocate [2010] UKSC 43,

para 58; Ahmed v. HM Treasury (no 2) [2010] UKSC 5]. However, in all these instances the UK

Courts deemed that there were no sufficiently exceptional reasons to apply the judgments only

on a prospective basis.

Finally, much like the US approach, the UK Courts accept that if it is decided that a judicial decision

applies retroactively, it must apply retroactively to both the parties to the litigation and to

pending disputes of third parties on the same question [A v. The Governor of Arbour Hill

Prison [2006]4IR 88] However retroactive decisions cannot affect decided cases (ibid. page 117).

India

In Golaknath v. State of Punjab [(1967) 2 SCJ 762, (1967) AIR 1643] Chief Justice Subba Rao first

invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling inspired by the approach taken by US judges.

However, he was concerned of its future development and laid down following principles of

guidelines regarding the applicability of prospective overruling:

"As this court for the first time has been called upon to apply the doctrine evolved in a

different country under different circumstances, we would like to move warily in the

beginning. We would lay down the following propositions:

(1) the doctrine of prospective overruling can be invoked only in matters arising under our

Constitution;

(2) it can be applied only by the highest court of the country, i.e., the Supreme Court, as

it has the Constitutional jurisdiction to declare law binding on all the courts in India;

(3) the scope of the retroactive operation of the law declared by the Supreme Court

superseding its 'earlier decisions' is left to its discretion to be moulded in accordance with

the justice of the cause or matter before it."

In India non-retroactive effect can be given not only to cases where an earlier decision is

overruled but also to cases which decides an issue for the first time [India Cement Ltd v. State of

Tamil Nadu (1990) 1 SCC 12].

However, it appears that in India prospective overruling has been made only in constitutional

cases.

Page 11 of 13

Canada

In Re Edward and Edward [(1987) 39 DLR (4th) 654] the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal rejected

the possibility of prospective overruling as it would distort the expectation of the judicial role as

independent, neutral and non-legislative.

Australia

In Ha and another v. State of New South Wales [(1997) 189 CLR 465, 503-504] the High Court of

Australia rejected prospective overruling by determining that prospective overruling is

inconsistent with judicial power on the simple ground that the new regime that would be ushered

in when overruling took effect would alter existing rights and obligations whereas the

adjudication of existing rights and obligations as distinct from creation of rights and obligations

distinguishes the judicial power from non-judicial power.

This comparative examination of the possibility of only a prospective application of a judgment

establishes one main point which is that the question of prospective operation of judgments

arises only when a decision by court on a point of law represents a change from what it was

previously thought to be. This may be by express overruling or a new interpretation to the

relevant statutory provision or the creation of a new legal principle in common law.

The judgments in D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007, P. H. C. of Southern Province

Case No. SP/HCCA/GA 135/2007{F) dated 22.10.2013 and S. C. Case No. SC/HCCA/LA 493/2013

dated 15.09.2016 did not make a change on a point of law. Instead it applied the law to the

evidence led before the trial court and decided the question of Viharadhipathi of Paragoda Raja

Maha Viharaya. The question then is what is its relevance to the issues in this case.

The issue of Viharadhipathy in this case was decided based on the evidence led before the trial

judge. The judgments in D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007, P. H. C. of Southern

Province Case No. SP/HCCA/GA 135/2007{F) dated 22.10.2013 and S. C. Case No. SC/HCCA/LA

493/2013 dated 15.09.2016 were made on the evidence led before the trial judge in that case.

That is not a judgment in rem and therefore not applicable to the issue in this case.

There is no application of the doctrine of res judicata as at a minimum the parties and the cause

of action are different. Previously I have held that issue estoppel is part of our law of evidence in

civil cases [Gunosena v. Yogorathne and Others (CA 471/2000, CAM. 23.09.2019)].

Notwithstanding the issue of Viharadhipathi of Paragoda Raja Maha Viharaya arising for

determination in both cases, the identity of the parties in the two actions are different.

Accordingly, issue estoppel also does not arise.

The Supreme Court has, in Oman Ekanayake and athers v. Ratranhamy [(2012) Part II B.loR. 19]

quoted with approval the decision in W.A. Ratwatte v. A. Bandara and another (70 N.loR. 231)

where the Supreme Court adopted the test enunciated by Denning L.J. in Ladd v. Marshall

[(1954) 3 All E.R. 745] in admitting fresh evidence at the stage of appeal. Three conditions have

to be fulfilled. They are:

(1) It must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable

diligence for use at the trial.

(2) The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence

on the result ofthe case, although it may not be decisive.

(3) The evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed or, in other words, it must be

apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.

Evidence of judgments in D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007, P. H. C. of Southern

Province Case No. SP/HCCA/GA 135/2007(F) dated 22.10.2013 and S. C. Case No. SC/HCCA/LA

493/2013 dated 15.09.2016 was admitted as fresh evidence in appeal on 10.10.2018 by a

different bench on the agreement of parties and as such it was not necessary for the Court to

have considered the above tests.

It must also be observed that the contention of the Defendant was that the Plaintiff, not being

the lawful Viharadhipathi, does not have the locus standi to institute an action to obtain a

declaration of title regarding the said allotments of land and seek the ejectment ofthe Defendant.

Yet, subsequent to the Judgement of the D. C. Galle Case No. 10818/L dated 23.11.2007, the

lawful Viharadhipathi was substituted in the place of the Plaintiff in the present appeal by the

Appellant herself.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle dated 08.05.1998.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
