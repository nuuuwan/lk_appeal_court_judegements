Decided on 27.08.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, I.

ethe Plaintiff by filing his plaint dated 31/ 03/ 1986 asserted that he had Q) purchased the prop~rty/ the subject matter of the action in this case from

one Velaudham Pillai by a deed bearing No. 2773 on 12 /i2/1985. The deed and the

Plan depicting the property were produced at the trial as "PI" and "P2". The

Plaintiff averred that befbre Velaudham Pillai sold the Property to him in 1985,

he had given a mortgage of this property to the Defendant/Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Defendant") by a deed bearing No. 1337

and dated 19th October 19~4 for a sum of Rupees five Thousand (Rs. 5000.00//).

The Plaintiff averred in the plaint that when he purd;lased this property from

Velaudham Pillai on 12th December 1985, there was a,prior mortgage allegedly

" executed by Velaudham Pillai by way of a deed bearing No. 1337 and dated 19th

October 1984. In other words the Plaintiff asserted that he has purchased the

Property subject to that mortgage. The Plaintiff further averred in his plaint that

he made a request of the,Defendant to accept the sum of Rupees Five Thousand

" (Rs. 5000.00r) owed by Velaudham Pillai and annul the Mortgage bond but the

Defendant refused to accede to the request for redemption. It was in those

circumstances that the Plaintiff averred that a cause of action accrued to him to

institute the action against the Defendant seeking the following reliefs.

For a declaration demanding the Defendant to accept Rs. 5000//

and cancel t~1e Deed of Mortgage No. 133~ and dated 19/10/1984;

If the Defendant is refusing to accept the said sum of Rs. 5000// the

Plaintiff is ready to deposit the said sum in the Court and therefore

to cancel the said Deed of Mortgage No.B37 and dated 19/10/1984;

, I,

After the cancellation of the said Deed of Mortgage, to eject the

Defendant and all those holding under him and to obtain peaceful

possession of the premises described in the plaint;

As damages a sum of Rs. 100/ ~ from December 1986 until peaceful

possession of the said premises is given;

For a declaration that the Plaintiff is the sole owner of the premises

described in the schedule to the Plaint;

For damages\and such other further relief as to the Court seems

meet.

A two storied building constitutes the Property which was in possession of the

Defendant. This was the case presented by the Plaintiff before the additional

District Court of Kegalle.

As opposed to above version of the Plaintiff the Defendant took up the defense of

tenancy rights under V e1audham Pillai~ the predecessor in title of the Plaintiff.

, The Defendant averred that he had been in occupation of the building qua a

tenant of Velaudham Pilla; paying him rent and in the premises he was protected

under the Rent Act. The Defendant also made a cross claim from the Plaintiff for

a sum of Rupees Twenty Thousand (Rs. 20, ooo.OOr) as damages occasioned by

the acts of the Plaintiff a~ described in paragraph 08 of the answer. In a nutshell

the Defendant stated in hjs answer the following inter alia;

The Defendant is uqaware of the Plaintiff's ownership;

The Defendant is tbe lawful tenant of Velaudham Pillai;

That there was no Deed of Mortgage that was ever written between the

Defendant and Vehmdham Pillai;

The Plaintiff with the assistance of Velaudham Pillai is in collusion trying

to eject the Defendant unlawfully from the premises in suit;

The Mortgage bonq, No.1337 is a forgery;

j

The Defendant prayed in his answer, inter ilia for a dismissal of the action of the

Plaintiff and also for a cross claim of Rs. 20,000/~ as damages.

In the face of the allegation of the Defendant that the Mortgage Bond bearing No.

1337 and dated 19/10/1984 is a forgery, the question of granting a declaration that

the Defendant must accept Rs. 5000/~ and cancel the need of Mortgage No. 1337

and dated 19/10/1984 would not arise provided that the allegation of fraud made

by the Defendant is established at the trial.

At the trial 13 issues were raised consequent upon the pleadings of the Plaintiff

and the Defendant. In order to understand the oral evidence that transpired at

the trial, it is apposite to itemize the documents that were marked at the trial.

On behalf of the Plaintiff the following documents were marked and produced.

"l Pl~ Deed No. 2773 qated 12/12/1985 attested by A. Mutunayaka, by which

" the Plaintiff obtained title to the Land in dispute;

P 2~ Plan No. 1143 dated 11/11/1985 depicting the land in dispute;

P4~ Deed No. 988-dated 29/07/1982 attested by A.D. Ambadeniya the

Notary Public whicb is a usufructury mortgage between Velaudham Pillai

as the Mortgagor and the Defendant as the Mortgagee, in which there is a

condition as follows; 'in lieu of the interest to the said sum of Rs. 2000/ ~

the Defendant is entitled to occupy the premises in suit and if the sum in

the said Deed No.988 which is Rs. 2000/~ is paid by Velaudham Piliai

within 2 years from writing of this Deed, the Defendant must accept the

i said sum of Rs. 2000/ ~ and hand over possession of the said premises to

, i Velaudham Pillai;

Pe 5~ Deed No. 1252 dated 16/05/1984 and attested by A.D. Ambadeniya

No.988;

'-

Pe 6~ Deed of Lease No.l428 given by Velaudham Pillai to one

Malsinhalage Soma~nri;

Pe 7~ Deed of Lease No. 2772 given by the Plaintiff to Malsinhalage

Pe 8~ Certificate of non~settlement issued by the Secretary of Debt

Concilliation Voard;

Mawatha, Kegalle, maintained at Municipal Council Kegalle.

The mortgage Bond bearing No. 1337 and dated 19th October 1984 was marked

subject to proof. In other words the pivotal document "P3" whose cancellation

the Plaintiff sought in his Plaint was strenuously contested by and its due

execution challenged by the Defendant~ Respondent. The Defendant~

Respondent testified that he never obtained a mortgage from Velaudham Pillai , in respect to the building. In other words he never gave a loan to his landlord

Velaudham PillaL He ne-v'cr paid the consideration of Rs. 5000/ ~ for Velaudham

Pillai to execute the mortgage Bond. Premadasa the Defendant~Respondent

testified that Velaudham Pillai acted in collusion with the Notary Ambadeniya

in the execution of the Mortgage Bond~ an exercise which the Defendant alleged

was a sham or a stratagem to have him evicted from the premises. He cried foul

I of the mortgage as fictitious and asserted that it never existed.

As this Deed was marked subject to proof, the Plaintiff summoned the Notary to

establish the due execution of the Deed. The Notary was subjected to a long

drawn~out cross examination in the course of which the following items of

evidence which remain unassailed as regards the execution of the alleged

mortgage bond emerged.

Mortgage Bond (P3 ~ does not refer to a consideration paid in the presence

of the Notary Public,

Mortgage Bond (P3) that was produced in Court was a document certified

by the Notary Public and NOT a Certified Copy issued by the Land

Registry,

There was no independent evidence that a copy of the purported

instrument was ever given to the Respondent,

Folio extracts sho\\'ing registration of the purported Mortgage Bond were

also not produced.

The last item strengthe:t:ls the assertion that the mortgage bond was not

registered.

The Defendant told the Court that he learnt about the purported Mortgage Bond

for the first time on 2.6.1986 when the Notary Public informed him and asked

him to collect such a docLment. Mter the said incident he made a complaint to 1 the police on 26/07/1986 pertaining to the incident. The Defendant denied having

given a sum of Rs. 5000/, to Velaudham PilIaL The Respondent clearly asserted

that the purported Mortgage Bond was a forged document.

The boundaries as described in the Transfer Deed (PI) in favour of the Plaintiff

are inconsistent with the boundaries described in the purported Mortgage Bond

(P3) in favor of the Defend;ant . . tt These facts and the Plaint~ff-Appellant's reluctance to produce the best possible

evidence render the said instrument (the purported mortgage bond-P3 dated

19/10/1984) suspicious or unworthy of credibility in the overall circumstances of

the case, in light of the fact that the Defendant denied the existence of such an

instrument or that there was a "mortgage" of the premises as claimed by the

Appellant. The learned' Additional District Judge' of Kegalle has rightly i concluded that the purpo~:red instrument is a forgery that cannot be acted upon

by Court. (see; page 165 of the Appeal Brief).

From the foregoing it is my view that the learned Additional District judge came

to the correct finding that the Mortgage Bond bearing NO,1337 dated 19th October

1984 was a fraudulent instrument and I see no reason to disturb that finding.

i:

Having thus disposed of the question whether the mortgage bond (P3) as alleged

by the Plaintiff existed at' all in the first place, I woul~ perforce conclude that

there was no mortgage bond in esse that could be annulled or redeemed.

I would now turn to another interesting argument advanced by both Dr Coorey

and Ms. Sudarshani Coorey. This argument, if it were to be upheld, will have the

effect that the relationship of landlord and tenant between Velaudham Pillai (the

predecessor in title of the Plaintiff) and Defendant came to an end as far back as

29/07/1982 when Velaudham Pillai the landlord effected a conditional transfer in

favor of Premadasa~the tenant~see the Deed bearing No 988 dated 29/07/1982

L marked as P4.

Confusio

This argument owes its origin to the taxonomy of confusio and the Counsel for the

Plaintifr Appellant have both cited the following passage.

"Confusio, as a mode of extinguishing a right, occurs when two incompatible rights are

united in one and the same person.

, Discharge of a contractual obligation by confusion, or merger is not based on

performance or on waiver, but on the principle that a person cannot in the same capacity

be his own creditor and debtor.

Thus, under a contract of tenancy, the obligations of the tenant would be extinguished

by operation of law if the title to the leased premises vests in the tenant, after the contract

is entered into. Once the acquisition of title by the tenant is shown to have taken place,

the capacities of landldrd and tenant become united in one person, so that there is no

longer any scope for recognition of a contract of tenancy" G.L. Peiris ''Landlord

and Tenant" Vo12. page 548 Chapter 28.

This position was also upheld in V. Visvalingam vs. D. De S. Ga;aweera 56 NLR ill "where the Plaintiff Appellant had let certain premises to the Defendant

Respondent on a non~no41rial document. Admittedly he was not the owner of

the premises. He brought ~}le present action to have the Defendant ejected on the

ground that rent was in arrears. Defendant pleaded that he had purchased from

the owners a portion of the premises and taken on lease the remainder and that,

consequently, the capacity of landlord and tenant had become merged in him.

Held that, even assuming that the Defendant had become owner of the entire premises, it was not

open for him to refuse to surrender possession to his landlord. He must first give up possession,

and then it would be open to hirn to litigate about the ownership".

It was contended on thei,cJines that even if the Mortgage Bond bearing No 1337

and dated 19th October 1984 (P3) did not exist, the Defendant cou1d not plead

the defense of tenancy as tenancy between Velaudham Pillai and the Defendant

had come to a halt on 29th July 1982 on account of the conditional transfer

evidenced in the deed bearing No. 988.

But it would appear that there was a re/conveyance of the premises when the

; Defendant re/transferred the disputed premises to Velaudhan Pillai in fulfillment

of the condition stipulated in deed of conditional transfer bearing No. 988. This

deed bearing No. 1253 dated 16/ 05/ 1984 (PS) shows that the title of the premises

reverted to Veludhan Pillai in 1984. And therefore the question becomes moot

I whether the Roman Law concept of confusio would ever apply to the reversible

nature of the relationship that arose between Velaudham Pilai and the

Defendant, because of the ~:onditional transfer. [ In general, the doctrine of, confusio related to corporeal property and it was the

Roman term for the mixtures of goods in such a way that it was not readily

reversible. In other words the temporary transfer of title to the tenant was not a

true instance of a not readily reversible mixture/(si mixti essent, ita ut discerni non

possent)

The Romans did in fact u~ the term confusio for corporeal things, but in a more

limited sense: where the right and liability came to vest in the same person (see,

e.g. W.W. Buckland, A T ext/Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian, yd ed. rev.

P. Stein (Cambridge 1963), 563/64), such as where one party was the heir (heires)

of the other. Similarly, servitudes could be terminated when the same person

became the dominus of both the dominant and the servient land nemini res sua servit.

D.8.6.1. (Gaius 7Ed. prov.)andJ.A.C. Thomas, Textbook ofRoamn Law (Amsterdam

1976),201. The same principle applied to a debt.

Therefore, on the facts before this court there was never any confusio, only a

substitution for each other for two years. The conditional transfer was not an

irreversible mixture. (see: Lords Hoffman and Hope in invoking confusio in the

case of Foskette vs. McKeown 20011 A.C. 190 ( House of Lords). Leaving aside

the confusio, there is evidence in the case which attests to the revival of tenancy

rights in favor of the Def~ndant if at all he had lost that right owing to the

conditional transfer.

It so happened that after the Defendant re/transferred the property on 16/05/1984

the landlord Velaudham Pillai refused to accept the. rent but, the Defendant

testified that he sent the rent by money order under registered post with a

covering letter for each money order stating the period for which it was paid.

Such letters, money orders and registered articles were produced marked as e; 2

to e; 22. When these documents were produced, the counsel for the plaintiff

took up an objection to these documents on the ground that since there is no

proof that these documents reached the Plaintiff they should be marked subject

to proof, and the court has allowed that application. (See/ proceedings dated

18/06/1992). Under section 16 of the Evidence Ordinance it is sufficient that a

letter is posted and if proof is adduced to prove the posting, further proof is not

necessary. (See/ Section 16 of the Evidence Ordinance and illustration (b).) The

Illustration (B) denotes thus;

"The question is whether a particular letter reached "A" that it was posted in due course

and was not returned through the dead letter office are relevant"

This section has been interpreted in, Sawarimutthu vs. Edwin De Silva 75 NLR

394.

In this case the question was whether the quite notice was given to the tenant.

Samarawickrema J. held, "that having regard to section 16 and 114(e) of the Evidence

Ordinance, the facts proved gave rise to the presumption that the notice to quite was served on

the Defendant"

In these circumstances a presumption is drawn by court under section 114(e) of

the Evidence Ordinance. It says thus;

"That the common course of business has been followed" in a particular case"

This presumption was indeed drawn by Justice Samarawickrema in the above

mentioned case. When a letter is posted, the: presumption is the common course

of business namely the delivery had occurred. In the present case as well, the

defendant had produced postal registered articles to prove the posting of his

letters and money order~s. The copies of letters and money orders were also

produced. Once the proot, of posting is tendered the presumption is that the

letter has been delivereq, unless the person who posted it says they were

returned undelivered. In this case the defendant has not said that they were

returned. He said he did not receive it back. Therefore, these documents e5 2 to

e5 22 need not be proved by calling any other witness, in terms of Sections 16 and

114( e ) of the Evidence Ordinance and in the light of the authority cited above,

although they have been marked subject to proof, the fact that rent was received t by Velaudham Piliai rem2)_nS proved. The presumptive evidence in regard to

\.,! these documents that aris;::.s in terms of Section 114 (e) of the Evidence Ordinance

has been not be rebutted and as such presumptive evidence has turned

conclusive in proof of the tenancy between Velaudharn Piliai and the Defendant.

The proof of tenancy Vias also advanced by the Defendant's witness one

Guneratne. He testified that he was the tenant of premises No.26, under the

Velaudham PiliaL He alsE' paid Rs. 40.00// as rent for his occupation. Th~

Defendant had been in hi;:.; occupation of premises No. 22 as a tenant under

Velaudham Piliai paying a monthly Rent of Rs. 40.00/.

Thus there is overwhelming evidence to prove that the Defendant~ Respondent

had been a tenant under Velaudam PillaL The Appellant was unable to shake the

overwhelming evidence that was available to show the Respondent's long

tenancy at the said premises.

lam in complete agreement with the learned Additional District Judge of Kegalle

that the mortgage bond bearing No 1337 and dated 19.10.1984 was not a mortgage

in fact and in law. Therefore the conclusion reached by the learned Additional

District Judge of Kegalle that this mortgage bond which was fraudulently

executed is incapable of being cancelled as it did not act in esse, is unassailable.

In the circumstances the appeal of the Plaintiff~ Appellant has to be disallowed

subject to an observation. ;,t he Plaintiff had sought in his plaint a declaration of

title on the strength of the deed bearing No 2773 execqted on 12.12.1985 (PI). In

fact Issue No I raised by the Plaintiff was based on this averment and the learned

Additional District Judge answer this issue in favour of the Plaintiff. But the

learned Additional District Judge did not make a pronouncement of declaration

of title in favour of the Plaintiff. The learned Aq.ditional District Judge

" straightaway dismissed tht; act filed by the Plaintiff.

In view of the fact that PI was admitted by the Defendant, this Court varies the

judgement of the court a quo in that the declaration of title sought by the Plaintiff

has to be allowed. To this extent the appeal of the Plaintiff is partially allowed.

In the overall context, subject to the variation above, the judgement of the

learned Additional Distri~t Judge delivered on 6.12.1996 is affirmed and the

appeal of the Plaintiff~ Appellant's dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
