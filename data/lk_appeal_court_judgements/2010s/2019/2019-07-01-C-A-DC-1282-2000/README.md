A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

The original Plaintiff instituted this action by a plaint dated 06.05.1992, seeking to eject

the 1st and 2nd Defendants from premises bearing Assessment No. 34, Warakatota Road,

Ratnapura (previous Assessment No.16). The Plaintiff instituted this action on two

grounds, namely,

a. Arrears of rent; and

b. Sub-letting the said premises by the 1st Defendant to the 2nd Defendant.

The 1st Defendant filed his answer dated 08.06.1993 and denied the claims of the Plaintiff

and prayed, inter alia for a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action. The 2A Defendant too filed an

undated answer and prayed for a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action.

The matter was taken up for trial on 13.10.1997 where two admissions were recorded,

whereby there were admissions to the effect that the Plaintiff had let the said premises to

one KW. Liyanage and upon his death the Defendant Ananda Liyanage became the

tenant of the said premises under the Plaintiff and that the said premises was governed

by the Rent Act, No.7 of 1972 (as amended).

As for issues the Plaintiff raised Issues Nos.1 to 5 among which Issue No.2 raised by the

Plaintiff was whether the 1st Defendant without the written authority of the Plaintiff

sub-let the said premises to the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant raised Issues Nos.6 to 11

and the 2A Defendant raised Issues Nos.12 and 13.

On behalf of the Plaintiff, her son Ahamed Jiffrey Mohamed Akbar, Upali Hemachandra-

a clerk from the Ratnapura Municipal Council and Gurubavila Lekamlage Don

Karunadasa gave evidence and documents "PI" to "P3" and "Y" were marked in

evidence.

During the pendency of the action, the 1st Defendant passed away and at the trial his

widow the lA Defendant gave evidence with the adduction of documentary evidence VI

to V53A. The 2A Defendant did not call any witnesses to testify.

In a judgment dated 05.10.2000 the learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiff's

action.

It is against this judgment that the Plaintiff has preferred this appeal.

Upon a perusal of the judgment it is clear that the learned trial Judge has rejected the

first cause of action relied upon by the Plaintiff, namely, arrears of rent on the basis of

which the tenancy of the Defendant was terminated by letter marked PI dated

lO.02.1986, but the action was filed five years later on 06.05.1992 and after the said letter

PI rent had been deposited in the Municipal Council, and the Plaintiff had not sent a

second letter of Demand terminating the tenancy prior to filing action.

The Plaintiff had admitted to the defect vin the first cause of action in her written

submissions to the District Court.

Then the question remains whether the alleged sub~letting of the said premises by the tt

Defendant to the 2nd Defendant in the second cause of action has been established.

The Plaintiff took the stance that the 1st Defendant sub~let the said premises to several

persons during various periods of time and from 1991 sub~let the said premises to the 2nd

Defendant. The Plaintiff's position was that the 1st Defendant could not take advantage of

the benefit of the Rent Act, and was therefore liable to be ejected in terms of Section

lO(2) of the Rent Act.

The learned District Judge proceeded to reject the second cause of action mainly on the

ground that no notice of termination of the tenancy had been given to the 1st Defendant

as regards subletting. It is the decision of the District Court that a condition precedent

to institution of action on the ground of sub~letting was a letter of demand and no cause

of action lies without this condition being satisfied~see page 164 2nd paragraph, and 1661st

paragraph.

It has to be noted that nowhere in Section lO(2) of the Rent Actis found a specific

reference to giving of a notice terminating the tenancy before filing action in relation to

a cause of action based on sub~letting.

4

It was contended before this Court that if the 1st Defendant had sub~let the premises to

the 2nd Defendant without the prior written approval of the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant

had infringed the provisions of Section 10(2) of the Rent Act. The cause of action arises

from the mere fact of subletting andin such a situation it was contended that no notice of

termination of a tenancy was necessary before an action for ejectment on the basis of

sublettingwas instituted.

The learned' Counsel for the Plaintiff~Appellant cited Wimalasooriya v. Ponniah 52

N.LR 191 wherein it has been held, inter alia, that, "where a tenant sub~let the leased

premises in contravention of section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act, No.29 of 1948, the

landlord is entided to institute proceedings in ejectment without terminating the

tenancy by notice". Section 9 of the Rent Restriction Act, No.29 of 1948 is identical to

Section 10 of the Rent Act.

I take the view that the learned District Judge was in error on this question of law

namely termination of tenancy was mandatory before action was filed on the basis of

su b~ letting.

The question then arises whether sub~letting has been established within the four

comers of Section 10(2) of the Rent Act. It is the decision of the learned District Judge

that the Plaintiff has not established the conditions stipulated in Section 10(2) of the said

Rent Act.

Turning to evidence one finds that the Plaintiff's son Mohamed Akbar testified that the

1st Defendant had sub~let the said premises to the 2nd Defendant to carry on a business of

a jewelry workshop~see pages 76, 79 83 and 84 of the Appeal Brief.

This evidence was corroborated by the testimony of Gurubavila Lekamlage Don

Karunadasa who stated that he had provided security services to the jewelry workshop

and a document detailing the relevant Security Services Agreement was marked as Y ~see

pages 122 and 123 of the Appeal Brief, and document marked "Y" at page 297 of the

Appeal Brief.

5

The learned trial Judge has rejected the said evidence on the basis that there had been

litigation between the said witness and the tt Defendant, and therefore the said witness

was unworthy of credit.

Be that as it may, notwithstanding the fact that there was litigation between the witness

and the 1st Defendant, the totality of evidence has to be evaluated to ascertain whether

subletting has been proved.

The said witness Karunadasa explained that the litigation was in relation to non~

payment of EPF. It was established that the 1st Defendant had worked as a security guard

under the said witness Karunadasa.

Therefore the 1st Defendant could not have carried on the business of hiring loudspeakers

at the said premises whilst at the same time working as a security guard under the said

witness Karunadasa.

The learned District Judge has also not considered the cross~examination of the witness

Karunadasa on behalf of the 2nd Defendant, which clearly establishes that the 2nd

Defendant had carried on a business jewelry workshop at the said premises. (Vide pages

131 and 132 of the Appeal Brief).

In the circumstances the testimony of Karunadasa that he provided security services to

the jewelry workshop situated in the said premises which jewelry workshop was owned

by the 2nd Defendant had to be accepted. The fact that the 1st Defendant had worked as a

security guard under Karunadasa is borne out by Karundasa's evidence and in my view

the previous litigation between the 1st Defendant and Karunadasa does not cast a dent on

the truthfulness of Karunadasa's evidence.

On the other hand the 1st Defendant admittedly at one time carried on a business of

hiring loudspeakers. The 1st Defendant did not have a jewelry workshop as his own

business. Therefore it is evident that the jewelry workshop carried on the said premises

was someone else's business, which clearly proves that the 1st Defendant had sub~let the

said premises without any authority from the Plaintiff.

6

It would appear that the learned District Judge has misdirected on these facts and such

misdirection would amount to an error of law.

It is commonplace that sub~letting is done in secrecy and there is a string of authorities

for the proposition that when a Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of sub~letting the

burden shifts to the Defendant to explain the nature of the occupation of the alleged sub~

tenant.

Sangadasa v. Hussain and Another (1999) 2 Sri LR 395, at page 397 is a case in point of

fact:~

"What is the nature of the burden cast on a Plaintiff Landlord who alleges sub~1etting? It is too

well known that the act of sub~letting (without the permission of the landlord) of rent controlled

premises is done in stealth for obvious reasons. The Landlord may not be able to ascertain the true

nature of the occupation of the sub~tenant with precision because that is usually a matter within

the exclusive knowledge of tenant and sub~tenant only. In these circumstances, it is sufficient for

the landlord to establish a prima facie case of sub~letting and the burden then shifts to the tenant

to explain the nature of occupation of the alleged sub~tenant."

The dicta of Thaha v. Sadeen 72 N.LR 142, at page 144, is to the same effect:~

"Sub~letting, without consent, as can well be imagined, is unlike letting. It is done by the tenant in

stealth for his profit. The landlord may in the generality of cases never know whether his premises

were sub~let. Proof of sub~letting is in the circumstances, invariably difficult to obtain, and if in

addition, it is required that the landlord should establish the date of sub~letting, it will be casting

on the landlord a well nigh impOSSible burden. My interpretation of this section is that at whatever

time it is discovered that the premises have been sub~let then on that discovery the cause of action

arises."

The learned trial Judge has not borne in mind the aforesaid principles and fell into an

error by concluding that the Plaintiff had failed to prove the sub~letting.

7

The learned trial Judge has also not considered the fact that the 1st Defendant had passed

away and only his widow gave evidence. Even though she merely denied sub letting, she

has not explained how her husband ran a loud speaker hiring business, whilst working

as a security guard.

The learned trial Judge has also stated that this action has been filed as an ejectment and

damages action but it should have been filed a rent and ejectment action, and therefore

the Plaintiff from the beginning has based his case on a wrong footing~vide page 166.

But upon a perusal of the plaint it is clear that the said premises is governed by the Rent

Act and the 1st Defendant was the tenant of the Plaintiff, and it was established at the

trail that the 1st Defendant had sub~let the said premises to the 2nd Defendant. In the

circumstances one cannot proceed to dismiss the Plaintiff as defective merely because

the caption of the plaint states ejectment and damages. It is the fact in issue and the

evidence led thereon which brings out the scope and nature of the action.

After the plaint had been accepted and a trial had proceeded on the said plaint, one

cannot now classify the plaint as defective.

A perusal of the admissions and issues clearly bring out the scope of the action~see page

66. Issue No.2 is in relation to sub~letting of the said premises to the 2nd Defendant. The

trial had proceeded on the said issues and it is axiomatic that once the issues are raised

pleadings recede to the background~see Dharmasiri v. Wickrematunga (2002) 2 Sri L.R

218 which reiterates the long established principle that 'once issues are framed and

accepted, pleadings recede to the background'.

In the circumstances one cannot now look back at the caption and dismiss the action on

the ground that the plaint is defective. No issue has been raised to the effect that the

action cannot be maintained because the plaint is presented as an ejectment and

damages action.

On a consideration of the totality of evidence I take the view that the learned District

Judge erred in fact and law in dismissing the Plaintiff's action and as the Plaintiff has

8

.

established sub~letting, I would set aside the judgment of the learned trial Judge dated

05.10.2000 and allow this appeal holding that the judgment is entered in favour of the

Plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint.
