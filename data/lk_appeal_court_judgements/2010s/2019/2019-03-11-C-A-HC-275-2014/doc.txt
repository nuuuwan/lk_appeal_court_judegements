A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted under Section 296 of the Penal Code in the High Court of Colombo for

causing the death of Millage Sarath Fernando (hereinafter referred to as the

deceased) in the 1 st count and for causing simple hurt to Don Liyanapathiranage

Sisira Kumara, in the 2nd count, an offence punishable under Section 315 of the

Penal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the Appellant was found guilty in the 1 st

count and was sentenced to death. He was acquitted in the 2nd count.

3

Aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant has raised the

following grounds of appeal;

(l) has the learned trial judge relied on the uncorroborated testimony of

PWI to convict the Appellant

(2) was there sufficient light at the scene of the crime to have made a

positive identification of the Appellant

(3) has the learned trial judge taken into consideration the contradictory

nature in evidence regarding the place where the deceased had fallen

after the attack

The wife of the deceased, Erandi Neranjana (PWl), states that around 10

PM on the date of the incident, she heard footsteps from the rear compound of the

house, and she felt the presence of a person. She thought that the deceased was

trying to frighten her. Around 5 to 10 minutes later the deceased had tapped at the

window and wanted her to prepare dinner for "Sisira Uncle" (Sisira) as well, who

lived in a shack in the compound of the house. PWI had alerted the deceased of

the unusual sound she heard from the rear compound of the house and the

deceased had gone to check on it. A while later she had heard the deceased saying,

Sunil why are you hear.

Sunil, identified by PWI as the Appellant, is a close relation of the

deceased who lived 20 to 30 meters away from the house of the deceased. The

4

witness speaks of an animosity which prevailed between the parties regarding a

land dispute. PWI did not like the presence of the Appellant in their compound at

that time of the night. Being curious, she had gone close to the window, where she

saw the Appellant with his arm around the deceased. The deceased had wanted her

to bring a glass of water and when she went out with the glass in hand, she heard

the deceased saying "Baba Aiye". Baba Aiya is a person who lives close to the

house of the deceased, under whom the deceased was employed. At that moment

the witness had seen the Appellant pulling a knife out from the chest of the

deceased. She also heard Sisira shouting, Sunil what have you done to him. PWI

had seen the Appellant standing under the street light looking down on the

deceased fallen on the ground. Later she had seen sisira with bleeding injuries on

his hand. The said injured was not present in the High Court nor his deposition in

the non-summery inquiry admitted as evidence, in terms of the Evidence

Ordinance. The Appellant was arrested less than 2 hrs. after the attack. A knife

recovered from the Appellant at the time of arrest was not produced in evidence.

The fact that the knife was recovered from the possession of the Appellant, was

not challenged by the defence.

In cross examination PWl, stated that from the street light she saw the

compound of the house and beyond, extending up to the road. We observe that in

cross examination, not a single question has been posed to the witness regarding

the light condition or a mistaken identity of the Appellant. We also observe that

5

Contradictions marked VI and V2, are related to events prior to the attack taking

place and does not go to the root of this incident which could impeach the

credibility of the evidence given by PWl.

According to the medical evidence, death was caused due to hemorrhage

and hemothorax due to penetrating stab injury to the aorta.

In the light of the said evidence, I will now tum to the 1 st and 2nd grounds of

appeal.

The stand taken by the defence is that, since the eye witness heard the

deceased uttering the name of "Baba Aiya", there is a possibility that "Baba Aiya"

is the person who stabbed the deceased.

It is in evidence, that the deceased had identified the Appellant at the scene

of the crime moments before the attack took place and was surprised to see him in

the compound of his house at that time of the day. At the time of the attack the

Appellant has been clearly identified by the eye witness pulling a knife out from

the chest of the deceased. The eye witness does not speak to the presence of Baba

Aiya. However, the stand taken by the counsel for the Appellant that Baba Aiya

stabbed the deceased was never put to this witness. Therefore, the eye witness

evidence on this point stands unchallenged.

In the case of Ajitlt Samarakoon vs. State 2004 2 SLR page 209 at page

230 Ninian Jayasuriya, J., observed that;

"evidence not challenged or impugned in cross examination can be

considered as admitted and is provable against the accused. "

6

In Edrick de Silva vs. Chandradasa de Silva 70 NLR page 169 at 170

Justice H.N.G. Fernando, observed that;

"Where there is ample opportunity to contradict the evidence of a

witness but is not impugned or assailed in cross examination that is

a special fact and feature in the case. It is a matter falling within the

definition of the word "prove" in section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance, and a trial Judge or court must necessarily take that fact

into consideration in adjudicating the issue before it. "

In this case, after lengthy cross examination, the eye witness evidence

stands strong and even though uncorroborated, can be safely acted upon.

IP Upul Samarasinghe (PW7), the investigating officer who arrived at the

scene at 00.10 AM, on 24/08/2005, has observed that there was sufficient light at

the scene of the crime emanating from the street light and from a bulb burning

inside the house. He has identified the deceased fallen close to the street light and

also has observed blood marks stretching from the scene of the crime to the place

where the deceased was found fallen with injuries.

Even though, the Appellant has serious concerns about the light condition

at the time of identifying the Appellant by the eye witness, the defence has failed

.. 7

to suggest or to draw any inference that the prevailing light was not sufficient for a

proper identification. On the contrary PW7 has observed that there was sufficient

light at the scene of the crime. The doubt urged regarding the light condition and

of the identification of the Appellant should have necessarily put in cross

examination to the investigating officer or any other officer who participated in the

investigation, which the defence has failed to do. In the circumstances we are

convinced that the identification of the Appellant by the eye witness is proved

beyond any reasonable doubt.

The 3rd ground of appeal is in relation to the evidence of PWI and the

evidence of PW7 regarding the place where the injured fell after the attack. PW7

clearly states that he observed blood marks from the place of attack to the place

where the deceased was fallen. P.S. Gamaathige Lionel, (PW9), in his evidence

states that, he had observed blood marks from the compound of the house to the

place where the deceased was fallen. This clearly shows that there has been a

movement of the deceased from the place of attack to where he was fallen. An

alternate position has not been taken up or suggested to any of the prosecution

witnesses by the defence. Accordingly, we see no infirmity in acting upon the said

evidence by the trial judge.

In CA Appeal 78-80/2001, Ranjith Silva J. cited with approval the

judgment in Fraad Vs. Brown & Company Ltd., 20 NLR at page 283, where the

Privy Council observed that;

"It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit upon a

point of fact purely, is over ruled by a Court of Appeal, because the

Court of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a Judge of

first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any

Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or from

narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in questions

of veracity so direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will

over-rule a judge of first instance. "

8

F or all the above reasons, we are of the view that the conviction should

stand. Accordingly, the conviction dated 2411112014 and the corresponding

sentence is affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
