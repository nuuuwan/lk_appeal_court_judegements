Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendants in the

District Court of Kalutara seeking declarations that (a) he is the

owner of the land described in the second schedule to the plaint,

and (b) he is entitled to a right of way of 8 feet wide along the

northern boundary of the land described in the third schedule to

the plaint, which is morefully depicted as Lot1A in Plan No.

7700 marked P11, to have access to the land described in the

second schedule to the plaint.

The defendants did not contest the relief (a) above, but contested

the relief (b) above. The position of the defendants was that the

plaintiff was not entitled to such a right of way.

After trial, the learned District Judge held with the defendants

on relief (b). Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.

The land described in the second schedule to the plaint is Lot 3

of Modarayawatta2, and the land described in the third schedule

to the plaint, which is the southern boundary of

Modarayawatta, is Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta.3 Both these

lands had earlier belonged to Mebel whose children are

Sriyalatha and Thilakadasa.

Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta is 27.5 perches in extent.

1 Vide page 59 of the brief. 2 Vide Plan No.39/1993 marked P4 at page 357 of the brief. 3 Vide Plan No.2320 marked P3 at page 355 of the brief.

Mebel by deed No.997 dated 23.01.1980 marked 1D14 has

transferred undivided 13 perches from Lot 1 of

Eramudugahawatta including the house bearing Assessment

No.253/1 to the defendants. The defendants admit that5 the

said house was located to the western portion of Lot 1, and it is

also crystal clear by reading the schedule to the subsequent

deed No.3170.6

In addition to the soil rights, Mebel by the same deed No.997

also granted a right of way of 8 feet wide along the northern

boundary of the said Lot 1 to have access to house No.253/17,

which was in the western side of Lot 1.

Thereafter Mebel by deed No.3170 dated 01.08.1981 marked

1D2 has donated the balance portion of Lot 1, 14.5 perches in

extent, which lies to the eastern side of Lot 1, to the daughter,

Sriyalatha.8 By this deed, Mebel donated the whole soil rights of

the balance portion of Lot 1 to Sriyalatha without any reference

to the servitude created over northern boundary for a right of

way by the earlier deed No.997 in favour of the defendants.

Although no reference has been made in the said deed No.3170,

the law is that the benefit to the dominant tenement and the

burden to the servient tenement of a real servitude are

inseparable from the land to which they are attached, in that,

they pass with the land to every succeeding owner.9

That means, the donation by deed 3170 shall be subject to the

servitutal right created earlier by deed No.997 in favour of the

defendants for 8 foot right of way along the northern boundary

of Lot 1.

Mebel, immediately after executing deed 3170 referred to above,

has executed deed 3171 through the same Notary to donate

Modarayawatta to her two children, Sriyalatha (the donee in

deed No.3170) and Thilakadasa.10 It may be recalled that

northern boundary of Eramudugahawatta is Modarayawatta.

By deed 3171, Mebel gave share of Modarayawatta (from the

western side) to Thilakadasa, and the balance share of

Modarayawatta (from the eastern side) to Sriyalatha. In

addition to the said soil rights, Mebel, by the same deed, granted

to both of them, a right of way of 8 feet wide, along the northern

boundary of Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta, to have access to

Modarayawatta.

The question is whether Mebel could create a right of way over

Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta to have access to Modarayawatta

when she was not the owner of the servient tenement of Lot 1 of

Eramudugahawatta.

Obviously, a person who is not the owner of the servient

tenement cannot create a servitude of right way over it.

But in the facts and circumstances of this case, which I narrated

above, there is a confusion about the two donations made by

Mebel by the said two deeds 3170 and 3171 in relation to the

right of way. In such circumstances, the Court is entitled to

ascertain the intention of the parties.

In Appuhamy v. Gallella11, it was held that:

Where the extent of a grant of land is stated in an ambiguous

manner in a conveyance, it is legitimate to look at the

conveyance in the light of the circumstances which

surrounded it in order to ascertain what was therein

expressed as the intention of the parties. It is permissible to

resort to extrinsic evidence in order to resolve the ambiguity

relating to the subject matter referred to in the conveyance. In

such circumstances it is proper to have regard to the

subsequent conduct of each of the parties, especially when

such conduct amounts to an admission against the partys

proprietory interest.

In Jeyasingham v. De Almeida12, it was held that:

[W]here different parts of a deed are inconsistent with each

other, effect ought to be given to that part which is calculated

to carry into effect the real intention of the parties, and that

part which would defeat it should be rejected.

Although those two decisions relate to inconsistencies in the

deeds themselves, the same principle, in my view, can be applied

11 (1976) 78 NLR 404 12 (1952) 54 NLR 416

6

to the facts of this case where two deeds 3170 and 3171 were

executed by the same Notary, at the same time, one after the

other.

In the facts of this case, the intention of Mabel was clear. That

was to donate the eastern portion of Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta

by deed No.3170 to Sriyalatha subject to a right of way of 8 feet

wide along the northern boundary of the eastern part thereof to

have access to Modarayawatta to the benefit of both Sriyalatha

and Thilakadasa. This has been accepted by Sriyalatha by

subsequent conduct.

In my view, although the intention of Mabel was clear, the

mistake has been done by the Notary. He should have first

executed deed No.3171 and then 3170. Had that been done,

there would not have been any room for argument, for the

reason that, as the owner of the eastern part of Lot 1 of

Eramudugahawatta, Mebel, without any difficulty, could have

granted a right of way to Sriyalatha and Thilakadasa along the

northern boundary of the eastern part of Lot 1 of

Eramudugahawatta to have access to Modarayawatta.

At that time, that would not have been an issue to the

defendants, as they were also using the same right of way by

virtue of the right given to them by deed No.997 to have access

to the western portion of Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta.

7

Thereafter, Sriyalatha, by deed No.301 dated 06.08.1987

marked 1D3 has transferred what she got from deed No.3170 to

the 1st defendant.13

Although it has not been expressly stated in deed 301, upon the

principal that servitude is inseparable from the land to which it

is attached and it passes with the land to every succeeding

owner, the 1st defendant has got title to the eastern side of Lot 1

of Eramudugahawatta by deed 301 subject to the said servitude

over that portion of the land.

Thilakadasa, by deed 719 dated 14.07.1993, has transferred the

said servitudal right which he got from deed 3171, to the

plaintiff.14

As the servitude is attached to the land and goes with the land,

the plaintiff as the new owner of Modarayawatta is entitled to

use that right of way.

Let me now identify the cardinal errors committed by the learned

District Judge in the Judgment.

When I read the Judgment, it is clear to me that the learned

District Judge has mixed up the facts of this case, which has led

him to come to erroneous findings.

In the Judgment the learned Judge states that, Mebel, by deed

No.997 has transferred all her rights (except the house bearing

assessment No.251) to Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta, including

the strip of land meant for the right of way, to the defendants;

13 Vide deed No.301 at page 296 of the brief. 14 Vide deed No.719 at page 275 of the brief.

8

and therefore, Mebel could not have alienated a portion of land

from Lot 1 by deed No.3171 subsequently.15 This finding is

factually incorrect. As I have already discussed, Mebel did not

transfer her entire rights to Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta except

house No.251 to the defendants by deed No.997.

Then the learned Judge says that, as seen from the second

schedule to deed No.997, Mebel has also sold 23.5 perches from

Lot 1 of Eramudugahawatta. He further says that, in order to

have access to house No.253/1 located therein, the right to use

a strip of land of 8 feet wide has also been sold.16 These findings

are also factually incorrect.

Then the learned Judge says that, once Mebel by deed No.997

sold a strip of land of 8 feet wide as a servitude for a right of

way, Mebel cannot thereafter by deed 3171 sell the same to

Thilakadasa.17 This finding is also wrong in fact and in law.

Mebel did not sell a strip of land to use as a right of way either

by deed No.997 or 3171. She only granted the right to use that

strip of land as a road. As the owner of the servient tenement,

at that time, Mebel could have granted the right to use to more

than one person.

The issues shall be answered in the following manner:

1. Yes.

2. Yes.

15 Vide last paragraph of page 196 of the brief which continues to page 197 and the second paragraph of page 197 of the brief. 16 Vide last paragraph of page 197 of the brief which continues to page 198 of the brief. 17 Vide last paragraph of page 198 of the brief.

3. Yes.

4. Yes.

5. Yes.

6. Yes. The plaintiff is entitled to the said right of way

also by operation of law as explained in the Judgment.

7. Yes.

8. Yes.

9. Depicted as 1A.

10. Yes.

11. Yes.

12. Does not arise.

15. No.

16. (i) Yes.

(ii) Does not arise.

17. (i) No.

(ii) Yes.

18. Does not arise.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the Judgment of the

District Court and direct the learned District Judge to enter

Judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in paragraphs (a) and (b)

of the prayer to the plaint. The relief in paragraph (b) shall be

10

confined to Lot 1A of Plan No.7700 marked P1 at the trial. I

make no order as to costs.
