The original Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant")

Hewa Radhage Dasa alias Ranasooriyadasa has preferred this appeal to this Court against

the judgment of the Additional District Judge of Embilipitiya dated 21.09.2000 which had

allowed the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff-Respondent in this case. By a plaint dated

09.09.1991, the Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action against the original Defendant praying for a declaration of title and

ejectment of the Defendant and his agent/employee from the land more fully referred to in

the schedule to the plaint.

The cause of action set out against the Defendant in the plaint is on the basis that the

Plaintiff had long become the owner of the land described in the schedule to the Plaint by

virtue of a deed of transfer bearing No.1714 and executed in his favor on 23cd May 1974. The

Plaintiff, after a narrative of how he had been in possession and subsequently acquired

seisin of the land, states in the plaint that he allowed the Defendant to occupy the house on

the land temporarily and left for a place called Mahahilla in 1985. He received a letter dated

29.05.1986 from the Mahaweli Authority saying that his land would no longer be required

for acquisition and he was free to do what he would like to do with his land. The Plaintiff

alleged further in his plaint that for the purpose of undertaking cultivation on the land the

Plaintiff served a notice to quit on the Defendant but the Defendant continued to stay on

the land and repudiated all attempts of the Plaintiff to regain possession of the house and

the land depicted in the schedule to the plaint. Moreover the plaint averred that the

2

Defendant had been in forcible possession of the land and by his continuous dispossession

he had been suffering damages in a sum of Rs.2,OOO/- per annum. So in the premises the

Plaintiff prayed for a declaration of title to the land depicted in the schedule to the plaint

and ejectment of the Defendant therefrom.

The land was depicted in the schedule to the plaint as a portion of a land called

"Kiralawelkatuwa" and the boundaries of the land were described as follows:-

North

East

South

West

: The land on which a Rice Mill belonging to one H.W. Siridiyas is situated.

: A portion of a land called 'Kiralawdkatuwa'.

: A land on which stands a 'Hunu Kotuwa'

: Hambantoca-Ratnapura main road.

As opposed to this plaint, the original Defendant filed his answer dated 1

st July 1992

denying the averments that pertained to the title of the Plaintiff in relation to the land

depicted in the plaint and that would mean that all averments of the Plaintiff that he

permitted the Defendant to occupy the house on the land would remain denied. The

Defendant further averred in his answer that he had been occupying the land depicted in

schedule to his answer since 1966 and in subsequent averments he staked a declaration of

title to the land which he had depicted in the schedule to the answer. The subsequent

averments in the answer focus on the Defendant's chain of title to the land described in the

Schedule to the answer and describe as to how he derives title to his property. The answer

further states that the Defendant has acquired prescriptive title to the said land quite

independently of the rights of the Plaintiff.

A perusal of the schedule to the answer shows different boundaries which are distinct and

different from those described in the Schedule to the Plaint. It has to be noted that the land

that was depicted in the schedule to the plaint has the following boundaries:

North

South

East

:Anura Rice Mill, Cart Road and the Land belonging to Galhatumba Kalu

Mahaththaya.

: The land belonging to S.H. Gunadasa.

: The land belonging to G.M. James.

3

West : Ratnapura-Homagama main road.

A comparison of both the boundaries given to the lands depicted in the plaint and answer

quite clearly brings out the fact that the Plaintiff and the Defendant have claimed

ownership of two different lands.

If at all, only the western boundaries of both lands would tally because the western

boundaries of both lands appear to be identical.

At one stage, the land on which the Plaintiff had been in possession was due to be acquired

by the state and in fact the Plaintiff had been informed about the acquisition by 'Pl'.

Though the land was eventually acquired, the acquisition was subsequendy abandoned

and the devesting of the land had been communicated to the Plaintiff by the letter dated

29.05.1986 (P3). P2 is the deed of transfer bearing No.1714 by which the Plaintiff had

acquired tide to the property.

The notice under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act had been marked as P4 at the trial

and in terms of this notice, Lot D of Kiralawelkatuwa has been identified as the land of the

Plaintiff. P4 refers to an advanced tracing prepared by the Surveyor General wherein the

Plaintiff's land had been depicted as Lot D of the said advanced tracing. The learned

Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent contended that Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance

applies to this advanced tracing as Section 83states the following:-

"The Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor

General or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authOrity and are accurate: but maps,

plans, or surveys not so signed must be proved to be accurate."

Section 36 of the Evidence Ordinance makes statements in maps or plans under the

authority of Government relevant. Whilst Section 36 deals with relevancy, Section 83

creates a presumption as the document being duly made and being accurate. The

presumption of accuracy arises only in respect of those maps or plans which are made for a

public purpose and by the Surveyor General. It does not apply to private maps-see Shib

Charan Dey v. Mahato 17 CLJ 542.

4

" Survey maps prepared under the authority of Government are evidence of possession, and,

therefore, also of evidence of title-see 10 W.R. 343 (344).

In a case involving a boundary dispute, a survey map, if not conclusive evidence, is

evidence of an important character which ought to be looked into and considered-see IS

W.R. 3; 20 W.R. 243.

In the circumstances, one has to presume the accuracy of the Plan until the contrary is

established.

There was one Seelavathi Komasaru who gave evidence on behalf of the Mahaweli

Authority testified having regard to the Section 4 notice and the advanced tracing. Her

testimony was to the effect that the state recognized the Plaintiff as the owner of the

subject-matter. She also stated in evidence that a notification had been sent to the Plaintiff

stating that the land of the Plaintiff would not be needed for acquisition. All this testimony

goes to prove that the Plaintiff had sufficient title to file a rei vindicatio action. So much for

the evidence given on behalf of the Plaintiff.

This Court also draws its attention to the testimony offered by the Defendant. He was

specifically asked whether he was seeking a declaration to Lots 46, 47, 48, 49 and SO.

Having answered this question in the affirmative, the Defendant also admitted that the

Plaintiff was seeking relief in regard to Lot No.21O. This shows that both the Plaintiff and

the Defendant were seeking relief to two different lands.

In the circumstances, I take the view that the learned District Judge came to the right

decision in holding that the Plaintiff had established his case and I see no reason to disturb

the findings of the learned Additional District Judge of Embilipitiya. The documentary

evidence produced by the Defendant-Appellant has in anyway dented the case of the

Plaintiff-Respondent and I affirm the judgment dated 21.09.2000. Accordingly I proceed to

dismiss the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant.
