Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Nishan Premathiratne for the Petitioner.

Ganga Wakishta Arachchi, S.C.C., for the 1A, 2,

5A, 9A Respondents.

Yasas de Silva for the 6th and 7th Respondents.

Decided on: 06.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari the decision of the 3rd respondent (Minister of

Lands) as reflected in P22 and P23 to give the acquired land on a

long term lease to the 8th respondent (National Savings Bank),

and to compel the respondents (except the 8th) by way of writ of

mandamus to sell or to give the land on a long term lease to the

petitioner.

It is common ground that the land in question which was owned

by the petitioner was acquired under the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act, No.9 of 1950, as amended, for a public purpose,

i.e. to establish a bus terminus, and compensation was paid to

the petitioner. After sometime, the bus terminus was shifted to

another location. Thereafter the petitioner has endeavoured to

get back the land without success. The 3rd respondent has

afterwards changed the public purpose from bus terminus to

giving it to the 8th respondent on a long term lease to establish

the Kiribathgoda Branch of the National Savings Bank. The

3

gravamen of the complaint of the petitioner is that the whole

exercise is politically motivated.

Section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act deals with the subject of

Divesting of lands where actual possession has been taken. It

reads as follows:

39A. (1) Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under

section 38 (hereafter in this section referred to as a vesting

Order) any land has vested absolutely in the State and

actual possession of such land has been taken for or on

behalf of the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of

section 40, the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette (hereafter in this

section referred to as a divesting Order) divest the State of

the land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

(2) The Minister shall prior to making a divesting Order

under subsection (1) satisfy himself that

(a) no compensation has been paid under this Act to

any person or persons interested in the land in

relation to which the said divesting Order is to be

made;

(b) the said land has not been used for a public

purpose after possession of such land has been

taken by the State under the provisions of paragraph

(a) of section 40;

(c) no improvements to the said land have been

effected after the Order for possession under

paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made; and

4

(d) the person or persons interested in the said land

have consented in writing to take possession of such

land immediately after the divesting Order is

published in the Gazette.

Then it is clear that the petitioner cannot demand divesting in

view of at least section 39A(2)(a) requirement not being satisfied.

If I may repeat, The Minister shall prior to making a divesting

Order under subsection (1) satisfy himself that (a) no

compensation has been paid under this Act to any person or

persons interested in the land in relation to which the said

divesting Order is to be made. Admittedly, compensation was

paid to the petitioner after acquisition.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that

a nominal compensation was paid to the petitioner which is

alarmingly lower amount than the market value at the time of

acquisition. If that was the case, the petitioner was not without

a remedy. He could have, as provided in the Act (vide inter alia

sections 22 and 28) appealed to the Land Acquisition Board of

Review and then to the Court of Appeal. The petitioner has not

done so.

At this juncture it is relevant to refer to the Supreme Court case

of De Silva v. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and

Mahaweli Development [1993] 1 Sri LR 283. In that case Mark

Fernando J. at page 293 stated:

If compensation has been paid or improvements have been

made, then despite the inadequacy of justification,

divesting is not permitted. The purpose and the policy of the

5

amendment is to enable the justification for the original

acquisition, as well as for the continued retention of

acquired lands, to be reviewed; if the four conditions are

satisfied, the Minister is empowered to divest. Of course,

even in such a case it would be legitimate for the Minister to

decline to divest if there is some good reason-for instance,

that there is now a new public purpose for which the land

is required. In such a case it would be unreasonable to

divest the land; and then to proceed to acquire it again for

such new supervening public purpose. Such a public

purpose must be a real and present purpose, not a fancied

purpose or one which may become a reality only in the

distant future. The 1st respondent, however, has not given

any such reasons, and I cannot make any assumption in

his favour.

This Judgment was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court

of Kapugeekiyana v. Hon. Janaka Bandara Tennakone, Minister

of Land [2013] 1 Sri LR 192. Thilakawardena J. at pages 206-

207 stated:

It is the assessment of this Court that to grant a divesting

order on behalf of the Petitioner as per Section 39 A of the

Act, the four conditions set out in Section 39 A (2) must be

satisfied. It is not in dispute that the Respondents have

paid compensation to the Petitioner for acquiring his land

and furthermore a considerable amount of improvements

have been carried out on the land in preparation for

building houses. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to

divest the land.

6

Once again this Court is duty bound to follow the dictum

held by Justice Mark Fernando, in the case of De Silva Vs.

Atukorale, Minister of Lands, irrigation and Mahaweli

Development and Another (supra); it would be legitimate

for the minister to decline to divest if there is some good

reason-for instance, that there is now a new public purpose

for which the land is required. In such a case it "would be

unreasonable to divest the land, and then to proceed to

acquire it again for such new supervening public purpose.

Such a public purpose must be a real and present purpose,

not a fancied purpose or one, which may become a reality

only in the distant future.

From the above dicta there cannot be any doubt that if the

compensation has been paid as in this case divesting is not

possible. Therefore, the instant matter shall end there.

However, for completeness, I must add that not only the first

condition (non-payment of compensation), all four conditions in

section 39A(2) shall be satisfied for divesting order to be made.

The above dicta further establish that even if all four conditions

are satisfied the Minister can still decline to divest if there is

some good reasonfor instance, that there is now a new public

purpose for which the land is required. In the instant case, after

the bus terminus was shifted, the Minister states that there is a

new public purpose, i.e. giving the land on a long term lease to

the 8th respondent to establish Kiribathgoda Branch of the

National Savings Bank.

7

The learned counsel for the petitioner for the first time in the

written submissions (unknown to the respondents) has taken up

the position that the purported amended public purpose which is

to establish a branch of the 8th respondent does not qualify as a

public purpose as the 8th respondent bank is engaged in the

banking services which are commercial in nature and will benefit

only selected individuals mainly the customers of the 8th

respondent and therefore divesting can be compelled. The

learned counsel further states that the 8th respondent has no

actual interest in the land and they did not even file objections

to the petitioners application.

The National Savings Bank has filed no separate objections may

be because it is a state-owned Savings Bank and they have no

personal interests as private banks. However, the main

contenderthe Ministerwho has the authority to vest and

divest has filed objections. The argument that setting up a

branch of the National Savings Bank will benefit only selected

individuals mainly the customers of the 8th respondent bank is

unacceptable because in the case of other public purposes also,

the result is the same. For instance, a bus terminus will benefit

only a selected individualsbus commuters; a public library will

benefit only a selected individualsreaders; a schoolschool

going children etc.

If the decision of the 3rd respondent as reflected in P22 and P23

is not ultra vires, there is no room to quash it by way of

certiorari.

8

To issue a mandamus compelling the respondents to sell or give

on a long term lease of the land to the petitioner, the petitioner

must show that he has a legal right to the performance of a legal

duty by the respondents against whom mandamus is sought.

Mandamus is not intended to create a right but to restore a

party who has been denied his legal right. (Mageswaran v.

University Grants Commission [2003] 2 Sri LR 282, Perera v.

National Housing Development Authority [2001] 2 Sri LR 50,

Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education [2007] 2

Sri LR 281, Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd v. UDA[2008] 2 Sri LR 302,

Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferriee &

Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd[2005] 1 Sri LR 89) The petitioner manifestly

fails in this requirement.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
