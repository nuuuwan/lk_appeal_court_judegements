Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: A.S.M. Perera, P.C., for the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant.

S.A.D.S. Suraweera for the Plaintiff-

Respondent.

Decided on: 14.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this partition action naming two defendants to

partition the land described in the Preliminary Plan among the

plaintiff and the two defendants. The 3rd-5th defendants were

later made parties. After trial, the District Judge delivered the

Judgment dated 23.06.2000. It is against this Judgment, the

2nd defendant (hereinafter the appellant) has preferred this

appeal.

On behalf of the appellant, no written submissions were filed

either before or after the argument. On behalf of the plaintiff-

respondent, written submissions were filed both before and after

the argument. That shows the enthusiasm of the appellant in

prosecuting this appeal.

Let me now consider the contest, which the appellant raised at

the trial. The appellant raised 4th-7th issues at the trial.

By the 4th and 5th issues, the appellant claimed prescriptive title

to the entire land on the basis that he alone possessed the land.

This has rightly been rejected by the District Judge as

possession by one co-owner enures to the benefit of other co-

owners; and it is not possible for such a co-owner to put an end

3

to that possession by any secret intention in his mind; and

nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could

bring about that result.1

By the 6th issue, the appellant claimed the entire plantation. In

the facts of the case, the District Judge has given of the

plantation above 30 years old, to the plaintiff, who is entitled to

undivided share of the land; and the balance to the 2nd-5th

defendants. I see no reason to interfere with that finding.

The 7th issue is whether the plaintiff is a child of Piyasena. This

has been proved by the plaintiff inter alia by producing the

plaintiffs birth certificate marked P3 and by producing the

Decree Absolute entered in the divorce case between his parents

marked P7. The plaintiff was born during the subsistence of the

marriage of his parents. No evidence has been led by the

appellant to prove non-access or impotency on the part of the

plaintiffs father, Piyasena.2

I dismiss the appeal without costs.
