The Petitioner states that the State had issued Balayage Puncha alias

Batuwattalage Puncha Grant No. Pra/Po/10539 dated 4th June 1984, annexed

to the petition marked 'Al,l, under and in terms of Section 19{6} read with

Section 19{4} of the Land Development Ordinance, in respect of a land in

extent of 2A 1R 13P.

l'Al' has been duly registered in the Register of Permits/Grants under the Land Development Ordinance.

3

The Petitioner states that Balayage Puncha passed away on i h February 1997.

It is not in dispute that Balayage Puncha had not nominated a successor to the

said land at the time of his death. He was survived by his spouse Marappulige

Kirimallu and three of their seven children, including the Petitioner. There is

also no dispute between the parties that Kirimallu succeeded to the said land

upon the death of Balayage Puncha. The eldest son who was alive at the time

Balayage-- P-uneR-a-pass-ed-away was Battuwattalage WHso-n--+e-rnando:---=fhe ~b

Respondent in this application is the daughter of the said Wilson Fernando.

Wilson Fernando passed away on 14th July 1998, while Kirimallu passed away

on 19th September 2009.

Even prior to the death of Kirimallu, a dispute had arisen between the 4th

Respondent and the Petitioner as to who should succeed to the said land. This

Court observes that together with the other Respondents who are the

surviving children and/or grandchildren of Balayage Puncha, the Petitioner and

her children are occupying parts of the land which is the subject matter of the

said Grant.

The Petitioner states that after the death of Kirimallu, the 2nd Respondent,

Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa had issued a Declaration/ Certificate of

Succession dated 25th October 2010, annexed to the petition marked 'A3', to

the 4th Respondent declaring that she is entitled to succeed to the said land by

virtue of being the eldest daughter of the deceased Wilson Fernando, who as

noted earlier, was the eldest surviving son of Balayage Puncha, but had pre-

deceased his mother, Kirimallu.

4

The Petitioner claims that the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance

relating to the devolution of rights have not been duly followed by the 2nd

Respondent in making the decision to issue 'A3' to the 4th Respondent.

Although this Court had been informed that Statement of Objections of the 1st

- 3rd Respondents will not be filed, the learned Senior State Counsel has filed

of record a copy of the entire file maintained by the 2nd Respondent relating to

the gran-t ~Al' ;-T-h-i-s- ottrt-n-as e-xa-mtned-the Scttct record--a-n-ci- tt-appecrrs-to this

Court that the 2nd Respondent had not conducted a formal inquiry to

determine the successor, prior to issuing 'A3'.

Be that as it may, it is in the above factual background that the Petitioner has

invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter alia the following relief

from this Court:

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Declaration/ Certificate of Succession

dated 25th October 2010, marked 'A3';

2. A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to perform

its lawful obligations under the Land Development Ordinance;

3. A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to hold an

appropriate inquiry to determine the rightful successor to the land

morefully described in the Grant marked 'Al'.

The issue that arises for determination in this application is what should 'be the

date on which succession should take place where no successor has been

nominated in respect of a grant. It is the contention of the Petitioner that

5

where no nomination has been made in respect of the holding in question, and

the spouse of the owner of the holding succeeds to the said land upon the

death of the owner, the procedure for succession is triggered only after the

death of the spouse who successfully succeeded to the said land, and that

succession according to the Third Schedule could take place only thereafter. In

contr-ast to the said position of the Petitioner, the position taken up by the 4th

Respondent is- -t-hat wAefe-n0-rte-mina-t-~A-A-as -beeA--mael-e- by tAe owner of the

holding, the process for succession in terms of Rule 1 of the Third Schedule is

triggered at the time of death of the said owner and that succession is deemed

to have taken place soon after the death of the owner, but subject to the rights

of the surviving spouse who is the life interest holder.

The determination of this application requires a discussion of the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 and the amendments made

thereto, in particular by the Land Development (Amendment) Act No. 16 of

1969, relating to succession under a grant.

This Court would first examine the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance, as it stood prior to the amendment in 1969. The starting point is

Section 49 of the Land Development Ordinance, which empowered the owner

of a holding to nominate a person to succeed him on his death. Section 51

provided that the person so nominated by the owner should belong to one of

the groups of relatives enumerated in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule. Where a

valid nomination had been effected and in the absence of a life holder, the

successor was required by Section 70 to succeed to the holding, upon the

death of the owner. In terms of Section 68(2), a nominated successor fails to

succeed inter alia if he refuses to succeed or if he does not enter into

6

possession of the holding within a period of six months from the death of the

owner of the holding. However, if a successor had not been nominated, or

where the nominated successor failed to succeed, Section 71 provided that

title shall devolve as prescribed by the rules of the Third Schedule. In terms of

Section 73{2}, "title to a holding shall be deemed to have devolved on any

person-Sti~ceeding under the provisions of Section 72 as from the date of the -_

- __ dea-tA-G-f-the-Hfe-=-ho1der of the holding to which such peron so suC-eeEisc."~

Several important amendments were introduced by the aforementioned

Amendment Act No. 16 of 1969. The first such amendment was the

introduction of Section 48B by which the spouse of the owner of the holding

was automatically entitled to succeed to the holding upon the death of the

owner. Section 48B{1} provided that "upon the the death of the owner of a

holding, the spouse of that owner shall be entitled to succeed to that holding"

subject to the conditions specified therein.3

It is not in dispute that Kirimallu, the spouse of Balayage Puncha, exercised the

right given under Section 48B{1} and succeeded to the said holding upon the

death of Balayage Puncha.

2 Section 72(2) is identical to Section 71.

3 The conditions are as follows:

(a) upon the marriage of such spouse, title to the holding shall devolve on the nominated successor of the deceased owner or, if there was no such nomination, on the person who was entitled to succ,eed under rule 1 of the Third Schedule; (b) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of that holding; (c) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that holding;

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a spouse who has been nominated by the deceased owner of the holding to succeed to that holding.

7

Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance sets out inter alia as to who

should succeed where a nomination has not been made. The relevant portions

of Section 72 are re-produced below:4

"If no successor has been nominated, .... the title .... to the holding of an

owner shall upon th~~eath of such ... owner ... wh~re ~u~h ... owner died

lea\ling-dl!hb~her-5PQll5eF ~~ upon th~deatb of sucb-- SP-OU5e,-

devolve as prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule."s

It is the view of this Court that in terms of Section 72, devolution of title in

terms of Rule 1 of the Third Schedule shall take place only upon the death of

the spouse who has succeeded to the land, and more importantly not upon the

death of the owner of the holding.

4 Section 72 also applies where the nominated successor has failed to succeed.

s Rule 1 of the Third Schedule reads as follows:

(a) The groups of relatives from which a successor may be nominated for the purposes of section 51 shall be as set out in the subjoined table.

(b) Title to a holding for the purposes of section 72 shall devolve on one only of the relatives of the permit-holder or owner in the order of priority in which they are respectively mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred to the younger where there are more relatives than one in any group. Table

(i) Sons (ii) Daughters (iii) Grandsons (iv) Granddaughters (v) Father (vi) Mother (vii) Brothers (viii) Sisters (ix) Uncles (x) Aunts (xi) Nephews (xii) Nieces

In this rule, "relative" means a relative by blood and not by marriage.

8

This point is further buttressed by the amendment made to Section 73 of the

Land Development Ordinance,6 the relevant portions of which are re-produced

below:

"Title to .... the holding shall be deemed to have devolved on any person

entitled to succeed to !he land orJlOldingJ!Dder th~~TovisLol'}~_ of section

72 as ttGm::t~tl:te:-4eata:atth~. owner- of4l'le-l'lold ir:lg ()f-=if sud~

.... owner died .... leaving behind his or her spouse, .... from the date of

the death of such spouse, as the case may be."

It is the view of this Court that Section 73 leaves no doubt that succession shall

take place from the date of the death of Kirimallu.

The next important amendment was the introduction of the following new

definition of the word, 'successor' in Section 487:

"In this Chapter "successor", when used with reference to any land

alienated on a .... holding, means a person who is entitled under this

Chapter to succeed to that .... holding upon the death of the .... owner

thereof, if that .... owner died without leaving behind his or her spouse,

or, if that .... owner died leaving behind his or her spouse, upon the

failure of that spouse to succeed to that land or holding or upon the

death of that spouse."

6 Section 73 has been repealed by Act No 16 of 1969 and a new Section 73 has been substituted therefor. The marginal note of Section 73 reads as, 'date of succession'. 7 The reference to a 'permit' and a 'permit holder' have been omitted when re-producing the definition.

9

In terms of this definition, since Kirimallu has succeeded to the holding, the

entitlement to succession among the relatives of Balayage Puncha is triggered

upon the death of Kirimallu. Thus, the view of this Court that succession should

take place not when Balayage Puncha passed away but on the passing away of

Kirimallu is supported by the above definition.

This positiort--i--ooafirmei b:y~etio [k49c-Q the Land De\JeIQpme nt-Ol"d~natlee

which deals with succession by a nominee of the owner of the holding. The

relevant parts of Section 49 are re-produced below:

"Upon the death of .... an owner of a holding .... where such ... owner died

leaving behind his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to

succeed to the land alienated .... or upon the death of such spouse, a

person nominated as successor by such .... owner shall succeed to that

land or holding."

Although Section 49 will not have any application as Balayage Puncha had not

nominated a successor, had there been a nominated successor, such person

was required to succeed to the land six months from the death of the spouse.8

Section 49 clearly establishes that had there been a nominated successor, the

right of the successor to succeed to the land will only arise at the time of the

death of the spouse, and not prior to that.

The learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent referred to the use of the word,

'was' in condition (a) of Section 48B(1)(a),9 as supporting his argument that

8 See Section 68(2)(ii) of the Land Development Ordinance. 9 Su pra.

10

succession shall take place among the heirs who were living at the time of the

death of the owner. While there is some merit in the said argument, this Court

observes that the said condition applies only where the spouse re-marries in

which case, the spouse would not be entitled to succeed in terms of Section

48B{1}. Upon re-marrying, all the other provisions which refer to the spouse

who has succeeded to the bolding will not apply. In a~ny _eye_~!, _th ~s is the only

~place in the:- -1an~l:Jlffient ~Gina9:e~ where arL interprtatiarLa_

suggested by the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent is possible, whereas

all other provisions which have been referred to earlier point in the opposite

direction.

The learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent has cited the judgment of this

Court in Samarasena vs Panditharatne10 in support of his argument that

succession takes place upon the death of the owner of the holding. The facts of

that case very briefly are as follows. The Petitioner is the son of Muttiah to

whom a grant had been issued by the State. Muttiah died in 1983 while his

wife Kaluarachchi also died in the same year. Piyasena was the eldest son of

Muttiah. Piyasena passed away in 1996, and the 10th Respondent who is the

son of Piyasena was recognised as the successor. The Petitioner complained

that this decision is wrong. This Court disagreed and disallowed the

application.ll It is observed that in the said case, both Muttiah and his spouse

had passed away prior to the death of the eldest son and hence, applying the

Third Schedule, the successor should be the 10th Respondent. The facts in the

present application are clearly different to Samarasena's case, as in this case,

the eldest surviving son pre-deceased the spouse, and succession as r::>er the

10 CA (Writ) Application No. 239/2010; CA Minutes of 20th September 2012.

11 The Supreme Court refused to grant special leave to appeal - vide SC Special Leave to Appeal Application

No. 232/2012; SC Minutes of 13

th February 2013 .

11

Third Schedule would only be triggered upon the death of the spouse,

Kirimallu.

Taking into consideration the above provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance, the view of this Court is as follows. At the time Balayage Puncha

passed away in 1997, the eldest livi~g _s_on .wi!~9n Fernando was eligible to _

s u ccee d Ul.::.th ec--a~Q--t:H~lJdi:ag .. __ 1cl owa'lle.(,.-aS:.-b is rnotl'l e r -K i r ~ma~1 u ,~whO-~S--the

spouse of Balayage Puncha was still alive, and as she exercised her right to

succeed, the scheme of devolution set out in Section 72 did not get triggered

and therefore no rights accrued in favour of Wilson Fernando upon the death

of Balayage Puncha. The process of devolution set out in Section 72 can only

take place upon the death of Kirimallu. By the time Kirimallu passed away in

September 2009, Wilson Fernando had already passed away. Rule 1 of the

Third Schedule is triggered only at this stage and priority would be given to the

surviving children of Balayage Puncha. The grandchildren of Balayage Puncha

including the children of Wilson Fernando would be entitled to succeed only if

the surviving children of Balayage Puncha did not succeed.

In these circumstances, this Court holds that the decision of the 1st -3rd

Respondents to issue the certificate of heirship to the 4th Respondents is a

misapplication of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance and is

bad in law. It is a decision which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance and therefore the said decision is liable to be quashed

by a Writ of Certiorari. As the Petitioner is not the eldest of the surviving

children, the 1st Respondent will have to take steps in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance to determine the lawful successor to the said land.

12

This Court must observe at this stage that even though a Statement of

Objections was not filed on behalf of the 1st -3rd Respondents, the learned

Senior State Counsel, in the written submissions tendered to this Court has

quite correctly stated as follows:

"Therefo!e, the point 9f time thC!t needs to be considered in order- to

ascertam thec ,-llteSLQO_ in ,,-espect~of tAe - fac-ts a-ppliae-~e - -te-this -

application is "the time of the death of the spouse of the grant holder". In

such a situation, at the time of the death of the spouse, the living person

who comes on top of the hierarchy as set out in the schedule to LDO gets

the succession."

This Court observes from the record submitted by the learned Senior State

Counsel that, acting on a complaint made by the Peti!ioner to the Presidential

Secretariat, the Provincial Land Commissioner of the North Central Province,

having called for observations from the 2nd Respondent, had advised the 2nd

Respondent as follows: 12

"~eD)oQ) QBlrn ~@ (ftB~, ~l: ~J ~& em t:l)>@~Q) SQQ><!esS

Q)l:ei)l:O~ t:l)C)~ tDO Cfl:oSeD, ~ &:>l:C~ tnoC) ~ mesSeS <!@C)aS t;.~S

(!t;.S."

This Court observes further that the 2nd Respondent had totally disregarded

the said advice and insisted that his decision 'A3' is right. 13 However, by a

12 Letter dated 18

th June 2012.

13 Letter dated 11th March 2013.

13

further letter dated 26th July 2014, the 2nd Respondent had conceded that his

decision is wrong,14 but no steps have been taken by the 1st - 3rd Respondents

to rectify this error.

During the course of the argument as well as in the written submissions, the

lea riled Couns~lJor the 4th Resp~ndent submitted that the Petitioner is not

~ - entl1led to the re~icef prae4:tu~F--oJ) the following grounds. -

1. The Petitioner is guilty of laches.

2. The Petitioner is guilty of suppression and/or misrepresentation of

material facts.

3. The Petitioner has no locus standi to make the application.

4. A Writ of Mandamus cannot be issued against a person named in his

official capacity.

This Court would like to very briefly address each of the said objections.

This Court observes that the certificate of heirship had been issued in favour of

the 4th Respondent on 25th October 2010, whereas this application has been

filed on 26th April 2013. This Court has time and again held that a litigant must

invoke the jurisdiction of this Court without delay and that this Court, which is

14 <i @e:l~ ~@@ ceD ff~ O~ ~ ~~ COG CllC~ ~e\lJ CD~ ~C:!i ~Cl@ oa~ ~ae~ CllC~~ ~tl)~ CllC CD~ ~~ Q~ ~tolS al ~ ~ ~ ~a5 ~eD@

14

exercising a discretionary jurisdiction can refuse to grant relief, especially

where there has not been an explanation for the delay.

This Court observes that the Petitioner has not explained the delay in filing this

application. However, as observed earlier, a perusal of the record maintained

b~Y-lhe 2nd Respondent reve_als that the Petitioner and the-4th Respor:ldent~t-las

- __ ----=-h-a= d-=:a dtspute-w~ttl re-garo--te t-tle ~and--eveA~~rior to the death o-f--Kirifl'Ta-llu--;-l-he_

said dispute had continued after her death. Furthermore, a formal inquiry had

not been held by the 2nd Respondent prior to the issuance of 'A3'. However,

the letter dated 2ih April 2011 sent by the 2nd Respondent to the 1st

Respondent, letter dated 25th April 2012 sent by the Petitioner to the 2nd

Respondent, letter dated 18th May 2012 sent to the Petitioner by the

Presidential Secretariat and letter dated 28th May 2012 sent by the Petitioner

to the 1st Respondent, establishes that the Petitioner did in fact agitate the

issue of succession even after I A3' was issued, before the proper

administrative forum. The Petitioner's delay can thus be excused to some

extent.

The question that this Court must now consider is whether this Court should

shut its eyes to the injustice that would follow if this Court refuses to grant

relief to the Petitioner inspite of the decision of the 2nd Respondent being

illegal, or whether the relief prayed for should be granted, notwithstanding the

delay and the failure of the Petitioner to explain the delay.

15

In this regard, this Court would like to refer to the decision of the Supreme

Court in Biso Menika vs Cyril de Alwis and others15 where it was held as

follows:

"When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

_ complained of is manifestly erroneou_~ or withqut jurisdiction J!le Court

-would be 10atheJ:Q allow the mis_chieLof the Order to continu~eJed --------

the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very

extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority

concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court

may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party

shows that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such

event, the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically .

... Unlike in English Law, in our Law there is no statutory time limit within

which a petition for the issue of a Writ must be filed. But a rule of practice

has grown which insists upon such petition being made without undue

delay. When no time limit is specified for seeking such remedy, the Court

has ample power to condone delays, where denial of Writ to the

petitioner is likely to cause great injustice. The Court may therefore in its

discretion entertain the application in spite of the fact that a petitioner

comes to Court late, especially where the Order challenged is a nullity for

absolute want of jurisdiction in the authority making the order."

15 1982 (1) Sri LR 368 at 379-380.

16

The approach that should be adopted by this Court when considering an

objection with regard to delay has been discussed in V. Ramasamy v. Ceylon

State Mortgage Bank and Others,16 where the Supreme Court held as follows:

"The principles of laches have not been applied automatically or

_arbitrarily or in a technJcal manner by Courts of Eq~ity )hemselves. The

- 1?-6vy (oun il iQ the kase of The Lindsay Petroleum Company vs. I:lurd/- -

1874 Law Reports, Vol V P.C 221 at 239, stated in the clearest terms the

manner in which the Courts of Equity have applied this doctrine:17

"the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical

doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either

because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be

regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and

neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the

other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him

if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases,

lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an

argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon

mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of

limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles

substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such

cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during

the interval, wh ich might affect either party and cause a balance of justice

16 78 NLR 510. Followed in Rajakaruna vs R.J.Oe Mel, Minister of Finance [1985 (1) Sri LR 391] and Bogawantalawa Plantations vs Minister of Public Administration and Plantation Affairs and others [2004 (2) Sri

LR 329] .

17 ibid; page 514.

17

or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the

remedy."

Finally, it is my view that where we are dealing with a matter concerning

the extent of the powers and jurisdiction, which is reposed in us, to be

exercis_ed for the public good, we should hesitate to fE~tter ours~v~ witt}

arnitraJ:Y rul~s ,_ untess suctla course QLactLon is_absolutely ne~~sary ._1he -_

principles of laches must, in my view be applied carefully and

discriminatingly and not automatically and as a mere mechanical

device." l 8

Co_nsidering the fact that the impugned decision of the 2nd Respondent is

illegal, and the fact that it has now been recognized by the State that it has

made a mistake, an injustice would be caused to the Petitioner by a refusal of

this application. Hence, this Court is inclined to follow the above decisions of

the Supreme Court. This Court is therefore of the view that this is a fit case

where the discretion vested in this Court should be exercised in favour of the

Petitioner. In doing so, this Court is also mindful of the fact that the 5th - 10th

Respondents are resident on this land, a fact which has been admitted by the

4th Respondent.l9 In these circumstances, this Court overrules the first

objection raised by the learned Counsel for the 4 th Respondent.

The next objection raised by the learned Counsel for the 4 th Respondent is that

the Petitioner has suppressed the fact that the 2nd Respondent conducted an

inquiry prior to arriving at her decision. A perusal of the record submitted by

18 Ibid; page 517 .

19 Paragraph 3 of th ~ petition has been admitted in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Objections of the 4th Respondent.

18

the learned Senior State Counsel does not indicate that a formal inquiry had

been held prior to the issuance of 'A3', and to that extent, there does not

appear to be any suppression. Be that as it may, it has been consistently held

by our Courts that suppression and misrepresentation of material facts by a

petitioner who seeks a discretionary remedy of this Court would disentitle

sucB person to such relief. Ijowever, what is important ~s that the suppressio!,

must -r-eta-te to_ a JacL which is material to the complaint raised by_ sucl"l -

petitioner. This Court has examined the petition and observes that the

Petitioner is not complaining that she was not afforded a hearing or that the

2nd Respondent arrived at a decision disregarding the principles of natural

justice. As observed earlier, the complaint of the Petitioner is that the decision

of the 2nd Respondent is illegal. In these circumstances, even if an inquiry was

held, this Court does not agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for

the 4th Respondent that the failure to disclose the fact that an 'inquiry' was

held, tantamount to a suppression of a material fact.

The third objection raised by the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent is that

the Petitioner does not have the locus standi to have and maintain this

application in view of the fact that the Petitioner is not the eldest of the

surviving children of Balayage Puncha. Although such fact is not in dispute, this

Court must observe that the Petitioner is in fact eligible in terms of Rule 1 of

the Third Schedule of the Land Development Ordinance to succeed to the said

holding, in the event the other siblings refuse to succeed. As illustrated above,

the entitlement of the Petitioner takes priority to the entitlement of the 4th

Respondent, thus giving the Petitioner the locus to institute this action ..

19

This Court also observes that the Petitioner has in fact named his siblings as

well as some of their children who are occupying the said land as Respondents

to this application, thus demonstrating that the Petitioner is not seeking to

gain an unfair advantage over the others. Furthermore, the Petitioner is not

seeking an order from this Court that she be regarded as the successor. For

these reasons, th!s Court d~es not see any merit in the third objection qf Jhe ~

Ie-ar-neg-Geunsel fo"r !~4~ Respondent.

The final objection of the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent is that a Writ

of Mandamus cannot be issued against a person named in his official capacity.

The Petitioner has named the 'Land Commissioner General' as the 1st

Respondent and the Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa as the 2nd

Respondent but has not named the holders of the offices. The question is

whether the failure to do so is fatal, and whether this Court cannot issue a Writ

of Mandamus in such a situation. This Court does not think so, for three

reasons.

The first is that such a course of action is provided for in Rule 5 of the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 which reads as follows:

"(1) This rule shall apply to applications under Articles 140 and 141 of the

Constitution, in which a public officer has been made a respondent

in his official capacity, (whether on account of an act or omission in

such official capacity, or to obtain relief against him in such capacity,

or otherwise).

20

(2) A public officer may be made a respondent to any such application

by reference to his official designation only (and not by name), and it

shall accordingly be sufficient to describe such public officer in the

caption by reference to his official designation or the office held by

him, omitting reference to his name. If a respondent cannot be

sufficiently identified in the manner, it sh911 be sufficient if his name

::-is disclosed in the av~rm~nts in th_e petition.

(3) No such application shall be dismissed on account of any omission,

defect or irregularity in regard to the name, designation, description,

or address of such respondent, if the Court is satisfied that such

respondent has been sufficiently identified and described, and has

not been misled or prejudiced by such omission, defect or

irregularity. The Court may make such order as it thinks fit in the

interests of justice, for amendment of pleadings, fresh or further

notice, costs, or otherwise, in respect of any such omission, defect or

irregularity.

(4) (a) In respect of an act or omission done in official capacity by a

public officer who has thereafter ceased to hold such office, such

application may be made and proceeded with against his successor,

for the time being, in such office, such successor being made a

respondent, by reference to his official designation only, in terms of

sub rule (2)

(b) If such an application has been made against a public officer, who

has been made a respondent by reference to his official designation

21

(and not by name), in respect of an act or omission in his official

capacity, and such public officer ceases to hold such office, during

the pendency of such application, such application may be

proceeded with against his successor, for the time being, in such

office, without any addition or substitution of respondent afresh,

proxy, or the issue of any notice, unless the Court _ consid~rs sl!ch

~g~ion, su~ti~utjo[ll- proxy- Qr [lotice __ to ~e nece~5ary in the--

interests of justice. Such successor will be bound, in his official

capacity, by any order made, or direction given, by the Court against,

or in respect of, such original respondent.

(c) Where such an application has been made against a public officer,

who has been made a respondent by reference to his official

designation (and not by name), and such public officer ceases to hold

such office after the final determination of such application, but

before complying with the order made or direction given therein, his

successor, for the time being, in such office will be bound by and

shall comply with, such order or direction./I

The Rules of this Court therefore makes it very clear that a person can be

named as Respondent by reference to his official designation only and that it is

not imperative to refer to such person by name.

The second reason why this Court does not see any merit in the said objection

is that there are jud icial pronouncements that take a contrary view. This issue

has been discussed extensively in the recent judgment of this Court in

Methodist Trust Association of Ceylon vs Divisional Director of Education of

22

1

Galle20 where it was held that a Writ of Mandamus can be issued on a juristic

person as well on a public official identified by his or her official designation.

The third reason is that, the 1st and 2nd Respondents have appeared before this

Court, have filed their proxies and have been represented by the Hon.

Attorney General. They have clearly submitted themselves to the jurisdiction

of thi-s (~.<?urt,-have not. t~_~en. an.y objection _wi!h regarl.J:0 them net having

been referred to by name and more importantly, by motion dated 1 ih March

2014 have informed this Court that they shall abide by any decision of this

Court. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the final objection

raised by the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent cannot be sustained.

In the above circumstances, this Court proceeds to issue the Writ of Certiorari

prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition to quash the

certificate of succession marked 'A3'. This Court also issues the Writs of

Mandamus prayed for in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the prayer to the petition,

directing the 1st and 2nd Respondents to hold an appropriate inquiry to

determine the person entitled to succeed to the said land and to take steps

thereafter in terms of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. This

Court does not make any order with regard to costs.
