Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a limited liability company duly incorporated in Sri Lanka under the company

laws and is an associate of McCallum Breweries (Ceylon) Ltd.

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash letter dated 04.03.2008 (P9) by which the

1st Respondent sought to recover interest from the Petitioner in terms of Rule (2) in the Schedule

to the Excise Notification No. 744 (P3) on the outstanding excise duty.

Futility

The gravamen of the case of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent is seeking to recover penal

interest due on the outstanding excise duty which is inter alia ultra vires the Excise Ordinance,

without jurisdiction/in excess of jurisdiction, which cannot be charged by delegated legislation in

view of Article 148 of the Constitution.

The learned DSG submitted that Rule 2 of Excise Notification No. 744 (P3) made by the Minister

of Finance on 13.08.1985 stipulates that an interest of 3% per month is liable to be paid on excise

duty not paid on time. Therefore, a preliminary objection was raised that the Petitioner cannot

maintain this application without a prayer to quash P3 as P9 is only a letter setting out the details

requested by the Petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner responded that as P3 is a nullity, there is no

need for it to be set aside or in the alternative the Petitioner is entitled in these proceedings to

attack P3 collaterally. On the question of nullity, he relied on two judgments of this Court in

Ashokan v. Commissioner of National Housing [(2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 179] and Leelawathie and Another

v. Commissioner of National Housing [(2004) 3 Sri.L.R. 175] where Sripavan J. quotes with

approval Lord Denning in Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172] where

he said "You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there, it will collapse".

However, in Ashokan v. Commissioner of National Housing (supra) the Petitioner specifically

sought a quashing of A9 which was the decision that was held to be a nUllity. In Leelawathie and

Another v. Commissioner of National Housing (supra) Sripavan J. was not confronted with a

situation of futility arising from the absence of any relief sought against a decision that was a

nUllity.

It is apposite to briefly set out at this point the meaning of nullity in Administrative Law. Clive

Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed., South Asia Edition (2017) in discussing the meaning

of null and void in Administrative Law states (page 185):

"The primary concern here is the meaning of nullity or voidness solely in the context of

the remedies granted by courts. The concept of nullity has been used to solve other

problem arising in administrative law. For remedial purposes, the orthodox view is that

an ultra vires act is regarded as void and a nUllity. An act by a public authority which lacks

legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its illegality is

established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will be regarded

as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it will be regarded

as ever incapable of ever producing legal effects." (emphasis added)

Thus, even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes

the illegality must be established before a court. As stated by Wade and Forsyth, Administrative

Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 281:

"".the court will treat an administrative act or order invalid only if the right remedy is

sought by the right person in the right proceedings"

Prior to Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd.(supra), this approach was reflected in the statement of

Lord Radcliffe in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-770] where he

held:

"An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. It

bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead . Unless the necessary proceedings are

taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset,

it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders."

In fact, Wade and Forsyth (supra page 305), states that the statement of Lord Denning in Mcfoy

v. United Africo Co. Ltd.(supra) relied on by the Petitioner is not the correct position in law.

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, (supra) page 304, after restating the above statement of

Lord Radcliffe sets out the correct position as follows:

"This must be equally true even where the 'brand of invalidity' is plainly visible for there

also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the decision of the court.

The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out repeatedly in the House of

Lords and Privy Council, without distinction between patent and latent defects. Lord

Diplock spoke still more clearly [F Hoffmann-La Roch and C AG v. Secretary far Trade and

Industry (1975) AC 295 at 366], saying that

It leads to confusion to use such terms as 'voidable', 'voidable ab initio', 'void' or 'a nullity'

as descriptive of the status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra vires for patent

or for latent defects, before its validity has been pronounced on by a court of competent

jurisdiction." (emphasis added)

This approach is consistent with the 'presumption of validity' according to which administrative

action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a court [F Hoffmann-La Roche and

Co. A G v. Secretory of Stote for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295J. However, this 'presumption

of validity' exists pending a final decision by the court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92

at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transpart Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at 156

and 161, and 173-4J.

This presumption applies to subordinate legislation as well. It is in this context that Lord Irvine LC

in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 held:

"The Anisminic decision established, contrary to previous thinking that there might be

error of law within jurisdiction, that there was a single category of errors of law, all of

which rendered decision ultra vires. No distinction is to be drawn between a patent (or

substantive) error of law or a latent (procedural) error of law. An ultra vires act or

subordinate legislation is unlawful simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its

legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction, is of no legal

effect whatsoever."

Accordingly, I reject the proposition of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that as

P3 is a nullity, there is no need for it to be set aside. Even if P3 is a nullity as alleged by the

Petitioner, the 'presumption of validity' applies and it is to be considered as valid until and unless

its legality is successfully challenged in appropriate proceedings.

In this context, what is meant by appropriate proceedings needs to be elaborated. An ultra vires

administrative act can be challenged in two ways, Firstly, it can be challenged directly where for

example a writ of certiorari can be sought to quash the illegal decision. Secondly, it can be

challenged collaterally for example by way of defence to a criminal charge.

The Petitioner relies on the following extract from Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law,

4th ed., Sweet and Maxwell, 2011, page 206:

"Collateral challenges arise when the invalidity is raised in the course of some other

proceedings, the purpose of which is not to establish invalidity where questions of validity

become relevant".

In this application, the Petitioner is alleging that the demand for penal interest on the outstanding

excise duty is ultra vires. That is the core of its case. The Petitioner has annexed to its petition

the relevant Gazette (P3) on which the claim for penal interest is based but has not sought a

quashing of the relevant part. In that context the Petitioner is not making a collateral challenge

on P3 since P3 is the core of the Petitioner's case. An issue is not collateral if it is the central issue

to be decided [Wandsworth LBC v. Winder (1985) AC 461J.

Accordingly, I reject the position of the Petitioner that he is entitled to collaterally attack P3 in

these proceedings.

In any event, in Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National Housing Development Authority and

Others [C.A. Application No. 866/98, CAM. 08.03.2004J Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that

the court will not set aside a document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express

language in the prayer to the petition. The Petitioner has failed to pray for any relief against P3.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the application of the Petitioner is futile and dismiss the

application with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
