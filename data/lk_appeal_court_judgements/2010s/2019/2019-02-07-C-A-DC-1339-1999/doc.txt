DEFENDANTS-RESPONDENTS

M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) filed the above

styled case bearing No. 12920/L in the District Court of Galle against the

Defendants-Respondents seeking inter alia,

a. a declaration that the Deed of transfer No. 3008 dated 15th January 1981 is

subject to a constructive trust;

b. that the properties described in the schedule to the plaint are held on trust

by the 1st Defendant-Respondent in this case in favour of the heirs of Hinni

Appuhamy Maitipe;

c. that an order be made for the 1st Defendant-Respondent to accept Rs. 7000/-

with interest and transfer the properties mentioned in the said deed to the

heirs of Hinni Appuhamy Maitipe, and if he fails to do so, an order be made

to the Registrar of the District Court to effect such transfer; and

d. for a declaration that the Deeds attested after the said Deed No. 3008 dealt

in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the plaint be declared null and void.

The Appellant and the Defendant-Respondents are siblings; 3rd Defendant-

Respondent is the mother of all the Parties of the case.

Though the case has been filed against the 1st Defendant-Respondent, he was

absent and unrepresented and further had not filed any answer in this case since

the case fixed ex parte against him.

The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes collectively

referred to as the Respondents) by their joint answer dated 18th October 1995,

have specifically denied that the Deed No. 3008 (P3) is subjected to any trust and

7

sought a dismissal of the Appellants action. Whilst the 10th Defendant-

Respondent by filing his answer on or about 18th October 1995 admitted the plaint

of the Appellant.

At the trial, 21 issues were raised on behalf of the Appellant and 3 issues were

raised on behalf of the Respondents.

The Appellant commenced giving evidence on 17th February 1998, after the

conclusion of his evidence, the mortgagee/vendee of the Deed No. 3008,

Nanayakkara Badungodage Samaparapala gave evidence on behalf of the

Appellant. Whereas the 2nd Defendant-Respondent gave evidence on behalf of the

respondents and she was the only one who gave evidence on behalf the

Respondents.

After conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Galle by his judgment

dated 07th September 1999 (vide page 171 of the appeal brief) dismissed the

Appellants action.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant has preferred this appeal to

set aside the judgment and for the relives set out in the plaint.

According to the Appellant, when he explains the circumstances leading to the

filling of this action can briefly as follows:

Due to certain financial difficulties his father Hinni Appuhamy had mortgaged

(conveyed) the property which he purchased by Deed No. 893 (P1) more fully

described in the schedule to the plaint to one Bandungodage Samaparapala who is

a friend of him for only Rs. 3000/- by Deed No. 1118 (P2).

8

According to the Appellant, in the said Deed there was a condition that the

Appellants father shall repay the value of the Deed with interest within a year in

order to reclaim the property. Therefore, the Appellant is in a position that the said

Samaparapala held the property on trust until the Appellants father reclaimed the

said property over years.

The Appellant stated that on 15.01.1981, the 1st Defendant-Respondent on the

request of the father reclaimed the said property only for Rs. 5000/- on behalf of

the family by virtue of Deed No. 3008 dated 15.01.1981, therefore, the appellant

further taken up a position that the intention of the parties was to held the property

worth of over Rs. 500,000/- on trust for the family and the father who was the

original owner of the property.

He further stated that later after the death of the father, the 1st Defendant-

Respondent had transferred the said property among the family members in breach

of said constructive trust. Its further noted that the 1st Defendant-Respondent

conveyed the property to the 2nd Respondent by virtue of Deed No. 648 dated

13.08.1990 who is the eldest sister of the family and she divided and sold the

property as per her intentions. The Appellant also stated that even though the

market value of the property in 1981 was over Rs. 500,000/- the 1st Defendant-

Respondent was able to reclaim said property for such lower price was due to the

constructive trust and the consent of the father. Therefore, the Appellant also

argued that if the mortgagee Samarapala wanted to sell this property he should

have sold it for the market value.

In contrast, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent submitted that the said Samarapala has

not been holding the said property as a trust in favour of Hinni Appuhamy due to

the fact the time period specified in the said deed which has been exceeded, Hinni

Appuhamy had become no longer the owner of the property. They further

9

submitted that when there was a conditional transfer there would be no

constructive trust after the lapse of fixed term as there was no contract to

retransfer. Therefore, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent is in a position that there

should be an existing contract for Section 93 of the Trusts Ordinance to operate,

but in this case, there was no existing contract, as there was no demand or action

brought for retransfer this property because, the right to retransfer has lapsed.

Having heard the both parties submissions, the pivotal issue in this case is

whether the said (transactions) Deeds Nos. 1118 (P2) and 3008 (P3) were

subjected to a constructive trust or whether they were absolute transfers.

To ascertain whether the Appellant was successful in establishing the necessary

ingredients to prove a constructive trust, a careful attention on Section 83 of the

Trusts Ordinance is important.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance reads thus:

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it

cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant

circumstances that he intended to dispose of the beneficial interest

therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such properly for the

benefit of the owner or his legal representative.

It is the burden of the person who claims or tries to prove the cover under the

above Section 83 to establish that he/she (any person) did not intend to dispose of

the beneficial interest of the property transferred by the deed, put in suit. Section

83 referred to above, permits Court to infer such decision upon considering the

attendant circumstances that led to the execution of the deed. This accustomed

10

position in law had been discussed in many cases in the apex Courts. (See:

Muttammah Vs. Thiyagarajah [(1960) 62 NLR 559], Piyasena Vs. Vansue

[(1997) 2 SLR 311], and Thisa Nona And Three Others Vs. Premedasa [(1997) 2

SLR 169]

In Muttammah Vs. Thiyagarajah (supra), it was held that,

Attendant Circumstances are to my mind circumstances which

precede or follow the transfer but are not too far removed in point'

of time to be regarded as attendant which expression in this context

may be understood as accompanying" or "connected with". Whether

a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on the facts of-each

case (Page at 564)

In Piyasena Vs. Vansue (supra), it was held that:

(1) Even though a transfer is in the form of an outright sale it is

possible to lead parole evidence to show that facts exist from which

it could be inferred that the real transaction was either-

(i) money lending, where the land is transferred as a security as in

this case or;

(ii) a transfer in trust-in such cases section 83 would apply.

(2) A trust is inferred from attendant circumstances. The trust is an

obligation imposed by law on those who try to camouflage the actual

nature of a transaction. When the attendant circumstances point to a

11

loan transaction and not a genuine sale transaction the provisions of

section 83 of the Trust Ordinance apply.

(3) The behaviour of the plaintiff-appellant with Samagi Mudalali

in the background and the defendant-appellant just before and after

the signing of P2 and P3 and even after the end of the period of

lease, show them to be that of rapacious investors and persecuted

borrower respectively rather than a genuine purchaser and a over

holding tenant.

(iii) It cannot be reasonably be inferred consistently with the

attendant circumstances that the defendant-appellant intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest to the property in question.

Further, an important view was taken by the Supreme Court in the case of

Dayawathie And Other Vs. Sgunasekera & Another [(1991) 1SLR 115], where it

was held that Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, No. 14 of 1895 as amended

does not bar parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and that the transferor

did not intend to pass the beneficial interest in property.

Accordingly, Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance allows taking attendant

circumstances into account, which, if credible, may establish the existence of a

constructive trust.

However, as regard the issue that consideration for the transfer was paid by the 1st

Defendant to Samarapala at the interest of Hinni Appuhamy, when giving

reference to Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance, it was argued by the Defendants-

Respondents that the provisions of the Trusts Ordinance are not applicable to a

situation of this nature.

12

Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance reads thus:

Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration

paid or provided by another person, and it appears that such other

person did not intend to pay or provide such consideration for the

benefit of the transferee, the transferee must hold the property for

the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration.

Counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent was submitted that, in order to establish

a constructive trust in terms of the above section, the law requires to prove that the

consideration mentioned in the deed in question had been paid or provided by a

person other than the original transfer in a deed of transfer and also that other

person who paid the consideration did not intend to give the beneficial interest to

the transferee of the property subjected to in that deed. When such circumstances

are established then it is that other person who paid or provided the consideration

has the right to claim that the person who provided the money and not to the Hinni

Appuhamy or his children.

Further, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent brought an interesting fact that in any event

the Appellant who was only 4 years old at the time of the conditional transfer was

made and he was not able or not in a position to lead evidence, that there were

attendant circumstances to the alleged trust.

It was in those circumstances, the learned District Judge has reached a conclusion

that the Appellant has failed to indicate the attendant circumstances in his plaint to

prove that there is a trust in favour of Hinni Appuhamy and his heirs.

Therefore, the learned District Judge has correctly held that the Samarapala has

obtained good title to the land by land by Deed of Transfer No. 1118 executed for

13

valuable consideration and has transferred the clear title of the said property since

he was an absolute owner of the said property. And, he did not hold the property

on trust since time period specified in the said deed has been exceeded.

In all the circumstances of this case, this Court in a view that the Appellant has

failed to show a proper case to interfere with the judgment of the learned District

Judge. Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the judgment.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
