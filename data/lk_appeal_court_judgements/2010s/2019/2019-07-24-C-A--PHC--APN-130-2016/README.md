Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

These proceedings were instituted by the police under section

66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Magistrates

Court naming two parties over a dispute relating to a building.

Later another party intervened. After inquiry the learned

Magistrate held with the 2nd party in terms of section 68(1) on

the basis that it is the 2nd party who was in possession of the

building at the date of filing the first information in Court. The

learned Magistrate further held that the 1st party did not prove

that he was forcibly dispossessed by the 2nd party within two

months prior to the filing of the first information. The learned

Magistrate took the view that the 1st party was never in

possession of the building. This order of the learned Magistrate

has been upheld by the High Court in revision. It is against that

Judgment of the High Court the 1st party has filed this revision

application.

The 1st party had a right of appeal against the Judgment of the

High Court. According to paragraph 19 of the petition filed

before this Court, it is stated that petition of appeal was filed

3

against the Judgment of the High Court. If it is so, it is not clear

why he filed a revision application thereafter. The 1st party has

not averred any exceptional circumstances in this belated

revision application when he himself says that he preferred a

final appeal against the said Judgment. On that ground alone,

this revision application is liable be dismissed in limine.

Be that as it may, the 1st party heavily relies on the Fiscals

report relating to the execution of the writ in the Magistrates

Court to say that the order of the learned Magistrate on the

question of possession is erroneous. The 2nd party does not

admit the contents of the said report. Even assuming the

contents of the said report is correct, the learned Magistrate

could not have taken it into consideration as it came into being

after the order was delivered. The learned Magistrate has

delivered the order on the facts presented before him prior to the

delivery of the order.

It is undisputed that the 1st party was not in physical possession

of the building. He says that he purchased the property from

the 2nd party by way of a Deed of Transfer. The position of the

2nd party is that the said Deed was executed as security to a

loan obtained from the 1st party. That matter has be decided by

a District Court.

The 1st party says that he rented out the upstairs of the building

to one Wijedasa and collected rent. There is no dispute that

Wijedasa had been there as a tenant for a long time under the

2nd party. Thereafter, according to the learned Magistrate, the

4

2nd party has asked Wijedasa to pay rent direct to the 1st party

because of the aforesaid loan transaction.

The learned Magistrate has refused to accept the informal Lease

Agreement tendered by the 1st party as a genuine one. Hence

the learned Magistrate has not accepted the version of the 1st

party that he had been in possession of the premises through

Wijedasa.

Also the learned Magistrate has not accepted the version of the

intervenient party that he was in possession of the ground floor

of the building as a tenant of the 1st party. Nor has he accepted

the informal Lease Agreement tendered in that regard either as a

genuine one.

The learned Magistrate has noted that the 1st party in his first

complaint has not mentioned that he has rented out the ground

floor of the building to the intervenient party, and also the fact

that the intervenient party has not made any police complaint

regarding any obstruction to his possession.

In the counter affidavit tendered to the Magistrates Court, the

1st party has accepted that the possession of the building is with

the 2nd party. If it is a mistake, it has not been corrected so far.

This matter has been raised in the High Court by the 2nd party.

The order of the learned Magistrate is a well-considered one.

There is no necessity to repeat each and every point the learned

Magistrate has dealt with in his order.

I see no reason to interfere with it or the Judgment of the High

Court which affirmed it. The 1st party shall vindicate his rights

5

to the property on the disputed Deed of Transfer in the District

Court.

Application is dismissed without costs.
