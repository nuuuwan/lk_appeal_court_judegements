K. PRIY ANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. 15t to 4th Accused Appellants (Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of

Awissawella on two counts for being in possession and trafficking of 15.62

grams of Heroin respectively, contrary to sections 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the

Poison Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. After trial the learned High

Court Judge found the Appellants guilty of the charges and sentenced them to

imprisonment for life. Being aggrieved by the said conviction, the Appellants

preferred the instant appeal.

02. At the argument stage counsel for the Appellants pursued only one ground of

appeal.

I. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the concept of joint

possession of heroin.

03. Counsel for the 15\ 3'd and 4th Appellants made submissions at the argument

and the counsel for the 2nd Appellant informed court that he associates with the

submissions made by the counsel for the 15\ 3'd and 4th Appellants.

04. Facts of the case in brief are as follows. PW 1 who conducted the raid had been

attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau as an Inspector. According to his

testimony at the trial, Constable Susantha Kumarage (PW2) had received the

information about a house that was being used to pack and distribute heroin.

On receiving that information, after obtaining permission from the Officer in

Charge he had organized the raid. Ten police officers had participated in the

raid.

05. On their way the informant had got into their vehicle and had guided them to

the house in question. PWI had given evidence in detail as to how they reached

the double story house. They had placed themselves outside the house that was

covered by a parapet wall. One officer had jumped over the wall and had

opened the gate. They had surrounded the house and from the window he had

seen a man seated on the floor in the sitting room. Right hand side of that man

there had been a woman seated. In front of the woman there had been another

man. There had been another man seated facing the other side of PWI. He had

observed the four of them bending and doing something like packing. A radio

had been on with loud volume inside the house.

06. PW I had instructed two of the other officers to kick and break open the door,

which they did. As they entered the house, the before mentioned all four

persons including the woman had suddenly stood up. There had been a glass

pad on the floor and on the said pad there had been pieces of paper those

contained small quantities of heroin on them. There had been another

cellophane bag that contained heroin and also a spoon. With his experience,

PWI had suspected the substance found on the pieces of paper and the

cellophane bag to be heroin. They had arrested the four suspects with the

productions.

07. Learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that according to the evidence of

the PWI and the other officers who were present at the raid, they had not found

anything in the possession of the Appellants individually. As the police officers

entered the house, Appellants had been standing and there had been no illicit

drugs in their person.

08. Counsel further submitted that the learned Trial Judge has not analyzed or

discussed about joint possession. Contention of the counsel is that the court

4

cannot infer possession and that the available evidence IS not sufficient to

prove joint possession.

09. Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent contended that it was

evident that the PWI observed packing being done by the Appellants from the

window. It is the contention of the learned DSG that the Appellants had been

jointly possessing the illicit drugs and that court cannot come to any other

conclusion.

10. In case of Alagaratnam and Others V. The Republic [1986} 1 Sri L.R. at page

237, court observed that the question of joint possession must be determined on

the facts and circumstances of each case.

II. In case of R. V. Searle [1971} Crim L.R. 592, CA, the defendants were

convicted of possessing a quantity of various dangerous drugs which had been

found in a vehicle used by them for a touring holiday. It was alleged that they

were all in joint possession of all the drugs. Possession of any particular drug

could not be attributed to any particular defendant. The Court held;

" ... Mere knowledge of presence of a forbidden article in the hands

of a confederate was not enough: joint possession had to be established.

The sort of direction which ought to have been given was to ask the jury

to consider whether the drugs formed a common pool from which all had

the right to draw at will, and whether there was a joint enterprise to

consume drugs together because then the possession of drugs by one of

them in pursuance of that common intention might well be possession on

the part of all of them .... "

12. In the instant case, the prosecution witness had seen through the window, all

Accused Appellants seated around on the floor and bending and doing

something like packing. As the raiding party instantly entered the house by

break opening the door, all four Appellants had stood up. In the middle of

them, the illicit drugs, cut pieces of paper that contained drugs on a glass pad

and a spoon were found. I S\ 2nd and 4th Appellants in their dock statements

admitted being present at the house where the raid took place and the fact that

they were arrested, however, denied any involvement with the drugs. 3rd

Appellant in his dock statement totally denied any involvement. The learned

High Court Judge for the reasons given rejected their denial of any

involvement.

13. The question to be decided was whether all four Appellants jointly possessed

the drugs. It is clear from the evidence that all four Appellants had been seated

on the floor around the glass pad where the illicit drugs were placed. Material

used to pack the drugs in small quantities also had been there. Obviously all

four of them could have seen what was going on. Their evidence of denial of

any involvement with the drugs is rejected. Hence, there is sufficient evidence

to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they all were in joint possession of the

illicit drugs that were found.

14. After analyzing the evidence on possessIon of the drugs, the learned Trial

Judge at page 47 of her Judgment said;

IS. The complaint of the learned counsel for the Appellants is that the learned Trial

Judge has failed to consider the concept of joint possession of heroin.

However, when one reads the above paragraph as well as the analysis of the

evidence in her Judgment, it is clear that when the learned Trial Judge said

'?2JJC-'ro CJ2JJO (ffi'<;~3(ffi'a:! e"ro2JJR!S)(ffi'c! :11&', she has referred to joint possession

although she had not used the same word. Although the learned Trial Judge has

clearly analyzed the evidence which proves joint possession of the drugs by the

Appellants, she has failed to describe what is joint possession. Hence, I am of

the view that this is a fit case for this court to act in terms of proviso to Section

334 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the proviso to Article 138 of

the Constitution.

Proviso to Section 334(1);

The Court of Appeal on any appeal against conviction on a

verdict of a jury shall allow the appeal if it thinks that such verdict

should be set aside on the ground that it is reasonable or cannot be

supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of

the Court before which the Appellant was convicted should be set

aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of any

law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice, and

in any other case shall dismiss the appeal;

Provided that the court may, not withstanding that it is of

opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in

favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no

substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

16. In case of Somasiri V. Hon. Attorney General SC (Appeal) 7912009, referring

to case of Mannar Mannan V. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1990} 1 Sri L.R.

page 280 and case of Moses V. State [1999} 3 Sri L.R. 401 held that the

proviso to section 331 may be applied to non jury trials as well.

Proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution;

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by any Court of first Instance, tribunal or other

institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such Court of First

instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court

shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or

irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned afailure of justice.

17. The applicability of Section 334(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was

extensively dealt with in Mannar Mannan V. The Republic of Sri Lanka

[1990} 1 Sri L.R. page 280 Court said;

" I. The enacting part of the sub-section (1) of section 334 'mandates' the

court to allow the appeal where-

8

Website Copy Website Copy

(a) the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to

the evidence; or

(b) there is a wrong decision on any question of law; or

(c) there is a miscarriage of justice on any ground.

The proviso clearly vests a discretion in the court and recourse

to it arises only where the appellant has made out at least one of

the grounds postulated in the enacting part of the sub-section.

There is no warrant to the view that the court is precluded from

applying the proviso in any particular category of 'wrong decision '

or misdirection on questions of law as for instance, burden of

proof

There is no hard and fast rule that the proviso is inapplicable

where there is non direction amounting to a misdirection in regard

to the burden of proof What is important is that each case, falls to

be decided on a consideration of (a) the nature and intent of the

non-direction amounting to a misdirection on the burden of proof

(b) all facts and circumstances of the case, the quality of the

evidence adduced and the weight to be attached to it. "

18. The above position was also accepted by the Supreme Court in Case of

Somasiri V. Hon. Attorney General SC (Appeal) 7912009, decided on

11.07.2014.

19. As I stated before in this Judgment, there is clear evidence to prove beyond

reasonable doubt that the Appellants were in joint possession of the drugs

recovered. There is no substantial miscarriage of justice caused to the

9

Appellants by the learned Trial Judge not describing what is joint possession.

Hence, I find no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the learned High

Court Judge. The ground of appeal urged by the Appellants should fail.

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge convicting the Appellants on both

counts is affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J

I agree.
