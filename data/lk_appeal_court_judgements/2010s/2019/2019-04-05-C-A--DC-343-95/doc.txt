M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the District Court of Tangalle

dated 19.07.1995, in respect of a partition action bearing case No.

2023/P.

When this matter was taken up for hearing, this Court observed that

main averment of the 2nd Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) is that a

share of the subject matter which he purchased by Deed No. 18656

dated 27.04.1976 marked as 2D1 has not been given to him by the

learned Trail Judge, while the other deeds of the Appellant marked as

2D2 and 2D3 have been accepted by the Judge and the Appellant

has obtained a share of 88/720 by these two deeds.

It is to be noted that, according to the judgment of the Trial Judge, the

main reason for the decision to deprive the alleged share 22/720 of

the Appellant is the failure, to register the deed 2D1 in the proper

folio.

The Appellant stated that the above share of the land which belonged

to a co-owner one Davith had been sold by him to the Appellant and

several years after that again to the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent. The said

Daviths name appears in the 2nd Plaintiff-Appellants deed bearing No.

10 dated 05.11.1979 (P7). He further stated that the said Davith who

was entitled to 22/720 share had already sold his share by Deed 2D1

before executing the Deed P7, more than three years ago. Therefore,

the Appellant is in position that the subsequent deed P7 has no

validity as far as the share of the said Daavith is concerned.

It is also revealed from the case record that the previous owner who

had a large share of the subject land has registered his deed No. 2814

4

(P4) in folio A12/308. Thereafter the deed P7 has been registered in

folio F80/07. But the deed 2D1 has been registered in folio A32/10,

therefore, its quite clear that the deed 2D1 is not registered in

continuation of the folio in which the first registered instrument in

respect of the said land is registered. However, the Appellant stressed

that this non-continuation (omission/defective) is only a technical

consideration which would not be penalized the buyer of the property.

In contrast, it was a strong contention of the Plaintiff-Respondents

that the competing Deed (2D1) of the Appellant is not registered in any

of the said proper folios. Therefore, they had taken a position that the

aforesaid non-continuation (omission/defective) of the Appellant

should be regarded in favour of them.

I do not reluctant to subscribe to the above submission of the

Respondents. It is settled law that the benefit of priority by

registration accrues to a subsequent Deed for valuable consideration

as against an earlier deed from the same source which is either not

registered or not duly registered. (Vide: Section 14 of the Registration of

Documents Ordinance, No. 23 of 1927 as amended subsequently)

[Also See: SILVA vs. SARAH HAMY (1883) Wendts Reports 383;

PERERA vs. PREMAWATHIE 74 NLR 302 and HEENAPPUHAMY vs.

CHARLES 77 NLR 169].

In the circumstances, I am of the view that, the learned Trial Judge

carefully had considered the relevant evidence of the parties and

correctly dismissed the Appellants claim, especially, with regard to

the deed 2D1, while allocating the substantiated shares (through the

two other deeds 2D2 and 2D3).

5

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with said judgment of the Trial

Judge. Accordingly, I uphold the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Tangalle and dismiss the appeal. I also award costs in a sum

of Rs. 15,000/- payable to the Plaintiff-Respondents by the 2nd

Defendant-Appellant.

Appeal dismissed.
