The Vehicle claimant-Petitioner-Appellant filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Uva

Province holden in Monaragala dated 13.11.2013 in Case No. REV 19/2010 and

seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of

Monaragala dated 30.07.2010 in Case No. 38516.

Facts of the case:

A vehicle bearing No. UPRA - 2698 (Tractor) along with a trailer was arrested

with its driver and the assistant on or about 16.09.2009 for transporting timber

valued at Rs. 121312.88 without a valid permit. The driver and the assistant were

charged before the Learned Magistrate of Monaragala under section 25(2) read

with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. Both of them pleaded guilty to the charge

and the Learned Magistrate convicted both accused and imposed a fme of

Rs.15,0001=. Thereafter the vehicle claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the 'appellant') claimed the tractor in a vehicle inquiry and one

Premathilake claimed the trailer. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned

Magistrate confiscated the tractor and the trailer by order dated 30.07.2010.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court of Monaragala and the Learned High Court

Judge affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed this appeal.

The following grounds of appeal were averred on behalf of the appellant;

1. The Learned Magistrate considered the amended section in Act No. 65 of

2009 whereas the offence was committed on 16.09.2009 and the Act came

into operation from 16.11.2009

2. The Learned Magistrate failed to consider the element of knowledge of the

vehicle owner

3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the Learned

Magistrate erred in considering evidence that was proved on a balance of

probability

4. The orders of the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge are

contrary to law.

I observe that the first ground of appeal was very correctly addressed by the

Learned High Court Judge in his order dated 13.11.2013. The Learned High Court

Judge has compared law relevant to confiscating a vehicle under the Forest

Ordinance prior to and subsequent to the amendment Act No. 65 of 2009. This

question of law was addressed in light of case law as well. The Learned High

Court Judge was of the view that the burden cast on a vehicle owner under section

40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Act No. 65 of 2009 is not very different

from the previous law where it required a vehicle owner to prove on a balance of

probability either he took all precautions or he had no knowledge of an offence

being committed. It is observed that proving of all precautions taken by a vehicle

owner remained a requirement under both previous law and the present law.

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge arrived at the correct conclusion that no

prejudice had been caused to the petit~oner (Page 52 - 57 of the brief).

Page 4of8

'.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the Learned Magistrate had

failed to consider the element of knowledge namely whether the vehicle had been

used for committing of the offence without the knowledge of the owner.

In the vehicle inquiry before the Magistrate's court, following witness had given

evidence.

1. Owner of the vehicle

11. Driver of the vehicle

111. An assistant of the driver of the vehicle

IV. Owner of the Timber (Sunil Bandara)

The owner of the trailer testified to claim his trailer.

As per the evidence, the appellant used the vehicle for fanning and he had assigned

both accused persons as a driver and an assistant. The appellant had testified that

the driver takes his vehicle in the morning and would return it in the evening, but

some occasions the driver keeps the vehicle with him and he returns it in the next

mornmg.

On the date of incident, the driver had called the appellant at 9pm to infonn that

there was a puncture which needed to be repaired. As per the appellant, the vehicle

was given for transporting of bricks and the appellant had infonned the driver to

finish the hire and bring the vehicle. Thereafter the appellant had not inquired

about the vehicle from the driver. The next day morning he got to know that the

driver and the assistant were arrested for transporting timber without license.

At the claim inquiry, the driver named Somasiri testified that he took the vehicle to

transport bricks and afterwards he transported timber and therefore the owner was

not aware of the timber transportation. The driver further testified that on some

Page 50f8

days he would keep the vehicle with him and will return it on the next day morning

and the appellant would not check about the vehicle. The driver stated that he had

not informed the appellant about the tyre puncture in the night and the petitioner

got to know all the details after they were arrested by the police. Sunil Bandara

who was the owner of timber in question stated that the timber was transported on

his request and he persuaded the driver and the cleaner to do so.

Accordingly it was argued that the owner did not have any knowledge about the

incident. The Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that before the amendment

it was a well settled law that confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes

one of two matters i.e. the owner had taken all the necessary precautions that he

could take to prevent the crime or he had no knowledge of an offence being

committed. At this juncture, it is noteworthy that the Learned High Court Judge

has evaluated the evidence again and held that the contradictions in the evidence of

the witnesses infer knowledge on the part of the appellant about illegal activities

carried out utilizing his vehicle. The Learned High Court Judge observed that the

appellant failed to disclose the details as to why he needed a trailer to do farming

and it shows that he was using it for transportation. I wish to express my agreement

on this observation of the Learned High Court Judge.

The registered owner of the trailer stated that he gave the trailer to his cousin over

5 years ago and cousin gave that trailer to a friend. The trailer owner admitted that

he did not have any control over his vehicle.

In the case of W. JaJathge Surasena V. O.I.C, Bikkaduwa and 3 others [CA

(PHe) APN 100/2014], it was held that,

" ... A mere denial by the of Registered Owner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge, of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle

Page 6 ofa

laid down in the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of '!- vehicle

which had been used for a commission of an offence for an unauthorized

purpose ... "

In the case of K.W.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura and another [eA (PHC) 89/2013], it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance,

making use of that vehicle ... Nothing is forthcoming to show that he has

taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being committed by

using this vehicle though he was the person who had the power to exercise

control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore, it is evident that

no meaningful step had been taken either by the owner or his power of

attorney holder, of the vehicle that was confiscated in order to prevent an

offence being committed by making use of this vehicle. "

In light of above, it is understood that mere denial of knowledge is not sufficient to

discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner in question and he is required to

prove, on a balance of probability, that he took all precautions to prevent an

offence being committed utilizing his vehicle.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the owner had given special

instructions not to uSe the vehicle for illegal activities and vehicle had not been

used for any illegal activities prior to this incident.

Page 7of8

However in the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva rCA (PHC) 86/97],

it was held that,

"For these reasons I hold that giving mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the

instructions... "

Therefore a vehicle owner is required to prove what actions he took in order to

make sure that the instructions were in fact implemented. This position was very

correctly considered by both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court

Judge and both of them had made well explained orders. Therefore I do not see any

reason to interfere with the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

13.11.2013 and the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 30.07.2010. I affirm the

same.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree,
