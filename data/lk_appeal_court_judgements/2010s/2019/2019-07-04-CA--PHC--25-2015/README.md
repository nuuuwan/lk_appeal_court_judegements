This is an Appeal by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant)

against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the North Western Province

holden in Chilaw to have order dated 11103/2015 set aside.

3

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) initiated

proceedings in the Magistrate's Court of Chilaw against the Appellant on a

certificate filed under Section 3D(2) read with Section 53 and 63 of the Wages

Boards Ordinance No. 27 of 1941 as amended (ordinance), seeking to recover a

sum of Rs. 300,000/51, as unpaid salaries of two workmen for the period from

01106/2009 to 31108/2011. The learned Magistrate, after inquiry, by order dated

18/1212004, directed the recovery of the said sum from the Appellant as a fine.

The Appellant moved in revision to the High Court of Chilaw, however, was

refused notice by the learned High Court Judge.

In this application, the Appellant argues that the certificate filed by the

Respondent is not a valid certificate within the meaning of Section 3D(2) of the

Ordinance, in that "particulars of the sum"" claimed, sought to be recovered by the

said certificate is not stated. The Appellant contends that the particulars contained

in the said certificate does not give the names of the workmen or the period which

there had been a short payment by the employer. It is further contended that the

certificate does not identify the type of work done by the workmen and that

providing such particulars is an imperative requirement of the law. Therefore, the

learned counsel for the Appellant submits that the law clearly imposes a duty on

the Respondent to give such particulars of the composition of the total sum arrived

at and therefore, the certificate filed is . not a certificate within the meaning of

4

Section 3D(2) of the Ordinance. The Appellant took up the said question of law

before the learned Magistrate.

However, the Respondent contends that, it is not necessary to include all

particulars in the certificate of employment since Section 46(3) of the Ordinance

gives adequate notice of contributions and defaults and all computation of

particulars of the amount sought to be recovered.

Section 3D of the Ordinance regulates the recovery of arrears of wages in

persons employed in certain trades. Section 3D(1) enables the Commissioner of

Labour to calculate the wages or short payment of wages upon consideration of

both oral and documentary evidence available. The said sum calculated can be

recovered as a fine by way of a certificate filed before the Magistrate's Court

having jurisdiction in terms of Section 3D(2) of the Ordinance. Section 3D(3)

provides limitations upon the questionability as to the correctness of any such

statement in the Certificate issued by the Commissioner of Labour and would not

be called in question or examined at any proceedings before the Court.

Section 3D (3) states,

"The correctness of any statement in a certificate issued by the

Commissioner for the purposes of this Section shall not be called in

question or examined by the Court in any proceedings under this

Section, and accordingly, nothing in this Section shall authorize the

Court to consider or decide the correctness of any statement in such

certificate, and the Commissioner's certificate shall be sufficient

evidence that the amount due under Sub-section (1) from the defaulting

employer has been duly calculated and that such amount is in default. "

5

The wording in Section 3D(3) of the Ordinance is identical to the wording

In Section 38(3) of the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as

amended, (EPF Act) is not in dispute. "----the Ordinance and the EPF Act are

Acts in "pari material" as they deal with labour relations with a view to safeguard

the interest of the worker" (CA (PHC) 195/2013, CA (PHC)/APN/I05/2015). The

respective parties are not at variance regarding the said position.

Beal's Cardinal Rules of Interpretation at p. 402 provides that Statutes in

"pari material" should be interpreted alike;

"where there are different statutes in pari materia, though made at

different times or even expired or repealed, and not referring to each other, and

though using different language, they shall be taken and interpreted together as

one system and as explanatory of each other. " - Rex v. Loxdale (1758), 1 Burr.

445, at p. 447, Lord Mansfield, C.J. [cited by Farwell, LJ., in Goldsmiths'

Company v. Wyatt, [1907] 1 K. B. 95, at p. 105; 76 L.J.K.B. 166, at p. 169]

It further provides that "Whatever has been determined in the

interpretation of one of several statutes in pari materia is a sound rule of

interpretation of the other. "- Rex v. Mason (1788),2 T.R. 581, at p.586, Buller J.

The above position is cited with approval in the case of Yakoob Bai v.

Samimuttu 51 NLR 345 at page 346.

In Mohamed Ameer and Another v. Assistant Commissioner of Labour

(1998) 1 SLR 156, in a matter coming within Section 38(2) of the EPF Act, the

Court identified two distinct questions arising in relation to enforcement

proceedings commenced in terms of a certificate issued under Section 38(2) of the

EPF Act.

"The first is whether the certificate sets out the particulars of the sum due,

in the manner and to the extent required by Section 38(2). If it does not, the

certificate does not satisfy Section 38(2), and no further proceedings can be had.

(as to the sufficiency of particulars). "

"The second question only arises where the necessary particulars have

been given which will be in the form of statements in the certificate, as to persons,

periods, amounts, etc. "

The issue in the instant case is the question of validity of the said certificate

due to want of particulars.

Upon perusal of the certificate filed in terms of Section 3D(2) of the

Ordinance, I do not see any particulars given to adequately identify the employees

in respect of whom default is alleged and the contributions alleged to have been

defaulted. The submission of the counsel for the Respondent is that, since all

7

particulars were given to the employer in terms of Section 46(3) of the Ordinance,

the requirement of notice is fulfilled and therefore, no further notice is required.

This argument is untenable. The certificate should contain particulars to the extent

required by Section 3D(2), of the Ordinance.

In City Carriers Ltd. V. The Attorney General (1992) 2 SLR 257, the

Court came to a clear finding that "Where the certificate contains no particulars

of the sum claimed, there is in law no certificate ".

In Mohamed Ameer and Another v. Assistant Commissioner of Labour

(supra), Fernando J. observed that;

"The issue of a certificate does not compel the Magistrates Court to

proceed, automatically, to recover the sum stated: the Court must give

the alleged defaulter an opportunity to show cause why further

proceedings for the recovery of the sum claimed should not be taken.

The law thus expressly incorporates the audi alteram partem rule.

Fairness requires that, when a certificate a sum allegedly due, it must

also give adequate details of how it was made up to enable the alleged

defaulter to show cause. ---- but to say that the number of employees

involved was two is in my opinion quite insufficient".

The certificate filed in terms of Section 3D(2) in the appeal brief at page

463, does not give particulars as required, constitutes sufficient reason to prevent

8

the execution of the certificate. Therefore, the said certificate cannot be considered

as a certificate valid in law.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of Chilaw dated 11103/2015, and the order of the learned Magistrate

dated 18112/2014, and allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.
