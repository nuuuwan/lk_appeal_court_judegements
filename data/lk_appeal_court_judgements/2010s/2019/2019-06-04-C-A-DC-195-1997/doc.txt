Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 12th defendant-appellant filed this appeal against the

Judgment of the District Court of Horana dated 24.03.1997

entered in Partition Case No.3799/P.

The 12th defendant has filed two statements of claim. In the first

statement of claim dated 16.09.1993 she has asked 30 perches

on Deed marked 5D6. By this Deed, Emalin has sold 30

perches to the 12th defendant. Then in the undated amended

statement of claim the 12th defendant has sought exclusion of

Lot 17 of the Preliminary Plan marked at the trial X on

prescription. The issues of the 12th defendant have been raised

on the amended statement of claim.

The learned District Judge in the Judgment rejected the claim of

the 12th defendant to exclude Lot 17 from the corpus on

prescription. This he did on the strength of Deed 5D6, which

goes to prove that the 12th defendant is a co-owner of the land.

3

Hence he took the view that mere possession of a portion of the

larger land for convenience, does not itself establish prescriptive

possession.

However the learned Judge in the Judgment gave only 12/1008

share to the 12th defendant, which, according to the learned

counsel for 12th defendant-appellant, equals to roughly 8

perches.

It is the contention of the learned counsel for the 12th defendant-

appellant that, if the learned Judge relied on Deed 5D6 to hold

that she is a co-owner of the land and therefore not entitled to

seek exclusion a portion on prescription, he must give the 12th

defendant the share stated in the Deed.

It is not clear how the learned Judge calculated the said share.

In the Judgmentvide last paragraph of page 9 of the Judgment,

which continues to page 10the learned Judge has accepted

that Emalin has sold 30 perches to the 12th defendant (by 5D6).

The learned Judge in the Judgment does not say that Emalin

did not have rights to sell 30 perches to the 12th defendant by

5D6. There is no doubt Emalin did have rights so to alienate.

Upon the death of the 2nd defendant pending trial, the widow of

the 2nd defendant has been substituted as 2(a) defendant. The

2(a) defendant has given evidence at the trial. According to her

evidence, her husband, who was the original 2nd defendant, is

the son of Emalin. Emalins husband and the 2nd defendants

father is Abraham. The 2(a) defendant in her evidence in chief

itself has stated that, her mother in law, Emalin, has (by 5D6),

sold 30 perches to the 12th defendant, and she does not dispute

it. She has further stated that she shall get rights after

4

apportioning that 30 perches to the 12th defendantvide page

346 of the Brief. I must emphasize that this she stated in her

evidence in chief and not during the course of cross

examination.

Although both the learned Judge and the 2(a) defendant

accepted that the 12th defendant is entitled to 30 perches,

ultimately, the learned District Judge in the Judgment has not

given effect to it. In the Judgment the 12th defendant has been

given about 8 perches.

According to the Judgment, excluding 1 acres, from the

balance portion of the corpus, the 2nd defendant shall get

150/1008 share and the 12th defendant as I stated earlier

12/1008 share. (In addition, according to the Judgment, the 2nd

defendant gets 93/672 share from 1 acre.) If Emalin did not

execute 5D6, the 2nd defendant would also have got the

aforesaid 12/1008 share given to the 12th defendant making the

2nd defendants share to increase up to 162/1008 share

(150/1008+12/1008=162/1008).

As some portions of the land depicted in the Preliminary Plan

have been excluded in accordance with the 1st admission

recorded, it is not possible at this stage to state exactly the

fractional share for 30 perches.

Taking all the circumstances into account, including the

voluntary admissions made by the 2(a) defendant in evidence, I

decide that out of such 162/1008 share, which should have

gone to the 2nd defendant, 30 perches shall go to the 12th

defendant.

5

Improvements shall go as claimed before the surveyor. In

preparing the final scheme of partition, the surveyor will observe

the provisions of section 33 of the Partition Law, which says:

The surveyor shall so partition the land that each party entitled

to compensation in respect of improvements effected thereto or of

buildings erected thereon will, if that party is entitled to a share of

the soil, be allotted, so far as is practicable, that portion of the

land which has been so improved or built upon, as the case may

be. This does not mean that the surveyor shall necessarily give

the portion of land where improvements have been effected to

the party who is entitled to soil rights. But he shall endeavor to

give so far as is practicable.

The above variation in the District Court Judgment does not

affect the rights of the other parties including the plaintiff and

the 3rd defendant, who were represented at the argument. This

will only affect the rights of the 2nd defendant. But the aforesaid

conclusion of mine is in complete consonance with the evidence

of the 2(a) defendant. Therefore there is no ground or grouse for

her to complain.

Appeal of the 12th defendant is allowed.

Subject to the above variation, the Judgment of the District

Court is affirmed. No costs.
