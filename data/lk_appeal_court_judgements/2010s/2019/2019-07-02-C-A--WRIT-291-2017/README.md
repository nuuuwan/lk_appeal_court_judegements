When this matter was taken up on 8th May 2019, the learned Counsel for all

parties moved that judgment be delivered by this Court, on the written

submissions that have already been tendered by the parties.

The issue that arises for determination in this application is whether the 1st

Petitioner is entitled to succeed to a land in respect of which a permit had

been issued under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance to a

person by the name of Lanka Geeganage Charlis.

2

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

It is admitted between the parties that the State had issued permit No. 6088 to

Lanka Geeganage Charlis. Although a copy of the permit has not been

tendered by the Petitioners, a copy of the Land ledger pertaining to the said

... p~r~!t. has been annexed to the petition marked 'Xl'. TF1Ts Court has examined

'Xl' and ob~~esthatJbetotaJ et{tentgivJ~n~by tbe"saidper:..mitis5A.2R20P~.

comprising of a low land identified as Lot No. 476 in Final Village ,Plan No.1 in

extent of 4A 2R 30P, a high land identified as Lot No. 465 in the same plan in

extent of 3R 30P and the adjoining high land identified as Lot No. 466 in extent

of 1A 1R 31P.

The Petitioners state that Charlis had married Heenhamy and that they had

three children from the said marriage. According to the Petitioners, two of the

said children have passed away while the surviving son, Mendias has not been

named as a party to this application. The Petitioners states that Charlis had a

mistress, Nonahamy from whom Charlis had 9 children. The 1st Petitioner is a

daughter of Charlis and Nonahamy. The Petitioners states further that in 1971,

Charlis had contracted another marriage to Ceciliana While Heenhamy was

alive.

By an affidavit dated 4th August 1971, produced by the 1st Respondent marked

'IRI', Charlis had affirmed to the following:

(lomen~~ d~l!CO~ ~.~cS.8.8. 1 (I@>C:> 476 ~orm ~. (I@. 6088 ~0frJ Q)@

It is not clear whether the aforesaid affidavit relates only to the paddy land in

extent of 4A 2R 30P, in view of the reference only to Lot No. 476 or whether it

extends to the high land as well. This Court must also observe that 'Xl'

contains an endorsement to the effect that Lot No. 466 had been transferred

to Nonahamy. However, it appears that all steps taken thereafter that has now

given rise to this application relates to the paddy land only.

Charlis had passed away on 1st February 1972. It appears from 'Xl' that the

name of Charlis had been struck off from the land ledger and the name of

Ceciliana has been substituted as the permit holder on 4th May 1972. Although

it is not in dispute that Ceciliana had been issued a permit, neither party has

produced a copy of a permit said to have been issued to Ceciliana. There is a

further endorsement on 'Xl' made in 2012 stating that, ((~. Qo. ff). oes>ern 106,

ffe:l@oCSJ cnoeS> @~ (~~a)". It appears from this entry that the permit given to

Ceciliana had been cancelled during her lifetime, a position which has been

disputed by the 2nd Respondent.

The Petitioners state that Heenhamy had filed Case No. 309/0 against

Ceciliana in the District Court of Hambantota and that the learned District

Judge, by his judgment delivered on 19th July 1973, annexed to the petition

marked 'X8' had declared that Heenhamy is the lawful wife of Charlis and had

further declared as null and void, the marriage between Charlis and Ceciliana.

4

The said judgment had been affirmed by the Supreme Court by its judgment

dated 1st July 1975, annexed to the petition marked 'X8a'.

In April 1990, Lanka Geeganage David, a son of Charlis and Heenhamy had filed

Case No. L/1119 in the District Court of Hambantota against Ceciliana and the

. DiViSional Sec!~t~ry of Hambantota, seeking inter alia to cancel the permit ..

issuedto Ce~iH~ll~Jncespect of Lot No. 476 aod l.ot No. 465, and.a .declaratio.n . -_ .. ------~---~--_.

that the said land should devolve on him under and in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance. This Court has examined the amended plaint which

has been annexed to the petition marked 'X9a' and observes that the cause of

action pleaded therein is that Ceciliana was given the permit by virtue of her

marriage to Charlis and as the said marriage has now been declared null and

void, that David is entitled to succeed to the said land by virtue of being the

eldest son of Charlis. After a full trial, the learned District Judge,

Tissamaharama had dismissed the said action by his judgment dated 29th

March 2001, annexed to the petition marked as 'X9c'. It is not in dispute that

an appeal has not been lodged against the said judgment.

It appears that commencing from April 2011, the 1st Petitioner has been

agitating that a permit be issued to her in respect of the said land by virtue of

her being a daughter of Charlis. As observed earlier, there is an endorsement in

'Xl' that the permit given to Ceciliana had been cancelled in 2012. Ceciliana

had passed away in 2017.

While the request of the 1st Petitioner that she be recognized as the successor

was under consideration, the 1st Respondent, by his letter dated 31st August

5

2016 annexed to the petition marked 'X21', had informed the Officer - in -

Charge of the Tissamaharama Police as follows:

"02. LL 6088 c.oesl Q)@OQ ~o1mC.O QC)em 0@) ~ !)C) 0 ~ ~ ~lO@

Being dissatisfied with the said communication, the Petitioners have filed this

application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the aforementioned decision of the 1st

Respondent contained in 'X21';

b) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to issue a permit in

respect of the land that had been previously given by a permit to Lanka ,

Geeganage Charlis.

'X21' recognises that M.P.Dayananda is in occupation of the paddy land and

that steps are underway to resolve the 'dispute' in relation to permit No. 6088

issued to Charlis. It appears to this Court that the purpose of the final

paragraph in 'X21' is to maintain the status quo, until a final decision is arrived

at with regard to the dispute that has arisen with regard to the land that is the

6

subject matter of Permit No. 6088. It is an interim measure which recognises

the fact that the land is presently being cultivated by the 2nd Respondent, who

is a son of Ceciliana. This Court does not see any illegality in this decision,

especially since the Petitioners have not been in occupation of the said land

and no evidence has been provided to this Court that she cultivated the said

rand and/or that she has been dispossessed by the 2nd Re~pondent. In these

circumstances,this Court does not see any legal basis to issue tlieWrit of

Certiorari prayed for.

The Petitioners have complained to this Court that the 1st Respondent has

failed to conduct an inquiry to determine who should succeed to the said land.

As observed earlier, the first paragraph of 'X21' makes it clear that 'X21' has

been issued as an interim measure. The 1st Respondent must conduct an

inquiry in order to determine who is entitled to be issued a permit in respect of

the land referred to in Permit No. 6088. It appears to this Court that the prayer

for the aforementioned Writ of Mandamus has been sought probably due to

the failure on the part of the 1st Respondent to conduct a proper inquiry.

The application of the Petitioners for a Writ of Mandamus that a permit be

issued to her is on the basis that she is a daughter of Charlis. However, the

Respondents have set out in their Statement of Objections the reasons why

the Petitioners are not entitled to a permit. It is the view of this Court that the

person who is entitled to be issued a permit in respect of the land referred to

in Permit No. 6088 is a matter that should be considered and determined by

the 1st Respondent, after affording a hearing to all parties including the 1st

Petitioner, the 2nd Respondent and Mendias, who is the surviving son from the

marriage between Charlis and Heenhamy. Hence, while this Court does not see

7

any legal basis to issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed for, this Court directs the

1 st Respondent to conduct an inquiry and resolve the dispute with regard to

succession to the land referred to in Permit No. 6088, within four months from

the date of this judgment.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed, without costs.
