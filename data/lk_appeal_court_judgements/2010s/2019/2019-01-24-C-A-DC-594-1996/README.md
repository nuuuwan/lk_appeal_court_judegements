Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Manohara de Silva, P.C., for the Plaintiff-

Appellant.

Dr. Sunil Cooray for the Defendant-Respondents.

Decided on: 22.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the three defendants

seeking declaration of title to the land described in the schedule

to the plaint, ejectment of the defendants therefrom and

damages. The defendants sought dismissal of the action. After

trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs action

on the basis that, as the defendants are also co-owners of the

land, the dispute shall be resolved by way of a partition action.

It is against the said Judgment the plaintiff has filed this appeal.

The original owner of the land was Jinadasa. His two daughters

are the 1st defendant Pushpawathie, and Seelawathie whose

children are the 2nd and 3rd defendants. Jinadasa gifted that

property subject to the life interest of himself and his wife to

Pushpawathie and Seelawathie by the Deed of Gift marked P9.

Thereafter he has purportedly revoked that gift by the Deed of

Revocation marked P10 and parted with portions of the land by

subsequent Deeds.

The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

plaintiff-appellant (appellant) before this Court is two-fold:

3

(a) There was no acceptance of the Deed of Gift

(b) The Deed of Revocation is valid

At the time the Deed of Gift was executed the two donees were

minors. Therefore, the gift has been accepted, on the face of the

Deed of Gift, by Chandrasena, on behalf of Seelawathie whom he

has identified in the Deed as his wife, and Seelawathies sister,

the 1st defendant Pushpawathie. Notwithstanding Chandrasena

in the Deed of Gift has identified himself as the husband of

Seelawathie and the son-in-law of the donor Jinadasa, according

to the Marriage Certificate marked P11, Chandrasena and

Seelawathie have got married about one month after the

execution of the said Deed.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant has cited a

number of authorities for the proposition that for there to be

proper acceptance of a donation, either the person should be

recognized by law as a lawful guardian, such as mother, father,

grandmother or grandfather, or there need to be lawful

authorization for such by a third party to accept a donation on

behalf of a minor. According to the learned Presidents Counsel,

there was no proper acceptance of the said gift as stated above,

and therefore the gift is invalid. I regret my inability to accept

that argument.

The general principle is that a donation is not complete unless it

is accepted by the donee.

Hendrick v. Sudritaratne (1912) 3 CAC1 80 is on all fours with

the present case. That was a case a father executed a Deed of

Gift subject to his life interest in the name of her minor

daughter, which was accepted by her future husband. The

lower Court took the view that there was no valid acceptance of

the gift. Setting aside the said Judgment, it was held in appeal:

Under the Roman-Dutch Law no particular form is required

for the acceptance of the gift. It is in every case a question

of fact whether or not there are sufficient indications of the

acceptance by the donee.

A deed of gift to a minor may be accepted by the minor

himself or through any agent recognised by him for that

purpose. A future husband of a minor daughter is entitled

to act as an agent in that behalf.

It was further held that there is a rebuttable presumption in

favour of the acceptance of the deed, and the burden is on the

party who asserts that it was not accepted to rebut that

presumption. Lascelles C.J. at page 81 stated:

There is, I think, a natural presumption in all these cases

that the deed is accepted. Every instinct of human nature

is in favour of that presumption, and I think that, where a

valuable gift has been offered, and it is alleged that it has

not been accepted, some reason should be shewn for the

alleged non-acceptance of the gift.

The plaintiff in this case has manifestly failed to rebut that

presumption.

Wood Renton J. whilst entirely agreeing with Lascelles C.J., at

page 83 further added:

Although under the deed the donor retained a life interest,

there was no room in law, and there took place in fact, a

present acceptance of the dominium which the deed

conferred subject to the life interest.

The principle that the question of acceptance is one of fact and

each case has to be determined according to its merits is well

established.

In The Government Agent, Southern Province v. Karolis (1986) 2

NLR 72 it was held that:

The law favours the acceptance of gifts in the case of

minors. The acceptance on the face of the deed by some

person or other is not necessary: acceptance will be

presumed when there are circumstances to justify such

presumption.

In Bindua v. Unity (1910) 13 NLR 259 it was held that:

Acceptance may be manifested in any way in which assent

may be given or indicated. The question of acceptance is a

question of fact, and each case has to be determined

according to its own circumstances.

In this case Wood Renton J. with Grenier J. agreeing at page

261 stated:

For the purpose of determining whether there was such an

acceptance, we are entitled to look not only at the

6

circumstances accompanying, but also at those subsequent

to the date of the donation.

That means, subsequent conduct of the donor is also relevant

when determining the question of acceptance of the gift. In the

instant case, the donor, unilaterally decided to revoke the Deed

of Gift by the Deed of Revocation marked P10 (which I will deal

with later) by giving two grounds. However, it is interesting to

note that there he does not state the failure to accept the deed

as a ground for revocation. If the gift was not accepted, I am

quite certain that he would have stated it as the first ground.

Vide Bertie Fernando v. Missie Fernando [1986] 1 Sri LR 211.

This is clearly an afterthought. It is only after the purported

revocation, subsequent deeds have been executed.

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that there is a valid acceptance

of the Deed of Gift by Chandrasena on behalf of both the donees.

The next matter to be considered is whether the Deed of

Revocation marked P10 is valid.

The donor has not reserved the power of revocation in the Deed

of Gift. Hence the general principle is that it is irrevocable. The

donor in the Deed of Revocation, as I stated earlier, gives two

reasons for revocation. One is failure to provide succour and

assistance to the donor and his wife in violation of a condition of

the Gift and the other is he is governed by the Kandyan Law.

If the latter position was factually correct, the revocation would

have been valid as the Kandyan Law (unless there is a very

special clause of renunciation of the right to revoke) reserves to

7

the donor the right to revoke a gift during his lifetime without

the consent of the donee or any other person and without the

sanction of Court. Vide Dullewe v. Dullewe (1968) 71 NLR 289

(PC), Sirisena v. Eyelyn de Silva [2003] 2 Sri LR 255. However,

this position, i.e. that the donor was subject to the Kandyan Law

was false, and no evidence was led to that effect at the trial, and

no such a position was taken up before this Court. Any person

claiming to be subject to any special law in derogation of the

common law must prove it. Vide Piyadasa v. Babanis [2006] 2

Sri LR 17. The conclusion is irresistible that the donor is subject

to the common law.

The remaining question is whether the Deed of Gift P9 executed

subject to the condition that the donees shall provide succour

and assistance to the donor and his wife can be revoked by the

donor himself without a decision of Court on the basis that

donees failed to provide such succour and assistance (as stated

in the deed) from the date of the gift until the date of revocation.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant has

drawn the attention of the Court to (a) R.W. Lee, An Introduction

to Roman Dutch Law, page 297; (b) Maarsdorp on Obligation,

Vol III, pages 96-98; and (c) The Laws of Ceylon by Walter

Pereira, Vol III, pages 524-525 in this regard. However, the

celebrated authors in those treatises, although state revocation

of a gift is possible on various grounds including gross

ingratitude on the part of the donee (over which there is no

dispute), have not stated that revocation can be done by the

donor unilaterally by executing another deed without a decision

8

of the Court. That is not the position under the Roman-Dutch

Law.

The Notary who executed the Deed of Revocation marked P10

was called as a witness of the plaintiff. He is an Attorney-at-Law

as well. He, in his evidence (at page 169 of the Brief) has

categorically stated that even though two reasons were stated in

the deed as reasons for revocation of the Deed of Gift, in fact, the

Deed of Gift was revoked because the donor Jinadasa told him

that he was subject to the Kandyan Law, and he knew very well

that an irrevocable Deed of Gift cannot be revoked by a

subsequent Deed of Revocation without a decision of Court on

the ground of ingratitude.

In the Supreme Court case of Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera

Menike v. Rohini Senanayake [1992] 2 Sri LR 180 Amerasinghe J.

held:

Although a gift is generally irrevocable it is revocable

(i) if the donee failed to give effect to a direction as to its

application (donatio sub mode) or

(ii) on the ground of the donee's ingratitude or

(iii) if at the time of the gift the donor was childless but

afterwards became the father of a legitimate child by

birth or legitimation.

A donor is entitled to revoke a donation on account of

ingratitude.

(i) if the donee lays manus impias (impious hands) on

the donor

(ii) If he does him an atrocious injury

9

(iii) If he wilfully causes him great loss of property

(iv) If he makes an attempt on his life

(v) If he does not fulfil the conditions attached to the gift

(vi) Other, equally grave causes.

Slight acts of ingratitude are insufficient for revocation.

What amounts to an act of ingratitude sufficient to warrant

revocation must vary with the circumstances of each case.

Ingratitude is a form of mind which has to be inferred from

the donee's conduct. Such an attitude of mind will be

indicated either by a single act or a series of acts. The

donee-daughter by assaulting her donor-parents was guilty

of the foul offence of ingratitude. Revocation is not however

automatic. It requires a decision of the court. (emphasis

added)

In Ariyawathie Meemaduma v. Jeewani Buddhika Meemaduma

[2011] 1 Sri LR 124 Justice Amaratunga on behalf of the

Supreme Court set out the law in the following terms:

A Deed of Gift is absolute and irrevocable. That is the rule.

However, the law has recognized certain exceptions to the rule

of irrevocability. A party applying to Court to invoke the

exceptions in his favour has to satisfy Court by cogent

evidence that the Court would be justified in invoking the

exception in favour of the party applying for the same.

(emphasis added)

The Judgment of this Court by Anil Gooneratne J. in Wilson v.

Sumanawathie (CA 535/95/F decided on 30.11.2007) where it

was held that a donor could revoke a Deed of Gift on gross

10

ingratitude without a decision of Court is with respect a decision

given in per incuriam. To rectify the anomaly created by this

Judgment and to maintain the status quo which prevailed before

this Judgment, the Revocation of Irrevocable Deeds of Gift on

the Ground of Gross Ingratitude Act, No. 5 of 2017 was

particularly enacted. Section 2 of the said Act expressly states:

An irrevocable deed of gift may be revoked on the ground of

gross ingratitude, only on an order made by a competent

court, in an action filed by the donor of such deed against

the donee to have the said deed revoked.

The plaintiff did not lead any evidence to prove that donees did

not look after the donor and his wife. The evidence is to the

contrary. Vide the evidence of Sinduwa (who is a witness called

by the plaintiff) at page 173 of the Brief and the evidence of the

1st defendant at page 184.

An irrevocable Deed of Gift cannot be revoked without a decision

of Court and therefore the Deed of Revocation executed by the

donor is void ab initio.

The donor Jinadasa, soon after the execution of Deed of

Revocation, has executed several other Deeds tracing his title

only to the Deed of Revocation. If the Deed of Revocation is void

ab initio, the subsequent Deeds which flow from it, are also void

ab initio. Vide the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Padmal

Ariyasiri Mendis v. Vijith Abraham de Silva [2016] BLR 69 at 73.

I hold that the subsequent Deeds are void ab initio.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
