The 1" Party Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant), instituted proceedings in the

Magistrates Court of Colombo, in terms of Section 66 (l)(b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (as amended), for unlawfully and forcibly ousting

Page 2 of 6

him from the land in question by the 2nd Party I Sl, 2nd and 3rd Respondents-

Respondents (Respondents). The learned Magistrate by order dated 13.06.2012

decided in favour of the 3rd Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said order, the

Appellant preferred a Revision Application to the High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo. The learned High Court Judge by his order dated

22.08.2014 affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate. The Appellant is before

this Court to canvas the said orders.

Facts of the case briefly are as follows;

The premises in dispute bearing assessment No. 300, Galle Road,

Bambalapitiya, Colombo 4, consists of a building in a larger land comprising of

four lots. The said land is depicted in Plan No. 1276 dated 25.02.1977, made by P.

Sivasundaram, at page 184 of the brief. The land in dispute devolved to the 3rd

Respondent and her son in eq ual shares, after the demise of the husband of the 3 rd

Respondent.

By Agreement No. 1537 dated 11.03.2006, attested by K. Kaneshayogan

NP, the Petitioner came into possession of the disputed land where he has carried

out a car sales business under the name and style ofRasu and Company (Pvt) Ltd.

However, there is no evidence on record to show whether the Appellant had a car

sales business in the said premises.

The 3rd Respondent submits that the Appellant had sub-leased the said

property to Timberline Furniture (Pvt) Ltd., in violation of the tenns agreed upon

with the Appellant. According to the statement given by Danushka Seneviratne,

Page 3 of 6

director of Timberline Furniture (Pvt) Ltd. the said company had been in

possession of the entirety of the disputed property pursuant to the execution of an

agreement and admits that the land was given to the company by the Appellant on

a temporary basis.

The Respondents contend that the Appellant has unlawfully sub-leased out

the said disputed premises to Timberline Furniture's (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of

Arpico Company, to run a furniture business. However, as reflected in document

marked Y 4, the said company on 04/0112012 had voluntarily and peacefully

handed over the entirety of the said premises to the 1 st Respondent, the power of

Attorney holder of the 3rd Respondent, in the presence of the Bambalapitiya

Police. In the circumstances, it is contended that in the absence of evidence of a

likelihood of or of a threatened breach of the peace, the Court is not vested with

the jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings. On 6th January 2012, the 3rd

Respondent entered into Agreement, No. 619 with Nation Lanka Finance PLC,

undertaking to sell the said property to the said Nation Lanka Finance PLC. (The

said Agreement is marked "X3")

The Appellant in his affidavit dated 09/02/2012, states that he has been in

possession of the disputed land inclusive of the building for a period of 13 years

and had his personal office and the business in the name of his wife. He claims

that the I st Respondent as the power of Attorney holder of the 3rd Respondent

entered the premises in dispute and forcibly ejected him to leave behind his

valuable documents, office furniture and equipment in the said premises. The

Page 4 of 6

Appellant made a complaint to the Bambalapitiya police on 04'h January 2012,

against the said undue influence, unlawful eviction and contends that no

investigation was carried out.

The main grievance of the Appellant is that the Court has failed to consider

that the Appellant had been forcibly dispossessed, within a period of two months

immediately before the date on which, the information was filed under Section 68

(I) of the Code.

In terms of Section 66 (I)(b) of the Act a Primary Court Judge is to

ascertain whether there is a situation where breach of the peace prevails.

(Velupillai v. Sivanathan (1993)1 SLR 123, Ismail, J)

In Punchi Nona v. Padumasena & Another (1994) 2 SLR 117, [smail, J

held that,

"in an information by a private party under Sec. 66(1) (b) it is incumbent upon the

Primary Court Judge to initially satisfy himself as to whether there was a threat or

likelihood of a breach of the peace and whether he was justified in assuming such

special jurisdiction under the circumstances. Failure to so satisfy himself, deprives

the Judge of the jurisdiction"

Therefore, in the first instance it is paramount for the Court to decide on the

threat or likelihood of a breach of the peace in order for the Court to assume

jurisdiction. The learned Magistrate at page 4 of his order, has come to a clear

finding that there is no dispute affecting land and there is no forcible eviction of

Page 5 of 6

the Appellant. The said conclusion is based on document marked Y4 and the

statement given to the police by Dhanushka Seneviratne, the director of the

company, on 04/01120 12, marked Y5. According to the said statement the disputed

land has been handed over voluntarily to the power of Attorney holder of the 3rd

Respondent. Document Y5 makes reference to the entirety of the disputed land

and does not distinguish the said premises as part of the land.

In the circumstances, the available evidence infer, taking possession of the

entirety of the disputed land by the 1 Sl Respondent, voluntarily and peacefully,

which dispel the argument of forcible dispossession advanced by the Appellant.

Therefore, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate was correct in considering

the relevant evidence in deciding the applicable law which was affinned by the

Court above.

F or all the above reasons, I uphold the orders given by the learned High

Court Judge and the Court below and dismiss this application.

Appeal dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001-
