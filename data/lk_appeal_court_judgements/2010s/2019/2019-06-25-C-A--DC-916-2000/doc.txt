The Plaintiff being a maternal uncle of the pt Defendant filed this plaint against the niece-

the pt Defendant and her husband-the 2nd Defendant alleging encroachment of his land by

the Defendants. Both Deferldants filed answer denying the encroachment and set out in

their answer as to how they came to possess their distinct and separate lot which was

contiguous to the Plaintiffs land. According to the Def'~ndants, admittedly the contiguous

lots had devolved on the Plaintiff and his sister-mothei" of the pt Defendant, as these lots

were allotted to both the Plaintiff and his sister in the flnal partition decree that had been

entered on 2yd June 1996 in District Court, Kuliyapitjya Case No.2645/P.

Whilst lot 3 in the partition decree was allotted to the Plaintiff, lot 2 was allotted to the

pt Defendant's mother whD was the sister of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff alleged in his plaint

that the pt Defendant - his niece had encroached on the northern boundary of his land in

conjunction with her husband-the 2nd Defendant. It was in those circumstances he sought

a declaration that the portion that 1st Defendant had annexed to his land be declared as his

entitlement. He also sought damages in a sum of Rs 5000 jointly and severally form both

the Defendants. The pt and 2nd Defendants filed answer denying encroachment and prayed

" j for a dismissal of the plaint.

Thereafter the Plaintiff obt1ined a commission and the licensed surveyor W.E. Abeyratne

when executing his commission had superimposed th~ partition plan and in his report to

Court which was marked as 'Y', he states that there was no encroachment that he could

observe physically on the ground. In fact his version was that when he drew a red line, it

had gone on the black line both of which showed a common fence between the two in

separate and distinct lots 2nd it was his observation that there was no encroachment.

The surveyor was emphatk in his report that neither the Plaintiff nor Defendants had

encroached each other's land (please vide Para~5 at page 117 of the appeal brief). The

surveyor had also fixed every 66 feet pegs in order to make a straight fence and both the

Plaintiff and Defendants accepted this position and the common fence. This plan of the

surveyor had been done orr 1st March 1997 and the plan and the report of the commissioned

surveyor both bear the date lyh March 1997.

Fortified with a plan and:the report which confirmed the existence of a common boundary

and the fact that there was no encroachment on the part of the Defendants, the parties

entered into a settlement on the lOth July 1998.

The follOwing salient terms of the settlement are worthy of repetition;

1. Both parties admit that there is a common boundary namely a fence which existed

on the ground.

2. It consisted of a barbed wire fence.

, 3. Lot no. 5 depicted in plan no. 2166 belongs to the Plaintiff, and lot no. 2 depicted in

the same plan belongs to the Defendants.

4. Whilst the common wire fence that divides the Defendants' lot (lot 2) and the

Plaintiff's lot (lot 5) should not be disturbed, both the Plaintiff and the Defendants

agreed to put up a permanent fence with concrete posts.

In other words both Plaiatiff and Defendants could put up a fence with concrete post

inside their lands without touching the existing fence~see proceedings dated 8.2.1999 of

page 60 of the brief. If these terms constituted the terms of settlement between the parties ,

3

in 1999 and the parties accordingly signed the records-see journal entry 26 that should

have signaled the end of the case. The Journal entry No 26 dated lOth February 1999

confirms that the parties that signed the records and the proceedings on that date indicate

that the parties had reiterated the settlement entered into on lOth July 1998 and the learned

District Judge directed ,::.hat a commission be issued to the licensed surveyor Mr.

Abeyrathne who had executed a previous commission,

Although before the trial the parties had tried to settle this action, this action proceeded

to trial on 28.02.2000. At the trial the following questions were raised by both parties and

the answer of the learned District Judge in her judgmen~ is given in bold.

There was only one admission recorded at the trial, namely, paragraphs 2 and 5 of the

plaint were admitted by both parties.

Issues raised by the Plaintiff

1. Is the northern boundary of lot 3 or the boundary between lot 2 and 3, of which lot

2 the Plaintiff became entitled by Partition Case bearing No.2654/P of which the pt

defendant is a CO-OVvTIer, uncertain? No

2. Accordingly has the Plaintiff a right to demarcate a common boundary and to

construct a fence? Presently there is a fence and a common boundary. The

common boundary can be demarcated with the help of the Surveyor.

Issues raised by the Defendants

3. Has the Plaintiff fih:d this action to obtain ownerships of part of the land described

i \ in the schedule to rh::: plaint? Yes

4. Has the Plaintiff st8.ted the said portion ofland in plaint? Yes

5. If the yd issue is answered in the affirmative apd the 4th issue is answered in the

negative can the Plaintiff maintain this action? Can maintain

4

6. Cannot the Plaintiff obtain any relief on the averments made in the plaint? The

Plaintiff can demarcate the boundary as depicted in Plan 'X' between Lot2 and

LotS.

7. Has the Plaintiff averred a cause of action, in the plaint according to the reliefs he

has prayed for in the prayer to the plaint? No

8. However have the .cefendants obtained a presel iptive title over the land in which

they are in possess16n and their predecessors in title without any alternation .of the

baundaries? The Defendants have obtained a prescriptive right to Lot 2.

9. If the Defendants have encraached an ta the Plaintiff's land have they .obtained a

prescriptive right aver the partian an which the Defendants have encraached anta?

The Defendants have not encroached onto a portion of the Plaintiff's land.

A commission was issued t;a superimpase the land in dispute an Plan Na.l103 which was

the plan submitted ta Caurt in DC Kuliyapitiya Case Na.2645/P. Accardingly the Plan

Na.2166 was prepared bYH.B. Abeyarathne Licensed Survey .or and Caurt Cammissianer

(at page 115). At the trial in behalf .of the Plaintiff, the said Surveyar gave evidence and

stated that although there is a slight difference between the Plan Na.l103 and Plan

Na.2166, in the baundary between Lot 2 and 5 .of Plan Na.2166 it is nat shawn in the Plan

Na.2166 due to the reason the said difference is very negligible (at page 64). In the

.. Surveyar's Repart (at page ,116) he specifically states that the Plaintiff has nat encraached

ant a the Defendants' land and neither have the Defendants encraached anta the Plaintiff's

land (at page 117). He further states in his rep art that bath parties agreed ta th~ camman

baundary shawed by Mr. H.B. Abeyrathne Licensed Surveyor.

Thereafter the Plaintiff himself gave evidence and clased his case leading in evidence "X",

Plan Na.2166 and rep art marked as "Y", Plan Na.l103 marked as "Z",. final decree in DC

Kuliyapitiya Case Na.2645'lP marked as "PI" and certificate of nan~settlement marked as

"P2".

It transpired from, the Plaintiff's evidence that the defendants had removed the fence and

re~done the fence from one end to the other end of the fence and that the Defendants had

not encroached onto the P!~intiff's land from the middle portion of the boundary between

lot 2 and lot 5 of Plan No.2i66.

The Defendants did not give evidence and did not mark any documents and closed their

case.

Afterwards both parties filed their respective written submissions and judgment was

delivered on 05.12.2000. In the judgment the learned District judge states that the

defendants had not encroached onto any portion of the land of the Plaintiff, but however

the learned District judge goes on to state that the Plaintiff can demarcate the boundaries

lot 2 and lot 5 through the licensed Surveyor.

It has to be noted that the Plaintiff came into court OIl the basis of a rei vindicatio action

and no action for demarcation of boundaries action had been filed. Looking at the prayer

to the plaint it is clear that the Plaintiff has prayed that the Defendants be ejected from the

portion of land described ~n the schedule to the plaint and that the Plaintiff be declared

the owner of the land in dispute. The Plaintiff has even prayed that damages be paid to the

Plaintiff due to the encroo.chment by the Defendants. .

Upon a perusal of the evidence it is clear that the Defendants have not encroached onto

any portion of Lot 5 or the Plaintiff's land (as has been answered by the learned District

judge to Issue No.9 above). In such a situation the District Court should have proceeded

to dismiss this action.

! There was no issue to demarcate the boundary between Lot 1 and Lot 5 as per Plan

No.2166. In the circums'cances a relief that had not been prayed for cannot be granted.

Furthermore if the relief prayed for in the prayer to the plaint is incapable of being granted

due to lack of evidence, the plaint is liable to be dismissed.

Jt has to be accepted that there is not even a scintilla of doubt whether or not this action

is a rei vindicatio action or 3. demarcation of boundaries c'.etion.

In Surangi v. Rodrigo (2003) 3 SrLLR 35, it was held that: "no court is entitled to or has

jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the plaint; where the plaintiff

has intended to recover Rs.700,Ooor from the defendant as 'damages and she has deliberately and

.mequivocally prayed for damGges in prayer "B". Her intention is to use the damages so recovered as

permanent alimony. Therefore her claim is not a claim for alimony at all; in the absence of a prayer for

alimony the Court was correct in refusing to allow the petition to frame in issue relating to alimony".

In National Development Bank v. Rupasinghe and others (2005) 3 SrLLR 92 it was held

that: "Jurisdiction of court 'is limited and restricted to what is prayed for and no other relief could be

granted by court if not prayed fer". At page 95 Andrew Somawansa,j. (PICA) stated that: "Thus

it is to be seen that the interim i;1junction that has been ultimately issued and the other made by the learned

District Judge is much wider than the relief sought by the plaintiff-respondents themselves. It is settled law

, that the jurisdiction of Court is limited and restricted to what is prayed for and no other relief could be

granted by court not prayed for".

Accordingly I take the \ iew the rei vindicatio action ,should be dismissed for want of

evidence and I set aside the judgment dated 05.12.2000 and proceed to allow the appeal.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
