Decided on: 11.05.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two petitioners, father and mother respectively, filed this

application in the Magistrates Court of Kurunagala against their

son under section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

seeking the following reliefs in the prayer to the petition:

a) Issue notice on the respondent

b) Issue an interim order under section 67(3) of the aforesaid

Act preventing the son from entering the land

c) Order the son not to harass the petitioners and their

family members

d) Order not to commit breach of the peace

e) To confirm the peaceful and uninterrupted possession of

the petitioners in respect of the land

The son filed objections by way of an affidavit seeking to dismiss

the petitioners application and to confirm his possession to the

land and appurtenant buildings thereto.1

1 Vide page 390 of the brief.

3

Thereafter the petitioners filed unusually long counter objections

by way of an affidavit containing as much as 244 paragraphs

seeking the same reliefs as prayed for in their original affidavit.2

Both parties have filed a large number of documents in support

of their cases.

Thereafter the learned Magistrate by order dated 28.04.2016 has

ordered the petitioners to be restored in possession as they have

been forcefully dispossessed by the respondent son within two

months prior to the filing of the application.

Being aggrieved by this order, the respondent son has filed a

revision application before the Provincial High Court of

Kurunagala seeking to set aside the said order.

The learned High Court Judge has dismissed the revision

application by order dated 07.11.2017.

It is against the said order of the High Court the respondent son

(hereinafter the appellant) has come before this Court by way

of final appeal naming his father and the mother as respondents

(hereinafter the respondent).

The learned High Court Judge has not gone into the merits of

the matter, but dismissed the revision application on two

grounds:

a) No exceptional grounds have been presented, and

b) The matter is pending before a civil court

2 Vide page 159 of the brief.

4

I cannot understand on what basis the learned High Court

Judge has stated that there are no exceptional grounds when

the appellant in the petition itself has averred exceptional

grounds.

In my view, there is no magic about exceptional grounds. If

the order complained of is manifestly erroneous, that is an

exceptional ground to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Court. In cases where the aggrieved partys only remedy is to

come by way of revision, such as in a section 66 application, as

the right of appeal is expressly denied by section 74(2) of the

Act, in my view, averring exceptional circumstances is not

necessary. Showing exceptional circumstances as a threshold

test becomes necessary only in instances where a party who has

the right of appeal comes before the Appellate Court by way of

revision.

Regarding the other ground on which the revision application

was dismissed, no submissions were made by either party before

this Court that a civil case was pending in respect of the dispute

in the District Court. I find no such proof in the brief either. On

the other hand, pending a civil case does not prevent the

Magistrates Court or the High Court from entertaining an

application under section 66 so long as no interim order has

been made by the District Court.

In this regard, this is what Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) stated in

Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam:3

3 (1976) 78 NLR 280 at 282

5

In my view, the learned Magistrate has mis-directed himself

as to the nature of the proceedings under section 62 of the

Administration of Justice Law [which corresponds to section

66 in the present Law] and the ambit of his jurisdiction in

relation to proceedings pending in a civil Court. As was

stated in Imambu v. Hussenbi (A.I.R. 1960 Mysore 203) : If

a civil Court decided the question of possession even for the

purpose of giving an interim injunction, the Magistrate,

acting under Section 145 of the Indian Criminal Procedure

Code (which corresponds to section 62 of our

Administration of Justice Law) should respect that decision.

But the mere pendency of a suit in a civil Court is wholly an

irrelevant circumstance and does not take away the dispute

which had necessitated a proceeding under section 145.

The possibility of a breach of the peace would still

continue.

For the aforesaid reasons, I first set aside the order of the

learned High Court Judge.

The next matter to be decided is the correctness of the

Magistrates Court order.

At first glance, it appears to me that, the relief given by the

learned Magistrate is not what the respondent sought from the

Magistrates Court, and to that extent, the order of the learned

Magistrate is open to challenge.

According to the prayer to the petition as well as the prayer to

the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent in the Magistrates

Court, which I reproduced above (albeit not in verbatim), what

6

the respondent sought for was to confirm his possession and

prevent the appellant from entering the premises. That was on

the basis that the respondent was in possession of the premises

on the date the application was filed in Court. To put

differently, the respondent was seeking relief in terms of section

68(1) read with section 68(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act.

But the learned Magistrate granted relief to the respondent on a

completely different basis. That is on the basis that the

respondent has been forcibly evicted by the appellant within two

months before filing the application in Court. The relief granted

was in terms of section 68(3) of the Act.

I must say that the legal principles applicable in these two

instances are not the same, but completely different.

Two issues come to my mind in this regard.

Firstly, the principle that no Court is empowered to grant relief

to a party which has not been pleaded in the prayer to his

pleading. In my view, this is not an absolute principal. I will

deal with it in another case.

Secondly, the system of justice which prevails in our country is

adversarial and not inquisitorial and therefore the Judge shall

decide the matter on how it has been presented before him by

the two competing parties.

Those are technical objections, which I am not inclined to cling

on to dispose of the appeal conveniently, as it would give the

impression to the parties that their substantive issue was not

7

addressed by Court. That will not auger well for the justice

system of our country.

Hence, let me now consider on what basis the learned

Magistrate decided to grant relief to the respondent under

section 68(3).

Although the order of the learned Magistrate runs into 37 pages,

the decision of the learned Magistrate is based on two

documents tendered by the respondent, which are P50 and P53.

For better understanding I will reproduce below the relevant

portion of the order of the learned Magistrate.

The learned Magistrate in that order (which I have underlined)

stated that the respondent has admitted that the appellant,

upon the Business Names Registration Certificate marked V1,

carried on the business (in the name and style of Dias Motors

Engineers and Sales) in the premises and he (the respondent)

together with his wife as partners of that business depended on

the income of that business. (

.01

.) That means,

the learned Magistrate was satisfied that the business was

carried on by the appellant and not by the respondents, which is

not unusual concerning their advanced ages.

The learned Magistrate has then considered the complaint made

by the respondent father to the police on 01.12.2015 marked P2,

just 8 days before filing the application in the Magistrates

Court. In that complaint the respondent has stated that he

gifted the property in suit on 26.11.2015 by way of a deed to his

10

grandson (daughters son) and padlocked the entrance gate and

employed a security guard in fear of reprisals from the appellant.

Thereafter the appellant son on the following day, i.e. on

27.11.2015, has inquired from him why the premises were

padlocked, at which point the appellant has been informed

about gifting the property to the respondents grandson. The

respondent has become furious about it, and on 01.12.2015 has

forced open the gate and chased away the security guard. The

respondent has come to know about this incident from his

driver. That means, the respondents were not living in the

house adjoining the business premises. This has been noted by

the learned Magistrate in his order. (

It is relevant to note that the respondent had earlier gifted the

premises to the appellant in 20015 and thereafter, unknown to

the appellant, has revoked the deed of gift on his own, before he

gifted it to the grandson on 26.11.2015.

4 Vide page 55 of the brief. 5 Vide the deed at page 320 of the brief.

11

Let me now refer to P50 and P53. P53 invoice6 goes to prove

that the private security firm employed a security officer to the

premises from 27.11.2015-30.11.2015. P50 affidavit7 has been

given by the security officer who was on duty when the appellant

stormed the premises on 01.12.2015. He states therein that he

came to the premises on 30.11.2015.

That means, private security guards had been employed from

27.11.2015-01.12.2015 only.

The learned Magistrate has come to the conclusion that the

appellant forcibly dispossessed the respondent on 01.12.2015,

which is within 2 months prior to the filing of the application,

because at that time the respondent had padlocked the premises

and employed a security officer to protect the premises. This is

a superficial way of looking at the issue.

It may be recalled that earlier the learned Magistrate came to the

conclusion that the appellant ran the business in the premises.

Thereafter the respondent, on 26.11.2015, gifted the premises to

his grandson and padlocked the premises and employed a

security guard. Why did the respondent padlock the premises

and employ a security guard? That was to prevent the appellant

from entering the premises. Then it is clear that, it is the

respondent who first dispossessed the appellant and padlocked

the premises within two months before filing the application.

The appellant has forcibly entered the premises five days after

such dispossession. The respondent filed the application on

09.12.2019. Under those circumstances, the respondent cannot 6 Vide page 356 of the brief. 7 Vide page 352 of the brief.

12

be granted the relief under section 68(3) on the basis that he

was dispossessed by the appellant within two months before

filing the application as it was the appellant who was in

possession of the premises before he was first dispossessed by

the respondent within two months immediately prior to filing the

application.

I set aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated 28.04.2016

and allow the appeal of the appellant with costs.
