Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an application filed by the police under section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979, over a dispute

between the 1st party appellant and the 2nd party respondent

regarding possession/cultivation of a paddy filed. The

Magistrates Court held with the appellant on the basis that it

was the appellant who was in possession of the paddy field when

the first information was filed in Court and the respondent has

not proved forcible dispossession within two months prior to the

filing of the first information.

This order was set aside by the High Court in revision, which,

relying on Mansoor v. OIC Avissawella [1991] 2 Sri LR 75, took

the view that as the dispute relates to the tenancy rights of a

paddy field, the Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction to make a

determination, and only the Tribunal set up by the

Commissioner General of Agrarian Services in terms of the

Agrarian Development Act, No. 46 of 2000, as amended, has

that jurisdiction. This appeal is from the said Judgment of the

High Court.

3

Mansoor v. OIC Avissawella [1991] 2 Sri LR 75 is based on the

well-established general principle that:

Where a statute creates a right and, in plain language,

gives a specific remedy or appoints a specific tribunal for its

enforcement, a party seeking to enforce the right must

resort to that tribunal and not to others.

The Agrarian Development Act is a special Act passed inter alia

to particularly resolve the disputes between landlords and

tenant cultivators of paddylands. Hence the jurisdiction of the

ordinary courts to entertain and determine such disputes are

ousted. Section 98 of the Agrarian Development Act enacts:

The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding

anything to the contrary in any other written law, and

accordingly, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency

between the provisions of this Act and such other law, the

provisions of this Act shall prevail.

The learned counsel for the appellant does not dispute the said

legal position. But her contention is that the Magistrates Court

lacks jurisdiction in such disputes only if both parties agree that

there is a landlord and tenant cultivator relationship between

them. As the appellant in this case does not accept the

respondent as a tenant cultivator under him, the counsel argues

that the Magistrates Court has jurisdiction to decide the matter

on possession, and therefore the Judgment of the High Court is

erroneous. Counsel cites Hearth v. Peter [1989] 2 Sri LR 325 in

support where it was authoritatively held that:

4

Any dispute in respect of a paddy field arising between a

landlord and a tenant would have to be determined in the

manner provided for in the Agrarian Services Act, and

cannot be brought before a Court of Law. However, the

above principle will apply, only where each party admits

the status claimed by the other, i.e. of landlord and tenant.

The jurisdiction of the Court is not ousted where the status

is denied.

I am in agreement with that submission.

The learned counsel for the respondent does not say that the

respondent is the tenant cultivator of this paddy land under the

appellant. Counsel says that the respondent was the tenant

cultivator of her brother, who was not a party to the case. The

respondent in her statement made to the police dated

03.11.20091 has clearly stated that she was the tenant

cultivator under Seneviratne Abeykoon (who is a relation of her)

until she was forcibly evicted from the paddy land by the

appellant in the last season. The respondent has also

particularly stated in the same statement that, in the last

season, it was the appellant who cultivated the paddyland.2

Then it is clear that:

a) there is admittedly no landlord and tenant cultivator

relationship between the appellant and the respondent,

and;

1 Vide pages 185-186 of the brief. 2 Vide 12th line from the bottom of page 186 of the brief.

5

b) the respondent was forcibly evicted by the appellant from

the paddy land in the last season, which was definitely

more than two months before the filing of the first

information in Court.

The respondent cannot be granted relief under section 68(3) of

the Act as the ouster has taken place more than two months

before the filing of the first information. The appellant is

therefore entitled to remain in possession under section 68(1) as

the one who was in possession on the date on which the fist

information was filed in Court.

One party in a section 66 application can claim to be a tenant

cultivator. It is a mistake to think that the moment such a

claim is made, the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is

instantly ousted. The jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court is

ousted, if, and only if, the two contesting parties in the first

place accept a relationship of landlord and tenant cultivator

between them. If one party denies it, the Court has the

jurisdiction to determine the matter. If the party claims to be a

tenant cultivator says that he is the tenant cultivator of someone

else who is not a party to the case, as in this case, the Court

definitely has jurisdiction to determine the matter between the

two parties before Court.

I must also add that when the Court decides that it has no

jurisdiction due to the relationship of landlord and tenant

cultivator being accepted, still, the Court has inherent

jurisdiction/power to order to maintain status quo until the

6

parities seek relief under the provisions of the Agrarian

Development Act.

The Judgment of the High Court dated 27.06.2012 is set aside,

and the Order of the Magistrates Court dated 28.06.2010 is

affirmed.

Let the parties bear their own costs.

Appeal allowed.
