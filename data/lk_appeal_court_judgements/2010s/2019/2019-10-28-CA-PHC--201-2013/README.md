Decided on: 25.10.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The appellant filed this appeal against the Judgment of the High

Court whereby the order of the Magistrates Court made in a

section 66 application filed under the Primary Courts Procedure

Act was affirmed.

There is no dispute about the identification of the disputed land.

Both the appellant and the respondent claim ownership to the

land.

It is common ground that ownership has no place in section 66

proceedings. What is material and crucial in such proceedings

is nothing but possession.

If I may repeat the applicable law in this regard in simple

language, the Judge trying a section 66 application shall first

consider who was in possession of the land on the date of filing

the case in Court and confirm his possession allowing the

opposite party to file a case in the District Court to vindicate his

rights to the land. (section 68(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act) However, if the aforesaid opposite party can

convince the Judge that, in fact, it was he who was in

possession of the land, but the party now in possession came to

such possession by forcibly evicting him within two months

immediately before filing the case, he shall be restored in

possession, allowing the other party to file a civil case in the

3

District Court to vindicate his rights to the land. (section 68(3) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act)

In the instant case, the appellant admits that this is a bare land,

and none of the parties are living on the land or in actual

physical occupation of the land.1

If that is the position, the order of the Magistrates Court in

favour of the respondent on the basis that the respondent was in

possession of the land on the date of filing the case, and forcible

eviction within two months prior to the filing of the case was not

established by the appellant, is correct.

The main item of evidence relied upon by the appellant contains

in the police observation notes (P2) whereby removal of old

concrete posts and replacement of them with new ones by the

respondent had been observed. However there is no evidence

that the old concrete posts were fixed by the appellant. The

respondent had lived on the land with his family. The wife and

the daughter have died due to a landslide, and thereafter the

respondent has gone abroad. According to the statement given

by the respondent (P3), upon his return to Sri Lanka, he has

gone to the land and cleared it. It has been so cleared as it was

not in the physical possession of anybody. Then the appellant

has told him that he bought the land from the father of his

deceased wife. It is in that background, this dispute has arisen.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, the conclusion

arrived at by the learned Magistrate and affirmed by the learned

High Court Judge is, in my view, correct.

1 Vide paragraph C(i) at page 7 of the written submission of the appellant dated 20.06.2019.

4

The order of the Magistrates Court is a temporary order, made

with the sole objective of averting any possible breach of the

peace out of this dispute, until the rights of the parties are

determined in a properly constituted civil case filed before the

District Court.

Nearly 8 years have passed since the delivery of the Magistrates

Court order. Had the appellant filed a civil case in the District

Court, soon after the Magistrates Court order, I am certain, by

now, the case would have been concluded. There is no point in

further clinging on the Magistrates Court order, if the appellant

is confident about his ownership to the land.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
