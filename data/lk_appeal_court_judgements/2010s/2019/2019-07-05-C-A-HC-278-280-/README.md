K.K.WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The accused-appellants filed the appeals bearing No. CA 278/2007, 279/2007 and

280/2007 seeking to set aside the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 14.12.2007 and orders of sentences dated 14.12.2007 and

17.12.2007 in Case No. HC. 2006/2004. All parties agreed to take up all three

appeals together and to abide by one judgment.

Facts of the case:

The Accused-Appellants were indicted in the High Court of Colombo under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of

1984. The indictment carried six counts as follows;

1. Count 01 - against the 1 st accused-appellant for possession of 1.290 kg of

heroin, an offence punishable under section 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the 'Ordinance')

2. Count 02 - against the 1 st accused-appellant for trafficking of 1.290 kg of

heroin, an offence punishable under section 54A (b) of the Ordinance

3. Count 03 - against the 2nd accused-appellant for abetting the pt accused-

appellant in trafficking of 1.290 kg of heroin, an offence punishable under

section 54 B of the Ordinance

4. Count 04 - against the 1 st and 3rd accused-appellants for possession of 7.796

kg of heroin Goint possession), an offence punishable under section 54A (d)

of the Ordinance

5. Count 05 - against the 1st accused-appellant for trafficking of 7.796 kg of

heroin, an offence punishable under section 54A (b) of the Ordinance

Page 30f43

6. Count 06 - against the 3rd accused-appellant for abetting the 1 st accused-

appellant in trafficking of 7.796 kg of heroin, an offence punishable under

se~tion 54B read with 54A (b) of the Ordinance.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted and

sentenced the accused-appellants as follows;

1. The 1 st accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the '1 st appellant') was

convicted of count No. 01, 02, 04 and 05.

2. The 2nd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the '2nd appellant') was

convicted of count No. 03.

3. The 3rd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the '3rd appellant') was

convicted of count No. 06.

Accordingly the 1 st and 2nd appellants were sentenced to death and the 3rd appellant

was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, all three appellants preferred appeals to this

Court. The appeals numbered CA 278/2007,279/2007 and 280/2007 were taken up

together in this Court.

The prosecution case

The prosecution called seven witnesses and marked productions from 'PI to P34B'

in the trial. The incident was narrated by the prosecution as follows;

Police Sergeant Rajitha received information regarding a drug dealer on

27.11.2003 from one of his informants and he had mentioned this to IP Liyanage

of Police Narcotic Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the 'PNB '). Accordingly IP

Liyanage arranged a team of officers to report to PNB on 28.11.2003 in order to

conduct a raid. On 28.11.2003 early morning, the informant came to the PNB and

Page 4of43

met IP Liyanage. [vol. 2 - page 770]. The informant disclosed that one Shiyam in

a house at Ward Place in Colombo was involved in trafficking of drugs with one

Upali. After discussion, 21 officers left the PNB in three vehicles at 0635hrs and

the vehicle driven by PCD Prasad carrying IP Liyanage, PS Rajitha, the private

informant, IP Nimal Perera, IP Tennakoon and PC Priyantha reached the particular

house in Ward Place around 7.1 Oam. The investigation team positioned in separate

places and had been watching the 1st appellant's house. IP Liyanage instructed the

team to be vigilant about a trishaw which was expected to be coming in order to

collect heroin.

IP Liyanage summoned SI Nalaka and PS 30762 Senaratne since they had some

knowledge of the 1 st appellant. IP Liyanage testified that he took such step as it

was necessary to identify the house, the trishaw and the 1 st appellant by someone

apart from the infonnant. [vol. 2 -pages 279, 281, 282, and 283]. The

investigation team observed a car bearing No. GG - 4488 driven by a female had

gone into the house around 8.10am. She was identified, by the informant, as the

wife of the 1 st appellant. Later around 8.30am it was observed that some garbage

was kept outside in the pavement [vol. 2 - page 64] and milk bottles were

delivered to house around 9.30am. The officers in a trishaw at the Wijerama

Mawatha then informed IP Liyanage of the arrival of the trishaw bearing number

GU-4308 which they were expecting [vol. 2- page 62]. The said trishaw came and

parked in front of the house of the 1 st appellant. The 2nd appellant got down from

the trishaw and proceeded towards the small gate carrying two black colour bags.

At that moment, the 1 st appellant came out from the gate and collected those two

bags from the 2nd appellant [vol. 2 - page 70]. Thereafter, the 1 st appellant returned

to the house and the 2nd appellant was waiting inside the trishaw. After about 10

minutes, 1 st appellant came back with a white colour bag.

Page 50f43

At this juncture, IP Liyanage walked towards the 1 st appellant and IP Tennakoon,

PC Priyantha and PS Mahinda too had quickly arrived at the scene [vol. 2 - page

74].

IP Liyanage searched the white colour bag at the pavement and found that there

was a Tulip type bag. Inside that bag was another black colour bag which

contained a transparent bag with a brown powder [vol. 2 - pages 74, 75]. IP

Liyanage identified the contents of the bag as heroin. Accordingly he arrested both

the 1 st appellant and the 2nd appellant.

Subsequently the officers went inside the house with both appellants. At this

juncture, IP Liyanage had told the 1 st appellant that the entire house would be

searched and if there was anything illegal to inform the officers before that. The 1 st

appellant responded by offering information that unauthorized drugs were in the

bag under a bed in a particular room [vol. 2 - page 79 & judgment 628].

Accordingly the officers entered to a room on the left hand side after passing the

main hall. The 3rd appellant was arranging clothes in an almirah in the said room.

Upon searching the room, the officers found a blue colour travelling bag under the

bed, in which they found 10 bags of heroin in a transparent bag, cash, few scales,

weights & an electronic scale [vol. 2 - pages 80, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91].

The officers searched the rest of the house but no other unauthorized drug could be

recovered. Thereafter the 3rd appellant was arrested and the team of officers

returned to the PNB on the same day.

Defence Version

After closing the prosecution case, an application under section 200 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act was made on behalf of the 2nd and the 3rd appellants. The

Page 6of43

said applications were rejected by the Learned High Court Judge and defence was

called from all three appellants.

Accordingly all three appellants made dock statements and following witnesses

were called on behalf of the 1 st and the 2nd appellants.

1 st Appellant

1. Maheegamala J ayathilaka

2. Ranasinghe Sembulage Sunil Fonseka

3. Kuragaha Wimalaratne - the Registrar of the Magistrate's Court of

Maligakanda

4. R.A. Priyantha Wijesiri De Silva (The Magistrate and the additional

District Court Judge)

2nd Appellant

1. Buhari Abdul Latheef

2. W. Sriyantha Ranjan Kumara

3. Buddhika Prasad Balachandra, OIC

4. PS P. Karunathilaka

The defence case was concluded after the dock statement of the 3rd appellant.

However the daughter of the 1 st and 3rd appellants was called as a witness to testify

in the inquiry that was held with regard to a video recording of the raid.

The incident narrated by the defence is as follows;

Defence witness Sunil Fonseka testified that on 27.11.2003 around 11.30pm one

Kelum and one Sanjeewa brought two black bags and put into a basin in the slums

near his house [vol. 3 - pages 270, 271, 272, 273]. A group of persons entered the

house of Sunil on 28.11.2003 in the morning around 4.30am and inquired whether

he got anything from Sanjeewa. Rajitha and Priyantha of Narcotic were said to be

Page 7of43

in the team [vol. 3 - page 275]. Sunil fonseka testified that Nimal Perera of

narcotic alleged to have come after about two minutes. Thereafter they searched

the house and recovered the two bags that were brought and placed by Sanjeewa

and the PNB officers alleged to have brought Sanjeewa too [vol. 3 - page 277].

Sanjeewa admitted the ownership of those bags. Thereafter they were taken to a

white van in which Kelum was and Sanjeewa requested the officers to release

Kelum since he admitted the ownership of bags. Accordingly, Kelum was dropped

off at Madampitiyajunction [vol. 3 - page 283].

The said witness Sunil Fonseka further testified that the team reached Slave Island

around 5.30 am and met IP Amarajith at his quarters at Slave Island. Both the IP

and Pujitha Jayasundera came to inspect the drugs. At that point, Kelum came in a

trishaw and spoke with IP Amarajith and Pujitha [vol. 3 - page 282]. It was further

testified that they were taken near the Dawatagaha Mosque and the PNB officers

blocked a trishaw and put the two bags into that trishaw [vol. 3 - page 284]. The

driver of the said trishaw was assaulted, hand cuffed and was made to sit at the

back of the van. After the alleged 'abduction' the van travelled up to Cary College

and IP Tennakoon got down at Cary College. Thereafter the van and the trishaw

proceeded to Ward Place and the van was parked near a house [vol. 3 - page 285].

Sunil fonseka further testified that a car was entering the house and Priyantha and

Bandara took two bags from the trishaw and went into the house at the same time

[vol. 3 - page 289].

Thereafter sunil and others waited for about 2 to 3 hours near the house at Ward

Place and some persons were videoing [vol. 3 - page 290]. After some time, the

van left Ward Place and they were dropped at Fort since Sanjeewa told IP

Tennakoon that they wanted to go home [vol.3 - page 291].

The Learned President's Counsel for all three appellants raised many questions of

law and grounds of appeal at the stage of argument. I will list them below as it was

submitted in the argument and in the written submissions.

For the 1st Appellant

1. Exclusion of video evidence

2. Flows in the 'chain' relating to the dispatch and receipt of productions to and

from the Government Analyst

3. Misdirection with regard to the burden of proof

4. Omission to permit production of the bed

For the 2nd Appellant

1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider certain items of evidence

that cast a doubt as to the credibility of the witnesses regarding the manner

in which the appellants were arrested

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider evidence favourable to the

defence that the IBs pertaining to this case maintained by the PNB were

tampered.

3. The video pertaining to the incident was unreasonably shut out by the

Learned High Court Judge.

4. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account that certain inter-

say contradictions occasioned a failure of justice

5. Evidence of Latheef, the three-wheeler driver who saw the incident of

abduction of the 2nd appellant was unreasonably rejected.

6. The Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the malice

demonstrated by the officers of the PNB

Page 9 of 43

7. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the role played by Chief

Inspector Amarajith

8. Defence witness Sunil Fonseka alias Patta's evidence was unreasonably

rejected by the Learned High Court Judge.

For the 3rd Appellant

1. Is there any evidence that the 3rd appellant was even present when the

alleged trafficking took place?

2. The prosecution did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 3rd

appellant had knowledge of the Heroin that was under the bed.

3. The presence of the 3rd appellant in the room in not sufficient to prove

knowledge

4. Was there a possibility that the 1 st appellant made use of the opportunity

when the 3rd appellant was not at home to commit these offences?

5. The subsequent conduct of the 3rd appellant cannot be used against her

for the conviction.

One of the main contentions for all three appellants was that a video of raid

should have been admitted in evidence and the non-admission of the video

caused a grave miscarriage of justice to the appellants.

It was the position of the defence that there was a video recording of the raid at the

residence of the 1st and 3rd appellants. One daughter of the 1st and 3rd appellants,

Shimran Shiyam, was called by the defence to prove that in fact the raid was video

recorded. They further submitted that said video was kept in the custody of the

PNB. Accordingly a video tape was produced from Police custody by OIC

Balachandra and it was marked as '2VIA'. However the Learned High Court

Judge did not allow it to be produced in evidence. The position of the prosecution

Page 10 of43

was that the productions that found in the raid were video recorded at the PNB by

PS Karunatilleke (Defence witness) [Vol. 3 -pages 471, 472]. Even PS

Karunathileke admitted that a video was made at the presence of OIC Amarajith,

but it was done at the PNB and not during the raid.

The Learned High Court Judge by order dated 28.02.2007, refused the application

of defence to produce the video as evidence since it was not admissible under

provisions of the Evidence (special provisions) Act No.14 of 1995. The defence

moved in revision to this Court, against said order of refusal by the Learned High

Court Judge, under case No. CA (PHC) 39/2007 (REV). This Court affirmed the

order of the Learned High Court Judge, and held that the video was not admissible

under section 4(2) of the Evidence (special provisions) Act No.14 of 1995 due to

the following reasons;

1. The evidence led by both the prosecution and the defense prove that

there was no contemporaneous recording of the raid.

ii. The evidence clearly establishes that whatever recording that was made

(filming the productions at the PNB) was not kept in safe custody at all

material times.

111. Insufficient precautions were taken to prevent the possibility of such

recordings being altered or tempered with (counsel for the accused have

admitted that they were in possession of such recording or parts thereof).

The Learned President's Counsel for the 2nd appellant contended that this court is

not bound by the decision of in case No. CA (PHC) 39/2007 (REV) since the said

decision was decided per incuriam. The rule of per incuriam is elaborated in

Halsbury's Laws of England (4th edition - vol. 26 - Judgments and Orders;

Judicial Decisions as Authorities) as follows;

Page 11 of 43

"a decision given when the court has acted in ignorance of a previous

decision of its own or of a court of coordinate jurisdiction which covered the

case before it, in which case it must decide which case to follow; or when it

has acted in ignorance of a House of Lords Decision, in which case it must

follow that decision; or when the decision is given in ignorance of the terms

of a statue or rule having statutory force". (Pages 297 & 298)

In the case of Morelle Ltd. V. Wakeling and another (1955) 2 QB 379, [1955]

1 All ER 708, it was held that,

"As a general rule, the only cases in which decisions should be held to have

been given per incuriam are those of decisions given in ignorance or

forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of of some authority

binding on the court concerned: so that in such cases some part of the

decision, or some step in the reasoning on which it was based, is found, on

that account, to be demonstrably wrong. This definition is not necessarily

exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can properly be held to

have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgment, consistently with the

stare decisis rule which is an essential feature of our law, be, in the

language of Lord Greene, MR., of the rarest occurrence. In the present

case it is not shown that any statutory provision or binding authority was

overlooked ... "

It is observed that the rule of per incuriam has been developed over a period of

time. Now it has been widened to include more instances like absence of citing

contrary authorities, failure to cite the relevant authorities, procedural errors,

failure to bring to the attention of court a manifest and obvious error of fact based

on an important item of evidence and etc. [vide C. Kodeswaran V. AG(1969) 72

Tissa Thero V. Liyanage Noris Jayasinghe -SC39/73 - SC Minutes 6/2/1976]

I am of the view that none of the above instances could be found in the judgment

of CA (PHC) 34/2007 (REV).

The Learned President's Counsel for the pt appellant submitted that this Court is

not precluded from considering the question of law as to whether, independent of

the Special Provisions, the evidence could have been produced under the primary

Evidence Ordinance. Accordingly it was contended that even though section 03 of

the Evidence Ordinance confines the definition of 'evidence' to oral or

documentary evidence, section 60 and 165 of the Evidence Ordinance empower

Court to permit the production of any 'material thing' or 'thing' respectively. The

Learned President's Counsel submitted following cases in support of this

contention;

1. Abu Bakar V. Queen [54 NLR 566]

2. Karunaratne V. The Queen [69 NLR 10]

3. Shaul Hameed and another V. Ranasinghe and others (1990) 1 Sri LR

104

4. King V. Dharmasena [50 NLR 505]

In the case of Abu Bakar V. Queen [54 NLR 566], Court admitted a recording of

a speech made at a public meeting under section 11 of the Evidence Ordinance

provided that it was correctly recorded and the machine was properly functioning.

It is noteworthy that as per the Court, in the said case, the prosecution adduced

evidence to the effect that the speech in question was in fact electrically recorded.

The Court in the said case observed that;

Page 13 of 43

"There was evidence before the jury, about the working of the wire

recorder, upon which it was open to them to hold that the instrument could

accurately record a speech and reproduce it ," and there was also evidence

that it was operated on the occasion in question by a police sergeant so as to

reward on a particular spool of wire (PI) almost the entirety of a speech

made by the appellant and the whole of another speech that immediately

preceded it and also the announcements that were made by the chairman of

the meeting before these two speeches. According to Wijesena's evidence the

speech that he took down purported to be one made by a person who was

announced as Abu Bakr. The police sergeant who had operated the

instrument at the time of the speeches gave evidence to the effect that it was

he who operated it later to reproduce the sounds recorded on PI so that

Wijesena might take down the appellant's speech as reproduced end that he

identified the appellant's voice on that occasion. Another police sergeant,

too, gave evidence to the effect that he was present on both occasions and

that he too identified the voice that was reproduced as the voice of the

appellant. "

Therefore it is manifested that the accuracy of the recording was proved before the

Court in order to obtain the permission of the Court.

In the case of King V. Dharmasena [50 NLR 505], it was held that,

"The other matter on which Mr. Lekamge relied as misdirection was his

contention that the learned Judge allowed some photographs to be produced

in evidence. In considering the admissibility of these there are always two

questions to be met- competency, and materiality and relevancy. If the

photograph is an accurate and honest representation of the facts one then

comes to consider whether it is material and relevant, whether the matter

Page 14 of 43

pictured will genuinely and properly aid the Jury in determining the true

facts. If it passes both tests it becomes good evidence. A photograph comes

in as a part of the testimony; it is used to explain or make oneself intelligible

to a Judge; it is referred to in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance ... "

These cases amply demonstrate that even for this evidence to be admissible under

section 03 or section 11 of the evidence Ordinance, the party who produces such

evidence was required to prove its accuracy, competency and genuineness. It is

apparent that the Court was conscious to check whether such material passes the

relevant tests in order to be admissible as evidence. However in the instant case,

the prosecution constantly denied the raid being video recorded and even the

defence witness (PS Karunathilaka) testified that the video recording was done at

PNB, subsequent to the raid. At the same time, it is paramount to note that the

technology has been developed over the years and certainly a video or a

photograph can be edited to demonstrate a completely different picture than the

original. People or things in pictures and videos could be removed and/or inserted

using many types of editing apps and tools. Therefore the Learned High Court

Judge was correct in considering the possibility of tampering with utmost

importance as required in section 04 of the Evidence (special provisions) Act.

I observe that in the case of CA (PHC) 34/2007 (REV), the Court was of the view

that consequent to the enactment of Act No. 14 of 1995; any item relating to

contemporaneous recording should be subject to these evidentiary provisions.

Section 2 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act refers to the application of the

Act as follows;

"Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary the Evidence

Ordinance or any other written law the provisions of this Act shall be

applicable in respect of any latter provided for herein. "

Page 15 of 43

Therefore I am of the view that the appellants are not allowed to pick and choose

an advantageous section or a Statute for them to produce contemporaneous

recording when there is a clear provision to govern the same. In CA (PHC)

34/2007 (REV), Justice Imam held that,

"After the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act 14 of 1995 came into operation

admission of video recordings is solely governed under the provisions of the

said amendment"

It is observed that without fulfilling the conditions laid down in section 4, the party

proposing to produce the contemporaneous evidence cannot do so. Case law

decided prior to the enactment of Act No. 14 of 1995 would not be applicable to

the instant matter and it was correctly considered by the Learned High Court Judge

as well. Therefore the contention of the Learned President's Counsel for the 1st

appellant, independent of the Special Provisions the evidence could have been

produced under the primary Evidence Ordinance, should necessarily fail.

At this juncture it is noteworthy that even though the appellants appealed against

the judgment dated 28.02.2007 to the Supreme Court, it was withdrawn without

proceeding. The said judgment of CA (PHC) 34/2007 (REV) is now reported in

2007 Vol. 1 of the Sri Lanka Law Reports at page 276. Therefore the said

judgment remains unchallenged and is final in relation to the issue of 'video

evidence' in the instant case.

Accordingly the Learned ASG for the respondent averred the plea of 'res judicata'

as the issue of 'video evidence' has already been determined by a competent court

having jurisdiction and the parties being the same.

The Learned ASG submitted the case of Karunaratna V. Amarisa [1964] [66

NLR 567] in which it was held that,

Page 16 of 43

"The doctrine of Res Judicata, based on the two Latin maxims ''Nemo debet

vis vexari pro una et eadem causa" and ''Interest republicae ut sit jinis

litium", is a plea which bars subsequent action on the same cause of action

between the same parties on the ground that the matter has been judicially

determined and is a safeguard against unnecessary litigation over the same

matter. The doctrine operates when the following essentials are present;

1. There must be a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction

(Ibrahim Baay v. Abdul Rahim [1 (1909) 12 N. L. R. 177.]

2. There must be ajinaljudgment (Fernando v. Menika (2 (1906)

3 Bal. 115).

3. The case must have been decided on its merits (Annamalai

Chetty v. Thornhill 3 [3 (1932) 34 N. L. R. 381]).

4. The parties must be identical or be the representatives zn

interest of the original parties (Sivakolunthu v. Kamalambal [4

(79,53) 56 N. L. R. 52)).

5. The causes of action must be identical (Dingiri Menika v.

Punchi Mahatmaya 5 [5 (1910) 13 N. L. R. 59.])".

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge allowed the defence to lead evidence

to prove that the requirements of section 04 of the Act No. 14 of 1995 were

fulfilled. Accordingly an inquiry was held in which the defence listed 4 witnesses,

but only led evidence of the witness No. 01, namely Shimran Shiyam (daughter of

the pt and 3rd appellants). On 28.02.2007, the Learned High Court Judge made an

order refusing to allow the application of defence to produce the video as evidence.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned Trial Judge on the issue of video, they

challenged the said order by way of revision and this Court delivered its judgment

after a careful consideration of arguments made by the parties. The appellants

Page 17 of 43

appalled to the Supreme Court but did not maintain the appeal. They have

withdrawn the said application without reserving the right to file a fresh

application.

Considering above, I am of the view that if the order dated 28.02.2007 was

erroneous, the Supreme Court was the accurate Court to challenge it. We are not

inclined to re-consider an order given by this Court when it was not proven to be of

per incuriam.

The Learned President's Counsel for the pt appellant submitted that there were

flows in the 'chain' relating to the dispatch and receipt of productions to and from

the Government Analyst. It was argued that some of the seals of 'P 1 had been

broken when produced at the trial in the High Court. As per the evidence led by the

prosecution, SI Rajakaruna received the productions from IP Liyanage. At the

PNB, the productions were marked and were entered in the production register.

Thereafter those were sealed with the left thumb impression of the 1 st appellant, his

signature,date and the signature of IP Liyanage were placed on a white sheet of

paper which was attached to each of the productions. All these productions had

thereafter been handed over to SI Rajakaruna [vol. 2 - page 108] SI Rajakaruna

has confirmed that when he received the productions from IP Liyanage, all the

productions had been sealed [vo1.2 - page 553]. SI Rajakaruna had put the said

productions to a strong box and kept them in his personal custody [vo1.2 - page

561]. Thereafter on 02.12.2003, SI Rajakaruna had handed over the productions,

namely PR 96, 97, 98, 100, and 101 to the Assistant Government Analyst

Chandrani [vo1.2 - pages 560 - 564]. The Assistant Government Analyst was

called to testify as PW 09 and she testified that she took over the productions as

stated in the covering letter & the seals were intact [Vol.3 - page 68, 88].

In the case of Perera V. Attorney General (1998) 1 Sri. LR 378 it was held that,

Page 18 of43

"]t is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution

must prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from

proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been

no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till they

reach the Analyst. Therefore it is correct to state that the most important

journey is the inwards journey because the final Analyst report will be

depend on that. The outward journey does not attract the same importance. "

In light of above it is understood that the most important journey is the inwards

journey. Our Courts took up that position since the final Analyst Report will

depend on the inwards journey. In the instant case, it appears that the seals had

been intact until the Government Analyst's Department had received the

productions. Greater importance cannot be attached to any damages that would

have been caused to 'PI" in its outward journey to the court since it has no impact

on the prosecution case.

It was further contended for the 1st appellant that SI Rajakaruna had handed over

the parcel to one Chandrani Ukwatte at the office of Government Analyst and no

person by that name was called as a witness. Instead the prosecution called

Kokawela Pathiranage Chandrani who was an Assistant Government Analyst and

she had signed the Report [Vol.3 - Page 63]. Accordingly it was contended that

there is a gaping hole with regard to the chain of productions until the office of

Government Analyst.

I observe that SI Rajakaruna refers to the officer who issued the a document called

as 'eso@~(5;)V5' upon acknowledgement of the productions as Chandrani Ukwatte

and the Assistant Government Analyst, Kokawela Pathiranage Chandrani, testified

and corroborated that she received the productions by the PNB through SI

Rajakaruna. Thereafter she had compiled and signed a report which was marked

Page 19 of43

and produced by the prosecution as P 29. Further I observe that the Assistant

Government Analyst identified signatures in both those documents i.e. in the

'-OOo@)~(Qc5' and in the report to be that of hers.

The Learned ASG for the respondent brought to the attention of this Court that the

Learned Trial Judge had referred to the Assistant Government Analyst as

Chandrani Ukwatte and Ukwattage Chandrani when he analyzed the evidence of SI

Rajakaruna [Vol. 3- page 669]. The Learned Trial Judge had referred to the witness

as Kokawela Pathiranage Chandrani when he analyzed the evidence of the

Assistant Government Analyst [Vol. 3 - page 688]. Further it is noteworthy that

this question was not raised in the High Court and the Learned Counsel for the 2nd

and 3rd appellants did not cross-examine the said witness, the Assistant

Government Analyst. Accordingly the Learned High Court Judge held as follows;

"6-00 a5~a82:S) 2:S)JC5c5Je@)~ ea~ @)2:S)6t~ a5~a8~c5C) cp~J~

692)

Page 20 of 43

Therefore I am of the view that all these materials amply demonstrate that the

officer who acknowledged the productions and the one who subsequently analyzed

the productions to be the same.

The Learned President's Counsel for the 2nd appellant submitted that the Learned

High Court Judge failed to consider evidence favourable to the defence that the IBs

pertaining to this case maintained by the PNB were tampered. The Learned High

Court Judge also made order on 03.07.2006, directing that the IB concerned which

was in court custody by then to be sent to the EQD for examination and report on

six specific questions. The EQD report was never brought to court and was not

made a part of the case, nor is it found in the record. Therefore it was argued that

the EQD report which was of relevance to this case which ought to contain

material favourable to the appellants has been shut out by the Learned Trial Judge

and there is a reasonable doubt with regard to the truthfulness of the Prosecution's

case.

This question was raised during the trial and at the invitation of the prosecution,

the Learned Trial Judge had carefully examined the original IB and had made his

observations at pages 346, 513, 608, of the brief. He also ordered the IB to be kept

in the custody of court [Vol. 2 - page 346].

The Learned ASG for the respondent contended that the proposition of the defence

on alleged tampering of the IB should be negated since registers and Information

Books of the police officers are subject to supervision by supervising officers and

there is possibility of the Information Book being used by more than one officer of

the PNB. Therefore it was submitted that any alteration interleafing would quickly

be detected on inspections by supervising officers. I observe that IP Liyanage has

explained that the IB is used for several purposes [vol. 2- page 339, 340]. Further I

observe that the Learned Trial Judge had the opportunity of examining the IB and

Page 21 of43

therefore he was in a better position to decide on this issue than this Court.

Therefore I do not interfere with his finding that the issue of IB is only an

imagination and has no bearing on the case for the prosecution [V 01.3 - pages 654

& 655]

The Learned President's Counsel for the 3rd appellant submitted that the

prosecution did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 3rd appellant had

knowledge of the Heroin under the bed and her presence in the room is not

sufficient to prove knowledge. It was argued that the 3rd appellant was not in home

at the time of the alleged trafficking and therefore she had no knowledge. The

Learned President's Counsel further submitted that the 3rd appellant being a

Muslim woman was under the command of her husband (the 1 st appellant).

The Learned President's Counsel submitted following case law and I list some of

them as follows;

1. V. Sivadasan & V. Pavadasan V. The Attorney General [CA 46/2008

decided on 13.07.2012]

2. The Queen V. M.G. Sumanasena [66 NLR 350]

3. Muniratne and others V. The State (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 382

4. Jaharlal Das V. State of Orissa [1991 SC 1388]

5. Dunuwila V. Poola [40 NLR 412]

6. Sumithra Premarathne V. Republic of Sri Lanka (1998) 3 Sri L.R. 342

I perused the above decisions and in the case ofV. Sivadasan & V. Pavadasan V.

The Attorney General [CA 46/2008 decided on 13.07.2012], two brothers were

arrested when they were coming out from a Kovil and the 1 st accused carried a

parcel alleged to have contained heroin. The 2nd accused did not have anything in

his possession. The High Court Judge convicted both accused persons for

Page 22 of 43

possession and trafficking of heroin. However the conviction of the 2nd accused

was set aside by the Court of Appeal. It was held that,

"The evidence fell short of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the 2nd

accused-appellant had the knowledge of the contents of the parcel and that

he deliberately attempted to rescue the pt accused-appellant and the parcel

of heroine. The evidence falls very short of proving beyond reasonable doubt

that the accused had been engaged or attempting to traffic heroine ...

With regard to the 2nd accused-appellant I must emphasize that although he

was coming out of the Kovil with the pt accused appellant. He was not in

possession of the parcel of heroine. On the other hand Kovil was a public

place and the 2nd accused-appellant was the brother of the 1st accused -

appellant. Therefore they had a right to. be together and there was nothing

unusual about that ... "

It is noteworthy that unlike in the V. Sivadasan case, the 3rd appellant was not in a

public place but in their own bedroom. Therefore I am of the view that the 3rd

appellant cannot completely deny knowledge about the things inside their room.

As per the dock statement of the 3rd appellant, she is a daughter of a doctor and had

studied up to the Advanced Level examination [Vol.3 - page 511]. She drives their

children to and from school and takes them for tuition as well. She further stated

that she helps children with their homework of school. This evidence amply

demonstrates that the 3rd appellant is an educated person and quite independent

lady compared to traditional Muslim women in the society. As per the dock

statement and the evidence of her daughter, the 3rd appellant had gone marketing

with their servant Sinniah Thirumurthi alias Kannan on the date of raid [vol. 3 -

page 512, 564]. She freely moves about, deals with the society and unlike other

Page 23 of 43

traditional Muslim women, she even accompanies male servants to go out when

necessary.

In the said Dunuwilla case (supra) both husband and wife were convicted of the

same offence, possession of toddy and the wife was acquitted in the appeal.

However in the same case it was held that,

There can, no doubt, be cases where a wife occupying a house with her

husband, may be held to be in possession of something that is the subject

matter of an offence.

Upon perusal of the said decision, it is understood that Soertsz, A.C.J did not

intend to create a solid rule that every wife must be free of liability with regard to

the restricted or prohibited materials that are found inside a house occupied by both

husband and wife. Further I observe that the facts of Dunuwilla case and the instant

case are different and therefore it is not justifiable to apply the same rules in a way

that would create an absurdity. The Learned ASG for the respondent contended

that unlike the wives in cases of Dunuwila (supra) & Samaraweera V. Bee Bee [4

CLW 48], the cases cited by the Learned President's Counsel for the 3rd appellant,

she was very much in a position of control. I perused the said judgments and I wish

to answer the said contention of the Learned ASG in affirmative. It is noteworthy

that family relationships have been developed to an extent where both husband and

wife are in equal positions than it used to be in 1940's when most of the submitted

cases were decided.

In the instant case the 3rd appellant was convicted of abetting the 1 st appellant as

well. Section 54B of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs reads that;

"Any person who abets the commission of or who attempts to commit or

does any act preparatory to or in furtherance of the commission of any

Page 24 of 43

offence under section 54A shall be guilty of such offence and shall be liable

on conviction to the punishment provided for such offence. "

In WORDS AND PHRASES legally defined1, 'aid and abet' was defined by case

law as follows; I

" ... Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that

a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission

of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be

expected to prevent it and had the power so to do, or at least to express his

dissent, might, under some circumstances, afford cogent evidence upon

which a jury would be justified in finding that he willfully encouraged, and

so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the jury whether

he did so or not ... " R V. Coney (1882) 51 LJMC 66 at 78, CCR, per

HawkinsJ

'I ... repeat what I said, with the assent of the other members of the Court, in

Johnson v Youden {{1950J 1 All ER 300J "a person cannot be convicted of

aiding and abetting the commission of an offence if he does not know the

essential matters which would constitute the offence". If a person shuts his

eyes to the obvious, or perhaps, refrains from making any inquiry where a

reasonably sensible man would make inquiry, I think the court can find that

he was aiding and abetting' Davies, Turner & Co Ltd. v Brodie (1954J 3 All

ER 283 at 286, per Lord Goddard CJ"(Emphasis added)

Section 100 of the Penal Code reads that;

"A person abets the doing of a thing who-

Firstly- Instigates any person to do that thing; or

1 John B Saunders, WORDS AND PHRASES legally defined, YoU, 3rd Edn., London Buttersworth, 1988, p. 64

Page 25 of 43

Secondly- Engages in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing; or

Thirdly- Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of

that thing. "

In light of above it is understood that even non-action would amount to aiding and

abetting in certain circumstances.

The Learned President's Counsel for the 3rd appellant submitted that there are three

possibilities when the alleged quantity of heroin could have been brought in to

appellant's house as alleged by the prosecution i.e.,

I. The heroin could have been brought in to house a day before the raid

2. The heroin could have been brought in to house before the 3rd appellant left

the house to drop children to school

3. The heroin could have been brought in to house after the 3rd appellant left

the house to drop children to school and before the PNB officers arrived at

Ward place at about 7.IOam.

In the case of The Queen V. M.G. Sumanasena [66 NLR 350], it was held that,

" ... Suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does the proof of

any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its

burden of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt

and compel the accused to give or call evidence... The burden of

establishing circumstances which not only establish the accused's guilt but

are also inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution

throughout the trial and is the same in a case of circumstantial evidence as

in a case of direct evidence.

Facts of that case are not much clear but it dealt with burden of proof.

Page 26 of 43

At this point the Learned ASG for the respondent raised the following argument. I

wish to reproduce it as follows;

"According to IP Liyanage, the house had been searched but drugs had not

been found at any other place in the house except from the bed room of the

1 st and 3rd appellants. Shimran Shiyam, the daughter of the 1 st and 3rd

appellants, corroborated that the room in issue to be the bed room of her

parents. This shows that the 1 st and 3rd appellants had kept the drugs and

accessories in their safe custody including the sales proceeds. The 3rd

appellant who returned from her morning drive was in the bed room when

the PNB officers walked in with her husband the 1 st appellant. As submitted

earlier, having collected the two bags from the 2nd appellant, the 1 st appellant

had taken about 10 minutes to re-appear. He was not empty handed but

carried a bag containing drugs. Thus, it is evident that the 1 st appellant had

collected the drugs from the room where the 3rd appellant was present and is

a clear indication of the knowledge of the 3rd appellant of the contents of the

bag that was securely stored under their bed."

In the case of Jaharlal Das V. State of Orissa [1991 SC 1388], it was held that,

"The Court must satisfy itself that the various circumstances in the chain of

evidence should be established clearly and that the completed chain must be

such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the

d " accuse ...

In the case of Warner V. Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1968) 52 Cr.

App.R.373, (1969) 2 A.C.256, it was held that,

"the section did not contain the word 'knowingly' Pollock C.B said that

section 3 applied to the case 'whether the party knows it or not' Parke B.

Page 27 of43

said at p. 417; 'with respect to the offence itself, I have not the least doubt

that the ordinary grammatical construction of this clause is the true one. It

is very true that in particular instances it may produce mischief, because an

innocent man may suffer from his want of care in not examining the tobacco

he has received, and not taking a warranty; but the public inconvenience

would be much greater, if in every case the officers were obliged to prove

knowledge. They would be very seldom able to do so

" ... the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real

doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no

right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were

drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of

(including a genuine mistake as to ) its actual contents or of their illicit

nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had no

reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself

with its actual contents ".

The 3rd appellant in the instant case was not a servant and she was in a position to

control the affairs at home. Unlike the wives in some of the cases submitted by the

Learned President's Counsel, the 3rd appellant was in a better position to be aware

of her husband's actions as demonstrated above. As it was observed in the Warner

case (supra) the omission of 'knowledge' in the relevant section should also be

considered at this juncture. Therefore I wish to answer the above contention of the

Learned ASG in affirmative. Further I observe that her abetment in trafficking

could be inferred from the fact that the bag containing heroin was stored right

under the bed which was inside the room she occupied. Even at the time of

detection, she was occupying the said bedroom. This question was correctly

evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 84 to 87 [Vol.

Page 28 of 43

3 - pages 700 - 703] Therefore the grounds of appeal, 01 to 04, raised by the

Learned President's Counsel for the 3rd appellant should fail.

Both the Learned President's Counsel for the 1 st and 2nd appellants submitted that

the Learned High Court Judge failed to take into account that certain inter-say

contradictions occasioned a failure of justice. They contended that there had been

misdirection with regard to the burden of proof. It was further contended that the

Learned High Court Judge failed to consider certain items of evidence that cast a

doubt as to the credibility of the witnesses regarding the manner in which the

appellants were arrested. The Learned President's Counsel for the 2nd appellant

contended that evidence of Latheef, the three-wheeler driver who saw the incident

of abduction of the 2nd appellant and the evidence of defence witness Sunil

Fonseka alias Patta's were unreasonably rejected by the Learned High Court

Judge.

The defence witness, abdul latheef, had known the 2nd appellant for about 6

months. According to him some people had come in a white van on 28.11.2003

around 9.30am and had pointed a pistol at the 2nd appellant and thereafter had

pushed him to the rear seat of the trishaw [vol. 3- pages 405, 406, 407]. However

the Learned ASG for the respondents submitted that said witness Latheef

contradicts defence witness Sunil who testified that the 2nd accused was assaulted,

hand cuffed and was put into the van [vol. 3 -page 285]. It is noteworthy that said

Latheef did not even inform the police about the alleged abduction that had taken

place in broad day light. At this point, the Learned High Court Judge considered

how Latheef was able to note down the trishaw number of the 2nd appellant given

that the white van was going behind the said trishaw. Accordingly the Learned

High Court Judge was of the view that the version of the Latheef was questionable

and not creditworthy.

Page 29 of43

Defence witness Sunil testified that he made a confession to the Magistrate of

Maligakanda under case number 31198. The reason for the statement was an

alleged threat he had received during his period of remand. However, as per

section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 statements or

confessions can be made only during the stage of investigation. Even the Learned

Magistrate under cross-examination admitted that he was misdirected in recording

the said confession since he was not legally empowered to do so. Therefore the

Learned High Court Judge was correct in rejecting the evidence of Sunil Fonseka

since it was a well-planned move in making him to be a competent witness for the

defence.

It was contended that IP Amarajith became angry with the 1st appellant since he

refused to pay Rs. 25,00,0001=as requested by said IP Amarajith. This incident had

happened in 1993 [vol. 3 - page 248] whereas the detection was in 2003. In this

regard, the Learned ASG for the respondent raised the question as to if Amarajith

had wanted to put the 1 st appellant in trouble, would he have waited for 10 years to

do that? I do not think so. Further there is a doubt as to whether the PNB officers

would have done a 'staged detection' as alleged by the defence, in front of three

eye witnesses, i.e. Sunil, Sanjeewa and Kelum as mentioned earlier.

I observe that the Trial Judge has considered the opportunities available for the

appellants to have complained against the illegal arrest as alleged by them.

Accordingly it was observed that despite their claim of non-involvement in

unauthorized possession and trafficking of drugs, they had not complained about it

to any authority. I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was correct in

considering the failure to file Fundamental Right applications by the appellants to

the Supreme Court given that they had the ability to obtain the services of senior

Page 30 of43

experienced legal practitioners for the instant case. Therefore I see no merits in this

argument raised by the Learned President's Counsel for the 2nd appellant.

It was argued for the appellants that the Learned High Court Judge failed to

consider the physical impossibility of retrieving the travel bag allegedly contained

heroin under the bed. IP Liyanage described bed found in this room was to be a

large bed [vol. 2 - page 78] and PS Rajitha explained the bed to be larger than a

single size bed [vol.2 - page 800] and to be a luxury type [vol.2 - page 1040]. The

size of the bag that was found under the bed was about 2 Yz feet long and 23 inches

in width. The height was about 10 inches. At the PNB this bag had been marked as

S 16 and was included in PR 98 [vol. 2 - page 188 & 190] and it was marked as P4

in the High Court Trial. IP Tennakoon had pulled the bag out from the handle

[vol.2 - pages 326, 801, 1021, 1037, and 1048]. It was suggested to IP Liyanage

under cross examination that the gap between the floor and the bed was only 6

inches in view of a plank that was fixed to the bed. This fact was categorically

denied and refuted by IP Liyanage the chief raid officer. The Learned ASG for the

respondent brought to the attention of this Court that in the dock statement of the

3rd appellant, she stated that sequel to the cross examination of IP Liyanage on the

issue of the bed, she happened to measure it on the same day at home and it is a

mystery as to how the defence counsel knew the details and dimensions of the bed,

which the 3rd appellant was unaware of.

A bed was brought to court by the defence, when PS Rajitha was giving evidence

and was marked and produced as 1 V12, but Rajitha could not clearly identify it to

be the same bed [vol.2 - pages 1044, 1045]. The Learned High Court Judge

considered the effort of the defence to challenge the finding of the bag underneath

the bed and was of the view that the defence failed to produce any evidence in

establishing the bed to be the same bed that had been in the bed room of the house

Page 31 of 43

I

I

of 1 st and 3rd appellants [vol. 3 - judgment pages 757, 758]. Therefore I see no

merits in this argument of the appellants.

The Learned ASG for the respondents submitted that there is no evaluation and

finding by the Learned Trial Judge on Count 4 against the 3rd appellant and

therefore pleaded to convict the 3rd appellant on count 4 and that she be sentenced

as provided by the Statute. I observe that the Learned Trail Judge had omitted to

enter a finding on the said 4th count. This issue was pointed out by the Learned

ASG earlier and therefore the Learned President's Counsel was allowed to make

submissions on this point and even filed written submissions to that effect. The

appellants are invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 138(1) of the

Constitution read with section 331 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This Court is

vested with the appellate jurisdiction to correct all errors in fact or in law

committed by the High Court inter alia as per Article 13 8( 1) whereas Article

139(1) of the Constitution stipulates that in exercising its appellate powers, this

Court shall affirm, reverse, correct or modify any order, judgment, decree or

sentence according to law. Furthermore, section 335 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 lays down the powers exercised by this Court in

determining the appeals in cases where trial was without a jury.

The Learned ASG submitted cases of Emperor V. Jagannath Gir and others

AIR 1937 All 1937 and Ragunath and others V. Emperor AIR 1933 All 565,

145 Ind Case 849, where the Indian courts have entered a conviction when the

trial judge has omitted to do so. In Ragunath and others V. Emperor (supra) it

was held that,

"The ruling goes further than is necessary for the purpose of the present

case where there is no express acquittal under Section 147 but merely an

omission to record a conviction under that section. This ruling was followed

Page 32 of 43

by a Single Judge of this Court in Emperor v. Sardar (1912) 34 All 115 Here

it was held that an appellate Court can under Section 423, Criminal P.e., in

an appeal from a conviction alter the finding of the lower Court and find the

appellant guilty of an offence of which the lower Court has declined to

convict him ... "

Therefore it was held that the High Court, under section 423 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, (corresponding provision in Sri Lankan Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, section 335) is empowered to convict the accused

under section 147 of the Indian Penal Code inasmuch there was no acquittal on the

charge under that section.

In the case of Ambilrn Prasad and another V. State (Delhi Administration)

(2000) SCC Cri. L 522 the Indian Supreme Court observed that,

'a criminal trial is meant for doing justice to the accused, victim and the

society so that law and order is maintained. A judge does not preside over a

criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A judge also

presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the

other. Both are public duties ... "

As I have already evaluated above, the prosecution has proved that the 3rd appellant

had the knowledge of heroin being stored inside the house and therefore she was in

joint possession of heroin together with the 1 st appellant. Upon consideration of

evidence, it is manifested that the 3rd appellant was on par with her husband.

Therefore exercising the powers vested in this Court in terms of Article 138 and

139, I convict the 3rd appellant for the 4th count i.e. for possession of 7.796 kg of

heroin Goint possession), an offence punishable under section 54B read with 54A

of the Ordinance.

Page 33 of 43

Another argument raised on behalf of the appellants was that the Learned High

Court Judge misdirected with regard to the burden of proof and failed to consider

certain inter-say contradictions which resulted in a failure of justice.

Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance reads that;

"Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or

liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that

those facts exist.

When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the

burden of proof lies on that person. "

Section 102 of the Evidence Ordinance reads that;

"The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would

fail if no evidence at all of were given on either side. "

In the Sarkar on Evidence2, the burden of proof is elaborated as;

"The phrase 'burden of proof' is not defined in the Act. It has two distinct

and frequently confused meanings; (1) The burden of proof as a matter of

law and pleading - the burden, as it has been called of establishing a case.

This burden rests upon the party, whether plaintiff or defendant, who

substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue. It is flXed at the beginning

of the trial by the state of the pleadings, or their equivalent, and it is settled

as a question of law, remaining unchanged under any circumstances

whatever. This rule is embodied in s 101. (2) The burden of proof as matter

of adducing evidence. The burden of proof in this sense is always unstable

and may shift constantly, throughout the trial, according as one scale of

In The Law of Evidence3, it was emphasized that;

" ... A party asks for a judgment on the basis of a legal right or liability. The

substantive law lays down the requirements of that right or liability. He must

prove the existence of all facts which bring him within the substantive law on

that subject. The burden of proof lies on him [Dickinson vs. Ministry of

Pensions 919530 1 QB 228; (1952) 2 AER 1031 at 1033; Hoffmann &

Zeffertt, op. cit., 3rd Ed., 396J ...

Section 101 is based on the rule, ei incumbit probation qui dicit, non qui

negate Lord Maugham has said, "it is an ancient rule founded on

consideration of good sense and should not be departed from without strong

reasons [Joseph Constantine Steamship Line Ltd. vs. Imperial Smelting

Corp. Ltd (1942) A.C. 154; (1941) 2 A.E.RI 165; see also Soward vs.

Leggatt (1836) 7 C. & P. 613J"

In the case of Ajith Samarakoon V. The Republic [2004] 2 SLR 209, it was held

that,

'The principle laid down in R V. Cochrane and R V. Burdette do not place a

legal or a persuasive burden on the accused to prove his innocence or to

prove that he committed no offence but these two decisions on proof of a

prima facie case and on proof of a highly incriminating circumstances shift

the evidential burden to the accused to explain away the highly

incriminating circumstances when he had both the power and the

opportunity to do so '

3 E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, The Law a/Evidence, Vol. 2, Stamford Lake Publication, 2018, p.

Page 35 of43

I '

In light of above, it is understood that in certain instances such as when a prima

facie case is proved with highly incriminating evidence, the burden of proof shifts

to the other party i. e. the accused and he is required to explain it in view of the

power and opportunity he has. If the accused is able to create a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution case, then he must be acquitted. However in the case of Abdul

Sufan & Ors V. State of Tripura [2010] Cri. L.J. 805 (813), it was held that,

"Reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely possible doubt, but

a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense ... "

Now I wish to consider whether such burden was discharged by the prosecution

and whether the appellants were able to create a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case.

There were two types of charges under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance were leveled against the 1 st appellant i.e. firstly unauthorized possession

of 1.290 kg of heroin (Count 1) and unauthorized possession of7.796kg of heroin

(with 3rd appellant for count 4) and Secondly, trafficking the respective quantities

(Counts 2 & 5). The 2nd appellant had faced a single charge of abetment i.e.

abetting 1 st appellant to traffic 1.290 kg of heroin (Count 3). The 3rd appellant had

faced a charge of unauthorized possession (Count 4) of 7. 796kg of heroin along

with the 1 st appellant and for abetting the 1 st appellant to traffic the same quantity

(Count 6).

Page 36 of43

1 I.

As per the evidence, the first quantity of 1.290kg of heroin was found in the

exclusive possession of the 1 st appellant when he was on the pavement in front of

his house at ward place. The 2nd appellant arrived at the house of the 1 st appellant

in the trishaw bearing registered number GU-4308 and there were two black bags

in this vehicle. The 2nd appellant had handed over the said bags to the 1 st appellant

and thereafter waited in his trishaw until the 1 st appellant reappeared carrying the

aforementioned white bag with 1.290 kg of drugs inside.

In the case of R V. Looseley [2001] UKHL 53; 1 Cr. App.R.29 HL, it was held

that,

"a drug dealer will not voluntarily offer drugs to a stranger unless the

stranger first makes an approach to him, and the stranger may need to

persist in his request/or drugs be/ore they are supplied ... "

As per the evidence, it is clear that the 2nd appellant was abetting the 1 st appellant

in trafficking heroin and the 1 st appellant would not have brought the restricted

drugs to the pavement unless he knew the 2nd appellant. Therefore the Learned

Trial Judge was correct in drawing an inference on the fact that the 2nd appellant

was abetting the 1 st appellant.

Further it is imperative to note that monies of different denominations such as Rs.

1,000/=, Rs. 500/=, Rs. 200/=, Rs. 100/=, Rs. 50/=, Rs.20/=, Rs.I0/= totaling up to

Rs. 5,18, 850/= was found in the bag that was found under the bed. The Learned

ASG for the respondent raised questions as to why a businessman having cash at

his residence, would keep it in a traveling bag with heroin and different scales and

weights?

In the case of R V. Wright [1994] Crim. L.R. 55, 16,000 British pounds (cash)

were recovered from the flat of the accused. It was held that,

Page 37 of43

"The question for decision is whether the finding of such a large amount of

cash is a fact which, if proved, makes it more probable that a person

suspected of dealing in narcotic drugs, and who is found to be in possession

of them, is in possession of them for the purpose of supplying them ... no

doubt that the finding of a large quantity of cash is capable of being relevant

to an issue the jury had to consider in the case, and we reject the submission

that this evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant '. Uollowed in

R V. Grant (1996) 1 CR.App.R 73]

I observe that it is quite suspicious as to why the 1 st appellant had collected small

denominations and kept such collection of denomination at home. At the same

time, I observe that the pt appellant never denied that Rs. 5,18,8501= had been

recovered from his house and he did not challenge either the recovery of money or

the recovery of different scales and weights from his house.

In the case of State of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri.L.J.

1694 at 1701, it was held that,

"Whenever a statement of fact made by a witness is not challenged in cross

examination, it has to be concluded that the fact in question is not disputed,

absence of cross examination of prosecution witness of certain facts leads to

inference of admission of that fact ... " [vide Motilal V. State of Madhya

Pradesh (1990) Cri. L.J. NOC 125 MP]

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge correctly

held that the transactions between the 1 st and the 2nd appellant too proved that the

1 st appellant was involved in trafficking of heroin and the 2nd appellant was

abetting him for the same.

In the case of The Attorney General V. Devunderage Nihal [S.C. Appeal No.

154/10 - decided on 12.05.2011], it was observed that,

It is a well-established principle that the prosecution is not required to lead

the evidence of a number of witnesses to prove its case. In a similar case as

the present instance, Jayasuriya J in A.G. v Mohamed Saheeb Mohamed

Ismath C.A.87/97 Decided on 13.7.1999 stated that "There is no

requirement in law that evidence of a Police Officer who has conducted an

investigation into a charge of illegal possession of heroin, should be

corroborated in regard to material particulars emanating from an

independent source. Section 134 of Evidence Ordinance states that "No

particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of

any fact. The principle had been applied in the Indian Supreme Court where

the conviction rested solely on the evidence of a solitary witness who gave

circumstantial evidence in regard to the accused's liability. The Privy

Council upheld the conviction entered by the trial Judge and adopted the

Judgment of the supreme court in Muulluwa v State of Madhya Pradesh

AIR 1976 S.C.198. This principle has been adopted with approval and

applied in the judgment of G.P. S. Silva J. in Wallimunige John v The State

76 NLR 488. King v N.SA. Fernando 46 NLR 255. The principle affirmed

is that testimony must be weighed and not counted. Justice Vaithylingam

dealing with a bribery charge laid down for the future legal fraternity the

principle that even in a bribery case, that there is no legal requirement for a

sole witness's evidence to be corroborated. No evidence even of a police

officer who conducted a raid upon a bribery charge is required by law to be

corroborated. Gunasekera vA. G. 79 NLR 348".

In the case of Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [SC Appeal

79/2008 - decided on 06.05.2010] it was observed that,

'" demeanour represents the trial judge's opportunity to observe the witness

and his deportment and it is traditionally relied on to give the judge's

findings of fact their rare degree of inviolability ... "

In the case of The AG V. Potta Naufer and others (2007) Sri L.R. 144, it was

observed that,

, When faced with contradictions in a witness's testimonial, the court must

bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions, viwed in light

of the whole of the evidence given by the witness'

It is imperative to note that the Learned High Court Judge had the opportunity of

hearing the evidence of the whole trial and had the opportunity of observing the

demeanour and deportment of both prosecution and defence witnesses.

In the case of Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka [2010] 2 Sri LR 241, it was

held that,

"Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge. Court of

appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of trial Judge with regard to the

credibility of a witness unless such findings are manifestly wrong. This is

because the trial Judge has the advantage of seeing the demeanour and

deportment of the witness ... "

In the case of State of UP V. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48], it was held that,

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

Page 40 of43

4 '" ,

court to scrutinise the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief Minor

discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there

from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed

by the investigating officer not going to the : root of the matter would not

ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before

whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion

about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation

of evidence by the trial court and unless there are reasons weighty and

formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of

minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details ... "

In light of above, it is observed that undue importance cannot be attached to minor

contradictions and discrepancies unless they create a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case. Our Courts have recognized the right of an accused to make an

unsworn statement from the dock and a dock statement is capable of creating a

'reasonable doubt 'in the case for the prosecution. However as held in Queen V.

Buddharakkitha Thero 63 NLR 433 and in many other judgments, the analysis

and evaluation of dock statements ought to be subjected to the tests like test of

consistency, test of probability and test of deliberate falsehood. [vide King V.

Vel/ayan 20 NLR 257, Queen V. Kularatne 71 NLR 529J

Page 41 of 43

II ,

In the case of Queen V. Kularatne (supra), it was held that,

"when an unsworn statement is made by the accused from the dock, the

jurors must be informed that such statement must be looked upon as

evidence, subject however to the infirmity that the accused had deliberately

refrained from giving sworn testimony. But the jury must also be directed

that (a) if they believe the unsworn statement it must be acted upon, (6) if it

raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the prosecution,

the defence must succeed, and (e) that it should not be used against another

accused. "

It is observed that dock statements lack evidentiary value compared to sworn

evidence. In the instant case, there were contradictions between the dock

statements of the three appellants. I observe that the 1 st appellant said he

accompanied 3rd appellant to the market on that day but the 3rd appellant said she

went to the market with a male servant. Further the 1 st appellant said that he saw

the large traveling bag was brought into the main hall and drugs being packed into

it whereas neither the 2nd appellant nor the 3rd appellant stated such thing.

Therefore I observe that the Learned High Court Judge came to the correct

conclusion, after evaluating the evidence, that the defence did not create a

reasonable doubt and the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt

against all three appellants.

Before concluding, I wish to remark on the assistance given to this Court by all the

Learned Counsel in both parties by tendering comprehensive written submissions

and tendering copies of decided cases.

After considering the arguments raised by both parties and perusing the evidence

available, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge arrived at the correct

conclusion by convicting all three appellants for respective charges leveled against

Page 42 of43

" ~

them. As mentioned earlier, I convict the 3rd appellant for the 4th count and

accordingly sentence her to life imprisonment. Subject to the above variation, I

affirm the findings against each appellant dated 14.12.2007 and the orders of

sentences imposed on all three appellants dated 14.12.2007 and 17.12.2007 by the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appeals bearing No. CA 278/2007, 279/2007 and 280/2007 are hereby

dismissed without costs.
