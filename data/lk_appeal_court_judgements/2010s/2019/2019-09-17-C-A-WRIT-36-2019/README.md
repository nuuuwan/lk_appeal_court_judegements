Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 9th July 2019

Decided on: 1 ih September 2019

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner states that pursuant to an application submitted by him, and

having faced an interview, the Director General of the Road Development

Authority (RDA) had informed the Petitioner by letter dated 1 ih September

2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P2' that he "has been selected for

appointment as the Director (Administration) (Special Grade) in the Road

Development Authority with immediate effect." The final paragraph of 'P2' also

stated that" a formal letter of appointment will be issued to you after assuming

duties and submitting certified copies of your certificates mentioned in the bio-

data".

The Petitioner had immediately informed this to his then employer CNNC

London Private Limited that he would be resigning from his post of Director of

Administration and Academics and accordingly his resignation had been

accepted with effect from 18th November 2018. The Petitioner had thereafter

informed the RDA that he would be assuming duties on 1 i h November 2018,

2

which had been acknowledged by the RDA. However, by a letter dated 5th

November 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P6', the Acting Director

(Administration) of the RDA, on behalf of the Director General had informed

the Petitioner that "the Management of the RDA has decided to suspend your

appointment with immediate effect." 'P6' was followed by letter dated 7th

November 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P7' by which the Petitioner

was informed that "the letter of appointment dated 1th September 2018

issued to you for the above post is hereby cancelled."

The Petitioner states that he nonetheless reported to the RDA on 19th

November 2018 and was handed over a letter dated 13th November 2018,

annexed to the petition marked 'pg', addressed to him, informing him as

follows:

"This has reference to your letter dated 8th November 2018 on the above

subject.

Your attention is drawn to my letter of even number dated 07.11.2018

cancelling the selection of you to the post of Director Administration of

this Authority w.e.f 07.11.2018.

I was campelled to make the decision of cancellation, due to the findings

of the investigation conducted by Internal Audit Division of this Authority

on the allegation made against you. The investigation was conducted on a

complaint received from a trade union of this Authority. In the complaint

serious allegations have been revealed against you and for selecting you

for the post.

3

In the process of Audit Investigation it was proven that you have been

interdicted from service on 14.11.2017 while serving in the Fisheries

Corporation as General Manager and after applying for the post of

Director Administration in this Authority. This has not been revealed to the

RDA by you. The disciplinary inquiry against you is reported to be still in

progress.

Subsequently you have resigned from the Fisheries Corporation and joined

CNNC London Pvt. Ltd. Company.

Your previous employer Ceynor Foundation Ltd. too has terminated your

contract appointment on 02.10.2015 due to the charges of

insubordination and immoralness according to the letter issued by General

Manager of Ceynor Foundation dated 31.10.2018.

Considering the misconducts connected in your career history revealed in

the investigation and according to the rules ond regulations applicable in

the Authority, decision was taken to cancel the selection of you to the post

of Director Administration of the Authority. ..

As such I regret to inform that your request cannot be reconsidered."

The above circumstances t hat led to the issuance of 'P6' and 'P7' have been

explained in an affidavit submitted to this Court by the Director General of the

RDA. He has stated that after issuing 'P2', complaints had been received that

the Petitioner was unsuitable for appointment. The RDA had accordingly called

for a report from the Cey-Nor Foundation Limited where the Petitioner had

4

been employed from 28th July 2014 to 3'd November 2015. The reply, which

has been annexed to t he said affidavit marked 'R4' contained the following:

The RDA had also obtained a clarification from the Ceylon Fisheries

Corporation where the Petitioner had been employed from 2nd November

2015 to 14th November 2017 which had by its reply marked 'RS' stated that,

"@Elj(;,6JlEl&ll Q$Qlai(;)@oo 2017.11.14 El6J ~6J El~c) tllG>eD tl>O q~tll. ~ Q$Ql~

Although this Court has referred to the above docu ments, this Court must

state that the Petitioner has disputed the accuracy of the above facts. This

Court does not intend to go into the accuracy of the factual circumstances that

led to the issuance of 'P6' and 'P7', nor is it the role of this Court to decide on

disputed facts in an application of this nature.

Aggrieved by the decisions contained in 'P6' and 'P7', the Petitioner filed this

application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions of the

Respondents contained in documents 'P6' and 'P7'. It was the position of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the grounds relied on to issue the said

letters were factually incorrect and that in any event the said letters do not

contain any reasons.

During the course of her submissions, the learned State Counsel submitted

that according to the Petitioner, the purported dispute before this Court arises

5

out of a contract of employment. The fact that the Petitioner has come before

this Court on the basis that he has a valid contract of employment flowing from

'P2' is clear when one considers the averments in paragraphs 30 and 32 of the

petition . It was her position that the jurisdiction of this Court to issue writs of

Certiorari, conferred under Article 140 of the Constitution, is limited, inter alia

to an examination of the legality of a decision of a public body exercising a

public or statutory function, and that this jurisdiction cannot be extended to

examine rights and obligations arising from a private contract, even though

one party may be a public authority. This is an objection that goes to the root

of this application and in the event the said objection is upheld by this Court,

the necessity for this Court to consider the grounds urged by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner does not arise.

In considering the sa id objection, it would perhaps be appropriate for this

Court to first of all consider the approach adopted by the Supreme Court and

the Court of Appeal in this regard.

In Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and

another' a Writ of Certiorari was sought to quash the termination of an

agreement between the petitioner and the Board of Investment. The

respondents raised a preliminary objection that the petitioner was seeking

relief based on a breach of a contractual right and therefore the petitioner

cannot maintain the said application.

Having considered the underlying facts, this Court had held as follows:

1 (2002) BLR 10

6

"An analysis of the relationship that existed between the parties reveals

that as it was purely a contractual one of commercial nature, neither

certiorari nor mandamus will lie to remedy the dispute over the rights of

the parties. The purported breach of such rights (and) the grievances

between the parties, arise entirely from a breach of contract, even if one

of the parties was a statutory or public authority,,2

This Court went onto consider if the fact of the Board of Investment being a

statutory authority would lend to the commercial arrangement between the

parties, a statutory flavour, thus enabling the petitioner in that case to invoke

the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Having taken into consideration the fact that

even though the power to enter into a contract arises from the statute, the

terms and conditions between the parties were entirely contractual, and that

the decision that was sought to be quashed was purely contractual, this Court

held as follows:

"Therefore, the exercise of powers by parties in terms of the agreement,

exclusively arises through the contract and though one of the parties is a

public authority, rights of the parties are not amenable to writ

jurisdiction.',3

A similar view has been expressed by this Court in De Alwis v Sri Lanka

Telecom and Others 4 where a writ of Certiorari had been sought to quash the

decision to disconnect the telephone connection of the petitioner on the basis

of non-payment of charges. The Court, while refusing the writ held as follows:

2 Ibid. page 1l.

3 Ibid. page 12

4 (1995) 2 Sri LR 38

7

"The decision sought to be quashed is a decision founded purely on

contract. The telephone was disconnected for failure to settle the

outstanding bills as provided for in the agreement. This was a decision

taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship between

the parties and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority.

Neither Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie to remedy the grievances arising

from an alleged breach of contract."s

This Court will now consider whether the position would be any different if the

underlying contract is a contract of employment. The answer is found in the

judgment of this Court in Gawarammana v Tea Research Board and others6

wherein Sripavan J (as he then was) had cited with approval the following

passage of Thambiah J in Chandradasa v Wi;eratne7.

"No doubt the competent authority was established by Statute and is a

statutory body. But the question is, when the respondent as competent

authority dismissed the petitioner, did he do so in the exercise of any

statutory power?

The Act does not deal with the question of dismissal of employees at all. It

does not specify when and how an employee con be dismissed from

service - the grounds of dismissal or the procedure for dismissal. So that,

when the respondent made his order of dismissal, he did so in the exercise

of his contractual power of dismissal and not by virtue of any statutory

power.

5 Ibid. page 41

6 (2003) 3 Sri lR 120.

7 (1982) 1 Sri lR 412 at 415 - 416.

8

If the petitioner's dismissal was in breach of the terms of the employment

contract, the proper remedy is an action for declaration or damages. The

Court will not quash the decision on the ground that natural justice has

not been observed."

Sripavan J thereafter held as follows:

"The powers derived from contract are matters of private law. The fact

that one of the parties to the contract is a public authority is not relevant

since the decision sought to be quashed by way of Certiorari is itself was

not made in the exercise of any statutory power."s

Thus, whether a contract is entered for com mercial purposes or for

employment purposes, where such contract has no statutory nexus or where

the act complained of does not arise in the exercise of a statutory power, such

contract would be outside t he scope of the Writ jurisdiction of this Court.

In Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others vs Dayanthi Dias Kaluarachchi

and others9, four former employees of the CPC who had retired from service

on 31st December 2002 upon obtaining the compensation package offered

under a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), complained to the Court of Appeal

that they were not paid arrears of the salary revision granted to the remaining

employees of CPC consequent to a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated

2th August 2003, and that their legitimate expectation had been frustrated by

the said decision. On an appeal filed by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

against the judgment of this Court which had issued a Writ of Mandamus

8 Ibid. page 124

9 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19" June 2019. Judgment of M.N .B.Fernando, J.

9

directing the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to make the said payment, the

Supreme Court, having considered whether the circular offering the VRS had a

statutory flavor, held as follows:

"There was no material placed before this Court to substantiate that the

VRS was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on the request of the

Minister, as stated in the judgment. The circular P5 by which the VRS was

offered, issued under the hand of the Chairman/ Managing Director of

CPC clearly stated that the VRS is offered by the Management with the

concurrence of the General Treasury in view of the award of financial

emoluments. Therefore, the attempt to sanctify the circular P5 to the level

of a statutory duty of CPC, in my view has no merit and is erroneous.

Similarly, circular P6 which covered incidental matters too was not issued

as an exercise of power under section 7(1) of the CPC Act. The terms and

conditions in the said circular does not have a statutory flavor or a

statutory underpinning as stated in the judgment and on that ground tao,

the judgment is erroneous.

P5 is simply a circular issued in the course of contract of employment, by

the employer offering a voluntarily retirement. The employees were free

to accept or reject the VRS. P5 circular dated 15.10.2002 clearly spelt out

the termination package, compensation to be calculated at two months'

salary for each year of service and one-month salary for balance years of

service until the age of retirement and emoluments to be calculated upon

the last drawn salary, i.e. salary of December 2002. This is the offer that

was accepted by the 1500 employees as a full and final settlement and

emoluments based on the last drawn salary. Vide 1R5 to 1RB. The

respondents voluntarily accepted the compensation as a full and final

to

settlement based upon the last drawn salary and terminated their

contracts of employment and retired from service. Any dispute pertaining

to the terms of VRS is contractual and does not fall within the scope of

writ application. Thus, no relief can be granted by a writ court based upon

legitimate expectation or otherwise.

The relationship between the CPC a public corporation and its employees

is entirely contractual and has no statutory flavour. In a plethora of

Appellate Court decisions, it has been held that matters pertaining to

contracts of employment does not come within the realm of writ

applications."

The Supreme Court, having cited the findings of this Court in Gawarammana's

caselO, held that the judgment of this Court is erroneous as the relationship

that existed between the parties was contractual.

This Court will now consider if the position would be different where the RDA

is concerned. The RDA has been established by the Road Development

Authority Act No. 73 of 1981. While Section 12 of the Act provides for the

appointment of a Director General, Section 13(1) of the Act reads as follows:

10

"The Authority may, subject to the other provisions of this Act:

(a) appoint, dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over such staff as

may be deemed necessary by the Authority to carry out the functions

of the Authority;

Supra.

11

(b) fix the wages or salary or other remuneration of such staff;

(c) determine the terms and conditions of the service of such staff; and

(d) establish and regulate provident funds or schemes for the benefit of

such staff and make contributions to any such fund or scheme."

Although Section 13 empowers the RDA to recruit staff, it does not create a

statutory nexus to each and every contract of employment that the RDA may

enter into. The said power must be viewed as a provision that enables the RDA

to carry out the functions assigned to it by the Act. The position of Director

(Administration) is not a post that is provided for in the Act itself and therefore

has no statutory link or nexus. Furthermore, 'P6' and 'P7' were not issued in

the course of exercising any statutory function. Thus, this Court is of the view

that 'P6' and 'P7' have been issued in the course of its contractual rights and

not in the exercise of any statutory power conferred on the RDA.

This Court must refer at t his stage to the judgment of this Court in Jayasuriya

vs Consumer Affairs Authority and othersll where t he Director General of the

Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) challenged the decision of the Authority to

terminate her services. Section 52(1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act

provided for the appointment of a Director General, and it was submitted on

behalf of the petitioner that her "employment is a statutory function or should

be considered as a function having such a flavour, in contrast to the ordinary

relationship of master and servant." It was the position of the CAA that the

services of the petit ioner were terminated in terms of the contractual rights

that the CAA exercised and enjoyed over the petitioner and not in terms of any

11 CA (Writ) Application No. 1590/2006; CA Minutes of 20" November 2008.

12

provision of the CAA Act. Having considered the position of both parties, this

Court held as follows:

"As has been contended by the learned State Counsel, on the line of

authorities cited by him, the pertinent question is, in dismissing the

petitioner, was the Authority exercising statutory powers or authority

derived from contract of employment? It is quite apparent that the

procedure under which the Director General can be removed, has not been

specified anywhere in the Act. Even the period of time during which the

Director General shall hold office is determined not by the statute but by

the letter of oppointment. Unlike in the case of the Chairman and certoin

other members of the Board no protection has been afforded to the post

under consideration against arbitral dismissal. Since there is no special

statutory provision either direct or by a necessary implication suggesting

the manner in which the Director General should be removed from office

or underpinning the position of Director General by restricting the freedom

of the Authority to dismiss, in my opinion, the public law rights are not

available to the petitioner."

The above judgment fortifies the view that this Court has already expressed.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner brought to the attention of this Court

the judgment of this Court in Neidra Fernando v Ceylon Tourist Board and

others12 where this Court has taken a view contrary to those expressed in the

aforementioned judgments. In that case, the petitioner had been dismissed

from service based on the findings of an inquiry report. Although the petitioner

12 (2002) 2 Sri LR 169 at 178. This judgment was followed by the same Bench in Sirigampola vs Board of Investment [(2002) 2 Sri LR 1021

13

had subsequently been reinstated in service, the petitioner had indicated her

desire to continue with the case in order to quash the findings contained in the

report. This Court has examined the said judgment and it appears that this

Court was heavily influenced by the fact that there existed a report containing

findings adverse to the petitioner, which required to be set aside. This is borne

out by the following passage:

"Anyhow, as had been repeatedly pointed out above -no Court or

tribunal other than a Court exercising judicial review functions can

quash the report of the 3,d respondent recommending the ultimate

punishment of dismissal of the petitioner. This consideration, that is,

the non-availability, of any other means of quashing or challenging

the report of the 3,d respondent injects an element of public law into

the issue and should make the relevant report, one amenable to

judicial review."

While it is factually incorrect to state that the findings of a report cannot be

challenged in any other forum, this Court is not in agreement that judicial

review becomes available to a petitioner just because he or she has no other

means of quashing a report. With all due respect, that by itself does not inject

an element of judicial review into the issue. The said reasoning fails to take

into consideration the basic proposition that any disciplinary findings stems

from the power of disciplinary control that an employer may exercise over an

employee in terms of the contract of employment. If the source of the power is

cont ract ual and not statutory, a public law remedy would not be available. In

these circumstances, this Court prefers to follow the judgment of this Court in

14

Gawarammana's13 case, which has been cited by the Supreme Court in Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation vs KaluarachchL'4

In the above circumstances, this Court agrees with the submission of the

learned State Counsel that the purported complaints of the Petitioner are

entirely contractual and that the Petitioner therefore cannot invoke the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court. Hence, it wou ld not be possible for this Court to

entertain the application of the Petitioner, irrespective of the strength of the

factual arguments. This Court accordingly refuses to issue notice on the

Respondents and dismisses this application, without costs.
