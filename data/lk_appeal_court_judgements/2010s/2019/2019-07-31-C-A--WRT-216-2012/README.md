Respondentss

The Petitioners are former employees of the 1st Respondent, Vallikamam North Mallakam

Pradeshiya Sabha and employed in the electrical undertaking carried on by the 1st Respondent.

This undertaking was vested in the 2nd Respondent Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) at which point

the Petitioners were absorbed as employees by the 2nd Respondent. This application was filed by

the Petitioners while so employed and they seek the following reliefs:

(a) A mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari to quash the specific condition in the award

of pensions granted to the Petitioners the right to receive their pension only upon their

retirement from the Ceylon Electricity Board,

Page 3 of8

(b) A mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus compelling the 3,d Respondent to award

pension to the Petitioners with effect from date of absorption into the Ceylon Electricity

Board.

There is no dispute between the parties that the Petitioners were absorbed to the CEB in terms

of section 33 of the Ceylon Electricity Board (Amendment) Act No. 32 of 1988 (Act). As the learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General correctly submitted the dispute between the parties is on the

consequences of absorption under section 33 of the Act which reads:

"33. Upon the vesting in the Board, under section 20, of an electrical undertaking carried on by a local authority, the following provision shall apply to the officers and servants employed exclusively in such undertaking, on the day preceding the vesting date and who are either

(a) not offered employment in the Board or in any local authority. (b) who are offered and do not accept such employment.

(1) Every such officer or servant who is a member of the Local Government Service and who had reached the age of fifty-five years on the vesting date shall be deemed to have retired from such local authority on that date shall be eligible for such pension under the Local Government Service Pension Regulations as would be awarded to him on such retirement. (2) The post of every such officer or servant who is a member of the Local Government Service and who had not reached the age of fifty-five years on the vesting date shall be deemed to have been abolished with effect from that date and such officer or servant shall be eligible for such pension or other award under the Local Government Service Regulations as would have been awarded to him had he retired from such local authority on that date on the ground or abolition of post. (3) Every such officer or servant who not being a member of the Local Government Service and is a member of any other pension scheme established by such local authority and who has reached the age of fifty-five years on that date shall he deemed to have retired from such

local authority on that date and shall be eligible for such pension under such scheme as would be awarded to him on such-retirement. (4) The post of every such officer and servant not being a member of the Local Government Service and is a member of any other pension scheme established by that local authority and who has not reached the age of fifty-five years on the vesting date shall be deemed to have been abolished with effect from (hat date and such officer or servant

Page 4 of 8

shall be eligible for such pension or other award under such scheme as would have been awarded to him had he retired from such local authority on that date on the ground of abolition of post. (5) Every such officer or servant to whom the preceding provisions of this section do not apply shall be deemed to have retired from such

local authority on the vesting date and shall be eligible for the payment of a gratuity of such amount as may be determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister in charge of the subject of Local Government, having regard to his period of service in such local authority. ".

The contention of the Petitioners is that they are entitled to both a salary and pension

concurrently from the date of absorption. They contend that they have a legitimate expectation

to do so in view of the following judgments:

(1) S.c. (F/R) Application No. 503/1992

(2) C.A. Writ Application No. 2241/2004, 2242/2004 and 143/2010

The learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on the decisions in R. v. Secretary of State for the

Home Department, ex parte Khan [(1980) 2 AII.E.R. 337, (1980) 1 W.L.R. 569J, Thirimavithana v.

Urban Development Authority [(2010) 2 SrLL.R. 262 at 296J and Judicial Review in Public Law,

Clive Lewis, page 97.

Legitimate Expectation

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [(1985) A.C. 374, 408-9J Lord

Diplock stated that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decision:

"must affect [theJ other person ..... by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which

either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he

can legitimately expect to be permitted continue to do until there has been

communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been

given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-

maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons

for contending that they should not be withdrawn." (emphasis added)

Page 5 of8

Such legitimate expectations may arise where a public authority has made a clear, unqualified

and unambiguous representation to a particular individual that it will act in a particular way. The

burden is on the individual to demonstrate that an unqualified, unambiguous and unqualified

representation was made [Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th Ed., 248 (South Asian

Edition)J.

The terms of the representation by the decision-maker must entitle the party to whom it is

addressed to expect, legitimately, one of two things:

(a) That a hearing or other appropriate procedure will be afforded before the

decision is made. (Procedural Legitimate Expectation); or

(b) That a benefit of a substantive nature will be granted or, if the person is already

in receipt of the benefit, that it will be continued and not be substantially varied.

(Substantive Legitimate Expectation)

Ultra Vires Representation

An ultra vires representation should not be binding on the body which made it as it would entirely

destroy the whole doctrines of ultra vires and separation of powers which are related. In

Robertson v. Minister of Pensions [(1949) 1 K.B. 227J Lord Denning used the doctrine of estoppel

to give relief to an individual who had relied on an unlawful representation. However, the House

of Lords in Howell v. Falmouth Boat Construction Co. [(1951) A.C. 837J disapproved of Lord

Denning's remarks relating to an ultra vires assurance and its legal consequences.

In Regina v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, Ex Parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents Ltd. and others

[(1990) 1 WLR 1545 at 1573J Judge J. states:

"No legitimate expectation could arise from an ultra vires relaxation of the relevant

statute by the body responsible for enforcing it."

Page 6 of 8

The principle that the court will not give effect to a legitimate expectation where to do so would

involve the decision-maker acting contrary to law is fundamental [Attorney-General oj Hong Kong

v. Ng Yuen Shiu [1983] 2 AC 629 at 638; R. v. North and East Devan Health Authority, Ex parte

Coughlan (2000) 2 WLR 622 at 647, 651, 656; R v. Secretary oj State Jar Education and

Employment, Ex parte Begbie (2000) 1 WLR 1115 at 1125, 1132)].

In Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) Ltd. vs. Director General oj Customs [(2005) BLR 24] the

Supreme Court held that the representation must be intra vires for there to be a legitimate

expectation.

In the cases relied on by the learned counsel for the Petitioners it appears that certain

settlements have been arrived at based on the opinion of the Hon. Attorney General. This opinion

itself is not before Court. In any event it is only a legal opinion and not binding on this Court. The

Constitution only guarantees equal protection of the law and not equal violation of law. One

illegality does not justify another illegality [CO W. Mackie and Co. Ltd. v. Hugh Molagoda,

Commissioner General oj Inland Revenue and Others (1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 300 at 309].

In my view the Petitioners are not entitled to both a salary and pension concurrently from the

date of absorption. In terms of section 33 of the Act, sections 33(1) to (5) apply only to officers

and servants employed exclusively in an electrical undertaking carried on by a local authority,

who were on the day preceding the vesting of such undertaking in the 2nd Respondent Board:

(a) Not offered such employment in the 2nd Respondent Board or in any local authority,

(b) Were offered such employment and did not accept such employment.

The Petitioners do not admittedly fall within this category.

In any event, the specific condition in the award of pensions granted to the Petitioners the right

to receive their pension only upon their retirement from the CEB is not before Court. In

Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National Housing Development Authority and Others [CA.

Application No. 866/98, C.A.M. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the court will

not set aside a document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the

Page 7 of 8

prayer to the petition. I am in respectful agreement with these dicta and hold that the prayer for

a writ of certiorari in the petition is defective.

It is trite law that to issue a writ of mandamus there must be a public or statutory duty. [De Alwis

v. De Silva (71 N.L.R. 108); Weligama Multi Purpase Cooperative Society Ltd. v. Chondradasa

Doluwatto (1984) 1 SrLL.R. 19S; Hakmana Multi Purpose Cooperotive Society Ltd. v. Ferdinondo

(198S) 2 SrLL.R. 272; Piyasiri v. Peoples Bank (1989) 2 SrLL.R. 47; Sannosgola v. University oJ

Kelaniya (1991) 2 SrLL.R. 193 and Samoroweero v. Minister oj Public Administrotion (2003) 3

SrLL.R. 64]. There is no such public or statutory duty compelling the 3rd Respondent to award

pension to the Petitioners with effect from date of absorption into the Ceylon Electricity Board.

Therefore, a writ of mandamus as prayed for by the Petitioners cannot be issued.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application without costs.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is observed that the Petitioners will, upon retirement from the

2nd Respondent Board, be entitled to a pension for the period of service in relation to the 1st

Respondent which will be in addition to the retirement benefits which the Petitioners will be

entitled to as employees of the 2nd Respondent Board.

On 10.07.2019, the parties in CA. (Writ) 217/2012, CA. (Writ) 218/2012, CA. (Writ) 219/2012,

CA. (Writ) 220/2012, CA. (Writ) 221/2012, CA. (Writ) 222/2012, CA. (Writ) 223/2012 and CA.

(Writ) 302/2012 agreed to be bound by the judgment in this application. Accordingly, all those

applications are dismissed without costs.
