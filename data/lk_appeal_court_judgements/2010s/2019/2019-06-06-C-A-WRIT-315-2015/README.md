Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner has filed this application against the Ceylon

Electricity Board seeking to quash P9 by certiorari and restore

him in the position which he was prior to P9 by mandamus.

It is my considered view that the reliefs prayed for by the

petitioner are misconceived in law and therefore this application

is bound to be dismissed in limine on that threshold ground

alone.

The petitioner cannot straightaway come before this Court

against P9 decision without first preferring an appeal to the

Appeal Board as provided for in the Disciplinary Code marked

P18. That is on the basic principle that when there is an

effective alternative remedy writ does not lie.

The petitioner did in fact go before the Appeal Board and the

Appeal Board did partly revise P9 decision by Appeal decision

marked P13.

However the petitioner in these proceedings seeks to quash P9

which has receded to the background upon Appeal decision P13

being made.

What the petitioner shall challenge is not P9 decision but P13

decision.1

The mandamus sought is also redundant because if P9 is

quashed, status quo ante would automatically prevail without

any further order.

1 For instance, before the Supreme Court, a party shall challenge the Appeal Court decision and not the District Court decision.

3

Application is dismissed without costs.
