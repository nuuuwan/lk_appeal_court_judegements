Dr. Sunil Coorey with Buddhika Gamage and Previ Karunaratne for the Petitioner

Zuri Zain, SSC with Nayomi Kahawita, SC for the AG

The Petitioner seeks three remedies in this application for judicial review;

l. A writ of certiorari against the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) quashing its

order dated 18.12.2012 in the Appeal bearing No.AA T/32/2012.

2. A wtit of certiorari quashing the order made by the Public Service Commission

(PSC) dated 26.12.2011.

3. A writ of mandamus compelling and/or directing the 4 th Respondent and/or added

Respondents to the post of Class III in the Sri Lanka Teachers Education Service

(SLTES) with effect from 09.11.2008 with all privileges attached thereto.

The gravamen of this application is traceable to the rejection of the Petitioner'S application

to join the Class III of the SLTES. Having joined the teaching service as a Grade 3-(1)

teacher on 03.05.1993, the Petitioner was promoted to Grade I and during her tenure as a

teacher, she served as a teacher in several schools. When she made the application to join

the SLTES, she had the following educational qualification;

2

..

a) Master of Science degree in Science Education awarded by the University of

Peradeniya on 13.12.2004.

b) Bachelor of Science (2nd Class Honours) degree awarded by the University of

Kelaniya on 01.08.1995.

c) Postgraduate Diploma in Education awarded by the University of Colombo on

OL02.1998.

d) She was following a Postgraduate Diploma in Information Technology at the

University of Kelaniya, which was later awarded to her on OL06.2009.

The Petitioner applied to become a member of the SL TES in response to an advertisement

that had been published in the Gazatte dated 09.09.2005 by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education (5th Respondent) calling for applications for the recruitment of Officers of Class

III. The Petitioner applied for a post of Class III Officer in the SLTES in the subject of

Mathematics.

Prior to 09.09.2005 the date of the advertisement, SLTES had been established by its

constitution (or service minute) which was published in Gazette Extraordinary No.1070!l3

dated 1L03.1999.

The said service minute in clause 12, sets out the qualifications necessary to be appointed

to a position in post of Class III of the SLTES. There are six such requirements. The first

three of them are;

i. that the applicant be a citizen of Sri Lanka;

ll. that the applicant be of good character, in good health, and be prepared to serve

any part of the country;

iii. that the age at the time of the application for appointment be not less than 22

years and not more than 30 years.

These three requirements were set out in clauses 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 respectively in the

advertisement published by the 5th Respondent in the Gazette dated 09.09.2005.

3

It is relevant to highlight that the fourth, fifth and sixth requirements are all educational

requirements, and that they are in the alternative and it is sufficient for an applicant to

possess anyone of them. The fourth, fifth and sixth requirements are;

iv. the candidate should possess a first class or an upper second class degree in

education, or possess a higher degree in education;

v. the candidate should possess a degree in the relevant subject and a distinction or

credit pass in the post graduate diploma in education;

vi. the candidate should possess a fist class or second upper class degree in the

relevant subject and post graduate diploma, or degree in the relevant subject and

post graduate degree in education, with not less than 03 years of satisfactory

experience in teaching and should be less than 40 years of age.

These three requirements were set out in clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 respectively in the

advertisement published by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education in Gazette dated

09.09.2005.

As one could notice, the service minute does not itself discriminate in any way berween

the fourth, fifth and sixth requirements. If one looks at the qualifications set forth in

clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 of the advertisement one could not but notice that whilst clauses 6.1

and 6.2 refer to academic qualifications and academic achievements, clause 6.3 requires not

only academic qualifications but also an added qualification of practical experience as a

teacher for 3 or more years.

So one could see that the qualifications set forth in the service minute were replicated in

the advertisement put out by the Secretary, but he made an alteration. Although the

service minute does not itself in any way discriminate between the fourth, fifth and sixth

requirements, clause 8.4 of the advertisement stated that the vacancies will be filled, first

by interviewing and appointing the candidates who possess the alternative educational

qualifications under the fourth (alternative) and fifth (alternative) requirements (referred

to as the qualifications under clause 6.1 and 6.2 of the advertisement and if the vacancies

could not be filled by those candidates, the candidates who possess the sixth (alternative)

4

requirements (referred to as the qualification under clause 6.3 of the advertisement) will

be interviewed.

Dr. Sunil Coorey for the Petitioner contended that clause 8.4 purported to make an unfair

discrimination by making the candidates who are qualified under the sixth requirement

inferior to the candidates who were qualified under the fourth or fifth requirements.

Norwithstanding clause 8.4 of the advertisement, the candidates possessing the required

educational qualifications under all three alternative requirements were called for the

interviews at the same time. Hence, it is clear that the provision in clause 8.4 was not

followed in calling the candidates for the interview.

The Petitioner states that the service minute is a cabinet approved document. The 5th

Respondent has no power or authority to interfere with, alter or modify the manner in

which the service minute is to be given operation. Hence, the 5th Respondent had no

authority at the time she called for applications by advertisement published in Gazette

dated 09.09.2005, to have wrongly discriminated against the candidates because all of

them satisfied the requirements of the service minute.

It would appear that clause 8.4 of the Gazette of 09.09.2005 was ultra vires the powers of the

5th Respondent as it offended the service minute. What is ultra vires and void is void from

the outset and must be disregarded. It is the service minute that must be given effect to in

preference to the advertisement calling for the applications for appointments under service

minute-so submitted Dr. Coorey.

In fact, the clause 8.4 of the advertisement published in Gazette dated 09.09.2005 by the

5th Respondent purported to modify the manner in which the service minute was to be

given operation, [ would agree that clause 8.4 was ultra vires and void, and therefore the

appointments to Class III in SLTES should have been made in disregard of that clause 8.4.

It was contended on behalf of the Petitioner that though she possessed all the necessary

qualifications, she was deprived of the appointment on the basis that she had been placed

at number 12 whereas there were only 10 vacancies.

5

Though she was not selected for the said post despite having obtained 37 marks, seven out

of the ten selected candidates had obtained lesser marks than her such as marks 34 to 14.

Being aggrieved by this deprivation, the Petitioner preferred an appeal to the Secretary to

the Ministry of Education. By the letter dated 01.12.2008, the Petitioner was informed by

the Ministry Secretary that he (the Ministry Secretary) had forwarded the Petitioner's

appeal to the Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to as "the PSC").

Although her appeal was forwarded to the PSC, the PSC was not in operation at the time.

After the PSC was re-activated, the Petitioner was informed by the Secretary to PSC by a

letter dated 26.12.2011 that her appeal had been dismissed by the PSC on the ground that

the Petitioner had obtained the 12th position whereas there were only 10 vacancies.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal of the appeal, she filed an appeal to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) on or around 01.02.2012. Upon hearing the appeal,

the AA T delivered its order dated 13.12.2012, thereby dismissing the appeal of the

Petitioner.

It is against the decision of the AAT that the Petitioner has preferred this application

praying for inter alia:-

a) a Writ of Certiorari quashing the order of the AAT dated 13.09.2012 produced

marked as P11,

b) a Writ of Certiorari quashing the order made by the PSC dated 26.12.2011 produced

marked as P7;

c) a Writ of Mandamus compelling and/or directing the 4th Respondent and/or added

Respondents to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Class III in the Sri Lanka

Teachers Education Service with effect from 09.11.2008 with all the privileges

attached thereto.

It is quite clear that the Petitioner was not selected because of clause 8.4 which was to the

effect that the 10 vacancies would be filled, first by interviewing and appointing

candidates who possessed the alternative educational qualifications under the fourth

(alternative) and fifth (alternative) requirements (referred to as the qualifications under

6

clause 6.1 and 6.2 of the advertisement) and if vacancies could not be filled, only then those

under clause 6.3 would be considered.

The service minute did not have such a requirement and as I said before, clause 8.4 is

certainly ultra vires and both the PSC and AA T have rejected the appeals of the Petitioner.

The service minute is a Cabinet approved document in terms of Article 55e 4) of the

Constitution as amended by 17'h Amendment which was certified on 03.10.2001. The

Secretary to the Ministry acted ultra vires when he published the advertisement in the

Gazette of 09.09.2005 and enacted a Clause 8.4, which unfairly discriminated against the

candidates because all of them who had been called for the interview fulfilled the

requirements of the service minute.

The provision in clause 8.4 of the Gazette of 09.09.2005 was ultra vires the powers of the

Secretary to the Ministry as it offended against the service minute. It is the service minute

that must prevail over the advertisement calling for application for appointment under the

service minute.

The reason given by the PSC by letter dated 27.03.2012 was that though it emerged that

the Petitioner had obtained 37 marks when the marks were arranged according to

categories 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, she has become the 12th in the recommended list. This position

has come about because of the application of the wrongful provision in Clause 8.4.

According to this discriminatory provision adopted by the Secretary to the Ministry, the

Petitioner who had obtained 37 marks was placed even below the candidate who had only

obtained 14 marks.

When the marks scored at the interviews are examined, the Petitioner is ranked within

the first ten candidates and there being ten vacancies, she was clearly entitled to be

appointed to one of those vacancies.

Dr. Coorey argued quite strenuously that the Petitioner had been wrongfully denied

appointment to Class III in SLTES, merely because she came under a clifferent category of

qualifications, which according to the service minute had to be given the same status and

position as the candidates possessing qualifications under the other two categories. On a

7

careful consideration it is quite manifest that the Petitioner has been disadvantageously

treated and relegated to her peril. Despite this clear evidence of illegality, the PSC

proceeded not to hold in favor of the Petitioner and the question arises whether the

decision of the PSC is amenable to the writ jUlisdiction of this Court.

Article 6lA of the Constitution provides that subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3,

4, and 5 of Article 126, no court or tribunal shall have power to jurisdiction to inquire into,

or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made by the

Commission, Committee or any public officer, in pursuance of any power or duty

conferred or impose on such commission or delegated to a Committee or public officer

under this chapter or under any other law.

The constitutional ouster in Article 6lA precludes this Court from calling into question,

the validity of the decision of the PSC and I had occasion to comment on this provision in

Dr. MD. W Lokuge v. VidyajotlU Dr. Dayasiri Fernando and Others CA Writ

Application 160/2013 (CA minutes of 16.10.2015) wherein in the context of the availability

of Certiorarified Mandamus, I held that if PSC has acted and made a decision, the decision of

the PSC would be protected by the privative clause such as Article 6lA of the

Constitution. The constitutional ouster comes into play because the writ jurisdiction

vested in this Court is subject to constitutional ouster provisions such as Article 6lA. In

the circumstances, this Court would be slow to exercise its writ jurisdiction over the

decision of the Psc.

An appellate procedure was established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No.4

of 2002 against the decision of the PSC and this legislation contains a statutory ouster

clause in Section 8(2) to the following effect:-

"A decision made by the Tribunal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in

any suit or proceedings in a court of law. "

The ouster clause in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No.4 of 2002 came up for

interpretation in the case of Ratnayake v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others

(2013) 1 Sri LR 331 where it was held:-

8

l

l. Court of Appeal did possess jurisdiction to hear and determine the application filed

before it.

2. AAT is not a body exercising any power delegated to it by the PSC and is an

appellate tribunal constituted in terms of Article 59(1) having the power, to alter,

vary or rescind any order or decision of the Psc.

Per Saleem Marsoof, J.

"In arriving at the decision this Court has not given its mind fully to the legal effect of Section 8(2) of

the AAT Act 4 of2002 and in particular to the effect of the provisions of section22-Interprtation

Ordinance 21 of1901-as the preliminary objection was confined to Article 61A of the Constitution."

This decision makes it quite clear that a decision of the AA T on a PSC decision can be

impugned under Article 140 of the Constitution. As the AA T is not a body exercising any

power delegated to it by the PSC but is an appellate tribunal constituted in terms of

Article 59(1) of the Constitution having the power where appropriate to alter, vary or

rescind any order or decision of the Psc.

The Administrative Appeal Tribunal (AAT) has decided by its order date 18.12.2012 that it

has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the doctrine ultra vires because such power is vested

solely in the Supreme Court. Hence the learned Chairman and the other members of the

AAT have disregarded the fact that the said advertisement published by the Secretary of

Ministry of Education was ultra vires and void.

Even in an appellate jurisdiction, the Appellate body is empowered to correct errors of law

and fact and the AAT enjoys the competence to vary or rescind a decision of the PSC when

it is tainted with an error of law and fact. If the PSC has given effect to a decision of a

public officer who has clearly exceeded his powers, it is within the jurisdiction of the AA T

to go into the merits of that decision in its appellate jurisdiction and set it right if it turns

out to be erroneous on the facts or law. I find that the AA T has not exercised its

jurisdiction in its full plenitude and rested it decision by merely classifying the decision of

the PSC as ultra vires.

9

In the circumstances, I proceed to set aside the order of the AA T dated 18.12.2012 and

direct the AA T to rehear the appeal of the Petitioner and investigate the merits of the

decision of the Psc. It is not uncommon to issue a Certiorari and compel the Tribunal to

exercise its jurisdiction even though Mandamus has not been prayed for in jurisdictions

where Administrative Law has been on the ascendant and developed to cater to changing

times, Courts have been innovative so as to permit the contours of Administrative Law to

expand and in my view that in a situation such as an abdication of jurisdiction, the Court

should be competent to issue what I would call 'Mandamusified Certiorari'. A Mandamusified

Certiorari is a Writ of Certiorari that also performs the job of a Mandamus whilst quashing

a previous decision of an Administrative Tribunal-see Administrative Law (Eleventh

Edition) by H.W.R Wade and c.F. Forsyth page 518 fn 158.

Certiorarified Mandamus and Mandamusified Certiorari become component parts of the

Administrative Law of this country as Article 140 of the Constitution mandates the

importation of English Administrative Law in its peremptory dictate to this Court-"the

jurisdiction to issue writs shall be according to Law which has been held to constitute the

corpus of English Administrative Law" -see Dr. MD. W Lokuge v. Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri

Fernando and Others (supra).

Accordingly this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari-a Mandamusified Certiorari at that on the

ground of Illegality and Procedural Impropriety. The case is sent back to the AA T for the

AA T to recommence Appellate proceedings after noticing the parties.
