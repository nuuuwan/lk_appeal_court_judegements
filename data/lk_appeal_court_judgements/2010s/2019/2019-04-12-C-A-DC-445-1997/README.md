M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The original Plaintiff-Respondent above-named (Plaintiff) instituted

the above styled action in the District Court of Kurunegala to partition

the land called Watakeiyapotha Kumbura morefully described in the

schedule to the plaint.

In the trial, the Plaintiff had given evidence before the learned District

Judge. Since the Defendants of the action had contested, only on

Plaintiffs evidence case concluded and interlocutory decree and the

final decree were entered on 27.12.1990 and 30.06.1994 respectively

(vide page 122 of the appeal brief).

It is important to note that the Appellants already made an

application dated 04.11.1994 after final decree to intervene and

obtain certain relief in terms of Section 328 of the Civil Procedure

Code. Thereafter, an application had been made by the 1st and 2nd

Respondents-Appellants (Appellants) were affected by the execution

5

thereof, accordingly, the Appellants filed a petition dated 27.09.1996

a requested an order from the District Court directing the Plaintiff to

hand over possession of the land to the Appellants (vide page 345 of

the appeal brief).

After an inquiry, the learned District Judge dismissed the above

application of the Appellants. Being aggrieved by the said decision,

the Appellant preferred this appeal to vary the said decision of the

learned District Judge.

When this matter was called for steps for Substitution, Counsel for

the Person Noticed as 7A Defendant-Respondent brought to the

attention of Court on two Preliminary Objections as to the

maintainability of this appeal.

It was the submission of the 7A Defendant-Respondent that this

appeal is not maintainable on the following grounds:

a. There is no right of appeal as this was not an order having

the effect of a final order but only and interlocutory order.

b. There is in any event no right of appeal as Section 328 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

I would like deal the issue (a) whether the questioned order of the

learned District Judge is a final judgment or an order which comes

under Section 754 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 754 (1) and 754 (2) read as follows:

6

(1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment

pronounced, by any original court in any civil action,

proceeding or matter to which he is a party may prefer an

appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for

any error in fact or in law.

(2) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order

made by any original court in the course of any civil action,

proceeding, or matter to which he is or seeks to be a party,

may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such

order for the correction of any error in fact or in law, with

the leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

In order to decide this question, I would like to consider certain

judicial decisions.

In Shubrook vs. Tufnell [(1882) 9 QBD 621], where Jessel, MR and

Lindley, LJ held that, an order is final if it finally determines the matter

in litigation. Thus the issue of final and interlocutory depended on the

nature and the effect of the order made.

In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathie [(1998) 3 SLR 232], the Supreme Court

held that the interlocutory decree is not final and the order of the

District Court is not a judgment within the meaning of Section 754 (1)

and 754 (5) of Civil Procedure Code for purpose of an appeal.

7

In Salter Rex and Co. vs. Gosh [(1972) 2 All ER 865] Lord Denning, M.

R. stated that:

If their decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands

finally dispose of matter in dispute, I think that for the

purpose of these Rules it is final. On the other hand, if their

decision, if given in one way, will finally dispose of the

matter in dispute, but, if given in the order, will allow the

action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

Counsel for the 7A Defendant-Respondent referring the Senanayake

vs. Jayantha case, strenuously submitted that the in the District

Court, if the application was allowed, the Appellants would intervene

and file objections to their dispossession and the inquiry would

continue (that means that one of the possible orders contained the

possibility of the action continuing), therefore, Counsel for the 7A

Defendant-Respondent has taken up a position that the order

impugned is not an application for final appeal, it should have been a

leave to appeal.

In Senanayake Vs. Jayantha [SC Appeal No. 41/15 and SC CHC 37/08,

SC Minutes dated: 04.08.2017] a bench of seven judges was held that:

In order to decide whether a order is a final judgment or

not. it is my considered view that the proper approach is

the approach adopted by lord Esher in Salaman vs Warner

(supra) which was cited with approval by Lord Denning in

Salter Rex vs Gosh (supra). It stated:

8

If their decision whichever way it is given, will if it

stands finally dispose of the matter in dispute, I

think that for the purpose of these Rules it is final.

On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one

way, will finally dispose of the matter in dispute,

but, if given in the other, will allow the action to go

on, then I think it is not final, but interlocutory.

Therefore orders given in both cases are interlocutory

orders and the proper course of action is to file leave to

appeal application under section 754 (2) and not preferring

and appeals under section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code.

After having heard these submissions and the judicial literature, I am

agreeable with the 7A Defendants-Respondent that the said order of

the learned District Judge is an order which is fell under Section

754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Further, this Court was invited to consider Section 328 of the Civil

Procedure Code.

Counsel for the 7A Defendant-Respondent submitted that, it is quite

clear from the Appellants application dated 04.11.1994 before the

District Court is under Section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Therefore, Counsel for the 7A Defendant-Respondent has taken up a

position that no appeal shall available under this Section.

9

Section 329 reads as follows:

No appeal shall lie from any order made under section 326

or section 327 or section 328 against any party other than

the judgment-debtor. Any such order shall not bar the right

of such party to institute an action to establish his right or

title to such property.

Therefore, in this juncture, I wish to re-call the findings of Anil

Gunaratne, J. on Section 329, in C. A. 1911/1997 (F) [CA Minutes

dated 27.10.2011].

The follow up to Section 241 is found in Sections 242 - 245.

Under section 244 court could release the property claimed

and under Section 245 disallow the claim after

investigation. The question is whether there is a right of

appeal to the dissatisfied party? The Draftsman of these

provisions and the legislature had not included a

provision to enable parties to appeal or to state that there

is no such right of appeal. It is silent. Does it mean that

one could infer or imply a right of appeal to a party

dissatisfied? In comparison I prefer to look at Section 328

of the Civil Procedure Code relating to claims of bone fide

possessors who are dispossessed. Effect of final order

under Section 326, 327 & 328 is subject to same conditions

of appeal. As such denial of a right of appeal is embodied

in the section itself. (Section 329).

10

In the above case, Anil Gunaratne, J. had taken a view that there is no

appeal lie from any order made under Section 244 and 326 of the Civil

Procedure Code (vide page 22-23). Therefore, my conclusion is

fortified as I gather more supports from the above mentioned case

namely, C. A. 1911/1997(F) [CA Minutes dated 27.10.2011].

For the forgoing reasons, I allow the preliminary objections of the

Respondent and dismiss the appeal without cost.
