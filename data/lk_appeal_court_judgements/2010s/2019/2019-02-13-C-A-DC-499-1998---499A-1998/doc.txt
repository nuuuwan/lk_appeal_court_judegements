Appellant.

Arjuna Udawatta for the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Decided on: 12.02.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court seeking to

partition the land known as Delgahawatta. There was a corpus

3

dispute as well as a pedigree dispute. The pedigree dispute was

contested intensely whereby several groups of defendants came

out with different pedigrees. After trial the learned District

Judge in his Judgment accepted the plaintiffs version in relation

to both the disputes. The 14th, 15th and 17th defendants; and

24th defendant have appealed against the Judgment.

Only the 15A defendant-appellant, 24th defendant-appellant and

substituted plaintiff-respondent participated in the argument.

When this matter came before me for the first time, learned

counsel for the said parties invited the Court to dispose of the

argument by way of written submissions.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the 15A

defendant-appellant, Dr. Cooray, that the case must be sent

back to the District Court to enter a legally correct judgment on the

oral and documentary evidence led at the trial in this case as the

Judgment entered by the learned District Judge is ex facie

erroneous. I totally agree. This Court cannot rewrite the

District Court Judgment. I express my gratitude to Dr. Cooray

for not insisting on a retrial. The case had been filed in 1976 in

the District Court and the Judgment has been entered 21 years

later in 1997. Now we are in 2019. Between then and now 43

years have passed by, and it will be a crime to send the case for

retrial as there will not be anyone in the present generation who

can speak about the pedigree.

At the trial the substituted plaintiff, Chalo Singho, who was the

son of the original plaintiff, has given evidence. According to the

pedigree of the plaintiff as set out in the plaint, Sinnappu was

the original owner of the land. His rights have devolved on only

son Abeynis, who had five children, Haramanis, Davith,

4

Thelenis, Karlinahamy and a person unknown to the plaintiff.

Thelenis and unknown person have died issueless and thereby

Haramanis, Davith and Karlinahamy have each become entitled

to 1/3 of the corpus.

The plaintiff in his evidence is emphatic that he was asking only

Haramanis rights.1 He has in the plaint stated that 1/3 each

share of Davith and Karlinahamy shall be left unalloted as he

was unaware of the devolution of title of both of them.

He has further stated in the plaint that Davith out of his 1/3

share transferred 1/10 to Karamanis by Deed No. 2810 executed

in 1870, which was marked by the plaintiff P9, and Karamanis

married to Daviths only daughter Karlinahamy.

There is a confusion here because the plaintiff in the plaint talks

about two Karlinahamys: one who had 1/3 share, and another

who is the daughter of Davith. However, in evidence, the

plaintiff has stated that he does not know whether Karamanis

got married or not.2 Further he has stated that he is not certain

whether Karlinahamy was Abeynis daughter or Daviths

daughter.3

If I may stop at that, as the learned counsel for the 15A

defendant-appellant submits, the learned District Judge has got

himself confused the whole thing from the very beginning. There

cannot be any dispute that the learned District Judge accepted

the plaintiffs pedigree as opposed to those unfolded by different

other parties.

However, the learned District Judge in the Judgment states that

as the plaintiff has agreed to apportion 1/10 to Davith by

producing Deed No. 2810 as P9, he decides that there were two

original owners to the corpus, i.e. Davith who owned 1/10 share

and Sinno Appu who owned 9/10 share. This is an entirely

incorrect conclusion. The position of the plaintiff was that, if I

may repeat, Davith was a son of Abeynis who was the son of

Sinno Appu, the original owner. The plaintiff produced Deed P9

to say that Davith who had 1/3 share transferred 1/10 out of

1/3 to Karamanis.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff-

respondent, this being a partition action, the learned District

Judge is entitled to come to independent conclusions

irrespective of what parties may or may not say. I agree with

that submission on principle but wish to state that in this

instance the District Judge came to that conclusion not on any

rational basis but on utter confusion on facts. I will further

illustrate it in the next few paragraphs.

The District Judge does not say that he disagrees with the

pedigree of the plaintiff on that point but states he does so

because the plaintiff agreed to give 1/10 from the whole land to

Davith. This is what the District Judge states in that regard.

1/10 ,

9/10 ,

1/10 .4 This is an erroneous finding.

4 Vide 3rd paragraph from top of page 3 of the Judgment at page 601 of the Brief.

By coming to that finding, the District Judge has completely

forgotten the plaintiffs position that there were three original

owners, i.e. Haramanis 1/3, Davith 1/3 and Karalinahamy 1/3;

and the plaintiff is claiming only through Haramanis 1/3.

Having stated in the manner which I quoted in Sinhala above,

immediately thereafter, the District Judge says that Haramanis,

Davith and Karalinahamy gets 1/3 each from the entire corpus!

This is how the District Judge states it.

Thereafter the District Judge says that Daviths 1/10 share out

of his 1/3 share was transferred by Deed P9 to Haramanis (and

not Karamanis as stated in the plaint and the Deed); and

Daviths daughter Karalinahamy became entitled to the balance

share of Davith, i.e. 9/30; and Karlinahamy got married to

Haramanis! This is how the District Judge states it in the

Judgment. 1/10 1870

Thereafter the District Judge has stated how Karalinahamys

rights devolved on her husband and seven children.

Thereafter the District Judge has stated Karalinahamy is

Abeynis daughter and as the devolution of Daviths 1/10 share

and Karalinahamys 9/30 share (on the basis that Karalinahamy

is one of the three owners who owned 1/3 each) are not stated,

those shares shall be left unallotted! 1/10 ,

9/30

, .8

These findings are completely contradictory inter se and per se.

This is not all but I pointed them out to highlight that the

Judgment of the District Judge cannot be allowed to stand even

for a moment.

Soon after the plaintiffs case was closed, the 15th defendant

(now 15A defendant-appellant) has given evidence. The 8A, 14th,

15th, 16th defendants are said to be siblings. They seem to be in

possession of Lot 11 of the Preliminary Plan, which is the largest

Lot in the Plan. The 15th defendant has produced very old

Deeds such as Deed No. 10495 executed in 1913 marked 8V3,

Deed No. 17518 executed in 1902 marked 8V4, Deed No. 10806

executed in 1913 marked 8V5, Deed No. 14325 executed in

1899 marked 8V6, Deed No. 9300 executed in 1912 marked 8V7

and also Deed No. 2810 executed in 1870 marked 8V8.9 The

7 Vide last paragraph of page 5 of the Judgment at page 603 of the Brief. 8 Vide last three lines of paragraph 1 of page 9 of the Judgment at page 607 of the Brief. 9 Vide pages 151-181 of the Brief for these Deeds.

8

District Judge has rejected all these very old Deeds solely on the

basis that there is no proof how the grantors of those Deeds got

title to the corpus.10 However it is interesting to note that when

the abovementioned last Deed No. 2810 (8V8) was produced by

the plaintiff as P9, the District Judge readily accepted it without

a murmur. The District Judges said rejection of those Deeds is

totally unacceptable.

The District Judge has not considered at all the old Deeds

produced by the 24th defendant-appellant marked 20V2-20V8.11

The District Judge has not considered the pedigrees of the other

defendants. He has manifestly misdirected himself on

evaluation of evidence.

I unhesitatingly set aside the Judgment of the learned District

Judge and direct the incumbent District Judge to deliver the

Judgment afresh having regard to the evidence led and

documents produced at the trial.

As the plaintiff is not responsible for this misfortune, let the

parties bear their own costs of appeal.

Appeal allowed.
