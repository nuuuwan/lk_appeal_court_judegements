*****

M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted this action in the District Court of Trincomalee

against the original Defendant and prayed for a declaration that she is

entitled to the land and premises morefully described in the schedule B to

the plaint and for ejectment of the Defendant from the said land and

premises.

The Respondent in her plaint pleaded her title to the land in

suit and stated that the Defendant has unlawfully, illegally, and by force

entered the land in suit in September 1992. Whereas, the Defendant in his

answer denied the averments contained in the plaint and prayed the Court

for declaration of title for the land morefully described in the schedule B to

the answer.

The learned District Judge of Trincomalee fixed the case for

trial on 18 issues initially, and while giving evidence also parties raised

few issues and totally 27 issues were recorded. On 07.01.1998, while the

Defendant was giving evidence, Attorney for the Respondent raised the

issues Nos. 23-27; and Attorney for the Defendant had strongly objected

those issues. However, the said issues Nos. 23-27 were not allowed by the

learned District Judge at the time of the trial (on 07.01.1998) and he

allowed them separately on the same day of the judgment prior to

pronouncing of the judgment.

The said judgment was delivered in favour of the

Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 22.07.1999, this

appeal preferred by the Defendant-Appellant to set aside the judgment of

the District Court and grant the reliefs prayed for in the answer or make an

order for re-trial.

When this matter came up for argument on 02.08.2017,

Counsel for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the Appellant) raised a Preliminary Objection and stated that the case

should be sent back for re-trial, without going into merit of the case, as the

learned District Judge allowed the issues Nos. 23-27 on 22.07.1999 and

answered the said issues in the judgment delivered on the same day.

Thereupon, this Court overruled the said Preliminary Objection and fixed

the matter for argument and directed the parties to file their respective

written submissions as per their request made on 20.06.2018.

The Respondents case in the District was that she is the

owner of the land morefully described in the schedule B to the plaint

which is part of the land described in the schedule A to the plaint by way

of paper title and prescription. Her position with regard to the title was

that she became entitled to the said land which is described in the schedule

B to the plaint by Deed of Gift No. 10 dated 28.08.1989 attested by

Ramalingam Notary Public.

The Respondent and four other witnesses gave evidence

on behalf of the Respondent and appended documents marked P1-P21.

Having heard both parties, I observed that the case in

hand is a rei vindicatio action. Therefore, to proceed further, I like to invite

the following words of Gooneratne, J. in Wadduwage Dharmadasa vs.

Manthree Vithanage Jinasena ((2012) B.L.R Vol. XIX, Part II, p 336):

"in a rei vindicatio action the Plaintiff must prove and establish his

title. If the Plaintiff has so established his title the burden of proof is

shifted to the defendant to establish his lawful occupation if any.

When the plaintiffs' title is accepted by Court, the burden is on the

defendant to establish his prescriptive possession."

Having concentrated the above accustomed approach, a

careful perusal of the documents appended by the Respondent show that

the original owner of the entire land (schedule A to the plaint) in suit was

one Mrs. Maragathammal Mageshan and after 1973, she transferred the

property to Pushpadevi Thambaiah by the Deed No. 1568 dated 21.11.1973

attested by R. Sampanthan Notary Public is depicted in Plan No. 322 dated

5

23.11.1973 made by Veluppillai Licensed Surveyor, then after 1989, the

said Pushpadevi Thambaiah transferred a portion (in extent of 10.31

Perches) of the land (morefully described in the schedule B to the plaint)

by way of Deed of Gift No. 10 dated 28.08.1989 attested by Ramalingam

Notary Public to the Respondent.

I fully subscribe to the view of the learned District Judge

that the Respondent established her chain of title and deeds which were

appended to the plaint and marked without objections at the trial.

The learned District Judge was mindful of the fact that

the Appellant while cross-examining admitted that the Respondent

obtained the land in suit from said Pushpadevi Thambaiah who is a

predecessor in the title:

(Page 231 of the appeal brief)

Therefore, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that, in

the above circumstances, without doubt, it is an admitted fact by the

Appellant that the Respondent is the owner of the land referred to in

schedule B of the plaint.

In my view, this circumstance is corresponding with Section 58 of the

Evidence Ordinance, which states:

"No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto

or their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the

hearing, they agree to admit any writing under their hands, or

7

which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to

have admitted by their pleadings:

Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts

admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission."

Thus, in my view, according to the above provision, the

admission of a fact may perhaps take place at three stages-to wit- (1) at the

hearing or trial, (2) before the hearing or trial, or (3) by rule of pleading.

Therefore, the said admission of this case which I have alluded above is at

the stage of hearing of trial.

In the case of K. G. Jayanath Kulasiriwardena vs. J. A.

Ranjanie Jayasinghe and 3 others [SC/Appeal/146/12, (Supreme Court

Minutes dated: 17.02.2016)] Aluwihare P. C., J. observed that:

Admissions recorded by the parties in any proceeding, are not the

same as Admissions contemplated in section 17 of the Evidence

Ordinance, but are "admitted facts" within the meaning of Section

58 of the Evidence Ordinance. Section 17 of the Evidence ordinance

defines Admissions and Confessions and is a provision governing

relevancy. Section 17 (1) read with Section 21 of the Evidence

Ordinance merely permits a "statement to be admitted as evidence

if that "statement" falls within the definition of an Admission in

terms of section 17 of the Evidence Ordinance. That is to say the

trial judge is required to evaluate the item of evidence so adduced

under section 21 and consider the probative value that should be

attached to it. It is entirely at the discretion of the judge to decide

8

whether or not to act upon the Admission as an item of evidence,

having given due consideration to the statement.

On the other hand, admissions recorded by contesting parties to any

proceeding fall within the ambit of Section 58 of the Evidence

Ordinance, a provision governing proof and has no bearing on the

issue of relevancy.

Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance says, no fact need be proved

in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree to

admit at the hearing... Thus, there is no duty cast on the court

to consider either the credibility or the probative value of

such facts but is required to treat such facts as "proved facts".

Further, on the question of admission during a trial, it is

relevant to reiterate the observation of A. H. M. D. Nawaz, J., in Abdul

Wakeel and 3 others vs. Hewage Sirisena and 6 others [CA Case No.

1218/1996 (F), (Court of Appeal Minutes dated: 27.09.2016)]:

Let me digress at this stage on the question of admissions. We come

across "admissions" for the first time only in Section 17 of the

Evidence Ordinance because the first exception to the hearsay rule in

the Evidence Ordinance begins from Section 17. Section 17(1) of the

Evidence Ordnance defines an admission as a statement, oral or

documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or

relevant fact. Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance deals with

informal admissions, whereas Section 58 deals with formal

admissions. Whichever category that an admission belongs to, it has

9

to be remembered that Section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance renders

an admission admissible against the maker of the admission....

(Page at 10)

So, it is quite clear that the Appellant admitted certain

important facts regarding the predecessor in title and the attendant facts of

land in suit which belongs to the Respondent.

During the trial, the Respondent had called several

witnesses to establish that she and her predecessor in title have been in

possession of the land in suit till September 1992 - until the Respondent

entered into the land. Pushpadevi Thambaiah, Thambaiah

Kumarasundaram (father-in-law of the Respondent) and Kandavanam

Sinnathamby an officer of the Urban Council of Trincomalee are credible

witnesses on behalf of the Respondent (vide pages 275-279 in appeal brief).

However, in the appeal, the Appellant submitted that his

predecessors in title became the owners of the subject land under and by

virtue of the decree entered in the District Court of Trincomalee Case

bearing No. 111 dated 13.11.1903 and accordingly one Mailvaganam

Mudaliyar Subramaniyam became the owner of the subject land. He

further submitted that thereafter the said Mailvaganam Mudaliyar

Subramaiyam gifted the subject land to Mrs. Alagasundaram wife of

Mailvaganam Mudaliyar Subramaniyam under and by virtue of Deed No.

12017 dated 03.03.1930 attested by Nadesapillai Notary Public. Thereafter,

in 1972, the said Mrs. Alagasundaram donated the said land to

Alagumalarsodhi wife of the Appellant by Deed No. 1423 dated 23.08.1972

10

attested by R. Sambandham Notary Public. And thereafter, the said

Alagumalarsodhi died and her estate was administrated in District Court

of Jaffna Case No. T/4356. The heirs of the said Alagumalarsodhi were her

husband the Appellant and 3 minor children.

He further submitted that, it was in those circumstances,

the Deed of Partition bearing No. 5105 (D13) dated 15.11.1992 attested by

S. A. Hameed Notary Public was executed among the Appellant and other

3 heirs of the said Alagumalarsodhi and accordingly the Appellant became

the owner of the property morefully described in the schedule B to the

answer.

At this juncture, it is important to note that issue Nos. 23-

27 have been raised on 02.01.1998 by the Respondent on the basis that

there were no details given in the Deed of Partition D13 with regard to the

Power of Attorney in the attestation the said deed states that S.

Thirunavukarasu, T. Ramesh Shankar by his Attorney S. Thirunavukarasu and

T. Vathsala signed the said Deed of Partition. In this regard, the Appellant

submitted that the said Deed bearing No. 5105 D13 was produced in Court

06.01.1998 and it was not objected by the Respondent.

However, I am of the view that the above contention of

the Appellant cannot be sustained. The said D13 had produced on

06.01.1998 and the Respondent was given an opportunity to raise

questions on the said D13 only 07.01.1998 during the cross-examination; at

that time only the Respondent raised the issue No. 23-27. Accordingly, the

11

learned District Judge also had answered the issues 23-27 in favour of the

Respondent. I see no errors in this regard from the learned District Judge.

Further, it is settled law that according to Section 146 and

149 of the Civil Procedure Code a trial Court may at any time before

passing a decree, amended any issue or frame additional issues on such

terms as it thinks fit (vide Hameed vs. Cassim 1996 2 SLR 30; Arudaiappan

vs. Indian Overseas Bank 1995 2 SLR 131). These same questions

(preliminary objection raised by the Appellant) were already answered

and settled by the judgment dated 05.12.2017.

Furthermore, I am of the view that the learned trial Judge

has considered the entire evidence led at trial and dismissed Appellants

case. This Court being an Apex Court does not wish to interfere with

several factual positions dealt with by the Original Court. Unless perverse

orders are made by the lower Courts it would not be in order for a

Superior Court to interfere with factual matters.

Having found that the Respondent has established her

title to the land in dispute, I can reach a conclusion that the Appellant has

not established his lawful possession or other title.

The answers given by the learned District Judge of

Trincomalee to issues No. 23-27 are correct.

In the circumstances, the learned District Judges

judgment dated 22.07.1999 should be affirmed.

12

Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the appeal without costs.

Appeal dismissed.
