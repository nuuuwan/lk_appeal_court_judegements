Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. The 26th Defendant-Appellant filed a

statement of claim. At the date of the trial, she was absent, and

the registered Attorney informed the District Court that he had

no instructions. The trial has proceeded, and the Judgment has

been delivered on 17.09.1996, and the Interlocutory Decree has

been entered. The Court Commissioner has prepared the final

scheme of partition and has sent the proposed Final Plan and

the Report to Court, and the Court has fixed a date for

consideration of the proposed scheme of partition.

Thereafter the 26th Defendant by Petition dated 26.11.1997 has

made an application under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition

Law seeking to set aside the Judgment and the Interlocutory

Decree on the basis that she was unable to come to Court on the

trial date due to illness.

3

Having held an inquiry into this application, the learned District

Judge has dismissed the application of the 26th Defendant by

order dated 12.01.1999 on the premise that her evidence on

inability to participate in the trial was unsatisfactory. Being

aggrieved by that Order, the 26th Defendant has filed this

appeal.

It is my considered view that, this appeal shall be dismissed on

three distinct grounds.

(a) The application of the 26th Defendant under section

48(4)(a) of the Partition Law is misconceived in law.

(b) Even if the 26th Defendant could file the application

under that section, the application to the District Court

has been filed out of time.

(c) Even if the application has been filed under relevant

section within time, no final appeal lies against that

order.

Let me now consider them in sequence.

On the date of the trial, the 26th Defendant had been absent.

But her registered Attorney with another Attorney-at-Law

(probably, the counsel) having marked their appearance for the

26th Defendant, stated to Court that they have no instructions.

The learned District Judge has not recorded that the trial would

be taken up ex parte against the 26th Defendant, but has

proceeded to trial and delivered the Judgment.

This is different from the registered Attorney being totally absent

on the trial date or having been present in Court stating to the

Judge that he does not appear for the Defendants, in which

event, trial becomes ex parte. But in this instance, the

registered Attorney has appeared for the 26th Defendant with a

Counsel and stated that he has no instructions thereby the trial

has become inter partes.

In the Supreme Court case of Jinadasa v. Sam Silva2,

Amarasinghe J. held:

When a registered attorney whose proxy is on record is

present in court, but has no instructions, he nevertheless

appears and there is no default in appearance. However

there may be circumstances in which the presence of a

registered attorney may not be an appearance.

Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Andiappa Chettiar v.

Sanmugan Chettiar3 (comprising of Macdonell C.J., Garvin

S.P.J., Lyall Grant J., Maartensz A.J.) held that:

The presence in Court, when a case is called, of the proctor

on the record constitutes an appearance for the party from

whom the proctor holds the proxy, unless the proctor

expressly informs the Court that he does not, on that

occasion, appear for the party.

2 [1994] 1 Sri LR 232 3 (1932) 33 NLR 217

Stating no instructions is not sufficient. He must expressly

state does not appear. Whether the registered Attorney on

record, until the proxy is revoked, can say he does not appear

due to some reason (such as his professional fees for that day

have not been paid) is another question.4

Garvin J. at page 222 stated:

If the proctor, though present, does not wish his presence to

be construed as an appearance on behalf of his client, he

must immediately inform the Court that he does not desire

to and is not entering or making an appearance in the case.

This must be done clearly and unambiguously. It is not

sufficient, as in the case under consideration, to say that he

has no instructions. A proctor who has no instructions may

nevertheless do much for his client and in his interests. The

Court, as I have said, is entitled to know at the outset

whether the proctor is making an appearance for his client

or not and unless he states that he is not making such an

appearance, it is entitled to treat his presence as an

appearance and to proceed as if the party had appeared.

In Malwatta v. Gunasekera5, Palakidnar J. referred to this

Judgment to state that if the proctor, does not wish his presence

to be construed as an appearance he must clearly and

unambiguously state so. It is not sufficient to say that he has no

instructions.

The Supreme Court in Cisilin Nona alias Pesonahamy v.

Gunasena Jayawardena6 also referred to the Full Bench

decision in Andiappa Chettiars case and held that when the

Attorney on record says no instructions, still the trial is

conducted inter partes and not ex parte. Chitrasiri J. opined:

Having referred to the law applicable in this connection, I

will now advert to the facts of this case in order to

determine whether the trial in the original court was inter-

partes or was it a trial ex-parte. Both in the journal entry

and in the proceedings recorded on 27.05.1997 show that

Mr. Junaideen Attorney-at-law, on that date, he being the

proxy holder had marked his appearance on behalf of the

respondent. Even the answer of the respondent had been

filed under his name.

Having marked his appearance for the respondent, he has

merely submitted that the respondent had not given him

instructions to appear on that particular date. Authorities

referred to above show that the trial judge, under those

circumstances should have taken up the matter considering

it as an inter-partes trial and allowed the counsel to cross

examine the witness. Accordingly, it is clear that the Court

of Appeal has correctly decided the issue in this case

having adopted the law relevant thereto. In the

circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere with the

decision of the Court of Appeal.

Ironically, the learned Counsel for the 26th Defendant cites the

last mentioned Supreme Court Judgment to say that the case

has been heard inter partes and not ex parte and the Appellant is

entitled to make the application under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the

Partition Law. That argument is clearly misplaced in law. If the

learned Counsel accepts that the trial has been conducted

against the 26th Defendant inter partes, then the 26th Defendant

has no right to make an application under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of

the Partition Law.

This leads me to shift to the next point. That is, even if the trial

has been conducted ex parte against the 26th defendant, and

therefore the 26th Defendant could have made the application

under section 48(4)(a)(iv), the application has not been filed

within the stipulated time, and therefore, it ought to have been

rejected by the learned District Judge in limine. In fact, the

learned Counsel who appeared for the Plaintiff in the District

Court has, in his objections7 and the written submissions8 has

stated it, but the learned District Judge has just ignored it,

which should not have been done.

Section 48(4)(a) reads as follows:

Whenever a party to a partition action-

(i) has not been served with summons or

(ii) being a minor or a person of unsound mind, has not

been duly represented by a guardian ad litem, or

7 Vide pages 224-225 of the Brief. 8 Vide pages 133-135 of the Brief.

8

(iv) being a party who has duly filed his statement of

claim and registered his address, fails to appear at

the trial,

and in consequence thereof the right, title or interest of such

party to or in the land which forms the subject-matter of the

interlocutory decree entered in such action has been

extinguished or such party has been otherwise prejudiced

by the interlocutory decree, such party or where such party

is a minor or a person of unsound mind, a person appointed

as guardian ad litem of such party may, on or before the

date fixed for the consideration of the scheme of partition

under section 35 or at any time not later than thirty days

after the return of the person responsible for the sale under

section 42 is received by court, apply to the court for special

leave to establish the right, title or interest of such party to

or in the said land notwithstanding the interlocutory decree

already entered. [emphasis is added]

A party who can come under section 48(4)(a) to have the

Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree set aside, cannot go

before the District Judge at any time he feels free. According to

that section, he can do so:

(a) on or before the date fixed for the consideration of the

scheme of partition under section 35, or

(b) at any time not later than thirty days after the return of

the person responsible for the sale under section 42 is

received by court

9

In terms of section 26(2) of the Partition Law, the District Judge

trying a partition case, can, in the Interlocutory Decree, make

several orders, which include, an order for partition of the land

and an order for a sale of the land. Section 35 relates to the

former, and section 42 relates to the latter.

In the instant case, the applicable section is section 35 as the

learned District Judge after the trial ordered to partition the

land.

Section 35 of the Partition Law reads as follows:

After the surveyor makes a return to the commission, the

court shall call the case in open court and shall fix a date

for the consideration of the scheme of partition proposed by

the surveyor. The date so fixed shall be a date not earlier

than thirty days after the receipt of such return by the

court.

In the instant case, the surveyor, having executed the

commission for Final Partition Plan, returned same to Court on

20.10.19979. Thereafter, the Court called the case on

22.10.199710, and fixed the date for consideration of the

proposed scheme of partition on 25.11.1997, which is not earlier

than thirty days after the receipt of the proposed Final Plan by

Court in terms of section 35 of the Partition Law.

9 Vide Court Date Stamp (20.10.1997) on the Plan at page 147 of the Brief. 10 Vide JE No.47. As per JE No.45 dated 03.09.1997, 22.10.1997 was the next calling date.

10

However, the 26th Defendant made the application under section

48(4)(a)(iv), on 26.11.199711, which is, after the date fixed for the

consideration of the scheme of partition under section 35. This

time limit in a partition case is mandatory. Hence the District

Judge ought to have dismissed the application of the 26th

Defendant in limine without wasting time in recording evidence

to refuse that application.

Although it did not arise in this case, for completeness, I must

state that, to make the application under section 48(4), a party

need not wait until the return of the commission by the

surveyor, whether under section 35 or 42. The application can

be made at any time, subject however to the qualification that, if

the order is to partition the land, before the date fixed for the

consideration of the scheme of partition, and if the order is to

sell the land, not later than thirty days after the return of the

commission for sale.

In view of the Judgment of G.P.S. de Silva C.J. in Podinona v.

Premadasa12, there is a misconception that, the application

shall be made within thirty days of the return of the commission

for proposed Final Partition Plan. That is not correct. At the

time of the said Judgment was delivered, although the

application could have been made at any time, not later than

thirty days after the date on which the return of the surveyor

under section 32 or the return of the person responsible for the

sale under section 42, as the case may be, is received by the

court, the Law was changed by Partition (Amendment) Act No.17

11 Vide pages 186-191 of the Brief. 12 [1996] 2 Sri LR 191

11

of 1997 whereby a distinction was made between the return of

two commissions (partition and sale) under section 32 and 42,

and made it imperative to make the application on or before the

date fixed for the consideration of the scheme of partition under

section 35 or at any time not later than thirty days after the return

of the person responsible for the sale under section 42 is received

by court.

I will now deal with the last point, which is, the final appeal filed

against the impugned order is misconceived in law, and

therefore this appeal shall be rejected.

The learned counsel for the 26th Defendant states that this

appeal was filed under section 67 of the Partition Law, which

allows, subject to section 36A and 45A, a party dissatisfied with

any Judgment, Decree or Order made or entered by the District

Court in a partition action to come before this Court by way of

final appeal. Conversely, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-

Respondent submits that the 26th Defendant should have come

by way of leave to appeal under section 754(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code and not by way of final appeal under section

754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 67(1) of the Partition Law reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of sections 36A and 45A, an

appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal against any

judgment, decree or order made or entered by any court in

any partition action; and all the provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code shall, subject to the succeeding provisions

of this section, apply accordingly to any such appeal as

12

though a judgment, decree or order made or entered in a

partition action were a judgment, decree or order made or

entered in any action as defined for the purposes of that

Code.

By reading this section, it is clear that, the law relating to

appeals against Judgments and Orders made by the District

Court in a partition action is governed by the Civil Procedure

Code subject to the provisions of the Partition Law, in particular,

sections 36A and 45A thereof.

The question whether an appeal or leave to appeal lies against

an order of the District Court had been a subject of much

controversy for a long period of time.

One school of thought represented by the leading local case of

Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd13 Justice Sharvananda (later Chief

Justice) opted to adopt order approach (suggested by Lord

Alverstone C.J., in Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council14)

to determine that question. The order approach contemplates

only the nature of the order in isolation. When taken in

isolation, if the order finally disposes of the matter in dispute

without leaving the suit alive, the order is final, and a direct

appeal is the proper remedy against such order.

In De Costa v. De Costa15, this Court, following the Judgment of

Sharvananda J. in Siriwardene v. Air Ceylon (supra) took the

view that, a party aggrieved by an order made upon an

13 [1984] 1 Sri LR 286 14 [1903] 1 KB 547 15 [1998] 1 Sri LR 107

13

application filed under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law

can come by way of final appeal.

The other school of thought represented by the leading local

case of Ranjit v. Kusumawathie16, Justice Dheeraratne opted to

adopt application approach (suggested by Lord Esher M.R., in

Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange17 and Salaman v. Warner18,

and adopted by Lord Denning M.R., in Salter Rex & Co. v.

Ghosh19) to determine that question. The application approach

contemplates only the nature of the application made to Court in

isolation, and not the order delivered per se. In accordance with

this approach, if the order, given in one way, will finally dispose

of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other way, will allow

the action to go on, the order is not final, but interlocutory, in

which event, leave to appeal is the proper remedy.

In fact, in Ranjit v. Kusumawathie (supra) the issue was identical

to the one in the instant case where the appellant came before

the Court of Appeal by way of final appeal against an order made

on an application filed under section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition

Law. The Supreme Court affirmed the Judgment of the Court of

Appeal that the proper remedy was to come by way of leave to

appeal and not final appeal.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Chettiar v. Chettiar20

was called upon to decide on this vexed question, and the Full

Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of five Justices) having

16 [1998] 3 Sri LR 232 17 (1877) 3 CPD 67 18 [1891] 1 QB 734 19 [1971] 2 QB 597 20 [2011] 2 Sri LR 70 and [2011] BLR 25

14

discussed both the approaches stemming from English decisions

unanimously decided that the application approach (and not the

order approach) shall be the criterion in deciding the question

whether appeal or leave to appeal is the proper remedy against

an order of the District Court.

This Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court has consistently

been followed in later Supreme Court cases.21

Notwithstanding this was a Full Bench decision of the Supreme

Court, still, there were some lingering doubts regarding the

correctness of this decision. Therefore, in Senanayake v.

Jayantha22, a Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of

seven Justices) revisited the Chettiars Judgment.

Having so revisited, the Fuller Bench of the Supreme Court

(consisting of seven Justices) has decided that the Judgment of

the Full Bench of the Supreme Court (consisting of five Justices)

in Chettiars case is correct, and the test which shall be applied

in deciding whether appeal or leave to appeal is the proper

remedy against an order of the District Court is the application

approach and not the order approach.

Chief Justice Dep (with the concurrence of the other six Justices

of the Supreme Court) held that:

21 Eg. Yogendra v. Tharmaratnam (SC Appeal No.87/09, SC (HCCA) LA No.84/09) decided on 06.07.2011, Ranasinghe v. Madilin Nona (SC Appeal No.03/09, SC (HC) LA No.147/08) decided on 16.03.2012, Prof. I.K. Perera v. Prof. Dayananda Somasundara (SC Appeal No. 152/2010) decided on 17.03.2011. 22 (SC Appeal No. 41/2015) decided on 04.08.2017

15

In order to decide whether an order is a final judgment or

not, it is my considered view that the proper approach is the

approach adopted by Lord Esher in Salamam v. Warner

[1891] 1 QB 734, which was cited with approval by Lord

Denning in Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [1971] 2 QB 597. It

stated: If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it

stands, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that

for that purpose of these Rules it is final. On the other

hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally

dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other,

will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

When I adopt the Application Test to the present appeal, it is

abundantly clear that, an appeal does not lie against the order of

dismissal made by the District Judge. Notwithstanding the

impugned order takes the shape of a final Judgment as it is, if

the application of the 26th Defendant were to be decided in

favour of her, the case would not have ended there, but the trial

would have proceeded with, and a fresh Judgment would have

been delivered.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the 26th

Defendant but without costs.
