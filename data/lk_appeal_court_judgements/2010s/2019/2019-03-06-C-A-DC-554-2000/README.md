Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action having an extended pedigree. In the

plaint 32 parties were made defendants and at last it shot up to

57.

After the exclusion of, at the beginning of the trial, Lots 6, 7 and

9 of the Preliminary Plan in favour of the Railway Department,

and 38th, 39th, 44th and 45th defendants, there was no corpus

dispute.

But there was a pedigree dispute. Several defendants, as

individuals and groups, have filed several statements of claim.

However, all the defendants, except the contesting 32nd, 34th,

35th, and 46th-50th defendants, have accepted the pedigree of the

plaintiff. The said contesting defendants have come out with a

different pedigree.

At the trial, the plaintiff on one hand, and the said contesting

defendants on the other, raised issues.

3

On behalf of the plaintiff, the plaintiff himself has given

extensive evidence, and tendered documents marked P1-P20.

On behalf of the contesting defendants, 47A defendant has given

evidence and tendered documents marked 32V1-32V10.

In the written submissions filed after the trial before the District

Court, the learned counsel for the contesting defendants has

candidly admitted that the pedigree of the contesting defendants

was not proved.1 Therefore the learned District Judge has not

considered the contesting defendants case in the Judgment.

Then the remaining question was to consider whether the

plaintiffs pedigree could be accepted. The learned District

Judge has not accepted the plaintiffs pedigree either, and

dismissed the plaintiffs action. It is against this Judgment the

plaintiff-appellant has filed this appeal.

As I have already mentioned, the pedigree unfolded by the

plaintiff is a very lengthy and extended one. The evidence of the

plaintiff runs into more than hundred pages.2 He is a man born

in 1929.3 He gave evidence from his own knowledge. It is not

humanly possible to unfold a pedigree of this kind by memory

without making mistakes and sometimes contradictions.

During the re-examination, the plaintiff has produced a copy of

the plaint in another partition case No. 22387 filed in 1941 as

P17, and a copy of the Final Decree as P18. The plaintiff was

not a party to that partition action.4 It is not quite clear why he

produced P17 and P18. At the beginning he has stated that the

pedigree set forth in that plaint P17 is correct5, but later has

stated that he does not accept that pedigree6, and then at last

has stated that he accepts some parts of that pedigree but

rejects the other parts.7

According to the plaintiff, Annochchi Silva was entitled to 5/6

share of the land and it devolved on the parties as described in

his evidence, and the balance 1/6 share shall devolve on the

contesting defendants.

In the former partition case No. 22387 filed in respect of a

different land, same Annochchi Silva has been mentioned as the

original owner.

The learned District Judge has dismissed the plaintiffs action

because the plaintiffs pedigree in the instant action is not

identical to that stated in the plaint in the former partition case

marked P17. Is that correct and permissible?

The main discrepancy between the two pedigrees as found by

the learned District Judge is that, in the plaint of the former

partition case, it has been stated that Annochchi Silva had 6

children including a child by the name of Maria, but in the

pedigree of the instant case, it has been stated that Annochchi

Silva had 5 children without mentioning the name of Maria. No

devolution of Marias rights has been shown by the plaintiff in

the plaint. This is the main reason for the learned District

Judge for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

With the greatest of respect to the learned District Judge, I am

unable to accept that reasoning for the dismissal of a partition

action. As the learned counsel for the 22nd and 27th respondents

has correctly pointed out in his written submissions, whether

Annochchi Silva had five children or six children is not a

contradiction which justifies dismissal of the partition action. If

the learned District Judge came to the conclusion that

Annochchi Silva had six children (including Maria) and not five

children as stated by the plaintiff, the learned Judge could have

left those shares which should have gone to Maria unallotted.

This is applicable not only to Marias rights, but to any others

rights, the devolution of which, has not been satisfactorily

explained. In a partition action of this nature it is not possible

for the plaintiff to present one hundred percent complete

pedigree.

The learned District Judge has found the pedigree of the plaintiff

to be incorrect or incomplete in the light of the contents of the

plaint in a former partition case marked P17. It is significant to

note that P17 was produced not by the contesting defendants to

contradict the plaintiffs pedigree, but by the plaintiff himself. If

the plaintiff had any mala fide intention or conceal something to

deprive somebodys due rights, he could have withheld it. In

fact, P17 has been produced by the plaintiff in re-examination,

and the learned counsel for the contesting defendants has

objected it being produced in evidence but the learned District

Judge has allowed it.8 That means, the contesting defendants

do not admit the pedigree described in P17. Nor do they accept

the pedigree stated by the plaintiff in the plaint in the instant

6

action. Their pedigree is totally different, which they themselves

through their counsel later admitted not to have been proved.

Another important matter is, as I have already stated, the

plaintiff was not a party to the former case, and he does not

accept that pedigree as hundred percent correct either. He

admits certain portions and rejects certain portions. The

learned District Judge has gone on the basis that the pedigree

stated in P17 is the correct pedigree as to devolution of title of

Annochchi Silvas rights. With the greatest of respect, that is

not correct. There is no proof that the Court accepted that

pedigree in its entirety. Although the plaint has been produced,

the Judgment has not been produced to know up to which

extent that pedigree was accepted by the Court. The plaintiff is

neither a party to that case nor claiming title through any of the

parties in that case. That case is regarding a different land. But

that Judgment, if produced, would have had a great persuasive

value to decide the devolution of title of Annochchi Silva.

According to the Final Decree marked P18, it appears to me that

the Court has not accepted the pedigree in P17 in its entirety.

This is made clear by making a comparison the share allocation

suggested by the plaintiff in paragraph 39 of the plaint9 with the

Final Decree marked P18. In the plaint shares have been given

to the plaintiff and 1st-14th defendants whereas in the Final

Decree shares have been given to the plaintiff and 1st-5th, 9th-

14th and 23rd defendants.10 That means, P17 pedigree has not

been accepted as it is.

As I stated earlier, the main concern of the learned District

Judge was the failure of the plaintiff in the instant action not to

disclose the name of Maria as a child of Annochchi Silva and the

devolution of title to that share. The devolution of title of Marias

share has been described in paragraphs 23-29 of the plaint

P17.11 According to those paragraphs, Marias rights ultimately

has gone to W. Appusingho, who appears to be the 15th

defendant in that case.12 Upon his death, it appears that 16th

defendant has been substituted.13 However, it is interesting to

note that, both in paragraph 39 of the plaint P17 and the Final

Decree P18, 15th or 16th defendant has not been given any

rightswhether Marias or otherwise. That means Marias

alleged share has not been considered by some reason. If that is

correct, the plaintiff in the instant action cannot be found fault

with for non-disclosure of Marias alleged share.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the Judgment of the

learned District Judge dated 29.08.2000.

The plaintiff has instituted this action in the District Court 28

years ago in 1991. It is not practically possible to order a retrial

as the plaintiff if still alive will not be able to give evidence due to

his old age. Same shall be true about the 47A defendant who

gave evidence for the contesting defendants. The present

generation has no knowledge of these old pedigrees.

In a partition case, in terms of section 25(1) of the Partition Law,

it is the paramount duty of the District Judge to investigate title

of each party14 quite independently of what parties may or may

not do.15

This Court cannot rewrite the whole Judgment of the District

Court. Taking everything into account, I direct the incumbent

District Judge to deliver the Judgment afresh on the evidence

already led at the trial. In that process, the learned Judge shall

not consider what I have stated on P17 and P18 as concluded

views of this Court. They were referred to in order to justify

setting aside the Judgment of the District Court. The

incumbent Judge is free to take his own views in respect of P17

and P18.

Appeal allowed. Let the parties bear their own costs of appeal.
