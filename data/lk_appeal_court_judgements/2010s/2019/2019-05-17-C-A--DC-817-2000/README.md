01. Plaintiff Appellants (Appellants) instituted the above numbered action in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya by their plaint dated 11.03.1985 praying for a

declaration of title to the land described in schedule 'b' of the plaint and to

eject the defendant from the said land.

02. Defendant Respondent (Respondent) filed answer admitting the 3rd averment

of the plaint which says that Juwanis Appuhamy by deed No. 415 dated

22.03.1948 sold a divided share of 02 roods, 15 and 112 perches to one

Jinadasa. The said Juwanis Appuhamy has by deed No. 34154 dated

2

09.11.1949 had transferred another portion of the land of one rood to the

said Jinadasa. The Respondent further stated that by deed No. 5747 dated

05.09.1961, said Jinadasa had transferred the above lands to him and that he

had been possessing the said lands as one land and that he had not

encroached into appellants land. He prayed that the plaint be dismissed.

03. After trial the learned District judge dismissed the plaint. Among other

reasons, the learned District Judge said in her Judgment that the appellant

had asked for declaration of title for undivided land and that he had changed

his stance at the trial.

04. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the District Judge, the instant

appeal was lodged by the appellant.

05. We have considered the pleadings in the District Court, evidence adduced at

the trial and submissions made by counsel for Appellants and the

Respondents at the argument of the appeal.

06. At the argument of the instant appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted

that the land in suit has to be defined for an action for declaration of title to

succeed. Counsel further conceded that on the evidence adduced at the trial,

the land in question was an undivided land and that it was a portion of a

larger land. Therefore, he conceded that there is no merit in this appeal.

Counsel for the appellant further contended that a partition action has been

already filed to divide the land among the co-owners.

07. As submitted by the counsel for the respondent, during the trial the appellant

had admitted the averments no. 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the answer of the

Respondent. (Vide proceedings dated 10.06.1998) Therefore, the Appellant

had taken a position different to what he took in his plaint.

3

08. It is settled law that a declaration of title cannot be sought on an undivided

land. The property has to be clearly identified. (HarietteV. Pathmasiri [1996

1 Sri L.R. 358], Jamaldeen V. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri L. R. 333).

09. The evidence led at the trial including the admissions recorded shows that

the land in question is an undivided portion of a larger land, which fact the

counsel for the appellant conceded. Counsel also submitted that already a

partition action to divide the land has been filed. We find that the learned

trial Judge righty concluded that the land in question includes an undivided

share of a larger land and that the plaint should be dismissed.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
