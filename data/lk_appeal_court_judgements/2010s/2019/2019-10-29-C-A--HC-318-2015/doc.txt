01. Accused Appellant (Appellant) in the above numbered case was indicted

in the High Court of Colombo for committing an offence punishable under

section 462 to be read with section 455 of the Penal Code. According to the

particulars of the alleged offence as mentioned in the charge is that the

Appellant had in his possession a police clearance certificate knowingly

that it was a forged document.

02. After trial the learned High Court Judge found the Appellant guilty as

charged and sentenced the Appellant to 7 years imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant preferred the

2

instant appeal. The grounds of appeal urged by counsel for the Appellant in

his written submissions are;

1. Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the infirmities in the

prosecution case.

2. Learned High Court Judge failed to address his mind whether the

prosecution has proved the 'Mens Rea ' of the offence beyond

reasonable doubt.

Both grounds of appeal 1 and 2 will be considered together.

03. Facts revealed that there had been two ways to request for police clearance

reports for the migrants. Normal procedure would take about a month to

issue a clearance report. Special procedure had been on a personal

recommendation of an officer whose rank is Senior Superintendent of

Police or above, where the clearance certificate can be obtained without

delay. In this instance, Police Constable 77256 Gayan (PW6) had received

this personal recommendation of SSP Upul Kumarasiri from the Appellant.

Appellant had been a Police Constable attached to the office of the Senior

DIG at Police Headquarters that had been in the same building in a

different floor. On being suspicious of the genuineness of the document

and after ascertaining that the recommendation was not signed by the SSP

Upul Kumarasiri, investigations had commenced.

04. As per the evidence led by the prosecution and as admitted by the Appellant

in his own evidence at the trial, the forged document in question had been

handed over to Police Constable 72256 Gayan by the Appellant. The

Appellant giving sworn evidence in his defence, admitted the fact that the

document in question was handed over to Constable Gayan by him. The

3

evidence ofthe Appellant at the trial was that on the day in question he had

been going to the police clearance office to check on a clearance

application on the request of an ASP named Dharmaratne. Mean time

Officer named Kannangara had given him an envelope containing a

document to be handed over to the clearance department. He had handed

over the same to PC Gayan (PW 6).

05. On being questioned as to how he received the document, he had promptly

said that it was given to him by Officer Kannangara. Evidence also

revealed that on the arrest of Kannangara, investigators had recovered

various productions including rubber stamps of various Police Officers

which can be used to make forged documents. Kannangara and two others

had been taken into custody along with the Appellant and the Appellant

had been granted bail.

06. It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that in the light of the

evidence adduced by the defence and the position taken by the defence, the

prosecution had failed to prove that the Appellant had knowledge that the

document in question was a forged one. He had merely handed over the

document to PW6 on the request of Officer Kannangara. Prosecution had

failed to prove the required Mens Rea, counsel submitted.

07. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the learned Trial Judge has

analyzed the evidence of the Appellant and that evidence was not sufficient

to create a reasonable doubt on the case for the prosecution.

08. Admittedly, the forged document in question had been handed over to

Gayan (PW6) by the Appellant. Whether the Appellant was aware or had

4

knowledge that it was a forged document has to be decided on the proved

circumstances. Court will have to see whether the Appellant had

knowledge that it was a forged document that he was carrying or whether

he carried it innocently without any knowledge of the forgery. However,

the aspect of negligence or keeping a blind eye also has to be considered.

09. In terms of section 462 of the Penal Code under which the Appellant was

charged, knowledge that the document is forged is an ingredient to be

proved. State must prove that that the Appellant possessed the document

(which is admitted) and also that he knew that it was a forged document.

Where the word 'knowledge' is included in the definition of an offence it

makes it plain that the doctrine of Mens Rea applies to that offence. (Sweet

V. Parsley [1970/ A.C. 132 at 149, R V. Hallam [1957/1 Q.B. 569)

10. Knowledge includes willfully shutting one's eyes to the truth. It is always

open to the trial Court to base a finding of knowledge on evidence that the

Accused had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained from

inquiry because he suspected the truth but did not wish to have his

suspicion confirmed. (Lord Bridge in Westminster City Council V.

Croya/grange Ltd, 83 Cr. App. R. 155 at 164)

11. "'Knowledge' is an awareness on the part of the person concerned

indicating his state of mind. ... 'Knowledge' will be slightly on higher

plane than 'reason to believe '. A person can be supposed to know where

there is a direct appeal to his senses and a person is presumed to have a

reason to believe if he has sufficient cause to believe the same. " (Joti

Prasad V. State of Haryana, 1993 Supp (2) SCC 497)

12. On knowledge, the Appellant has given clear and consistent evidence as to

how it made him carry the document in question on the request of

Kannangara to the clearance department. When the question arose, he had

promptly informed the authorities as to how it happened. Investigators on

the said information have recovered from Kannangara the material used by

Kannangara to make forged documents.

13. Admittedly, handing over the document to PW6 is not within the duties of

the Appellant. However, it was his evidence that there had been occasions

where the Police Officers assist known persons to get the matters expedited

(pages 165 and 166 of the appeal brief). In the circumstances one cannot

assume that the Appellant had knowledge that the document was a forged

one. In a criminal case suspicious circumstances alone do not establish

guilt. Nor does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances

relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the

Accused beyond reasonable doubt. (Queen V. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350)

14. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that on 3 occasions the Appellant

had lied in Court. On perusing the evidence, it in abundantly clear that

those answers were taken out from the Appellant in cross examination after

making the Appellant confused or misled by the counsel. They cannot be

considered as deliberate lies that would affect the credibility of the

Appellant.

15. In his judgment, the learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the defence

of lack of knowledge urged by the Appellant. The learned Trial Judge has

gone on the basis that it was not the duty of the Appellant to hand over the

documents to the clearance department (page 204). The learned Trial Judge

6

,

has only considered the element of possession, not the knowledge as

required (pages 204 and 205). Hence, the learned Trial Judge erred when

he found that the prosecution has proved the charge beyond reasonable

doubt. As the prosecution has failed to prove the element of 'knowledge'

beyond reasonable doubt, the conviction cannot be sustained. Both grounds

of appeal should succeed. I acquit the Appellant of the charge.

Appeal allowed.
