M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Matale seeking

inter alia a Declaration of Title in respect of the property described in

the schedule to the plaint and ejectment therefrom of the 1st and 2nd

Defendants-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents)

and all those who are holding under them from the property and also

damages and costs.

The Appellant, in his plaint pleaded that one A. O. Lechchimanan

Chettiar was the original owner of the property in suit, that he

transferred to K. A. Somasunderam by Deed No. 1389 dated 10.09.1951

attested by J. L. Thambiraja Notary Public. He further pleaded a series of

transactions and finally stated that, the 1st Defendant-Respondent

transferred the property in suit to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 9632 (P11)

dated 06.04.1991 attested by S. B. Wijeratne Notary Public.

3

It is also revealed from the plaint that the Appellant paid Rs. 50, 000/-

out of the agreed consideration at the time of execution of the Deed

while undertaking to pay the balance consideration when possession is

handed over on or before 31.05.1991. Therefore, it was the position of

the Appellant that the said possession was not handed over as promised

and that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent was in possession of the

building situated on the property.

The 2nd Defendant-Respondent had filed an answer and two amended

answers (vide: page 52 of the appeal brief). In the said second amended

answer the 2nd Defendant-Respondent pleaded that he executed a Deed

No. 3275 dated 23.12.1987 in favour of one Odayan Kureishan as a trust

to secure a loan which he got taken from the said Odayan Kureish. He

further stated that the husband of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent paid

to Odayan Kureishan the money which the 2nd Defendant-Respondent

owed to Odayan Kureishan and that Odayan Kureishan transferred to

the 1st Defendant-Respondent. Therefore, the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent had taken a position that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent

held the property in trust for the benefit of the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent. Thus, he prayed inter alia dismissal of the Appellants

action and a Declaration that the Appellant holds the property in trust

for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent.

In the above factual matrix, the learned District Judge fixed the case for

trial on 25 issues (vide: 56 to 61 of the appeal brief). Accordingly, after

conclusion of trial, the learned District Judge delivered the judgement on

25.06.1999 dismissing the action of the Appellant and granting reliefs as

prayed for in the answer of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent.

4

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, this appeal is preferred by the

Appellant to set aside the judgment and asking reliefs sought in the

plaint.

Having heard both parties, the main question which arises for

adjudication in this Appeal is whether the 2nd Defendant-Respondent is

entitled to claim that the Plaintiff is holding the property on Deed P11 in

a Constructive Trust in favour of the 2nd Defendant without first having

established that Odayan Kureishan held title by virtue Deed No. 3275

(P6) subjective to a Constructive Trust in favour of the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent.

To ascertain whether the Respondents were successful in establishing

the necessary ingredients to prove a constructive trust, a careful

attention on Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, No. 17 of 1917 as

amended subsequently is important.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance reads thus:

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and

it cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the

attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of the

beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must

hold such properly for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative.

It is the burden of the person who claims or tries to prove the cover

under the above Section 83 to establish that he/she did not intend to

dispose of the beneficial interest of the property transferred by the

5

deed, put in suit. Section 83 referred to above, permits Court to infer

such decision upon considering the attendant circumstances that led to

the execution of the deed. This accustomed position in law had been

discussed in many cases in the apex Courts. (See: Muttammah Vs.

Thiyagarajah [(1960) 62 NLR 559], Piyasena Vs. Vansue [(1997) 2 SLR

311], and Thisa Nona And Three Others Vs. Premedasa [(1997) 2 SLR

169]

In Muttammah Vs. Thiyagarajah (supra), it was held that,

Attendant Circumstances are to my mind circumstances

which precede or follow the transfer but are not too far

removed in point' of time to be regarded as attendant which

expression in this context may be understood as

accompanying" or "connected with". Whether a

circumstance is attendant or not would depend on the facts

of-each case (Page at 564)

Accordingly, Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance allows taking attendant

circumstances into account, which, if credible, may establish the

existence of a constructive trust.

Further, an important view was taken by the Supreme Court in the case

of Dayawathie And Other Vs. Sgunasekera & Another [(1991) 1SLR

115], where it was held that Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, No.

14 of 1895 as amended does not bar parole evidence to prove a

constructive trust and that the transferor did not intend to pass the

beneficial interest in property.

6

In this appeal, it was the position of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent that

the said Odayan Kureishan held title to the property in suit on Deed P6

on trust for the 2nd Defendant-Respondent. Therefore, in order to

establish that position the 2nd Defendant-Respondent had, necessarily to

lead evidence regarding attendant circumstances in respect of the said

deed. However, this Court observed that the said deed P6 had been

executed way back in 1987, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent never made

any attempt to challenge the said deed during the entire period of (more

than) 9 years which elapsed up to the institution of the instant action by

the Appellant.

In addition to the above backdrop, the Appellant brought an important

fact that the 2nd Defendant-Respondent did not so much as call either

Odayan Kuresihan or the Notary or any of the attesting witness to give

evidence regarding the said transaction. Therefore, the Appellant

strenuously has taken up an argument that the 2nd Defendant had failed

to establish that the said Odayan Kureishan held the property in trust for

him.

It is further observed that the learned District Judge had laid much

emphasis in arriving at his conclusion wide disparity between the values

of the consideration for Deed P6 by which the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent conveyed to Odayan Kureishan and the valuation given by

the Court Commissioner. However, after carful perusal of the evidence

on the valuation suggested there was no strong evidential since the

statements are mere opinions in per se.

7

Furthermore, it is important to note that the entire claim of the 2nd

Defendant-Respondent is based on the premise that Deed P6 by which

he conveyed the land and premises to Odayan Kureishan was subject to

an oral agreement to re-convey upon repayment of the consideration

which was purported to be a loan. However, this Court is in a view that

the 2nd Defendant-Respondent was not intensely entitled to lead parole

evidence to establish the purported oral agreements with Odayan

Kureishan to re-convey the property.

Therefore, I am of the view that the learned District Judge had failed to

concentrate on the fact that the 2nd Defendant has failed miserably to

establish on the parole evidence led, the existence of any such oral

agreement with Odayan Kureishan.

In the aforesaid reasons, I proceed to set aside the District Court

judgment dated 25.06.1999, and grant the reliefs to the Appellant

sought in the Plaint.

I make no order as to costs.

Appeal allowed.
