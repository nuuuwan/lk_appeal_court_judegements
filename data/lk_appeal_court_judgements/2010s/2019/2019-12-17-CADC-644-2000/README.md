Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendants claiming a

right of way to have access to his land over the land of the

defendants, as depicted in Lots 1-3 in Plan No.91/263 marked

P1. The defendants filed the answer seeking dismissal of the

plaintiffs action. After trial the District Judge delivered the

Judgment in favour of the plaintiff, except for damages. The

District Judge decided that the said right of way shall be 12 feet

in width. Being aggrieved by this Judgment, the defendants

have preferred this appeal.

Plan No.91/263 was prepared for the purpose of this case.

The plaintiff purchased her land, namely, Polkotuwa watta, by

deed marked P5 in 1981. The defendant purchased her land,

namely, Koangahamula watta/Kahalagoda watta, by deeds

marked P7 and P8 in 1986.

The complaint of the plaintiff is that the road depicted in Plan

No.91/263 was already there when the plaintiff purchased her

land; but after the defendant purchased her land, she

obstructed the plaintiff using that road.

The police complaint made in 1989 has been marked P9.

The section 66 application filed regarding this dispute has been

dismissed in 1990 on the basis that there was no breach of the

peace.

The plaintiff has produced inter alia two old Plans to

substantiate her positionPlan No.349 made in 1934 marked

P3, and Plan No.204 made in 1987 marked P4.

The surveyor who prepared Plan No.91/263, in his evidence, has

stated that the road depicted in that Plan had been obstructed.

Although there was no superimposition, he has also stated that

the road shown in Plan No.349 is similar to the disputed road.

Plan No.349 depicts Kirikosgahamula watta. According to Plan

91/263, Kirikosgahamula watta lies to the south of Lot 2 in that

Plan. The said Lot 2 is part of the disputed road. The surveyor

has also identified the road shown in Plan No.204.

Plan No.204 depicts the plaintiffs land, Polkotuwa watta. It has

been prepared for another case. The surveyor who prepared Plan

No.204, in his evidence, has stated that he went to the plaintiffs

land in his vehicle in order to prepare that Plan. That means

there had been a motorable road in 1987. It is the position of the

plaintiff that the surveyor drove along the disputed road.

The Gramaseva officer also has given evidence in favour of the

plaintiff regarding this road.

The road is also referred to in the deeds marked V5, V6, P14 etc.

Once the issues are raised, pleadings recede to the background.

Therefore, in view of issue No.5, granting a 12-foot-wide road

(instead of a 10-foot-wide road as pleaded in the plaint) by the

District Judge is not against the law.

The reasoning of the District Judge that when a servitude of

right of way becomes attached to a land, it passes to the new

owners of the land, despite it not being specially mentioned in

the deeds of transfer, is legally correct.

The District Court has considered that the road is also

necessary as a way of necessity. The defendants have not shown

any other usable alternative road although they have put it in

issue.

For the aforesaid reasons, there is no necessity to interfere with

the Judgment of the District Court.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
