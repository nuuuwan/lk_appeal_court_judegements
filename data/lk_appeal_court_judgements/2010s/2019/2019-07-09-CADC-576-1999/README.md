1O.05.20l9

The Plaintiff~Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiffs") filed

this action in the District Court of Gampola seeking the relief of a declaration of title

to the corpus more fully described in the schedule to the plaint. The averments in the

plaint were to the effect that since the latter part of 1990, the Defendant~Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") had encroached upon the land of

the Plaintiffs from the eastern boundary. The Plaintiffs further prayed that the Defendant

2

be evicted from the strip of land encroached upon and for damages in a sum of Rs.1,500/ ~

and for continuing damages in a sum of Rs.200/ ~ from the date of the plaint.

In his answer the Defendant traversed the cause of action of the Plaintiffs and further

pleaded that the Plaintiffs had cut down several trees which were on his land along the

western boundary causing damages in a sum of Rs.38,000/~.

When the trial was taken up on 08.12.1997, the Defendant was absent and unrepresented

and the learned District Judge fixed the matter for an ex parte trial on 05.0l. 1998. The ex

parte trial concluded on 05.Ol.1998 and judgment was delivered in favour of the Plaintiffs.

The ex parte judgment contains just two paragraphs devoid of any reasoning.

After the service of the ex parte decree, the Defendant sought to have the said ex parte

judgment set aside an inquiry under Section 86 was fixed for 02.03.1999.

When the inquiry to purge default was taken up on 02.03.1999, an application was made

by the Defendant to re~fix it, as his counsel was in a personal difficulty on that day.

The court did grant an adjournment re~fixing the inquiry for 14.06.1999 subject to the

condition that a sum of Rs.5,OOOr had to be paid to the Plaintiffs as a prepayment. The

Court also made order that if the order of prepayment is not complied with before

14.06.1999, the application made by the Defendant would be dismissed.

On the adjourned date namely 14.06.1999, the Defendant notified to court that the

prepayment ordered namely the sum of Rs.5,OOO/~ had been deposited to the credit of the

case and a receipt in proof thereof was produced.

The Counsel for the Plaintiffs objected to the course of action adopted by the Defendant

and the gravamen of the complaint was that the Defendant had not sought leave of court

to deposit the said sum of Rs.5,OOO/~ to the credit of the case.

Accordingly an argument was advanced before the learned District Judge that the failure

to make the prepayment in its proper way was in violation of the order made by Court on

2nd March 1999 and in the circumstances the Defendant's application must be dismissed

and judgment entered in favour of the Plaintiffs. Upon a perusal of the record it is quite

3

clear that J oumal Entry No.66 indicates that the Plaintiffs had moved Court to withdraw

the said deposit of prepayment that had been made to the credit of the case by the

Defendant.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid facts, the District Court proceeded to make the order on

27.07.1999 upholding the objections advanced by the Plaintiffs that the deposit of costs

to the credit of the case had caused inconvenience to the Plaintiffs and that the

Defendants act of making the payment to the credit of the case prevented the Plaintiff

from receiving the costs on or before 14.06.1999.

The Defendant preferred this appeal against this impugned order dated 27.07.1999 and

when this appeal was taken up in this Court for argument, the Plaintiffs raised the

preliminary objection that the Defendant does not enjoy a right of appeal under the

provisions of Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) as the said order has no

final effect and it does not fall within the definition of the judgment is provided for in

Section 754(5) of the cpc.

The SC decision of Chettiar v. Chettiar (2011) 2 Sri LR 70 was cited in order to drive

home the argument that a final appeal does not lie in this case. According to the facts in

that case, the action was dismissed under Section 46(2) of the CPC since the Plaintiff

had not complied with a positive rule of law in the drafting of the plaint. The merits of

the case had not been considered and the rights and liabilities of the parties had not been

determined. The case was dismissed by the District Court on a procedural lapse. In terms

of the English case of Salaman v. Warne! the English Court of Appeal had held that if

the decision is given in either way the case should be finally determined. But in this case

the objections were upheld and the action was dismissed. On the other hand if the

objections had been overruled, the case would have proceeded to trial. Shirani

Bandaranayake, J. (as Her Ladyship then was) did not follow the order approach adopted

in cases such as Shubruk v. Tufne1 and Bozson v. Altrinchan Urban District Council.3

1 (1891) 1 O.B. 734

2 (1889) OBO 621.

3 (1903) 1 K.B. 547 4

Instead Shirani Bandaranayake, J. cited with approval the judgments of Lord Esher MR

in Standard Discount Co v. La Grange4 and Salaman v. Warner (supra) which had

adopted the application approach that was also subsequently followed by Lord Denning J. in Salter Rex and Co v. Rosh.5

Therefore it was held in Chettiar v. Chettiar (supra) that the dismissal of the action was

not a final order or a judgment. So Chettiar v. Chettiar adopted the application

approach. Long prior to this in Ranjit v. Kusumawathie and Others,6 the application

approach had been adopted. This was a case where the District Court rejected an

application made by a defendant in terms of Section 48(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law

No.21 of 1977. The appellant then preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal in terms of

Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code on the basis that the order made by the

District Court was a 'Judgment". The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal on the basis

that what was appealed from was an "order" within the meaning of subsection 754(2) of

the CPC, and that therefore an appeal could lie only with leave of the Court of Appeal

first had and obtained. When an appeal was preferred therefrom to the Supreme Court,

Dheeraratne,J. affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that:~

"The order of the District Court is not a "judgment" within the meaning of sections 754 (1) and

754 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code for the purpose of an appeal. It is an "order" within the

meaning of section 754 (2) of the Code from which an appeal may be made with the leave of the

Court of Appeal first had and obtained".

As opposed to this was the test that was adopted by Sharvananda, J. (as His Lordship

then was) in Siriwardene v. Air Ceylon Ltd? "Where the appellant had filed an

application for leave to appeal from an Order of the District Judge made under section

189 of the Civil Procedure Code directing the amendment of a decree and the question

was whether such an order is one having the effect of a final judgment of a civil court for

4 (1877) 3 CPO 67.

5 (1971) 2 All E.R 865.

61998 (3) Sri L. R. 232

71984 (1) Sri L.R. 286 5

the purpose of determining whether the correct procedure should have been a direct

appeal and not an application for leave to appeal.

It was held that, "To decide whether a party dissatisfied with the order of a civil court

should lodge a direct appeal under section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code or appeal

with the leave of Court first had and obtained under section 754(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code, the definition of Judgment' and 'order' in section 754(5) should be

applied."

In view of the definition in Section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, the procedure of

direct appeal is available to a party dissatisfied not only with a judgment entered in

terms of Section 184 of the Civil Procedure Code but also with an order having the effect

of a final judgment, that is, a final order. Orders which are not judgments under Section

184 of the Civil Procedure Code or final orders are interlocutory orders from which a

party dissatisfied can appeal but only with leave to appeal.

As held by Sharvananda, J. (Colin Thome and Ranasinghe JJ. agreeing) in the case of

Siriwardene v. Air Ceylon Ltd (supra), the tests to be applied to determine whether an

order has the effect of a final judgment and so qualifies as a judgment under Section

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code are:~

1) "It must be an order finally disposing of the rights of the parties.

2) The order cannot be treated as a final order, if the suit or the action is still left a

live suit or action for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of the

parties in the ordinary way.

3) The finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit.

4) The mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even a vital and

important issue determined in the case, is not enough to make an order a final

one."

By these tests, an order amending a decree made under Section 189 of the Civil Procedure

Code is a final order. Hence, the appellant's application for leave to appeal was

misconceived and could not be entertained".

Both these tests came up before a seven bench decision of the Supreme Court in

Mohamed Woleed Mohamed Zawahir v. Amana Takaful Company Ltd SC CHC

Appeal No.37/2008 (SC minutes of 04.08.2017) wherein in an exhaustive judgment, His

Lordship the Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, P.C laid down that appeals could be filed in

respect of judgments or orders which are final judgments. In respect of other orders

which are not final and considered as interlocutory orders leave to appeal applications

have to be filed.

His Lordship the Chief Justice further held that judgments fall into two categories and

similarly orders too would fall into two categories.

a) Judgments which are final judgments.

b) Judgments which are not final.

c) Orders which are final judgments.

d) Orders which are interlocutory orders.

The Divisional Bench held that appeals could be filed in respect of judgments or orders

that are final. In respect of other orders leave it has to be first obtained. Therefore, His

Lordship the Chief Justice held that it is not the name given as a judgment or order that

matters but it is the finality of the judgment or order that matters.

Adopting this rationale, could the order made in this case on the 2th July 1999 be

described as having the effect of a final judgment? The learned District Judge titles his

decision as an order. But this appellation does not matter. What matters is the finality of

the order. If the order made on 2th July 1999 entails the consequences of a final

judgment, then an appeal would definitely lie against that order.

The order dated 2th July 1999 quite categorically shuts out the defendant from

participating at an inter partes trial. The order does not give him an opportunity to

participate at the trial even though he had made the prepayment but in a way not

prescribed in the order. Money payable lies in Court and there is no impediment to

secure this money. In fact the Plaintiffs had made the application to the money. If the

Defendant had made the payment, he should be allowed to participate at the trial. It can

7

be easily verified whether money had been paid to Court and that nobody disputes the

payment on the part of the Defendant.

In my view thus came to an end any prospect of an inter partes trial proceeding to a

conclusion. If one interprets the order made by the learned District Judge of Gampola, it

would appear that the door to justice is all but shut to the defendant. A final judgment

must decide the rights and liabilities of parties. In this case the learned District Judge has

decided not to proceed further with the purge default inquiry and thus there is no

alternative for the defendant but to prefer this appeal. It would appear that the

impugned order dated 27.07.1999 has finally settled the litigation between the Plaintiffs

and the Defendant.

In the circumstances I take the view that the order made by the learned District Judge on

2th July 1999 refusing participation at the purge default inquiry because the manner or

mode of payment was wrong case the form of a final order which is appealable.

So I would overrule the preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this appeal and

proceed to set aside the order of the learned District Judge dated 27.07.1999.

As regards the propriety of the mode of payment of the cost was never argued before me

and therefore the argument on the propriety or otherwise of the mode of payment must

be taken to have been waived. If the payment had been made to the credit of the case, it is

open to the Plaintiffs to withdraw the money from Courts. In such a situation the

application made by the Defendant to participate at the purge~default inquiry must be

allowed and direct the learned District Judge to conduct a purge~default inquiry to

satisfy himself whether the Defendant shows reasonable grounds for default. Relying on

the outcome of the purge default inquiry, the learned District Judge of Gampola is directed

to take steps according to law.

In the circumstances I allow the appeal of the Defendant~Appeliant.
