The Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Wayamba

Province holden in Chilaw dated 26.01.2015 in Case No. HCR 20/2013 and

seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of

Marawila dated 28.08.2013 in Case No. 70591/C.

Facts of the case:

The Police, Koswatta arrested the accused-driver on or about 07.08.2012 for

illegally transporting Teak wood valued at Rs. 129,354/- without a valid permit.

The vehicle bearing No. P A - 8222 which was utilized for the transportation was

taken into custody by the Police.

The accused-driver was charged before the Learned Magistrate of Marawila, for

illegally transporting Teak wood, an offence punishable under section 25(2) read

with sections 38A, 40, 40A and 25(2)(a) of the Forest Ordinance as amended. The

accused-driver pleaded guilty to the said charge and the Learned Magistrate

imposed a fine ofRs. 30,000 with a default sentence of 6 months imprisonment.

Page 30f9

Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held w~th regard to the vehicle used for

committing of the offence. The Claimant-Petitioner-Appellant who is the

registered owner of the vehicle (hereinafter referred to as 'the appellant') gave

evidence in the said inquiry. The Learned Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by the

order dated 28.08.2013.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court ofWayamba Province holden in Chilaw. The

Learned High Court Judge dismissed the said application by the order dated

26.01.2015.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal in

written submissions;

1. The Learned Magistrate failed to take into consideration the fact that the

appellant has taken precautions to prevent the use of vehicle for an offence.

2. The Learned Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the appellant

has taken every measure to ensure that the vehicle was not used for illegal

purposes.

3. The Learned Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the said illicit

transportation of timber took place without the knowledge of the appellant.

4. The Learned Magistrate failed to take into consideration the nature of degree

of proof required by the appellant.

5. The Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge failed to take

into consideration that the appellant and the accused are not habitual

offenders and have no previous convictions.

6. The Learned Magistrate wrongly insisted upon corroboration of the

testimony of the appellant in deciding the matter.

Page 4 of9

It was the contention of the Learned Counsel.for the appellant that in the inquiry,

the appellant proved that she took every measure to ensure the vehicle was not

used for illegal purposes, even during the date of the alleged offence. On the date

of offence, the appellant's husband had to go to a medical clinic and therefore the

accused-driver was asked to transport two loads of Gneiss. The driver came with

one load of Gneiss and went back to pick the second load. The appellant tried to

contact the driver in the evening and the appellant's husband went on searching for

the driver when the driver was late to return home.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has conSistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was

committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

After the enactment of Act No. 65 of 2009 which amended section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, a vehicle owner in question should prove precautions taken by himlher

to prevent an offence being committed, on a balance of probability.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeal 105A12008 -decided on

02.07.2009], it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Page 5 of9

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the

r satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio decidendi of

all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has to establish

the said matter on a balance of probability. "

In the case of K.W.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura and another [CA (PHC) 89/2013], it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance,

making use of that vehicle ... "

In light of above, it is understood that even though the previous law allowed a

vehicle owner to prove either he took precautions or he had no knowledge of an

offence being committed, the amended section 40 only focuses on the precautions

taken by a vehicle owner in question.

Now I will consider whether the Learned Magistrate failed to consider that the

appellant has taken every measure to ensure the vehicle was not used for illegal

purposes. I observe that the appellant had testified as follows;

The appellant has taken this position throughout her evidence. It was elicited from

the appellant's evidence that the vehicle was under her control and it was given to

the accused-driver only if her husband was unable to drive it.

At this juncture I wish to consider whether the reasons given by the Learned

Magistrate to confiscate the vehicle was justifiable. The Learned Magistrate made

following observations;

I observe that the appellant clearly testified that she was monitoring the vehicle

whenever it was given to the accused-driver. The appellant has contacted the driver

twice on that day as well. Therefore I am of the view that the Learned Magistrate

misdirected in evaluating the evidence since the appellant clearly testified that she

took precautions within her capability.

In the case of W.M.F.G. Fernando V. Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.II08/99 (F) - decided on 02.08.2013], it was held that,

"It is trite law that the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory in

nature, and that the object is the proper administration of justice. In

Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice

and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a party who is entitled to it, may claim to have as

of right, and its object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order

of court which is tainted by error. .. "

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and Others (2004) 1 Sri LR 284, it was

held that:

" ... to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have

occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which is beyond

Page 8 of9

an error or defect or irregularity tha{ an ordinary person would instantly

react to it ... the order complained of is of such a nature which would have . shocked the conscience of the court. "

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned Magistrate erred in coming

to the conclusion that the appellant had not proved precautions taken by her, to the

satisfaction of Court and it clearly caused a miscarriage of justice. I am of the view

that it was an exceptional circumstance for the High Court to invoke the

revisionary powers, but the Learned High Court Judge failed to observe the error

on the part of the Learned Magistrate.

Therefore I decide to set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

26.01.2015 and confiscation order of the Learned Magistrate dated 28.08.2013. I

order the vehicle to be released to the appellant.

Accordingly the appeal is hereby allowed.
