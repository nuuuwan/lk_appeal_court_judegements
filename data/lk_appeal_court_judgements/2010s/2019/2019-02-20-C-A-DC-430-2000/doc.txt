Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the 9th defendant-appellant (appellant)

against the Judgment of the District Court dated 17.07.2000.

This is a partition action. Whilst the case was in progress, the

appellant intervened. She was made the 9th defendant and

proxy filed.1 However she never filed a statement of claim. In

the statement of claim of the 3rd and 6A defendants (with whom

the appellant is sailing together) and filed by the same registered

Attorney of the appellant2, it is stated in paragraph 9 that

Jamis Singho referred to in paragraphs 4 and 6 of the plaint,

transferred the rights which he got from the Judgment in case

No.4702 to Rajapaksha Arachchilage Dharmawathie Manike (the

appellant) by Deed No. 1650 dated 11.01.1984. Based on this

averment, the registered Attorney for the appellant raised issue

No. 23 at the trial.3 However, the appellant never produced the

said Deed No. 1650 either before the District Court or before this

Court as fresh evidence in appeal. Even in the written

submissions filed before the District Court, the Attorney for the

appellant never relied on Deed No. 1650. He made no

submissions on that Deed to the District Judge.4 Therefore, the

learned District Judge rightly answered issue No. 23 in the

negative.

The appellant raised no more issues in the District Court and

therefore, in my view, the matter shall end there.

However, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

before this Court seeks to set aside the Judgment of the District

Court on the premise that the learned District Judge has failed

to investigate title to the land properly. I totally disagree with

that line of argument. Without producing the Deed, in my view,

that argument is meaningless. If that argument is accepted, any

third party who has no interest whatsoever in the land, can

attack the partition Judgment on that basis.

It is also noteworthy that the registered Attorney for the

appellant, by paragraph 3 of the aforesaid statement of claim

and by issue No. 22, took up the strong position that the

Judgment in case No.4702 operates as res judicata. However,

the appellant before this Court takes up the completely opposite

position and states that it does not operate as res judicata may

be having now realized that the position taken up before the

District Court on that point is unfavourable to her. The

appellant cannot do it.

It is settled law that no party can be allowed to make at the trial

a case materially different from what he has placed on record.

(vide Hildon v. Munaweera [1997] 3 Sri LR 220, YMBA v. Abdul

Azeez 1997 BALJ 7, Ranasinghe v. Somawathie [2004] 2 Sri LR

154)

Explanation 2 to section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code reads

thus:

The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the

party's pleading, i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be.

And no party can be allowed to make at the trial a case

materially different from that which he has placed on

4

record, and which his opponent is prepared to meet. And

the facts proposed to be established must in the whole

amount to so much of the material part of his case as is not

admitted in his opponents pleadings.

In parity of reasoning, Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva in Candappa

nee Bastian v. Ponnambalampillai [1993] 1 Sri LR 184 stated that

the above principle can safely be applied in appeals too, if a

party tries to present a case materially different from the case

presented before the Trial Court.

Thus it is seen that the position taken up in appeal for the

first time was not in accord with the case as presented by

the defendant in the District Court. It is well to bear in mind

the provisions of explanation 2 to section 150 of the Civil

Procedure Code. It reads thus: The case enunciated must

reasonably accord with the party's pleading, i.e. plaint or

answer, as the case may be. And no party can be allowed

to make at the trial a case materially different from that

which he has placed on record, and which his opponent is

prepared to meet ...... A fortiori, a party cannot be

permitted to present in appeal a case different from the

case presented before the trial Court except in accordance

with the principles laid down by the House of Lords in The

Tasmania (1890) 15 App. Cases 233 and followed by Dias,

J. in Setha v. Weerakoon 49 NLR 225, 228, 229.

In Janashakthi Insurance Co. Ltd v. Umbichy Ltd [2007] 2 Sri LR

39 the Supreme Court reiterated the above position.

5

The defendant-appellant is prohibited from setting up a

different case from that set up at the trial, he cannot take

up a case in appeal which differs from that of the trial.

The submission of learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

centers around on two Deeds: the Deed No. 18672 marked P2 by

the plaintiff in evidence whereby the plaintiff got rights to the

land to be partitioned from James Singho; and the appellants

Deed No. 1650, which was never produced. His submission is

that the District Judge was wrong and by Deed No.18672

James Singho can only give 1/3 share.5 However, by Deed No.

1650, James Singho has transferred to the plaintiff only

share6 and therefore there is nothing wrong in that transfer.

This appeal is absolutely devoid of merit. Appeal is dismissed.

The appellant shall pay a sum of Rs.50,000/= as costs of this

appeal to the substituted plaintiff.
