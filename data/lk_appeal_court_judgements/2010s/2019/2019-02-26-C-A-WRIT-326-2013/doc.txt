The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to register the name of the 4th

Respondent as the owner of a State land;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from interfering with

the Petitioner's possession of the said land;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to convey the

ownership of the aforementioned land to the Petitioner.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The State had issued a permit in terms of the Land Development Ordinance

(the Ordinance) to the grandfather of the Petitioner, Edwin Rosa in 1949. A

copy of the said permit has been produced by the 1st Respondent, marked

'lRl'. The said permit covered a high land in extent of 3A 2R 18P and a paddy

land in extent of 4A 2R 38 perches. The dispute that is to be decided in this

application relates to the paddy land.

According to the permit marked 'lRl' Edwin Rosa had initially nominated his

son Joseph Rosa as the successor. The Petitioner is the son of Joseph Rosa. The

nomination of Joseph Rosa has been registered in the land ledger produced by

the 1st Respondent marked 'lR2'. However, by a further endorsement made on

'lR2' on 27th August 1963, the name of Joseph Rosa had been deleted and the

name of Benjamin Rosa, the 4th Respondent, who is also a son of Edwin Rosa,

had been substituted. Edwin Rosa died on 1st March 1979, leaving behind his

widow, Lucia Fernando and children.

The 1st Respondent states that in terms of Section 48A(1) of the Ordinance,

upon the death of Edwin Rosa, Lucia Fernando was entitled to succeed to the

lands set out in 'lRl'. Section 48A(1) of the Ordinance reads as follows:

((Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death

was required to pay any annual instalments by virtue of the provisions of

subsection (2) of section 19, notwithstanding default in the payment of

such instalments, the spouse of that permit-holder, whether he or she has

or has not been nominated as successor by that permit-holder, shall be

entitled to succeed to the land alienated to that permit-holder on the

permit and the terms and conditions of that permit shall be applicable to

that spouse"

The name of Lucia Fernando had been registered as the permit holder on 10th

August 1980. This is borne out by the endorsement made on 'lRl' as well as by

the letter dated 18th March 2009 issued by the 1st Respondent. 1

On 31st January 1983, Lucia Fernando had been issued with a grant in terms of

Section 19(4) of the Ordinance read together with Section 19(6) thereof, in

respect of the paddy land. A copy of the said grant has been annexed to the

petition marked 'PS'. Provision to issue a grant to Lucia Fernando in respect of

1 This letter has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P7a'.

the said land is contained in Section 48A(2) of the Ordinance, which reads as

follows:

"If, during the lifetime of the spouse of a deceased permit-holder who has

succeeded under subsection (1) to the land alienated on the permit, the

terms and conditions of the permit are complied with by such spouse,

such spouse shall be entitled to a grant of that land subject to the

following conditions:

(a) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of the land alienated by

the grant;

(b) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that land;

(c) upon the death of such spouse, or upon his or her marriage, the

person, who was nominated as successor by the deceased permit

holder or who would have been entitled to succeed as his successor,

shall succeed to that land:

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a grant of any

land to be made to a spouse who has been nominated by the deceased

permit-holder to succeed to the land alienated on the permit."

There is no dispute among the parties that Lucia Fernando had not been

named as a successor by Edwin Rosa. Thus, while the above proviso would not

apply, the conditions set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would apply to Lucia

Fernando. Section 48A(3) of the Ordinance further specifies that, 'any

I[, I

~.

f

disposition or nomination made by a spouse in contravention of the provisions

of subsection (2) shall be invalid.'

The Petitioner has produced with the petition, marked as 'P6a' - 'P6e', the

extracts relating to the said land taken from the Register of the grants issued

under the Ordinance. According to 'P6a', on 29th July 1991, Lucia Fernando had

nominated Seemon Rosa and Benjamin Rosa as her successors under the said

grant. On 15th June 2004, Lucia Fernando had nominated as her successors,

Benjamin Rosa and the Petitioner. This is reflected in the document marked

'P6b'. However, according to 'P6e', on 19th May 2005, the 1st Respondent had

registered Benjamin Rosa as the sole owner of the said land.

The grievance of the Petitioner arose upon the name of Benjamin Rosa being

registered as the sole owner of the said land and culminated with the filing of

this application by the Petitioner seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said

registration.

The first argument of the Petitioner is that the cancellation of the nomination

of his father Joseph Rosa and the substitution of Benjamin Rosa as successor is

bad in law. If this Court agrees with the Petitioner, then, by virtue of the

Petitioner being the eldest son of Joseph Rosa, he is entitled to succeed to the

said land. The 1st Respondent has produced marked as '1Rl' a Sinhala copy of

the permit issued to Edwin Rosa as well as an English copy of the said permit.

While the reverse of the Sinhala copy of '1Rl' only contains the name of

Benjamin Rosa as the successor, the English copy of '1Rl' contains the name of

Joseph Rosa, which has been subsequently deleted and the name of Benjamin

Rosa has been inserted as the successor. This endorsement has been signed on

behalf of the Assistant Government Agent and the date has been inserted. The

said amendment of the nominee has been effected in the land ledger, a copy

of which has been produced by the 1st Respondent, marked 'IR2', on the same

day that the amendment was made on the permit 'IRl'. In these

circumstances, this Court cannot agree with the submission of the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner that the cancellation of the name of Joseph Rosa as

nominee and the substitution of Benjamin Rosa is not in accordance with the

law.

The second argument of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent must give

effect to the nomination made by Lucia Fernando and that in terms of the said

nomination, as reflected in 'P6b', the Petitioner is entitled to receive 1A 2R SP

from the paddy land. It is the position of the 1st - 3rd Respondents that Lucia

Fernando only held a life interest over the said land and that in terms of

Section 48A(2)(b) of the Ordinance, Lucia Fernando had no power to nominate

a successor. Accordingly, it was submitted that in terms of Section 48A(3) of

the Ordinance, the said nomination by Lucia Fernando shall be invalid. This

Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned State Counsel that

the nominations made by Lucia Fernando including the nomination of the

Petitioner as a successor, is bad in law. This Court is of the view that in terms of

Section 48A(2)(c) of the Ordinance, upon the death of Lucia Fernando,

Benjamin Rosa, who had been nominated as the successor by Edwin Rosa was

entitled to succeed.

There is one other matter that this Court would like to advert to, with regard

to the validity of a nomination made under a permit, where a grant has

subsequently been issued. In Mallehe Widanaralalage Don Dayaratne vs

Mallehe Widanaralalage Don Agosinno and four others2 the question arose

whether a nomination made under a permit continued to be valid once a grant

had been issued in respect of the same land. The Supreme Court had held as

follows:

" ...... The fact that his interest is converted from that of a permit to a

grant cannot make a variation in the wish that has been already indicated

by him to the relevant authority. There is no provision in the Land

Development Ordinance which has the effect of annulling the nomination

that has been made by a holder of any lot. On an examination of the

scheme of the sections, in particular, section 19(4) referred to in P7 itself,

it is clear that the permit holder's right fructifies to a grant upon the

satisfaction of certain conditions. The conversion of the character of the

holdings cannot have the effect of annulling the nomination that has been

validly made.

In these circumstances, we are of the view that the 1st Respondent has

made the order P7 on proper application of the relevant provisions and

importantly, by giving effect to the wish of the deceased allottee ..... "

The facts of the present application are slightly different to that of Dayaratne's

case in that the nomination of Benjamin Rosa was done under a permit held by

Edwin Rosa but the grant had been issued to Lucia Fernando. However, this

Court is of the view that, that does not affect the applicability of the judgment

of the Supreme Court to this application. The nomination of Benjamin Rosa as

2 SC Appeal No.30/2004; SC Minutes of 23rd March 2005. The judgment of the Supreme Court has been referred to and followed in Abeysinghe Arachchige Asoka vs Rajapakse, Commissioner General of Lands rCA (Writ) Application No. 208/2013; CA Minutes of 2nd September 2016). I!I I , ;

the successor of Edwin Rosa was in force at the time of Edwin Rosa's death.

This Court is of the view that the subsequent recognition of Lucia Fernando as

the successor under the permit 'lRl' and the issuance of the grant IpS' in

favour of Lucia Fernando was a continuation of the rights of Edwin Rosa under

the permit and did not affect the validity of the aforesaid nomination made by

Edwin Rosa. Thus, the nomination of Benjamin Rosa as the successor

continued to be valid and Benjamin Rosa was entitled to succeed to the said

land in terms of the Ordinance.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the registration of the

name of Benjamin Rosa in the Register of grants as reflected in 'P6e' is in terms

of the law and hence, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue the Writ

of Certiorari prayed for by the Petitioner. The necessity to consider the Writs

of Prohibition and Mandamus does not therefore arise. This application of the

Petitioner is dismissed, without costs.
