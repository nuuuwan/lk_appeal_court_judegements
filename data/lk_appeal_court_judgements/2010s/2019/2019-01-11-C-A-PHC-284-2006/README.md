This is an appeal filed by the Petitioner -Respondent -Petitioner (the

Appellant) against the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden at Puttalam.

2

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

In October 1998, the State had issued Marasinghe Arachchige Sumanaratne a

grant under Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance in respect of a

land in extent of 0.768 hectares situated within the Grama Niladhari division of

Baranankattuwa in the district of Puttalam. The said land had been described

in the said G!ant as being Lot NO.6 of Plan No. 9s/14/{:f/431

. The boundaries

given in the Grant had been amended by a letter dated 8th December 1998

issued by the Divisional Secretary of Mahakumbukkadawela. This Court

observes that this letter sets out the amended boundaries of the land r.eferred

to in the Grant but does not have a reference to any Plan. This Court also

observes that there is 'a slight discrepancy in the extent of the land between

what is given in the Grant and the said letter. However, by a subsequent letter

issued in 20052, the Divisional Secretary had reverted to the boundaries and

the extent given in the Grant, thereby removing any ambiguity in this regard.

Although Sumanaratne was not resident on this land after 2003, he is said to

have cultivated this land and had been in possession of this land until he

passed away on 13th August 2004. After the passing away of Sumanaratne, the

Appellant, who is the widow of Sumanaratne appears to have claimed the said

land. By letter dated 15th June 2005, the Secretary, Ministry of Lands,

Agriculture, Irrigation and Animal Production Services of the North Western

Provincial Council had confirmed that the Appellant is entitled to the life

interest under the G rant. The life interest in favour of the Appellant has been

registered on 29

th June 2005, as borne out by a letter dated 28th June .2005

issued by the Divisional Secretary, Mahakumbukkadawela. This Court observes

1 A copy of the said Plan has been produced in the Magistrate's Court marked 'V3'.

2 Letter dated 28th June 2005, marked 'X10'.

that, the boundaries of the land given in this letter are the same boundaries

given in the Grant.

On 29th May 2005, the Appellant, had lodged a complaint with the Mundalama

Police Station. In the said complaint, she stated that after the death of

Sumanaratne, she was in the habit of visiting the said land every week,

presumably to pluck coconuts as she says she was living on the income from

the said land. She had stated further that while she was away, the said

property was kept urider lock and key. The Appellant had stated further that

when she visited the said land on 29th May 2005, she found that the mother of

Sumanaratne and the sister of Sumanaratne who is the Respondent -

Petitioner - Respondent (the Respondent) had broken the padlock and forcibly

entered the said land and was occupying the said land. The relevant portions

of the said statement are re-produced below:

~~ene:. ~Q)@Q)tn ~@) @cs5DQe:> @@Jtn CDO@) ffi@@~."

On 8th June 2005, the Appellant had filed a petition supported with an affidavit

in terms of Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of

1979 (the Act), in the Primary Court of Puttalam.

Section 66(1)(b) of the Act reads as follows:

"Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely, any party to such dispute may file an information by

affidavit in such Primary Court setting out the facts and the relief sought

and specifying as respondents the names and addresses of the other

parties to the dispute and then such court shall by its usual process or by

registered post notice the parties named to appear in court on the day

specified in the notice-such day being not later than two weeks from the

day on which the information was filed."

Thus, it is clear that there are two conditions which must be satisfied in order

for the Primary Court Judge to assume jurisdiction; that is, there must be a

dispute affecting land and a breach of the peace should be threatened or likely

owing to the said dispute.

In addition to the aforementioned facts, the Appellant had stated in her

petition and affidavit that she had a permanent house and a cadjan hut on the

said land and that after the death of Sumanaratne, she had continued with the

cultivation and continued to be in possession of the said land until 29th May

2005. She had stated that the Respondent and a few others were forcibly

occupying the said property, having entered the property by breaking the gate.

She had stated further that her belongings had been thrown allover the land

and had produced a photograph as proof. The Appellant had also stated as

follows:

Thus, on the face of it, the affidavit of the Appellant had satisfied the

aforementioned two conditions set out in Section 66(1}(b) of the Act. The

learned Primary Court Judge had accordingly issued notices on the

Respondent.

The Respondent had filed her objections supported with an affidavit, to which

she had annexed the Plan referred to in the grant.3 This Court observes that

except for a general denial of the averments in the affidavit of the Appellant,

the Respondent had not specifically answered any of the matters in the said

affidavit nor had she specifically denied a breach of the peace, either

threatened or likely. The Respondent had however raised a preliminary

objection that what had arisen between the Appellant and herself was only a

civil dispute which she claimed should be resolved through a civil court,

without any further elaboration in this regard.

The Respondent took up the position that her family had permitted

Sumanaratne to carryon a koppara business on the said land but that

Sumanaratne had left the said land in 2003. She stated further that thereafter

she has been in possession of Lot Nos. 5 and 6 in the said Plan. The

Respondent had also annexed a letter dated 22nd December 2004, written by

her to the District Secretary of Puttalam after the death of Sumanaratne,

where she had stated as follows:

3 A copy of the Plan had been annexed, marked 'VI' .

This statement demonstrates that the Respondent was not in possession of the

said lots of land but was seeking to prevent the Appellant from acquiring any

rights under the Grant, thus confirming the position of the Appellant that she

was in possession of the said land even after the death of Sumanaratne.

The learned Primary Court Judge had carried out a site inspection on ih

November 2005, in the presence of the Appellant and the Respondent and

their respective Attorneys-at-Law. The learned Primary Court Judge had made

the following observations regarding the site:

The above observation of the learned Primary Court Judge confirms the

position of the Appellant that the 2nd Respondent had only recently occupied

the premises in question.

The power of the Primary Court where the dispute relates to the possession of

any land is set out . in Section 68, the relevant provisions of which are re-

produced below:

Section 68(1): "Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding

the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the land or the

part on the date of the filing of the information under section 66 and

make order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part

thereof."

Section 68(3): "Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to

the possession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary

Court is satisfied that any person who had been in possession of the land

or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months

immediately before the date on which the information was filed under

section 66, he may make a determination to that effect and make an

order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to possessi~n and

prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent court./I

The manner in which Sections 68(1) and 68(3) of the Act are to be applied have

been laid down in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ramalingam vs

Thangarajah4 where it was held as follows:

In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land, where a

breach of peace is threatened or is likely under Part VII, of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, the main point for decision is the actual possession

of the land on the date of the filing of the information under section 66;

but, where forcible dispossession took place within two months before

the date on which the said information was filed the main point is, actual

possession prior to that alleged date of dispossession. Section 68 is only

concerned with the determination as to who was in possession of the land

or the part on the date of the filing of the information under section 66. It

directs the Judge to declare that the person who was in such possession

was entitled to possession of the land or part thereof. Section 68(3)

becomes applicable only if the Judge can come to a definite finding that

some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two

months next proceeding the date on which the information was filed

under section 66. The effect of this sub-section is that it enables a party to

be treated to be in possession on the date of the filing of the information

though actually he may be found to have been dispossessed before that

date provided such dispossession took place within the period of two

months next preceding the date of the filing of the information. It is only

if such a party can be treated or deemed to be in possession on the date

of the filing of the information that the person actually in possession can

be said not to have been in possession on the date of the filing of the

4 1982 (2) Sri LR 693

a

information. Thus, the duty of the Judge in proceedings under section 68

is to ascertain which party was or deemed to have been in possession on

the relevant date, namely, on the date of the filing of the information

under section 66.

That person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by due process of

law. A Judge should therefore in an inquiry under Part VII of the aforesaid

Act, confine himself to the question of actual possession on the date of

filing of the info'rmation except in a case where a person who had been in

possession of the land had been dispossessed within a period of two

months immediately before the date of the information."

The order of the Primary Court was delivered on 14th December 2005. In the

said Order, she had pointed out that the purpose of an application under

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is to resolve land disputes

where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely and that in terms of

Sections 68(1) and 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the person who

can establish that he/she was in possession of the property upto two months

prior to the date of having been dispossessed is entitled to the possession of

the said property

The learned Primary Court Judge had proceeded to hold that Sumanaratne had

been in possession of the said land from 1994 until his death and that

thereafter the Appellant had come into possession of the said land, as borne

out by the letter dated 31st May 2005 issued by the Grama Niladhari. Sh had

stated further that other than her own affidavit and the affidavits of her family

members, the Respondent had failed to produce any independent evidence to

establish that she was in possession of the said land. The learned Primary

Court Judge, having come to the conclusion that the Appellant had been in

possession of the said land and that she had been dispossessed by the

Respondent, granted possession of the said land to the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Respondent filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of the

North Western province, holden at Puttalam. The complaint of the Respondent

to the High Court was twofold; firstly that the learned Primary Court Judge

could not have made an order under Section 66(1)(b) of the Act as there was

no evidence of a breach of the peace; and secondly that the land which is the

subject matter of the 'action has not been identified correctly.

The Learned High Court Judge, by his judgment delivered on t h December

2006 upheld the said objections and allowed the revision application of the

Respondent. In his judgment, the learned High Court Judge had pointed out

that power has been conferred on Primary Courts to inquire into disputes

affecting land only where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely and

hence, it is mandatory that evidence of such a breach of the peace is presented

to Court. He had proceeded to hold that although a land dispute between two

law abiding citizens must be resolved by a district court, the Primary Court has

been conferred this special jurisdiction to resolve a land dispute between two

persons who are not law abiding citizens which can lead to a breach of the

peace and that therefore, a breach of the peace being threatened or likely is a

pre-condition to the Primary Court exercising jurisdiction in land disputes.

The learned High Court Judge had thereafter stated that when an application is

filed in terms of Section 66{1}{a) of the Act by the Police, the question of

whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely is decided by the Police

but when an application is filed in terms of Section 66{1}{b) of the Act, the first

matter that Court must be satisfied is whether there is evidence to establish

that a breach of the peace is threatened or likely.

The learned High Court Judge had held that the evidence before him

demonstrates that there is only a land dispute between the parties and that

there is no evidence that a breach of the peace is threatened or likely. On that

basis, he had held that the Primary Court does not have the jurisdiction to

inquire into the application filed by the Appellant.

As referred to at the beginning of this judgement, the boundaries of the land

set out in the Grant have been amended subsequently. Thus, the Appellant

had amalgamated the different boundaries when referring to the land in her

petition to the Primary Court. The learned High Court Judge had held that the

Appellant has failed to explain why she amalgamated the boundaries set out in

the Grant and the subsequent amendment to the boundaries set out in letter

dated 8th December 1998. The learned High Court had also adverted to the

failure on the part of the Appellant to explain the boundaries of the land which

is the subject matter of the dispute and had noted that there is a difficulty in

identifying the land which is the subject matter of the dispute. While it is not

clear as to how the amalgamated boundaries affected the Appellant's case, it

does not appear that the Appellant or her husband had any control or even an

explanation to offer to this amendment of boundaries.

1)

This Court observes that the learned High Court Judge has not arrived at any

finding with regard to the possession of the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the

Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the said judgment of the

High Court. The two matters that this Court must therefore consider is

whether th~re was evidence that a breach of the peace was threatened or

likely as a result of the acts of the Respondent and secondly, whether there

exists any ambiguity with regard to the boundaries of the land in dispute and if

so whether that is a ground to reject an application under Section 66(1)(b) of

the Act.

This Court is in agreement with the learned High Court Judge that for a Primary

Court to assume jurisdiction under Section 66(1)(b) of the Act, a breach of the

peace must be threatened or likely. This matter has been considered by this

Court in Punchi Nona vs Padumasenas where it was held as follows:

"Section 68(1) of the Act is concerned with the determination as to who

was in possession of the land on the date of the filing of the information

to Court. Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge can come to

a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of two months next preceding the date on which the

information was filed6.

However, when an information is filed by a party to the dispute under

section 66(1) (b) it is left to the judge to satisfy himself that there is a

5 1994 (2) Sri LR 117.

6 At page 121.

dispute affecting land owing to which a breach of the peace is threatened

or likely. As observed in Velupillai and Others v. Sivanathan7

II ... when an

information is filed under section 66(1)(b) the only material that the

Magistrate would have before him is the affidavit information of an

interested person and in such a situation without the benefit of further

assistance from a police report, the Magistrate should proceed cautiously

and asc;ertain for himself whether there is a dispute affecting land and

wh~ther a breach of the peace is threatened or likely.8

The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a

breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The

Court in exercisin'g this jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into

title or the right to possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is

required to take action of a preventive and provisional nature pending

final adjudication of rights in a civil Court. It was therefore incumbent

upon the Primary Court Judge to have initially satisfied himself as to

whether there was a threat or likelihood of a breach of peace and

whether he was justified in assuming such a special jurisdiction under the

circumstances. The failure of the judge to satisfy himself initially in regard

to the threat or likelihood of the breach of peace deprived him of the

jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry."g

The position of the Appellant that she was in possession of the said land two

months prior to 29th May 2005 and that the Appellant had been dispossessed

from the said land has been accepted by the learned Primary Court Judge. As

7 1993 (1) SLR 123

8 At page 122

9 At page 122

set out earlier, the judgment of the learned High Court Judge does not

controvert this finding of the learned Primary Court Judge.

Taking this as the starting point, the evidence of the Appellant is that when she

visited the land on 29th May 2005, she found that the padlock and the gate had

been broken and the Respondent and her family had forcibly entered the said

property. The Appellant's first reaction was to lodge a complaint with the

Police instead of taking the law into her own hands. In this complaint, the

Appellant had stated 'as follows:

"C! e:>C! ~Oe e 6)<:)) C!C5>lIDtm {'fQQrRJ C!e)@) eDC!~ . e)C! ~

e)C!~ er&D &DO@) C) e)C) ~6) .... Q@Q) c!~6) C!@r.OCa."

This is the plea of a person who is desperate to get what she is entitled to and

is seeking the help of law enforcement authorities prior to the possible

escalation of the situation to the use of force and violence which would then

lead to a breach of the peace.

There is no material before this Court whether the Police took any action but

the fact that the Appellant herself invoked the jurisdiction of the Primary

Court, where she stated that a breach of the peace had in fact occurred, is in

the view of this Court sufficient compliance with the requirements of Section

66(1)(b).

The filing of the action in the Primary Court and that too within 10 days of the

incident, is evidence of the fact that at the least, the Appellant feared a breach

1C

of the peace was threatened or likely which necessitated her to take action

under the law and seek redress of Court. In this background, the response of

the Respondent to what had taken place on 29th May 2005 was a mere general

denial. There was no specific averment in the affidavit filed by the Respondent

with regard to the incident that is said to have occurred on 29th May 2005 or

with regard to the averment of the Appellant that a breach of the peace had in

fact taken place. This Court is of the view that if a breach of the peace had not

occurred, then a specific plea to that effect ought to have been set out in the

affidavit of the Respondent as opposed to merely stating that what had

occurred was only a civil dispute.

What is precisely mea'nt by a breach of the peace being threatened or likely

has been considered by our Courts over the years.

In Iqbal vs MajedudeenlO, this Court observed as follows:

((In conclusion, it is to be remarked that it would not be inopportune to

add to what I have said above, in regard to the vexed or much discussed

question: under what circumstances can it be said that a given dispute is

likely to lead to a breach of the peace. A hint or slight indication relative

to that question may be helpful, in that it would offer a directing principle

in regard to the question whether any given dispute or circumstances are

likely to lead to a breach of the peace which expression generally signifies

disorderly, dangerous conduct and acts tending to a violation of public

tranquillity or order. One may safely conclude that if the entry into

possession is done or effected by force or involves force it is, in the nature

10 1999 (3) Sri LR 213 at 218,

1C.

of things, such an entry as is likely to evoke resistance which would

invariably be fraught with the danger that it would be productive of

friction. IIBreach of the peace is likelyll does not mean that the breach of

the peace would ensue for a certainty; rather, it means that a breach of

the peace (or disorder) is a result such as might well happen or occur or is

something that is, so to speak, on the cards."

In Oliver Millious vs M.H.A.Haleemll this Court held as follows:

"Another submission made by Counsel in this case was that the learned

High Court judge failed to consider the preliminary issue that there was an

absence of circumstances to warrant the conclusion that there was a

likelihood of a breach of the peace, when viewed in the light of the fact

that the police had not deemed it fit or necessary to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Primary Court in respect of this matter. It should be

noted here that Section 66 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act makes

provision not only to the police to file information but provision has been

made to any party to such dispute to file an information. Therefore,

failure of the police to file an information in this case does not mean that

there was no likelihood of a breach of the peace. If there is a dispute

affecting land and a breach of the peace is threatened or likely then the

Primary Court will have jurisdiction to inquire into the matter. The Court

has to consider whether the dispute is such that it is likely to cause a

breach of the peace. It is the apprehension of a breach of the peace not

any infringement of a private right or dispossession of any of the parties

which determines the jurisdiction of the Primary Court Judge. It is

11 2001 [BLR] 8.

17

sufficient for a Primary Court Judge to exercise the powers under this

Section if he is satisfied on the material on record that there is a present

fear that there will be a breach of the peace stemming from the dispute

unless proceedings are taken under the Section. Primary Court Judge

should however proceed with great caution where there is no police

report and the only material before him are the statements of interested

perspns. As happened in this case when the hut belonging to the

respondents had been burnt down and the barbed wire fence in their land

had been dismantled, can one say that there was no likelihood of a breach

of the peace?"

It would also be a'ppropriate at this stage for this Court to refer to the

judgment of Salam J, in Wickremasinghe vs Wickremasinghe12 where he

observed as follows:

"Historically, there has always been a great deal of rivalry in the society

stemming from disputes relating to immovable properties, where the

breach of the peace is threatened or likely. In the case of Perera Vs.

Gunathilake (1900 - 4 N.L.R 181) His Lordship Bonser c.J, with an

exceptional foresight, spelt out the rationale well over a century and a

decade ago, underlying the principle as to why a court of law should

discourage all attempts towards the use of force in the maintenance of

the rights of citizens affecting immovable property. To quote His Lordship:

Ifln a country like this, any attempt of parties to use force in the

maintenance of their rights should be promptly discouraged. Slight brawls

12 CA(PHC APN 17/2006; CA Minutes of 30

th September 2011

rapidly blossom into riots with grievous hurt and murder as the fruits. It is

therefore, all the more necessary that Courts should be strict in

discountenancing all attempts to use force in the assertion of such civil

rights."

Taking into consideration the facts of the present case in the light of the

abovementio!'ed judgments, this Court is of the view that there was sufficient

evidence before the learned Primary Court Judge as set out earlier in this

judgement, to assume jurisdiction on the basis that a breach of the peace had

occurred or at the least, threatened or likely which necessitated action by the

learned Primary Court Judge in terms of the Act. Courts should not insist on

actual physical violence as proof of a breach of the peace, but should be

guided by the circumstances of each case and the requirements of section

66(l)(b) itself, which is that a breach of the peace should be threatened or

likely. Therefore, this Court is not in agreement with the findings of the learned

High Court Judge that a breach of the peace was not threatened or likely.
