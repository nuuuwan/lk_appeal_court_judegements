ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

was indicted before the High Court of Kegalle upon an allegation of

committing rape on a 23-year-old woman, Dodawatte Vidanelage Sujani

Priyanganie, on 07.11.2005, an offence punishable under Section 364(1) of

the Penal Code, as amended.

Upon his election to be tried without a jury, the trial commenced

and proceeded the Appellant before the trial Judge who finally convicted

him for the offence of rape and sentenced him to a ten-year term of

imprisonment. He was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000.00 and in default

a three months imprisonment was imposed. In addition, the Appellant

2

was ordered to pay Rs. 100,000.00 as compensation to the Prosecutrix with

a default term of one year of imprisonment. The sentences of

imprisonments were ordered to run consecutively by the trial Court.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant

sought to challenge its validity on the basis that the trial Court had failed

to evaluate the evidence placed before it properly and thereby reaching an

erroneous conclusion as to his guilt. This ground of appeal was founded

on the evidence in relation to the injuries that were noted on the genitalia

of the Prosecutrix. The Appellant contends that medical evidence does not

support an hour-long sexual act, as she claims to have taken place. It is

also contended by the Appellant that the medical evidence does not

support her claim of penetration and the civil action initiated by the

Prosecutrix claiming damages was decided in his favour by the Civil

Appellate High Court.

The evidence presented by the prosecution through Priyanganie

revealed that she used to leave home at about 5.45 a.m. to work and had to

traverse through a lonely pathway passing Ketawala Handiya to reach the

main road to catch the 6.15 bus. On 7th November 2007, she was on her

way to work and the Appellant, who is a fellow villager and therefore a

well-known person, has dragged her near the stream and had sexually

penetrated her. Although she raised cries, there were no houses in the

vicinity. After the act of sexual aggression, the Appellant had threatened

her to go to work.

3

However, the Prosecutrix had reached the closest house and told

Premalatha of the incident. Premalatha, in her evidence stated that the

prosecutrix complained that the Appellant /I 0)6~6 0)6~~ (S)lbO" after

dragging her away. She also noted that Priyanganie was crying and was

carrying her foot ware in her hand with dishevelled hair. Premalatha did

not press the Prosecutrix for details of the incident and comforted her with

a cup of tea. She was thereafter sent home in the company of her younger

sister who happens to pass that way. Premalatha's husband stated that

Priyanganie called out his name at about 6.00 a.m. when they were in their

sleep and when ventured out to enquire, have seen the Prosecutrix who

thereafter said something to his wife.

The Prosecutrix had, upon reaching her home at about 10.00 a.m.,

told her mother of the incident. She has told her mother that 1/ 6~c5~ ~O)C)

olC)ci 0)6)" initially and then added that she was raped by the Appellant.

After hearing her daughter's complaint of rape, she had taken a knife to

attack the Appellant.

Yatiyantota Police station received the 1st information about this

incident from the Prosecutrix who was accompanied to it by her mother at

1.50 p.m. on 07.11.2005. Thereafter, she was produced before the Judicial

Medical Officer for examination. The investigators, upon scene inspection

have observed that the incident had taken place on a bank of a stream that

runs along a foot path that leads to a stony pathway, which connects with

the main road at the distance of about one kilometre from the place of the

4

incident. There were no houses noted by the Police in the vicinity of the

place pointed out by the Prosecutrix.

Medical examination of the genitalia of the Prosecutrix by the

Consultant JMO on 08.11.2005 revealed that she has a fimbriated hymen.

She also had fresh laceration on her left labia minora and another

laceration around it. No spermatozoa were identified in the specimen

taken from her genitalia. The medical expert was of the opinion that the

pressing of a penis on the labia minora against the underlying pelvic bone

could have resulted in the injuries that were observed on the Prosecutrix

and it supports vaginal penetration, but not beyond the hymen.

The Appellant, during his cross examination, has suggested to the

Prosecutrix that she had tried to start an affair with him and since he did

not show any interest in her, this allegation was foisted on him. He

reiterated this position in his short statement from the dock.

In its judgment, the trial Court had considered the evidence of the

prosecution and of the Appellant. The trial Court was of the view that the

evidence of the Prosecutrix is of such a character that convinced it that she

speaks the truth, and therefore it need not be corroborated. The trial Court

quoted the judgment of Sumanadasa v Republic of Sri Lanka CA 147 of

2005 in support of its decision. It had meticulously considered the evidence

to decide whether the vital element of penetration has been proved by the

5

prosecution on this evidence, in the light of the judgments of CA No.

88/2002, CA No. 299/2008 and CA No. 138/2003, where it has been

collectively held that to constitute the offence of rape; the minimal degree

of penetration should be by placing and pressing a penis between labia. To

prove penetration no penile erection is necessary and negative evidence of

penetration does not exclude rape. The trial Court then concluded that the

prosecution did prove all element of the offence of rape, including that of

penetration, beyond reasonable doubt.

The trial Court, having had the distinct advantage of observing the

Prosecutrix at the witness box and considering her evidence applying the

tests of spontaneity, consistency and probability arrived at the conclusion

that her evidence is both truthful and reliable. The trial Court had

considered the inconsistencies that had been marked off her evidence as

V1 and V2 in relation to the mud patches on her dress and the condition of

her hair and correctly decided that those refers to insignificant details and

therefore had no bearing as to her testimonial trustworthiness. It was

mindful of the fact that she was giving evidence after 10 years since the

incident.

The complaint by the Appellant that her claim of sexual penetration

that lasted about an hour is an improbable one when considered in the

light of the medical evidence should be considered in the light of the

available evidence.

6

..

The mere reference to an hour in answer to the question about the

duration of the act of insertion of penis by the Prosecutrix gave rise to this

complaint by the Appellant. The Consultant JMO has noted signs of

depression when he examined the Prosecutrix in the following morning.

This claim by the Prosecutrix could be understood considering the helpless

situation she was in and time durations in those circumstances could not

be relied upon as accurate estimations. Her fear, pain, helplessness and

desperate struggle to get away from the Appellant's act of sexual

aggression could certainly have obscured her ability for proper estimation

of time. We are of the view that this factor alone is not sufficient to taint

her evidence as an unreliable account of events and therefore this

particular fact certainly does not justify an inference that she is not telling

the truth.

In determining the effect of the evidence placed before it by the

Appellant the trial Court had observed that it did not raise a reasonable

doubt about the prosecution. Judging by the probabilities as to the claim of

the Appellant in an Asian cultural setting, as highlighted by the judgment

of Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat (1983) AIR SC 753, we concur with the

view held by the trial Court in rejecting his evidence.

In the circumstances, we hold that there is no merit in the appeal of

the Appellant and therefore his appeal ought to be dismissed.

7

..

We affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial

Court as it is appropriate in the circumstances and legal. The appeal of the

Appellant is accordingly dismissed.
