ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal lodged against an order made by the Provincial

High Court of the Western Province holden in Gampaha by which the

revision application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the" Appellant") was dismissed.

2

In instituting action before the Magistrate's Court of Mahara, the

Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent") under Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority

Act of 41 of 1978 as amended, upon her failure to comply with the

directions issued and served on the Appellant, sought an order of

demolition of the unauthorised construction carried out by her.

The Magistrate's Court has authorised the demolition of the said

unauthorised structure since the Appellant had failed to satisfy the Court

I that she had a valid permit to affect such development activity in spite of

the several opportunities that were made available to her.

She had then unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the said order

before the Provincial High Court.

At the hearing of the instant appeal, learned Counsel for the

Respondent raised preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the

appeal of the Appellant on the following basis:-

a. The Appellant has not named the Chairman of the Mahara

Pradeshiya Sabha a party to the action,

b. The Appellant has incorrectly made her appearance through a

registered Attorney as "Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant"

whereas she should be "Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant",

3

c. Prayer of her petition of appeal is incomplete/ incorrect since the

Appellant only sought to set aside the order of the Provincial

High Court and not the order of demolition by the Magistrate's

Court.

The parties invited this Court to pronounce its order on the

preliminary objections upon written submissions.

In relation to th~ first preliminary objection, the Respondent

contended that the Appellant has named "Chairman, Mahara Urban

Council" whereas the Respondent is in fact "Chairman, Mahara Pradesheeya

Sabha". In reply, the Appellant submitted that the reference to "Chairman,

Mahara Urban Council" is a mistake made inadvertently and the

Respondent is not "materially prejudiced" with the said error in the

caption. It is further submitted that the Appellant had correctly named the

"Chairman, Mahara Pradesheeya Sabha" in her revision application before

the Provincial High Court and relied on the dicta of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in SC Appeal No. 50 of.2008 - decided on 29.06.2011.

The second preliminary objection raised by the Respondent is based

on the description of the Appellant as "Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant"

in her proxy whereas she should have described her as the "Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant". The Appellant sought counter this objection on the

basis that the defective proxy filed by her describing her as "Petitioner-

4

Respondent-Appellant" is a curable defect as the judicial precedents

reveal.

These two preliminary objections refer to procedural defects the

appeal of the Appellant suffers. No doubt the Respondent is entitled to

raise them and challenge the validity of the appeal of the Appellant

although these objections referred to be treated as of purely technical in

nature.

This Court, nonetheless, must consider the nature of the defect and

the importance that should be attached to it in view of the prejudice such

defect could cause to any other party to that appeal.

The judgement of the Supreme Court in Elias v. Gajasinghe S.c.

Appeal No. 50/2008 - decided on 28-06-2011refers to a matter where the

dispute was whether the first power of attorney was adequate to file action

against both defendants or whether the second power of attorney could

cover up what was not there in the first power of attorney.

Their Lordships concluded that the said objection is;

II llig171y tecllllicnl matter which has delayed the

dispensntion of jllstice in this case regarding a matter which

needed quick disposnl. For the proper dispensation of justice,

raising of technicnl objections should be discouraged and

parties sho1l1rf be encollrnged to seek justice by dealing with

the merits of cnses. Rnising of such technical objections and

5

dealing with them and the subsequent challenges on them to

the superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to the

delay and the backlog of cases pending in Courts. Very often

the dealing of such technicalities become only an academic

exercise with which the litigants would not be interested.

The delay in dispensation of justice can be minimized if

parties are discouraged from taking up technical objections

which takes up valuable judicial time. What is important for

litigants would be their aspiration to get justice from courts

on merits rather than on technicalities. As has often been

.i quoted it must be remembered that Courts of law are Courts

of justice and not academies of law."

In the light of the above observation, we hold that these two

objections could not be taken as the ones upon which the Appellant should

be denied of her right access to justice.

The third preliminary objection is in relation to reliefs prayed in the

petition of appeal. In raising his objection, the Respondent contended that

the Appellant only sought to set aside the order of the Provincial High

Court and without a specific prayer to set aside the order of demolition

made by the Magistrate's Court and therefore the prayer to the petition of

appeal of the Appellant is incomplete/ incorrect.

In meeting this contention, the Appellant replied that when she

prayed for allowing of her revision application as a relief from this Court,

6

the remedy against the order of demolition is automatically covered and

therefore the objections are liable to be overruled.

Perusal of the petition addressed to the Provincial High Court

reveals that the Appellant has sought multiple reliefs from it including

interim, declaratory and in the form of final relief, setting aside the order

made by the Magistrate's Court. In these circumstances, this Court

reluctantly accepts the Appellant's submissions that she has prayed for the

setting aside of the order of the Magistrate's Court.

Clearly the draftsman of the petition of appeal had no clear

I comprehension of the reliefs that should be sought from this Court and as

a result, in view of the objection raised by the Respondent, the Appellant

now had to rely on a obscure prayer to make up for the deficiency. It is

unfortunate to note that the Appellant's main contention before the

Provincial High Court is also that her claim was not adequately placed

before the Court below and she remits the cause of that lapse on her legal

representative.

However, having considered the submissions of the parties for and

against the preliminary objections, we are of the view that they are of very

technical nature and are curable without causing any prejudice to the

Respondent.

It is appropriate at this juncture to refer to the following dicta of

Amerasinghe J in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and Others (1997) 3 Sri L.R.1

7

.~.=======================================================================tl

"Judges, do not blindly devote themselves to procedures or

ruthlessly sacrifice litigants to technicalities, although

parties on the road to justice may choose to act recklessly. On

the contrary, as the indispensable vehicle for the attainment

of justice, civil procedural law has a protective character. In

its protective character, civil procedural law represents the

orderly, regular and public functioning of the legal

machinery and the operation of the due process of law. "

In the circumstances, we are of the view that the three preliminary

objections raised by the Respondent should be overruled and thereafter

proceed to fix this appeal for hearing on its merits.

Preliminary objections are overruled.
