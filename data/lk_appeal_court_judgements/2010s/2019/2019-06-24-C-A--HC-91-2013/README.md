ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal by the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the "1st and 2nd appellants" respectively) against their

conviction for multiple counts of murder and the consequent imposition of

penalty of death.

The indictment that had been presented to the High Court of

Kurunegala contained 152 counts including 40 counts of murder, 36 counts

of attempted murder against the 1st appellant while it is alleged that the 2nd

appellant aided and abetted the 1st appellant to commit said offences. At

the conclusion of the trial, the 1st appellant was found guilty to 33 counts

of murder and 27 counts of attempted murder. The 2nd appellant was

2

. .

. ,

found guilty to 33 counts of abetment to murder and 27 counts of abetment

to attempted murder.

Prosecution case is that the 1st appellant; being the driver of the bus

bearing registration number NWHT 2520, packed with passengers to its

capacity, was on its way to Colombo. Upon reaching the Yangalmodera level

crossing, on A6 highway the 1st appellant made an attempt to drive around

the closed rail gate of the level crossing with its red light burning in spite

of the fact that onlookers have warned him of the oncoming Colombo-Kandy

intercity express train. The train collided with the passenger bus at the

middle of its body while it was sitting right on the rail track, resulting in

extensive damage to the passengers and the vehicle which was then

further damaged due to the fire that erupted immediately after the said

collision. The incident left 40 persons dead and at least 27 persons

seriously injured. The 2nd appellant was the conductor of the bus and it is

alleged that when the gate of the level crossing was closed he had

positioned himself on the rail track, acted as a lookout and beckoned the 1 st

appellant to drive through the opening left on the wrong side of the road

on to the rail track.

Learned Counsel for the appellants, having made submissions in

support of the appeal of the appellants, contended that the appellants

could not have entertained a "murderous intent" in the teeth of the

evidence on record and cited several portions of evidence led by the

prosecution, which are reproduced below, in support of the said

contention.

3

,

a. the vehicle had been halted behind 2-3 vehicles which had

stopped at a railway crossing as half gates had been

lowered and red light burning

b. there had been a '5' bend along the rail track at the

approach to the crossing, therefore an approaching train

could not be seen at a distance

c. the second appellant had alighted from the vehicle gone up

to and examined the crossing and beckoned the first

appellant to bring the vehicle to cross the track

d. when the vehicle had crossed the track halfway, suddenly

the train had appeared and crashed into it resulting in the

deaths and injuries to passengers

e. the first appellant was also seriously injured and struck in

the driving seat. He was pulled out and hospitalised for a

long period. The second appellant who had got into the

bus just before it crossed was also seriously injured and

hospitalised

f. there is no evidence that the appellants in fact had seen the

train approaching

g. there is no evidence that the appellants attempted to jump

out and flee from the bus in view of the inevitable collision

of the train and bus

h. independent witness Wimalaranga and the gate keeper

Jayaratne testified that the first appellant had halted the bus

at the gate and proceeded forward once given' all clear'

4

signal by the second appellant which was obviously done

as there was no train in sight.

In these circumstances, it was submitted by the learned Counsel for

the appellants that the evidence presented by the prosecution clearly

points to an error of judgment on the 1st appellant which resulted in the

commission of a rash and negligent act which could have been made

culpable under Section 298 of the Penal Code and therefore the appellants

would have been found guilty to that offence.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in supporting the conviction of

the appellants, contended that the conduct of the appellants had" shown

nothing but complete disregard for human life and safety of his passengers

to whom he had an utmost responsibility to provide with safe

transportation" and therefore moved this Court to affirm the convictions

entered against them by the High Court of Kurunegala. He cited an

extensive list of judicial precedents and texts which dealt with the

"knowledge" referred to in the Fourth Limb Section of 294 of the Penal

Code.

Since the learned Counsel for the appellants argued that the 1st

appellant had no murderous intention in his mind when he drove the

passenger bus on to the rail track, this contention must be examined in the

context of the applicable law and the relevant judicial precedents.

The case for the prosecution was presented not on the basis that the

1st appellant had driven the ill-fated passenger bus onto the rail track with

intention to cause death of a particular individual or some individuals or

that he intended to cause bodily injury which is likely to cause death to

5

. .

such individuals. Similarly, the evidence does not reveal that he intended

to cause bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary cour~~ o( !la.ture

. r. . ,", to cause death to a particular individual or individuals. The first three

limbs of Section 294 of the Penal Code which are based on "intention" and

therefore has no application to the instant appeal.

It is clear that the prosecution had relied on the Fourth Limb of

Section 294 of the Ceylon Penal Code, when it alleged that the 15t appellant

committed murder when he drove.a bus, with passengers through a level.

crossing when there were clear warnings of the arrival of the train.

Fourth Limb of Section 294 is as follows;

"If the person committing the act knows that it is so

imminently dangerous that it must in all probability

cause death, or such bodily injury as it likely to cause

death, and commits such act without any excuse for

incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as

aforesaid. "

Dr. Gour, in his treatise of The Indian Penal Code (13th Edition, at

p.979) states that;

"The clause "fourthly" comprehends generally the

commission of imminently dangerous acts which must

in all probability cause death or cause such bodily

injury as is likely to cause death. When such an act is

committed with the knowledge that death might be

probable result and without any excuse for incurring 6

the risk of causing death or injury as is likely to cause

death, the offence is murder. This clause, speaking

generally, covers cases in which there is. no intention

to cause death of anyone in particular. "

In the said limb, there is no mention of any "intention". Instead, it

speaks about knowledge. That knowledge' must be about the act of the

offender which is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability

cause death, or such bodily injury as it likely to cause death. The requisite

knowledge, in relation to the Fourth Limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code,

has already received judicial attention.

In Somapala v The Queen 72 N.L.R. 121 the Court of Criminal

Appeal, having noted that the knowledge that envisaged in the Fourth

Limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code is

" knowledge, that an act lS so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, is

knowledge, not merely of the likelihood of causing

death, but of high probability of causing death or

injury likely to cause death"

and stated further that;

" .. , it is thus appears while the act of causing death

with knowledge that the act is likely to cause death is

culpable homicide, such act is not murder, unless

either -7

a. the offender intends to cause bodily injury and

has the special knowledge that the intended

injury is likely to cause death of the person

injl1red, or

b. the offender knows that, because the act so

imminently dangerous, there is the high

probability of causing death or an injury likely

to cause death. /I

In King v Wjeratnam 43 N.L.R. 25, the Court of Criminal Appeal

cited Plowden J in Barkatulla (1887)(P.R. no. 32 of 1887) where it was

stated that II An act done with knowledge alone is not prima facie murder ... it

becomes an act of murder only if it can be positively affirmed that there was no

excuse ... it must be a 'wholly inexcusable act of extreme recklessness'. /I This

view was adopted in Bandara v Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri L.R. I,

Farook v Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 174 and Chandrasena v

Attorney General (2008) 2 Sri L.R. 255.

In Jinadasa v Attorney General (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 234, a divisional

bench of this Court held that;

" ... to prove that the accused is guilty of murder under

the fourth limb the prosecution must prove beyond

reasonable doubt that the person committing the act

knew that it was so imminently dangerous that;

1. it must in all probability cause death or

2. in all probability cause such bodily injury as

is likely to cause death and that the accused

8

committed such act without any excuse for

incurring the risk of causing of such injury

as aforesaid."

In pronouncing the judgment of The King v Rengasamy 25 N.L.R.

438, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the different connotations of

the terms "intention" and "knowledge." It is stated that;

"Intention is a conscious and voluntary act of the

mind. It consists in desiring a particular result and in

formulating to oneself the physical means by which

that result is to be achieved. The mental decision and

the physical act may be momentary, but the above

factors must be present. Knowledge, on the other hand,

is a mere passive condition of the mind. It mayor may

not be consciously present in the mind at the moment

the act is done. Intention involves knowledge, and is

frequently inferred from it. In cases where knowledge

of the nature of the act and its consequences are

sufficient ... for example in the cases contemplated in

the fourth paragraph of Section 294 of the Penal Code,

such knowledge is sufficient to constitute murder. This

paragraph does not apply to all cases of homicide. It

relates only to cases of extreme rashness and disregard

to human life. Illustration (d) under this section shows

what was intended by the framers of the Code. This is

the only class of cases in which a man may be guilty of

9

murder, even though he might not have intended the

death of his victim. In all other cases intention is an

essential requisite of murder under our Code. Where

knowledge is impu ted to the accused as a legal fiction,

intention should not be argued from it".

The learned High Court Judge was mindful of the applicable law in

relation to the multiple counts of murder the 1st appellant was charged

with. He had correctly investigated whether the 1st accused had the

requisite knowledge and not the intention as argued by the appellant. In

coming to the finding that it is the Fourth Limb of Section 294 of the Penal

Code that applies to the case before him, learned High Court Judge had

considered the applicability of other three limbs of the said section. Having

determined the applicability of the Fourth Limb to the evidence led by the

prosecution before him, learned High Court judge had then considered the

question of the nature of the required knowledge in relation to the Fourth

Limb of the said section. He had then correctly applied the principle of law

enunciated in Somapala v The Queen (supra).

In determining the issue whether the 1st appellant had the requisite

knowledge or not, the prosecution relied on the evidence of the conduct

that had been attributed to him. There was truthful and reliable evidence

presented before the trial Court that the 1st appellant had, upon noting the

rail gate was closed and a line of vehicles is already waiting for rail gate to

open after the train passes the crossing, directed the 2nd appellant to walk

10

onto the rail track and to act as a lookout. This is a clear indication as to the

state of mind of the 1st appellant. He was fully aware of the imminent

danger that is involved with his intended act of driving acrQss the railway

crossing, when a train is about to pass through, and should there be a

collision with the train, then;

a. it must in all probability cause death of one or more of his

passengers or

b. in all probability cause such bodily injury as is likely to

cause death to them.

The 1st appellant, during his evidence admitted that he knew the

imminent danger that was involved with his act of driving across the

railway when a train is about to pass and also that death would ensue if

there is collision with the locomotive. On this issue, Dr. Gour, states at p.

982 that;

"The question is whether an act is imminently

dangerous depends upon the nature of the act and its

evident risk to human life. The word "imminently"

implies a risk which is both threatening and near."

Prosecution presented evidence through the Railway Guard, the

Operator of the automatic rail gate at Yangalmodera level crossing, the

Engine Driver of the Intercity Express train as to the details in relation to

11

the signalling process, the timing and the distances that are involved and

how the rail gate operates.

It is stated in evidence that the rail gate of Yangalmodera level

crossing would starts to close when the Kandy bound train passes the

"point" near Walakumbura Railway Station, located 700 yards from the said

level crossing. The rail gate mechanism was serviced two days prior and

was perfect in working order. As the train passes Walakumbura, the signal

light on the main road burn in yellow colour alerting the motorists of the

imminent arrival of the train. The alarm bell at the level crossing starts to

ring and the rail gate closes automatically. The train is then given green

light signal to proceed along across the level crossing. There is a'S' bend in

the approach to the level crossing and as the train took the first of the

double bend, the Engine Driver saw the ill-fated passenger bus on the

middle of his track. Then the Engine of the train had rammed onto the

passenger bus and continued to move some 200 yards since its braking

mechanism was damaged due to the collision with the passenger bus. The

train was travelling at the speed of 40 - 45 miles per hour and would reach

the level crossing about 7 seconds from the "point" in Walakumbura.

This evidence indicates the imminent nature of the danger that is

involved with the act of the 1st appellant. When the 1st appellant arrived at

the level crossing, the rail gate was already closed and there were few

vehicles already waiting in line. The closed rail gate indic.ated that the train

has passed Walakumbura "point" and on its way. The estimated seven

12

seconds window of opportunity that existed between the closing of the

gate and arrival of the train had already started its count down and is

narrowing. Then the 1 st accused took his bus through the other lane of the

highway to reach the level crossing. He then sent the 2nd appellant to act as

lookout. The 2nd appellant cannot see beyond the bend but signals the 1st

appellant to drive on, who then squeezes his bus through the gap between

the rail gate and opposite lane, on to the rail track. Each of these individual

actions of the appellants consume the remaining crucial seconds that are

left for the train to arrive at the level crossing. And the train arrives

resulting in the collision.

The signal lights showed red and alarm bells were ringing, when the

1 st appellant took the bus on the track . The 1st appellant drove his bus

through the gap right on to the rail track when the gate operator, a

lineman of the Railway Department and a three wheeler driver were

shouting at him that the train is arriving. These factors clearly satisfy that

the act of driving a loaded passenger bus onto the rail track by the 1st

appellant when a train is about to arrive is an act of imminent danger and

of the 2nd appellant in abetting the 1 st appellant.

It is noted that the wording of Fourth Limb of Section 294 indicates

another requirement that the prosecution must establish. That requirement

is that the 1st appellant committed the culpable act "without any excuse".

The 1st appellant had sought to provide an excuse for committing the

imminently dangerous act. He claimed that the passengers are office

13

workers and he would generally reach Colombo at a particular time ~o~,that

they could reach their offices in time and he took this risk with a view to

reach his destination in time keeping to his reputation.

Whether this is a valid excuse or not must be considered in the light

of judicial applicable precedents.

In The King v Rengasamy (supra) Bertram C.}. stated that;

liThe words 'without any excuse' are intended to

except such cases, as where a military officer lawfully

fires upon a mob, or where the captain of a vessel takes

the risks contemplated in Section 74. In my opinion

juries should be told that this enactment should be

confined to that class of cases, and that in ordinary

cases it should be left out of consideration."

Thus, it is clear that the 1st appellant had no valid excuse and had

knowingly committed his act which is clearly imminently dangerous and

in all probability cause death of one or more of his passengers or such

bodily injury as is likely to cause death. The 2nd appellant had clearly

aided and abetted the 1st appellant.

In view the consideration contained in the preceding paragraphs, we

are of the firm opinion that the appeal of the appellants is without any

merit and ought to be dismissed on that account.

14

.. ,

Therefore, the convictions that had been entered upon the appellants

and the sentences that are imposed on them are hereby affirmed by this

Court.

The appeal of the appellants is accordingly dismissed.
