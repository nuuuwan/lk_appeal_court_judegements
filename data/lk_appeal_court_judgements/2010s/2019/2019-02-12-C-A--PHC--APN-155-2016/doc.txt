The 3rd Respondent-Petitioner has filed this reViSiOn application seeking to set

aside the order of the Learned High Cqurt Judge of Provincial High Court of the

Central Province holden in Kandy dated~02.11.2016in Case No. Writ 50/2015.

Facts of the case:

The petitioner-respondent (hereinafter 'referred to as the 'petitioner-respondent')

was holding the post of Chairman of the Regional Committee representative to the

General Assembly and the post of Dire;tor of Matale Multi-Purpose Cooperative

Society Ltd. The 3rd respondent-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

I 'petitioner') informed the petitioner- resf ondent by the letter dated 02.05.2014 t'1at

the Board of Directors of the cooperative society at its meeting held on 26.04.2014

had decided to temporarily remove the petitioner- respondent from the aforesaid , posts. It was further informed that the petitioner- respondent had obtained

membership contrary to Section 7(2) of the by-laws. Thereafter the petitioner-

) respondent tendered his explanation to the Board of Directors. But, the Board of

Directors at its meeting held on 21 1.05.2014 rejected the said explanation.

! Therefore the petitioner- respondent requested the 1

5t respondent-respondeJit

(hereinafter referred to as the '1 5t respondent- respondent') to set aside the sai-d

decision of the Board of Directors dated 2l.05.2014. The 2nd respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as th~ '2nd respondent') thereafter informed the

petitioner that the removal of the petition~r- respondent from the posts he held was

illegal and contrary to law (Page 138 and 139 of brief). Thereafter, by the letter

dated 0l.09.2015 (PIO) the 2nd respondent (Assistant Commissioner) informed the

secretary of the regional society to convene a General Assembly of the regional

society for the purpose of taking a decisibn.

'j

However the Learned Counsel for th~ petitioner contended that a General

Assembly meeting of the Regional Society has been called on 20.09.2015 in

contravention of the provisions of the by-1aws, without publishing a public notice.

Further, a venue far away from the limits af the regional society had been selected

for the said meeting. Thereafter some ~members of the regional society have

complained to the 1 st respondent-responq~nt to cancel the said meeting scheduled

to be held and requested to hold a meeting' within the limits of the Regional Society

Ii giving a public notice. (DO 1 at page 156 0 / the brief) Thereafter, the 2nd respondent

directed the secretary of the regional society not to hold the said General Assembly

meeting as it has been called in contravention of the by-laws (the letter marked as

, 003 at the page 159 of the brief). Neverth~less the Regional Society held a meeting

and approved the membership of the pytitioner- respondent. Thereafter the 1 st

respondent-respondent made a decision , '-' rder section 60(2) of the Cooperative

Societies Statute of the Central Provincial 'Council, No.1 0 of 1990 holding that the

petitioner- respondent could be recruited as a new member (Page 171 of the brief).

Subsequently, the petitioner- respondent f~ led an application in the Provincial High

4 Court of the Central Province holden if! Kandy seeking a writ of Mandamus

directing the petitioner and the 1 sl and 2nd respondents-respondents to reinstate the

petitioner- respondent in the offices and P()sts he held in the Cooperative Society.

The Learned High Court Judge, by the judgment dated 02.11.2016, granted a writ

of Mandamus reinstating the petitioner- r~:spondent in the office and posts he held.

Being aggrieved by the said decision the petitioner preferred a revision application

\ to this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner- r~spondent contended that the petitioner,

without exercising his right of appeal, has preferred this revision application and

Page 5 of 7

the petitioner has not furnished any exceptional circumstances as to why he opted

I not to exercise his constitutional rights.)

, The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that after instituting liS

i application, the petitioner also lodged a hotice of appeal seeking to appeal aga 1St

the said judgment. However, since t~' s Court issued notice in this revi ~ In

, application and was possessed of the maher, the petitioner did not file a petitio] of

appeal in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation.

!i

.\ The Learned Counsel for the petition',: r contended that the judgment of the

~ Provincial High Court is ex facie wrong for the following reasons and therefore the ,

r petitioner is entitled to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction even though a right of

appeal exists from the said judgment;

"

i) The Provincial High Court, failed to appreciate that the petitioner-

respondent had not challen&ed the decision made under section 60(2)

of the Cooperative Societies ,Statute of the central Provincial Council,

\ . No. 10 of 1990, which is a final decision.

'I ii) The provincial High Court h s not given reasons for its judgment.

We observe that in terms of section 60(2) of the Cooperative Societies Statute, the

; commissioner is empowered to take a d~~ision in respect of a dispute pertaining tQ

f the election of an office bearer or the validity of the membership of a member and

such a decision is final.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that petitioner- respondent

instituted the writ application subsequent to the decision of the commissione~

under section 60(2) but did not seek to., challenge the said decision made und"'i

I section 60(2) of the Cooperative Societies statute of the Central Provincial CounCil

1 No. 10 of 1990. The petitioner- respond nt instituted the writ application directly

I

,

~ .

seeking only a writ of Mandamus while the said decision made under section 60(2) ,

I remaining operati ve and final.

Accordingly we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge erred in issuing

a writ of Mandamus as prayed for by the ~etitioner- respondent in the absence of a

prayer by the petitioner- respondent to quash the decision dated 15.12.2015 made

I by the Commissioner of Cooperative Development and Registrar of Cooperative

Societies. Therefore we set aside the orer of the Learned High Court Judge of

Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy dated 02.11.2016

I in Case No. Writ 50/2015.

.: Accordingly the revision application is allowed.
