Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

This application was taken up for argument on 4th July 2018 1 together with CA

(Writ) Application No. 197/2012. The learned Counsel appearing for all parties

moved that this Court pronounce its judgment in CA (Writ) 197/2012 on the

written submissions that would be tendered by the parties in that application and

that the parties in this application would be bound by the judgment that would be

delivered by this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 197/2012. Thereafter, when

this matter came up for judgment on t h December 2018 together with CA (Writ)

Application No. 197/2012 1 this Court requested the parties to provide clarification

on two matters arising in CA (Writ) Application No. 197/2012 1 which was duly

provided on 29th January 2019. Having considered the material in each case and

the written submissions filed in the said application, this Court is of the view that

a separate judgment should be delivered in this application, even though some of

the parties in the two applications are identical and the facts are connected in

most respects, for the reason that this application involves the interpretation of

Sections 34 and 36 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 20001 as amended.

The Petitioner states that he is a co-owner of the land called 'Udakumbura'

situated in Halpawala, Panawenna in the District of Ratnapura. The Petitioner

claims that he is entitled to an undivided 1/3rd share of the said land together

with 29/240 shares of gem mining rights in the said land. Although the Petitioner

has not expressly stated that the said land is a paddy land, there is no dispute

between the parties that the land in question is a paddy land and that the

3

provisions of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, as amended (the Act)

applies to the said land.

The Petitioner states that in February 2012, he found out that the 5th Respondent

had commenced gem mining on the said land. He states that upon further inquiry,

he was informed thar tn-e l -sl Respondent, the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development had granted approval in terms of Sections 34 and 36 of the Agrarian

Development Act permitting gem mining to be carried out on 20 perches of the

said land.1

The Petitioner had initially complained to the 4th Respondent, the National Gem

and Jewellery Authority that its decision to grant the 5th Respondent a gemming

license is bad in law, as the 5th Respondent was only a lessee and did not own any

part of the land in respect of which the gemming license had been issued. The

fact that the only claim that the 5th Respondent has to the said land is a lease

agreement that the 5th Respondent has entered into with persons who claim to

co-own the said land is borne out by the application submitted by the 5th

Respondent for a gemming license in November 2010.2 The only 'deed' that the

5th Respondent had annexed to his application was a 'deed' bearing No. 26959

dated 2

nd November 2010 which is in fact only a lease agreement. 3

The argument of the Petitioner that the 5th Respondent does not have any

ownership to the said land and therefore is not entitled to be issued a gemming

1 The approval granted by the l 't Respondent has been produced by the 4th Respondent, marked '4R9'.

2 A copy of the said application has been submitted by the 4th Respondent marked '4R7A'.

3 A copy of the lease agreement has been produced by the 2

nd Respondent, marked '2RSb'.

4

license was considered by this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 197/2012, where

it was held as follows:

"Issuing of licences to carry out mining for gems (gemming licenses) is

governed by the State Gem Corporation By-laws No.1 of 1971, made by the

State Gem Corporation under Section 21(1) of the State Gem Corporation

Act No. 13 of 1971. The said by-laws, which have been published in the

Ceylon Government Gazette No. 14989/8 dated 23rd December 1971, have

been annexed to the petition marked 'P3'. It is admitted between the parties

that the said by-laws are valid and followed by the National Gem and

Jewellery Authority when issuing gemming licenses. This Court has examined

'P3' and observes that detailed provisions setting out the procedure that

should be followed when issuing licenses are contained in by-laws 2 - 10

thereof.

By-law No. 8(2) of 'P3' is relevant to the issue before this Court and reads as

follows:

"No license shall be granted to any person, unless -

(a) he himself owns the land; or

(b) he has obtained the consent of so many of the other owners as to

ensure that the applicant and such other consenting owners together

5

own at least two thirds of the land in respect of which the application

has been made./I

The effect of by-law No.8 (2) in 'P3' is that the applicant for a gemming

license must either own the land in its entirety or in the case of co-owned

land, tt1e applicant must be a co-owner himself and obtain the consent of

those persons who co-own the land so that the applicant together with the

consenting co-owners will own at least two thirds of the land on which the

gemming is to take place. The by-laws 'P3' clearly does not provide for a

license to be issued to a person who is not an owner but only a lessee./I

Accordingly, this Court had issued a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 4th

Respondent from issuing the 5th Respondent a gemming license in respect of the

land pertaining to this application, unless and until the 5th Respondent satisfied

the ownership criteria laid down in the by-laws referred to in the said judgment.

The Petitioner, having complained to the 4th Respondent, had also complained to

the 1st - 3rd Respondents. What followed was a series of complaints and counter

complaints and inquiries, which culminated in the 1st Respondent issuing the

letter dated 21st June 2013 annexed to the petition marked 'P31' which reads as

follows:

As already held by this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 197/2012, and as borne

out by '4R7 A' itself, the above position is factually wrong. This Court observes

that 'P31' is based on a letter dated 2nd April 2013 marked '4R32' sent by the

Regional Manager (Ratnapura) of the 4th Respondent to the 3rd Respondent and

that the 1st Respondent, clearly influenced by the decision of the 4th Respondent

and its officials that the 5th Respondent is a co-owner of the land in question,

essentially re-produced the contents of '4R32' in 'P31'.

'P31' was followed by another letter sent by the 1st Respondent annexed to the

petition marked 'P34',5 by which the 1st Respondent restored the approval

previously granted, once again on the strength of the finding of the 4 th

Respondent that the 5th Respondent owns 2/3 of the said land.

4 The 5th Respon dent. s 'P34' is dated lih July 2013 and has been issued by the 2nd Respondent to the District Manager C!f the 4th

Res pondent, the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and reads as follows: "@aJ~eeD ooOdc:leD @Cl) (!)(::aci

eeOO)~es5 S?d~CS)", Cf~ 8 , ~, (G ,M) CfoCl) 475 ~ott:J Ql@o~ ~cSo)@aJeD "')@ 8@Q)(;,~ @l<3cs5 ~olc:ltll~

@eDJ@GCD 00 Cl)OGrtn~ ~~) 8 8$,"

7

The Petitioner thereafter filed this application, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the recommendation of the 1st Respondent as

reflected in 'P31' and 'P34';

b) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent from making any orders

under Section 36 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, as

amended.

The basis on which the Petitioner is seeking the said Writs of Certiorari is that the

1st Respondent did not give him a hearing, a claim which has been denied by the

1st - 3rd Respondents, and on the basis that the 5th Respondent is not entitled to

be issued a gemming license as he is not the owner of the land.

There are two sections of the Agrarian Development Act which are relevant when

deciding this application. The first is Section 34 (1) of the Act which provides as

follows:

"No person shall use an extent of paddy land for any purpose other than for

agricultural cultivation except with the written permission of the

Commissioner-General."

The next is Section 36 (1) of the Act, which reads as follows:

8

"Where the tenant cultivator of any extent of paddy land refuses to give his

consent to the owner of such extent of paddy land to extract any mineral

resources from that extent of paddy land, the Commissioner-General may

permit the owner of such extent of paddy land to use an extent not

exceeding twenty perches of that extent of paddy land for the purpose of

extracting such mineral resources during a specified period of time. The

permission granted under this section is permission granted for the use of

such extent of paddy land and shall not be construed as a license permitting

the extraction of such mineral resources."

Thus, it is clear that an owner of a paddy land who wishes to extract minerals

from a paddy land must, in addition to approval under Sections 34 and 36 of the

Act, obtain a gemming license from the 4th Respondent.

One of the important elements in Section 36(1) of the Act is that it must be the

owner who should seek permission from the 1st Respondent to extract minerals

from a paddy land. This Court is of the view that an application made under

Section 34 seeking approval to use a paddy land for a purpose other than an

agricultural purpose, namely to extract minerals from such paddy land would

have to be considered in conjunction with the provisions of Section 36(1) of the

Act. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent cannot entertain an application to extract

minerals from a paddy land unless the applicant is the owner of the land. In

determining who the owner is, the 1st Respondent may seek a direction from the

4 th Respondent who in turn would be bound by its by-laws. The requirement in

Section 36(1) with regard to the steps that must be taken when a tenant

9

cultivator does not give his consent needs to be considered only if the ownership

requirement has been satisfied.

In the above circumstances, this Court holds that in terms of the provisions

contained in Sections 34 and 36 of the Act, the 1st Respondent cannot grant

permission ahd / or a recommendation to any person permitting the use of a

paddy land for the extraction of minerals unless that person is the owner of the

said paddy land or that person has satisfied the ownership criteria stipulated by

the 4th Respondent for the issuance of a gemming license. This Court accordingly

issues the Writs of Prohibition prayed for in paragraphs (e) and (f) of the prayer to

the petition, prohibiting the 1st Respondent and those acting under him, from

granting approval to the 5th Respondent to extract minerals from the land

pertaining to this application or to use the said land for any purpose other

agricultural purposes, unless and until the 5th Respondent satisfies the ownership

criteria laid down by the 4 th Respondent. This Court makes no order with regard

to costs.
