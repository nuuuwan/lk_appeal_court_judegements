A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Officer in Charge of the Piliyandala Police filed information in terms

of Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979,

(hereinafter referred to as the Act) in the Magistrates Court of Kesbewa, against

the 2nd party Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) and the

1 st party Respondent-Respondent, (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent)

based on several complaints made by the Respondent between the period of

05/ 1212004 to 09/0112006, (the information filed was based on a complaint made

on 09/0112006) that the Appellant had removed the fence and encroached into the

boundaries of the land belonging to the Respondent in order to expand a 4 feet

wide foot path to a 10 feet wide road. The expansion of the alleged roadway has

taken place on the Western boundary of the land belonging to the Respondent.

Having taken into consideration the affidavits and the documentary evidence filed

by both parties, the learned Magistrate by order dated 25105/2006, held in favour

of the Respondent to have the existing fence boundary maintained until the issue is

finally resolved by a competent court. A revision application against the said

Page 30f7

order was dismissed by order dated 09/0112008, made by the learned High Court

Judge of the Western Province holden in Panadura. Being aggrieved by the said

order of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellant is before this Court.

The Appellant has urged the following grounds of Appeal for

determination.

The judgment dated 09/0112008 made by the learned High Court Judge is

contrary to law and facts of the case.

The order made by the learned Magistrate in terms of Section 69( I) of the

Act is bad in law.

The learned Magistrate failed to consider the evidence placed before him

under Section 68 of the Act.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows.

The Petitioner purchased the land bearing Assessment No. 130/SIB, on

3011112004, by virtue of Deed of Transfer bearing No. 3963 marked "2 OJ I". By

the said deed the Petitioner had no entitlement to a 10 feet wide road as claimed.

The Petitioner relies on the affidavit evidence filed by his predecessor in title of

the said land who states that there was a 10 feet wide road for more than 40 years,

where paddy seed and harvest was transported by cart. The Petitiner also relies on

2 hand written uncertified photo copied documents with no reference to a Criminal

Information Book number, purported to be observations made by the police

regarding the said land which are filed of record at pages 37 and 38 of the brief.

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the learned Magistrate instead

of deciding the possessory rights of the Respondent under Section 68(3) of the Act

has erroneously decided the case under Section 69(1) of the Act as a dispute over a

right of way.

The police filed information before the learned Magistrate on a complaint

made by the Respondent to the effect that the encroachment by the Appellant

resulted in the disturbance to the possessory rights of the Respondent over the said

land. Action was instituted as a result of the widenning of the foot path towards

the Western boundary of the land belonging to the Respondent. It is also noted that

in the affidavit filed of record, the Respondent has prayed for relief in terms of

Section 69( I) of the Act.

In Ponnamperuma Arachige Sunil Kumara Vs. Nanayakkarawasam

Patudoowa Vidanalage Gnanawatlzie, CA (PHC) 20712006 Decided on

1310212017, H.c.J. Madawala J. held that,

"although it is popularly stated that evidence in relation to title and right of

possession of the land in dispute cannot be considered in a Section 66 action, still

in a situation when the evidence as to possession is clearly balanced title is

important as the presumption of possession will benefit the party who brings in

evidence of title to the Section 66 action. "

In the above context, it is observed that the schedule to Deed No. 1194

dated 18/06/ 1990, marked " 1 v I", clearly shows that the road in dispute was a

Page 5 of 7

foot path (Page 106-108 of the brief). Plan No. 3344 marked "I OJ 2", (at page

181 of the brief) confirms this position. The said Deed bearing No. 3963 marked

"20J I", does not show a 10 feet wide road as claimed by the Appellant. It is also

observed that in the schedule to Deed No. 1194 attested on 18/06/ 1990, shows that

what is in dispute is a footpath .

In paragraph 3 of the affidavit filed by the Appellant (at page 77 of the

brief), it is stated that before purchasing the land the Appellant was aware that

plan bearing No. 1842, marked "20J2(q)", (at page 199 of the brief) dated

19/0512005, was made 2 months prior to the execution of the deed. In the said

plan, the disputed road is 1 0 feet wide. The Deed bearing No. 3963 relied upon by

the Petitioner to claim title to the land was attested on 3011112004. Therefore, it is

surprising to note that the 10 feet road alleged to have being in existance and used

by the Petitioner did not transfer to the Appellant in title. What is more surprising

is that the said plan bearing No. 1842 relied upon by the Appellant to assert his

claim to a 10 feet wide road has been made after the first of several complaints

(first complaint made on 05112/2004) the Respondent made to the police.

Tudor Vs. Anulawathie and Others (1999 3 SLR 235) Gunawardana, J.

held that,

"The ultimate object of Section 68, and Section 69 being to restore the person

entitled to the right to the possession of land to the possession thereof or to restore

the person entitled to the right (other than the right to possession of land) to the

enjoyment thereof- the said provision of the law must be rationally construed to

Page 6 of 7

authorise by necessary implication if in fact they had not in terms done so, the

removal of all obstructions if the need arise, in the process of restoring the right to

the person held to be entitled to such right. "

The schedule to Deed No. 3963, marked as "2 OJ 1" (at page 195 of the

brief) has no mention of Plan No. 1842, marked "2 OJ 2", (at page 199 of the

brief). The schedule to Deed No. 1194, dated 18/06/1990, states that the Western

boundary is Lot 2 and discribes as "qe3 OJO all) OJO c:;". By Deed No. 3963 dated

30/1112004, a right of way has not been transferred to the Appellant who is the

successor in title to the said land.

Taking into consideration the core issue, the learned Magistrate was correct

in deciding the disputed claim in terms of Section 69( 1) of the Act and therefore I

do not see any reason to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate.

For all the above reasons, [ affinn the order of the learned High Court

Judge and dismiss this application.

Application dismissed without costs.
