Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 19th September 20181 the

learned Counsel for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on

the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

The Petitioner has filed this applicationl seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal delivered on 11th May 2011 1 annexed to the petition marked 'All;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order of the National Police Commission

dated 2nd March 2009 1 annexed to the petition marked 'Zll;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 13th Respondentl the Inspector General of

Police to grant the promotions that the Petitioner is entitled to.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner was a Police Constable attached to the Police Department and was

serving at the Uva Paranagama Police Station at the time that a complaint was

made by Ms. Vajira Janaki Sudasinghel the 19th Respondent of an alleged breach

of promise by the Petitioner to marry the 19th Respondent after divorcing his wife.

The 4 th Respondentl who at that time was the Assistant Superintendent of Policel

Bandarawelal acting on the said complaint, had directed that a preliminary

6

investigation be carried out by the 3rd Respondent. Upon receipt of the report of

the 3rd Respondent, the 4 th Respondent had issued the Petitioner with a charge

sheet dated 6th April 2004, containing six charges.

The disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner had been conducted by the 2nd

Respondent," who was a serving Assistant Superintendent of Police at that time.

While the inquiry was proceeding, the Petitioner had been served with an

amended charge sheet annexed to the petition marked 'Y1', containing six

charges. This Court has examined the said amended charge sheet and observes

that all charges arise from the illicit relationship that the Petitioner is said to have

had with the 19th Respondent but with each charge containing the following

specific accusation, as a result of which it was alleged the Petitioner had brought

the Police Department into disrepute:

After the recording of the evidence for the prosecution was concluded and having

afforded the Petitioner an opportunity of leading evidence on his behalf, the

Inquiry Officer had found the Petitioner not guilty of all charges except charge No.

4. This Court has examined the report of the Inquiry Officer, annexed to the

petition marked 'Y2' and observes that the Petitioner has been found not guilty of

five charges for the reason that the prosecution had failed to prove the specific

accusation contained in each of the said charges, and not because of a failure by

the prosecut ion to establish the main allegation against the Petitioner that the

Petitioner had an illicit relation ship with the 19

th Respondent and that he had

8

breached his promise of marriage. This is borne out by the following two

paragraphs from the report 'Y2':

The actions that the Disciplinary Authority may take on receipt of the report of

the Inquiry Officer have been set out in Chapter XLVIII Section 22.5 of the

Establishments Code and reads as follows:

"A Disciplinary Authority may, after careful study of the report of a formal

disciplinary inquiry forwarded to him by the Tribunal, arrive at the following

decisions:

1) Convict the officer of one or some or all of the charges . .

9

2) Acquit the accused officer of one or some or all of the charges.

3) Quash the proceedings of the formal disciplinary inquiry and order a

fresh disciplinary inquiry."

Having considered the report of the Inquiry Officer marked 'Y2', the 1st

Respondent, lDeputy Inspector General of Police, Uva Province who was the

disciplinary authority of the Petitioner had issued the disciplinary order annexed

to the petition marked 'Y3', agreeing with the findings of the Inquiry Officer. The

1st Respondent, while holding that the Petitioner is guilty of charge No.4, had

acquitted the Petitioner of charge Nos. 1-3, 5 and 6. The punishment imposed on

the Petitioner by the Disciplinary Authority was the deferment of four salary

increments.

Being dissatisfied with the said Order of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner filed an

appeal with the National Police Commission.! The primary complaint of the

Petitioner was that the Inquiry Officer had acted on the sole testimony of the 19th

Respondent and that the evidence of the 19th Respondent had not been

corroborated. The Petitioner had also stated that in terms of Sections 10.3 and

10.4 of Chapter VII of the Establishments Code, an increment can only be

deferred upto a maximum of one year and therefore, the punishment imposed on

the Petitioner is illegal. The National Police Commission, having considered the

I The National Police Commission has been established in terms of Chapter XVIlIA of the Constitution. The powers of the National Police Commission have been set out in Article 1ssG and in terms of Article 1ssG( 1)(a), "the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police, shall be vested in the Commission ." Article 1ssK(2) provides that, "a police officer aggri.eved by any order relating to promotion, transfer or any order on a disciplinary matter or dismissal made by the Inspector-General of Police or a Committee or a Police Officer referred to in Article lssH and 1ssJ in respect of such officer may, appeal to the Commission against such order ... "

10

said grounds of appeal, had dismissed the appeal subject to a reduction of the

punishment to the deferment of two salary increments.2 This Court must observe

at this stage that the argument of the Petitioner on the provisions of Sections

10.3 and 10.4 of Chapter VII of the Establishments Code is misconceived for the

reason that the deferment in Chapter VII is done where the quality and output of

an officer's work has been below standard or inadequate, whereas the deferment

of four salary increments of the Petitioner has been imposed by the Disciplinary

Authority by way of a punishment, as provided in Chapter XLVIII Section 24.3.10

of the Establishments Code.

The Petitioner filed an appeal against the said decision of the National Police

Commission with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Having heard the

Petitioner and the National Police Commission, the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal by its Order marked 'Al' held as follows:

"It appears that the prosecution had led sufficient material to establish

Count No. 1- 6. Therefore, this Tribunal vacates the order of the Disciplinary

Tribunal exonerating the appellant from count Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 and finding

him guilty of only count Nos. 4 and 6. The Tribunal finds the accused officer

guilty of Count Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.'.3

l The Order of the National Police Commission has been annexed to the petition marked 'Z1'. .

3 This Court must observe at the outset that the above order of the Administrative Ap peals Tribunal contains a typographical error in that the reference to the Petitioner having been found guilty of charge Nos. 4 and 6 is incorrect.

11

The Petitioner thereafter filed this application, invoking the Writ jurisdiction of

this Court to quash the said Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal marked

'Al' as well as the Order of the National Police Commission marked 'Zl'.

Although in his petition to this Court, the Petitioner had challenged . the

aforementiohed -Orders of the Disciplinary Authority, the National Polite

Commission and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on three grounds, in his

written submissions, the Petitioner has only addressed Court with regard to the

legality of the order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, as the

Petitioner has not specifically indicated in the written submissions that he has

abandoned the other grounds, and for the sake of completeness, this Court would

consider all three grounds pleaded in the petition.

In considering the three grounds urged by the Petitioner, it would be apt to keep

in mind the following passage of Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs

Minister for the Civil Service4:

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first

ground I would call 'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third

'procedural impropriety'.

4 1985 !\( 374

12

The grounds urged on behalf of the Petitioner falls within 'illegality' which has

been summed up by Lord Diplock in the following manner:

"By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision maker

must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power

and mUst give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a

justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons,

the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable."

The first ground urged by the Petitioner is that a Superintendent of Police does

not have the authority to issue a charge sheet to the Petitioner and that a

disciplinary order cannot be issued by an officer other than a Deputy Inspector

General of Police.

The Chairman of the National Police Commission has issued the following Order

published in the Gazette Notification No. 1299/9 dated 30th July 2003, annexed to

the petition marked '~', which reads as follows:

In terms of the said Order '~/, an officer not below the rank of an Assistant

Superintendent of Police is empowered to issue a charge sheet to a Police

Constable. The charge sheet as well as the amended charge sheet have been

served on the Petitioner by an Assistant Superintendent of Police and a

Superintendent of Police, respectively. Thus, there is no merit in the argument of

the Petitioner.

Furthermore, in terms of the said Order '~/ , an Officer not below the rank of

Deputy Inspector General of Police has the power to defer salary increments of a

14

,

Police Constable by way of a punishment. Accordingly, the 1st Respondent who

was a Deputy Inspector General of Police at that time was empowered to impose

the disciplinary order 'Y3' on the Petitioner. Therefore, this Court does not see

any merit in the first ground urged by the Petitioner.

The next ground urged on behalf of the Petitioner is that in terms of Chapter VII -

Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of the Establishments Code, a salary increment cannot be

deferred for more than one year. This Court has already held that this argument

of the Petitioner is misconceived in law and that the punishment imposed on the

Petitioner is within the provisions of the Establishments Code

This Court would now deal with the final ground urged by the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner, which is that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not have the

power to find the Petitioner guilty of all charges.

The 17th amendment to the Constitution enacted in 2001 introduced provisions

with regard to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. While Article 59(1) of the

Constitution specifies that, "There shall be an Administrative Appeals Tribunal

appointed by the Judicial Service Commission", Article 59(2) confers the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal with "the power to alter, vary or rescind any

order or decision made by the Commission".5

Article 155L of the Constitution further provides as follows:

5 The reference in Article 59(2) is to the Public Service Commissi on .

15

"Any Police Officer aggrieved by any order relating to promotion, transfer, or

any order on a disciplinary matter or dismissal made by the (National Police)

Commission, in respect of such officer, may appeal therefrom to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal established under Article 59, which shall

have the power to alter, vary, rescind or confirm any order or decision made

by the Cbmmission. u

A plain reading of the above provision indicates that while the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal has the power to alter, vary or rescind or confirm any order or

decision, that power is limited to any orders or decisions made by the National

Police Commission.

In this regard, this Court would like to consider the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal Act No.4 of 2002, which contains provisions relating to the filing of

appeals and the powers of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to determine such

appeals.

Section 4 of the Act provides as follows:

"(i) Any .... police officer .... aggrieved by an order or decision made by the

.... National Police Commission, .... may prefer an appeal in writing to the

Tribunal within four weeks from the date of receipt of such order or decision.

(2) An appeal preferred to the Tribunal under subsection (1), shall set out

concisely and precisely the grounds on which the aggrieved .... police officer,

16

.... seeks to have the order or decision against which such appeal is being

preferred altered, varied or rescinded and shall be signed by such officer./I

Section 3(b) of the Act reads as follows:

liThe Tribunal shall have the power to hear and determine any appeal

preferred to it from any order or decision made by .... the National Police

Commission in the exercise of its powers under Chapter XVIII A of the

Constitution./I

The question that this Court must consider is whether the power of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal when determining the appeal is limited to a

consideration whether the decision of the National Police Commission that the

Petitioner is guilty of Charge No. 4 is right or wrong, or whether the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal can consider the facts and circumstances relating

to Charge Nos. 1-3, 5 and 6 and make a determination of guilt, although the said

charges did not form part of the subject matter of the appeal that was considered

by the National Police Commission and hence, did not form part of the order or

decision of the National Police Commission. In other words, whether the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal can only make a determination on Charge 4,

which formed the decision of the National Police Commission, or whether the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal is also entitled to make a determination in

relation to Charge Nos. 1-3, 5 and 6, although the said charges did not form part

of the order or decision of the National Police Commission.

17

The cumulative effect of the above provisions of the Constitution and the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act can be summarized as follows. A police

officer who is aggrieved by the findings of an Inquiry Officer or the Disciplinary

Authority may lodge an appeal with the National Police Commission.6 That appeal

would necessarily be limited to a challenge on the finding of guilt and adverse

conclusions reache-d byth-e Inquiry Officer and/or the punishment imposed by the-

Disciplinary Authority. Thus, the subject matter of the appeal before the National

Police Commission would not cover any charges on which the said police officer

had been exonerated by the Inquiry Officer, unless the Inspector General of

Police, in terms of Article lSSK(l) has lodged an appeal, which is not the case in

this application.

The National Police Commission, in keeping with its mandate, would only consider

the appeal lodged by the police officer and arrive at its decision or order which

would only deal with the issue whether the finding of guilt on a specific charge is

right or wrong and whether the punishment imposed is in terms of the law and if

so, whether it is reasonable or not.

In the event of the National Police Commission upholding the decision of the

Inquiry Officer and the Disciplinary Authority, the police officer who is aggrieved

by the order or decision made by the National Police Commission may prefer an

appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The petition of appeal should 'set

out concisely and precisely the grounds on which the aggrieved police officer

seeks to have the order or decision against which such appeal is being pre.ferred

6 Article lSSK(2) of the Constituti on; supra.

18

altered, varied or rescinded'. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Tribunal shall notify

the National Police Commission of the filing of such appeal, and shall forthwith

forward a copy of such appeal to the National Police Commission/ who shall

thereupon have the power to place before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

for its consideration, objections if any, to or against such appeal.8

, 1

In terms of Section 3(b) of the Act, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has the

power to hear and determine the appeal preferred to it by the police officer and

in doing so, take into consideration the grounds urged in the petition of appeal. In

other words, the matters that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal can consider

are the matters set out in the appeal relating to the decision of the National

Police Commission. In the context of this application, the findings of the Inquiry

Officer and the Disciplinary Authority relating to Charge No.4 was the subject

matter of the appeal before the National Police Commission and hence, the order

of the National Police Commission relating to the said charge and all matters

connected therewith, could be examined by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

However, as the findings of the Inquiry Officer and the Disciplinary Authority

relating to Charge Nos. 1-3, 5 and 6 were not the subject matter of the appeal to

the National Police Commission, were not the subject matter of the decision or

order of the National Police Commission, and hence did not form the subject

matter of the appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal cannot consider the findings of the Inquiry Officer and the

Disciplinary Authority relating to Charge Nos. 1-3, Sand 6.

7 Section 5(1) of the Act. a Section 5(2) of the Act.

This Court is of the view that the power that has been conferred on the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal by Article 155L of the Constitution is to alter,

vary, rescind or confirm any order or decision of the National Police Commission

and does not extend to considering the legality of the decisions of the Inquiry

Officer and the Disciplinary Authority which were not the subject matter of the

inquiry before the National Police Commission and the decision of the National

Police Commission.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that as the finding by the Inquiry

Officer that the Petitioner is not guilty of Charges 1-3, 5 & 6 was not challenged

before the National Police Commission and was therefore never the subject

matter of an order or decision of the National Police Commission, the findings of

the Inquiry Officer on the said charges cannot be reviewed by the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by law.

The Petitioner has not been able to establish any illegality or procedural

impropriety committed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to

Charge No.4. The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to confirm the

decision of the National Police Commission and thereby the finding of the Inquiry

Officer in relation to Charge No.4 is rational as the finding of the Inquiry Officer is

supported by the evidence that was led before him. Furthermore, the punishment

imposed on the Petitioner by the National Police Commission and confirmed by

the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is neither excessive nor unreasonable. The

said decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on Charge No.4 is a d~cision

20

that a sensible person who had applied his mind to the facts led at the inquiry

would have arrived at and is a reasonable decision.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing that

part of the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal 'Al' where it has found

the Petition-er guilty of Charge Nos. 1-3, 5 and 6. The confirmation by the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal of the findings of the Inquiry Officer, the

Disciplinary Authority and the decision of the National Police Commission with

regard to Charge No. 4 and the confirmation by the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal of the punishment imposed on the Petitioner by the National Police

Commission shall stand. This Court has not considered the Writ of Mandamus

that has been prayed for as the Petitioner has not placed any material before this

Court in this regard.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
