Sobitha Rajakaruna SDSG for 1a and 3,d Respondents

D.H. Weerathunga for the 2nd Respondent

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioner on 21.11.2018 and 28.01.2019

1a and 3,d Respondents on 07.01.2019

2nd Respondent on 07.01.2019

Argued on: 14.03.2019

Decided on: 29.07.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking the following relief from Court:

(a) A writ of certiorari to quash the decision taken to cancel documents marked as P6 and P5;

(b) A writ of mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to cancel certificate of declaration

regarding Upasampada bearing no. 48640 marked P2 ofthe 2nd Respondent.

Section 41 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (Ordinance) requires both the relevant

Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya as well as the Commissioner General of

Buddhist Affairs (Commissioner General) to maintain two registers, namely registers of

upasampada bhikkus and sam an era bhikkus.

Section 41(5) of the Ordinance reads:

"41(5) The Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of every nikaya shall from time to time make all such corrections, additions or alterations in his registers as may be necessary to keep up to date his registers of upasampada bhikkhus and samaneras of his nikaya and the relevant details regarding them; and whenever he makes any such modification in his registers he shall forthwith convey that fact to the Registrar- General who shall similarly modify the registers he is required to keep by this section."

The present dispute is on the application of these provisions. It arose as a result of the 2nd

Respondent possessing the following documents at material times to this application:

(1) 2nd Respondent's declaration regarding upasampada bhikshu under section 41 of the

Ordinance bearing no. 48640 (P2)

(2) 2nd Respondent's declaration regarding upasampada bhikshu under section 41 of the

Ordinance bearing no. 45589 (P5)

(3) 2nd Respondent's declaration regarding samanera under section 41 of the Ordinance

bearing no. 68896 (P6)

(4) 2nd Respondent's declaration regarding samanera under section 41 of the Ordinance

bearing no. 38699 (P7)

The 1st Respondent took steps to cancel the documents P5 and P6 consequent to a

recommendation made by the relevant Maha Nayaka Thero by P8. It is this decision that the

Petitioner seeks to quash by a writ of certiorari.

The learned counsel for the 2nd Respondent has raised a preliminary objection that the relevant

Maha Nayaka Thero who wrote P8 is a necessary party and that this application must be

dismissed in limine as he has not been made a Respondent. He relied on the decisions in

Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero and 4 others

[(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 258] and Mahanayake Thero, Malwatte Vihare v. Registrar General et al (39

N.L.R. 186).

Amaratunga J. in Wijerotne (Commissioner af Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Parogoda Wimalawansa

Thero and 4 others (supra at 267) held as follows:

"The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of certiorari is

that the person or authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed

should be made a respondent to the application. If it is a body of persons whose decision

or exercise of power is sought to be quashed each of the persons constituting such body

who took part in taking the impugned decision or the exercise of power should be made

respondent. The failure to make him or them respondents to the application is fatal and

provides in itself a ground for the dismissal of the application in limine. Jamila Umma vs.

Mohamed, Karunarathna vs. the Commissioner of Cooperative Developments; British

Ceylon Corporation us Weerosekara. If the act sought to be impugned had been done by

one party on a direction given by another party who has power granted by law to give

such direction, the party who had given the direction is also a necessary party and the

Page 30f7

failure to make such party a respondent is fatal to the validity of the application.

Mudiyanse vs. Christie Silva, Government Agent, Hambantota." (emphasis added)

In Mahanayake Thera, Malwatte Vihare v. Registrar General et al (supra) Soertsz J. held that the

Registrar-General is under a legal duty under section 41 (5) of the Ordinance to remove the name

of a Buddhist priest from the register on being required to do so by the Maha Nayaka on the

ground that the priest has been expelled from the Order.

Clearly the Supreme Court took the view that the Registrar General at that time (now the

Commissioner General) did not have any discretion in terms of section 41(5) of the Ordinance

and must act as requested by the Mahanayaka Thero. In other words, the Registrar General (now

the Commissioner General) is performing a ministerial act.

Jain and Jain, The Principles of Administrative Law (1988) 4th Ed. at page 325 state as follows:

"Functions dischargeable by the administration may either be ministerial or discretionary.

A ministerial function is one where the relevant law prescribes the duty to be performed

by the concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving nothing to the discretion

or judgment of the authority. It does not involve investigation into disputed facts or

making of choices. The authority concerned acts in strict obedience to the law which

imposes on it a simple and definite duty in respect of which it has no choice."

If that is the correct pOSition then the relevant Mahanayaka Thero is a necessary party and the

application must fail for want of necessary party.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the position is different and that the

Commissioner General need not act on the request of the relevant Mahanaka Thero but must act

diligently without merely carrying out the modification as the relevant Mahanaka Thero or

Nayaka Thero shall instruct him to do.

He relied on the decision in Janananda Therunnanse v. Ratnapala Therunnanse (61 N.L.R. 273)

where Basnayake c.J. held that the corrections, additions or alterations which fall within the

ambit of the section 41(5) of the Ordinance are only such as are of a routine nature and are

undisputed and do not prejudice the rights of others and that the Registrar-General must not

modify the registers he is required to keep unless the corrections, &c., made by the Mahanayaka

or Nayaka fall within the ambit ofthe authority conferred by section 41 (5) ofthe Ordinance.

Page 4of7

The Ordinance requires both the relevant Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya and

Commissioner General to maintain two registers, namely register of upasampada bhikkus and

samanera bhikkus. However a closer scrutiny of section 41(5) of the Ordinance shows that firstly

it is the duty of the relevant Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya to maintain the

two registers and the Commissioner General has been given the duty to modify the registers he

maintains only where the relevant Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya informs him

of a modification made by them to the registers maintained by them.

The Ordinance does not require the Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera to modify the registers

they maintain merely because the Commissioner General modifies the registers maintained by

him. In other words, the registers the Commissioner General is under a duty to maintain are such

registers as reflecting the entries in the registers maintained by the relevant Mahanayaka Thera

or Nayaka Thera ofthe nikaya.

It appears from section 41(6) of the Ordinance that the duty imposed thereby on the

Commissioner General to maintain these registers was to make them accessible to courts as well

as the public for it was recognised that it was not in order to summon the relevant Mahanayaka

Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya to produce them to courts or to make them available to the

public.

It is for those reasons, that even if the view in Janananda Therunnanse v. Ratnapala Therunnanse

(supra) reflects the correct legal pOSition, the relevant Mahanayaka Thero or the Nayaka Thero

must be made a party to an application where the Commissioner General has decided as in this

case to act on the request of the relevant Mahanayaka Thero or the Nayaka Thero under section

41(5) ofthe Ordinance.

There is also the question of delay. The Commissioner General has cancelled P5 and P6 on

19.04.2013 whereas this application was filed nearly four (4) years after the cancellation. In

Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R.

70] Jayasuriya J. held:

" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has discretion to deny him relief having regard

to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief."

The Petitioner has also sought a writ of mandamus compelling the 1" Respondent to cancel

certificate of declaration regarding Upasampada bearing no. 48640 marked P2 of the 2nd

Respondent. The words "corrections., alterations and additions .... as may be necessary to keep

up to date his registers of Upasampada bhikkus .... and the relevant details regarding them" (in

section 41(5) of the Ordinance) suggest no doubt whatever to my mind that both total removal

of the names of bhikkus and alterations, corrections and additions in and to the details were

intended [Mahanayake Thera, Malwatte Vihare v. Registrar General et al (supra at 190)].

This also must fail for want of necessary parties as well as delay.

Amaratunga J. in Wijeratne (Cammissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa

Thera and 4 athers (supra at 268) held that:

"A necessary party to an application for a writ of mandamus is the officer or the authority

who has the power vested by law to perform the act or the duty sought to be enforced by

the writ of mandamus. All persons who would be affected by the issue of mandamus also

shall be made respondents to the application".

Hohfeld' argued that there needs to be an understanding of the true nature of legal conceptions

and relations to obviate the difficulties posed by artificial dichotomies and constructs. He

pointed out that "right", "duty", "liberty "and "no-right" are connected in a fundamental way

with each other. The existence of one brings about the existence of the other. Hofeld identified

only jural correlatives and opposites whereas Glanville Williams identified a third set of jural

relations which he referred to as jural contradictories. In this Situation, the presence of one

conception in one party means the absence of the contradictory in the other party.

As S.N. Silva c.J. held (at page 15) in Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and Others [(S.C.

Appeal Nos. 85/2008 & 101/2008; S.C.M. 01.06.2009]:

"Hence, stated in the form of a jural correlative, mandamus would lie when a statutory

duty is cast upon a public authority with a correlative right to demand its discharge."

I Some fundamental legal conceptions as applied in judicial reasoning, Volumes 23(1913) and 26(1917) of the Yale law Journal

Page 6 of7

In terms of Section 41(5) of the Ordinance the duty of the Commissioner General to modify the

register arises only where the relevant Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka Thera of the nikaya has

made a request. There is no such request to cancel P2. Hence no mandamus can be issued

directing the 1a Respondent to cancel P2. In any event the relevant Mahanayaka Thera or Nayaka

Thera of the nikaya who can make that request will be affected by a writ of mandamus but has

not been made a Respondent.

On the issue of delay, P2 was registered in 2012 whereas this application was filed five years later

in 2017.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application without costs.
