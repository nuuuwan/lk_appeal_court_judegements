Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up on 1ih July 2019, the learned Counsel for the

Appellant and the learned State Counsel for the Respondent moved that this

Court pronounce its judgment on the written submissions that had been filed

on behalf of the parties.

This is an appeal filed in terms of Section 49 of the Land Survey Act No. 17 of

2002, (the Act) seeking to challenge an Order made by the Land Survey Council

(the Council) on 10th June 2016 suspending the Annual Practicing License of the

Appellant for the period 1st July 2016 - 30th June 2017, and the imposition of a

sum of Rs. 10,000 as costs of the Council.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Appellant states that he joined the Survey Department in 1960 and served

as 'a Government Surveyor until 1982. Since th~n, the Appellant has been

engaged in private practice as a surveyor. The Appellant states further than in

terms of Section 41 of the Act, he is deemed to be a registered surveyor and

that on an application submitted by him, the Survey Council has issued him

with an Annual Practicing License, which enabled the Appellant to call himself

a 'Registered Licensed Surveyor'.

Bya letter dated 10th July 2015, A.M.Nizardeen had filed a complaint with the

Council against the Appellant. In the said complaint, Nizardeen had st,ated that

the Appellant had surveyed a land in extent of 2A belonging to Nizardeen and

prepared Plan No. 3019 dated 14th July 1993, sub-dividing the said land into 20

2

lots, numbered as Lots 1-20. A copy of this Plan had been annexed to the

complaint marked '01'. There is no dispute between the parties that '01' was

prepared by the Appellant.

Lot NO. 3 in '01' contained an extent of 18P. Nizardeen states that Lot No. 3

was subsequently sub-divided as Lot Nos. 3A and 3B and that Lot No. 3A had

been sold by him to one Thambyrajah, by Deed of Transfer No. 9896 dated 15th

October 2007. Although a plan depicting the said sub-division of Lot No. 3 into

two lots of 3A and 3B has not been submitted, '01' shows the manner in which

Lot No. 3 had in fact been sub-divided.

Nizardeen states that the Appellant had thereafter connived with Thambyrajah

and issued Plan No. 3019/3A which has been annexed to the complaint marked

'02', depicting Lot No. 3A. The grievance of Nizardeen is that the western

boundary of Lot NO.3A as depicted in '02' does not tally with the western

boundary of Lot No.3 in '01'. This Court has examined '01' and observes that

the western boundary of Lot 3 is not a straight line, whereas the western

boundary in '02' is straight. The length of the northern boundary and the

southern boundary of the Lot shown as 'A' on Lot NO.3 of '01' also appears to

be different in '02'.

The Appellant had issued a further Plan numbered as 3019, annexed to the

complaint marked '03' depicting Lot No. 3B, with the western boundaries

being Lot Nos. 1 and 2 of '01' and the eastern boundary being Lot No. 38. Lot

No. 3B cannot have the same lot as its boundary; and it is the position of

Nizardeen that these boundaries are in fact the boundaries of Lot No. 3A.

3

The complainant has stated further that the Appellant had issued two other

plans, annexed to his complaint marked 'OS' and '06' which depict Lot No. 1 of

'01'. Although 'OS' and '06' depict the same lot and has been prepared

according to the same scale, it is the position of the complainant that the

boundaries are different.

This Court must observe at this stage that a common feature of all the plans

referred to above is that none of them contain a schedule of the boundaries of

each lot, as is generally done when preparing a survey plan.

The essence of the complaint of Nizardeen relates to acts of professional

misconduct on the part of the Appellant. Provisions with regard to professional

misconduct are contained in Section 45 of the Act. The portions of Section 45

which are relevant to this application are re-produced below:

"A registered surveyor shall be guilty of professional misconduct if he is

found in any proceedings or appeal-

(a) to have been negligent or incompetent in the conduct of any

survey;

(b) ta have failed to comply with any guidelines or directions pertaining

to the practice of surveying or the requirements pertaining to the

preparation of and maintenance of survey plans and cadastral maps

as are prescribed;

(c) to have certifie ~f as to the accuracy 0/ any surveyor any plan or

map in relation to a survey-

4

Website Copy Website Copy

(i) where such surveyor being an officer in the service of the

Government has conducted the surveyor certified the plan or

map without exercising due care or caution;

(ii) where such surveyor being a registered licensed surveyor ;-

(A) has conducted such surveyor certified such plan or map,

without exercising due care or caution;

(8) .... ;

(e) .... ;

(0) has certified to the accuracy of such survey, map or plan

knowing it to be defective;

(d) .... ,

(e) .... ,

(f) "

Pursuant to the receipt of the said complaint, the Council had requested the

Appellant to submit his response, which was duly complied with by the

Appellant through his letter dated 16th October 2015. With the said letter, the

Appellant had submitted a copy of Plan No. 3019 depicting Lot No. 3A bearing

his signature<and a copy of Plan No. 3019 containing all 20 lots, signed by him,

which Plan bears an endorsement that it has been approved by thi . Matale

Municipal Council. The Appellant had super imposed Lot No. 3A on the latter

5

Website Copy Website Copy

plan, which very clearly shows that the boundaries of Lot No.3A encroach on

the boundaries of Lot Nos. 1, 2 and 3B, thereby confirming the complaint of

Nizardeen.

Section 46 of the Act provides for the holding of an inquiry. Sub-section (4)(b)

reads as follows:

"At an inquiry held under this section, the Council shall-

(i) act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of

the case, without reljard to technicalities and legal norms; and

(ii) not be bound by the rules of evidence, but may inform itself on any

matter in such manner as it thinks fit."

The Council had accordingly requested the Appellant and the Complainant to

be present for ai' inquiry. On 29th October 2015, the Complainant had made a

statement confirming the above matters. The Appellant had not attended the

inquiry due to ill health and the Council had therefore issued the following

qUestionnaire dated 22nd January 2016 to the Appellant, and requested that he

provide his explanation:

This Court must observe that the above explanations called from the Appellant

related to negligence, incompetence, certifying a plan without exercising due

care or caution, and certifying the accuracy of a survey plan knowing it to be

defective, which are all matters on which a Registered Licensed Surveyor can

be found guilty of professional misconduct, in terms of Section 45 of the Act.

The Appellant, by his letter dated 5th March 2016 admitted that h:e carried out

a survey of the said land but took up the position that he requested the

7

Website Copy Website Copy

Complainant to produce his deed in order to prepare the final plan, and that as

he failed to do so, he did not issue a certified copy of the said Plan. This Court

must observe that the Appellant, having admitted the complaint of Nizardeen

by his letter dated 16th October 2015, failed to respond to any of the queries

raised by the Council by its aforementioned letter of 22nd January 2016.

The Council, by its decision dated 10th June 2016 held as follows:

"~>OOO ~~oe 1ll=(!@eD ~aSel) ~) ett~eD ~~ @ID ~

This Court must observe at this stage that the above punishments imposed on

the Appellant are within the powers conferred on the Council by Section 47 of

the Act.

Dissatisfied by the said decision, the Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court in terms of Section 49 of the Survey Act.

This Court would now consider the grounds of appeal set out in the written

submissions tendered on behalf of the Appellant.

8

Website Copy Website Copy

The first and second grounds of appeal are that the Council did not take into

consideration the explanations offered by the Appellant. As observed earlier,

the complaint of Nizamdeen was that the Appellant had issued copies of Plan

No. 3019 marked '02' and '03' in respect of Lot No. 3/\ and Lot No. 3B,

respectively, depicting boundaries that were different from the boundaries

shown in the original Plan No. 3019 marked '01'. The Appellant's initial

explanation, offered by his letter dated 16th October 2015 amounted to an

admission of the complaint against him. It was only after clarifications were

sought that the Appelant denied the issuing of the certified copies marked '02'

and '03', and took up the position that the land is not owned by Nizardeen.

However, the complainant had produced the certified copies of such Plans

before the Council on 2ih May 2016/ thus rebutting the position taken up by

the Appellant that he did not issue certified copies of 'D2' and '03'. The

explanation offered by the Appellant, which is one of denial, has therefore

been rejected by the Council, and hence, this Court is of the view that the

argument of the Appellant that the Council did not take into consideration the

explanations offered by the Appellant has no merit.

The third ground of appeal was that necessary guidelines stipulating offences

which amount to professional misconduct had not been stipulated. The fourth

ground of appeal is that the rules that are said to have been violated has not

been specified. These two grounds will be considered together. This Court

must observe that the explanations called from the Appellant, by letter dated

22nd January 2016, is not referable to a particular rule or guideline, and hence,

reference to, a rule or guideline in the decision of the Cmmcil is not correct,

suffice to st,ate that the Council did have the power to inquire into the matters

1 Vide page 1 of the Order of the Council.

set out in Section 45. Thus, the Council did act within its powers when it called

for explanations in respect of the following:

(a) The Plan '01' did not contain the boundaries of the land, which is a

fundamental requirement of any survey plan;

(b) The date on which the survey plan has been issued has not been

specified in the Plans marked '02' and '03';

(c) The boundaries of Lot N.o. 3A in Plan No. '02' and '04' does not tally

with the boundaries in Plan '01'.

Section 45 of the Act is not limited to a violation of a guideline or rule, for a

surveyor to be found guilty of misconduct. In terms of Section 45, a surveyor:

(a) who has been negligent in the conduct of any survey;

(b) who certifies as to the. accuracy of any plan without exercising due care and

caution; and

(c) certifying as to the accuracy of a plan, knowing it to be defective,

is guilty of professional misconduct. Hence, this Court does not see any merit

in the third and fourth grounds of appeal. This Court must state that the

evidence before the Council, which has been referred to earlier in this

l judgment, was sufficient to find the Appellant guilty of professional

misconduct.

10

The final ground of appeal is that the Council failed to appreciate that the Plan

complained of had been drawn in 1993, whereas the Act was introduced only

in 2002. There is no dispute that the Plan '01' had been drawn in 1993. The

complaint of Nizardeen is that he sold Lot No. 3A to Thambyraja in October

2007, and that the Appellant connived with Thambyrajah and prepared the

Plan '02'. This could not have happened prior to Thambyrajah purchasing the

property, and even though '02' is not dated, it is clear that the incident

complained of occurred after the Act came into force. In any event, the

Appellant was required to specify the date on which he certified the copies of a

Plan drawn by him, which he has failed to do. Furthermore, whether the

incident complained of, was before or after the Act came into force is a fact

which was within the knowledge of the Appellant which he could have proved

by providing the relevant material to the Council. If it was the position of the

Appellant that he had issued a draft of a plan at the request of Thambyrajah,

he could have very well explained when such request was made. The Appellant

has however failed to provide any material in this regard, probably for the

reason that this ground of appeal was never raised before the Council. For the

said reasons, the final ground of appeal too is rejected by this Court.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the grounds of

appeal placed before this Court by the Appellant. This Court affirms the

decision of the Respondent dated 10th June 2016 and accordingly, this appeal

shall stand dismissed, without costs.
