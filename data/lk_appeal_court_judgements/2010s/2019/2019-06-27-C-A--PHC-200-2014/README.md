The Appellant has preferred this Appeal against the order of the learned

High Court Judge of the Central Province holden in Kandy dated 10112/2014, inter

alia, seeking mandates in the nature of writs of certiorari and mandamus

respectively, to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent (Commissioner of

Cooperative Development of the Central Province), dated 3010412012, marked P6,

and to direct the said Respondent to inquire into the said Appeal.

3

The Appellant preferred the said Appeal against the award of the 3rd

Respondent, (Arbitrator) who inquired into a dispute between the Appellant and

the 2nd Respondent (Teldeniya Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited) to

recover a shortfall ofRs. 861,267.75/- from a fuel station, in which the Appellant

was the manager. According to the award dated 29/0212012, the Appellant was

served with a letter of demand to recover Rs. 621,162.00/-.

The 1 st Respondent rejected the said Appeal under Rule 49(xii)(b) of the

Cooperative Societies Rules -1973, published in the Extraordinary Government

Gazette No. 93/5, dated 10/0111974, made under Section 61 of the Cooperative

Societies Law No.5 of 1972.

Rule 49(xii)(a) and (b) reads as follows;

"(aJ Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of an arbitrator or a panel of

arbitrators shall be made within 30 days from the date of the award by a written

statement setting out the grounds of appeal. Every such appeal shall be forwarded

to the Registrar with an appeal deposit of Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum awarded

where the appeal is made by the party against whom the award has been made

and by Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum claimed in the dispute where the appeal is made

by the party claiming any sum of money, whichever sum is the higher sum in either

case.

4

(b) An appeal not made in conformity with the above shall be rejected by the

Registrar. "

In terms of the said Rule, a person appealing against an award of an

Arbitrator is mandated to deposit an amount of Rs.50 or 10% of the Arbitrator's

award, whichever is higher. However, the Appellant when submitting the Appeal

to the 1 st Respondent has failed to deposit the required amount as stipulated by the

said rule.

Therefore, the 1 st Respondent by letter marked P6, rejected the Appellants

appeal on the basis that the Appellant has failed to deposit 10% of the value of the

award of the Arbitrator under Rule 49(xii)(b) of the co-operative rules, made

under Section 72(2) of the Co-operative Statutes of the Central Provincial Council

No. 10 of 1990, as amended by statute No. 04 of 1993.

The Appellant preferred an Appeal to the High Court of the Central

Province holden in Kandy challenging the said decision of the 1 st Respondent

dated 3010412012, marked P6, rejecting the Appellants appeal dated 28/03/2012.

The same relief has been prayed for in the Petition filed in this Court.

It is important to note that in the prayer to this application, the Appellant is

not challenging the legal requirement prescribing the amount to be deposited to be

ultra vires or the rule making power conferred on the Minister in terms of Rule

49(xii)(a).

5

The counsel for the Appellant in his submissions to Court, challenged the

rejection of the appeal on the following grounds, that,

(a) the amount to be deposited in terms of the said Rule is unreasonable,

in the alternative,

(b) the 1 st Respondent should have informed the Appellant regarding the

amount to be deposited.

In making the determination, the learned High Court Judge was of the view

that Rule 49(xii)(b) is a valid rule and the act of the 1 st Respondent rejecting the

appeal of the Appellant acting on a valid rule becomes a ministerial act, and with

the inclusion of the word "shall" in the rule, it does not confer any discretion on

the 1 st Respondent to consider any other option other than rejecting the appeal.

In Wednesbury Corporation case (1948 -lKB 223), it was held that;

"for instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must direct himself

properly in law. He must call his attention to matters which he is bound

to consider. He must exclude from consideration matters which are

irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey these rules, he

may truly be said to be acting unreasonably".

In arriving at the said judicial pronouncement the term "unreasonable" was

used to mean illegal or is tantamount to a contravention of the law.

6

In the instant case, it is observed that the Appellant did not pay the 10% of

the award but choose to deposit Rs. 20001- as the deposit fee which is contrary to

the said rule. The Appellant does not state the basis of calculation to deposit the

said amount. It is also observed that by letter dated 28/03/2012, marked P5, (at

page 295 of the brief), the Appellant was aware of the amount sought to be

recovered and the amount to be deposited as required by the relevant rule.

In M.K.R. Nimal Jayasuriya vs. Seemahasahitha Mitipola Sakasuruwam

Saha Naya Ganudenu Pilibanda Sampapakara Samithiya and 02 others CA.

Application No. 88912000 decided on 1210212004, the Court held that;

"in terms of Rule 49(xii)(a) a deposit of Rs. 50/- or 10% whichever is

higher is a mandatory requirement to entertain an appeal by the 2nd

Respondent. The Petitioner having refused to deposit this sum; the

rejection of the appeal by the 2nd Respondent is in keeping with the

Provisions of the Statute.

The Appellant supports his contention relying on the judgment in Sebastian

Fernando v. Katana Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd., and others (1990) 1

SLR 342. However, in the said case the Supreme Court made reference in obiter to

the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a) and the requirement of an appeal deposit, which can be

clearly distinguished from the issues raised by the Appellant in the instant case.

..

7

In all the above circumstances, I am of the view that, complying with the

requirement of depositing the amount required as stipulated, in terms of Rule

49(xii)(a), is a mandatory requirement to pursue an appeal. Therefore, the

Appellants default to deposit as required, warrants a rejection of the Appeal.

Accordingly, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
