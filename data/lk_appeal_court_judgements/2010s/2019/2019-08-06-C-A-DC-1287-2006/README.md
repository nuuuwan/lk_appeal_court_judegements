Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 4th Defendant-Appellant has filed this appeal against the

Judgment of the District Court of Tangalle dated 14.06.2005

entered in Partition Case No. 2541/P.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court to partition the

land known as Rukaththana Koratuwa alias Weliyage Watta in

extent of about 7 Kurunis of Kurakkan sowing area.

The Preliminary Plan is Plan No. 2973 marked at the trial X and

the Report is X1. There are 4 Lots in the Preliminary Plan. The

main Lots are Lots 1 and 4, and Lots 2 and 3 are roads running

across the land.

The 10th Defendant in his statement of claim has sought exclusion

of Lot 4 on the basis that it is a different land by the name of

Rukaththana Hena alias Weliyage Watta in extent of 1 Acre.

3

At the trial, the 10th Defendant has produced Deeds marked 10D1-

10D6 to substantiate this position. The 10th Defendant has also

produced extracts from the Land Registry marked 10D7 to prove

that the 10th Defendants said Deeds were registered in a different

folio under the name of Rukaththana Hena alias Weliyage Watta

and not in the folio where the plaintiffs Deeds were registered.

All the parties have virtually accepted this position and the learned

District Judge in his Judgment has excluded Lot 4 from the corpus

on the basis that it is a different land. There is no appeal against

that finding.

The 4th Defendant-Appellant in his statement of claim has sought

to exclude Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan stating that she has

prescribed to that Lot. It is difficult to understand why the 4th

Defendant seeks exclusion of Lot 1 on prescription. She has in

paragraph 2 of the statement of claim mentioned that two lands,

namely, Rukattanagaha Watta alias Weliyage Hena, and Weliyage

Watta are shown in the Preliminary Plan. Her Deeds tendered at

the trial marked 4D1-4D4, which I will refer to later, relate to the

former land, namely, Rukattanagaha Watta alias Weliyage Hena.

The learned District Judge has rejected this claim of the 4th

Defendant for exclusion of Lot 1 and has accepted the pedigree of

the Plaintiff to conclude that the 4th Defendant is a co-owner of the

land, and as a co-owner she has not proved prescriptive possession

to Lot 1.

This the learned District Judge did predominantly on the basis

that although the 4th Defendant in evidence has stated that she

became entitled to Lot 1 on Deeds 4D1-4D4, she has not in the

4

statement of claim sought such a relief or produced a pedigree, but

rested her entire claim for Lot 1 on prescription.

The learned District Judge also states that the northern and

eastern boundaries of the Plaintiffs Deeds tally with those of the

Preliminary Plan, but none of the boundaries of the 4th Defendants

Deeds tallies with the Preliminary Plan.

I must state that the 4th Defendant has not raised a clear issue on

exclusion of Lot 1 on the basis that Lot 1 is a different land by the

name of Rukattanagaha Watta alias Weliyage Hena (and not the

land the Plaintiff seeks to partition, which is, Rukaththana

Koratuwa alias Weliyage Watta). The learned District Judge is

correct when he says that by way of issues, the 4th Defendant

sought to exclude Lot 1 only on prescription.

I must add that if Lot 1 is a different land, it shall be excluded from

the corpus and in that event, the question of prescription does not

arise. Once the District Judge decides to exclude a portion on the

ground that it is a separate land, he has no right to make further

declarations on that portion, such as, the party on whose

application the exclusion was made has prescribed to that portion

or inherited to the land as that is outside the mandate of the

Partition Judge.1 There may be several other claimants to that

portion of land which is not part of the corpus. The situation is

however different when a co-owner successfully claims for a

separate portion of the land to be partitioned on prescription. In

1 Hevavitharana v. Themis De Silva (1961) 63 NLR 68. The learned District Judge has attempted to do this in respect of Lot 4-vide last five lines of page 8 and first two lines of page 9 of the District Court Judgment.

5

such a situation, the basis of exclusion is establishment of

prescriptive possession against all other co-owners of the land.

I must stress at this point that this being a partition action, the

duty is on the District Judge to identify the real issues among the

parties and take them to the forefront by way of issues and

address them adequately.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, as amended,

imposes that duty on the District Judge in express terms. The

District Judge shall understand that it is a statutory duty cast

upon the Judge in peremptory terms. That section reads:

On the date fixed for the trial of a partition action or on any

other date to which the trial may be postponed or adjourned,

the court shall examine the title of each party and shall hear

and receive evidence in support thereof and shall try and

determine all questions of law and fact arising in that action

in regard to the right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or

in the land to which the action relates, and shall consider and

decide which of the orders mentioned in section 26 should be

made.

Notwithstanding the system of justice which prevails in our

country is adversarial as opposed to inquisitorial, partition action

is an exception. In a partition action the District Judge shall

actively participate in the trial without playing the passive role of

an umpire and safeguard the rights not only of the parties to the

action but also of others who are not parties to the action, as all

are bound by the Judgment, which confers title in rem.

6

In that backdrop, I cannot agree with the learned District Judge

when he has stated in the Judgment that although the 4th

Defendant has stated in evidence that she became entitled to Lot 1

on Deeds 4D1-4D4, she has not in the statement of claim made

such a claim or set out such a pedigree, but claimed Lot 1 on

prescription.

I need hardly emphasize that although practically issues are raised

by the lawyers of the respective parties, the duty is on the Judge to

raise issues on which the right decision of the case appears to the

Judge to depend. (Section 146 of the Civil Procedure Code) What

is the purpose of pronouncing a Judgment if real issues of the

parties have not been addressed?

As I stated earlier, the learned District Judge has stated that two

boundaries of the Plaintiffs Deeds tally with the northern and

eastern boundaries of the Preliminary Plan, but none of the

boundaries of the Plaintiffs Deeds tallies with those of the

Preliminary Plan.

It is seen from the Report of the Preliminary Plan that it is the

Plaintiff who has shown the boundaries to the surveyor. The 4th

Defendant has told the surveyor that Lots 1 and 4 are different

lands.

In that backdrop, it is unfair by the 4th Defendant to say that two

boundaries of the Plaintiffs Deeds tally with the Preliminary Plan

as the boundaries were shown to the surveyor by the Plaintiff.

Why only two? What about the other two boundaries? That

means, the Plaintiff has unable to show all four boundaries of her

Deeds on the ground.

7

The learned District Judge is incorrect when he says that none of

the boundaries of the 4th Defendants Deeds tallies with those of

the Preliminary Plan.

Let me repeat that the 4th Defendant did not dispute the claim of

the 10th Defendant that Lot 4 of the Preliminary Plan is

Rukaththana Hena alias Weliyage Watta, which was accepted

by the learned District Judge. The 4th Defendant claimed Lot 1 on

the basis that it is Rukattanagaha Watta alias Weliyage Hena.

The 4th Defendants Deeds describe the land known as

Rukattanagaha Watta alias Weliyage Hena. The Plaintiff filed the

action to partition the land known as Rukaththana Koratuwa

alias Weliyage Watta.2

Let me take Deed 4D1 produced by the 4th Defendant. There are

three lands described in the schedule to the Deed. The second

land is Weliyage Hena. The boundaries are: North-a portion of the

same land sold by the Government, East-Mahahena Weta, South-

Kongahahena, West-Weliyage Watta Weta.

The boundaries of the second land known as Weliyage Hena

described in the schedule to another Deed marked by the 4th

Defendant as 4D3 are also the same.

The boundaries of the second land known as Weliyage Hena alias

Rukattanagaha Hena described in the schedule to the Deed

marked 4D4 are as follows. North-Talagahakoratuwa, East-

Mahahena, South-Kongaha Hena, West-Weliyage Watta.

2 Note the differences among Watta, Hena, Koratuwa etc.

8

What are the boundaries of Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan? The

boundaries of Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan are North-

Talagahakoratuwa, East-Mahahena, South-Kongahawatta, West-

Lot 4 and Ihalahena.

Then how can the learned District Judge say that none of the

boundaries described in the 4th Defendants Deeds tallies with

those of the Preliminary Plan?

There is another vital point which favours the 4th Defendant.

According to the Deeds of the 10th Defendant produced marked

10D1-10D6 to claim Lot 4 and accepted by Court, the eastern

boundary is Weliyage Hena Meda Weta. The learned District

Judge in the Judgment has particularly stated that the 1st

Defendant, 4th Defendant and 10th Defendant have admitted that

Lot 1 which lies to the east of Lot 4 is also known as Weliyage

Hena.3

It is significant to note that it is only the 4th Defendant who claims

on Deeds the land known as Weliyage Hena. The 10th Defendant

claimed a land known as Weliyage Watta.

Let me now make it clear that all the Plaintiffs Deeds P1-P4 refer

to a land known as Rukattane Koratuwa. In those Deeds there is

no reference to a land known as Weliyage Watta or Weliyage Hena.

All the Plaintiffs Deeds have been registered in the Land Registry

in the folio marked 10D8 where the name of the land is only

Rukattane Koratuwa. As the learned District Judge has pointed

out in the Judgment only the lis pendens has been registered in a

3 Vide last five lines of page 7 and first five lines of page 8 of the District Court Judgment.

9

new folio but connected to 10D8 under the name of the land

Rukattane Koratuwa alias Weliyage Watta. That new folio has

been marked as 10D9. That goes to show that the Plaintiff has

introduced the name Weliyage Watta to Rukattane Koratuwa for

the first time in the plaint of this case and it is on that basis a new

folio was opened in the Land Registry under the name of Rukattane

Koratuwa alias Weliyage Watta to register the lis pendens.

However as the learned District Judge has acknowledged in

granting the relief to the 10th Defendant, Lot 1 is not Weliyage

Watta but Weliyage Hena, which is the land claimed by the 4th

Defendant.

Then it is abundantly clear that there is a serious question in the

instant case as to the identification of the land to be partitioned,

which is Rukattane Koratuwa (alias Weliyage Watta).

In a partition case, identification of the corpus is of paramount

importance. That is the first and foremost thing the District Judge

shall do before embarking upon the arduous task of investigating

title to the land. If the identification of the land is not possible,

there is no necessity to examine the title Deeds or the pedigree.

The title shall be investigated on a properly identified corpus.4 The

duty is, I stress, cast not on the party but on the Court.5 Even at

the stage of writing the Judgment if the mind of the District Judge

is not clear as to the identification of the corpus, he can call for

further evidence on that matter giving prior notice to all the

4 Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi [2010] 1 Sri LR 87, Abeysinghe v. Kumarasinghe [2008] BLR 300, Dias v. Yasatilaka [2005] 3 Sri LR 169 5 Wickremaratne v. Albenis Perera [1986] 1 Sri LR 190 at 199

10

parties. This he can do in a partition case not only in respect of

the identification of the corpus but also on any other matter.6

It is my considered view that the land sought to be partitioned by

the Plaintiff, namely, Rukaththana Koratuwa alias Weliyage Watta

has not been properly identified. Without properly identifying the

corpus, partition is not possible and the action is not

maintainable.

I allow the appeal of the 4th Defendant and set aside the Judgment

of the District Court. The Plaintiffs action shall stand dismissed.

Let the parties bear their own costs.
