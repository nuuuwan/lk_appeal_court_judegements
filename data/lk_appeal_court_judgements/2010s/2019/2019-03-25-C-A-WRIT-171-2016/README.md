Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner is a Lieutenant in the Volunteer Naval Force of the

Sri Lanka Navy and was functioning as the Second in Command

of the English Learning Teaching School of the Naval and

Maritime Academy, Trincomalee when he was informed (in my

view indirectly) by P12 and P13 that he was sent on compulsory

unpaid leave effective from 23.05.2016. He does not know why

he was so sent on compulsory unpaid leave for an unspecified

period. By looking at P12 and P13 even the Court cannot get

any clue about itP12 is a Navy General Signal which cannot be

understand, and P13 is a letter addressed to the Regional

Director of Education of Ibbagamuwa with a copy to the

petitioner. There is no direct letter addressed to the petitioner.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash P12

and P13 by way of writ of certiorari.

When an officer is sent on compulsory leave, nay compulsory

unpaid leave for an unspecified period, he must know why he is

sent on compulsory unpaid leave. That is a rudimentary

principle of natural justice. The decision maker cannot say that

there is no express or implied obligation on his part to give

reasons. If he does not give reasons, he would run the risk of

having acted arbitrarily or will be found to have acted

unlawfully.

In Srimasiri Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner of Elections [2009]

BLR 34 at 39, Shirani Bandaranayale J. (later C.J.) had this to

say on that matter:

On a consideration of our case law in the light of the

attitude taken by our Courts in other countries, it is quite

clear that giving reasons to an administrative decision is an

3

important feature in todays context, which cannot be lightly

disregarded. Moreover in a situation, where giving reasons

have been ignored, such a body would run the risk of

having aced arbitrarily, in coming to their conclusion. These

aspects have been stated quite succinctly in the following

passage, where Prof. Wade had expressed the view that,

(Administrative Law, 9th Edition, pg. 522),

Unless the citizen can discover the reasoning behind the

decision, he may be unable to tell whether it is reviewable

or not, and so he may be deprived of the protection of the

law. A right to reason is therefore an indispensable part of

a sound system of judicial review. Natural justice may

provide the best rubric for it, since the giving of reasons is

required by the ordinary mans sense of justice. It is also a

healthy discipline for all who exercise power over others.

And more importantly,

Notwithstanding that there is no general rule requiring the

giving of reasons, it is increasingly clear that there ae many

circumstances in which an administrative authority which

fails to give reasons will be found to have acted

unlawfully.

By looking at paragraph 2 of P13, it is clear that the petitioner

has been sent on compulsory unpaid leave forever. This is made

amply clear by 2R1 and 2R2 tendered by the respondents with

their statement of objections.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the respondents

admits that the petitioner was sent on compulsory unpaid leave

with effect from 23.05.2016 under the provisions of the Placing on

Compulsory Leave Regulations gazette bearing the date 26th July

4

1957.1 The aforementioned part of the Gazette was tendered by

the petitioner marked P14.

It reads as follows:

Placing on Compulsory Leave Regulations

1. (1) Where the Regular Naval Reserve, the Volunteer

Naval Force, the Volunteer Naval Reserve, or any part

thereof, has been called out on active service under

section 16 of the Act, the Commander of the Navy or any

other officer authorized by him in writing in that behalf,

may, by order published in such manner as the

Commander of the Navy may deem adequate, place on

compulsory leave for such period as may be specified in

that order, and officer or seaman such Naval Reserve,

Naval Force or part thereof who has been called out on

active service.

(2) An officer or a seaman who has been placed on

compulsory leave under paragraph (1) of this regulation

shall not be entitled during the period of such leave to

any pay or allowance or any other emolument which he

may be entitled to under any regulation made under the

Act and for the time being in force.

(c) In this regulation, Act means the Navy Act, No.34 of

1950.

By the above regulation it is clear that the Commander of the

Navy cannot send an officer on compulsory unpaid leave

indefinitely as was done in this case. According to the above

quoted regulation, an officer can be placed on compulsory

1 Vide paragraph 15 of the written submissions.

5

unpaid leave for such period as may be specified in that order.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the respondents admits

that it has not been done.2 If that has not been done, the

decision is procedurally flawed and ultra vires and liable to be

quashed by way of certiorari.

Why there is a requirement to specify a period when an officer is

sent on compulsory unpaid leave? That is mainly, not solely, to

induce the administrative authority to conclude the inquiry

against the officer as quickly as possible. A person cannot be

sent on compulsory unpaid leave forever. It cannot be a

substitution for dismissal of service. They are two different

things and not the same thing.

The learned Senior State Counsel states that the petitioner was

sent on compulsory unpaid leave until an inquiry is held.3

What is the inquiry the respondents are going to hold against

the petitioner? It is crystal clear by P13, 2R1 and 2R2 that the

respondents have already taken the decision to dismiss him

from service, but they have given effect to that decision by

sending him on compulsory unpaid leave indefinitely.

The respondents have tendered 2R3 to say that a Board of

Inquiry has been appointed to look into the alleged misconduct

of the petitioner. This has been done about three months after

the filing of this application, which is clearly an afterthought, if

not a camouflage.

The learned Senior State Counsel states that:

2 Vide paragraph 32 of the written submissions. 3 Vide paragraph 26 of the written submissions.

Volunteer Naval Force Regulations (P15) at section 18

states that an officer may be called upon to resign his

commission (d) if he is temperamentally unfit for the service

of the Navy and (c) if he does not discharge his duties

efficiently. The Reports at 2R1 and 2R2 clearly demonstrate

that a person can even be removed from the service of the

Navy on this ground. The petitioner has merely been

placed on compulsory leave until an inquiry is held. It is

also clear that temperamentally unfit and not

discharging duties efficiently are not defined and it is up to

the authorities to decide. There are no regulations to state

that there must be an inquiry before deciding the same.4

I am perturbed by that line of argument. This is not the

occasion to deal with how and when an officer can be sacked

from service. According to that argument, there is an

untrammeled discretion on the authorities, and an officer can be

removed from service without an inquiry! I flatly reject that

argument.

There is no unfettered discretion. In Gunathileka v. Weerasena

[2000] 2 Sri LR 1 at 6-7, J.A.N. de Silva J. (later C.J.) stated:

It is observed that in Modern Administrative Law the

concept of absolute discretion is unacceptable. Parliament

constantly confers upon Public Authorities, powers which

on their face might seem absolute and arbitrary. But

arbitrary power and unfettered discretion are what Courts

refuse to countenance. They have woven a network of

restriction principles which require statutory powers to be

4 Vide paragraphs 26 and 27 of the written submissions.

exercised reasonably and in good faith for proper purpose

only. Administrative Law - 7th Edition - Wade at page 379.

Justice Dougles in his dissenting judgment in U.S. vs.

Wundarlich (1951) 342 US 98 observed,

Law has reached its finest moments when it has freed

man from unlimited discretion of some ruler, some civil or

military official, some bureaucrats. Where discretion is

absolute man has always suffered. At times it has been his

property that has been invaded; at times his privacy; at

times his liberty of movement; at times his freedom of

thought; at times his life; absolute discretion is a ruthless

master.

These Principles have been explained and elaborated in a

series of English decisions over a long period of time. Lord

Wrenbury in Roberts vs. Hopwood (1925) AC 578 at 613

stated that,

A person who is vested with a discretion must exercise his

discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not

empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is

minded to do so. He must in the exercise of his discretion do

not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he

must by the use of reason, ascertain and follow the course

which reason directs. He must act reasonably.

Removal from service is a serious punishment. Punishment

shall commensurate with the offence committed.

The learned Senior State Counsel has cited Perera v. Attorney

General [1985] 1 Sri LR 185 in the written submission. That

case has no applicability as it deals with civil liability arising out

8

of withdrawal of a commission. The instant application is a writ

application putting the procedure through which the petitioner

was sent on compulsory unpaid leave in issue.

The procedure adopted by the respondents from the beginning is

fundamentally flawed. I quash P12 and P13 by way of writ of

certiorari.

Application is allowed with costs.
