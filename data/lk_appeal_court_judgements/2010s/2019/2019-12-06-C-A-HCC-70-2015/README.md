For the prosecution, evidence of four witnes:;es were led namely, Pravini Shevon

alias Suveni (PW 01 - victim), grandmother of the Victim, Mary Theresa (PW 02),

Police Inspector Senaratne (PW 04) and Dr. Ilangaratna Banda (PW 06).

Productions from "P 01 to P 04" were marked. For defence, the appellant and his

wife, Pathiraja Mudiyanselage Suneetha Irangani, testified and closed the defence

case.

The Learned High Court Judge convicted the appellant for the charge and imposed

four years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- with a default sentence

of four months imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of

appeal, in the written submissions;

I. The Belated Complaint

2. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered whether there was a

reason for Mary Theresa to fabricate a case against the accused

3. Misdirection as regards to the burden of proof

The incident in question can be summarized as follows;

As per evidence of Pravini Shevon (hereinafter referred to as the 'prosecutrix'

and/or 'PW 01 '), she lived with her parents and her grandfather. On the alleged

date of the incident i.e. 09.01.2008, the prosecutrix went to school and came back

around 1.00pm. The prosecutrix changed her clothes and had gone to her

grandmother's (PW 02) house which was situated about 25-30 feet away from the

Page 3 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

prosecutrix's house. The prosecutrix stayed tijere till about 5.00pm and left for her

house to bring a book and the accused invited her to his house, promising to give

biscuits. The appellant was wearing a towel and carrying his small child at that

time. The appellant had taken the prosecutrix into a room of his house and

thereafter, had taken her to the kitchen, where the appellant sat down on a chair put

the small child on the floor. Thereafter, he took the prosecutrix on to his lap and

removed her skirt and the underpants, and placed his penis between her thighs and

sexually abused her.

Subsequently, the prosecutrix had run back to her grandmother's house and

informed the incident to grandmother. The appellant had followed the prosecutrix

and PW 02 had shouted at the appellant for abusing her grandchild. Thereafter, PW

02 had washed a liquid that looked like foam, off the prosecutrix's legs.

On 12.01.2008, a complaint was lodged at the Dingiriya Police Station and the

prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Ilangaratna Banda (PW 06), on 14.01.2008.

The defence version was that his family had a domestic servant in the relevant

period to look after his small child who was 10 months old. The servant comes

every day before his wife goes to work and waits till she returns from her work.

The appellant took up a defence of an alibi and denied the incident stating that on

the date of the incident, the appellant was at home till about 9.00am and thereafter,

attended a Directors meeting of the Bingiriya Cooperative Society. When he came

home his wife and two children were at home. The wife of the appellant, Irangani,

testified for the defence.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant raised the first ground of appeal

in which it was contended that there was a belated complaint in the instant case.

The incident had occurred on 09.01.2008 and Mary Theresa (PW 02), the

Page 4 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

grandmother of the prosecutrix, lodged a yomplaint at the Police Station on

12.01.2008. PW 02 testified that she informed this alleged incident of grave sexual

abuse to the parents of the prosecutrix and the complained was made after three

days. PW 04 - IP Senaratne stated that the complaint to the Police was made on

12.01.2008 (Page 109 of the brief). The Learned President's Counsel for the

appellant further argued that not only this is a belated complaint but also it had not

been made by the parents of Shevon. The complaint was made by the grandmother

of the prosecutrix.

The Learned ASG for the respondent replied to the above contention that neither

the prosecutrix nor PW 02 was cross examined regarding the delay, by the defence

Counsel at the trial.

The Learned High Court Judge did not address about the said delay In his

judgment.

In the case of Karnel Singh V. The State of M.P [1995 AIR 2472, 1995 see (5)

518], it was held that,

" ... It was said that there was considerable delay and sufficient time for

tutoring and therefore her evidence could not be belivered. There is no merit in

this contention. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are

slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens

to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her

husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does

not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to

the police is because of society's attitude towards such women; it casts doubt

and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her.

Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily

Page 5 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

indicate that her version is false. The possibility of tutoring is ruled out

because the evidence does not show that her husband knew the appellant and

his companion before the incident ... " (Emphasis added)

In the case of Ban dar a V. State (2001) 2 SLR 63, it was held that,

"if there is valid reason or explanation for the delay and if the trial judge is

satisfied with the reasons and explanations given, no trial judge would apply

the test of spontaneity and contemporaneity and reject the testimony of a

witness in such circumstances".

It is settled law that, where a complaint is lodged belatedly, a Court can act on

evidence of the prosecutrix, if the complainant gives a plausible explanation about

such delay. In the instant case, there is no such reasonable explanation given by the

prosecution as to why PW 02 waited three days to make the complaint to the

Police. I observe that this was a serious incident involving a little child and yet her

parents did not take the child to the Police and lodge a complaint instantly. I am

unable to agree with the argument of the Learned ASG for the respondent that the

defence did not question about the delay in cross-examination. I am of the view

that it was a duty cast on the prosecution to explain the delay on their part. Since

the burden is on the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, the

prosecution had an inevitable duty to explain such delay. The defence had clearly

questioned the genuineness ' of the complaint of the Grandmother. In such a

backdrop, I am of the view that there were suspicious circumstances as to why PW

02 lodged a belated complaint and therefore, I answer the contention of the

Learned President's Counsel for the appellant in affirmative.

Page 6 of 13

I wish to consider the 2nd and 3rd grounds of agpeal together.

In the second ground of appeal, it was contended that the Learned High Court

Judge failed to consider whether there was a reason for Mary Theresa to fabricate a

case against the appellant.

The appellant and his wife gave evidence for defence case. Both the appellant and

his wife were employed at that time and there was a domestic servant to look after

their small child who was about 10 months old at that time. On 11.01.2008, the

domestic servant had informed the wife of the appellant that she did not want to

come to work hereinafter, since the prosecutrix kept coming to the house to play

with the small child and as a result the child cannot be put to sleep. The wife of the

appellant informed about this issue to the appellant when he came home and the

appellant went to the house of the prosecutrix on the same day and had an

exchange of words with them for sending the child. Thereafter, the belated

statement was made on the next day, i.e. 12.01.2008. It is noteworthy that this is

not a new position taken up freshly at the defence, but taken up even during the

case for the prosecution.

PW 02 was questioned about this incident during the cross-examination and she

admitted that the appellant came on a day in the month of January and quarreled

with them;

Further, I observe that this was suggested to the prosecutrix as well (Page 81 of the

brief) and the PW 02 and the prosecutrix contradicted each other on their answers

to this suggestion.

Page 7 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

I observe that the Learned Trial Judge has cOl;npletely eliminated the possibility to

make a false accusation against the appellant, without giving a reasonable

explanation for such rejection. I am of the view that the genuineness of the

complaint was at stake and the Learned High Court Judge should have considered

the position taken up by the defence more carefully.

In the final ground of appeal, it was contended that the Learned High Court Judge

had misdirected himself as regards to the burden of proof. It was submitted that

defence had been rejected without any legal basis ard it . has occasioned a

miscarriage of justice. It was further argued by the Learned President's Counsel for

the appellant that the prosecutrix has taken diametrically opposing positions in

respect of the vital circumstances pertaining to the act of sexual abuse and the

Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the same.

The Learned ASG for the respondent replied to the above contention that the

contradictions and omissions pointed out by the defence were taken into

consideration by the Learned High Court Judge and it was concluded that the

contradictions and omissions did not fatally affect the instant case.

However, I observe that the prosecutrix in her statement to the Police had stated

that the sexual act was done to her in a room of the appellant's house and in Court,

she testified that the appellant abused her in the kitchen of his house. This was

marked as 'V 01 and V 02' as contradictions by the defence Counsel. Further, an

omission was brought to the notice of the Court during her cross examination that

even though she categorically stated in her evidence that her clothes were removed

by the appellant, she did not state that in her statement made to the police.

Page 8 of 13

The Learned President's Counsel for the app~llant further submitted that although

the prosecutrix, in Court, specifically took up the position that all her clothes were

removed by the appellant, she had given completely different version of history to

the Doctor who examined her;

a1zs.iZSlC) ;5J<.5CJ ZSl<; z:D6J ... " (Page 129 of the Brief)

I am well aware that our law, as it stands today, does not require corroboration

from a prosecutrix in a sexual offence. However, it is settled law that the Trial

Judge will act on a sole testimony of a prosecutrix only if her evidence is cogent,

credible and consistent.

In the case of B. Bhoghinbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat (AIR) 1983 SC

753, it was held that,

" ... in the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to the

injury. "

Page 9 of 13

In the case of Sunil and another V. The Atto.rney General (1986) 1 Sri L.R 230,

it was held that,

"It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could

be acted on even in the absence of corroboration ... "

In Premasiri and another V. The Queen [77 N.L.R 86] it was held that,

"In a charge of rape it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as

to convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth ... "

Therefore, it is understood that Court should not act on the sole testimony of a

prosecutrix if it appears to be unreliable and inconsistent.

I observe that the prosecutrix was only 09 years old at the time of the incident and

therefore, it is natural that there could be mistakes made by her in evidence.

However, I am unable to reject the contradictions pointed out by the defence as

mistakes that she committed due to poor memory.

Another important aspect which needed attention of this Court is the manner in

which the defence was analyzed by the Learned High Court Judge.

The Learned High Court Judge, in the beginning of the judgement, has mentioned

that only the appellant gave evidence for defence case. Even when evaluating the

evidence of the defence, the Learned Judge has evaluated only the evidence of the

appellant. However, the wife of the appellant too had testified for defence, and the

Learned High Court Judge has not at least mentioned about her evidence.

In this regard, the Learned ASG submitted that the evidence of wife was a

description of her marriage to the appellant and this was not considered to be

Page 10 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

material to the instant case by the learned H,igh Court Judge. The Learned High

Court Judge had opted not to mention the evidence of the appellant's wife owing to

the above reason and it cannot be considered a fatal error as it did not affect the

root of the case.

I am unable to agree with the said submission. We are not to make assumptions

about a conclusion arrived by the Learned High Court Judge with regard to any

witness, in the absence of any such conclusion written down by the Judge in his

judgment. The mentioning that "only" the appellant testified for the defence,

clearly manifest that the sufficient attention of the Learned High Court Judge was

not paid to the evidence of the wife of appellant.

Further, I observe that the Learned High Court Judge first evaluated the evidence

of the prosecution and came to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its

case. Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge proceeded to consider the defence.

This is a total misdirection and it is apparent that the Judge had prejudged the case

even before considering the evidence as a whole.

Therefore, it is my view that it certainly has caused prejudice to the appellant since

the defence version was not properly evaluated. For these reasons, the 2nd and 3rd

grounds of appeal should succeed.

In the case ofRadhu V. State of Madya Pradesh [Case No: Appeal (crl.) 624 of

2005, Indian Supreme Court observed that,

"The court should, at the same time, bear in mind that false charges of rape

are not uncommon. There have also been rare instances where a parent has

persuaded a gullible or obedient daughter to make a false charge of a rape

either to take revenge or extort money or to get rid of financial liability.

Whether there was rape or not would depend ultimately on the facts and

circumstances of each case".

Page 11 of 13

In light of above, it is to be understood th,at the Court should be cautious In

convicting an accused for a sexual offence since there is a strong chance of an

accused being falsely implicated. Such conviction should be made only after being

satisfied that the prosecution has built a strong, unchallenged case with credible

evidence.

After perusing the proceedings, it is my considered view that the evidence of the

prosecution lacks consistency and there are fatal errors in the Judgment as well.

Therefore, r am of the view that it is unsafe to convict the appellant in the instant

case. I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant by the

Learned High Court Judge and acquit the appellant.

The appeal is hereby allowed.
