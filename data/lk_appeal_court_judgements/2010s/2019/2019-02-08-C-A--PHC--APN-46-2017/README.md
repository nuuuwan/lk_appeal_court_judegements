The Accused-Petitioner - On 31.10.2018 The Complainant-Respondent - On 03 12.2018

The Accused-Petitioner has filed this r~v ision application seeking to revise the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of Chilaw dated 04.08.2016 in case No.

05/2009.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioner (hereinafter refeLTed to as the 'petitioner') was indicted in

the High Court of Chilaw as follows;

1. The accused committed the Murder of Warnakulasuriya Jerad Lional

Thamel and thereby commItted an offence punishable under secticn

296 of the penal Code.

Page 1 of 14

I

I II. The accused caused Hurt t6 Warnakulasuriya Rani Catherine Iroma

Fernando and thereby comm,itted an offence punishable under section

315 of the Penal code.

The trial was commenced on 09.12.2014 after reading over the indictment to the

petitioner. On 04.08.2016, the first count of the indictment was amencled to section

297 of the Penal Code, by the complainant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 'respondent'), on the basis of sudder fight and on the same day the accused-

petitioner pleaded guilty to both count;.). Accordingly the Learned High Court

Judge had convicted the petitioner and in )osed following sentences;

1. 1 sl Count - a term of 12 years ri~ ,orous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 7,

500/- with a default term of six mOI'lths simple imprisonment.

2. 2nd count - a term of 2 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 7,500/-

with a default term of 06 months simple imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge had further ordered both terms of imprisonment to

run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed a revision application in

this Court seeking to reduce the sentence~ imposed on him.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner 3ubmitted that the Learned High Court

Judge, when sentencing the petitioner, ha\j failed to take into consideration that the

petitioner was not with proper mental condition and he needed continuous

treatment. The Learned Counsel further ~;ubmitted that the sentence imposed IS

excessive and therefore it should be considered as an exceptional circumstance.

The Learned sse for the respondent raised a preliminary objection that there has

been a delay 'of 07 months in filing this revision application. The reason given for

Page 3 of 14

the delay was that the petitioner was una )le to give instructions due to his medical

condition. The Learned SSC contend l d that said mental inability is not a

reasonable ground since the accused was, able to give instructions to take a plea for

a lesser offence than what he was initially indicted.

We observe that the order ' challenged is dated 04.08.2016 and 'the petition

submitted to this Court is dated 27.03.20;17. The petitioner, without exercising the

right of appeal, has filed a revision applil;ation in this court. We observe that there

has been a considerable delay in filing this revision application. Our Courts have

taken the view that the inordinate delay in seeking relief itself disentitles the

petitioner to it since revisionary power is ;" discretionary remedy.

It was held in the case of Seylan Bank V Thangaveil [2004] 2 Sri L.R 101, that;

"In this application in revision tHe petitioner seeks to set aside the orders

'I dated 7.3.2002 and 10.01.2003 made by the learned District Judge. The

petitioner has filed this application on 17.7.2003. It appears that there is a

delay of one year andfour months ~n respect of the order dated 7.3.2002 and

a delay of seven monthsfrom the ol der dated 10.01.2003. The petitioner has

not explained the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking

relief by way of revision, which is :J discretionary remedy, is a factor which .

will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review should

be made promptly unless there arc good reasons for the delay. The failure

on the part of the petitioner to e>.plain the delay satisfactorily is by itself

fatal to the application ... "

Page 4 of 14

In the case of Attorney General V. Kllllchihambu [46 NLR 401], it was held

that,

" ... the sentence was passed in r. ebruary, 1945 and this application was

t made on May 25, 1945, and now it is the end of July. In view of the delay

;r that has occurred I do not think I ,ought to exercise the discretion vested in

me by section 357(1) of the Criminal Procedure C.ode. "

.'

In the case of Paramalingam V. Sirised.a and another [2001] 2 Sri L.R. 239, it

was held that,

"Laches means negligence or unreasonable delay in asserting or enforcing

a right. There are two equitable principles which come into play when a

statute refers to a party being gu.1ty of laches. The first doctrine is delay

defeats equities. The second is t'0at equity aids the vigilant and not the

indolent ... "

In light of the above it is understood that Ithe party who seeks such relief should act

promptly.

However the Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that in terms of the

powers given in section 364, the Court pf Appeal has revisionary jurisdiction il1

respect of the legality or propriety of any sentence unlike in civil cases.

Accordingly when the sentence is excess ~ve or inadequate the Court of Appeal has

jurisdiction to revise the sentence despite a delay or despite the fact that no appeal

had been preferred. The Learned Coun.3el has submitted the case of Attorney

General V. Ranasinghe and others [1993] 2 Sri L.R. 81, in which it was held

that,

" ... It is clear on a perusal of t~!e judgment, that this Court refused to

exercise revisionary jurisdiction p,:imarily on the basis that the petitioner

Page ;: of 14

had not availed himself of the leave to appeal procedure set out in the Civil

Procedure Code ... We have to observe that this consideration does not apply

in relation to a criminal case w!u:;ye the jurisdiction is exercised in terms of

section 364 of the Code of C'iminal Procedure. Furthermore we are

inclined to agree with the submis -ion of the learned SSC that the decisions

of the Supreme Court in the cases I of the Attorney-General vs. H. N. de Silva

(2) and Gomes vs Leelaratne (rU firmly establish the principle that in

considering the propriety of a senfence that has been passed, this Court has

a wide power of review, in revisihn. This jurisdiction is not fettered by the

fact that Hon. Attorney-General has not availed of the right of appeal. .. "

In the case of Buddhadasa Kaluaradlchi V. Nilamani Wijewickrama and

Another [1990] 1 Sri L R 262, it was he1ld that,

"The trend of recent decisions is that the Court of Appeal has the power to

act in revision even though the procedure by way of appeal is available in

i appropriate cases. In Rustom v. J-!apangama & Co. (4) it was held that the

powers by way of revision confer .. ed on the appellate cour, are very wide

I :i; and can be exercised whether an JPpeal has been taken agdiJ.lstan order of

the original court or not. Howeve'v such powers would be exercised only in

exceptional circumstances where an appeal lay and as to what such

exceptionable circumstances are,; is dependent on the facts of each case.

Vythialingam, J. stated in Rustom v. Hapangama & Co (supra) "where an

I order is palpably wrong and affects the rights of a party also, this court

\ would exercise its powers of rev is ion to set as ide the wrong irrespective of

whether an appeal was taken or was available... "

We observe that the Learned Counsel J' as explained the reasons for the delay in

filing the revision application. Therefore we decide to overrule the preliminary

objection since it is important to conside:- the merits or this case.

The Learned Counsel who appeared for :the petitioner in the High Court requested

I to call a medical report on 04.05.2010 since the petitioner was suffering from a

mental disorder. According to the report,dated 28.02.2011 marked as "X4", Doctor

Aruni Abeysinghe had examined the p{ titioner on 28.02.2011 and submitted that

the petitioner was suffering from SchizOt?hrenia. However the Learned High Court

Judge had ordered for a further medical report since the said medical report was

not sufficient. The Learned State Coun~d on 20.10.2011 had informed Court that

according to the new medical report the petitioner was unfit to plead and stand for

trial. Thereafter the Learned High Court Judge ordered the petitioner to undergo

treatments continuously and called fo"; another medical report. Thereafter on

08.06.2012, the Learned High Court :Judge had ordered the petitioner to be

produced to the consultant psychiatrist Dr. Neil Fernando in the Mental Hospital

(Teaching) Angoda. In the said report it was informed that the petitioner was fit to

plead and stand trial.

The Learned Counsel for the petitionel submitted that according to the medical

report of Dr. Neil Fernando, the petition~r was suffering from mental disorder fro~

the age of 16 years (Medical report mar~ed as 'X5' in the brief). Accordingly the

Learned Counsel contended that the Leaned High Court Judge, when sentencing

the petitioner, had failed to consider the -tnental condition of the petitioner.

The Learned SSC contended that the defence of insanity was never taken in thifs

case and the evidence already led esta~lished that the accused was conscious 9.f

what he was doing.

Page " of 14

It was held in the case of Attorney General V. Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and

another [1995] 1 Sri L.R 157 that,

"In determining the proper sentence .the Judge should consider the gravity

, of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided /n the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and c() sider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature oJ.which the offender has been found guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The Judge should al~o take into account the nature of the loss

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

d . " etectlOn ...

In the case of The Attorney General V. H.N. de Silva [57 NLR 121], it was held

that,

I

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offende-. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the ~ravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and ~ 'hould have regard to the punishment

1 provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

I charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective ... "

Page 8 'of 14

In the case of M. Gomes (S.I. Police, C' 'imes) V. W.V.D. Leelaratna [66 NLR

233], it was held that,

"/ would also indicate what factOl;s should be taken into consideration by

Judges on the matter of sentence. / proceed to quote from the case of The

Attorney-General v. H. N. de Silva/I). At page 124 Basnayake, A. Cl., (as

he then was) says this: "In assessing the punishment that should be passed

on an offender the judge should ccnsider the matter of sentence both from

the point of view of the public and the offender ... "

To these / would respectfully add:

(5) Nature of the loss to the vicfim. In this case the loss to him was

irreparable, especially in view of tl,e prohibition on the importation of cars

into this country. The victim would have been put to a great deal of

inconvenience if he had to use the public modes of transport. ,

(6) Profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-detection ... "

In the case of The Attorney General V. Mendis [1995] 1 Sri L.R. 138 it was held

that,

"In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,

or after trial, the Trial Judge has c difficult function to perform. That is to

decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been

convicted. In doing so he has to cOl/sider the point of view of the accused on

the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge

must necessarily consider the natur~ of the offence committed, the manner in

which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

Page 9 Jf 14

such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which it

has been committed, the persor.s who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in

committing the crime. The Trh\ . Judge who has the sole discretion in

imposing a sentence which is appropriate having regard to the criteria set

~ out above should in our view not to surrender this sacred right and duty to

any other person, be it counselor, accused or any other person. Whilst plea

bargaining is permissible in ow' 'Jview, sentence bargaining should not be

encouraged at all and must be frowned upon ... "

In the case of Sevaka Perumal etc., V. State of Tamil Nadu [AIR 1991 S.C.

1463),

" ... Protection of society and stanping out criminal proclivity must be the

object of law which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.

Therefore, law as a corner-stone of the edifice of order should meet the

\ challenges confronting the society... Therefore, undue sympathy to impose

inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine

the public confidence in the effi::acy of law and society could not long

endure under serious threats. If the court did not protect the injured, the

injured would then resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore, the duty of

every court to award proper sen.'ence having regard to the nature of the

offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc ... "

In light of above it is understood that :he Judges should consider the matter of

sentence from the point of view of the public as well.

Page 10 of 14

The Leamed Counsel for the petition ~r has submitted the case of Geoffrey

Anthony Thilan Amarasekara V. The Attorney General lCA Case No.

149120121 and contended that the mental condition should be considered as a

mitigatory factor when considering the question of sentence. However we observe

that the facts of said case and the instaht application are manifestly different. In

that case the evidence was submitted to Court demonstrating insanity on the part of

t " the accused-appellant and impelled the COUl1 to reduce the term of imprisonment

on compassionate grounds. It was furth~r submitted about an attempt to commit

I suicide by hanging hi~&elf in his cell oy the accused-appellant. In the case of

Geoffrey Anthony (supra) it was observed that,

"With the kind of sustained derangement that the Accused-Appellant in this

case has displayed we are the of view that it is a travesty to treat his case or

even to actually treat it as if it were in the same degree of criminality as thai:

of a professional assassin, or an 'armed robber who deliberately shoots a

police officer or a security guard or a person who tortures, abuses and kills

I people for sadistic or sexual satisfaction.

In my view, the contention that any murder, whatever the circumstances,

should be regarded as uniquely heinous is also untenable legally.

However the key argument of the Additional Solicitor General is entitled to

much weight even though he did not stand in the way of compassion being

shown to the Accused-Appellant by way of a discounted term of sentence. He

\ argued that it is necessary to protect the public from an otherwise

,. potentially dangerous person. Certainly it carries within it the contentioIJ

that the likelihood of the risk that an offender of this nature may pose, if

released, to kill again. It is axi6matic that the public should, so far a~

Page 11 of 14

reasonably practicable, be proteGted against the risk of violence and if

constant supervision of this Accused-Appellant is undertaken during the

period of incarceration I should regard it as a necessary initial safeguard.

towards the reduction of the potent/pi risk. "

It is imperative to note that the said Geoffrey Anthony case was an appeal

submitted to this Court while the instant 'i)atter is an application for revision. It is

f well settled law that the revisionary jnrisdiction shall be invoked only upon

demonstration of exceptional circumstalll:es like miscarriage of justice. Therefore

revisionary powers cannot be exercised to relieve the grievances of a party. This

position was elaborated in the case of f:ader (On behalf of Rashid Khan) V.

Officer-In-Charge Narcotics Bureau [2Q06] 3 SLR 74, in which it was held that,

"Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is due administration of justice and

not primarily or solely the relevancy of grievances of a party. Revisionary

powers should be exercised where (l miscarriage of justice has occurred due

to a fundamental rule of procedur,~ being violated, but only when a strong

case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice ... "

1

In the case of Vanic Incorporation Ltd V. Jayasekara [1997] 2 Sri L.R 365, it

was held that,

"In the case of Attorney-General " Podi Singho (supra) Dias, J. held that

even though the revisionary powers should not be exercised in cases when

there is an appeal and was not taken, the revisionary powers should be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances such as (a) miscarriage of

justice (b) where a strong case for interference by the Supreme Court is.

made out or (c) where the applicant was unaware of the order. Dias, J alsc:

Page I I of 14

'I observed that the Supreme Court '::n exercising its powers of revision is not

hampered by technical rules of pIe ding and procedure ... "

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 284, it was

! held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

I instantly react to it - the order (omplained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court."

In light of above it is understood that this Court is empowered to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction only if there ha~' been a mistake on the part of the lower

court judgments and/or there has been a miscarriage of justice. Therefore this

Court is not inclined to interfere with an order made by a Learned Judge exercising

the discretion vested on him unless there is an error which warrants this Court to

\

1 exercise revisionary powers. Further we are mindful of the fact that the Judge who

observes the trial in the High Court gets a better opportunity to assess the facts and

the accused.

As per the medical report of the Dr. Neil. Fernando (marked as 'X5') the petitioner

, I had been suffering from an episodic me_.tal illness since the age of 16 years and

the doctor had further instructed to ndergo continuous medical treatments.

However we observe that it is mention~d in the same report that the petitioner

I would have been of sound mind at the time of the alleged offence. Therefore it was . not erroneous to consider the knowle "ge of the accused about the crime he

committed. Further we are of the view that a person with improper mental health

should be kept separated from the society since his behaviour can be a threat to the

1 .J

Page 13 of 14

1

society. There is no guarantee that the petitioner would undergo medical treatments

continuously when he is released to the society.

Considering above, we do not wish to interfere with the sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge of Chilaw. Therefore we affirm the same.

Accordingly this revision application is dismissed without costs.

Registrar is directed to send this order to the relevant High Court of Chilaw.

We further direct the prison authorities to produce the petitioner to a consultant

psychiatrist in the Mental Hospital (Teaching) Angoda periodically to assess the

mental condition of the petitioner.
