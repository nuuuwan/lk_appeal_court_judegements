DEFENDANT, RESPONDENTS

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

Champika Laduwahetti for the Plaintiff-Appellant

W. Dayaratne, PC with Achala Srimal, Nadeeka K. Arachchi and Navinda Pathirage for the 1( a) and 1( c) Defendant-Respondents

12.11.2018

The contest at the hearing of this appeal was focused on a half a share of the corpus

being given to an original owner called Kankanamalage Sawariel Fernando. The

complaint of the Plaintiff-Appellant was that having put in issue that the corpus was

originally owned by eight persons referred to in the plaint, no issue was raised initially

that there was an original owner called Sawariel Fernando.

Long after the Plaintiff had concluded his case, it was only in the course of the 1st

Defendant's evidence that the issue pertaining to Sawariyal Fernando was raised.

It was the contention of the Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant that the 1st Defendant has

not established as to how the original owner Sawariyal Fernando became entided to

60/120 share. The learned District Judge has however stated in detail as to how the said

60/120 share devolved on the parties to this case-seepage 14 of the judgment which

appears on page 17 of the brief.

7 ~ ~~oo6tE:> 10/120

8 ~6) ~moo6tD 10/120

e%~f'D!:1)6tD 20/120" 6

According to the pedigree of the 1st Defendant, Sawariyal had 3 children namely Bastian,

Selesthina and Andrias, who all became entitled to l/6th share of the corpus each.

Bastian's Rights

Bastian died leaving two children namely Peduru and Ana and as Ana died unmarried and

issueless, her rights devolved on Peduru and according to the evidence given by the 1st

Defendant, Peduru died leaving Juse, Anthony and Maria and as Juse and Maria died

unmarried and issueless, their rights devolved on Anthonis and as Anothonis died leaving

his only heir his wife Juliana, she possessed the said rights and transferred them to the 1st

Defendant by deed No.20l2 and dated 26.07.19S4, which was produced marked 1~2.

Selestina's Rights

It transpired in evidence through Bastian that Sawariyal's daughter Selesthina's undivided

1/6th share devolved on Maria and Peduruand Peduru had a child called Ana Fernando who

had a child called Evfrashia and said Evfrashia's rights devolved on the Sth Defendant.

On a perusal of the birth certificate of the Sth Defendant produced marked sen, the Sth

Defendant'S mother was Evfrashia and in terms of the birth certificate produced marked as sen, her father was Bastian and upon a perusal of the birth certificate produced marked

S~3, Ana alias Albina's father was Peduru. Therefore the Sth Defendant has established his

devolution from Sawariyal to him.

The Plaintiff also admitted that Peduru had a child called Dona Maria whose rights have

devolved on the t h Defendant.

Dona Maria was entitled to undivided 112 share of Peduru's rights as the other half share

devolved on Ana and Albina. Thus it is clear that the evidence led in the case establishes

the th Defendant's rights.

Therefore Selesthina's 1/6th share devolved as undivided l/12th share each to th and Sth

Defendants.

7

Andria's Rights

As regards Sawariyal's other child namely Andrias, the Plaintiff too admitted the 1st

Defendant's pedigree to the effect that the said rights devolved on Poralosthina, Ewsethia,

Dusthina and Mercilina.

Poralesthina's rights devolved on Ananthasia and by deed produced marked oQ the said

rights had been transferred to the Plaintiff.

Ewsethia's rights devolved on Maria Nonis and in tum the said rights devolved on her two

children Lucia and Esebella and they transferred the said rights to the Plaintiff by deed

produced marked as PI.

As the tt Defendant in his evidence has stated, the said rights devolved on the Plaintiff

from the Andria's four children and the Court does not disbelieve this evidence.

The Plaintiff also became entitled to Dustina's rights which devolved on Ewsethia and she

transferred the same by olA to the Plaintiff.

The aforesaid Mercilina's rights too were transferred by ot3 to Ananthasia and the said

rights were transferred by her to the Plaintiff by P2. Therefore the Plaintiff became entitled

to the entire 1/6th share of Sawariyal's son Andriyas.

There was no dispute by the Plaintiff regarding the devolution of Sawariyal's entire rights

to the Plaintiff, tr, 1h, and 8th Defendants. This devolution has been established by both

oral and documentary evidence.

Plaintiff's Pedigree

According to the pedigree of the Plaintiff there were eight original owners who had

acquired prescriptive title to the corpus.

Issue No.l of the Plaintiff on page 106 of the brief brings out this fact .

The court cannot accept this issue as no original co~owner could acquire undivided shares

by way of prescription whereas the eight original owners themselves claimed to have had

undivided shares according to the plaint.

If one peruses the evidence given by the Plaintiff, it is crystal clear that the Plaintiff could

give satisfactory answers as regards her pedigree, she eventually accepted the pedigree of

the 1st Defendant.

In the judgment dated 04.07.2006, the learned District Judge of Kalutara has quite clearly

highlighted this at pages 4 and 5 of the judgment.

In the circumstances there was no requirement to ascertain as to how Sawariyal acquired

prescriptive title to the corpus as devolution of his rights for well over 50 years was clearly

established by proving devolution of his entire 60/120 share as aforesaid.

The 1st Defendant also established the following:~

9

.. i. Identity of the corpus without any dispute.

ii. There was no application by any of the parties to exclude any part of the corpus on

the ground of prescription or on a different pedigree.

iii. The most relevant title deeds and other documents including the birth certificates

too were submitted by the contesting parties.

iv. It is also an admission that cultivation and the improvements in the corpus should

be given to the parties as claimed by them before the court commissioner at the

preliminary survey.

Thus upon a careful consideration of the judgment dated 04.07.2000 having regard to the

evidence, it is quite clear that the learned District Judge of Kalutara has clearly analysed all

oral and documentary evidence and arrived at the right decision.

In the case of Pathmawathie v.Jayasekara (1997) 1 Sri LR page 248 the Court held thus:-

"It must always be remembered by judges that a system of civil law that prevails in our country is

confrontational and therefore the jurisdiction of the judge is circumscribed and limited to the

dispute presented to him for adjudication by the contesting parties."

In the case of ThUagaratnam v. Athpunathan and others (1996) 2 Sri LR 66 Ananda

Coomaraswamy,J. held as follows:-

"Although there is a duty cast on court to investigate title in a partition action, the court can do so

only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both documentary and

oral."

"Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the corpus for

them; otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and expect the Court to do their work and their

Attomeys-at-Law's work for them to get title to those shares in the corpus"

As the learned District Judge of Kalutara has given cogent reasons for his conclusions and

the issue raised on Kaitan Fernando's right namely Issue No.9 which was the focal point of

argument before this Court has been quite convinCingly answered having regard to the

evidence, the decision reached by him has been in accordance with the evidence led in the

10

.. . .

trial. In the circumstances I see no reason to disturb the findings of the learned District

Judge.

Accordingly I proceed to affirm the judgment dated 04.07.2006 and dismiss the appeal

with costs.
