Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Mahanama De Silva for the Petitioners.

Hashini Opatha, S.C., for the 1st Respondent.

Decided on: 10.06.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners who are parents of several students of Ashoka

College of Horana filed this application seeking to quash by way

of writ of certiorari the decision contained in P12 and to prohibit

by way of writ of prohibition implementation of the said decision.

If writ of certiorari is issued, writ if prohibition is redundant. By

P12, the 1st respondent, Secretary to the Ministry of Education,

informed the Manager of the said school to teach either in the

mother tongue (Sinhala/Tamil) or in bilingual medium in terms

of the Education Policy of the Government or face the

consequences.

Ashoka College of Horana is, admittedly, a Government

Approved Private Unaided School.

This decision, according to P12, is based on section 6 of the

Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Special Provisions) Act,

No.5 of 1960. That Act, as seen from section 2, makes

provisions applicable to Assisted Schools.

Section 6(1) of the said Act, so far as relevant to this application,

states that:

The proprietor of any school which, by virtue of an election

made under section 5, is an unaided school(a) shall

educate and train the pupils in such school in accordance

3

with the general educational policy of the Government [and]

(g) shall comply with the provisions of any written law

applicable to such school and matters relating to education.

Section 6, in my view, does not apply to all Unaided Schools. It

applies only to former Assisted Schools but later became

Unaided by virtue of an election made under section 5.

Section 5 allowed a proprietor of any Assisted School, by serving

a written notice on the Director of Education, to elect to

administer that school as an Unaided School.

The school under considerationAshoka College, Horanawas

not an Assisted School which became an Unaided School by

virtue of election under section 5 of the Act. It has been, from

the beginning, a Government Approved Private Unaided (English

Medium) School.

The predecessor to Ashoka College is Marshall Preparatory

School, which, according to the petitioners, has been founded in

late 1880s by a European lady by the name of Miss. Marshall.

Since then this Private School has been conducting classes in

English Medium.

Hence the decision contained in P12 is based on a wrong

premise and therefore bad in law. Section 6 of the Assisted

Schools and Training Colleges (Special Provisions) Act, No.5 of

1960 has no application to Ashoka College, Horana.

I quash P12 by writ of certiorari. Issuance of writ of prohibition

prohibiting implementation of the decision contained in P12 is

superfluous. However I formally issue writ of prohibition as

well.

Copious submissions were made about Education Policy of the

Government as section 6 of the Assisted Schools and Training

Colleges (Special Provisions) Act enjoins the proprietor of any

Assisted School, which, by virtue of an election made under

section 5, became an Unaided School, to educate and train the

pupils in such school in accordance with the General

Educational Policy of the Government.

As section 6 of the Assisted Schools and Training Colleges

(Special Provisions) Act is inapplicable to Ashoka College of

Horana, although it is not necessary for the present purposes to

consider the General Educational Policy of the Government, let

me add the following for completeness.

It is the position of the learned counsel for the petitioners that

the Government Policy in respect of the Medium of Instruction is

contained in the Education Ordinance, No.31 of 1939 and

Education Regulations 1951 made thereunder marked X1, and

according to them, there is no prohibition for a school like

Ashoka College, a Government Approved Private Unaided

School, to conduct classes from Grade 1 to 12 in English

Medium.

The learned counsel further submits that section 2 of the

National Education Commission Act, No. 19 of 1991, provides

for His Excellency the President to declare National Education

Policy, but no such Declaration has up to date been made, and

Education Policy of the Government shall therefore be

understood from the Education Ordinance and the Education

Regulations of 1951 made thereunder.

5

The learned State Counsel appearing for the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education, admits that no such Declaration for

National Education Policy has been made, but states that

Education Policy of the Government can be culled, if not

assumed, from the documents tendered to Court, and according

to those documents, a Private Unaided School such as the

Ashoka College cannot conduct classes purely in the English

Medium.

It is regrettable that the National Education Policy of the

Government is to be understood on assumptions in bits and

pieces from documents scattered everywhere, when the

Parliament passed the Law 28 years ago in 1991 to establish the

National Education Commission inter alia to recommend and

advice His Excellency the President to declare National

Educational Policy.

Section 2(1) of the National Education Commission Act, No. 19

of 1991, reads as follows:

The President, subject to the provisions of the Constitution,

may, declare from time to time the National Education

Policy which shall be conformed to by all authorities and

institutions responsible for education in all its aspects.

Section 2(3) of the Act reads as follows:

The National Education Policy shall be formulated on a

consideration of the recommendations and advice made to

the President by the National Education Commission

established by section 3.

6

It is distressing to note that we do not have a National

Educational Policy, which, in my view, shall be a top priority.

Circulars are issued by the Ministry of Education from time to

time by giving various directives to the authorities concerned, in

my view, without having a clear vision. By looking at circulars

of the Ministry marked P7A-P7C, it heartening to note that,

since recently, the Ministry has understood the importance of

changing the Medium of Instruction to English.

Competence in English is essential for personal success in

todays globalized world. English should not be the language of

the urban elite to downgrade otherwise talented rural youth. In

my view, it is hypocrisy to make it compulsory to the children of

underpriviledged to study in Sinhala or Tamil Medium, while

making it possible for the children of the elite and affluent to

study in English Medium at International Schools or overseas,

may be, to keep the distance.

I might also add that, International Schools have been operating

in a vacuum with no authority to regulate, manage or control by

the Ministry of Education. They are registered under the

Companies Act or as Board of Investment projects.

It is apt to quote the concluding remarks made by Professor

Rajiv Wijesinghe, who in 2001 served as a Consultant to the

Ministry of Education to initiate the reintroduction of English

medium education in the state sector, at a seminar on the

subject of Promoting English Medium Education, marked X

with the counter affidavit.1

English is no longer just the language of the British, a

legacy we could do without. Rather it is the principal

international language, one of increasing opportunities all

over the world. The comparative advantage we had with

regard to English has been sacrificed at the altar of a

divisive linguistic nationalism, which I fear has contributed

to our nation being deprived of a tool that could have helped

us immeasurable. While the privileged continued to benefit

from their possession of this tool, the vast majority of our

people, of all communities, had no access to it. We owe it to

them and to the nation as a whole to take all possible

steps, in the interests of equity as well as national

prosperity, to set right this sad situation.

Application of the petitioners is allowed. The 1st respondent, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education, shall pay each of the four

petitioners a sum of Rs. 100,000/= as costs of the action.

The Registrar is directed to send copies of this Judgment to the

Secretary of the Ministry of Education and the Chairman of the

National Education Commission.
