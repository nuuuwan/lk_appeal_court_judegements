Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Anuradhapura dated

06.07.2000.

The Plaintiff-Appellant filed the above styled action and sought a declaration that she is entitled

to possess the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint as the lawful lessee, an

order of eviction against the Defendant-Respondent and all those possessing under her, damages

and costs.

The learned District Judge entered judgment as prayed for in the plaint and hence this appeal.

The learned counsel for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) sought to assail the

judgment on four main grounds.

Res Judicata

The Appellant submits that in view of the previous decisions in D.C. Anuradhapura case no.

10964/L, Court of Appeal case no. CA 58/96(F) and D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 14802/L the

Plaintiff-Respondent (Respondent) cannot maintain the action on the doctrine of res judicata.

The learned District Judge held that this issue was answered in favour of the Respondent by his

predecessor by order dated 25.09.1996 and as such the Appellant is estopped from raising this

issue again.

There is doubt expressed by some jurists as to whether the doctrine of issue estoppel is covered

by Section 40 of the Evidence Ordinancel . It appears that the Law Reform Commission

recommended the amendment of Section 40 of the Evidence Ordinance by the addition of the

clause, "For the purpose of this section, "suit" includes the determination of a question in a

previously decided case" due to this reason.

However, the mere fact that Section 40 of the Evidence Ordinance does not provide for the

application of the doctrine of issue estoppel in not determinative of its application in our law. The

duty is cast upon this Court in terms of section 100 ofthe Evidence Ordinance to examine whether

issue estoppel is part of English Law of Evidence and if so to apply it.

In Thoday v. Thoday [(1964) 1 AII.E.R. 341, (1964) 2 W.L.R. 371, (1964) P. 181) Diplock L.J. stated

that if in a litigation on a cause of action, which can only be established by proving that two or

more different conditions are fulfilled, any issue whether a particular condition has been fulfilled

is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, either on evidence or on an admission by a

party, neither party can, in subsequent litigation between them on any cause of action, which

depends on the fulfillment of the identical condition, assert the opposite of what has been

determined in the first litigation - that the condition was fulfilled or not fulfilled, as the case may

be.

A more recent judicial exposition on the ambit of issue estoppel was made by Lord Keith in the

House of Lords in Arnold v. Notionol Westminster Bank pic [(1991) 2 A.C. 93) in a speech with

which all the House concurred. He stated (at page 105):

"issue may arise where a particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of

action has been litigated and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same

parties involving a different cause of action to which the same issue is relevant one of the

parties seeks to re-open that issue."

While the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys [(1976) 2 AII.E.R. 497)

held that issue estoppel does not apply in English criminal proceedings the House of Lords in Mills

v. Cooper [(1967) 2 Q.B. 459) held that the doctrine applies in civil cases.

The application of the doctrine in civil cases is essentially concerned with preventing abuse of

process. Accordingly, the decision of the House of Lords in Arnold v. Notional Westminster Bank

pic (supra) shows that there are circumstances when a party will be entitled to re-open an issue

which is covered by issue estoppel. Lord Keith of Kinkel, with whom all their Lordships agreed

said (supra at 109):

"In my opinion your Lordships should affirm it to be the law that there may be an

exception to issue estoppel in the special circumstance that there has become

available to a party further material relevant to the correct determination of a

point involved in the earlier proceedings, whether or not that point was specifically

raised and decided, being material which could not by reasonable diligence have

been adduced in those proceedings."

A similar approach is adopted in the decision ofthe Supreme Court of Canada in Penner v. Niagara

(Regional Police Authority Service Board) and Others [(2013) 2 SCR 125] in which Cromwell and

Karakatsanis JJ, delivering the majority judgment of the court, said at paragraph 29:

"The one [doctrine] relevant on this appeal is the doctrine of issue estoppel. It

balances judicial finality and economy and other considerations of fairness to the

parties. It holds that a party may not relitigate an issue that was finally decided in

prior judicial proceedings between the same parties or those who stand in their

place. However, even if these elements are present, the court retains discretion to

not apply issue estoppel when its application would work an injustice."

The following conditions must be fulfilled for the doctrine to apply2:

(i) Finality ofthe decision on the issue

(ii) The determination must be fundamental, not collateral

(iii) Identity of Parties

(iv) Same Capacity

(v) Precisely the same and identical issues or questions must have been decided

There is the further requirement that the particular issue should have been determined by a court

of competent jurisdiction (Supra at 468).

I hold that issue estoppel is part of English Law of Evidence in civil cases and in view of section

100 of the Evidence Ordinance it is part of our law in civil cases.

Issue no. 13 deals with the question of res judicata and the same issue was answered in favour of

the Respondent previously by order dated 25.09.1996. That order fulfils the conditions necessary

for the doctrine of issue estoppel to apply. Accordingly, I see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned District Judge on that issue.

However, the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that having accepted the issue on res

judicata as issue no. 13 it was not possible for the learned District Judge to have disregarded that

issue on the doctrine of issue estoppel.

I am not convinced on that point. In any event, the doctrine of res judicata has no application to

the facts of the case.

D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 10964/L was instituted by the husband of the Respondent

Kapuralalage Kiribanda as a possessory action. Judgment was entered in his favour in the District

Court. However, in appeal the Court of Appeal in case no. 59/86( F) set aside the judgment of the

District Court on the basis of prescription.

Section 40 of the Evidence Ordinance recognizes the doctrine of res judicata and the following

constituents must be present for it to apply3:

(i) The former action must have been a regular action

(ii) The two actions must have been between the same parties or their representatives in

interest (privies)

(iii) The previous decision must be what in law is deemed such

(iv) The particular judicial decision must have been in fact pronounced as alleged

(v) The previous judgment must be a final judgment

(vi) The same question or identical causes of action must have been involved in both

actions

(vii) The judicial tribunal pronouncing the decision must have had competent jurisdiction

in that behalf

(viii) The judgment should not have been obtained by fraud or collusion

(ix) If it is a foreign judgment, it should have been passed in accordance with the principles

of natural justice

D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 10964/L was a possessory action based on section 4 of the

Prescription Ordinance. In a possessory action the question of title is immaterial. As Gratiaen J.

held in Perera v. Perera (39 c.L.w. 100 at 101):

"The test to be applied with regard to proof of possession ut dominus is a subjective test,

and in possessory actions it is not appropriate to investigate title for the purpose of

deciding whether or not a party's claim to possession of land is justified in law. The

purpose of a possessory suit is not to adjudicate upon questions relating to title but to

give speedy relief to a person who, claiming to be owner of property in his own right has

been dispossessed otherwise than by process of law."

Wood Renton J. in Fernando v. Fernando (13 N.L.R. 164 at 165) held:

"For the purposes of such an action as section 4 of Ordinance No. 22 of 1871

contemplates, it is not necessary that the plaintiff should set out a title sufficient to

support an action rei vindicotio. He has to prove possession ut dominus, that is to say, as

the term has been defined by a Bench of three Judges in the recent case of Abdul Aseez v.

Abdul Rahiman [(1909) 1 Cur. L. R. 271.], he must have possessed not alieno nomine, but

with the intention of holding and dealing with the property as his own, whereas here, he

is a lessee for the full term of the lease"

However, in the present action the Respondent sought a declaration that she is entitled to possess

the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint as the lawful lessee. It is an action for

declaration of title. As the two causes of action are different the plea on the doctrine of res

judicata must fail on that ground alone.

Page 6 of 8

D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 14802/L was filed by the Respondent in relation to the same corpus

seeking a declaration that she is the lawful permit holder. To that extent the causes of action in

that and the present action are the same. However, the Respondent withdrew D.C. Anuradhapura

case no. 14802/L with liberty to file a fresh action subject to the payment of Rs. 1000/= as costs.

The previous case must be decided on the merits for the doctrine of res judicata to apply

[Annamaly Chetty v. Thornhill (34 N.L.R. 381)J. Hence D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 14802/L cannot

apply as res judicata to the present action.

Pre-Payment of Costs

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Respondent was given permission to

withdraw D.C. Anuradhapura case no. 14802/L with liberty to file fresh action on condition of a

pre-payment order for Rs. 1000/=. It was submitted that since the Respondent failed to do so this

action cannot be maintained. The Appellant relied on the decision in Scriven & Co. v. Perera (19

N.L.R. 503) where a plaintiff was allowed to withdraw an action with liberty to institute another

on condition that he paid the defendant his costs before instituting a fresh action and the court

held that the new action was not maintainable as the condition was not complied with.

The failure to make the pre-payment of costs was raised as a preliminary objection on 03.07.1996

and the learned District Judge rejected it on the basis that the pre-payment order did not specify

the time at which it must be made.

The same issue is raised again as issue no. 9 and the learned District Judge held that it was not

necessary to answer it on the doctrine of issue estoppel. I have earlier held that issue estoppel is

part of our law of evidence in civil cases. The order made on 03.07.1996 fulfills the requirements

necessary for the doctrine to apply in this case. Accordingly, I see no reason to interfere with the

conclusions of the learned District Judge on this issue.

Defects in the Permit

The Appellant contended that the permit granted to the Respondent was defective. However, it

is observed that no issue was raised on this matter at the trial. In any event, the learned District

Judge has carefully examined this issue and held that there is no such defect. I see no reason to

interfere with this conclusion.

List of Witnesses and Documents

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Respondent had failed to file a list of

witnesses. The learned District Judge has considered this matter and made order on 25.11.1996

allowing the Appellant to file a list of witnesses and documents. I see no error in the order made

by the learned District Judge.

For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
