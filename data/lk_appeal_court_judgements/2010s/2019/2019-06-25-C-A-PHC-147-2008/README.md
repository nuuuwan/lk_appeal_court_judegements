Decided on: 25.06.2.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this action against a number of parties as

respondents in the Magistrate's Court under section 66(1)(b) of the

Primary Courts' Procedure Act seeking restoration of possession on

the basis that, within two months prior to the filing of the action,

the said respondents forcibly entered into possession of the land in

suit, which the petitioners had been in possession. The

respondents denied it. After inquiry concluded by way of written

submissions, the learned Magistrate dismissed the application of

the petitioners. Being dissatisfied with this order, the petitioners

went before the High Court, and the High Court set aside that

order and directed the learned Magistrate to make a fresh order

having properly considered the material placed before him. It is

against this Judgment of the High Court, some of the respondents

have filed this appeal before this Court.

3

The learned Magistrate has dismissed the petitioners' case on two

grounds: (a) there was no threat to the breach of the peace and (b)

case has been filed two months after the alleged dispossession.

The High Court has decided that the learned Magistrate erred on

both points.

The learned Magistrate has accepted that the fourth petitioner has

made two complaints to the police regarding forcible entry, in that,

the first one was on 24.10.2004, and other one, on 13.12.2004.

According to the petitioners, the forcible entry has taken place on

23.10.2004. The learned Magistrate has taken the view that the

second complaint has been made in order to file this action.

Accordingly, he has held that there was no threat to the breach of

the peace.

The learned Magistrate has further stated that notwithstanding the

alleged dispossession has taken place on 23.10.2004, the case has

been filed on 11.01.2005, i.e. more than two months after the said

dispossession. This is a gross misdirection of the most material

fact as the case has in fact been filed on 21.11.2004 and not on

11.01.2005, the latter date being the notice returnable date.

Then the finding of the learned Magistrate that the second

complaint was made to the police on 13.12.2004 for the purpose of

filing this action is also erroneous. That complaint has been made

between the filing of the case and notice returnable date.

It appears that the learned Magistrate has hurriedly prepared the

order without making a proper analysis of the facts presented

before him.

4

Setting aside that order by the High Court in revision and directing

the learned Magistrate to deliver the order afresh in such

circumstances are correct.

Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
