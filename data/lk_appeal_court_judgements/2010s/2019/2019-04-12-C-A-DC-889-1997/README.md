Written Submission filed on : 1st Plaintiff-Appellant - 30.01.2019 2nd Plaintiff-Appellant - 22.02.2019 Defendant-Respondent 07.01.2019 Decided on : 04.04.2019

M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellants filed this action against the

Defendant-Respondents, praying inter alia (according to their amended

plaint dated 08.06.1987, vide page 48-51 of the appeal brief) for a

declaration for the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint and

for damages against the Defendant-Respondents (Respondents).

In the District Court, the Appellants took up the position in

their plaint that the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint

belonged to Narangoda Paraleiyyawanaramaya and that the Chief

Incumbent (the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant) and the Dayaka Committee

transferred the said land to the 2nd Plaintiff-Appellant.

3

Whilst, the Respondents filed their answer and pleaded that

the land described in the schedule to their answer is Kirikanawatte

Owita and that their predecessors in title have been in possession of

the land for more than 50 years and that by a Deed bearing No. 4566

dated 10.12.1861 (1V1) rights of this land had been transferred to the

two predecessors in title of both the Respondents.

Having heard both parties, the learned District Judge fixed

the case for trial on 11 issues (vide page 68 of the appeal brief). After

conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge delivered the

judgement on 13.03.1997 dismissing the Plaintiff-Appellants action,

however, granting the cross claim of the Respondents. Being dissatisfied

with the said judgment the Plaintiff-Appellants preferred this appeal to

set aside the judgment dated 13.03.1997 and grant reliefs sought as per

their amended plaint.

In this appeal, Counsel for the Respondents submitted that,

at the trial the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant gave evidence and stated that inter

alia, he had not obtained the Chief-Incumbent of Narangoda

Paraleiyyawanaramaya and that it was Rev. Siri Niwasa was the Chief

Incumbent at one time and that after his demise, the chief incumbent is

Rev. Sarantissa and that according to such disclosures the plaint is partly

incorrect. He further submitted that this fact had been admitted by the

deceased 1st Plaintiff-Appellant during his cross examination. Therefore,

it was the position of the Respondents that the averments on the plaint

are erroneous. Also it was another submission of the Respondent that,

4

for asking a declaration for the land in suit, the Appellants did not

tendered a single paper title on the land.

It is seen from the case proceedings that the Licensed

Surveyor C. K. Beddewela who gave evidence with respect to Plan No.

85/7 dated 30.09.1985 admitted in cross examination that when

superimposing lot No. 113 of the land shown by the Appellants and the

Respondents, he could not find any marking on the land. Although the

Surveyor stated that the superimposition is correct, and he admitted

that there are few dissimilarities with respect to the North, East and

South boundaries (vide page 85 & 86).

In these circumstances, this Court observed that the

learned District Judge carefully analysed the oral and documentary

evidence placed before him and held that the Appellants have failed to

prove that they have any dominium and control of property of the land

in suit.

It is trite law that who seeking a declaration (or dominium)

of a property, has a duty to prove of his own title, to a decree in his

favour for the recovery of the property and for the ejectment of the

person in wrongful occupation. (Vide R. W. Pathirana Vs. R. E. De. S.

Jayasundara [58 NLR 169]).

5

In the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the learned District

Judge correctly held with the Respondents. Therefore, I do not wish to

interfere with the judgment dated 13.03.1997.

Accordingly, I dismiss this appeal without Cost.

Appeal dismissed.
