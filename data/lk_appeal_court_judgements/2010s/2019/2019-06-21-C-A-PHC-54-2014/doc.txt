Decided on: 21.06.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed an application in the High Court seeking to

compel the respondents to implement the orders of the Public

Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council contained

in X7 and X10 by writ of mandamus. X7 relates to the

assumption of duties of the petitioner in his new post and X10

to the unpaid salary. According to the proceedings of the High

Court dated 18.09.2013 (at page 56 of the brief), the petitioner

has dropped the claim on X7 and confined his relief only to X10.

The learned High Court Judge by Judgment dated 23.05.2014

has refused to grant that relief. It is against that Judgment, the

petitioner has filed this appeal.

By X10 dated 26.10.2010 (at page 91 of the brief), the Secretary

of the Public Service Commission of the Central Provincial

Council has informed the Secretary of the Provincial Ministry of

Health to pay the petitioner his salary. It is common ground

that this is to the period between 10.03.2008-28.01.2009,

during which the petitioner did not report for work without prior

approval. Thereafter the Secretary of the Provincial Ministry of

Health by R11 dated 27.06.2011 (at page 116 of the brief) has

3

sought further instructions from the Secretary of the Public

Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council regarding

payment of salary during that period. In reply, the same

Secretary of the Public Service Commission of the Central

Provincial Council, who issued X10, has, by R9 dated

08.07.2011 (at page 114 of the brief), informed the Secretary of

the Provincial Ministry of Health not to pay the salary during the

period which the petitioner abstained from work without prior

approval. This has been informed to the petitioner by the

Secretary of the Provincial Ministry of Health by X12 dated

20.07.2011 (at page 92 of the brief). The petitioner does not

challenge R9, nor has he made the Secretary of the Public

Service Commission of the Central Provincial Council a party to

the application. In the circumstances I cannot understand why

and how the petitioner files this application seeking the Court to

force the respondents to implement the decision in X10. There

is no basis for this application.

The mandamus sought is clearly misconceived in law. Appeal is

dismissed with costs.
