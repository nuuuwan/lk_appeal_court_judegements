Harsha Zosa, PC with A. Premalingam for Defendant-Appellants

Rohan Sahabandu, PC with Hasitha Amarasinghe for Plaintiff~ Respondents

27.08.2018

The Plaintifr Respondents instituted this action on 02.01.1986 seeking a declaration

of title to land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the

Defendant-Appellants and those holding under them and damages in a sum of RS.25 from

November 1984 till they are placed in possession. The 2nd schedule described a land and

its contents in an extent of 1 rood and 35 perches. Though this cause of action was one

based on a licensor-licensee relationship, the pt and 2nd Plaintiffs (two sisters) set out a

devolution of title and narrated as to how they permitted their brother (a Grama Sevaka)

to occupy the land. They averred that their mother Sisilyahamy who became the owner

of the land described in the schedule transferred for consideration two divided portions

to them. The pt Plaintiff was conveyed by a Deed bearing No.12040 (P3) a divided extent

of 40 perches, whilst the 2nd Plaintiff was given a divided extent of 35 perches by a Deed

bearing No.12041 (P4). B(i~h deeds of sale were executed on 24.09.1962.

2

Somewhere in 1965 their hrother/the pt Defendant's husband came to Badulla as a Grama

Sevaka and as he did not liave a house of his own, the Plaintiffs averred that they let him

into possession of the land described in the schedule to the plaint.

With the passing away of the brother on 16.08.1984, the Plaintiffs alleged that their sister

in law (the pt Defendant) along with her children (2nd dnd yd Defendants) disputed the

title of the Plaintiffs and it was in those circumstances that the Plaintiffs sought a

declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint and the ejectment

of the Defendants among ql:her things.

The answer filed by the Defendants dated 19.12.1986 denied any leave and licence and

stated that R.B. Dissanavake/the husband of the pt Defendant and the father of the 2nd

> and yd Defendants enten~d the land in 1965 and possessed the land and house therein

without acknowledgement of any right in anyone and thus had prescribed to the land.

As the said R.B. Dissanayake passed away in 1984, his prescription would inure to them

as they were the legal heiril. of Dissanayake.

The answer also had an alternative claim in that the Defendants claimed a sum of

Rs.100,000 as compensation for the construction of a house and improvements on the

land. This was claimed in the answer as an alternative to title by prescription in the event

title is decided in favour Df the Plaintiffs. Thus the answer prayed for a dismissal of the

plaintiff's action and compensation in a sum of Rs.100,OOO/ <.

Leave and licence on th~ part of the Plaintiffs and prescription by their brother

Dissanayake from 1965 to 1984 were raised principally as issues and the trial took off on

I 26.09.1988 with Sisiliyahamy/the mother of the Plaintiffs and the mother in law of the pt

Defendant beginning to give evidence for the Plaintiffs.

The question before this Court was whether the pt Defendant's husband was a licensee

of the Plaintiffs as the Plaintiffs alleged or he had prescribed to the land in his own right

as the Defendants allegedtThe evidence that unfolded in the case unmistakably drives

one to conclude that R.B Dissanayake was a licensee in 1965 and not someone who

independently entered the land as the answer averred It had to be remembered that the

3

Plaintiffs became the owners of the land on 24.09.1962 and the mother of the Plaintiffs

and R.B. Dissanayake (the husband of the pt Defendant and the father of the 2nd and yd

Defendants) testified that it was with the leave and licence of the Plaintiffs he was let

into possession of the land and the house thereon. This leave and licence were given until

he constructed a house on his own land which was adjacent to the land in question. Even

the 1st Defendant in hel' testimony testified that not only her mother in law

(Sisiliyahamy) but also the sisters in law (the Plaintiffs) gave them possession to occupy

the house which stood on the land, because they did not have a house when her husband

came on transfer to BaduHa. This evidence confirming the fact that the Plaintiffs gave her

husband to live in the house establishes the fact that the plaintiffs" issue was proved-

namely the husband of th'l pt Defendant was a licenser of the Plaintiffs. In other words

the husband of the pt Def~Tldant was given a habitatio of the house by the Plaintiffs. , -

The pt Defendant contradicts her own issut about the year of their entry into the land.

Whilst her issue asserted that it was 1965, she testified that it was in 1968. The plaintiffs'

version was that the perrpissive entry was in 1965. In view of the inconsistency per se in

the pt defendant's case, it: has to be taken that it was in 1965 that leave and licence and

habitatio were granted.

'I It is trite law that whenp6ssession commences on a dependent title, it continues in the

same breath until the Defendant shows a change in causa. If the possession of a Defendant

is contractual, the percipient judgment of U. de Z. Gunawardana, J. in Ruberu and

Another v. Wijesooriya(1998) 1 Sri LR 58 becomes pertinent. The learned judge opined

that a licensee obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it upon terms that he will not

dispute the title of the Plaintiff without whose permission he would not have got it. The

effect of Section 116 of th~Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee decides to challenge

the title under which he ,is in occupation, he must first quit the land. The fact that the

licensee obtained possession from the Plaintiff is perforce an admission of the fact that

the title resides in the Plaintiff.

4

But here were the Defendants who sought a dismissal of the plaint by pleading a superior

title of prescription of thei~~ privy/R.B. Dissanayake. In other words their case was that

R.B. Dissanayake's permissive possession turned adverse. In my view though U. de Z.

Gunawardana,j. stated that a defendant is estopped from pleading his own title vis a vis

his licensor, he was indeed referring to an acquisition of a paper title on the part of a

licensee. If the licensee acquired a paper title, it is only then that he has to surrender

possession and litigate to vindicate his title. As the 1st Defendant pleaded prescription on

the part of her husband in;this case, it is open to the 1st Defendant to plead and establish

l it in the same case, as Section 3 of the Prescription Ordnance would permit a defendant

to take that defence.

Be that as it may, there must be an overt act on the part of the pt Defendant's husband

that manifests an intention to oust the Plaintiffs and the question arises whether the

Defendants have established adverse possession on the part of their privy. It was

contended that the adversity began in 1970 when plans for a construction of a new house

were submitted. The pt Ddendant no doubt stated that her husband R.B. Dissanayake

spent his money and constructed the house. It must beremembered that there stood on

the land an old house in which an uncle of the Plaintiffs and R.B. Dissanayake had been , . staying, This was the house that R.B.Senanayake/the husband of the house was given the

leave and licence to occupy. In other words his sisters (the Plaintiffs) gave him habitatio

of the house.

Initially, it was the eviden:,;e of the pt Defendant that her husband effected repairs to the

old house as it was inhabitable. Later on she testified that her husband constructed a

new house.

In terms of VI/the permission that was granted for a construction of a new house, the

house must be built of bricks and the roof must be covered with zinc. But on a totality of

evidence it is apparent that the roof contained old tiles which were not the prevalent

commodity of tiles availahte at the time of the trial. This shows that there never c;::ame up

on the land a new house. The learned District Judge of Badulla has observed the

deportment and demeanor of the pt Defendant and concludes that the pt Defendant's

5

testimony does not pass the test of credibility. If one leoks at the report of the surveyor

(Xl), one sees a reference to a floor of a house which had been paved with cow-dung clay

and not cement. The surveyor had observed this in 1987 and this evidence goes contrary

to the assertion of the 1st Defendant that her husband had built a new house. These items

of evidence of only sho\\; the existence of an old house, and I take the view that the

learned District Judge o(I,aho was quite right when he concluded that only rep.airs had

been effected to the old house and no new house had c\)me up at all.

It has to be remembered that the repairs had in fact bcen effected with the permission

from the Plaintiffs and their mother. No doubt water supply as evidenced by a document

marked as V5, had been taken after the institution of the action in the District Court. All

other documents marked 'i.S V4, V6 and V7have been considered by the learned District

, Judge and these documen!s evidencing receipts do not specify the exact amount spent

for the purpose of supply t)f electricity. ,',

The evidence of the maSOIl-Piyadasa was that the construction charges would be around

Rs.65,000i-. But Issue No.13 specified a sum of Rs.lOO,OOOi- and I cannot fault the learned

District Judge for taking the view that the alternative claim of Rs.lOO,OOO/- as

compensation has not bee}"} established.

Upon a careful perusal of &'le totality of the evidence, I find that there was no new house

that had come up on the land but rather the old house that stood on the land had been

renovated. There was thus no adverse possession that had supervened and the husband

of the 1st Defendant had continued to possess the land on a dependent title of the

Plaintiffs from 1965 till he died in 1984. If at all, a change in causa (manifest intention to

possess the land ut dominu;i or ouster) must be shown to have begun from an identifiable

event which excluded the&,laintiffs and there is no proof of the identifiable event, which

has been credibly established-see Chelliah v Wijcnathan 54 N.LR 337 at 342;

Sirajudeen and others v., Abbas (1994) 2 Sri LR 365 klr insistence on the starting point

for prescription. There is then no proof of a starting point which signals an uninterrupted

and undisturbed possession for 10 years prior to the bringing of the action.

6

'T

What is put forward as the beginning of adverse possession is a purported construction

, . of a house in 1970 which does not bear scrutiny having regard to the evidence placed at

the trial. The creditworthir:ess of the witnesses has been assessed by the learned District

Judge who had the advantage of seeing and listening to the witnesses and this Court will

be slow to disturb the findings to facts of primary decision maker in the circumstances/

see Fradd v Brown 20 N.L.R 282; PaweD v Streathem Manor Nursing House 1935 AC

243; Munasinghe v Vidanage69 N.L.R 97: Natt v Tholnas 19471 All ER 582;Jinarathne

Thera v Piyaratne Thera (1982) 1 Sri LR 273; (1993) 1 Sri.LR 332

In the circumstances, the permissive possession of R.B. Dissanayake had continued till

1984 when he crossed the great divide and that permissive permission will not give rise

to the claim of prescriptive possession made by the Defendants. The action was filed in

1986. Though prescription claimed by the Defendant/Appellants did not originate from

their privy R.B.Senanayake because his possession has always been permissive at the

instance of the Plaintiffs, there is another principle that was intrinsically interwoven

with the leave and licence granted to R.B.Dissanayake namely habitatio t

Habitatio

Thus, the case of prescriptive title put forward by the Defendant/Appellants fails on a

consideration of the facts and the case of the Defendant is unsustainable. Let me observe

that the leave and licence given to R.B.Dissanayake would be tantamount to habitatio. I

do have to allude to this Roman Law concept as it was contended that there was no

evidence of due terminatictl of the licence given to the Defendants, and hence this action

could not be maintained/see Ahriff v Razik (1985) 1 Sri.LR 162; Attanayake v

Ramyawathie (2003) 1 SrLLR 401 at 409. The necessIty to terminate any licence does

not arise at all, in view of the fact that the licence given to R.B.Dissanayake the privy of

the Defendants terminated upon his death. His death ipso facto terminated the licence as

it was personal to him and this licence was not transmissible to the defendants upon the

death of R.B.Dissanayake." 'J

Maintainability of the Action~ Plea of Misjoinder

Both in the oral argument and written submissions, it was the contention on behalf of

the Defendant~Appellants that this action jojntly by the two sisters should fail for

misjoinder of parties and causes of action. It was averred in the plaint that out of the land

described in the second schedule the first Plaintiff was entitled to a divided extent of

forty perches and the second Plaintiff was entitled t) a divided extent of thirty five

perches. In other words d~:e first Plaintiff has no rights in the divided thirty five perches

belonging to the second Plaintiff and the second Plaintiff has no rights in the forty

perches belonging to the first Plaintiff. In other wo~ds both Plaintiffs do not have

undivided rights in the total extent of 1 Rood and 35 Perches (75 perches) and cannot

therefore be together declared entitled to the entirety of the seventy five perches. It

therefore follows that the two Plaintiffs are not entitled to the property in equal shares.

'( i There is no common ownership to the land and therefore they cannot join in one plaint

1( the principal relief prayed for~namely that the first and second Defendants be declared

entitled to the land in the second schedule~cannot be \Sfanted and therefore the action

will have to be dismissed. The two Plaintiffs specifically have their divided rights in

separate entities. In the :.-ircumstances there is no proof of title pleaded by them~see

Loku Menika and OtheI:', v Gunasekare (1997) 2 Sri.LR 281; Dharmadasa v Jayasena

l ,1997) 3 Sri.LR 327. ThiE..'lplea is tantamount to misjoinder of Plaintiffs and causes of

action.

I have to interpose at this stage and recall that this objection to misjoinder of parties and

causes of action was taken only in the course of the trial on 15.05.1989 when th~ learned

Counsel for the Defendants upon the aforesaid basis raised issues No 15 and 16 stating

that the action could not he maintained as there was ;1. misjoinder of parties and causes

of action. These issues w'':1'e indeed raised as preliminary issues of law, but the learned

District Judge by his order dated 29.05.1992 overruleri the said preliminary issues and

held that the action could be maintained.

The tenor of the learned District Judge's reasonjng was that the Defendants had claimed

prescriptive title to the whole land described in the schedule to the answer, which of

8

'(

..

course mentioned a slightly different extent. In other words when the defendants

claimed both lands as one unit in the answer and raisedprescriptive title to that one unit,

they disregarded the infirmity in the plaint namely there is a misjoinder of the plaintiffs

and causes of action. By their plea of prescriptive title to the entire land, they had

disregarded misjoinder-so inferred the learned District Judge. Accordingly the learned

District Judge held that the action could continue. The wisdom of the learned District

Judge is not to be disregarded so slightly. Sometimes wisdom cries out in the wilderness.

Though the learned District Judge held that the action could continue, I read the

conclusion as equivalent to a statement that one plea of the defendants (misjoinder taken

half way through the tri~,l) is defeated by another plea of the theirs -i.e they had

prescribed to the entire land as one unit though they were divided portions.

I would not pronounce on the validity of the inferences that flow from the conclusion of

the learned District Judge as his answer is quite moot but I take the view that the plea of

misjoinder that was raised far too belatedly. It is axiomatic that misjoinder should not

be taken either in the answer or at a posterior stage of the trial as it was taken in this

trial. Section 17 of the CPC is quite categorical that no action shall be defeated by reason

of the misjoinder or nonjowder of parties and there is no provision in the Code to dismiss

an action on the ground of misjoinder of causes of action-See Ranasinghe v Fernando

69 N.LR 115. The very objection that the learned Presi~ent's Counsel for the Defendant

Appellants took before this court as to the maintainability of the action was dealt with

in the case of Madar Saiho vs. Sirajudeen 17 N.LR 19 wherein it was held that joinder

by two persons in one action of claims in respect of separate lands to which each is

separately entitled is obrtoxious to section 17 of the Civil Procedure Code, but the

irregularity may be waived by the defendant-see Pereira J.

So the Defendants must be taken to have waived misjoinder when they went to trial

without having raised it at an anterior point of time before the answer.

"In order to properly understand the rule we must look at the whole of it. It begins by

saying "No cause or mattq: shall be defeated by reasons of the misjoinder or non-joinder

9

r

of parties." - that is the key to the whole question If the court cannot decide the

question without the presence of other parties, the cause is not to be defeated, but the

parties are to be added so as to put the proper parties before the Court". Per Lindley LJ.

in Moser vs. Marsden~(l958) 2 W.LR 725.

So the objection as to the maintainability of the action fails before this Court and for the

foregoing reasons I have set out on the facts and law engulfed in this case, I would

proceed to affirm the judgl~ment dated 04.10.1996 and dismiss the appeal.
