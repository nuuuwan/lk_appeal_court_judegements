Parties agreed that the application can be disposed by way of written submissions.

The Petitioner is a duly incorporated company in Sri Lanka and earlier 90% of its shares were held

by Ceylinco Finance Ltd. (presently known as Nation Lanka Finances PLC) a member of the

Ceylinco Group of Companies. The Petitioner states that with the collapse of some of the

companies of the Ceylinco Group there was a run on the public deposits in the Petitioner

company. It is further submitted that the Central Bank moved to protect the depositors of the

Petitioner and issued several circulars to that end.

The 1st Respondent was an executive director of the Petitioner when it was part of the Ceylinco

Group during which time he apparently received a monthly salary of Rs. 532,000/= in addition to

various perks inclusive of a BMW car. The Petitioner states that it was subject to the directions

of the Central Bank which have been marked P1(a) to P1(n).

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the decision contained in order/letters

marked P8(a) and P8(b). It is an order made by the 2nd Respondent under section 68(1) read with

53(3) of the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment & Remuneration) Act as

amended (Act) by which the Petitioner was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 62,34,720/= to the pt

Respondent for the period February to May 2009 and November 2009 to January 2011. The

burden of establishing that P8(a) and P8(b) should be quashed on the basis of illegality,

irrationality or procedural impropriety is on the Petitioner.

The Petitioner seeks to assail P8(a) and P8(b) on two grounds. Firstly, that the said order is ultra

vires the powers of the 2nd and 4th Respondents and secondly that it is wrong in law as it violates

the directives issued by the 5th Respondent.

Section 53(3) of the Act reads:

"(3) Where an employee has not been paid the whole or a part of the remuneration

required by this Act to be paid to him by his employer, the Commissioner may, if he thinks

fit so to do, by written notice require the employer to pay such amount or the balance of

such amount to the Commissioner within the time specified in the notice so that the

Page 3 of 8

Commissioner may remit it to such employee. Where the employer when served with

such notice pays such amount or such balance directly to such employee instead of

transmitting it to the Commissioner as required by such notice, he shall be deemed not

to have paid such amount or such balance to such employee."

The Petitioner has not sought to argue that the 2nd or 4th Respondents did not have the power

under the Act to make the impugned orders. Hence the first ground must necessarily fail.

The Petitioners main submission is found in the second ground namely that in view of the

directions of the Central Bank which have been marked P1{a) to P1{n), the 2nd and 4th

Respondents did not have the power to make the impugned orders.

Upon a closer examination of the directions marked P1{a) to P1{n}, it is clear that P1{b}, P1{c},

P1{e}, P1{f}, P1{g}, P1{i}, P1{k) and P1{I) do not deal with emoluments/remunerations of a director

of the Petitioner company. P1{m) and P1{n) are dated 04.03.2011 and 08.03.2011 respectively

and hence irrelevant to the issue of the emoluments/remunerations of the pt Respondent until

January 2011 when the services of the 1st Respondent was terminated. Only P1{a}, P1{d}, P1{h)

and P1(j) deals with the emoluments/remunerations of a director of the Petitioner. P1{d) directs

the Petitioner not to make payments without the prior written approval of the Board and hence

is irrelevant to the issue before Court as the position of the Petitioner is that they cannot pay the

Petitioner in view of the directions and not that the Board did not approve payments. P1(j) is also

irrelevant as it withdrew P1{d) and P1{h) with effect from 31.03.2011.

Therefore, this Court has to consider only whether either P1{a) or P1{h) was validly made and

prevents the Petitioner from making the emoluments/remunerations claimed by the pt

Respondent.

There is no duty to refer to the provisions of the law under which an order is made, provided that

the law grants the authority the power to make the said order [Pieris v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (65 N.loR.457), Seneviratne v. Urban Council, Kegal/e (2001) 3 Sri loR. 105)], However, it

was incumbent on the Petitioner or the 5th Respondent to state at least in their pleadings or in

the written submissions the relevant statutory provision under which the impugned orders P1{a)

and P1{h) were made.

Though the Petitioner has not in the petition sought to explain how the said directions

supersedes the provisions in the Act in the written submissions it is submitted that the directive

Pl(a) was issued under and in terms ofthe Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 (Finance Business

Act) and therefore the Petitioner was bound to comply with it [paragraph 31 of the written

submissions filed on 12.03.2019]. It is addressed to the then Chairman of the Petitioner company

and requires him to limit the current emoluments/remunerations of every director of the

company who receives emoluments/remunerations exceeding Rs. 200,000/= per month to a

maximum of Rs. 200,000/= per month until the liquidity position of the company improves to a

satisfactory level. Pl(a) is dated 06.02.2009 whereas the Finance Business Act became law on the

11th November 2011. Clearly Pl(a) was not issued under the Finance Business Act as claimed by

the Petitioner.

The 5th Respondent in the objections has not specified the relevant law under which directions

Pl(a) and Pl(h) was made. Instead it has referred to several laws such as the Monetary Law Act

No. 58 of 1949 as amended, Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988,

Finance Business Act and the Finance Leasing Act No. 56 of 2000. No written submissions were

filed on behalf of the 5th Respondent. This conduct clearly indicates that the 5th Respondent is

seeking to justify its orders by referring to several laws without specifying the relevant provision

under which it is made. This Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery looking at each and every

provision of the laws referred to in order to ascertain whether the impugned orders are intra

vires or not. Therefore, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the part dealing with

limiting the remuneration/emoluments of the directors in Pl(a) and Pl(h) has been validly made

and is binding on the Petitioner.

The learned counsel for the p t Respondent has further submitted that the Petitioner has

suppressed and/or misrepresented material facts and as such this application should be

dismissed in limine without going into merits. This submission is based on the failure of the

Petitioner to disclose letter dated 14th January 2011 (lR2) sent by the Director, Department of

Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions to the then CEO of the Petitioner by which it was

informed that the unpaid approved allowances for 10 months of the Petitioner should be

resolved in conformity with the directions issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the relevant

Page 5 of 8

employment contract, prevailing company policies relating to employees/directors and

applicable labour rules. Clearly it appears that the Central Bank was of the view that the

directions themselves are not determinative of the issue of unpaid allowances and that the

relevant employment contract and applicable labour rules must also be considered. This was a

material fact which should have been disclosed.

It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without going into the merits

if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts. It is necessary in this

context to refer to the following passage from the judgment of Pathirana J in W. S. Alphonso

Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [77 N.L.R. 131 at 135,6]:

liThe necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the

Court when, an application for a writ or injunction, is made and the process of the Court

is invoked is laid down in the case of the King v. The General Commissioner for the

Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmorbd

de Poigns Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated are

applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing

with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had

suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of Appeal

affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material

facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of

prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the

necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go

into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination".

Page 6 of 8

This principle has been consistently applied by courts in writ applications as well. [Hulangamuwa

v. Siriwardena [{1986} 1 SrLL.R.275], Collettes Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour [{1989} 2 SrLL.R.

6], Laub v. Attorney General [{1995} 2 SrLL.R. 88], Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Wilfred Van Els

[{1997} 1 SrLL.R. 360], Jaysinghe v. The National Institute of Fisheries [{2002} 1 SrLL.R. 277] and

Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore Dharmasiriwardene & Others [{2007} 1 SrLL.R.

24].

In fact, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others [{2005} 1

SrLL.R. 67] this Court held that if there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the

Court would not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination.

The Petitioner may well be able to contend that it disclosed the letter dated 12th January 2011

[P1{k}] which is somewhat of the same tenor as 1R2 but with a broader application. However, it

is to be observed that the Petitioner has merely annexed it as part of a bundle of directions made

by the Central Bank to the petition without drawing the specific attention of Court to its

construction or to the material parts of it. In this context the following pronouncement of

Sirimane J. in Athula Ratnayake v. Jayasinghe {78 N.L.R. 35 at 39-40} is instructive:

"Learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner did not intend to

suppress that fact as the copy of the summing up was filed with the petition. This indeed

is meaningless and should have never been done. His petition though it refers to

documents {A} to {J} filed with the petition makes no reference whatever to the summing

up also being filed. If any documents are filed with the petition, they must be referred to

in the petition itself as this Court would be led by the contents of the petition and

affidavit. On reading the papers filed I myself was under the impression that the summing

up had not been supplied to the petitioner at all. This type of non-disclosure in the

petition and the filing of the document without it being referred to in the petition, tends

to create in the mind of the Court a wrong impression and at the same time affords the

petitioner, when his bona fides are questioned, to point out as an excuse that the

Page 7 of 8

document was in fact filed with the petition. The filing of such a document without any

reference to it in the petition, is, as I said earlier, "meaningless and only meant to give

the petitioner an excuse after having misled the Court into a wrong belief. This type of

action must be viewed with strong disapproval and one hopes that it would not be

followed in future." (Emphasis added)

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there is no illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety

in the orders marked P8(a) and P8(b). In any event the Petitioner has suppressed and/or

misrepresented material facts from Court and the application is liable to be dismissed in limine

without going into the merits.

The application is dismissed with costs.
