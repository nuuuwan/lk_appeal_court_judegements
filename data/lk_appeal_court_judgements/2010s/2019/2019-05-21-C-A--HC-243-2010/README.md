ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an appeal by the appellant, against his conviction for murder

and sentence of death. He was convicted by the High Court of Ratnapura

after trial without a jury for committing the murder of one Edirisinghe

Mudiyanselage Chandana Somasiri on or about 24.03.2003 at Noragolla.

The prosecution case was that the appellant, who was the 2nd

husband of the mother of the eye witness to the incident, Jayalath Menike,

came in the evening at about 7.00 p.m. to the house where the deceased

(her brother) lived. Jayalath Menike, having visited her brother that evening

had met her other sister who also came to see the deceased, with her

2

husband Sisira at their brother's place. The appellant had arrived there at

that time with two others. The appellant had found fault with the deceased

over an unspecified issue. In the process he also threatened that he would

kill his wife, the mother of the deceased, who was staying with,him at that

time. Seeing Sisira, the appellant wanted to know the reason of his

presence at the house of the deceased at that time. Sisira replied that had

nothing to do with the appellant's problem. The appellant responded to

Sisira's said remark with an attempt to assault him. At that point of time

the deceased sought to intervene but was stabbed in the chest by the

appellant. The deceased, who had no weapon with him at any point of

time, never said anything to the appellant or had at least made an attempt

to do anything to challenge him, even though he was verbally abused by

the appellant,

The medical evidence reveals that the necessarily fatal stab injury

suffered by the deceased had penetrated into the chest cavity through

intercostal space and caused a piercing injury to the ventricle of his heart.

At the hearing of his appeal, learned Counsel for the appellant

sought to challenge the said conviction on the basis that the trial Court had

erroneously denied the appellant of the benefit of lesser culpability on the

basis of sudden fight, when it found him guilty to murder. Learned

Counsel relied heavily on the evidence of the police officer who made

scene observations to impress upon this Court that there was in fact a

3

sudden fight and it was during that fight the deceased was stabbed by the

appellant.

In the judgment of Kumarashighe v The State 77 N.L.R. 217 of the

Court of Criminal Appeat it was held by H.N.G. Fernando CJ that the effect

of a plea of sudden fight 1/... is that the accused is guilty only of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder, despite the fact that he did entertain a

murderous intention."

Apparently, in view of the reasoning contained in the judgment of

Farook v Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 174, learned Counsel for the

appellant did not challenge the trial Court's determination on murderous

lintention entertained by the appellant at the time of inflicting one stab

injury to the deceased which proved to be a necessarily fatal injury.

Instead, she sought to bring the case against the appellant within the scope

of Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code by placing reliance on the

police observation that there was a "sudden fight".

The Supreme Court, in its judgment of Bandara v Attoney General

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 55, laid down the conditions that should be satisfied if an

accused were to receive the benefit from the plea of sudden fight. Dr.

Bandaranayake CJ states in her judgment that;

u ... in order to come within the Exception 4 of Section 294

of our Penal Code, it is necessary to satisfy the specific

requisites referred to in Section 294 of the Penal Code, viz;

4

1. it was a sudden fight;

2. there was no premeditation;

3. the act was committed in a heat of passion; and

4. the assailant had not taken any undue

advantage or acted in a cruel manner. II

Having identified these requisites, the apex Court added further that

when a deceased was unarmed and did not cause any injury to the

appellant, the appellant following a sudden quarrel had inflicted fatal

injuries to the deceased, that the Exception 4 to Section 294 would not

apply. The process of reasoning adopted by the Court in coming to such a

determination, is explained as the Court observes that;

" the lapse of time may grant the opportunity for an

accused to premeditate and make arguments for a fight.

Such a fight is not spontaneous and therefore cannot be

regarded as one that could be described as sudden. If there

was a lapse of time between incidents prior to the final

assault, it is quite clear that the heat of passion upon the

quarrel would have subsided and the death on such an

instance would be regarded as a murder."

This Court, in an unreported judgment of Gemunutileka v Han.

Attorney General, CA No. 131/2000 - decided on 10.09.2008 - adopted the

same approach as it observed that;

5

" testimony neither bears out there was an

exchange of words between the appellant and the

deceased nor that the deceased attacked or attempted to

attack the deceased. The balance of probability tilts in "

favour of prosecution that it was more likely that the

appellant took advantage of the situation and with

deliberate design attacked the deceased with a deadly

weapon."

In these circumstances, their Lordships have held that "there is no

evidence to suggest that the appellant acted in a heat of passion generated by the

alleged sudden fight."

The trial Court, in its impugned judgment, has considered the

evidence presented before it and decided that the appellant is not entitled

to the benefit of the Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

This Court concurs with the conclusion reached by the trial Court on

this issue. The appellant did not cross examine the eye witness on the basis

that there was a sudden fight. Witness Jayalath Menike was cross examined

on the basis that it was to Sisira that the appellant made an attempt

initially. It was her evidence that after the act of stabbing, she grappled '

with the appellant to wrest his knife out of his hand and the appellant, in

6

the process, bit her hand. She intervened to disarm the appellant at that

point as he has threatened that he would kill her mother as well.

It is obvious that the appellant targeted the deceased as he was

responsible in providing shelter to his estranged wife. The appellant first

verbally abused the deceased in the presence of his two companions and

then made an attempt to initiate a quarrel with Sisira. Sisira avoided any

interaction with the appellant. The Appellant then made an attempt to

assault Sisira. It is at that point of time the unarmed deceased made an

attempt to intervene, perhaps to save his brother- in- law from stabbing. It

is at that juncture that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant. Clearly

the evidence points to clear case of premeditation and negates any

inference that the " .. . appellant acted in a heat of passion generated by the

alleged sudden fight."

Learned Counsel for the appellant heavily relied on the observations

made by the Police officer at the scene of crime that he saw several foot

prints on the front garden, outside the entrance to the deceased's house. In

his evidence, the witness stated that there may have been some movement

by several people or even a scuffle, judging by the disturbance of soil. He

clarified, upon being questioned by Court that what he saw was the signs

of few people hanging around (3)lC)a~) 6)@o~C))). The police officer's

inconclusive observations cannot supplement for the absence of any direct

evidence that there was a scuffle, especially when there is evidence to the

contrary.

7

Having considered the submissions of the learned Counsel, against

the evidence placed before the trial Court, we are of the view that the

conclusion reached over the issue of sudden fight by the Court was correct.

Therefore, we hold that the appeal of the appellant is without merit and

ought to be dismissed for that reason.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant

by the trial Court is hereby affirmed and his appeal stands dismissed.
