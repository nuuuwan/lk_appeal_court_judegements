Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner employer filed this application seeking to quash the

arbitration award marked P2 made in favour of the 5th respondent

employee by writ of certiorari. By this award, the arbitrator, after

inquiry, ordered to make the employee permanent in his

employment as a Fire Extinguishing Officer from the year 2005

and make the due payments.

The employee has particularly relied on the public administration

circulars 27/2001 marked P7 and 13/2005 marked R9 in seeking

reliefs.

The learned counsel for the employer, before this Court, challenges

this award on several grounds.

The first one is that the said circulars are inapplicable to the

employer, which is the Ceylon Electricity Board. This argument is

unacceptable. The Ceylon Electricity Board is a Government-

owned Corporation, and the said circulars, on the face of them,

expressly state that they are also applicable to Government

Corporations.

The next argument, which is the principal argument, is, as there

was no vacancy for the post which the employee sought to be made

permanent, and also there was no existing scheme of recruitment,

those circulars are inapplicable. This argument has been rejected

by the arbitrator.

According to the circulars, inter alia, there shall be vacancies to the

post in the permanent cadre and the employee shall also fulfil the

requirements in the scheme of recruitment.

The witness for the employer Ceylon Electricity Board has stated in

evidence at the inquiry that there was an approved cadre for four

Fire Extinguishing Officers in 2011 and 2012. The argument of

the learned counsel for the employer is that according to the

circulars there should have been approved vacancies at the

material time, which means in 2005, and not in 2011. The

arbitrator in the award has adverted to this aspect, but considered

the other relevant documents including P19 to come to the

conclusion that there was a vacancy at the material time although

such a vacancy was not created. That is due to indifference or

disinterestedness on the part of the employer Ceylon Electricity

Board and not due to any fault on the part of the employee. The

employee was recruited as a Fire Extinguishing Officer on contract

basis in the year 2000 and he discharged his duties in that

capacity to the satisfaction of the employer.

I need hardly emphasize that, according to section 17(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, as amended, When an

industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1)(d) or section

4(1) to an arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, he shall make all

such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, hear

such evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and

thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and

equitable. In that process, the arbitrator need not follow the rigid

rules of law. Vide Brown & Company PLC v. Minister of Labour

[2011] 1 Sri LR 305, Asian Hotels & Properties PLC v. Benjamin

[2013] 1 Sri LR 407.

In United Engineering Workers Union v. Devanayagam (1967) 69

NLR 289, the Privy Council stated: The powers and duties of an

4

arbitrator under the Industrial Disputes Act, of an Industrial Court

and of a Labour Tribunal on a reference of an industrial dispute are

the same. In relation to an arbitration, the arbitrator must hear the

evidence tendered by the parties. So must a Labour Tribunal on a

reference. An Industrial Court has to hear such evidence as it

considers necessary. In each case the award has to be one which

appears to the arbitrator, the Labour Tribunal or the Industrial Court

just and equitable. No other criterion is laid down. They are given an

unfettered discretion to do what they think is right and fair.

I do not think, in the facts and circumstances of this cases, the

award of the arbitrator is perverse. There is no an error of law on

the face of the record.

The final submission of learned counsel for the employer is that

the arbitrator violated the principles of natural justice in that the

arbitrator did not consider when making the award all the

documents marked by the employer at the inquiry. However the

learned counsel does not point out a single document which the

arbitrator has failed to consider and which is in his favour.

I see no reason to interfere with the arbitration award. Application

of the employer to quash the said award by certiorari is refused

but without costs.
