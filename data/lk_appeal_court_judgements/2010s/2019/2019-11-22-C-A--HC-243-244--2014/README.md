HON. ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st and 3rd accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

appellant and the 2nd appellant respectively), by their individual petitions

of appeal addressed to this Court, seek its intervention to have their

convictions, for the counts of conspiracy to commit murder and

committing murder of lndragotabhaya Samarawickrama on or about

19.06.2003 at 21 post - Suriya-ara, and the consequent imposition of

sentences of death, set aside.

In the indictment presented to the High Court of Monaragala by the

Hon. Attorney General, there were three persons accused of the two

aforementioned offences. All the accused have elected to be tried without a

2

jury. At the conclusion of the ensuing trial, the trial Court had acquitted

the 2nd accused and convicted only the 1" and 3rd accused to the

indictment, who are referred above as the 1st and 2nd appellants.

The prosecution heavily relied on the only "eye witness's" account

of the incident, led through witness Ajith Kodagoda (PW1), in support of the

allegations of conspiracy and murder. In addition, it had led evidence to

establish that the deceased had sustained two stab injuries penetrating

into his chest cavity causing damage to blood vessels and lungs, leading to

haemorrhagic shock resulting in his death.

In support of their respective appeals, learned Counsel for the 1"

and 2nd appellants have made extensive submissions on the common

ground of appeal that the trial Court had failed to properly evaluate the

evidence of the solitary eye witness which they challenge as being

"unreliable", and thereby the Court arrived at an erroneous conclusion as

to their guilt.

It is the evidence of the sole eye witness that he spent the night at

the 1st appellant's house (one of his distant relatives) after watching

television till late night. The 2nd appellant, whom the witness knew from

his childhood, was also there. He woke up in the early hours of the

following morning at about 4.30 a.m. due to the sound of an alarm. The

witness, having noted the front door of the house was left open, had

looked for the appellants. He saw two of them were going in the direction

where the body of the deceased was later discovered. The two appellants

were dressed in an ordinary clothing at that time. His curiosity forced him

to follow them. He avoided walking along the public road in following

3

them in order to prevent his discovery and had cautiously kept a distance

of about 200 feet in between them.

At some point, the two appellants were met by another two persons

who were waiting on the Thanamalwila main road. This was near a hut

where the Army had set up a check point in the recent past. The l si

appellant, an army deserter, was clad in an army uniform by this time. The

l si appellant had thereafter stopped two motor cyclists who happened to

go pass them and allowed the cyclists to proceed after checking them. The

third motor cyclist who was stopped by the lsi appellant was the deceased.

Having identified the motor cyclist by referring to him as "@1l51ll ~ 0l8",

the gang of four had then surrounded the deceased and attacked him with

clubs. He then fell off from the motor cycle. The witness then saw the

deceased being stabbed by the l si appellant about thrice on his chest, when

he was appeared to be seated on the road. The witness claimed that he

could not bear to witness this attack on the deceased any longer and had

returned to the l si appellant's home and slept. After the daybreak, they

were told by a fellow villager that someone was lying by the road. All

three went to see the place where the body of the deceased was. On their

way the 1st appellant admitted that it was his work and warned the

wih1ess not to divulge about this to anyone. After their arrival at the scene,

the witness saw his cap and the electric torch he had brought with him in

the previous night, on his way to 1st appellant's house, were lying near the

body of the deceased.

Then they returned to the lsi appellant's house and parted their

ways. The witness had thereafter proceeded to a chena in Pallebedde. The

Police came in search of him to Pallebedde having already "arrested" his

4

father. He was assaulted by the Police while questioning the whereabouts

of the 1st appellant. The witness had divulged where the 1st appellant was

hiding. He was arrested by the Police in the same day.

In his examination in chief itself the witness stated that he had

iden tified two more persons, namely" Rumesh" and "Chandu ", as the two

other persons who also assaulted the deceased with clubs. But he also

stated before the High Court that he did so only upon instructions of the

Police. He did not know them until their introduction to him by the Police.

Only one of them was indicted before the High Court along with the two

appellants, named therein as the 2nd accused.

The witness was cross-examined by all three accused and have

suggested to him that he had accused the 1st and 2nd appellants to this

murder after he was severely assaulted by the Police, forcing him to falsely

implicate them. In addition, there were two inconsistencies marked off his

statement to Police as 1 VI and 1 V2. The witness admitted having making

another inconsistent statement in of his testimony during the inquest

proceedings, which ran contrary to the position he had taken up in the

High Court. There were few omissions that were highlighted by the

appellants over both important and some peripheral matters during the

cross-examination of this witness.

It is the collective submissions of the learned Counsel for the two

appellants that these inconsistencies and infirmities have made the

testimony of the sole eye witness for the prosecution highly unreliable and

it would be dangerous to act on such evidence without any corroboration.

They submit there was none. It is also their contention that the trial Court

5

had dealt with the important inconsistencies that were highlighted by

them only superficially and the failure of the trial Court in this aspect had

tainted the validity of the conclusion it had eventually reached.

The 1st appellant, in support of his appeal strongly contended that

the inconsistencies marked as lVl and lV2 throws serious doubts about

the alleged complicity of him in the murder since the wih1ess was

obviously inconsistent as to who was in army uniform at the time of the

attack on the deceased.

It was the evidence of this witness before the High Court that it was

the 1st appellant who was in army uniform, stopped the motor cyclists and

then stabbed the third one. However, in his statement to Police, which was

made after six days since the incident, he claimed that it was one of the

two who were seen on the road awaiting the arrival of the two appellants

that night. The inconsistency that was highlighted by the 1st appellant is

in relation to his evidence before the trial Court and the position advanced

by the wib1ess during inquest proceedings. This inconsistency was

admitted by the witness which excluded any mistake made by the witness

on his claim.

It was also highlighted by the appellants that there was no motive

for the appellants to mount such an attack on the deceased. In addressing

the issue of lack of corroboration, it was emphasised that although the

witness alleged that the deceased was clubbed by the gang of four, the

post mortem report did not support such a claim as it was clear that the

deceased had suffered only two stab injuries to the back of his chest. It

was submitted by the appellant that the absence of contusions or

6

lacerations on the body of the deceased is not supportive of the fact that

there were assaults by blunt weapons and therefore a doubt arises as to

the reliability of the version of the events presented by prosecution.

The appellants also contended that the witness made a statement

only after he was severely assaulted by the Police and the trial Court had

failed to evaluate credibility of the evidence of this solitalY eye witness

from the angle of that very relevant consideration.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his reply submissions stated

that the trial Court had properly evaluated the evidence and particularly

the two inconsistencies and found that it would not affect the credibility of

the witness as it was not important. He also submitted that the subsequent

conduct by the appellants clearly supports the allegation of the

prosecution that it was they who committed the murder.

It would appear from the contention of both the appellants that their

main thrust in challenging the conviction is based on the credibility of the

sole eye witness Ajith Kodagoda. The trial Court, for the reasons stated in its

judgment, concluded that the said witness is a truthful and reliable

witness.

The challenge mounted by the appellants therefore concerns a

determination of a question of fact by the trial Court. Credibility of a

witness is undoubtedly a question of fact and the determination of that

question of fact by the trial Court, which had the opportunity to note the

demeanour and deportment of such a witness, is obviously is entitled to

great weight; vide judgment of the Supreme Court in Attorney General v

Man} Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292.

7

In this particular instance, the trial Court, in accepting Ajith Kodagoda

as a credible witness, had placed reliance of the demeanour of the said

wibless in coming to this conclusion. In such a situation this Court must

then consider, even if it entertains a different view to the one held by the

trial Court about the credibility of a witness, whether it should interfere

upon such a determination.

In Sumanasena v Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 137, the

contention of the appellant before this Court was the credibility of the

solitary wibless who made an incriminating statement against him only

after about a month since the incident. The appellant therefore contended

the witness had ample opportunity to fabricate a version. This Court

having noted the following, proceeded to dismiss the said appeal.

In relation to the claim that the conviction is based only on the

evidence of a solitary wibless this Court observed;

"In our law of evidence the salutary principle is enunciated

that evidence must not be counted, but weighed and the

evidence of a single solitary witness if cogent and impressive

could be acted upon by a Court of law. Section 134 of the

Evidence Ordinance sets out that "no particular number of

witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any

fact". In an Indian case the conviction for murder was

affirmed on the mere circumstantial evidence given by a

solitary witness and a pointed reference was made to the

principle which we have adumbrated above vide Mulluwa v.

The State of Maddhya Pradesh. Testimony must always

be weighed and not counted and these principles have been 8

followed by justice G. P. A. Oe Silva in Walimunige John

v. State; King v. N. A, Fernando."

Similar view was adopted by this Court in Sarathchandra & Others

v Republic of Sri Lanka (2005) 2 Sri L.R. 267.

In the context of the acceptance of the evidence of a solitary witness

by a trial Court, another related issue would be the consideration whether

such evidence should be corroborated or not as a pre condition enabling

the trial Court to place reliance on it thereafter if it is the case. Particularly

the 2nd appellant contended that the evidence of the sole eye witness was

not corroborated and therefore said evidence ought to be considered as

unreliable. This too apparently is not an absolute requirement that would

be applied universally and automatically. The evidence of a virtual

complainant need not be corroborated by the evidence of a decoy as per

the judgments of Gunasekera v The Attorney General 79(1) N.L.R. 348 and

Sunil v Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 191. However, Gunasekera v The

Attorney General, the then Supreme Court recognized the principle that a

trial Court could act on uncorroborated testimony of a complainant

provided that the h'ial Court found it to be "cogent and convincing".

As already noted, in the instant appeal, the trial Court has decided

to accept the evidence of the sole eye witness despite its proved

inconsistencies in 1 VI and 1 V2, coupled with other infirmities that were

highlighted. The trial Court decided to accept his evidence attributing

these infirmities to mere lapses in memory. The witness Kodagoda has

given evidence before the learned trial Judge who delivered the judgment.

Therefore, learned trial Judge has had the opportunity of observing

9

demeanour and deportment of the wihless and had in fact stated so in the

judgment in coming to the conclusion that the said wih1ess is a truthful

and reliable wih1ess.

In Ariyadasa v Attorney General (2012) 1 Sri L.R. 84 it was re-

emphasised in consideration of several judicial precedents on the point

that;

"Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a trial

Judge with regard to the acceptance or rejection of a

testimony of a witness, unless it is manifestly wrong, when

the trial Judge has taken such a decision after observing the

demeanour and deportment of a witness."

This pronouncement reflects the general approach the Court of

Appeal would adopt when presented with the challenge to a decision by

the trial Court to accept a wih1ess as a credible wi mess. The appellate

Courts would not interfere, unless such a decision is "manifestly wrong".

In delivering the judgment of Wijeratne v Attorney General (1998) 3 Sri

L.R. 98, this Court has decided to allow the appeal before it, in following

the judicial precedents laid down in the judgments of King v Gunaratne 14

CL.R. 174 and Fernando v Inspector of Police, Minuwangoda 46 N.L.R.

210.

In King v Gunaratne, it was held that the following three tests

would apply in such circumstances;

"1. Was the verdict of the Judge unreasonably against the

weight of the evidence?

10

2. Was there a misdirection either on law or evidence ?

3. Has the Court of trial drawn the wrong inferences

from matters in evidence ?"

The judgment of Fernando v Inspector of Police, Minuwangoda

adopted the view that;

n . an appellate Court is not absolved from the duty of testing

the evidence extrinsically as well as intrinsically although the

decision of the Magistrate on question of fact based on

demeanour and credibility of a witness carries great weight.

Where a close examination of the evidence raises a strong doubt

as to the guilt of the accused, he should be given the bweji t of

the doubt."

Similar approach was adopted by this Court as indicative in the

judgments of Jagathsena and Others v Perera and Others (1982) 1 Sri L.R.

371 and Kumara de Silva and Others v Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R.

169. In the Supreme Court judgment of Dharmadasa v Director General,

Commission to Investigate Bribery or COYnlption and Another (2003) 1 Sri

L.R. 64.

Thus, in the light of these judgments, this Court should venture to

consider the evidence of the solitary witness for its truthfulness and

reliability by adopting the universally accepted tests in evaluation of the

11

testimonial trustworthiness of a witness, in order to satisfy itself as to the

validity of the conclusion reached by the trial Court on this issue.

In relation to the test of spontaneity, it must be noted that the

witness made his statement to Police only after six days from the date of

incident. With the incident, he had relocated himself to a chena in Pallebedde

area. The Police came in search of him after" arresting" his father who

apparently led them to the said location. The witness's father had been

assaulted by the Police probably to extract information to ascertain

whereabouts of the witness. The witness too was assaulted by the Police

while questioning him about the 1st appellant. The witness made his

statement to the Police only on 25.06.2003 at 6.40 p.m. after his arrest and

whilst being kept in the Police lockup. During cross examination of the 2nd

appellant, the witness admitted that he was released soon after he made

the said statement and he was allowed to go home.

Although, the prosecution led evidence as to the reason for the delay

in making statement, it did not elicit material as to why the witness was

reluctant to make a statement to the Police. The witness, in his evidence

stated to trial Court that he had told what he saw that morning to his

mother and also to one Ukkun Mama in detail before he left for Pallebedda.

This shows that the witness had no fear of divulging the role played by the

1st appellant in the murder to others, even though he claims that he was

threatened. But no explanation was forthcoming as to why he was

reluctant to make a statement to Police. Similarly, there was no valid

explanation by the witness as to why he had to find employment in a

chena of Pallebedda at that particular point of time.

12

When the conduct of the witness is considered in the light of the

evidence that had been led before the trial Court in relation to the recovery

of the cap and an electric torch which belonged to him from the crime

scene, it is reasonable to assume that he had to offer an acceptable

explanation for that particular find to the Police. It appears that the witness

opted to implicate the 1st appellant for the stabbing while naming the 2nd

appellant and two other unknown participants and thereby distancing

himself from the crime. He claims that he saw the attack on the deceased

whilst hiding some unspecified distance away from the attackers, under

the cover of the shrub jungle. But he offers no explanation as to how and

why his cap and torch was found by the Police near the body of the

deceased. The appellants have suggested that the appellants were falsely

implicated by the witness due to duress, which the witness had simply

denied.

This particular suggestion by the appellant could not be ignored

since the witness himself admitted before the trial Court that he identified

the 2nd accused and the 4th accused (who was not indicted) at the non-

summery inquiry simply because the Police introduced the two persons as

the other two who the wihless had claimed to have seen that morning

during the attack on the deceased. The 4th person was left out by the

prosecution from the trial before the High Court.

It could be that the two appellants had some complicity in the

murder of the deceased. But it was incumbent upon the prosecution to

prove that fact by presenting legally relevant, admissible and reliable

evidence before the trial Court. In the absence of any explanation as to the

presence of the personal belongings of the witness Kodagoda at the crime 13

scene it is highly questionable as to the validity of the decision taken by the

Police to treat him as the "sole eye witness" rather than an accomplice. The

prosecution could have still utilised the statement of the witness by

making a recommendation to the Hon. Attorney General for granting a

pardon under Section 256(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, in

order to secure conviction of the real perpetrators of the crime. It is clear

that the Police already looking for the 1st appellant when they arrested the

witness. The witness, who claims that he was severely assaulted by Police,

was released from custody immediately after he made a statement

incriminating the appellants. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to

consider the proposition that the Police may have coerced the witness tried

to implicate the 1st appellant, an army deserter, who was involved in the

illegal calU1abis hade in the area and by making Kodagoda a wihless when

it should have treated him as an accomplice?

In these circumstances, the testimony of the said wihless becomes

somewhat compromised when scrutinised under the test of spontaneity.

Then evaluating the testimony of the said witness by applying the

test of consistency and inconsistency, the appellants have highlighted three

significant inconsistencies. The 1 Vl and 1 V2 are the marked contradictions

and in addition, the witness admitted giving evidence during the inquest

proceedings contrary to his position taken at the trial Court.

It is the position of the witness that the 1st appellant, who was

wearing a pair of shorts, when he initially saw him walking with the 2nd

appellant that early morning, was clad in an army uniform soon after. He

had not seen at which point of time the change of clothing took place. He

14

had witnessed them from a distance and the person in uniform also

wearing a cap. It is also his testimony the 1st appellant, who was in

uniform had repeatedly stabbed the deceased.

However, going by his statement that was made aiter six days from

the incident and presumably his memory was still fresh, the witness was

emphatic that the person in army uniform was one of the other two

unknown assailants who were waiting for the appellants on the main road

that morning. This reference could not be a mistake made by the witness

because he had repeated that position once more in his statement. Then,

after few days since making the statement and during inquest proceedings

he had reiterated a similar position.

The contradiction that had been marked as IVI is as follows:

"~@cl Olll 00 ) "gCl) ClClol g~<3J@O~ @<;@<;@lllol O)@O -WallllCl). -Wal 001

g~<3J@@ool q)~ g.iD@t'lf ~cnol<; q.iDoI g~<3J@O) cn@ooI oro /;)<;DOCl ocnol ql<; G<3Jlll 80lllCl)"

Similarly, the contradiction 1 V2 reads thus:

"-Wal og .. )Oom), q~@ qBo)oI ~ clO)lll@O 80 ro~<;) qzG ql<; @lll)<3JoI g~<3J@O) 6 qo@ 0)0 Cloo qzOi lllG /;<; G<;O <3Jeg Cl@O ~Cl)

The witness admitted he said in evidence at inquest proceedings that:

"q)~ g.iD@t'lf ocnol qZ<;@<3Jlll rooO) Oio@) <dolcn). 6 @Cl@)@Cl

-Wallll OIG~" OiO@l Cl~al 0i5Cl)<;?"

When the impugned judgment is perused it is clear that the trial

Court had only considered the inconsistencies marked as 1 VI and 1 V2.

15

Unfortunately, the other inconsistency that had been admitted by the

witness, had escaped the attention of the trial Court. Due to that oversight

the said vital inconsistency was excluded from the process of evaluation in

applying the test of consistency.

It appears that the trial Court, having considered 1V1 and 1V2, was

of the opinion that it does not affect to the "core" (coco) of his evidence.

TIlis Court holds a different view and is of the opinion that the nature of

the inconsistency could not be ignored in that way as it in fact affects a

core issue that had to be decided by the trial Court.

Why this inconsistency is considered as important by this Court

could be explained on several postulations. It is correct that the witnesses'

implication of the 1st appellant as the person who stabbed the deceased is

consistent. However, in describing the role played by the other two, the

witness was making inconsistent statements. The inconsistency as to who

was in the uniform and as such the determination of the issue whether it

was the 1st appellant who stabbed the deceased in the way described by

the witness becomes a questionable asqertion.

The Prosecution need not prove a motive on the part of the

appellants. However, the evidence indicates that whoever who committed

the murder certainly had a strong motive against the deceased for it is

clear that the assailants have consciously selected their victim after a

proper identification. The prosecution did not elicit exact details from the

wibless as to the role played by the other appellant and two unknown

persons. It appears from the evidence presented by the prosecution that it

16

was the 1" appellant who took the lead role in the entire episode while the

other three were merely acted as his acolytes.

However, the position as revealed from the inconsistencies, indicate

a different picture. The inconsistencies show that it was one of the two

persons who were waiting for the appellants to arrive at the scene, took the

initiative to stop the motor cycles and identifying the cyclists and thereby,

shifting the act of identification of the victim from the 1st appellant. It is

also the evidence that the 1st appellant had stabbed the deceased

repeatedly (about thrice) on his own without waiting for anyone to issue

instructions.

Other than causing his death, his assailants have not engaged in any

other offence as his motor cycle and the personal belongings were left

untouched until the Police arrived at the scene. Whoever who caused the

death of the deceased therefore merely intended to cause the death of their

victim without making a mistake in identifying him. This strongly

suggestive of a pre-existing plan coupled with a strong motive but such

evidence is not available.

The most important factor that affects the evidence of the witness in

view of these inconsistencies, is his claim of identifying the persons who

were involved in the incident. The witness stated in the trial Court that the

1st appellant was in army uniform and wore a cap. It is evident that he

witnessed the incident from some unspecified distance away from the

scene. The place where the motor cycle stopped was cleared of any

vegetation owing to the check point manned by the army. It is therefore

safe to assume that there was a considerable distance between the witness

17

I I

and the lsI appellant who was dressed in a uniform wearing a cap. There

was no light available except for the moon and the witness claimed he

identified the lsI appellant thorough that light.

According to the witness, the l sI appellant was clad In a pair of

shorts only a while ago. He then reappeared in a uniform with a cap and

the witness saw this being some distance away. The identification of the

lsI appellant was made by the witness only upon moon light. The only way

he could identify the 1st appellant is facial identification. But it is

doubtful whether there was sufficient light shone on his face due to the

cap. Adding to this shaky identification of the 1st appellant is the

inconsistency as to who was 111 the army uniform that night. This

confusion, further exacerbated by the fact that an army uniform was

recovered upon the information provided by the 2nd accused in a cluster of

tall grass, which was located close to the house of the l sI appellant. The

witness specifically claimed in evidence before the trial Court that he

identified the 2nd accused upon being told to do so by the Police. However,

the 2nd accused was later acquitted by the trial Court.

Clearly the wihless was confused as to who was in the uniform that

night. The contents of his statements marked as 1 VI and 1 V2 calmot be

considered by a Court as substantive evidence but the inconsistent

position revealed therein ought to be given serious thought.

The confusion of the witness over the identity of the person in army

uniform renders his evidence, which attributed several acts of violence to

the said person in uniform, unreliable if not making it disqualified by due

to falsity of his version.

18

Adding to the failure of the trial Court to consider this particular

inconsistency it appears that the Court also overlooked to consider an

important omission highlighted by the 1st appellant.

This was in relation to the witnesses' claim that when they set off to

the place where the deceased was killed in the morning after its discovery

by a fellow villager, the 1st appellant admitted that it was his work and

threatened the witness not to divulge it to anyone. The 1st appellant had

invited attention of the trial Court that the witness had failed to make any

such reference in his statement to the Police. He had stated so only in the

evidence before the trial Court for the first time after a lapse of 11 years.

Unfortunately, the trial Court had considered this item of evidence in its

judgment as an instance of admitting culpability by the 1st appellant and

had thereafter proceeded to impute criminal liability on him relying upon

the said "admission", not realising that it had escaped from its mind to

consider the reliability of it in the light of the said omission. This is a

significant error on the part of the trial Court in its evaluation of evidence.

Moving to consider the evidence of the witness under the test of

probability, it must be noted that the evidence of the father of the deceased

revealed that this was the first time the deceased had decided to travel to

the institution where he studied, in newly acquired possession, the

unregistered motor cycle. He left home that morning at about 4.30 and

after about 5 hours the news reached him that the deceased was dead. The

deceased had no known enemies.

This poses a question as to how could the appellants, who were not

known to the family of the deceased, accurately predict that the deceased

19

would travel in a motor cycle that morning at that time in that particular

direction. The fact that the two other motor cyclists who have arrived at

the "check point" manned by the appellants were allowed to go indicate

that they knew who there were looking for. This is clearly a mismatch in

the prosecution version.

The deceased who was studying at the time of his death would not

have anyway interacted with the 1st appellant or involved in his illegal

trade in cannabis to earn his wrath, to be killed in this manner. The only

other possible explanation of a mistaken identity is clearly negated by the

witness's claim of clear identification of the rider by the 1st appellant.

Moving to consider another aspect of the witness's evidence on

probability, it is noted that the two penetrating stab injuries observed on

the back of the chest of the deceased was directed upwards. The witness

claimed the deceased was in a seated position when he received them. The

prosecution clarified the relative position of the attacker to the deceased

only through the medical witness but did not clarify the manner in which

these two injuries were inflicted through the solitary eye witness. When

the witness claim that the deceased was stabbed whilst in a seated

position, that claim seemed an improbable one due to its inherent

improbability. If the witness is right, then the person who stabbed the

deceased should inflict the injuries, whilst positioning himself to a lower

elevation than to that of the deceased. But he was seated on the road after

his fall from the motor cycle due to the clubbing by the gang of four. If the

stabbing did not take place the way the witness had described then that

might lead to a doubt whether the wih1ess had really saw the attack and

even if he did, whether he observed and recalled it correctly.

20

"

The lack of any telltale sign of blunt trauma on the body of the

deceased when the witness claimed he was assaulted by clubs is also

very significant. The Police found broken club at the scene.

When these infirmities are considered in the light of the

considerations already stated III this judgment and especially the

allegation that the appellants were implicated at the behest of the Police, it

is the opinion of this Court that the evidence of the witness becomes highly

unreliable owing to those infirmities. If he is an accomplice to the crime

then it is equally probable that he would "". cast his erstwhile association

and friends to the wolves in order to save his own skin" - per Illangatilaka &

others v Republic of Sri Lanka (1984) 2 Sri. L.R. 38. This proposition is

further fortified by the admission made by the witness that he identified

the 2nd and 4th accused during the non-summery proceedings simply

because he was instructed to do so by the Police. Then the question arises

whether that admission is in line with the contention of the appellants that

they too were falsely implicated upon the insistence of the Police. That

consideration should have been considered by the trial Court with due

regard to its effect on the evidence of this witness.

In view of these considerations, this Court concludes that the

evidence of the sole eye witness is clearly tainted with definite

disqualification of unreliability even if it is presumed that he was telling

the truth. This Court is of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove

its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The Supreme Court, in The Attorney General v Theresa (supra),

stated that" credibility is a question of fact, not law". As such it was further

stated:

" ... appellate Court should not ordinarily interfere with the

trial Court's opinion as to the credibility of a witness as the

trial Judge alone knows the demeanour of the witness; he

alone can appreciate the manner in which the questions are

answered, whether with honest candour or with doubtful

plausibility and whether after a careful thought or with

reckless glibness and he alone can form a reliable opinion as

to whether the witness has emerged with credit from cross

examination."

In the instant appeal, the trial Court was certainly not faulted for any

"reckless glibness" on its part but, in the opinion of this Court, had fallen

into error in its failure to engage in a careful examination of certain vital

infirmities, which in the opinion of this Court are sufficient to raise a

reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellants, to which they should

have been given the benefit of.

The contention that the subsequent conduct of the appellants is

supportive of their guilt, as submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General, is a questionable one. The avoidance of law enforcement is

common to the appellants and prosecution witness. Both parties have left

their village and found refuge in distant locations. At most this conduct

22

raises suspicion as to complicity of the appellants to the murder but, that

suspicion is inadequate to substantiate the evidence which clearly lacks

the attributes of "cogent and convincing evidence" per Gunasekera v

Attorney General (supra).

The convictions and the sentences of the appellants are therefore set

aside. The appeals of the 1st accused-appellant and the 3rd accused-

appellant are accordingly allowed.
