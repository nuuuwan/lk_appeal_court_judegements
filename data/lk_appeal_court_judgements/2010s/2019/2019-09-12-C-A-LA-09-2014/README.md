Decided on: 11.09.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Design Consortium Limited filed the appeal CALA/8/2014

against the determination dated 31.10.2014 of the

Compensation Tribunal set up under the provisions of the

Revival of Underperforming Enterprises or Underutilized Assets

3

Act, No. 43 of 2011 (which has now been repealed by Act No. 12

of 2019) whereby the claim made by the said Company was

rejected on the basis that the said Company has no ownership

to the assets vested in the State.

The Companys claim for a sum of rupees nearly 59 Million

relates to providing Consultancy Services to the Ceylinco Homes

International (Lotus Tower) Ltd. in respect of design and

construction of Ceylinco Celestial Residencies at No. 116 and

134/1, Galle Road, Colombo 3, which Assets, according to the

Company, were vested in the State by operation of the said Act.

According to section 4(2)(b) of the Act, the owner or owners of

any Underutilized Assets shall be entitled to receive prompt,

adequate and effective compensation in terms of the succeeding

provisions of the Act.

Section 4(3)(b) further states that the compensation payable

shall, in relation to an Underutilized Asset, reflect the value of

such Asset based on the ownership by one or more owners.

There cannot be any doubt that the said Company which

provided services to construct a luxury apartment complex in

the Assets vested is not the owner or one of the owners of the

said Assets.

Hence the determination of the Tribunal not to pay the said

Company for Consultancy Services provided was held in

CALA/8/2014 to be correct.

This case (CALA/9/2014) was filed by the Chairman of the said

Company in CALA/8/2014 (Professor Lakshman Alwis) on the

basis that the Chairman and the aforesaid Ceylinco Homes

4

International (Lotus Tower) Ltd. agreed to set off the Chairmans

component of the Consultancy Fees payable by Ceylinco Homes

International (Lotus Tower) Ltd. to the Company in

CALA/8/2014 against the payments due by the Chairman for

the Apartment No.1 on Level 27 of Ceylinco Celestial

Residencies, which the Chairman wanted to purchase.

It is the contention of the Chairman that a sum of US$ 176,735

has thus been set off against the purchase price of that

Apartment, and therefore he is entitled to claim that amount

under the Act as a payment made to purchase that Apartment.

This claim of the Chairman has also been rejected by the

Tribunal by X15 (of the same date as X5) giving the same

reason.

The Chairman admits that his name was not in the original List

of the prospective purchasers sent to the Tribunal by the

Ceylinco Homes International (Lotus Tower) Ltd. His contention

is that his name was sent later by document marked X11

produced with the petition.

The Tribunal denies receipt of X11 and further says that such a

copy was never produced by the Chairman at least during the

inquiry held prior to the impugned determination.

Without strenuously contesting that denial of the Tribunal, the

Chairman says that a Director of Ceylinco Homes International

(Lotus Tower) Ltd. by way of an affidavit dated 26.01.2016 has

affirmed these payments in a sum of US$ 176,735 for the said

identified Apartment.

5

This affidavit is dated more than one year after the impugned

determination and therefore there was no way the Tribunal

could make use of it to arrive at the determination.

This Court sitting in appeal cannot make a fresh determination

on new material.

I dismiss the appeal of the Petitioner, Chairman in Design

Consortium Limited, without costs.
