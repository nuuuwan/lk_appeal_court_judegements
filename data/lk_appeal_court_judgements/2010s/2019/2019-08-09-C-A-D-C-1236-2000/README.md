This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dated

04.09.2000.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Plaintiff) filed the above styled action in the District Court of Galle seeking

inter alia a declaration oftitle to the allotment of land marked Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625 (eI7) [Appeal

Brief page 168] dated 16.04.1984 made by H. Wisumperuma, Licensed Surveyor where the extent

is described as A.0-R.1-P.17 (also described as Lot 14 in Plan No. 269 dated 02.1898 made by John

De Zilva, Licensed Surveyor and Lot A in Plan No. 1701 dated 08.06.1989 (eI4) [Appeal Brief page

227] made by D. D. Ranaweera, Licensed Surveyor) situated at Ganegoda in Akmeemana where

the extent is said to be A.0-R.1-P.22 in extent.

The Defendants-Respondents (Defendants) filed answer admitting the corpus in dispute to be Lot

A in Plan No. 1701 and made a cross-claim for declaration of prescriptive title to the sa id

allotment of land.

I ,

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action of the Plaintiff on the basis

that the Plaintiff had failed to prove the corpus as the identical land referred to in the plaint and

that the Defendants had satisfied the court that they have prescriptive title to Lot A in Plan No.

1701. However, the learned Additional District Judge did not enter judgment as prayed for in the

cross-claim. The Plaintiff appealed.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 01.03.2019, both parties agreed that the only

issue to be determined is whether it has been established by evidence that Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625

is the same land which the parties have agreed to record as the admitted corpus in the trial court.

The learned District Judge has also concluded that the basic question to be decided was whether

the admitted corpus is the land described in the deeds produced by the Plaintiff during the trial

to establish his title.

This being a rei vindicatio action it was a paramount duty on the part ofthe Plaintiff to establish

correct boundaries in order to identify the land in dispute [Peeris v. Savunhamy (54 N.L.R. 207)].

There is a greater and heavy burden on a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action to prove not only that

he has dominium to the land in dispute but also the specific precise and definite boundaries when

claiming a declaration of title [Abeykoon Hamine v. Appuhamy (52 N.L.R. 49)]. To succeed in an

action rei vindicotio, the owner must prove on a balance of probabilities, not only his or her

ownership in the property, but also that the property exists and is clearly identifiable. The identity

of the land is fundamental for the purpose of attributing ownership, and for ordering ejectment

[Latheef v. Mansoor and another (2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 333]. In a vindicatory action it is necessary to

establish the identity ofthe corpus in a clear and unambiguous manner and the action must fail

upon the failure to do so [Fernando v. Somasiri (2012 B.L.R. 121)].

Since the identity of the corpus was a fundamental issue in the trial court, the Plaintiff had

executed a commission to prepare a new plan and Plan No. 1951 dated 12.11.1995 was made by

G. H. G. A. A. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor in which the disputed corpus is depicted as Lot A. While

admitting that he only superimposed the plan he prepared (i. e. Plan No. 1951) on Plan No. 1701

and didn't superimpose the plan he prepared on Plan No. 1625, he had stated that such a

superimposition was not needed as the boundaries of the two land portions (Lot A in Plan No.

1951 and Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625) tallied with each other [Appeal Brief page 69].

Page 3of7

The learned Additional District Judge held that the oral evidence of G. H. G. A. A. De Silva, Licensed

Surveyor cannot be relied upon since he failed to superimpose the said plans which were available

to him. I disagree with that finding of the learned Additional District Judge. Identifying a land by

its boundaries has been the practice for a long period of time and I am of the view that it can still

be considered as a valid method in identifying lands.

In Ratnayake and Others v. Kumarihamy and Others [(2005) 1 Sri.L.R. 303 at 307] Udalagama J.

held as follows:

"The contention of the learned Counsel for the defendants - appellants on the matter of

identity of the corpus sought to be partitioned also appeared to be that the trial court had

erred in deciding the matter on evidence ignoring the deeds and that the court ought to

have in fact decided the matter on a consideration of the contents of the deeds and not

by oral evidence (page 4 of the written submissions of the appellants)

I would disagree with the above submission as oral evidence under oath and subject to

cross examination, is equally important to arrive at a finding."

The next question that arises is whether Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625 is the same land that is depicted

as Lot 14 in Plan No. 269. According to Plan No. 1625, Lot 2 is a re-survey of Lot 14 in Plan No.

269. Furthermore, H. K. Alles, Licensed Surveyor, who gave evidence regarding Plan No. 1625 (as

H. Wisumperuma, Licensed Surveyor who prepared the said Plan No. 1625 was deceased at the

time of the trial), has categorically stated that it is clearly indicated in late H. Wisumperuma,

Licensed Surveyor's sketches and notes that he superimposed Lot 14 in Plan No. 269 on Lot 2 in

Plan No. 1625 and identified them to be the same land [Appeal Brief pages 87 - 88].

Furthermore, G. H. G. A. A. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor has in his report Xl [Appeal Brief page

166] stated that Lot 2 of plan no. 1625 prepared by H. Wisumperuma, Licensed Surveyor tallies

with the land surveyed by him.

Therefore, I hold that Lot 14 in Plan No. 269, Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625, Lot A in Plan No. 1701 and

Lot A in Plan No. 1951 is one and the same land.

There is a discrepancy of five (5) perches between lands identified in the plans. However, if the

portion of land is clearly described and can be precisely ascertained, a mere inconsistency in

extent will not affect the question of identity [Gabriel Perera v. Agnes Perera (43 c.L.W. 82), Yapa

v. Dissanayake Sedara (1989) 1 Sri. L. R. 361]. Since the disputed corpus can clearly be identified

by the aforementioned plans as well as by the boundaries (as specified by the parties in their

evidence), I hold that inconsistencies/discrepancies of five perches in extent can be disregarded.

Page 4 of 7

In any event the discrepancy of five (5) perches can be explained by the fact that the northern

boundary of Lot 2 in plan 1625 is not a straight line while the northern boundary of Lot A in plan

1701 is a straight line [Appeal brief page 63].

In a rei vindicatio action as in this case where the Defendants do not admit to be licensees of the

Plaintiff, the Plaintiff must strictly prove his title in order to succeed [Hameed v. Weerasinghe

(1989) 1 SrLL.R. 217, Abeykaan Hamine v. Appuhamy (52 N.L.R. 49), Peeris v. Savunhamy (54

N.L.R. 207), Silva v. Hendrick Appu (1 N.L.R. 13), Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy (65 N.L.R.

167), Pathirana v. Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169), Laku Menika v. Gunasekare (1997) 2 SrLL.R. 281].

During the trial, the Plaintiff has produced 3 documents (P1, P2 and P3) to establish his title.

According to Deed of Transfer No. 3058 dated 05.06.1984 (Pl), he has purchased Lot 2 in Plan

No. 1625 for a consideration of Rs. 300,000/-. The question to be considered is whether the

Vendors of P1 had title to the said Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625. It is stated in P1 that the Vendors

became entitled to Lot 2 in Plan No. 1625 by virtue of Deed of Partition No. 775 dated 05.06.1984

(P2).

In the Second Schedule of P2, Lot 2 is described referring to its boundaries and extent and it is

further stated that Lot 2 is a divided and a defined portion of Castle Hill Estate depicted in Plan

No. 269. Moreover, it is stated that Lot 2 is a portion from and out of the amalgamation of the 3

allotments of land fully described in the First Schedule of P2. According to the First Schedule of

P2, a defined portion of Castle Hill Estate consists of 3 lands called Mallemadolle Kanda (A.45-

R.2-P.0), Mallimodolla Kanda Addara (A.0-R.2-P.22) and undivided % of Henahurugodakanda

(A.1-R.0-P.4).

It is further stated in the First Schedule of P2 that the divided portion of Henahurugodakanda

which forms a portion of Castle Hill Estate is depicted as Lot 14 in Plan No. 269. Also, it can be

concluded that the divided % of Henahurugodakanda is A.0-R.1-P.21 in extent.

According to P2, the parties therein became entitled to the Castle Hill Estate by virtue of Deed of

Transfer No. 3713 dated 29.07.1955 (P3). The Schedule of P3 shows a list of lands which form the

entire Castle Hill Estate which is depicted in Plan No. 269. Under Item No. 16, it is stated that

undivided % of Henahurugodakanda (A.1-R.0-P.4) is a portion of Castle Hill Estate.

Page 5 of7

Based on this evidence, I hold that Plaintiff has established his title to the land in dispute and is

entitled to a declaration of title and eviction and damages as prayed for in the amended plaint.

For the sake of completeness, I will advert to the question of prescription as well.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (59 N.loR. 546 at page 548) loW. De Silva A.J. held:

"The paper title being in the 2nd and 3rd defendants, the burden of proving a title by

prescription was on the plaintiff. That burden he has failed to discharge. Apart from the

use of the word possess, the witnesses called by the plaintiff did not describe the manner

of possession . Such evidence is of no value where the Court has to find a title by

prescription. On this aspect, it is sufficient to recall the observations of Bertram C. J. in the

Full Bench Case of Alwis v. Perera [1 (1919) 21 N. lo R. at 326.] :

" I wish very much that District Judges-I speak not particularly, but generally-when

a witness says 'I possessed' or 'We possessed' or 'We took the produce', would

not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but would insist on those

words being explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon the

present practice of simply recording these words when stated by the witnesses,

and would see that such facts as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in

full and appear in the record. ""

I have given careful consideration to the evidence supporting the claim of prescriptive title of the

Defendant. I hold that he has failed to establish his claim.

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle dated 04.09.2000 and enter judgment as prayed for in the amended plaint dated 06.03.1996

and answer the issues as follows:
