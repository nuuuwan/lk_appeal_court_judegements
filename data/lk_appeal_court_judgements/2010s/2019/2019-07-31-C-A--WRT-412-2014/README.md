Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a registered Homeopathic Medical Officer. The Homeopathic Medical Council

(Council) appointed the Petitioner as Homeopathic Medical Officer in charge of the free

Homeopathic Dispensary at Ranwala, Kegalle with effect from 29.08.2001 (P2). The details of

payments and allowance to the staff of the dispensary was informed by the Registrar/Secretary

of the Council (P3).

The Petitioner claims that he was working as Homeopathic Medical Officer in charge of the free

Homeopathic Dispensary at Ranwala, Kegalle up to the time of filing of this application. He claims

that although he was paid the monthly travelling allowance of Rs. 500/= per month he was not

paid the approved monthly allowance of Rs. 11,000/= for the period 01.09.2001 to 31.12.2008.

The Petitioner prays for a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to pay the

said arrears of payment to the Petitioner for the said period.

A writ of mandamus will be issued only if there is a public or statutory duty. [De Alwis v. De Silva

(71 N.L.R. 108); Weligama Multi Purpase Cooperative Saciety Ltd. v. Chandradasa Daluwatta

(1984) 1 Sri.L.R. 195; Hakmana Multi Purpose Coaperative Society Ltd. v. Ferdinando (1985) 2

Sri.L.R. 272; Piyasiri v. People's Bank (1989) 2 Sri.L.R. 47; Sannasgala v. University at Kelaniya

(1991) 2 Sri.L.R. 193 and Samaraweera v. Minister of Public Administration (2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 64].

Hohfeld1 argued that there needs to be an understanding of the true nature of legal conceptions

and relations to obviate the difficulties posed by artificial dichotomies and constructs. He

pOinted out that "right", "duty", "liberty "and "no-right" are connected in a fundamental way

with each other. The existence of one brings about the existence of the other. Hofeld identified

only jural correlatives and opposites whereas Glanville Williams identified a third set of jural

relations which he referred to as jural contradictories. In this situation, the presence of one

conception in one party means the absence of the contradictory in the other party.

As S.N. Silva C.J. held (at page 15) in Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and Others [(S.C.

Appeal nos. 85/2008 & 101/2008; S.C.M. 01.06.2009]:

"Hence, stated in the form of a jural correlative, mandamus would lie when a statutory

duty is cast upon a public authority with a correlative right to demand its discharge."

The 1st Respondent to this application is D.M.R.B. Dissanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of

Health & Indigenous Medicine. The Petitioner has not established any statutory or public duty

which requires him to pay the allowance claimed to the Petitioner.

The 2nd Respondent is M.A. Perera, Registrar, Homeopathic Medical Council. The Petitioner has

not established any statutory or public duty which requires him to pay the allowance claimed to

the Petitioner.

The letter of appointment P2 shows that the Petitioner has been appointed to the post of

Homeopathic Medical Officer in charge of the free Homeopathic Dispensary at Ranwala, Kegalle

by the Council. In terms of section 2(2) of the Homeopathy Act NO. 7 of 1970 as amended, which

is the applicable law when this application was filed, the Council is a body corporate having

perpetual succession and may be sued and be sued in that name. Hence the employer of the

Petitioner is the Council and any arrears of the monthly allowance must be paid by the Council.

The Petitioner is an employee of a statutory entity and not a public officer.

However, even in that context such payment is due to the Petitioner in terms of a contract of

employment and not as a public or statutory duty. Contractual duties are not enforceable by a

writ of mandamus [Ratnayake and Others v. CD. Perera and Others (1982) 2 Sri.L.R. 451,

Weligama Multi Purpose Co-Operative Society Ltd. v. Chandradasa Daluwatta (1984) 1 Sri.L.R.

195, Jayaweera v. Wijeratne (1985) 2 Sri.L.R. 413, K.S. De Silva v. National Water Supply and

Drainage Board and Another (1989) 2 Sri.L.R. 1, National Savings Bank v. Chandrasiri (1991) 1

Sri.L.R. 91, Wickramasinghe v. Ceylon Electricity Board and Another (1997) 2 Sri.L.R. 377,

Jayawardena v. The People's Bank (2002) 3 Sri.L.R. 17, Mahanayake v. Chairman, Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and Others (2005) 2 Sri.L.R. 193].

There is also the question of delay. Petitioner has come to court after more than thirteen years

from the date of the alleged first default and more than five years after the end of the period for

which the arrears are claimed. The Petitioner has failed to explain the delay.

In Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R.

70] Jayasuriya J. held:

" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has discretion to deny him relief having regard

to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief."

Page 4 of 5

In that case relief was refused since there was a delay of over two and half years since making

the order challenged. The principle is equally applicable to the issue of a writ of mandamus.

For all the forgoing reasons, the application is dismissed without costs.
