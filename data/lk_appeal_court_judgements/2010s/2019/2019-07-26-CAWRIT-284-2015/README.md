Respondents.

Decided on: 25.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 4th respondent employer complained to the Commissioner of

Labour that although he was employed by the petitioner, Keels

Hotel Management Services Limited, as the Group Musician in the

Hotels and Resorts under its control and management from

October 1992-October 2012, his gratuity was not paid to him.

The petitioner took up the position that the 4th respondent was

never an employee of the petitioner, but was an independent

contractor providing services as Group Musician to various other

different entities, such as, Hotel SwaneeBeruwala, Ceylon

Holiday Resorts LtdBentota Beach Hotel, International Tourists

& Hoteliers Ltd, Travel Club Private LtdMale as seen from

3

documents marked P4-P8 tendered by the 4th respondent himself

to the Commissioner of Labour.1

After inquiry, the Commissioner of Labour rejected the said

defence of the petitioner and accepted the position put forward by

the 4th respondent and issued X4 directing the petitioner to pay a

sum of Rs. 3,018,031.25 as gratuity to the 4th respondent from

October 1992-October 2012 calculated on the basis of the last

drawn salary and years of service. The date of commencement of

the employment has been taken from P12, and the date of

cessation of employment and the last drawn salary from P83 and

P94.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash X4 by way of

certiorari.

It is common ground that an employee is entitled to statutory

benefits whereas the independent contractor is not.

So much has been written and so many theories/tests such as

Control Test, Integration Test, Dominant Impression Test,

Mutuality of Obligation Test, Multiple Factor Test have been

evolved on how to distinguish an employee from an independent

contractor. It is undoubtedly a vexed question, which does not

have a straightforward answer. Therefore it is now largely accepted

that whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor

is purely a question of fact to be decided on unique facts and

circumstances of each individual case. In this process, labels,

designations, particular terms used by the employer in the

documents exchanged between the two parties, the manner in

which the payments were made for the services etc. are, more often

than not, misleading and not binding.

Hence the argument of the learned President's Counsel for the

petitioner that the 4th respondent has not tendered a letter of

appointment, a letter of termination, a letter of transfer, a letter of

retirement, a contract of employment, salary slips etc. to prove

employer-employee relationship between the petitioner and him,

and therefore the 4th respondent is not an employee of the

petitioner is unacceptable.

Section 20 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983, as

amended, defines the words "employer" and "workman" in the

following manner.

"employer" means any person who employs or, on whose

behalf any other person employs any workman and includes

a body of employers (whether such body is a body corporate

or unincorporate or a public corporation) or any person who on

behalf of any other person employs any workman and any

person or body of employers who or which has ceased to be

an employer but does not include a co-operative society

established under the Co-operative Societies Law, No. 5 of

1972, or a local authority.

"workman" means any person who has entered into or works

under a contract with an employer in any capacity, whether

the contract is expressed or implied, oral or in writing and

whether it is a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a

5

contract personally to execute any work or labour and

includes any person ordinarily employed under any such

contract whether such person is or is not in employment at

any particular time, and includes any workman whose

services have been terminated.

Then it is clear that the words "employer" and "employee" have

been given a liberal meaning in the Act to prevent the employers

from taking high technical objections to deny the employee his

statutory dues.

What is there in the instant case to establish employer-employee

relationship between the petitioner and the 4th respondent?

By P12 dated 20.05.20035 the Managing Director of the petitioner

has written to the Principal, Trinity College of Kandy "to confirm

that [the 4th respondent] is employed in our establishment in the

capacity of Group Entertainer. His basic monthly remuneration is

Rs.75,000/=." The petitioner says that it was given as a help.

Whatever may be the reason for issuing that letter, the petitioner

does not say that the Managing Director of the petitioner has

stated an utter falsehood in that letter. Can this Court believe that

a reputed company such as the petitioner, which, according to the

Group Directory marked 1R6, is in charge of Hotel Management in

Leisure Section of the John Keels Group, would issue bogus letters

addressed to responsible institutions in order to help people who

are not employees of them?

P11 is another letter dated 26.08.20036 issued by the Managing

Director of the petitioner "to confirm that [the 4th respondent] is

employed in our establishment in the capacity of Group Entertainer.

His basic monthly remuneration is Rs.75,000/=." The petitioner

now says that it was issued to the 4th respondent to obtain a loan

from a Bank. Whatever may be the reason, the point is whether it

is an unauthenticated letter or a letter containing incorrect facts.

Neither of them.

P3 dated 17.12.19997 is revealing. That is a formal letter written

by the Managing Director of the petitioner addressed to the

petitioner in reply to a letter sent by the latter to the former

seeking enhancement of his monthly salary. The body of the letter

reads as follows:

I write with reference to your letter of 7th December wherein

you have requested an enhanced remuneration for your

services.

We are pleased to inform you that with effect from January 1,

2000 we will increase your remuneration to Rs.75,000/= per

month which will be valid for a period of three years up to

31st December, 2002 as agreed by you.

All other terms and conditions of your engagement will remain

unchanged.

Please return the duplicate of this letter, duly countersigned in

confirmation of your acceptance of the above, for our records.

It may be recalled that the position taken up by the petitioner was

that it had nothing to do with the 4th respondent being employed

as an independent contractor by various hotels managed by the

petitioner, which are, in the eyes of the law, separate legal entities.

Hotel Swanee is one such hotel where the petitioner was employed

as a Group Musician.

P4, Withholding Tax Deduction Form, is relevant to Hotel Swanee.

Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner made submissions

vigorously on the withholding tax deductions done in respect of

payments made to the 4th respondent as reflected in P4-P78 to say

that those deductions decisively prove that the 4th respondent was

an independent contractor as opposed to an employer who drew a

monthly salary.

But 4R1 negates that contention. If I may elaborate it further, if

the 4th respondent was not an employee under the petitioner, but

an independent contractor under various other hotels, there was

no reason for the 4th respondent to write to the petitioner for

enhancement of his monthly salary when he was at that time

admittedly being employed by Hotel Swanee, and there was no

corresponding duty on the part of the petitioner to formally reply to

it. Be noted that the letter written by the Managing Director of the

petitioner is addressed to: "Mr. Chuti Padmaperuma (the 4th

respondent), Hotel Swanee, Moragolla, Beruwala". When that letter

is read it is abundantly clear that the 4th respondent had been

working for the petitioner as his master in various other hotels

under the control or management of the petitioner for a fixed

8 Pages 60-63 of X.

monthly salary. Who made the payment and how payment was

made to the 4th respondent etc. are irrelevant for the purpose of

the payment of the Gratuity Act.

This can be explained by another Withholding Tax Deduction Form

marked by the 4th respondent but relied upon by the petitioner.

Monthly salary increasement in P3 is applicable to 01.01.2000-

31.12.2002. Withholding Tax Deduction Form P69, is relevant to

the month of February 2001. That means, it covers the period

stated in P3. It may be noted that, although by P3 monthly salary

was increased by the petitioner, the name of the payer stated in P6

is "International Tourists & Hoteliers Ltd". That goes to prove that

Withholding Tax Deduction Forms heavily relied on by the

petitioner to say that the 4th respondent is an independent

contractor and not an employee under the petitioner or any other

Keels Group Hotels are shams.

P210 is another letter issued by the Managing Director of the

petitioner to the 4th respondent regarding Keels Hotel Management

Services Limited Staff facilities being extended to the 4th

respondent. It says that the 4th respondent would be entitled to

the same concessions as all the other employees in the Keels Hotel

Management Services Limited are entitled to when visiting any of

the Group's Hotels, and the same staff facilities whenever he is

entertaining there. In general, no independent contractors are

given such concessions or facilities by way of a formal letter.

P811 is a contract of employment entered into between Travel Club

Private Ltd of Male as the employer and the 4th respondent as the

employee. The learned President's Counsel for the petitioner

vehemently submits that Travel Club Private Ltd is a company

incorporated in Male and nothing to do with the petitioner. But by

looking at the Group Directory of the John Keels Holdings PLC

marked 1R6, it is clear that, Travel Club Private Ltd of Male is a

resort hotel of John Keels Group under the management of the

petitioner. On behalf of the Travel Club Private Ltd P8 has been

signed by Sunimal Senanayake, the Executive Vice President of

John Keels Holdings as Sector Head of Maldivian Resorts. It may

be noted that he was the officer who has sometimes represented

the petitioner at the inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour12

and tendered counter affidavit dated 16.06.2016 on behalf of the

petitioner in Court.

The Managing Director who issued P11 and P12 confirming that

the 4th respondent was an employer under the petitioner in the

capacity of Group Entertainer with the basic monthly salary of

Rs.75,000/= is the officer who tendered the affidavit affirming the

facts stated in the original petition.

Hence the argument of the learned President's Counsel that Travel

Club Private Ltd, which employed the 4th respondent by P8 is a

distinct company which has been incorporated under the Laws of

Male and therefore nothing to do with the petitioner is

unacceptable in the eyes of the law regarding payments of gratuity.

11 Page 64 of X. 12 Pages 47-48 of X.

I hold that the Commissioner of Labour cannot be found fault with

when the petitioner was ordered to pay gratuity in a sum of Rs.

3,018,031/25 for the period of October 1992-October 2012

calculated on the last drawn salary.

The learned President's Counsel for the petitioner takes up another

two technical objections seeking to quash the decision of the

Commissioner of Labour.

One is that there was no fair hearing before the Commissioner of

Labour. I must straightaway say that this is a highly unreasonable

accusation. This can be understood by reading the averments of

the petition. At the request of the petitioner the inquiry has been

held twice. With full legal representation, the petitioner has filed

two sets of comprehensive written submissionsone dated

14.08.201413 and the other dated 29.10.201414. The simple

position taken up by the petitioner before the Commissioner of

Labour was that the 4th respondent was never an employee under

the petitioner. The petitioner had nothing else to say and nothing

to prove.

In that backdrop the issue which the Commissioner of Labour had

to decide was whether the 4th respondent was an employee of the

petitioner or not. The Commissioner has decided that the 4th

respondent was.

The second objection is failure to give reasons to the said

conclusion. Although the Commissioner of Labour has not given

reasons for that conclusion, I am fully convinced that the said

13 Pages 38-41 of X. 14 Pages 7-15 of X.

11

conclusion is flawless in the facts and circumstances of this case,

which I have discussed above. It would have been very easy for me

to have quashed that decision at the stroke of a pen on the ground

that no reasons have been given. Had I done so, it would have

been a grave injustice to the employee, the weaker party, who may

be on the last lap of his long journey of life. The employee cannot

be made to suffer for which he is not responsible and has no

control over.

I dismiss the application with costs.
