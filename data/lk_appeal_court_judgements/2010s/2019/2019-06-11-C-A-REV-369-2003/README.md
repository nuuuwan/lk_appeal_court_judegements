Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. After the Judgment was pronounced

and the interlocutory decree entered, the petitioner filed an

application in the District Court seeking intervention of the

action to have a trial de novo. This was rightly rejected by the

District Judge. Thereafter the petitioner came before this Court

by way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum seeking the same

relief.

The only reason given by the petitioner for being unable to

become a party to the partition action was his residence being

about 100 miles away from the land to be partitioned. This

cannot be a good ground to allow the petitioners application.

The explanation is manifestly unacceptable.

Be that as it may, the petitioners application as presented in the

petition is obviously devoid of merits.

The petitioner in the petition claims share of the corpus on a

different pedigree. He does not in the petition connect his

pedigree to the plaintiffs pedigree accepted by Court. According

that pedigree (as seen from paragraphs 15-18 of the petition),

one Bodaragamage Ebraham Gunasekera was entitled to

3

share of the corpus by a Testamentary Case No.6195 of the

District Court of Colombo; and after his death his rights were

devolved on his four children; and the said four children

transferred those rights to Ariyasinghe; and Ariyasinghe

transferred them to the father of the petitioner; and the

petitioner succeeded to the fathers rights.

The said Testamentary Case record (filed in 1918) has been

tendered marked L1, and according to that case record: (a) there

is no mention about Bodaragamage Ebraham Gunasekera and

(b) there is no reference that he received any interest from the

land to be partitioned. Hence there is no necessity to consider

the alleged subsequent transactions as one cannot transfer what

one does not have. In my view, this application should have

been dismissed without issuing notice.

When this was pointed out at the argument, the petitioner has

filed written submissions dated 14.12.2006 to say that in the

Fiscal Conveyance dated 10.05.1937 marked at the trial by the

plaintiff P1, Gunasekeras entitlement through the Testamentary

Case for share has been established; and according to P1,

only 4/7 out of share of Gunasekara has been sold in

execution of a writ; and the petitioner shall therefore be entitled

to the balance share out of share.

This goes to show that the petitioner changes his position as he

goes along to suit the occasion, and he has not acted with

uberimma fides when he first filed this application. That itself

warrants dismissal of the petitioners application.

It is clear that the petitioner has filed this belated application

seeking to set aside the partition Judgment on conjectures. He

4

does not have a clear idea of his entitlement to the land.

Revision is a discretionary remedy.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner. No costs.
