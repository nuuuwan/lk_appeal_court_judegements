Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case has a chequered history.

There is no dispute regarding identification of the land. I will

accept for the purpose of this case that the land is depicted in

Plan marked R4, tendered by the respondents.

The petitioners are in possession of this land.

The 1st respondent, the Divisional Secretary of Welivitiya-

Divithura, according to the petitioners, at the instigation of the

2nd respondent, made several attempts to dispossess the 4th

petitioner from this land.

They are as follows:

1. In or about 1998 a case was filed in the Magistrates Court

of Baddegama under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, No.7 of 1979, as amended, against

Sarathchandra Epa, a predecessor of the petitioners,

which was dismissed due to lack of territorial jurisdiction.

2. Case No.78888 was filed against Epa, in the Magistrates

Court of Elpitiya, under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, which application was allowed.

3. The High Court reversed this order in case No.

HC/Revision/235/1999 marked P9. As seen from the

Judgment of the High Court, the Court has inter alia relied

on the Certificate of Quiet Possession tendered by the said

Epa, which I will refer to later, in arriving at that decision.

No appeal was made against this Judgment of the High

Court by the State.

3

4. Case No. 94084 was filed in the Magistrates Court of

Elpitiya under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, against Epa, which was later abandoned upon the

death of Epa.

5. Case No.991 was filed in the Magistrates Court of Elpitiya

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act against

the 4th petitioner, which was dismissed by the Magistrates

Court by order marked P14 relying on the earlier High

Court Judgment and the aforementioned Certificate of

Quiet Possession. No appeal has been made against this

order by the State.

6. Failing all the attempts to recover possession under the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the Divisional

Secretary has then taken steps to acquire the land under

the Land Acquisition Act on the basis that this is a private

land.

Section 2 Notice marked P15 was sent stating that it is

necessary for the Southern Development Authority.

The vesting order under section 38(a) marked P16 has

been made.

The petitioners have filed the writ application No.

CA/Writ/658/2008 to get that order quashed, but later

withdrawn.

7. Thereafter, as seen from P20, the petitioners have filed

CA/Writ/778/2008, and the proceedings of that case has

been terminated on the State informing Court that the

land is no longer required by the Southern Development

Authority.

4

It is in that backdrop, the Divisional Secretary again served the

Quit Notice marked P21 on the 4th petitioner under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to eject her from the land.

It is this Quit Notice marked P21 which the petitioners seek to

quash by writ of certiorari. The petitioners also seek an order in

the nature of writ of prohibition, prohibiting the respondents

from taking further steps under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act to evict the petitioners.

The respondents have filed objections to this application.

The petitioners claim title to this land by deeds and by the

Certificate of Quiet Possession issued under section 7 of the

Crown Lands Ordinance, No. 12 of 1840. This Certificate of

Quiet Possession has been tendered by the respondents as R1.

The learned counsel for the petitioners has referred to page 33 of

the book titled Select Laws on State Lands authored by R.K.W.

Goonesekere, which reads as follows:

Section 7 of the Ordinance also provided for Certificate of

Queit Possession (CQP) to be given to a person on

application if the Crown has no claim to the land. The CQP

is good and valid title against the Crown and is sometimes

followed by crown grant. Earlier it was possible to get a

certificate from the District Court under the Lands (Edictile

Citations) Ordinance No. 7 of 1835 which gave a good and

valid title.

The petitioners came before this Court against the Quit Notice

issued, and before the application was filed in the Magistrates

5

Court seeking eviction under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act.

Even if the 1st respondent filed the application in the

Magistrates Court, the 4th respondent could, in terms of section

9(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, have taken

up the defence that: he is in possession or occupation of the land

upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted

in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid.

Let me now consider the standpoint of the learned Senior State

Counsel for the respondents on the said Certificate of Quiet

Possession marked R1.

Firstly, the learned SSC states that R1 is invalid, because, as

seen from R1(a), it has not been registered in the Land Registry

under the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

Elaborating this point further, the learned SSC in paragraph 16

of the written submission states as follows:

SC Appeal 32/2009 decided on 4.3.2010 refers to the

application of section 7 of the Act which states that all

instruments made before or after the 1st January 1864,

unless it is duly registered, be void against all parties

claiming an adverse interestIt does not affect the validity

of the title but states that unregistered instruments are

void against subsequent registered instruments and such

instrument means an instrument affecting land.

6

According to R1(a), the extracts from the Land Registry, R1 has

been executed on 05.06.1865, that is, after 01.01.1864. On the

other hand, there is no subsequent registered instrument in

respect of the land, under the registration of Documents

Ordinance.

As the learned counsel for the petitioners submits, the

registration under the Registration of Documents Ordinance

does not determine title to a particular land. Registration will

only give priority against an unregistered or subsequently

registered instrument.

Secondly, the learned SSC by tendering the Gazette dated

16.11.1934 marked R2 states that this land was settled in

favour of the Crown under the Land Settlement Ordinance.

The respondents in paragraph 8(c) of the statement of objections

state that The existence of the above mentioned land settlement

gazette in relation to the subject state land was not known to the

predecessors of the office of Divisional Secretary of Walipitiya-

Divithura Divisional Secretariat until much later.

If that argument is to be accepted, there is no end to litigation,

and there is no meaning to the doctrine of res judicata. The

doctrine of res judicata applies to all matters which existed at the

time of giving the judgment and which the party had an

opportunity of bringing before Court.1

1 Banda vs. Karohamy (1948) 50 NLR 369 at 373, Jane Nona v. Mohamadu (1932) 1 CLW 158, Sinniah v. Eliakutty (1932) 1 CLW 253 at 254.

7

The doctrine of res judicata, as the Supreme Court in Stassen

Exports Ltd v. Lipton Ltd2 expressed, has found justification in

two fundamental principles: The first principle, which is public in

nature, is based on the maxim interest rei publicae ut sit finis

litium (in the interest of the state that there be an end to litigation)

and secondly on the footing of a maxim, private in nature, namely,

nemo debet bis vexari pro un at eadem causa (that no person

should be proceeded against twice for the same cause).

This Judgment of mine shall not be understood that when a

case is dismissed on whatever the ground, res judicata applies. I

do not propose to discuss the whole gamut of res judicata here.

But in the facts and circumstance of this case, I hold that: (a)

the respondents cannot now cling on R2 to justify the Quit

Notice issued under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, which is being challenged in this case; and (b) insofar as the

recovery of possession of this land under the provisions of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is concerned, the

matter is res judicata.

I quash the Quit Notice marked P21 by way of writ of certiorari

as prayed for in paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition; and

also prohibit the respondents by way of writ of prohibition from

taking further actions to evict the petitioners from the land

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.
