****** M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Petitioner above named filed this application on 31.10.2015

seeking inter alia:

a. to issue an order in the nature of writ certiorari quashing the

declaration marked X9 made under Section 49 of the Land

Development Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 as amended in favour

of the 1st respondent dated 29.01.1996

b. to issue an order in the nature of writ of mandamus directing

the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to issue a declaration in favour of

the Petitioner in terms of Section 49 of the Land Development

Ordinance in relation to the aforementioned property referred to

in exhibit marked as X1 in the Petition.

According to the Petition, the basis of filing this application by the

Petitioner in detail is that:

3

One Kattadige David (now deceased) by virtue of Grant

No. 226 dated 20.03.1986, issued in terms of provisions contained in

Section 19(6) read together with Section 19(4) of the Land

Development Ordinance became the owner of the land called

Kiwularahena lot 119 of FVP Plan No. 52 which is in extent of 0.987

hectares situated at Kiwulara Sittarama Grama Niladharis Division,

Wellawaya Korala, Thanamalwila, Moneragala.

The Petitioner stated that the said Kattadige David was

unmarried and died issueless and at the time of his death (on

21.12.1995) his parents were deceased and under those

circumstances the succession to said grant should have been

determined in terms of the 3rd Schedule given in the Land

Development Ordinance. Therefore, the Petitioner stated that

accordingly, he is the sole brother of the deceased Kattadige David

and he is the person who is entitled to the succession of the said

holding Grant No. 226.

The Petitioner further revealed that the 1st Respondent

above named is a nephew of the said Kattadige David and he was

attempting to alienate the said property on his own will. Therefore, the

Petitioner inquired into the situation of the said grant of his brother

Kattadige David and he became aware that the 1st Respondent by

suppressing the existence of the Petitioner who is the brother of the

deceased original owner had got him purportedly succeeded to the

said grant by declaration dated 29.01.1996.

It was the position of the Petitioner that, the 1st

Respondent, a nephew of the deceased Kattadige David and nephews

are placed in term No. (xi) of the aforementioned table set in the 3rd

schedule of the Land Development Ordinance, therefore, the

succession of a grant or holding should take place strictly in terms of

4

the said schedule and if a brother of the deceased is survive, nephews

who are placed at the 11th position (No. (xi)) of the said table has no

legal right for succession of the grant in question.

The Petitioner further submitted that the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents, the officials who are responsible for determination of

succession in a case of death of a person who has been given a grant

or holding; and 2nd and 3rd Respondent prior to issuing of the said

declaration under Section 49 of the Land Development Ordinance had

totally failed to hold a proper inquiry after giving due notices to the

family members and relatives of the original owner Kattadige David

and acted merely on false representation made by the 1st Respondent

who is not in fact legally entitled for a succession to the said grant in

terms of the table set out on the 3rd schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance and thereby had acted in violation of the natural justice

Thus, the Petitioner believes that, considering the above

circumstances, the Petitioner is entitled to obtain a permit in relation

to the said property of Kattadige David and on that basis not sought

to quash the decision to grant a permit made on behalf of the 1st

Respondent made by the 2nd and 3rd Respondent and also sought for a

mandamus against the 2nd Respondent directing them to issue a

permit in favour of the Petitioner which he is entitled to in accordance

with provisions contained in Land Development Ordinance.

However, the 1st to 4th Respondents conjointly submitted

and brought an important fact that the said Kattadige David had

named the 1st Respondent as successor of the property by letter

marked 2R1 dated 20.12.1995. Having satisfied the document 2R1,

the 2nd Respondent acted under Section 49 of the Land Development

Ordinance and the said nomination was duly registered on or about

14.02.1996 as per documents annexed as X8 and X9. They further

5

submitted that, having known all these facts, the Petitioner made a

request by way of an affidavit dated 21.02.2011 (marked as 2R2) to

the 2nd Respondent, almost 15 years after the transfer has taken

place.

Therefore, the learned State Counsel for the 2nd to 4th Respondents

argued that the instant application would be dismissed on the basis of

delay in filling the application and misconceives and untenable in law.

It is to be noted that the Petitioner had instituted an

action bearing Case No. 181/L in the District Court of Wellawaya on

or about 30.10.2012 against the aforesaid declaration (X9) of the 2nd

Respondent and the learned District Judge by his order dated

28.01.2013 dismissed the action. Thereafter, the Petitioner had

preferred a writ application bearing No. 03/2013 at the Provincial

High Court of Uva, Holden in Monaragala on or about 28.03.2013

seeking for writ of certiorari to quash the declaration (X9) and writ of

mandamus to issue a declaration under Section 49 of the Land

Development Ordinance in favour of the Petitioner in relation to the

said property.

Perusal of the said document 2R1 shows that, said

Kattadige David had gave an authority to the 1st Respondent to act as

successor of the property. Having satisfied with the said letter, the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents have acted under Section 49 of the Land

Development Ordinance and made declaration in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance in favour of the 1st Respondent, afterward,

the said declaration (replacement/nomination) was duly registered as

per the documents appended as X8 and X9.

6

Therefore, I am of the firm view that, when an Apex Court

spread out its discretionary power, especially in a writ application, the

Court bound with a duty to evaluate whether the applicant has acted

with the utmost promptitude to proceed his/her case. This

appraisal duty of an Apex Court reiterated in many instances [vide:

Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services

(1996) 2 SLR 70; Babu Appu vs. Simon Appu (1907) 11 NLR 44 and

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited vs. Shanmugam (1995)

1 SLR 55)]

In this application, it is crystal clear that the Petitioner

has not acted with the utmost promptitude when he decided to come

before a Court of law (i.e. District Court) more than 15 years after the

2nd Respondent reject his claim. As held by several cases in our

Courts, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation as to why the

alleged party could not come before a Court of law in time is

considered as delay in a review application.

Further, I observed that, as I stated earlier, the said

Kattadige David had named the 1st Respondent as the successor of the

property by letter marked 2R1 dated 20.12.1995. Having satisfied the

document 2R1, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents acted under Section 49 of

the Land Development Ordinance and the said nomination was duly

registered on or about 14.02.1996 as per documents annexed as X8

and X9. Only the Respondents were brought these facts to this Court,

the Petitioner had not referred/questioned any fact from the said 2R1-

the consent letter of the deceased.

At this juncture, I would like to re-call the following words

of Saleem Marsoof, P.C., J. in the case of NAMUNUKULA

PLANTATIONS LTD. VS. MINISTER OF LANDS AND OTHERS [S.C.

Appeal No. 46/2008, S. C. Minutes dated 13.03.2012]:

7

It is settled law that a person who approaches the

Court for grant of discretionary relief, to which

category an application for certiorari would

undoubtedly belong, has to come with clean hands,

and should candidly disclose all the material facts

which have any bearing on the adjudication of the

issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes a

duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides) to the court

to make a full and complete disclosure of all material

facts and refrain from concealing or suppressing any

material fact within his knowledge or which he could

have known by exercising diligence expected of a

person of ordinary prudence...

Hence, on the grounds of (lack of) utmost promptitude

and the variance on the important facts, the application of the

Petitioner is liable to be dismissed.

Accordingly, I dismiss this application without costs.

Application dismissed.
