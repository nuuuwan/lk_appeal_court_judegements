By an amended petition dated 25th March 2013, the Petitioner has sought the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice1 issued by the 1st Respondent

in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act NO.7 of 1979, as

amended (the Act); and

b) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st to 3rd Respondents to issue a

permit to the Petitioner in respect of the said land from which the

Petitioner is sought to be ejected.

1 By the said quit notice, annexed to the petition marked 'P27', the 1st Respondent had sought to evict the

Petitioner from Lot No. 782 depicted in Plan No. FVP 387 dated 8th November 1987.

'f

There are two issues that arise in this application for the consideration of this

Court. The first is whether the 1st Respondent, the Divisional Secretary of

Haputale was entitled to issue a quit notice to the Petitioner and subsequently

make an application for ejectment under Section 5 of the Act and obtain an

order from the Magistrate's Court to evict the Petitioner from the said land.

The second issue is whether a Writ of Mandamus could be granted to compel a

public authority to issue a permit to the Petitioner in respect of the said land,

under and in terms of the Land Development Ordinance.

The facts of this case briefly are as follows.

The subject matter of this application is a State land depicted as Lot No. 782 in

Final Village Plan No. 387 dated 8th November 1987, annexed to the petition

marked 'Pl', situated in the village of Ella Aluthwela within the Divisional

Secretariat of Haputale in the District of Badulla. It is admitted between the

parties that in or around 1960, the State had issued R.P.D Juwanis Appuhamy a

permit in respect of a land in extent of 2 roods. The said land includes the

aforementioned Lot No. 782. The Petitioner claims that in 1977, Juwanis

Appuhamy along with his wife Isabel Perera sold the said land to the Petitioner

for a sum of Rs. 1500 and handed over possession of the 2 roods of land to the

Petitioner. The Petitioner has annexed to the petition marked 'P2' a receipt

signed by Juwanis Appuhamy, acknowledging the receipt of a sum of Rs. 1500.

This Court observes that the receipt 'P2' does not disclose the purpose for

which the money was being paid nor does it refer to any land. It however does

refer to an affidavit which has not been produced with the petition.

The Petitioner states that in 1987, a roadway was constructed across the said

land, resulting in the land being divided into three lots, identified in 'Pl' as Lot

No. 781 in extent of 24P which the Petitioner states is the road reservation, Lot

No. 782 in extent of 12.8P and Lot No. 783 in extent of lR 26.8P. It does not

appear that Lot No. 781, although State land, formed part of the land given on

a permit to Juwanis Appuhamy for the reason that Lot No. 781 has been

referred to as a reservation for a waterway in the Surveyors report annexed to

the petition marked 'P1S'. Furthermore, the cumulative extent of Lot Nos. 782

and 783 is 79.6P which is almost identical to the extent of the land given to

Juwanis Appuhamy.

In March 1994, the Divisional Secretary of Haputale, acting in terms of Section

109 of the Land Development Ordinance2, proceeded to cancel the permit

issued to Juwanis Appuhamy on the basis that Juwanis Appuhamy had violated

the conditions of the permit by inter alia alienating the said land to the

Petitioner3.

In December 1994, Isabel Perera, the wife of Juwanis Appuhamy had been

issued an annual permit, in respect of Lot No. 782, under the provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance. It appears from the evidence led in the District

Court that Isabel Perera had paid the rental for 1995 and that the State would

2Section 109 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows: "(1) If the permit-holder fails to appear on the date and at the time and place specified in a notice issued under section 106, or appears and states that he has no cause to show why his permit should not be cancelled, the Government Agent may, if he is satisfied that there has been due service of such notice and that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the permit, make order cancelling such permit but no such order shall be made until after the expiry of a period of fourteen days reckoned from the date specified in the notice issued under section 106."

3 The permit had been cancelled by notice dated 3

rd February 1994, annexed to the petition marked 'P3', for the following reasons: 01. Il ~ ~~ . 02. 1l<5 ~oe) ~)e) .

have extended the permit in respect of Lot No. 782 if not for the pending

litigation between the Petitioner and Isabel Perera and her family, with regard

to Lot No. 782.4 The action filed in the District Court was determined in favour

of Isabel Perera by the learned District Judge. However, on appeal by the

Petitioner in this case, the learned High Court judge set aside the said

judgment in November 2010, on the basis that Isabel Perera had no title to

vindicate, as the permit issued in 1995 had not been extended.

The Petitioner states that since 1992, she has sought a permit for Lot Nos. 782

and 783 by writing to various government authorities. This Court observes that

even though the Petitioner has annexed the responses that were received to

such requests, the requests themselves have not been annexed to the petition.

Be that as it may, the Petitioner states that while her request for a permit was

under consideration by the 3rd Respondent Land Commissioner General, the 1st

Respondent Divisional Secretary, Haputale, had issued to the Petitioner a letter

dated 26th October 2012 annexed to the petition marked 'p2S', which reads as

follows:

'P25' was accompanied by two quit notices, issued under Section 3 of the Act,

one in respect of the reservation for the water way Lot No. 781, annexed to

the petition marked 'P26', and the other in respect of Lot No. 782, annexed to

the petition marked 'P27', directing the Petitioner to vacate the said lands on

or before 30th November 2012 and to hand over vacant possession to the

Grama Niladari of Ellegama.

This Court must at this stage observe that the 1st Respondent did not issue a

quit notice in respect of Lot No. 783, which is the larger of the three lots of

lands. In fact, on 11th February 2013, the State has issued to the Petitioner a

permit under Section 19{2} of the Land Development Ordinance, annexed to

the petition, marked 'P31', in respect of Lot No. 783. The Respondents have

submitted that the Petitioner was subsequently issued a grant under Section

19{4} of the Land Development Ordinance by HE the President in respect of Lot

6 No. 783.

As the Petitioner did not comply with the quit notices 'P26' and 'P27', the 1st

Respondent filed an application for ejectment in terms of Section 5 of the Act

in the Magistrate's Court of Bandarawela seeking to eject the Petitioner from

Lot Nos. 781 and 782.7 After inquiry, the learned Magistrate had proceeded to

make an order on 22nd March 2013, ejecting the Petitioner and all those

claiming under her, from Lot Nos. 781 and 7828. It appears from paragraph

36{a} of the amended petition that the Petitioner is not seeking to interfere

with the order of the learned Magistrate in respect of Lot No. 781, as the

5 1R 26.8P.

6 A copy of the said Grant has been annexed to the Statement of Objections of the 1st Respondent, marked 'lR1'.

7 The applications for ejectment have been annexed to the petition, marked 'P28' and 'P29'.

8 Vide journal entry of 28th March 2013.

6

Petitioner admits that although she was in possession of a small strip of land

from this Lot, she was never in full possession of the said land and that the said

land consisting of 0.060 Hectares was a reservation.

The present application before this Court for a Writ of Certiorari is to quash

the quit notice marked 'p27' in respect of Lot No. 782 and to set aside the

order of the learned Magistrate. This Court observes that the Petitioner has

not disclosed whether a revision application has been made to set aside the

said Order 'p32'.

It is admitted by the Petitioner that the land in question is State land. It is

further admitted by the Petitioner that she came into possession of the entire

land in an unauthorised manner, by Ipurchasing' the said land from Juwanis

Appuhamy. This Court observes that Juwanis Appuhamy was not permitted in

terms of the Land Development Ordinance to alienate the said land to a third

party and the permit issued to Juwanis Appuhamy had quite correctly been

cancelled by the Divisional Secretary. The Petitioner was therefore in

unauthorised possession of the entire land given to Juwanis Appuhamy and

was thus a trespasser, until a permit was issued in respect of Lot No. 783 in

February 2013. However, the Petitioner continued to be in unauthorized

possession or occupation of Lot Nos. 781 and 782.

In considering the application for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice

'P27', it would be appropriate for this Court to bear in mind the following

statement of Lord Diplock in the case of Council of Civil Service Unions vs

Minister for the Civil Service9 :

91985 AC 374.

"Judicial review has, I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The

first ground I would call "illegality", the second "irrationality" and the

third "procedural impropriety."

"By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable."

This Court would now proceed to consider whether the 1st Respondent acted

illegally when he issued the quit notices 'P26' and 'P27'.

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was introduced in 1979 to

provide for an expeditious mode of recovery of state land from persons who

were in unauthorised possession or occupation of such state lands.lO The

purpose of the Act has been discussed in the case of Namunukula Plantations

PlC v. Nimal Punchihewall, where this Court has held as follows:

lOlhalapathirana vs Bulankulame, Director-General U.D.A [1988 (1) Sri LR 416 at 420] - tiThe clear object of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is to secure possession of such land by an expeditious machinery without recourse to an ordinary civil action".

11 CA (PHC) APN 29/2016; CA Minutes of 9th July 2018.

((A competent authority can have recourse to the [State Lands (Recovery

of Possession)] Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized possession

or occupation of state land including possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land. Any possession or occupation without fa

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law' is unauthorized possession".

A very strict regime has been put in place by the legislature in order to achieve

the said purpose of the Act. In terms of Section 3 of the Act, where the

Competent Authority is of the opinion that any land is State land and that any

person is in unauthorised possession or occupation of such land, he may issue

a quit notice to the person in possession of the property identified in the said

notice, requiring such person to vacate the said land with his dependents, if

any, and deliver vacant possession of such land, on a date not less than thirty

days from the date of the issue of the said quit notice. In terms of Section

3(lA) of the Act, f no person shall be entitled to any hearing or to make any

representation in respect of a notice under subsection (1)'. In the event the

person in possession fails to vacate such land and deliver vacant possession,

the Competent Authority shall be entitled in terms of Section 5 of the Act to

file an application for ejectment in the Magistrate's Court. The learned

Magistrate is thereafter required to issue summons in terms of Section 6 of the

Act to the person named in the said application to appear and to show cause

as to why he should not be ejected from the land as prayed for in the

application for ejectment. The scope of the Inquiry that has to be held by the

learned Magistrate and the defenses that could be taken up by a person

against whom an application has been filed for ejectment have been set out in

Section 9 of the Act, which reads as follows:

Q

"At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has been

served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the

application under section 5 except that such person may establish that he

is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid."

The provisions of Section 9 of the Act have been considered in several

judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court.12 In Nirmal Paper Converters

(Pvt) limited vs Sri lanka Ports Authority13 it was held as follows:

"the only ground on which the petitioner is entitled to remain on this land

is upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State as laid down

in section 9 (1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. He cannot

contest any of the other matters."

The above position has been confirmed in Aravindakumar vs Alwis and

others14 where Sisira De Abrew J [with Sripavan J (as he then was) agreeing]

has held as follows:

"According to the scheme provided in the Act a person who is in

possession or occupation of any state land and has been served with quit

12 See Herath vs Morgan Engineering (Pvt) Limited [SC Appeal No. 214/2012 - SC Minutes of 2ih June 2013 -Judgment of Sripavan J (as he then was)]; Muhandiram vs Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estates Development

Board [1992 1 Sri LR 110).

131993 1 Sri LR 219.

142007 1 Sri LR 316.

10

notice under Section 3 of the Act can continue to be in possession or

occupation of the land only upon a valid permit or other written authority

of the State described in Section 9 of the Act."

The Act makes it clear that if the land in question is State land, and the person

in possession is unable to show a valid permit or other written authority of the

State issued in terms of any written law to possess the said land, the State is

entitled to issue a quit notice seeking to eject the person in illegal occupation,

from the said land and, if the said quit notice is not complied with, to make an

application in terms of the Act to eject such person.

In this application, there is no dispute that the land in question is State land

and that the Petitioner has no valid permit or other written authority in

respect of Lot No. 782. This is a classic case where the provisions of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act could be invoked by issuing a quit notice.

Thus, this Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent acted within the

provisions of the Act when he issued the quit notices 'p26' and 'P27' on the

Petitioner and thereafter filed action when the Petitioner did not comply with

the said quit notices. The action of the 1st Respondent is therefore clearly not

illegal.

If that be the case, what is the basis of the present application? The Petitioner

is not complaining of any irrationality or procedural impropriety in respect of

the said quit notice 'P27'. The Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash

'P27' on the basis that she had a legitimate expectation that Lot No. 782 would

be given to her on a permit and therefore the issuing of the quit notice is

11

illegal. The Petitioner is relying on the contents of three letters annexed to the

petition, marked IpiG', 'P17' and 'P24' in support of her argument.

The relevant portions of the three letters relied on by the Petitioner as having

created a legitimate expectation in her mind that a permit would be issued in

her favour are re-produced below:

IpiG' is a letter dated 2nd October 1996 written by the 2nd Respondent

Provincial Land Commissioner of the Uva Province to the 1st Respondent,

Divisional Secretary of Haputale. This letter has not been copied to the

Does any of the letters 'PiG', 'P17' and 'P24' hold out to the Petitioner that she

would be given a permit in respect of Lot No. 782 and if so, can the said letters

give rise to a legitimate expectation?

In Ginigathgala Muhandiramlage Nimalsiri vs Colonel P.PJ. Fernando and

others16, Priyantha Jayawardena J has considered the issue of legitimate

expectation and held as follows:

({An expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is founded upon

a promise or practice by the authority that is said to be bound to fulfil

the expectation. An expectation the fulfilment of which results in the

decision maker making an unlawful decision cannot be treated as a

legitimate expectation. Therefore, the expectation must be within the

powers of the decision-maker for it to be treated as a legitimate

expectation case.

16 [SC FR Application No. 256/2010; SC Minutes of 1ih September 2015].

In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation a

person should prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based

on a promise or an established practice. Thus, the applicability of the

said doctrine is based on the facts and circumstances of each case.

In order to succeed in an application made on the grounds of legitimate

expectation, the expectation must be legitimate. Mistakes, decisions

based on erroneous factual data or illegality cannot be the basis for a

legitimate expectation. A similar view was expressed in Vasana v.

Incorporated Council of Legal Education and Others ( 2004) 1 SLR 154."

As an initial observation, this Court notes that none of the above letters are

addressed to the Petitioner and that only 'P24' has been copied to the

Petitioner. Thus, there is no representation or holding out made to the

Petitioner and these letters are correspondence between Government

departments and public authorities. Be that as it may, 'P24' only requests that

steps be initiated to issue the Petitioner a permit provided she is eligible to

receive a permit. Thus, it is not an unequivocal statement that a permit would

be issued to the Petitioner. 'P17' too states that steps will be taken after the

approval of the 2nd Respondent, is granted in accordance with the relevant

procedure. Thus, no assurance has been given that a permit will be issued.

A citizen of this country cannot have an expectation that State land will be

given to him or her on a permit, without the State authorities following the

due procedure. The Land Development Ordinance contains clear provisions

with regard to the procedure that should be followed when allocating State

14

land among people of this country. While suitable persons are selected

through Land Kachcheris that are held by the Divisional Secretaries and

recommendations are made by the Divisional Secretary through the Provincial

Land Commissioner to the Land Commissioner General, the final decision

whether a permit should be granted needs to be taken by the Land

Commissioner General. Furthermore, in terms of Article 33(2)(f) of the

Constitution, the power "to keep the Public Seal of the Republic, and to make

and execute under the Public Seal ... such grants and dispositions of lands and

other immovable property vested in the Republic as the President is by law

required or empowered to do, and to use the Public Seal for sealing all things

whatsoever that shall pass that Seal" shall be with the President.

What is significant however is that in terms of paragraph 18 of List I (Provincial

Council List) of the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, the powers that have

been given to a Provincial Council in respect of land are as follows:

"18. Land.- Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenure,

transfer and alienation of land, land use, land settlement and land

improvement, to the extent set out in Appendix II."

Appendix II states very clearly as follows:

"State land shall continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of

in accordance with Article 33(d)17 and written law governing this matter.

17 Article 33 has been substituted by Section 5 of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Article 33(2)(f) of the present Constitution is similar to the previous Article 33(d).

15

Subject as aforesaid, land shall be Provincial Council Subject, subject to

the following special provisions:

1. State land -

1:3 Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to

any citizen or to any organisation shall be by the President, on the

advice of the relevant Provincial Council, in accordance with the

laws governing the matter."

In the case of Solaimuthu Rasu vs. Superintendent, Stafford Estate18, the

Supreme Court held as follows:

"Appendix II begins with an unequivocal opener -"State Land shall

continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of, in accordance

with Article 33 (d) and written laws governing the matter." This

peremptory declaration is a pointer to the fact that State Land belongs to

the Republic and not to a Province. The notion of disposition of State Land

in accordance with Article 33 (d) and written laws governing the matter

establishes beyond doubt that dominium over all "State Land" lies with

the Republic and not with the Provincial Councils.

The Supreme Court has thus clarified the power of the Provincial authorities in

respect of alienation of State Land and reinforced the position that State Land

lies within the legislative competence of the Central Government and not

Provincial Councils.

18 SC Appeal No. 21/13; SC Minutes of 26th September 2013.

16

When 'P16' is considered in the light of the above judgment and the provisions

of the Constitution, it is clear that the Provincial Land Commissioner does not

have the power to approve the alienation of State Land as sought to be done

by 'P16'. Furthermore, to hold that the Land Commissioner General and HE the

President are bound by the approval given by the Provincial Land

Commissioner would be contrary to law. Thus, this Court is of the view that the

Provincial Land Commissioner who issued 'P16' did not have the power to

issue the said letter and therefore, this Court, following the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Nimalsiri's case concludes that an illegality cannot be the

basis for a legitimate expectation.

There are three other matters that this Court must advert to. The Petitioner

admits that she entered into the said land in an unauthorized manner by

'purchasing' the rights conferred on Juwanis Appuhamy in terms of the permit

issued to him. Such a course of action is clearly contrary to the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance. Any allocation of the said land to the

Petitioner must be in accordance with the provisions of the said Ordinance.

This Court reiterates that a public servant cannot act outside the law and

illegally hold out to any citizen that a State land will be given to such person.

Therefore, any representation made to the Petitioner outside the law is clearly

illegal and cannot be recognized and given effect to by this Court.

Section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act does not recognize

the right to occupy State Land other than through a valid permit or a written

authority of the State issued in accordance with any written law. This Court

notes that the said three letters relied upon by the Petitioner does not fall into

17

either of the two categories set out in Section 9. Therefore, the action taken by

the 1st Respondent to issue the quit notices 'P26' and 'P27' is not illegal.

This Court must observe that even where an applicant possessed a permit, the

Supreme Court has held19 that such person is only entitled to a hearing prior to

the said permit being withdrawn. The Petitioner in this application was in

unauthorized possession of State land, she never held a permit and no promise

recognized by law has been made to her. Therefore, applying the said decision

of the Supreme Court, the Petitioner would not even be entitled to a hearing,

let alone the issuance of a permit in respect of Lot No. 782.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has

failed to establish that she has an expectation that is legitimate, which may be

enforced and upheld by law. This Court accordingly rejects the Petitioner's

argument that the three letters 'P16', 'P17' and 'P24' gave rise to a legitimate

expectation that a permit will be issued in respect of Lot No. 782. The

application of the Petitioner for a Writ of Certiorari to quash 'P27' is devoid of

any legal basis and is therefore refused by this Court.

The second issue that this Court is required to consider is whether a Writ of

Mandamus could be issued to compel the 1st -3rd Respondents to issue a

permit to the Petitioner in respect of Lot No. 782. In view of the findings of this

Court that the decision to issue a quit notice is not liable to be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari, the necessity to consider a Writ of Mandamus does not

arise. However, for purposes of completeness, this Court would consider

19 See Sundarkaran v Bharathi and others 1989 (1) Sri LR 46.

18

whether a Writ of Mandamus can be issued to give effect to the legitimate

expectation that the Petitioner claims to have.

It has been consistently held by our Courts20 that the foundation of Mandamus

is the existence of a legal right to a statutory duty. Where the applicant has

sufficient legal interest and the officials have a public duty but have failed to

perform such duty, a Writ of Mandamus wi" lie to secure the performance of

the said duty. However, a Writ of Mandamus is not intended to create a right

but rather to restore a party who has been denied enjoyment of the said right.

This Court has already held that State land can only be alienated in accordance

with the law and that the Petitioner has not demonstrated her entitlement to

receive a permit in respect of Lot No. 782. Furthermore, there is no public legal

duty on the part of the Respondents to grant a permit to the Petitioner outside

the law. In the above circumstances, this Court does not see a legal basis to

issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed for.

The application of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
