01. This is an appeal preferred by the Plaintiff Appellant (Appellant) against the

Judgment of the learned District Judge of Negombo dated 21.11.2000.

Appellant filed the above action in the District Court of Negombo praying

for a declaration that deed No.980 dated 19.06.1993 executed by H.P.A.

Rupasinghe, Notary Public is null and void and that the said deed is not the

act and deed of the Appellant, and that the above deed does not convey title

to the Defendant Respondent (Respondent) of the portion of the land

described in the schedule to the plaint. The Appellant's case was based on

2

the ground that the Respondent fraudulently misrepresented to the Appellant

that he was getting a lease of the portion of the land.

02. Version of the Appellant is that, the Respondent requested the land in

question to be given to him on a lease for 05 years for him to grow

pineapples. He had agreed to give it on lease for 05 years for a sum of Rs.

8000/-. On 19.06.1993 he had gone to the Notary's office with the

Respondent to sign the lease agreement. He had been after consuming

alcohol and on their way to the Notary also he had consumed more alcohol

that the Respondent bought. At the Notary's office after the Respondent had

a discussion with the Notary, his signature was obtained on few papers. He

had signed under the belief that he is signing on a lease agreement. Notary

had not explained the contents to him. He had received Rs. 8000/= upon

signing the documents.

03. On 24.06.1993, the Respondent had tried to erect a fence in the land and on

inquiring, the Respondent had said that he bought this land outright. On

further inquiring from the Notary, he has got to know that it was on a deed

of sale he had signed.

04. Respondent's version is that, he never wanted to get the land on lease to

grow pineapples. Respondent himself had been a co-owner of the land.

According to the Respondent, about 6 months prior to signing of the deed in

question, the Appellant had asked him to buy the undivided portion of his

land and he had agreed to buy it for Rs. 25,000/-. Before signing the deed, he

had given Rs. 17,000/- to the Appellant. On that agreement between the

parties, on 19.06.1993, the deed in question was signed and attested by the

Notary. The balance Rs. 8,000/- was paid to the Appellant at Notary's office

at the time of signing the deed. Respondent says that there was no

( 3

misrepresentation or fraud. He denied that the Appellant was consuming

alcohol and said that the Appellant came to the Notary on his own. He says

that after signing the deed, the Appellant had made this complaint on the

instigation of the Appellant's son.

05. At the trial, the Appellant, his wife, his son and his brother had given

evidence on behalf of the Appellant. On behalf of the Respondent,

Respondent, the Notary, two witnesses who witnessed signing of the deed

and one G.A.M. Gunaratne had testified in the District Court. After trial the

learned District Judge delivering the judgment on 21.11.2000 dismissed the

plaintiff s action.

06. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant preferred the instant

appeal on 14 grounds. Although there are 14 grounds of appeal mentioned in

the petition of appeal, those grounds can be summarized into three.

1. That the judgment of the learned District Judge is contrary to law and the

weight of the evidence led at the trial.

2. That the Respondent has failed to prove that the attesting of the deed in

question was in compliance with Section 02 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance.

3. That the long delay of about 04 years for the learned District Judge to

deliver the judgment, there was all possibility that the learned District

Judge forgetting the demeanour of the witnesses.

07. Counsel for the Appellant filed written submissions. However, the

Respondent neither filed written submissions, nor he represented himself or

by counsel at the argument stage of this appeal. Counsel for the Appellant

agreed to dispose this appeal by way of the written submissions already filed

4

without going to oral argument. I have considered the pleadings, evidence

adduced at the trial, judgment of the learned District Judge, grounds of

appeal, and the submission made by counsel for the appellant.

08. When fraud is alleged in signing of a deed, in a Civil Court it would require

a higher degree of probability although it does not adopt the standard of

proof beyond reasonable doubt.

09. In case of Kumarasinghe V. Dinadasa and Others [2007J 2 Sri L.R. page

203 it was held;

, ... A civil Court when considering a charge of fraud requires a

higher degree of probability than it would require in establishing

negligence. '

10. In case of Peiris and Another V. Siripala [2009J 1 Sri L.R. page 75 at page

83, Court of Appeal held;

'In Sri Lanka the earlier view was that the burden of proving

fraud in regard to a civil transaction must be satisfied beyond

reasonable doubt (vide Yoosoof V Rajaratnam 74 N.l.R. at page 9).

But the law as it stands today is that the standard of proof remains on

a balance of probabilities although the more serious the imputation,

the stricter is the proof which is required. (Associated Battery

Manufacturers Ltd. V United Engineering Workers Union 77 N.L.R.

541)'.

On the above line of authorities, it is clear that in proving a fraud in a civil

transaction, although the standard of proof is balance of probabilities a strict

proof is required.

11. The position of the Appellant was that he was misled or tricked as he had

consumed alcohol. Although he said that the Notary did not explain the

contents of the document he signed, in cross examination he admitted that

the Notary read the contents to him. (Page 72 of the record).

C: ::Z)G'<:.:)elDJ C) G'l5l'6c2Zf 25111$)1.

12. Other than his own evidence, there is no evidence to show that he had

consumed alcohol. The Respondent, notary and the witnesses to the deed

testified about signing of the deed and they had not noticed that the

Appellant was drunk.

13. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence of the witnesses for

the Respondent should be disregarded as they were coached by the

Respondent. The witnesses admitted that they came to Court with the

Respondent to give evidence and that they discussed about the case. It is

quite natural for the witnesses in a civil case to come together to court and

also to discuss about the case. On that point they have been truthful to Court.

What is important is to see whether they were not truthful about the incident

of signing of the deed in question or whether they lied to Court in favour of

the Respondent.

14. The learned District Judge found that the evidence of the Appellant could

not be accepted. It was evident that the wife and the son of the Appellant

were not even aware of the Appellant going and signing the deed, whether it

was a transfer deed or a lease agreement. In paragraph 07 of the plaint,

Appellant averred that at the Notary's office he signed on few papers. (0009

15. However, his evidence in Court was that he signed only on one paper (page

57 of the record). Appellant's evidence on signing of the deed was also not

consistent. In her judgment the learned District Judge has properly analyzed

the evidence of all witnesses and had given good and sufficient reasons for

her conclusion. As the witnesses testified before the learned District Judge, it

was the trial Judge who heard and saw the demeanour and deportment of the

witnesses. Unless there are serious infirmities in the evidence that were not

considered by the trial judge, an appellate court will be slow in interfering

with the Trial Judge's decision on the credibility of the witnesses. In case of

Fradd V. Brown & Company Ltd. (20 N.L.R. page 282) Privy Council

held;

"It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit,

upon a point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal,

because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a

Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with

any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or

from narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in

question of veracity, so direct and so specific as these, a Court of

Appeal will over-rule a Judge of first instance'

16. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Respondent was not consistent

in his evidence with regard to his going to the Notary's office. It is clear

from the evidence that the position taken by the Respondent from the

inception was that the Appellant and the Respondent went separately to the

Notary's office. It seems that Appellant is trying to misinterpret what the

Respondent said in his evidence at page 98, taking it in isolation, that he

7

went to Notary with Plaintiff. In the next page at page 99, the Respondent

has clearly explained as to how Appellant was already at Notary's office

when he went there.

17. Although it was not pursued at the argument of the appeal, in the petition of

appeal it was urged that there had been a long delay in delivering the

judgment by learned District Judge and therefore, the learned District Judge

may have forgotten the demeanour of the witnesses. Having scrutinized the

evidence and the Judgment, I am of the view that the learned District Judge

has considered all the evidence and that no prejudice has caused to the

parties because of the delay in delivering the judgment.

In the above premise I find that the grounds of appeal are without merit and

appeal should be dismissed.

Hence, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
