M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent instituted the above styled action in the District

Court of Galle seeking to have the land called Ambagahakoratuwewatta

alias Ambagahawatta, partitioned amongst the Plaintiff 1/24 shares, 1st

Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) 23/24 shares

on the pedigree pleaded in the plaint (vide page 54 of the appeal brief).

Licensed Surveyor G. N. Samarasingha prepared the Preliminary Plan No. 696

(available at page 85) and submitted same together with the report. In Plan

No. 696, the Surveyor had shown the corpus in 2 lots namely Lot A and B. At

the time of the Preliminary Survey of the land subjected to in this case, and

new claimant, 3rd Defendant-Respondent claimed a part of the land before the

Commissioner. Accordingly, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent made an

application to intervene and then she was added as the 3rd Defendant to the

action.

Its further revealed that the Appellant had claimed plantation and building in

Lot B, and the 3rd Defendant had claimed certain plantation and buildings in

Lot A, however, the 2nd Defendant-Respondent had claimed rights against the

3

said 3rd Defendant-Respondent with regard to the said plantation and

building.

It was in those circumstances, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent in her Statement

of Claim, stated that lot A in preliminary plan not from part of the corpus and

it is the land called Para Rathmehera Delgahakoratuwa alias Rathmehera

Delgahakoratuwa belonging to the 3rd Defendant and also that the said land

is the subject matter of an another action bearing No. 10423/L pending in the

same District Court. Thereafter, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent had set out her

pedigree in respect of her alleged land. She in her statement of claim sought a

commission to be issued on to G.H.P.A.A. de Silva Licensed Surveyor to

prepare a plan superimposing Plan 343 (prepared in Case No. 10423) on the

preliminary plan filed of record in the present case. Accordingly, on a

commission issued in the case, said Licensed Surveyor prepared the Plan No.

1028 dated 24.05.1988 and submitted same with the report.

Thereafter, the case was fixed for trial on 16 issues raised by parties. After

conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge on 16.10.1998 delivered the

judgment excluding Lot A in the preliminary plan from the corpus and made

order to partition the land restricting the corpus only to Lot B in preliminary

plan.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, this appeal preferred by the Appellant

to set aside that part of the judgment which had excluded Lot A from the

corpus and allow the appeal to include Lot A in preliminary plan in to the

corpus.

4

In this case, the only dispute between parties was whether Lot A in

preliminary plan is a part of the corpus or should it be excluded from the

present partition action.

In the District Court, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent stated that the Appellant

had transferred an undivided 10 Perches of land to the Plaintiff-Respondent

by Deed No. 248 dated 22.07.1984 (P16); within 2 weeks of the

aforementioned transfer, on 03.08.1984 the Plaintiff-Respondent instituted

this action citing only the Appellant and the 2nd Defendant-Respondent as

Defendants without naming the 3rd Defendant-Respondent.

It is seen from the said Plan No. 343 that the boundaries of the Lot A, are very

clear. Whereas the southern boundary is a live wire fence, the 3rd Defendant

had stated that the trees on the fence had been cut down by the Appellant,

and the Police had inquired into the matter. She further stated that, there is

no boundary within this allotment as claimed by the Appellant. Therefore, she

has taken up a position that this property had been possessed as a single unit

(vide pages 448 and 449).

Therefore, its quite clear from the said judgment of the District Court, the

learned District Judge carefully concentrated an important fact that said Lot A

in preliminary plan is not a part of the corpus in the present case, by

answering points of contest Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the 3rd Defendant-

Respondent, learned Trail Judged has declared that the said lot A in

preliminary plan forms part of the land called Para Rathmehera

Delgahakoratuwa alias Rathmehera Delgahakoratuwa as claimed by the 3rd

Defendant-Respondent that said land consist of Lot A and C in plan 1028

prepared by G.H.G.A.A. de Silva Licensed Surveyor.

5

After careful perusal of the oral and documentary evidence of this case, this

Court of the view that the learned District Judge correctly held with the 3rd

Respondent and ordered to partitioned the land excluding Lot A from the

corpus, for reaching this conclusion he correctly evaluate the relevant Survey

Plans which were submitted by both parties.

In the circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Trail

judge. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the appeal without costs.

Appeal dismissed.
