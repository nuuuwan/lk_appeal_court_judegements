Plaintiff~ ResponClent

Decided on 10.08.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted this action seeking a declaration of title described as Lot 4 of

Klukondewatta alias Kaluikandewatta and the boutiqu~ room standing thereon

more fully described in paragraph 2 of the plaint. The Plaintiff averred that he

was the owner of a half share of the corpus and the other half share had belonged

to his brother U dugama Gamage Sagaris who later transferred his rights in the

half share to the plaintiff by a deed bearing No 45108 of lIth July 1985 and thus he

became the owner of the entirety of the corpus.

The Plaintiff~ Respondent- -further stated in his plaint that in 1983, he permitted

the Defendant Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendant) to

construct a boutique room on the said land and thereafter be terminated the leave

and licence. Notwithstanding the said termination of the leave and licence, the

Defendant stayed put on the land and thus was in wrongful and unlawful

occupation of the corpus.

The Defendant Appellant filing answer admitted that Udugama Gamage Sagaris

was the owner of a half sHare of the corpus, who had also promised to transfer

his share to him. The Defendant for the stated in his answer that he had paid the

said Sagaris a sum of Rs 8,000 and it was upon the promise of Sagaris to transfer

the property, he constructed a boutique room thereon at a cost of Rs 29,000 and

thereafter spend a further sum of Rs 1I,000 to obtain electricity, and as such he

claimed Rs 40,000 as compensation on the basis that he was a bona fide

improver. There were two admissions that were recorded at the trial namely the

corpus and the fact that Sagaris had transferred his share to John~the Plaintiff

Respondent.

At the trial, only the Plaintiff Respondent as well as the Defendant Appellant

gave evidence for their respective cases. By a judgement dated 6th November

1996,the learned Additional District Judge of Galle delivered his judgement in

favour of the Plaintiff Respondent, whilst ordering a sum of Rs 10,000 to be paid

to the Defendant Appellant for the improvement that he had made on the land.

The learned Additional District Judge though subjected this sum of Rs 10,000 to

be deducted for the damages that that the Plaintiff had sought.

Aggrieved by this judgment, the Defendant has preferred this appeal. The

argument before this Court of the respective Councel for the parties principally

focused on the question as to who had given leave and licence to the defendant

to construct a boutique room in one corner of the land as it was described. The

variance between the par :ies as to the au thor of the lea ve and licence emerged in

the pleadings themselves. Whilst the Plaintiff averred that it was him who had

given the leave and licence to the Defendant, the Defendant pleaded in his answer

dated 26th February 1993 that it was Sagaris (the brot her of the Plaintiff) who , had given the leave and licence.

In paragraph 6 (a) of the answer, the Defendant referred to the leave and licence

and stated that he had given Sagaris Rs 8, 000 for that purpose. In fact paragraph

6 of the answer spoke of an oral agreement between Sagaris and the Defendant

wherein apart from the above leave and licence, the verbal agreement, according

to the Defendant, include(~ a covenant to the effect that Sagaris had agreed to

transfer his half share to tht Defendant in the future provided the Defendant paid

some more consideration. This paragraph crystallized into Issue No 13 which the

learned Additional District Judge answered in the negative. In other words as to

the issue whether there was an oral agreement between Sagaris and the

Defendant embodying the above covenants, the answer of the learned Additional

District Judge was that th~re was no such oral agreement. To put it in another '. way, the learned Additi01!.al District Judge disbelieved the Defendant on his

( assertion that it was Sagaris who had given the leave and licence. According to

the learned Additional District Judge, it was the Plaintiff who had given the leave

and license. Is this finding right?

The evidence discloses the two conflicting versions of the leave and licence. The

Plaintiff said that the leaVt~ and licence was his, but the Defendant attributed it , to Sagaris. There is evidence on the record that Sagaris passed away in 1994. The

defendant's list of witnesE:b was filed in 1993. One finds Sagaris absent from this

list of witnesses. If the Defendant was intending to prove that Sagaris was his

licensor, Sagaris did not find himself in the lii't of witnesses filed by the

defendant. This shows that the Defendant was not even intending to establish

the identity of his licensor. On the contrary, when the Plaintiff asserted in his

evidence that he was the licensor Of the Defendant, this evidence was not

L challenged at all. One is reminded of the perennial dictum of B.N.G. Fernando

C.J. in EdrickdeSilva vs. Chandradasa de Silva. (1967) 70 N.L.R.169 at 174.

"where a plaintiff ho. s, in a civil case, led evidence sufficient in law to prove a factum

probandum, the failure of the defendant to adduce evidence which contradicts it adds a

new factor in favour Qj the Plaintiff There is then an additional 'matter before the

court', which the defi'ni:tion in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the Court

l to take into account, 'namely that the evidence led by the plaintiff is uncontradicted" ~

In fact when the Plaintiff declared in his evidence that it was him who gave the

leave and licence, there was no serious challenge posed to this evidence, just like

his title was admitted as a formal admission at the beginning of the trial. In fact

in cross~examination the p~aintiff asserted that Sagaris objected to any leave and

licence being given to the Defendant. Sagaris had berated him for letting the

Defendant onto the land. This evidence remained unchallenged.

In the teeth of this evidence, the Defendant should have led rebutting evidence

of the stances taken up bY,the Plaintiff. By the time Karunadasa (the Defendant)

" I ' took the witness stand in 1996, the so called licensor Sagaris had already crossed

the great divide and except the mere ipse dixit of the befendant, there was no

evidence available to corroborate him that it was Sagaris who had given leave

and licence. It was in this backdrop that the learned Additional District Judge

concluded that it was John Appu (the Plaintiff) who had given leave and licence.

I find no reason to disturb this finding. "i

There is also evidence of termination of the said leave 'and licence spoken to by

the Plaintiff. At page 48 of the Appeal Brief there is sufficient evidence to

establish that the Plaintiff terminated the leave and licence and requested the

Defendant to quit the bnd. Subsequent police complaints in respect of the.

refusal of the Defendant to quit the land have also been marked in evidence.

There is thus evidence of a cause of action that had acclued to the Plaintiff to sue

the Defendant in ejectment.

Once a Plaintiff establishes himself as the licensor of the Defendant, a declaration

of title action ensues to sue the licensee in ejectment~see Pathirana v.

Jayasundera 58 NLR 169 (H.N.G. Fernando J and Gratiaen J) and Jamaldeen

Abdul Latheef and Another v. Abdul Majeed Mohamed Mansoor and

Another (2010) 2 Sri.LR 333 (MarsoofJ). Title is irreh~vant in these actions~see

Ruberu and Another v.' Wijesooriya_[1998] 2 SRI LR at p 58 (U. De Z.

GunawardanaJ 1

The Defendant began to refer to the leave and licence allegedly granted by

Sagaris. By the time the IJefendant took the witness stand to testify for himself,

Sagaris had passed awayc.md there was nothing to corroborate the Defendant.

I On appeal, the whole cas,~ including the facts is within the jurisdiction of the

appellate court. But, generally speaking, it is undesirable to interfere with the

findings of the fact of the trial judge who saw and heard the witness and had an

opportunity of noting their demeanor, especially in cases where the issue is

simple and depends on the credibility which attaches to one or the other of

conflicting witnesses. The appellate court ordinarily cannot change the evidence

recorded in the trial court in civil cases. The burden of showing that the

judgment appealed from iswTong, lies upon the appellant. If all that he can show

is nicely balanced calcu1.ations, which lead to the equal possibility of the

judgment on either the one side or the other being right, he has not succeeded.

But in the case before me the probability of the leave and licence being given by

the Plaintiff is greater having regard to the evidence so I affirm the finding that

the Plaintiff was the licensor of the Defendant and ther? was proof of termination

of this license.

Leave and licence~Shoulii it be notarially executed? .

In the course of the argument, Mr. Mahinda Nanayakkara for the Defendant-

Appellant brought forth a novel argument namely there must be proof that leave

and licence must be in accordance with Section 2 of the Prevention of Fraud

Ordinance. Mr, Athula ?erera opposed this argument strenuously and

contended that this is a mtxed question of fact and law and therefore this cannot

be raised for the first timcin appeal. But Mr. Mahinda Nanayakkara argued that

he was raising this in appeal as it was a pure question of law. His argument was

that in the event of this Court holding that the PlaintIff gave leave and licence,

that leave and licence is null and void because it has not been notrailly attested.

In my view the answer to this question lies in Section 2 of the Prevention of Fraud

Ordinance itself.

1.'

Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance which may be called the

palladium of our conveyancing law lays down the general rule as to the

formalities required for the transfer of Immovable Property.

Section 2 of the Preventicn of Frauds Ordinance, state,s the following:

"No sale, purchase, transfer, assignment, or mortgage of land or other immovabl~

property, and no promise, bargain, contract or agreement for effecting any such object

or for establishing any security, interest, or encumbrance affecting land or other

immovable property.~ ........ shall be of force or avail in law unless the same shall be in

writing and signed by the party making the same, or by some person lawfully authorized

by him or her in the p'~esence of a licensed notary and two or more witnesses present at

the same time, and unless the execution of such writing, deed, or instrument be duly

attested by such notary and witnesses".

If I may dissect the section and set them down conveniently it will look thus:

a. Purchase and sale tlf immovable property.

h. Transfer thereof.

c. Assignment of suc~property.

d. Mortgage thereof.

e. Promise, bargain, contract or agreement for effecting any of the above

objects.

f. Promise, bargain, contract or agreement for establishing any security,

interest or encumbrance affecting immovable property.

g. Contract or agreement for the future sale or purchase of immovable , property.

None of the above transactions will be of force or avail in law unless the following

requirements are satisfied:~

a. The instrument must be in writing,

h. It must be signed either by: 1. the party making the same or

2. some person lawfully authorized by such

party.

c. It must be signed in the presence of a licensed Notary Public and two or

more witnesses.

d. Such Notary Public and witnesses must be present at the same time.

e. The execution of the instrument must be duly attested by the notary and

witnesses-Emalia rernando v. Caroline Fernal1do 59 N.L.R. 341.

As the above provision quite clearly shows, no formalities are required to

establish a bare or contractual licence. The formality rules contained in Section

2 focus solely on the conferral of a right in rem in the land, or a contract or

agreement to confer such a right. Licenses are not rights in rem at all. Licenses

comprise those consensual rights in personam-see dicta to this effect in

Pathirana v. Jayasundera 58 NLR 169 (H.N.G. Fernando J and Gratiaen J) and

Jamaldeen Abdul Lathcef al1d Another v. Abdul M:ifeed Mohamed Mansoor

'-; and Al10ther (2010) 2 Sri LR 333 (MarsoofJ).

In King v David ADen ;;.nd Sons Billposting Ltd (1916) 2 AC 54 and Clore v

Theatrical Properties ltd (1936) 3 All ER 483, the House of Lords and Court

of Appeal respectively treated contractual licenses as rights in personam. They

just give the right to be on someone's land and certainly they cannot be equated

as an interest in the land. Ip the circumstances I hold that leave and licence need

not be notarially attested' and so I would affirm the judgement of the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle and allow the reliefs sought by the Plaintiff-

Respondent. The order of compensation made by Court for improvements in

favor of the Defendant is affirmed.

So I would dismiss the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant .
