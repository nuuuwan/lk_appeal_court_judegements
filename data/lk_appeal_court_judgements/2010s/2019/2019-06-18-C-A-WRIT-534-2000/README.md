The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari quashing (a) the decision of the Respondents jointly

and severally to acquire the land referred to in document marked P7A and (b) the decision of the

pt Respondent published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1123/13 of 15.03.2000 marked P7A. It is

an order made under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act as amended (Act).

Page 2 of 8

The main ground upon which the writs are sought is that there is no section 2 order made in

terms of the Act for the land acquired prior to the making of the order under proviso (a) to Section

38 of the Act. It is not in dispute between the parties that a section 2 Order was made under the

Act (PS). The dispute is whether PS covers the land falling within the order made under proviso

(a) to Section 38 of the Act.

Before examining this issue in depth, it is apposite to examine the procedure laid down in the Act

in acquiring land for a public purpose.

Purpose of a Section 2 Notice under the Act

Section 2 of the Act reads:

"2. (1) Where the Minister decides that land in any area is needed for any public

purpose, he may direct the acquiring officer of the district in which that area lies

to cause a notice in accordance with subsection (2) to be exhibited in some

conspicuous places in that area.

(2) The notice referred to in subsection (1) shall be in the Sinha la, Tamil and English

languages and shall state that land in the area specified in the notice is required

for a public purpose and that all or any of the acts authorized by subsection (3)

may be done on any land in that area in order to investigate the suitability of that

land for that public purpose.

(3) After a notice under subsection (2) is exhibited for the first time in any area, any

officer authorized by the acquiring officer who has caused the exhibition of that

notice, or any officer acting under the written direction of the officer authorized

as aforesaid, may enter any land in that area, together with such persons,

implements, materials, vehicles and animals as may be necessary, and

(a) survey and take levels of that land,

(b) dig or bore into the subsoil of that land,

Page 3 of 8

(c) set out the boundaries of that land and the intended line of any

work proposed to be done on that land,

(d) mark such levels, boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting

trenches,

(e) where otherwise the survey of that land cannot be completed and

such levels taken and such boundaries and line marked, cut down

and clear away any part of any standing crop, fence or jungle on

that land, and

(f) do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether that land is

suitable for the public purpose for which land in that area is

required:

Provided that no officer, in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by

the preceding provisions of this subsection, shall enter any occupied

building or any enclosed court or garden attached thereto unless he has

given the occupier of that building at least seven days' written notice of his

intention to do so.

Section 2(1} of the Act is the beginning of a process through which land can be acquired for a

public purpose. It first envisages the Minister making a decision that land in any area is needed

for a public purpose. Once the Minister so decides, a notice in accordance with Section 2(2} of

the Act must be exhibited. After such notice is exhibited for the first time, any officer authorized

by the acquiring officer may enter any land in that area and to any of the acts referred to in

Section 2(3} of the Act. Thus, the acts that can be done in terms of a Section 2(1} notice are of an

investigatory nature.

It is in this context that in Edirisinghe v. Minister of Lands and another [(CA. Application No.

2543/2004; Decided on 16.10.2006] Sriskandarajah J. held as follows (at page 4):

"The Minister of Lands under Section 2 directs the acquiring officer to investigate

by publishing a notice under Section 2 whether the land identified is suitable for

Page 4 of 8

the said public purpose. The direction of the Minister under Section 2 or the act

of the acquiring officer under this section is not a decision affecting the rights of a

person but an investigation leads to a recommendation to the Minister that the

said land is either suitable or not for the said purpose. "

In Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and Others [(S.C. Appeal No. 85/2008 and

101/2008; Decided on 01.06.2009] after an exhaustive analysis of the scheme of the Act, S.N.

Silva c.J. stated thus (at page 6):

"The process of acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act commences upon a

decision made by the Minister in terms of section 2(1) that land in any area is

needed for a public purpose. This decision gets narrowed to a particular land or a

particular servitude which is suited for the public purpose when the Minster

makes a direction to the Acquiring Officer in terms of Section 4(1). Thereafter the

Act provides for the various steps in the acquisition of such land or servitude

including notices being served on the owner and another being exhibited in a

conspicuous place on or near the land. A person having an interest in the land or

servitude to be acquired is provided an opportunity in terms of Section 4(4) of the

Act to object to such acquisition. The Secretary of the appropriate Ministry for

which the land is acquired directs an inquiry into the objections and makes a

recommendation to the Minster on the objections that have been made.

Thereupon a firm decision is made by the Minister in respect of the acquisition by

a declaration under Section 5(1) which is published in the gazette and exhibited

on or near the land. In terms of section 5(2) this declaration is conclusive evidence

that the land is required for a public purpose ... "

Accordingly, our courts have held that it is not possible to quash a section 2 notice issued under

the Act by way of a writ of certiorari [Dayaratne v. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands and

Others (2006) 1 SrLL.R. 7].

Page 5 of 8

Therefore, the Act contemplates a section 2 notice to cover a larger AREA while the order made

under the proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act can cover a smaller LAND within that AREA.

The Area/Lands covered by PS and P7/P7A

In the instant matter the section 2 notice (PS) identifies an area in extent of 40 acres (18.18

Hectares) of the land called {(Old Janawasama Land". The section 38(a) order (P7 /P7 A) covers an

area of 13.6739 Hectares.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the land identified in the section 2 notice

is in the Gajabapura Division of the Eadella Estate whereas the land set out in the order made in

terms of proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act forms part of Suriyapura Division of the Eadella

Estate.

The Petitioner seeks to establish that the areas covered by PS and P7/P&A are different by relying

on a sketch marked P6 which seeks to identify the Gajabapura Division and Suriyapura Division

of the Eadella Estate. This is just a sketch and does not reveal as to who made it. Section 3 of the

Surveyors Ordinance [which was the applicable law when this application was filed] prohibits the

reception of such documents as evidence in any civil court. In any event it lacks any evidentiary

value.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the 2nd Respondent, Divisional Secretary,

Rambukkana, had admitted its contents. It is true that the 2nd Respondent had at paragraph 6 of

his affidavit admitted the contents of document {(P6" but he goes onto state that he is {(unaware

whether the said land form part of the Gajabapura Division of Eadella Estate". More importantly,

the 2nd Respondent has, at paragraph 8 of his affidavit, stated that {(the land described in the

notice published under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act is included in the

land referred to in the notice published under section 2 of the said Act".

Page 6 of 8

In any event, I am of the view that the following facts corroborate that the land described in

P7 /P7 A is in fact part of the larger area described in P5:

(a) The Advance Tracing Plan and Tenement List prepared by the Surveyor General (lR16)

clearly show that the Divisional Secretary's reference number and the Land Ministry's

reference number contained in P5 are the same. In fact, these reference numbers

continue throughout the entire acquisition process without any alteration.

(b) The Advance Tracing Plan and Tenement List prepared by the Surveyor General (lR16)

refer to a land in extent of 13.6738 Hectares out of a total extent of 18.13 Hectares set

out in the section 2 notice which indicates that the section 38(a) order was made for a

portion of the area set out in P5.

(c) K.A. Harischandra, the then Grama Niladhari of Marukwatura Division (750) has affirmed

the affidavit marked lRl0 and he is the person who pointed out the boundaries when the

survey was done. This is reflected in the last column of the Tenement List lR16.

The above facts together with the presumption in section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance

further establishes that the land described in the notice published under proviso (a) to Section

38 of the Act is included in the land referred to in the notice published under section 2 of the Act.

Section 5 Order

The pt Respondent has issued a declaration under section 5 of the Act that the land in dispute is

required for a public purpose (lR15). Hence the question of whether the land in dispute is

required for a public purpose cannot be questioned by this Court now. Section 5(2) of the Act

makes it conclusive and takes it out of the scope of judicial review. [Fernandopul/e vs. Minister of

Land and Agriculture (79(11) N.L.R. 115), Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and Others

(S.c. Appeal No. 85/2008 and 101/2008; S.C.M. 01.06.2009 at page 11, 12].

Therefore, even if it is established that the land identified in P7 /P7 A does not fall within the area

covered by the section 2 notice this Court cannot quash P7 /P7 A on the basis that it is not required

for a public purpose as claimed by the Petitioner.

Page 7 of 8

Urgency

The only question this Court can inquire into is whether there is an "urgency" compelling the

immediate possession being taken of the land forming the subject matter of this application. In

Fernandopul/e vs. Minister of Land and Agriculture [79(11) N.L.R. 115] the Supreme Court held that

while an order by the Minister under the proviso to section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act can be

made only in cases of urgency, it is however a matter for a Petitioner who seeks the remedy by

way of Certiorari, to satisfy the Court that there was in fact no urgency and his application

cannot succeed should he fail to do so. (emphasis added). Hence the burden of proof was on the

Petitioner to adduce evidence that there was no urgency and if he fails to do so, his application

must be dismissed.

The Petitioner has failed to do so in this application. On the contrary the documentation before

Court clearly establishes that there was an urgent need as the 2nd Pinnawela ZOO had been given

land belonging to Wagolla Farm and it was necessary to locate the activities of Wagolla Farm

without delay.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed with costs.
