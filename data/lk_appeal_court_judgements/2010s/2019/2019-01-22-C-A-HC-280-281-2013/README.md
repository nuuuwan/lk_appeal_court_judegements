****************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The 2nd Accused-Appellant and 3rd Accused-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the 1st Appellant and 2nd Appellant respectively) have

individually appealed against their conviction and sentence imposed by

the High Court of Colombo. The two Appellants were indicted along with

the 1st Accused for conspiracy to commit murder of Weerahennedige

Nandasena during the period commencing from 8th September 2003 and

ending with 9th September 2003. The 1st Appellant was also indicted for

murder of the said deceased as the 2nd count on the said indictment while

the 2nd Appellant was indicted for abetment of the said murder.

2

After trial without a jury, the trial Court in its impugned judgment,

acquitted the 1st Accused on the basis that he was not involved neither in

the commission of the offence of murder of the deceased nor has he

abetted the said murder. The trial Court, however, found him guilty of the

offence of criminal assault or force, punishable under Section 343 of the

Penal Code, when he threatened the witnesses after the murder of the

deceased.

The 1st Appellant sought to challenge his conviction and sentence of

death upon the ground that the prosecution has failed to establish their

case beyond reasonable doubt. The 2nd Appellant's ground of appeal was

the evidence of the prosecution does not reveal that he entertained a

common murderous intention with the 1st Appellant.

Prosecution presented its case primarily on the evidence of the wife

Champika Perera and the son of the deceased Sandaruwan Fenando who

presented eye witness accounts of the sequence of events that led to the

violent death of the deceased.

The deceased was employed as a labourer of Panad ura Government

Hospital and to supplement the family income, operated a small grocery

shop in the front portion of their half completed two storied building in

which they also lived in. The two Appellants are their neighbours who

used to buy grocery items from their shop.

In the evening of 8th September 2003, wife of the 2nd Appellant

bought groceries from the shop at about 7.30 p.m. and only paid Rs. 50.00

when her total bill was Rs. 100.00. The deceased then expressed his

displeasure by stating to the woman that her husband should pay up his

3

old debts. The 2nd Appellant, who thereafter learnt this conversation had

shouted' at the deceased by coming to the grocery.

At about 1.30 a.m. in the same night, Champika heard the 1st

Appellant, who is known to her as "Baba", tapping on their rear door. He

himself identified as II Baba" and wanted to buy a cigarette. The deceased

then gave him a cigarette through a small opening ,of about 1 1/z inches of

the front door. The 1st Appellant then remarked II @Oo!DC;C)o) 8(3)00 @C;~@~

(!)@~)c;, @Qo qloO~II. Sensing trouble, the witness signalled her husband

not to. When the deceased tried to remove the padlock, the two Appellants

forced their way into theJgrocery by kicking on the door. The 1st Appellant

had a manna knife tucked in his back and pulled it out. He then ordered

the deceased to sit on the stairway to the 1st floor while holding the knife.

In spite of witness's plea, the 1st Appellant struck the deceased with the

manna knife and the deceased then ran up the stairs.

When the witness held the 1st Appellant who attempted to ran after

the deceased, the 2nd Appellant intervened and held her by her hair. He

then put her down and put a ligature around her neck with the black cloth

he had used to cover his face up to that point of time. This act of the 2nd

Appellant afforded an opportunity for the witness to identify him. She

said II 000) q8@o (!)oo) q)OC;?" He then put a gag on her and held a manna

knife against her neck.

The 1st Appellant has then shouted at the 2nd Appellant II @)6)oo)

60~". Hearing this command, the deceased turned back, and he was then

struck on his neck with the manna knife by the 1st Appellant. After the

attack on his neck, the deceased fell down crashing a glass sheet in the

4

process. At that time, her two sons have held on to the 2nd Appellant

pleading with him not to kill their mother. The 2nd Appellant then

loosened his grip on her by stating that" G qoC) C3moCl ~O)d (5)5 ~G:)C)

~ tS)@lG:)o!D 8)0) qe> q5o!DC) ".

Thereafter, the two appellants have left the shop. The witness

shouted for help and only her parents, who lived n~arby, have responded.

Her son, Sandaruwan gave evidence consistent with his mother.

It is the evidence of the medical expert that the deep cut injury on

the neck of the deceased has severed cervical vertebra the carotid artery,

I jugular vein, trachea and spinal cord and thereby resulting the death of the

deceased, in a very short time interval. Of the 10 external injuries that were

seen on the body there were several "defensive injuries" noted by the

medical expert as spoken to by the lay witnesses.

During the investigations, the 1st Appellant was arrested in the night

of the 9th of September 2003 at Jayanthipura, Polonnnaruwa and a manna

knife was recovered upon the information provided by him at his house in

Angulana which was covered with a black plastic bag placed near the

boundary fence . .

The 1st Appellant made a statement from the ' dock denying any

involvement in the death of the deceased whilst claiming that there were

rumours that he was having an extra marital affair with the wife of the

deceased. The 1st Appellant, wanting to clarify the situation with the

deceased, had visited the deceased in the night. After ' some time the

deceased screamed that he is trying to murder him and he left the house.

After his arrest the police recovered a knife and a club from his house.

5

The 2nd Appellant gave evidence under oath. He stated that when he

was passing the deceased's house, he heard the cries raised by the

deceased. He had a knife with him. He had then entered their house to

enquire the reason for the commotion. At that time, he saw the 1st

Appellant chasing after the deceased, armed with a manna knife. At that

time Champika fell down at his feet when she ran after the deceased. He

held her by her hair and at that moment the 1st Appellant shouted at him

to "kill her". Thereupon witness Champika stood up with the help of the

2nd Appellant. He also saw the 1st Appellant returning with his knife .

.J The trial Court had considered the evidence of the prosecution as

well as of the Appellants. It had accepted the prosecution evidence as a

truthful and reliable account of the incident that resulted in the death of

the deceased while opting to disbelieve the evidence presented by the

Appellants. This conclusion is justified since the evidence of the

Appellants contained certain claims that had not been put to the

prosecution witnesses during their cross examination.

It had been noted by the trial Court that the evidence of the

prosecution is consistent, probabl~ and the accusation against the

Appellants was made soon after the incident.

We have carefully considered the evidence presented before the trial

Court by the prosecution as well as the Appellants and are of the firm

opinion that the conclusion reached by the trial Court is quite justified

owing to the nature of the evidence presented by the prosecution.

6

The Appellants were convicted of the conspiracy to murder by the

, trial Court. In The King v. M.E.A.Cooray - 51 N.L.R. 433 their Lordships

have clarified the applicable law as follows:-.

"Under our law as it now stands it is the agreement per"'se to

commit or abet a criminal offence which is intended to be

penalised, whether or not an overt follows {he conspiracy. So

long as the existence of the conspiracy can be proved the

common concurrence of minds of more minds than one -

with a view to achieving an object which is an offence under

our law that constitute criminal conspiracy under the Penal

Code."

The evidence placed by the prosecution against the Appellants are

sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they had the common

concurrence of minds and also physical manifestations of such

concurrence. They lured the deceased to let them into his grocery that

night, had the necessary weapons to carry out the individual tasks that

were agreed upon after meticulously planning the attack on the deceased.

The real threat of death posed by the 2nd Appellant on the witness Champika

made the deceased to abandon his attempt to escape his imminent death.

The command by the 1st Appellant to kill the witrless also is a clear

indication that they knew who their target was and the reason given by the

2nd Appellant for his decision to spare the life of Champika reiterates that

prior agreement.

The manner of execution of the fatal attack on the deceased by the 1st

Appellant has proved beyond any doubt as to his intentions. The near

7

. .-------------------------------------------------------------------------~

severance of the neck of the deceased with a manna knife is an act done

with an obvious murderous intention. There is not a single circumstance

before the trial Court to consider the lesser culpability since the intention of

the 1st Appellant was obvious, when he struck on the neck of tbe deceased

with such force to cut the 7th cervical vertebra and several blood vessels,

using a manna knife.

In relation to the count of abetment to murder levelled against the 2nd

Appellant, the applicable legal principle could be found in King v Marshall

51 N.L.R. 157. It was iterated by the Court of Criminal Appeal that:-

/I mere presence 'with the intention of giving aid to the

principal offender was not enough. There must also be the

doing of something, or the illegal omission to do something,

in order to facilitate the commission of the offence by the

principal offender."

When the role played by the 2nd Appellant in the attack that resulted

in the death of the deceased is considered in the light of the above quoted

principle of law and the motive attributed by the prosecution to commit

the murder, it is clear that it was the 2nd Appellant who instigated the 1st

Appellant to engage in this heinous crime over the perceived "insult" of

reminding him of his old debt. He enticed the 1st Appellant to commit

murder over their "friendship". However, in giving evidence he had

opted to hand over total responsibility on the 1st Appellant but the trial

Court had obviously and correctly decided not to believe him.

The 2nd Appellant's conduct during the necessarily fatal attack on

the deceased, more than enough to find him guilty of abetment of murder.

8

,

In view of the above reasoning we are of the firm view that there is

absolutely no merit in the appeal of the Appellants and their appeals ought

to be dismissed.

Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences o(the 1st and

2nd Appellants. The appeals of the 1st and 2nd Appellants stand dismissed.

DEEP ALI WIIESUNDERA, I

I agree.
