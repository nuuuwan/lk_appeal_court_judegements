The Petitioner was served with a quit notice by the 1st Respondent dated 23.08.2011 (P1) under

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act NO.7 of 1979 as amended (Act). The extent set out

therein is 1.5029 Hectares. Upon receipt of the quit notice the Petitioner informed the 1st

Respondent that the land possessed by the Petitioner is different to the land referred to in the

quit notice.

However, the 1st Respondent took further steps under the Act resulting in the learned Magistrate

of Puttalam ordering the eviction of the Petitioner who then moved in revision to the Provincial

High Court holden in Puttalam. The Petitioner withdrew this application reserving the right to

make an application in revision to the proper court apparently in view of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Soloimuttu Rasu v. The Superintendent of Stafford Estate and Two Others [S.c.

Appeal No. 21/2013].

The Petitioner thereafter filed this application on 01.08.2014 seeking the following relief:

(a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the quit notice issued in terms of section 5 of the Act;

(b) Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st Respondent from taking any further steps under the

Act;

(c) Writ of Certiorari quashing the purported decision that the land in question is state land;

(d) Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent not to interfere with Petitioners' lawful

possession of the land in question.

The Petitioner seeks to assail the quit notice on the following grounds:

(i) The land in issue is private land

(ii) The 1st Respondent has only relied on a letter written by the District Surveyors Officer

in forming his opinion

(iii) Petitioner was not given a hearing before the issue of the quit notice

Identity of Land

Th e long title to th e main Act states that it is intended to make provisions for the "Recovery of

possession of State land from persons in unauthorized or unlawful occupation th ereof". The main

Act did not have a definition of what was meant by "unauthorized possession or occupation". It

is in this context that th e decision in Senanayake v. Damunupola [(1982) 2 SrLL.R. 621] was made.

After the decision in Senanayake v. Damunupolo (supra) the main Act was amended by State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1983. One of the amendments was

to include a new definition of the word" unauthorized possession or occupation" to mean

"except possession or occupation upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and includes possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land". In Shiyom v. Officer-in-Charge, Narcotics Bureou ond another

[(2006) 2 Sri. loR. 156] the Supreme Court held that in case of doubt, it is competent to look at

Parliamentary debates on Acts to ascertain the intention of the law.

The Hon. Minister of Land, Land Development and Mahaweli Development during the second

reading of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Bill [Parliamentary Debates,

Volume 24 at pages 1504-5], which was subsequently passed as State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 29 of 1983, specifically stated that the amendment is been moved due to the

decision of the Supreme Court in Senanayake v. Damunupolo (supra) which made it difficult to

recover land belonging to the State and that recourse to existing law to recover possession of

state land was time consuming. Clearly, the intention of the amendment was to provide a swift

and effective procedure by which the State can recover possession of state land instead of

existing procedures.

The legislative longuoge will be interpreted on the ossumption thot the legisloture wos oware of

existing stotutes, the rules of stotutory construction, ond the judiciol decisions ond thot if 0 chonge

occurs in the legislotive longuoge 0 chonge wos intended in legislotive result [N.S. Bindra's

Interpretation of Statutes; 10th ed., page 235]. Therefore, I am of the view that the ratio decidendi

in Senonoyoke v. Domunupolo (supra) is no longer valid.

A competent authority can have recourse to the Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized

possession or occupation of state land including possession or occupation by encroachment upon

state land. Any possession or occupation without "a valid permit or other written authority of the

State granted in accordance with any written law" is unauthorized possession.

A person who has been summoned in terms of section 6 of the Act can only establish that he is

in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. He cannot contest any of the matters stated in the

application made under section 5 of the Act. One of the matters required to be stated in the

Page 3 of 5

application is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of the

competent authority State land. This fact cannot be contested by the person summoned and the

submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the land in issue is private

land is a matter to be decided by a District Court in an action filed under section 12 of the Act. In

an action filed under section 12 of the Act the owner of the land in dispute can get a declaration

against the State that he is the owner of the said land [Sumanawathie v. Han. Attarney-General

and Others (C.A. 994/2000(F), C.A.M. 05.09.2019J.

Hence, a dispute on the identity of the land cannot arise for consideration of the learned

Magistrate. The identity of the land can arise for consideration only to the extent of examining

whether the valid permit or other written authority produced by the party summoned is in

relation to the state land described in the application. Where it is not, the Magistrate must issue

an order of eviction in terms of the Act. In C.A. 1299/87, C.A.M. 14.06.1995, S.N. Silva J. (as he

was then) held that if the case of the party summoned is that he is in occupation of another land,

then he would not be ejected from the land he is in occupation upon a writ that will be issued in

the Magistrate's Court.

In any event, the Petitioner cannot now raise these issues as the learned Magistrate has ordered

eviction. In Oayananda v. Thalwatte [(2001) 2 Sri.L.R. 73J this Court held that the institution of

proceedings in the Magistrates Court in terms of a quit notice is not a determination affecting

legal rights warranting the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari. Further it was held that it was open

for the petitioner to seek to quash the quit notice by way of certiorari when the determination

was made by the 1st Respondent, or to move in Revision at the conclusion of the Magistrates

findings.

I am in respectful agreement with the above statement. The Petitioner withdrew the revision

application filed reserving the right to file a revision application in the appropriate Court. The

Petitioner cannot after nearly three years from the issue of the quit notice seek to assail it in

these proceedings after the learned Magistrate has issued an order of eviction. Delay is a ground

to refuse the discretionary relief by way of writ of certiorari.

/ Hearing

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 1st Respondent should have

given the Petitioner a hearing before issuing the quit notice. He relied inter alia on the following

dicta of Denning J. in Schmidt v. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs [(1969) 1 All. E.R. 904):

"There is now no distinction between judicial and administrative decisions"

"The rules of natural justice applied whenever an individual has some right, interest or

legitimate expectation"

There is no dispute that the Petitioner was not given a hearing before the quit notice was issue.

However, section 2(lA) of the Act states:

"(lA) No person shall be entitled to any hearing or to make any representation in

respect of a notice under subsection (1)."

This sub-section was brought in by the amending Act No. 29 of 1983, the Bill of which was referred

to the Supreme Court under Article 122(1)(b) of the Constitution as it stood then. The Supreme

Court in S.D. No.2 of 1983 held that the proposed sub-section appears to be inconsistent with

Article 4(c) of the Constitution in that it seeks to oust the exercise by the Court of th e judicial

power of the People and therefore the Bill requires in terms of Article 123(2)(b) to be passed by

the special majority specified under the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84.

At that pOint the learned Deputy Solicitor General indicated that the intention of the amendment

is to limit the hearing or representation referred to in section 3(lA) before the competent

authority. It is now an accepted principle that the application of the rules of natural justice can

be excluded from administrative decision making process {Saeed v. Minister for Immigration and

Citizenship [(2010) HCA 23; 241 CLR 252; 84 AUR 507; 267 ALR 204; 115 ALD 493]}.

This now is the law and therefore the Petitioner cannot claim to have a right to be heard by the

competent authority before a quit notice is issued.

For all the above reasons, the application is dismissed with costs.
