The Aggrieved Petitioner-Appellant -

The Aggrieved Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North

Western Province holden in Kurunegala dated 05.11.2014 in Case No. HCR

143/2012 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned

Magistrate ofKuliyapitiya dated 20.09.2012 in Case No. 74729.

Facts of the Case:

The Accused-3'd respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused')

was charged in the Magistrate's Court of Kuliyapitiya for transporting timber on or

about 22.02.2012, utilizing a Lorry bearing No. 41 Shri 4134, and thereby

committed an offence punish;ible under section 25(2) of the Forest Ordinance. The

accused pleaded guilty to the charge and the Learned Magistrate convicted him

accordingly. The accused was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.50, 000/= with a default

sentence of 2 months imprisonment.

Thereafter, a vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the Lorry and at the inquiry,

the aggrieved petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "appellant") and

another witness gave evidence.

Page 3 of 11

At conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by . order dated 20.09.2012.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision application in the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Kurunegala. The

Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate and

dismissed the revision application.

Thereafter, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted following grounds of appeal,

in written submissions;

1. The charge is defective

2. The Learned Magistrate has failed to frame a charge

3. The appellant had taken precautions to prevent the commission of an offence

4. The Learned Magistrate failed to consider that the offence was committed

without the appellant's knowledge

5. The appellant had no knowledge of the offence

6. Additional matters that ought to be considered before confiscating a vehicle.

I wish to consider the 1 Sl and 2nd ground of appeal in which challenged the validity

of the charge. The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the charge

does not specify the type of timber alleged to have been transported. It was argued

that since not all types of timber need a permit for transportation, the mere

transportation of 'timber' without a permit is not an offence. In support of his

contention, the Learned Counsel submitted the case of Abubackerge Jaleel V.

OIC, Anti-Vice unit, Police Station, Anuradapura rCA (PHC) 108/2010].

Page 4 of 11

In reply to the above contention, the Le~med sse for the 2nd respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') submitted that

defectiveness of the charge was not taken up as a ground of appeal in the petition,

but it was raised for the first time in written submissions. The Leamed sse further

argued that legality of the charge has to be questioned or raised before the accused

had pleaded guilty. Therefore, it cannot be taken up as a ground of appeal at this

stage.

In the case of K. W. P. G. Samaratunga V. ~ange Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura [C.A (PHC) No. 89/2013 - decided on 16.10.2014], it was held

that,

"At this stage, it is important to note that it is for the first time that such a

defence is being advanced on behalf of the appellant. It has not been taken

up in the courts below though it is a question involving facts of the case.

When matters arising out of the facts of the case are to be raised at the

appeal stage, those should have been the matters taken up before the trial

judge. As stated before, nothing had been mentioned before the trial judge in

this instance, as to the failure to mention the details of the vehicle in the "B"

report or in the charge sheet. Hence, the appellant is not in a position to

take up the said issue as to the failure to refer the details of the vehicle

involved in the "B" report or in the charge sheet, at this appeal stage. This

position is supported by the following authorities.

In the case of JAYAWICKREMA Vs. DAVID SILVA [76 NLR 427J it was

held that a pure question of law can be raised in appeal for the first time,

but if it is a mixed question of fact and law it cannot be done .... "

Page 5 of 11

It is settled law that an appellant is not allm'led to raise fresh grounds, which are

mixed questions of fact and law, at the appeal stage against a revision application

filed in the High Court. I observe that the appellant had not raised any objection to

the charge at the Magistrate's Court or the High Court.

In the case of H.P.D. Nimal Ranasinghe V. OIC, Police, Hettipola [SC Appeal

149/2017], it was held that,

"The question that must be decided is whether any prejudice was caused to

the accused-appellant as a result of the said defeCt in the charge sheet or

whether he was misled by the said defect. It has to be noted here that the

accused-appellant, at the trial, had not taken up an objection to the charge

sheet on the basis of the said defect. In this connection judicial decision in

the case of Wickramasinghe Vs Chandradasa 67 NLR 550 is important.

In the case of A.K.K. Rasika Amarasinghe V. Attorney General and another

[SC Appeal 140/2010], it was held that,

"The Accused-Appellant has not raised an objection to the charge at the

trial. In the first place we note that at page 97, the Accused-Appellant has

admitted that he knows about the charge. As I pointed out earlier the

Accused-Appellant has failed to raise any objections to the charge at the

trial. In this regard I rely on the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal

in 45 NLR page 82 in King V. Kitchilan wherein the Court of Criminal

appeal held as follows:

"The proper time at which an objection of the nature should be taken

is before the accused has pleaded"

Page 6 of 11

it is well settled law that if a charge, sheet is defective, objection to the

charge sheet must be raised at the very inception."

In the case of R. G. Sujith Priyantha V. OIC, Police station, Poddala and

others ICA (PRC) 157/2012], it was held that,

"In this instance, the claim of the appel/ant who is not an accused in the

case had been made after the two accused were found guilty on their own

plea. Therefore, it is understood that the Court was not in a position to

consider the validity of the charge sheet at tha't belated point of time.

Indeed, an application under the aforesaid proviso to Section 40 in the

Forest Ordinance could only be made when confiscation has taken place

under the main Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. Aforesaid main

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance imposes a duty upon the Magistrate who

convicted the accused under the Forest Ordinance to confiscate the vehicle

used in committing such an offence ... " (Emphasis added)

In light of above judgments, it is obvious that a party is not allowed to raise an

objection with regard to a defect in the charge sheet at a belated point of time.

Further, in the instant case, the appellant had not raised this issue at the stage of

revision application in the High Court. That reason too will stop the appellant from

relying on these two grounds of appeal, at the later stage in this Court. Therefore,

the said two grounds of appeal should necessarily fail.

Now r wish to consider the 3rd ground of appeal in which it was argued that the

appellant had taken precautions to prevent the commission of an offence and she

had been vigilant about whereabouts and the activities committed using her

vehicle.

Page 7 of 11

The appellant testified that she bought the L.orry to transport goods for her shop

and occasionally, the Lorry was given on hire to transport bricks. On the date of

the incident, the appellant had given the vehicle for a hire to transport bricks. The

appellant had inquired about the hire from the bricks owner and he had informed

her that 4000 bricks had been transported and further 6000 bricks were to be

transported. Thereafter, the appellant had fallen asleep around lOpm and later she

was informed that the Lorry was taken into Police custody.

I observe that both the Learned Magistrate and the Leam~d High Court Judge were

of the view that merely inquiring about the vehicle from the brick owner was not

sufficient and the appellant had not proved to the satisfaction of Court that she in

fact took all precautions to prevent an offence being committed. I observe that the

Learned Magistrate had come to a correct conclusion after considering the

evidence available and I do not see any erroneous conclusion of the Learned

Magistrate or the Leamed High Court Judge, as alleged by the Learned Counsel for

the appellant. Therefore, I see no merits in the 3'd ground of appeal.

In 4th and 5th ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the appellant had no knowledge of the offence.

Now it is trite law that, a vehicle owner whose vehicle was involved in an offence

under the Forest Ordinance is required to prove preventive measures taken by him,

in order to avoid his vehicle being confiscated, as per section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance (amendment Act No. 65 of 2009). Even though the previous law

allowed a vehicle owner to prove either he took precautions or he had no

knowledge of an offence being committed, the amended section 40 only focuses on

the precautions taken by a vehicle owner in question.

Page 8 of 11

In the case of W. Jalathge Surasena V. O.~.C, Hikkaduwa and 3 others rCA

(PHC) APN 100/2014], it was held that,

" ... A mere denial by the of Registered Owner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge, of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle

laid down in the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of a vehicle

which had been used for a commission of an offence for an unauthorized

purpose ... "

Therefore, I am of the view that mere denial of the knowledge about an offence

being committed is not sufficient for a vehicle owner to discharge the burden cast

on him, under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended). I do not think that

a vehicle owner, under the present law, can submit the absence of knowledge as a

ground to avoid a vehicle confiscation, anymore. Therefore, the above two grounds

of appeal too should fail.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that there are additional matters

that ought to be considered before confiscating a vehicle. The Learned Counsel

submitted the case of A.M. Sadi Banda V. Officer-in Charge, Police Station,

Norton Bridge rCA (PHC) 03/2013 - decided on 25.07.2014], in support of his

contention.

However, I observe that in the case of Ceylinco Leasing Corporation Limited V.

M.H. Harison and others [SC Appeal No. 43/2012 - decided on 08.12.2016], it

was observed that,

"Forest Ordinance No.16 of J 907, is described in its long title as "an

Ordinance to consolidate and amend the law relating to forests and felling

and transport of timber". Some of the provisions of the Act reflects the

Page 9 of 11

choice of policy, in the instant case it is, undoubtedly designed with a view to

protect the environment. "

It is manifestly clear that the Legislature was trying to enact strict provisions with

regard to the offences concerning the environment. As I have already mentioned,

the sole requirement of section 40 is 'proving precautions taken by the vehicle

owner to prevent an offence being committed'. There is no statutory requirement

about considering the value of timber or any other additional matter like whether

there are previous convictions against the same vehicl.e, before confiscating a

vehicle under the Forest Ordinance. Therefore, it is understood that the purpose of

section 40 is to confiscate a vehicle involved in an offence under the Forest

Ordinance regardless of the value of the timber or any other additional matter.

Accordingly, there is no merit in the final ground of appeal as well.

Considering above, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 20.09.2012 and the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

05.11.2014. Therefore, I affirm the same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
