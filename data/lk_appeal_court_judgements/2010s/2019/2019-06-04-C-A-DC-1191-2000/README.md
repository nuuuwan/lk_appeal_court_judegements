Decided on 21.09.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

he Plaintiff~ Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action to partition a land called Kahatagahawatte alias Porawakaragewatte

described as lot A in the preliminary plan bearing No.2976. The surveyed extent of lot A is

described as 3 roods and 34.3 perches. There was no contest about the identity of the

corpus and in fact it was recorded as an admission at the trial. The 1st to 4th Defendant~

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the 1st to 4th Defendants") filed a

statement of claim essentially agreeing with the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants

stood in the relationship of nephews and nieces to the Plaintiff.

The 5th to 9th Defendant~ Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the 5th to 9th

Defendants") filed their statement of claim and disclosed a pedigree which brought out

different original owners, who were indeed accepted by the learned Additional District

Judge of Galle to be the original owners in the case. As such I would begin from these three

original owners whose land finally ended up as the subject~matter of this case. Even the 1st

to 4th Defendants who initially filed a statement of claim supporting the pedigree of the

Plaintiff made a volt~face and filed an amended statement of claim accepting the original

owners put forward by the 5th to 9th Defendants ~ see para 3 of the amended statement of

claim filed by the 1st to 4th Defendants dated 1O.09.l993 at p.S8 of the Appeal Brief.

Thus the original owners of the land were l)Ismail Lebbe Marikkar 2)Idroos Lebbe

Marikkar and 3) Mohamadu Ummah. Since the 1st to 4th Defendants have conceded this and

the learned Additional District Judge of Galle has accepted the devolution flowing from

these three original owners, I would reproduce the pedigree filed by the 5th to 9th

Defendants, which depicted the devolution.

The three original owners owned the entire land and by a Deed bearing No.4793 and dated

18.06.1901, they sold the entirety of the corpus to two brothers, Majuwana Gamage

Nukulas Silva and Majuwana Gamage Jeremias Appuhamy. Nikulas and Jeremias acquired

an undivided half share each of the corpus. This disposition was marked as 5D2 (page 98

and 334 of the Appeal Brief). One half of the land was acquired by Nikulas Silva, whilst the

other half went to his brother Jeremias Appuhamy. As the pedigree at page 54 of the

5

Appeal Brief, which I have reproduce above, shows, Nilmlas Silva sold his share to

Wakwella Gamage Cicilihamy by a Deed bearing No.498. Cicilihamy, by two consecutive

deeds executed on the same day, namely 30.03.1925, transferred a portion of her share to

Don Diyes,the predecessor in title of the Plaintiff. By a Deed bearing No.322 dated

30.03.1925, Cicilihamy sold an undivided 1/4th share to Don Diyes, whilst she gifted an

undivided 7/32 share to Don Diyes. By these two dispositions Don Diyes obtained an

undivided 15/32 share of Nikulas Silva's half share. Long before these dispositions of 1925,

as far back as 03.09.1918, Cicilihamy had already gifted 1/32 share to Niyagamage Jamis

Appu who was the father and predecessor in title of the 5th to 9th Defendants. This is how

Cicilihamy transferred the half share of the corpus, which had belonged to Nikulas Silva.

I must point out that the Plaintiff and 1st to 4th Defendants all claim under Don Diyes who

had got 15/32 shares under the two Deeds bearing No.322 and 323. Since the balance 1/32

share had already been gifted to J amis Appuhamy, who is the predecessor in tide of the 5th

to 9th Defendants, the sum total of the paper title to half share of Nikulas Silva would be as

follows:,

The paper title to Nikulas Silva's 15/32 share is with the Plaintiff and r t to 4th Defendants, whilst

the paper title to 1/32 share is vested in the 5th to 9th Defendants through their father J amis

Appuhamy.

I must at this stage interpose and make the observation that there is no contest among the

parties as far as the devolution of the half share of Nikulas Silva to the land is concerned.

This single contest that figured prominently in the District Court was about the other half

share which had belonged to Jeremias Appuhamy. Neither of the contesting parties could

produce any paper title to this half share. Instead what the Plaintiff asserted was that

when Jeremias Appuhamy passed away, Nanayakkarawasam Wakwella Gamage Don

Diyes (the Plaintiff's predecessor in title) prescribed to the balance half share of the land.

In other words the Plaintiff staked a claim to the balance half share of the land on

prescription. The 5th to 9th Defendants put forward a different claim to this half share.

Their argument went as follows. Jeremias Appuhamy had died unmarried and issueless.

6

Their mother Eththiligoda Gamage Sopihamine was the only living relative (niece) of

Jeremias Appuhamy to whom, the 5th to 9th Defendants argued, their mother succeeded

under the law of intestate succession. So in a nutshell whilst the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th

Defendants claimed title to one half share of Jeremias Appuhamy on prescription, the 5th to

9th Defendants made their claim to the half share based on intestate succession. I must say

that the 5th to 9th Defendants did not place credible evidence to establish that their mother

Sopihamine had succeeded as an intestate heir to the balance half share of Jeremias

Appuhamy and this Court would proceed on the basis that the 5th to 9th Defendants had

no intestate rights in the balance half share of the corpus. The only question before this

Court is then whether the Plaintiff has prescriptive rights to the half share of Jeremias

Appuhamy.

These were the main issues that the parties principally proceeded to trial in the District

Court of Galle and only three witnesses gave evidence at the trial. Whilst the Plaintiff gave

evidence at the trial in order to buttress his case, the 4th Defendant testified on behalf of

the 1st to 4th Defendants. The 8th Defendant gave evidence on behalf of the 1st to 9th

Defendants.

I would digress at this stage to look at the locational habitation of the parties on the land.

The report of the surveyor at p 217 sets out the respective claims of parties. One finds a

number of houses and buildings standing spread out discretely on the land and according

to the surveyor, the buildings marked from 1 to 5 were claimed by the 5th to 8th Defendants,

whilst the buildings and structures marked as 6, 7, 8,9,10, 11 and 12 were claimed by the

Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants.

One significant aspect of the situational location of the parties is that there were no

boundaries confining the parties to defined locations. There emerges evidence of collective

enjoyment of the entire land, though there are houses standing at discrete distances. The

only boundaries, if at all, are the external boundaries to the land.

The question of specific locations where co-owners reside on a co-owned land is quite

relevant when considering whether or not a presumption of ouster should be drawn in the

7

event long and continued possession is alleged and the fact that no party has enjoyed the

land to the exclusion of others is a recognition of the others' interest in the land.

Bearing in mind the pivotal question on which this case was litigated in the District Court

of Galle, namely whether the Plaintiff established his case of prescription within Section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance, it is apposite to allude to the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle dated 29.09.1999 (at p.201~211 of the Appeal Brief). The

learned Additional District Judge deals with the devolution of Nilmlas Silva's share from

pages 1 to 7 and at page 7 of his judgment he has allotted shares which add to 80/60. This is

the correct devolution as far as one half of the corpus is concerned. This deals with

Nikulas Silva's share and this computation is unassailable.

Afterwards the learned Additional District Judge proceeds to deal with the prescriptive

title claimed by the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants. He holds in favour of the Plaintiff

and the 1st to 4th Defendants that they have prescribed to the other one half of the corpus

namely the half share that had belonged to Jeremias Appuhamy. As I said before, this was

the focal issue in the arguments before this Court. Mr. Amrit Rajapakse~the learned

Counsel for the 5th to 9th Defendant~Appellants strenuously contended that this was an

erroneous decision on the part of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle.

In order to prove prescriptive title, the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants relied on 4

deeds, namely, P21, P22, P23 and P24. These are a series of transactions which the

Plaintiff's privies indulged in dealing with a greater portion of the corpus than they were

really entitled to on paper. From the foregoing it is clear that the Plaintiff is entitled to

15/32 shares of the half share of Nikulas Silva. This is the paper title that the Plaintiff and

the 1st to 4th Defendants had. But the prescriptive title they claim is over and above that

paper entitlement and that prescriptive title encompasses some portions of the half share

of Jeremias Appuhamy. The transactions that the privies of the Plaintiff had entered into

would be tabulated as follows: ~

06.05.1949 N anayakkarawasan Wakwella Gamage

(P24)

Francis (Mortgagors)

The deeds P21, P22, P23 and P24 were relied upon by the Plaintiff in order to prove

prescription to the undivided half share of Jeremias Appuhamy.

In P21, Cicilihamy who had a life ~interest and Don Diyes (the Plaintiff's privies) had leased

out the fruits (the plantation) of the entire land to Franciscu Appuhamy. There is no

evidence in the case though that the lessee Franciscu Appuhamy came on the land and

enjoyed the fruits.

In P22, Don Diyes had leased out 27/32 shares of the soil and trees excluding the house on

the land to one Balappu.

In P23 of 1938, which is a mortgage bond, Don Diyes (the Plaintiff's privy) and his wife

Hinnihamy dealt with 27/32 shares and after the death of Don Diyes, his widow

Hinnihamy and a son Francis had leased out in 1949 27/32 shares on P24.

The learned Additional District Judge concluded that these notarially attested instruments

"P21 to P24" provide evidence of ouster leading to prescription. Needless to say, a

transaction in 27/32 shares of the corpus is certainly over and above the paper title of the

Plaintiff's predecessor which was only 1/32nd share in the other half. So when Don Diyes

9

..

dealt with 27/32 shares, he did encroach upon the portion of the remaining half share of

Jeremias Appuhamy.

By transacting in 27/32nd shares of the land, Don Diyes and his widow let out on lease and

mortgage more than what they were entitled to on paper title but yet about I/Sth of the half

share of Jeremias still remained intact, even if it could be argued that the V32nd share of the

5th to 9th Respondents were not touched at all. In other words the entirety of one half of

Jeremias' share was not dealt with by the Plaintiff's privies except P21 where they

purported to lease out the fruits of the entire land. But there is no evidence that these

transactions brought on the land outsiders who read the riot act to the 5th to 9th

Defendants who had been on the land for a long time. Notwithstanding these features in

these transactions, the learned Additional District Judge of Galle proceeded to hold that

the Plaintiff and the 1st to 4 th Defendants had prescribed to one half of Jeremias

Appuhamy's share.

Mr. Amrit Rajapakse impugned the findings of the learned Additional District Judge on

prescription on 2 prinCipal grounds: /

1. The transactions to lease out and mortgage 27/32nd shares were all done in secrecy

and behind the back of the 5th to 9th Defendants who were still c%wners having an

undivided 1/32nd share.

2. Prescription must relate to a defined portion on the ground and it cannot be in

shares as the Plaintiff and his predecessors have done in this case / All the

transactions no doubt deal in fractional shares of 27/32and they are not rooted to a

particular defined and specific portions of the corpus.

These two questions raise questions of law and it is on these questions that the resolution

of this appeal is rooted.

In regard to the rst question, it is axiomatic that the 5th to 9th Defendants became the co/

owners in 1915, when their father Jeremias Appuhamy acquired 1/32nd share of the land

from Cicilihamy. Their mother Sopihamine was a niece of Cicilihamy and on the marriage

of her niece to J amis Appu (the father of the 5th to 9th Defendants), Cicilihamy gifted 1/32nd

10

..

share to Jamis Appu in 1918. Thus since 1918 their privy Jamis Appuhamy and the 5th to 9th

Defendants had been in possession of the land. Even the 4th Defendant who gave evidence

on behalf of the 1

st to 4th Defendants concedes this position. Even when one peruses the

preliminary plan and the report, it is clear that the houses of the 5th to 9th Defendants are

scattered across the land and it would appear that these buildings occupy a larger portion

in the middle of the land. W hile this state of affairs remained on the ground, the Plaintiff's

privies who also had undivided shares in the land (16/32) were seeking to deal with more

than their share totaling up to 27/32 shares. A fractional share of 27/32 would definitely

touch not only a portion of the remaining V2 of Jeremias Appuhamy but also 1/32nd share of

the 5th 9th Defendants.

The fact that the 5th to 9th Defendants came to know about the existence of these deeds

only during the course of the trial is quite apparent. Can the Plaintiffs in these

circumstances rely on P21, P22, P23 and P24 to argue that they have prescribed to the 112

share of Jeremias Appuhamy?

Can one argue that by executing the deeds P21, P22, P23 and P24, the Plaintiff's privies

ousted the other co~owners and even the heirs of Jeremias Appuhamy if there was any of

them? The tenor of authorities on this question of law goes against the conclusion of the

learned Additional District Judge of Galle. Mr. Amrit Rajapakse adverted to Prof. G.L

Peiris's Law of Property in Sri Lanka Volume ~ 1 at page 363 that deals with this question of

law.

The following cases set out the law on the question whether one co~owner can oust

another co~owner and claim prescription by alienation of the entirety or part of the co ~

owned land.

In Corea v. /seris Appuhamy(l911) 15 N.LR 65, the defendant who attempted to set up a

prescriptive title against his co~owners, had de facto possession of the whole estate for over

thirty years. The trial Judge found that, during this period, he had planted, leased,

mortgaged and sold various lands and generally dealt with them as owner. In spite of this

11

..

and other findings of fact in favour of the defendant, the Privy Council refused to uphold

his claim to tile by prescriptive possession.

In the case of Careem v. Ahamadu (1923) 5 Ceylon Law Recorder 170, Thomas Forrest

Garvin, A.J with Porter, J. agreeing held that the mere fact that one co~owner was in

occupation of the entirety of a house which was owned in common and purported to

execute deeds in respect of the entirety for a period of over ten years does not lead to the

presumption of an ouster in the absence of evidence to show that the other co~owners had

knowledge of the transactions. The same principle was affirmed in Sideris v. Simon 46

N.L.R 273 where there was also no evidence that the contesting co~owners knew of the

execution of the various deeds by one co~owner , Howard C.J. (with Canekeratne, J.

agreeing) observed: "This deed ignores the rights of the daughters of H. But do these deeds

inevitably point to an acquiescence by the daughters of H in the acquisition of their rights

as co~owners by the sons? Was the making of these deeds something equivalent to an

ouster?" Based on the decision in Tillekeratne v. Bastian 21 N.L.R 12, the learned Chief

Justice said, "without such proof there was nothing more than a secret intention in the

minds of the transferors and lessors to initiate a prescriptive title and put an end to the co~

owners' co ~possession. This is not sufficient to constitute ouster".

A co~owner who is in possession of the entirety of a property and whose execution of

deeds in respect of it is without the knowledge of other co~owners cannot give rise to an

inference of ouster. The criterion of awareness by the other co ~owners was emphasized in

Ummu Ham v. Koch (1946) 47 N.L.R 107 where M.W.H. De Silva, J. (with Howard C.J

agreeing) held that: "mere possession and the execution, without the knowledge of the

other co~owners, of deeds referring to the whole of the common property by a co~owner

are not sufficient to constitute an ouster".

A co~owner cannot by a secret intention formed in his own mind change the character of

his possession of the common land to the detriment of his co~owners. The mere fact that a

co ~owner who was in occupation of the common property purported to execute deeds in

respect of the entirety of it for a long period of years without the knowledge of the other

co~owners does not lead to the presumption of an ouster in the absence of evidence to

12

...

show that the other co-owners had knowledge of the transactions-Kobbekaduwa v.

Seneviratne 53 N.L.R 354.

In the case of Githohamy v. Karanagoda 56 N.L.R 250, a co-owner made a plan of a

definite portion of the common land and improved and possessed it for a period of 40 years

to the exclusion of other co-owners who possessed other portions of the same land. The

Supreme Court took the view that, in the absence of evidence to establish that the other

co-owners acquiesced in the preparation of the plan, the production of the plan by itself

was insufficient either to establish an amicable partition among the co-owners or to justify

a presumption of ouster.

The rationale underlying this statement of the law was spelt out as follows by Basnayake

C.J (with Pulle,j. concurring) in Gunawardena v. Samarakoon (1958) 60 N.L.R 481, "The

possession of one co-owner is the possession of the other co-owners, and that possession

qua co-owner cannot be ended by any secret intention in the mind of the possessing co-

owner. The latter proposition is in accordance with the maxim, nano sibi causam possessionis

mutare potest. The possession of one co-owner does not become possession by a title adverse

to or independent of that of the others till ouster or something equivalent to ouster takes

place.

These catena of authorities establish 2 propositions in regard to alienations made by one

co-owner in respect of the entirety or part of the co-owned property. In order to prove

ouster of a co-owner, the Plaintiff must prove 2 things;

1. the Defendant co-owner knew about the transfers;

2. he acquiesced in the transfers.

There is no evidence of all this in this case. The learned Additional District Judge of Galle

was oblivious to all these principles and committed a cardinal error when he relied upon

the aforesaid deeds to infer ouster. In the circumstances, I conclude that the Plaintiff and

the 1st to 4th Defendants have not proved ouster and there is no prescriptive title they have

established in regard to the undivided half share of Jeremias Appuhamy. There was also

another fundamental argument that Mr. Amrit Rajapakse urged-namely, in order for a co-

B

owner to successfully set up prescriptive title against his other co~owners, it is necessary

for him to physically possess a defined portion of the co~owned land to the exclusion of

the other co~owners . The learned Counsel contended that adverse possession on the part

of a co~owner must be based on physical possession of a defined and demarcated portion

of the corpus.

One cannot but detect the great force in this argument. It is axiomatic that Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance embodies both a physical element and a mental element. The

physical element must be referable to possession in respect of a defined portion of land.

The mental element consists of the intention of possessing as owner which is fehcitously

called ut dominus possession. Roman law classified ut dominus possession as possession qua

an owner. In fact in the full bench decision of the Supreme Court in Tillekeratne v.

Bastians (1918) 21 N.LR 12 at p 20, Bertram C.]., declared:

"If it is found that one co~owner and his predecessors in interest have been in possession of the whole

property for a period as far back as memory reaches, that they have nothing to recognize the claims

of the other co~owners ..... "

The above passage clearly postulates that the adverse possession must be pivoted and

rooted to a defined portion of land. A series of secret dispositions of 27/32 fractional shares

by way of leases and mortgages without specifying defined and demarcated portions of the

land does not manifest any physical possession nor does it indicate ut dominus possession. I

have already alluded to the situational habitation of the parties. The prehminary plan only

shows that both the Plaintiff and the 5th to 9th Defendant~Appellants have been jointly

enjoying the corpus, without any physical boundaries. Therefore the basic requirements

for estabhshing prescriptive possession are woefully absent in the case before me.

In the circumstances I proceed to hold that the Plaintiff has not estabhshed any

prescriptive right to the half share of Jeremias Appuhamy. It goes without saying that even

the 5th to 9th Defendant~ Appellants have not estabhshed any rights to the half share of

Jeremias Appuhamy. Since neither party has estabhshed prescription, the one half share of

Jeremias Appuhamy has to remain unallotted. The devolution through Nikulas Silva and

14

..

..

Cicilihamy to the Plaintiffs, 1st to 4th Defendants and 5th to 9th Defendants, as found by the

District Court at page 7 of the judgment dated 29.09.1999, is unobjectionable and it is only

the finding in relation to devolution of the half share of Jeremias Appuhamy that is

erroneous.

In the circumstances I set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle dated 29.09.1999 and allow the appeal of the 5th to 9th Defendant-Appellants. While

giving effect to this judgment, the learned District Judge of Galle is directed to bear in mind

that whilst the devolution in relation to one half share of Nikulas Silva would be in

accordance with what the original Court judgment dated 29.09.1999 has stated as at page

7 of that judgment, the other half share of Jeremias Appuhamy has to remain un allotted.

The learned District Judge of Galle is directed to enter judgment and decree accordingly.
