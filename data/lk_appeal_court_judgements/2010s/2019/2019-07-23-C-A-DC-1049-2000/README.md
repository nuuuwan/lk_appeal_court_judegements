JUDGMENT ON 23.07.2019

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. 01 S\ 02nd and 3rd Plaintiff Respondents (Plaintiffs) filed the above partition

action in the District Court of A vissawella to partition the land called

Hikgahawatta alias Hikowite Watta in extent of approximately 01 acre and

01 rood. Preliminary plan No.4286 was prepared by licensed surveyor Sena

Iddamalgoda which was marked and produced as X at the trial. In the

preliminary plan, the land was shown in 02 lots as lot Oland 02.

02. The 2nd Defendant Appellant (Appellant) by her statement of claim, while

disputing the Plaintiff's pedigree, claimed prescriptive title to lot No 02 in

the preliminary plan. After trial, the learned District Judge in his judgment

held that the 2nd Defendant Appellant failed to prove prescriptive title to lot

No.02 and accepting the plaintiff's pedigree ordered that the shares to be

divided according to the Plaintiff's pedigree.

03. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, Appellant preferred the instant

appeal. The contention of the Appellant is that the learned District Judge

erred when he decided that the Appellant failed to prove his prescriptive title

to lot No. 02 of the preliminary plan X. It is submitted by the counsel for the

Appellant that on the evidence placed before the District Court, Appellant

has proved that the Appellant and her predecessors possessed lot No.02

exclusively against the other co-owners.

3

04. The contention of the Plaintiffs is that, as admitted by the Appellant in cross

examination, that Corenelis had 5 children and not only Marthelis as alleged

by the Appellant. Therefore, the alleged contention that Marthelis is the only

heir of Corenelis is not tenable. It is further submitted, that the Appellant

admitted that 1 st Defendant possessed lot No. 01, and therefore, there was no

agreement or an arrangement entered upon by the co-owners to divide the

lots and possess the land separately.

05. Although, Plaintiffs now contend that Cornelis had 5 children including

Marthelis, neither the Plaintiffs nor the Appellant and the other Respondents

in the action in the District Court had taken steps to include them as parties

to the action. Nor they have intervened as parties to the action.

06. When the parties are co-owners, mere possession for 10 years would not

suffice to gain prescriptive title to a land co-owned. Every co-owner is

presumed to be in possession in his capacity as a co-owner. In case of Maria

Fernando V. Anthony Fernando [1997J 2 Sri L.R. page 356 Court of

Appeal held that:

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of

produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a party,

preparing plan and building house on land and renting it are not

enough to establish prescription among co-owners in the absence of

an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe may not amount

to an ouster"

07. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Court to see not only whether the 2nd

Defendant possessed lot No.02 of the preliminary plan 'X' for more than 10

4

years, but also whether before commencIng the period of 10 years of

possession, there had been an overt act of ouster against the other co-owners.

08. According to the Surveyor Sena Iddamalgoda, and according to the report

submitted on the preliminary plan, 1 st and the 2nd Plaintiffs as well as 1 st ,2nd

and 4th respondents had been present when he went to survey the land. 4th

Respondent had claimed for the 10-12-year-old 'Albesia' plantation that was

in lot No.02. 2nd Defendant had said that she had been in possession of lot 02

for last 75 years. In evidence, 4th Defendant conceded that he planted

'Albesia' in lot No 02 with the permission of Appellant. He said that Sepala

planted in the other portion and that the two lots were divided by a live

fence. Appellant giving evidence said that her predecessor, and then she,

was in possession over lot 02 against others rights.

09. 1 st Plaintiff D. Pieris Dharmapala in his evidence In cross examination

admitted that the 4th Defendant Nimalasena, (the 4th Respondent) planted

'Albisia' in the southern part of the land. In cross examination he further

admitted that the Appellant and her predecessors had been in possession of

lot 2 since year 1961. He further admitted that the Appellant and her

predecessors possessed lot No.02 against the rights of others. As per his

evidence in page 114 of the District Court record:

10. Witness Singappuli Arachchilage Don David Jayathilake who testified on

behalf of the Plaintiffs also admitted that the 2nd Defendant's predecessors

possessed lot No.02 (Referred to as the land towards the south and west to

the land possessed by Sepalis) against the rights of all others. As recorded in

page 146 of the record he said:

11. Therefore, as admitted by the Plaintiffs it is clear that the Appellant had

gained prescriptive title by possessing lot No.02 for a period more than 10

years ousting all other co-owners. Hence the learned District Judge has erred

when he found that the Appellant had not proved prescriptive title to lot

No.02. Therefore, we make order that lot No. 02 of the preliminary plan No.

4286 of Surveyor Sena Iddamalgoda should be excluded from the land to be

partitioned.

Appeal allowed with costs.
