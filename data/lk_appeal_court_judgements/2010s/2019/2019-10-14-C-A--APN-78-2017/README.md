ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

The Petitioner, with her petition addressed to this Court, invokes its

revisionary jurisdiction and seeks to nullify an order made by the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Hambantota in

case No. HCA 47/2000, on the basis that it had no jurisdiction to make an

order on a dispute in relation to State land that had been brought before

Court under Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution. The Petitioner founded

said contention on the reasoning contained in the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Superintendent, Stafford Estate and two others v

Solaimuthu Rasu (2013) 1 Sri L.R. 25.

It is stated that the Petitioner is the eldest female child in her family

whereas the Petitioner-Respondent is the eldest of the males. The State

land in respect of which the dispute arose was developed by the father of

the Petitioner, who had been issued with a permit under the provisions of

Mahaweli Authority Act read with Land Development Ordinance. With the

death of the Petitioner's father N.5.P. John, in 1990 a dispute arose between

her and the 4th Respondent. After an inquiry held by the 1st Respondent,

Divisional Manager of Mahaweli Authority, it was decided that the western

portion of the land was to be given to Petitioner whilst the eastern portion

was given to the 4th Respondent.

Said determination by the 1st Respondent was given effect to by the

parties who divided the land with fencing. They were advised to "obtain

their grants under the Land Development Ordinance for their respective portions

of the land. "

3

This determination by the 1st Respondent was disputed by the

Petitioner- Respondent who sought to challenge its validity in the

Provincial High Court in Application No. 47/2000, seeking inter alia a Writ

of Mandamus. This application was filed on the basis that the Petitioner-

Respondent is the eldest male child of the family of the deceased permit

holder. On 11.12.2000, the Provincial High Court granted relief to the

Petitioner- Respondent with the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus.

The Petitioner had then filed an application No. 5/2003, also seeking

Writ of Mandamus from the Provincial High Court over the same

allotment of State land. The Provincial High Court, by its order dated

26.01.2008, dismissed her application as already it had decided the dispute

over the same land. The appeal No. CA (PHC) 56/06 filed by the

Petitioner against the said order of dismissal was subsequently withdrawn

by her on 16.10.2015.

With the pronouncement of the judgement in Superintendent,

Stafford Estate and two others v Solaimuthu Rasu (supra), the Petitioner

now claims that the order of Court which granted the Writ of Mandamus

in favour of the Petitioner-Respondent, is a nullity since the Provincial

High Court had no Writ jurisdiction over State lands.

At the inquiry of the instant application of the Petitioner, the parties

indicated that the matter could be decided on their written submissions

already tendered.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that when the judgment of

Superintendent, Stafford Estate and two others v Solaimuthu Rasu was

delivered N the judiciary laid down 'procedural Law' and not 'Substantive

4

Law'. As it is procedural Law, the Law was to be applicable for all times for all

purposes and can be applied retrospectively". Hence the Petitioner further

contends that" ... the entire result of the above judgment is that 'the Provincial

High Courts' never had power to hear and determine cases with respect to

recovery/dispossession of State lands, encroachment or its alienation".

The attempt by the Petitioner to apply the determination of the

Supreme Court in Rasu's case on the order of the Provincial High Court in

HCA 47/2000 is, in effect, to have its applicability in retrospectivity in her

favour. The order of the Provincial High Court is dated 11.12.2002 and

Rasu judgment was pronounced on 17.07.2013. The Petitioner seeks to

avoid the apparent conflict of her application with the presumption

against the retrospective application of law by terming the Rasu judgment

as a judgment which had laid down the applicable "procedural law".

It is to be noted that the Petitioner did not substantiate her claim that

the Rasu judgement has laid down the "procedural law" applicable to

litigation involving State land. She simply made a reference to the

contents of the said judgment. She also failed to place reliance upon a

binding judicial precedent which had recognised that a determination of

the scope of jurisdiction of an inferior Court by the apex Court as an

instance of laying down procedural law which binds not only its parties

but all such other disputes which had reached finality, retrospectively.

Since there were no submissions made by the parties on this important

point of law to assist this Court, it deliberately desists in making any

ruling on that issue.

5

However, even if the Petitioner's contention that the determination

by the Supreme Court in Rasu had in fact laid down the applicable

procedural law, she is not entitled to any relief. The reasons for this

conclusion are as set out below.

The principle of presumption against retrospective legislation has

been described by the Supreme Court in the judgment of De Silva v

Weersinghe (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 334, by reproduction of the relevant portions

from several authoritative texts. The Supreme Court also reproduced the

following segment of the text from Craies' Statute Law, 7th Edn., p. 387,

where it is stated:

II A statute is to be deemed to be retrospective, which

takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under

existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or imposes

a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to

transactions or considerations already past. But a

statute 'is not properly called a retrospective statute

because a part of the requisi tes for its action is drawn

from a time antecedent to its passing'. II

Their Lordships have quoted Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes

(12 thEdn at p.222 ) in order to highlight the position that the presumption

has no application to procedural laws and Rules of Court as the following

portion reproduced from the text reflects:

6

"The presumption against retrospective construction has no

application to enactments which affect only the procedure

and practice of the courts."

In Sendiris v Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and

Another (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 212, is a case where the question of arrears of rent

was sought to be determined upon provisions of an amended legislation.

This Court had, in the body of the said judgment, quoted the judgment of

Gunatilake v Walker Sons & Co Ltd. 79 (2) N.L.R. 563, where it was stated:

"The presumption against retrospective operation has no

application to enactments which affect only the procedure

and practice of the Courts. There is no presumption that a

change in procedure is intended to be prospective and not

retrospective. Alterations in the form of procedure are always

retrospective unless there is some good reason why they

should not be, Gardner vs. Lucas Blackburn. No person has a

vested right in any course of procedure, and he is bound to

follow such modes of seeking redress as the law may enjoin

from time to time. When a new remedy is granted or a

defective remedy is rectified . . . it cannot be said that the

rights of anyone are injuriously affected by the reforms .. . ",

and decided the issue presented before it for determination as follows:

" Therefore, the mere fact that the provisions of the

Agricultural Lands Law were not favourable to a tenant

7

cultivator does not mean that he has a vested right in the

continuance of the former procedure. Indeed, the

Agricultural Lands Law and even the Paddy Lands Act No.

1 of 1958, which was previously in force, imposed as a

requirement on every tenant cultivator the obligation to pay

rent to the landlord as provided for by law. Hence, a tenant

cultivator who fails to pay the rent as provided for by law is

in the categon) of a person who has violated a duty cast upon

him by law and he could not be heard to say that he has a

vested right to continue with his tenancy. The provisions of

section 28 of the Agricultural Lands Law and section 18 of

the Agrarian Services Act are procedural in nature. They

provide the means for the recovery and enforcement of the

requirement imposed by law on a tenant cultivator to pay

rent to the landlord. The provisions of section 18 should thus

be applicable wherever a tenant cultivator is in arrears of

rent irrespective of the time when such arrears accrued."

Thus, it is clear that even if changes were made to procedural laws

or to Rules, where a "vested right" is affected, such instances have been

treated as an exception to the applicability of the amended statutory

provisions retrospectively. The judgment of Rajadurai v Emerson (1995) 2

Sri L.R. 30, reflect this position clearly. This Court, in determining the

applicability of the changes that were brought to the statutory provisions

contained in section 337(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, with the

amendment Act No. 53 of 1993, decided that:

8

"The question whether the ten-year bar introduced in respect

of all decrees by the amendment of 1980 which came into

force on 11.12.80, will apply retrospectively to decrees

entered prior to that day was considered by the Supreme

Court in the case of Haji Omar v. M. H. Bodidasa (S.c.

48/93 - S.c. Minutes 6.12.94). Upon an exhaustive analysis

of the relevant provisions and the applicable case law,

Dheeraratne, J. held that the amendment would not apply in

relation to decrees for immovable property entered prior to

11.12.1980 being the date on which the amendment came

into operation. It was held by Their Lordships that the

judgment creditor's right to enforce the decree in his favour

is a substantive right and is not a matter of procedure. On

that basis it was held that the amendment of1980 "cannot be

regarded as purely procedural legislation insofar as it

purports to affect (or rather to destroy) the vested right of the

judgment creditor".

In Mulgirigala Co-operative Stores Socien} Ltd v Charlis 52 N.L.R.

567, the then Supreme Court, considered the question"... whether the

amendment to section 45 effected by the Act of 1949 dealt with a mere matter of

procedure or practice."

Having considered the above quoted the said pivotal issue in the

light of the applicable principles, the Court declares that:

9

" The answer is clearly in the negative. The right of the

plaintiffs to prosecute the suit filed by them in the District

Court was a substantial vested right. The Act is silent in

regard to pending actions and, therefore, the principle that

should be applied is that it ought not to be given a

retrospective operation so as to interfere with a vested right

unless one could say that it was retrospective by necessary

intendment, of which there is no-indication whatever.

The principle laid down in the case cited above was applied to

a pending case by the Divisional Bench in Guneratne v.

Appuhami [(1906) 9N.L.R. 90}. This was an action

instituted in 1900 for declaration of title to land and the

defendant took the plea that it was not maintainable

inasmuch as the estate of one of the plaintiff's predecessors in

title had not been administered The plaintiff sought to rely on

the first proviso to section 547 of the Civil Procedure Code,

which came into operation in 1904 during the pendency of the

sui t. Lascelles, A. C. J., s ta ted:

" Nothing is to be found in section 2 of Ordinance No.

12 of 1904 which shows any intention on the part of

the Legislature that the enactment should be

retrospective in the sense of affecting pending suits. It

was however contended that the enactment was a

matter of procedure only and as such would extend to

the present action ... In my opinion the question is

10

concluded by the judgment of the privy Council in the

Colonial Sugar Refining Company v. Irving [(1905)

A. C. 369.]".

Later at page 95 the learned Acting Chief Justice stated:

"If the Ordinance is given a retrospective effect the

defendant will be deprived of this defence. It is clear to

me that this is not merely a matter of procedure, it

touches a right which was in existence when the

Ordinance was enacted" .

It can equally well be stated in the present case that if the

amending Act is given retrospective effect, the plaintiff would

be deprived of the substantive right of prosecuting his suit

before the tribunal which he-had selected as of right before the

Act was passed."

The Supreme Court was also mindful of the disproportionate

consequences the affected party would suffer, if the contention advanced

before their Lordships, similar to the one that had been advanced by the

Petitioner in the instant application before this Court, is adopted. The

Court states thus:

"If the contention on behalf of the appellants is accepted it

would mean that, whatever be the stage of the pending action

at the time the amending Act came into operation, the

11

jurisdiction came to an end and the parties-had to bear the

inconvenience and expense of litigating afresh before the

Registrar or an arbitrator appointed by him. A far reaching

consequence of this kind could not have been intended by the

Legislature and the amending Act cannot bear a

construction that would lead to this result."

Weeramantry J held a similar view in Ram Banda v River Valleys

Development Board 71 N.L.R. 25. This is a matter where the one of the

questions that arose for determination was "" . whether the Statute can

operate retrospectively in regard to this termination without violence to the

principle that vested rights should not be interfered with by later legislation" in

relation to termination of services of an employee. In such circumstances,

the Court should" ... approach the problem of retrospective operation on the basis

that the provision of law" under its consideration is a provision"". which had

a real impact on legal rights and duties".

The Court had therefore decided:

"In Akilandanayaki v. Sothinagaratnam (1952) 53

N.L.R. 385, the Court was considering an amendment of the

Matrimonial Bights and Inheritance Ordinance changing the

definition of the diathettam prevailing under Ordinance No.

9 of 1911. It was held that no retrospective effect could in the

absence of express words or necessary implication be given to

new laws which affect rights acquired under the former law"

12

The Court reproduced the statement of law by Gratiaen J. in said case

where his Lordship pronounced that:

"Section 6 (3) of the Interpretation Ordinance was there

described by as giving statutory recognition to the rule of

judicial interpretation adopted in all civilised countries that

the courts should not lightly assume an intent on the part of

Parliament to introduce legislation prejudicially affecting

vested rights which have already been acquired."

The real dispute among the Petitioner and her siblings is the

succession rights over the parcel of State land possessed by their father

upon a permit issued under Land Development Ordinance. Chapter VII of

the said Ordinance with the title "SUCCESSSSION" governs the statutory

regime relating " ... to any land alienated on a permit or a holding." It also

deals with the entitlement of " ... a person who is entitled under this Chapter to

succeed to the land or holding upon the death of the permit holder or owner

thereof'.

Clearly these words, as they appear in Section 48 of the Land

Development Ordinance, seem to reflect that it had conferred certain

"vested rights" over parties in respect of their succession rights, upon the

death of a permit holder. As such, even if the position advanced by the

Petitioner that Rasu judgment had laid down the applicable procedural

law to her application as well and is therefore applicable to the instant

application with retrospective effect, is accepted as a legally valid

proposition, she is not entitled to any relief since the "vested rights" of

13

other Respondents are adversely affected by such retrospective application

of the Rasu judgment.

The Petitioner is not a party in the Rasu judgment. She merely relies

on the interpretation of the Supreme Court of the relevant Constitutional

articles to reach its determination that" Provincial High Courts never had

power to hear and determine cases with respect to recovery/dispossession of State

lands, encroachment or its alienation."

The judicial precedents cited above are in relation to situations

which dealt with amendments to statutory provisions and the

applicability of such amendments retrospectively. The issue before this

Court is about the applicability of a judgment retrospectively

This discussion brings up an interesting question in the form that

whether the said determination of the Supreme Court has retrospective

effect on the Respondent Petitioner's application before the Provincial High

Court in HCA 47/2000. Clearly none of the parties in the instant

application were parties to Rasu judgment. Then what is the effect on such

a judgment on other litigants who already had their rights determined by

the law as stood at that time?

In National Westminster Bank pic (Respondents) v. Spectrum Plus

Limited and others and others (Appellants) [2005] UKHL 41, the House of

Lords have decided that its judgment of Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v

Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142 was wrong and should be

overruled. Then the appellant bank made an application to limit the

applicability of the new judgment only "prospectively" due to the

hardships that the change of law would result in since the appellant and

14

its clients have transacted over the years acting on the legal principles that

are now overruled by the House of Lords. Their Lordships have

considered the reasons for and against the question of prospective

application of this ruling.

Having discussed the relevant considerations at length, Lord

Nicholls, observed that:

"A Court ruling which changes the law from what it was

previously thought to be operates retrospectively as well as

prospectively. The ruling will have a retrospective effect so

(ar as the parties to the particular dispute are concerned, as

occurred with the manufacturer of the ginger beer in

Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562. "(emphasis

added)

In view of this approach, that a judgment of Court, when it lays

down its view differently at a subsequent stage, will have retrospective

effect of the change it had brought about only among parties to that

litigation. Hence, the Petitioner's contention does not seem to be a

plausible one, when considered with the limitation of applicability of the

retrospective application imposed by the House of Lords.

It should also be noted that Section 48 qualifies its application to " ...

to any land alienated on a permit or a holding." Thus, if the dispute arose as to

the proper succession, then that land had already been" ... alienated on a

permit". Rasu confines the limitation of the of the writ jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court only in respect of "... powers relating to

15

Recovery/dispossession of State Lands, encroachment or alienation of State

Lands."

None of these powers were exercised by the Provincial High Court

when it granted a Writ of Mandamus on the Petitioner-Respondent with its

order in case No. HCA 47/2000.

Hence, it is the considered view of this Court that the Petitioner is

not entitled to any relief she had prayed for in the instant application. Her

application for revision is therefore refused.

The petition of the Petitioner is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000.00.
