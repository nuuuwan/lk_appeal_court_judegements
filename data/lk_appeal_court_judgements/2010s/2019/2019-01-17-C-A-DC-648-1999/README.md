Samayawardhena, J.

The three plaintiffs filed this action against the three defendants

seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to the

plaint between the 3rd plaintiff (subject to the life interest of the

1st and 2nd plaintiffs) and the 1st defendant in equal shares. The

2nd and 3rd defendants, according to the plaint, were made

parties because they are in forcible occupation of the land

without any soil rights. The 1st defendant did not contest the

case of the plaintiff.

The only contesting defendants were the 2nd and 3rd defendants

who are the wife and husband respectively. The 2nd defendant is

not an alien. She is the daughter of the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs,

and the sister of the 3rd plaintiff.

The 2nd and 3rd defendants took up two positions at the trial.

One is, they have prescribed to the landvide issue Nos. 9 and

10. The other is, the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action on

res judicata in view of the decree entered in case No.17478vide

issue Nos. 11 and 12.

3

The learned District Judge held against the 2nd and 3rd

defendants on both points and decided to partition the land as

prayed for in the plaint.

It is against this Judgment the 2nd and 3rd defendants have

preferred this appeal.

When this matter came up before me for argument on

26.07.2018, the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd

defendant-appellants informed Court that he confines his

argument only to the question of res judicata.

The plaintiffs in the plaint did not mention a word about case

No. 17478/L, which the 2nd and 3rd defendants disclosed in their

statement of claim. However, the 1st plaintiff during the course

of cross examination admitted the said case. The case record

was marked as 2V1-2V5 through the 1st plaintiff without any

objection.

According to 2V1-2V5, there cannot be any dispute that the said

case was filed by the same three plaintiffs against the 2nd and 3rd

defendants on the same basis seeking virtually the same reliefs.

That is, the 3rd plaintiff is entitled to share of the land subject

to the life interest of the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs and the 2nd and 3rd

defendants are in forceful occupation of the land. The reliefs

sought were declaration of title, ejectment and damages. In

other words, the difference between the two cases are that the

earlier one was a declaration of title action and the present one

is a partition action. However, the plaintiffs action in the earlier

case was dismissed with costs on 13.05.1985 due to want of

appearance of the plaintiffs on the trial date in terms of section

4

87(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Thereafter, the plaintiffs, in

terms of section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure Code, have made an

application to get that order vacated, but the Court has, by order

dated 07.10.1985, refused that application. The plaintiffs have

hurriedly filed this action 16 days after the said orderi.e. on

23.10.1985.

Section 87(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Where an action has been dismissed under this section, the

plaintiff shall be precluded from bringing a fresh action in

respect of the same cause of action.

It is in that context the 2nd and 3rd defendants have stated that

the matter is res judicata between the plaintiffs and the 2nd and

3rd defendants.1 This is in fact not res judicata in the true

academic sense, but a positive bar for the institution of a fresh

action on the same cause of action.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondents in the written

submissions has cited Herath v. Attorney General2 to say that

decree of dismissal under section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code

on non-appearance of the plaintiff (which is similar to section 87

of the present Code) does not operate as res judicata. It is

relevant to note that as the Civil Procedure Code stood at that

time, there was no similar provision in the Civil Procedure Code

as the present section 87(2), which was introduced by Act No. 20

of 1977.

I could not find a decided case where the present issue has been

directly dealt with, i.e., whether the dismissal of a declaration of

title action on non-appearance of the plaintiff operates as a bar

for the subsequent filing of a partition action.

However, I found a caseDe Silva v. Juwa3where it has been

decided that:

The abatement of an action for declaration of title to land is

a bar against the institution of an action for partition in

respect of the land where the same question of title is

involved.

Insofar as the question of abatement is concerned, as the Civil

Procedure Code stood at that time, there was (and still is) a

similar provision as section 87(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

That is section 403, which reads as follows:

When an action abates or is dismissed under this Chapter,

no fresh action shall be brought on the same cause of

action.

The learned District Judge has taken the view that the cause of

action in the earlier declaration of title action and the present

partition action is not the same. In this regard, in De Silva v.

Juwa (supra) the Supreme Court at pages 166-167 stated as

follows:

But is the action brought on the same cause of action?

The cause of action in the earlier proceedings in case No.

2,680 was the denial by the defendant of the plaintiff's

claim to be the owner of these premises, the question at

issue then being whether the plaintiff or the defendant was

the true owner of the entirety of this land. As a result of the

respondent's intervention in this action, identically the same

question arises for decision and the plaintiff when he

instituted this action must have realized that unless he was

completely successful in his subterfuge that was the

question which would arise for determination immediately

notice of the pendency of this proceeding reached the

intervenient. Inasmuch as he is now a defendant that is the

one question which arises for determination. It is quite true

that in theory an action for partition is a proceeding

between co-owners, the purpose of which is to resolve their

respective interests in common into holdings in severalty.

But in a large percentage, perhaps too large a percentage,

of cases what the Court has to determine is the respective

rights of parties who are frequently if not generally in

conflict as to such rights. In such cases a proceeding

instituted under the Partition Ordinance is in substance,

and I think in fact, an action for a declaration of title.

Though in form actions for partition they are often in reality

actions for a declaration of title to land. In Ponamma v.

Arumugam [8 NLR 223], the Privy Council held that a

certain action for partition brought under the provisions of

the Partition Ordinance though in form an action for

partition was in reality an action for the recovery of the land

and as such was obnoxious to the provisions of section 547

of the Civil Procedure Code which prevented such an action

7

being maintained until administration to the estate had

been obtained.

The cause of action upon which a partition action is based is

inconvenience of common ownership.4 However did the plaintiffs

file the partition action to achieve that objective? In the facts

and circumstances of this case, they did not. There was no

dispute between the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant regarding

ownership or possession of the land. When the plaintiffs

conclusively failed to eject the 2nd and 3rd defendants by filing a

declaration of title action, immediately after the final decision,

they filed this partition action, to achieve the same objective and

not to end co-ownership between the plaintiffs and the 1st

defendant. This is nothing but abusing the provisions of the

Partition Law to achieve the ulterior motive of the plaintiffs,

which is the ejectment of the 2nd and 3rd defendants from the

land.5

In my view, the learned District Judge was wrong when she

answered issue Nos. 11 and 12 in the negative. The plaintiffs

action shall fail.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court and allow the

appeal of the 2nd and 3rd defendants with costs both here and

the Court below.
