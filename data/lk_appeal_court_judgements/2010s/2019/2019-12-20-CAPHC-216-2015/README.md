K.K.WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Kurunegala dated 12.11.20 J 5 in Case No. HCR 93/2011 and the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of Rambodagalla dated 25.11.2011 in Case No 9939. At the stage of argument, both parties agreed to dispose this case by way of written submissions and to abide by the same.

Facts of the Case:

The son of the registered owner (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused') of the vehicle in question bearing No: LF71S7 (hereinafter referred to as the 'vehicle') was charged in the Magistrate's Court of Rambodagalla for transporting sawn timber worth of Rs. J ,92161.55/= on or about 04.0S.20 11, utilizing the abovementioned vehicle and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 25 read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended). The accused has pleaded guilty to the charge and the Learned Magistrate has convicted him and imposed a fine ofRs. 50,000/=on the accused.

Thereafter, a vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the Lorry bearing number No. LF71S7 and the petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') claimed the vehicle in the said inquiry. At conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by order dated 25.11.2011.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Kurunegala and the same was dismissed by the Learned High Court Judge on12.11.2015.

Thereafter, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended in the written submission dated

11.09.2019, that in the revision application, bearing No: HCR 93/2011 to the High Court of the North western Province, KurunegaJa, the petitioner has tendered that he had taken all precautions in order to prevent the crime. It is stated that the

accused was her son who was a trusted persoo who had no previous convictions; the lorry was parked at night at the residence of the petitioner; the absolute owner and the petitioner advised the son not to use the vehicle for any purpose other than the transport of rubble and the petitioner visited the quarry to verify whether the lorry had come.

For the purpose of deciding whether the Learned Magistrate and the Learned judge of the high Court have erred in law, the law in relation to the confiscation order should be diligently analysed.

As per section 40(1)(b) of the Forest Ordinance as amended, all tools, vehicles,

implements, cattle and machines used in committing an offence under the Forest Ordinance, shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate. Therefore it is trite law that any vehicle involved in an offence under the Forest Ordinance is subject to confiscation upon a valid conviction. It is observed that the amendment made to section 40 of the Forest Ordinance in 2009, requires Court to look into the preventive measures taken by the vehicle owner whose vehicle is involved in an offence under Forest Ordinance.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. v. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeal105A12008], it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio decidendi of

all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has to establish

the said matter on a balance of probability. " (Emphasis added)

It should be analysed whether the vehicle owner, the appellant had taken all

precautions to prevent the commission of the act by her son.

The Learned Magistrate has observed in the ju,dgement :

The Learned Magistrate and the Learned High court judge, in the light of decided

judgements, have analysed as to what actions constitute to be the precautionary

actions.

I wish to draw the attention to the landmark case decided on a similar matter The

Finance Private Ltd. v Agampodi Mahapedige Priyantha Chandana and

others in Supreme Court Appeal No.105A12008 decided on 30.09.2010 Her

Ladyship the Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake has stated

"it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as

amended if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third party, no order of

confiscation shall be made if that owner has proved to the satisfaction of the court

that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the said vehicle for the

commission of the offence. The ratio decidendi of all therefore mentioned decisions

also show that the owner has to establish the said matter on balance of

probability "

Furthermore it was stated in the abovementioned judgment that,

"As has been clearly illustrated by several decisions referred to above, it

would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that the vehicle that

had been used for the commission of the offence had been so used without his

knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions available to prevent the

use of the vehicle for the commission of such an offence. "

The Learned Magistrate has correctly stated ~n his judgment that even in the case

of an absol ute owner, mere ignorance of the commission by the absolute owner is

not sufficient to depict that the owner had taken all possible and feasible measures

to prevent the crime.

Since the section 40 of the Forest ordinance states that no Order of Confiscation

shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had

taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle

and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence. It should be

analysed whether the Learned Magistrate Court judge has properly analysed if

the owners of the vehicle have taken proper and all possible precautions to prevent

the commission of the offence.

The Learned Magistrate has correctly pointed out in the brief that the witness who

testified on behalf of the absolute owner had not been able to prove that they had

taken all preventive precautionary measures to prevent the commission of the

offence to the satisfaction of the court. Furthermore the Learned judge has

mentioned that the abovementioned witness has contradicted his evidence and

hence his evidence is not trustworthy for the court to believe, thereby the

conclusion of the court is that the absolute owner had not taken any steps to

prevent the commission of the offence. (page 226 of the brief)

Furthermore the Learned Judge in his judgement has mentioned the Registered

owner also has contradicted herself during the cross examination. (page 227 of the

brief)

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva leA (PHC) 86/97], it was

held that.

"For these reasons I hold that giving mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were in

fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the instructions. "

In the case of Faris V. The Officer ID charge, Police Station,

Galenbindunuwewa and another (1992) 1 S.L.R. 167, it was held that,

" ... an order for confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of two

matters. They are:

I. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence;

II. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without

his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes anyone of these matters on a

balance of probability, an order for confiscation should not be made ... "

Moreover as law stands today, it is mandatory to prove preventive measures taken

by a vehicle owner in question, on a balance of probability. Undoubtedly, such

burden would not be discharged merely because the owner in question did not have

knowledge about an offence being committed or because the vehicle was not

involved in an offence previo).lsly. The Learned Magistrate had correctly analyzed

this question and came to the conclusion that the appellant was not monitoring the

vehicle cautiously because loading of the timber stock has been taken place nearby

to the house of the registered owner. The Learned Magistrate has correctly pointed

out that

The learned High Court Judge has elaborated on the fact that the registered owner

has not taken sufficient precautionary measures to prevent the crime happening and

if she was vigilant enough about the fact she could have prevented the commission

of the said crime. Even though the registered owner has stated that she gave

instructions to her son to refrain from committing any offence using the vehicle,

she has not been able to prove that she took all possible precautionary measures to

prevent the commission of th" said offence.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd.

(2003) 3 SLR 24,

Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court selects

the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification should be

adopted. If such a selection process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this

court will become a gateway of every litigant.to make a second appeal in the garb

of a Revision application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature

has not given a right of appeal ... "

Therefore the revisionary powers of this Court shall not be exercised when there

was no illegality, irregularity or failure of justice in aforesaid orders. I observe that

in the present case also there had been no miscarriage of justice, irregularity or

injustice in the order of the Learned Magistrate and therefore the Learned High

Court Judge was correct in refusing to interfere with the order of the Learned

Magistrate due to absence of exceptional circumstances. Upon perusal of the both

orders, I am satisfied that both the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court

Judge had made well-reasoned orders, following due procedure and I affirm both

orders of the Learned Magistrate dated 25.11.2011 and the Learned High Court

Judge Galle dated 12.1l.2015.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed without costs.
