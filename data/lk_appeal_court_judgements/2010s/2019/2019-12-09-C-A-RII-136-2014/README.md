Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action against the two Defendants in the

District Court of Colombo in 1991, seeking to recover a sum of

Rs. 2,352,978/80 with legal interest from the 1st Defendant,

arising out of an Agreement entered into between the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff also sought a declaration

that the 1st Defendant is not entitled to make a demand on the

Performance Bond submitted by the Plaintiff to the 1st

Defendant, issued by the 2nd Defendant Bank.

The 1st Defendant filed the answer seeking dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action. The 1st Defendant sought to dissolve the

interim injunction issued, preventing the 2nd Defendant from

paying monies to the 1st Defendant on the said Performance

Bond. The 1st Defendant also made a claim in reconvention to

recover a sum of Rs. 1,626,616/05 from the Plaintiff, arising out

of the same Agreement, as damages.

After trial, the learned District Judge entered Judgment for the

Plaintiff granting all the reliefs sought, and the claims of the 1st

Defendant were rejected.

Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment of the District Court,

the 1st Defendant has preferred an appeal to this Court. After

the argument, and written submissions being filed by all parties,

this Court, by Judgment dated 29.04.2008, has partly allowed

the appeal.1 The conclusion of the said Judgment reads as

follows:

In the result, therefore I shall partly allow the appeal. The

decision of the learned District Judge is varied only with regard to

the claim on the Bank Guarantee. Therefore the issues No.13 and

17 should be answered in the affirmative. I award no costs.

The effect of answering issue Nos. 13 and 17 is the 1st Defendant

becoming entitled to receive a sum of Rs.876,616/05 with legal

interest from the 2nd Defendant on the said Performance Bond

and/or from the Plaintiff.2

Neither the Plaintiff nor the 2nd Defendant has sought special

leave to appeal from the Supreme Court against this Judgment.

However, as the appeal was only partly allowed, the 1st

Defendant has sought special leave to appeal against this

Judgment from the Supreme Court. After hearing counsel for

the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff, the Supreme Court by order

1 Vide the Judgment at pages 17-24 of the brief. 2 For issue Nos.13 and 17 vide pages 460-461 of the brief.

dated 20.01.2009 has refused to grant special leave to appeal.3

In the same order, the Supreme Court has stated that, upon the

Judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal, the interim order

made staying the payment on the Performance Bond would

lapse automatically. This means the 1st Defendant can make the

claim on the Performance Bond from the 2nd Defendant.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff, by way of a motion dated 19.05.2009,

has sought clarification from the Supreme Court on the basis

that, in view of the Final Bill submitted by the Plaintiff to the 1st

Defendant, the 1st Defendant has no right to claim any sum

under the Performance Bond, as the Plaintiff had given due

credit to the total amount in the Performance Bond to the 1st

Defendant.4

But, the Supreme Court by order dated 27.07.2009 has stated

that no clarification is necessary, and with the refusal of special

leave, the Judgment of the Court of Appeal would be operative.5

Then, there cannot be any doubt that the 1st Defendant can

make the claim on the Performance Bond from the 2nd

Defendant.

Nearly five years after the last Supreme Court order, the Plaintiff

has filed this restitutio in integrum/revision application seeking

to revise the Judgment of this Court delivered on 29.04.2008, by

answering issue Nos. 13 and 17 in the negative (as the District

Judge had done), because the conclusion of the Judgment of

this Court is inconsistent with the body of the Judgment.

I do not think I need to give any more reasons to refuse that

relief. The Plaintiff wants the present Bench to overturn the

Judgment of a previous Bench. Answering issue Nos.13 and 17

in the affirmative, which had been answered by the District

Judge in the negative, was the only substantive decision made

by this Court in the Judgment dated 29.04.2008. By that

decision, the appeal of the 1st Defendant was partly allowed.

If the Plaintiff was dissatisfied with that Judgment of this Court,

he would have gone before the Supreme Court. But he did not.

Conversely, the 1st Defendant went before the Supreme Court for

not allowing his appeal in full, but the Supreme Court declined

to interfere with the Judgment of this Court.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff has gone before the Supreme Court, in

my view, to get the Judgment of this Court revised, in the guise

of seeking clarification, but the Supreme Court has declined it.

I think the matter shall end there.

As Chief Justice Sansoni stated in Cassim v. Government Agent,

Batticaloa, There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect

orders have to go unreversed.6

The 2nd Defendant cannot refuse to honour the unconditional and

on demand Performance Bond for the reasons stated in the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal. The 2nd Defendant has no right

to interpret the said Judgment of this Court or to get involved in

the dispute between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. The

Performance Bond is a separate Agreement only between the

Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant Bank. 6 (1966) 69 NLR 403 at 404. This was cited by Rajaratnam J. in Wickremasekera v. Ganegoda (President, Labour Tribunal) (1973) 76 NLR 452 at 454.

The order of the District Court dated 05.02.2014 is affirmed7 and

the amended decree dated 09.01.2013 signed by the District Judge

shall be executed.8

The application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
