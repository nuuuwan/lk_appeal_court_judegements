This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Negombo dated

01.06.2000.

The Plaintiff- Appellant (Plaintiff) instituted the above styled action in his capacity as a liquidator

under Section 276 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 in the District Court of Negombo seeking

inter alia a declaration of title to the allotments of land more fully described in the schedule to

the plaint dated 10.10.1995 [Page 35 of the Appeal Brief].

Page 2 of 11

The Defendant-Respondent (Defendant) filed answer dated 16.05.1997 and claimed that the said

property was mortgaged by the Plaintiff to the People's Bank under 3 mortgage bonds and due

to the default of payment of the Plaintiff, the People's Bank sold the property in a public auction

to a nominee (as there were no bidders) who later transferred the property to the Defendant (by

endorsing the certificate of sale issued to the nominee), who then became the owner of the said

property.

Further, it was claimed that there has already been a lawsuit (D. C. Colombo Case No. 2576/SPL)

relating to the same matters sought to be canvassed by the above styled action, the judgment of

which was appealed in C. A. Revision Application No. 584/93, Leave to Appeal Application No. L.

A. 172/93 and S. C. Spl. L.A. Application No. 144/94. The Defendant took up the pOSition that the

proceedings and the judgment of the said lawsuit operate as res judicata between the parties and

that the Plaintiff has not followed the procedure laid down in C. A. Revision Application No.

584/93 when instituting the above styled action.

When the matter was taken up for trial on 18.11.1998, both parties inter alia admitted that late

K. Sachithananda, the former liquidator (the predecessor of the Plaintiff) and the Defendant were

parties in D. C. Colombo Case No. 2576/SPL, C. A. Revision Application No. 584/93 and Leave to

Appeal Application No. L. A. 172/93.

14 issues were raised on behalf of both parties and it was agreed that the following issues be

tried as preliminary issues of law-

The learned District Judge of Negombo answered issue No. 09 in the affirmative and decided that

the Plaintiff cannot maintain the above styled action and hence, th is appeal.

Page 3 of 11

It is agreed between the parties that the principal matter to be determined is whether the order

in D. C. Colombo Case No. 2576/SPL and the decision thereon of the Court of Appeal in C. A.

Revision Application No. 584/93 and the confirmation thereof by the Supreme Court in S. C. Spl.

L.A. Application No. 144/94 operate as res judicata between the parties.

Necessary Constituents for Res Judicata

Both parties relied on the following extract from E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, Law af Evidence (Page

528 of Vol. I, 2nd Edition) which sets out the elements that must be established in order to

establish a plea of res judicata -

(i) The former action must have been a regular action.

(ii) The two actions must be between the same parties or their representatives in interest

(privies).

(iii) The previous judgment must be a final judgment.

(iv) The same question or identical causes of action must have been involved in both actions.

(v) The judicial tribunal pronouncing the decision must have had competent jurisdiction in

that behalf.

(vi) The previous decision must be what in law is deemed such.

(vii) The particular judicial decision must have been in fact pronounced as alleged.

(viii) The judgment should not have been obtained by fraud or collusion.

(ix) If it is a foreign judgment, it should have been passed in accordance with the principles

of natural justice.

(x) The correctness of the decision is not a relevant consideration.

Parties were at variance on some of these elements which will now be considered.

(i) THE FORMER ACTION MUST HAVE BEEN A REGULAR ACTION

The Appellant contends that the former action is not a regular action but an interim application

[Page 5 of the Written Submissions dated 27.05.2013).

The original action (Case No. 2576/SPL) instituted in the District Court of Colombo by the E. H.

Cooray & Sons Limited was to wind up Sun Cornel Textiles Limited under the provisions of

Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. On 13.11.1986, the court ordered the winding up of Sun Cornel

Textiles Limited.

Page 4 of 11

Thereafter, on 08.07.1991, an application was made by way of a petition by Cornel & Company

Limited (a creditor of the Sun Cornel Textiles Limited) praying for an order declaring the sale of

the property in dispute by the People's Bank to the Respondent as ineffective and null and void

and to place the said property in the custody of the liquidator.

In Subramaniam Chetty v. Soysa (25 N.L.R. 344) the Supreme Court held that an application made

to a court in the course of, and incidental to, an action in summary procedure is, regarded by the

code as itself being an action.

In this context I note that the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 did not set out the procedure which

needs to be followed when making an incidental application in winding up proceedings. The only

requirement is that the application must be made by way of petition.

The question to be considered here is whether the said application constitutes a regular action

upon a consideration of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Civil Procedure Code.

An "action" is a proceeding for the prevention or redress of a wrong [Section 5 of the Civil

Procedure Code]. Every application to a court for relief or remedy obtainable through the exercise

of the court's power or authority, or otherwise to invite its interference, constitutes an action

[Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code]. The procedure of an action may be either "Regular" or

"Summary". [Section 7 ofthe Civil Procedure Code].

Save and except actions in which it is by this Ordinance or any law especially provided that

proceedings may be taken by way of summary procedure, every action shall commence and

proceed by a course of regular procedure, as hereinafter prescribed [Section 8 of the Civil

Procedure Code].

This appears prima facie to indicate that section 8 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for the

application of regular procedure in two situations namely where:

(i) The Civil Procedure Code does not provide for summary procedure

(ii) Any other law does not provide for summary procedure

Page 5 of 11

However, the learned President's Counsel for the Respondent submitted that regular procedure

applies even where a law does not provide for any other procedure. He relied on the decision in

D.H.S. Jayawardene v. R.K. Obeyesekere and Others [S.C. (CHC) Appeal 21-23/2009; S.C.M.

21.03.2011] where JAN. De Silva c.J. held (at page 6):

"It was then submitted that the procedure found in section 520 of the Companies Act 7

of 2007 did not fall into either category and therefore the procedure laid down in the Civil

Procedure Code should not apply in respect of disputes arising out of the Companies Act.

Section 8 which was inserted into the Civil Procedure Code as an amendment in 1980

states that unless specifically provided, proceedings should be by way of "regular"

procedure.

The Civil Procedure Code itself, despite the wording in section 7 paves the way for another

type of proceedings i.e. found in chapter VIII to be followed in respect of liquid claims. The

procedure set out therein is distinctly different to the "regular" procedure as well as the

"summary" procedure already referred to.

Therefore, I think it would be unwise to contend that a procedure found in a statute alien

to the forms found in the Civil Procedure Code would not attract the provisions relating

to the regular procedure of the Civil Procedure Code.

The legislature may have in its wisdom adopted various procedures to be followed in

relation to the diverse actions which it deems appropriate.

Yet unless the operation and the application of the Civil Procedure Code is expressly

prevented, I am of the opinion that the regular procedure of the civil procedure must be

applied in terms of section 8.

Section 8 states,

Save and except actions in which it is by this Ordinance or any other law specially

provided that proceedings may be taken by way of summary procedure, every

action shall commence and proceed by a course of regular procedure, as

hereinafter prescribed.

In other words, section 8 of the Civil Procedure Code should be understood as providing

for the application of regular procedure where, a) The Civil Procedure Code does not

Page 6 of 11

provide for summary procedure b) Any other law does not provide for summary

procedure c) Where a law does not provide for any other procedure.

I am therefore convinced that the proceedings under scrutiny was found to be an action

in which, in addition to the application of the general procedure found in the Companies

Act, the regular procedure found in the Civil Procedure Code must fill any procedural

lacuna."

Applying the above ratio I hold that the application made on 08.07.1991 by way of a petition by

Cornel & Company Limited (a creditor of the Sun Cornel Textiles Limited) praying for an order

declaring the sale of the property in dispute by the People's Bank to the Respondent as ineffective

and null and void and to place the said property in the custody of the liquidator is a regular action.

(ii) THE TWO ACTIONS MUST BE BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN

INTEREST (PRIVIES)

The contention of the Appellant is that the previous case was not between the parties to the

present case but between the E. H. Cooray & Sons Limited and Cornel & Company Limited [Page

5 ofthe Written Submissions dated 27.05.2013]. The Appellant relied on Dharmadasa v. Piyadasa

Perera (64 N.L.R. 249) in which it was held that a decree absolute for default that has been passed

against a defendant by a District Court is one to which Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code

applies and can, therefore, operate as res judicata in a subsequent action between the same

parties in respect ofthe same subject matter.

It was further stated that the previous application was preferred by a creditor of the company

(Cornel & Company Limited) whereas the present application was instituted by the liquidator of

the company [Written Submissions dated 30.06.2014].

As mentioned above, both parties inter alia admitted that late K. Sachithananda, the former

liqUidator (the predecessor of the Appellant) and the Respondent were parties in D. C. Colombo

Case No. 2576/SPL, C. A. Revision Application No. 584/93 and Leave to Appeal Application No. L.

A. 172/93 [Page 46 ofthe Appeal Brief] .

Also, a careful perusal of the available pleadings/proceedings of the previous case (D. C. Colombo

Case No. 2576/SPL) shows that even though the Respondent was not made a party to the

application made by Cornel & Company Limited (a creditor of the Sun Cornel Textiles Limited) on

Page 7 of 11

08.07.1991, Messrs. L. M. Apparels (Private) Limited (the predecessor of the Respondent) was

later added as a Respondent to the said application [Pages 92 and 95 of the Appeal Brief].

A party is a person whose name appears on the record at the time of the decision [Jujjuvarapu

Katamma v. Pappala Simhachalam and Ors AIR 1969 AP 76]. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that

Messrs. L. M. Apparels (Private) Limited (the predecessor of the Respondent) was a party to the

previous case.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, Law of Evidence (Page 529 of Vol. I, 2nd Edition) states that it is

immaterial that a person is plaintiff in one action and defendant in the other. But it is essential

that the party must act in the same capacity or character. In other words, the party who instituted

the previous action is not required to institute the subsequent action.

Hence, I see no merit in the contention of the Appellant that the previous application was

preferred by a creditor of the company whereas the present application was instituted by the

liquidator of the company.

Accordingly, I hold that the two actions are between the same parties and/or their

representatives in interest (privies).

(iii) THE PREVIOUS JUDGMENT MUST BE A FINAL JUDGMENT

When establishing a plea of res judicata, another aspect to be considered is whether the previous

judgment is a final judgment.

In Siriwardena v. Air Ceylan Limited [(1984) 1 SrLL.R. 286] Sharvananda, J.laid down the following

tests to be applied to determine whether an order has the effect of a final judgment-

1. It must be an order finally disposing of the rights of the parties.

2. The order cannot be treated as a final order, if the suit or the action is still left a live suit

or action for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of the parties in the

ordinary way.

3. The finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit.

4. The mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even a vital and

important issue determined in the case, is not enough to make an order a final one.

Accordingly, if the order has the effect of finally disposing of the rights of the parties, it has the

effect of a final judgment.

Page 8 of 11

The question to be considered here is whether the actual matter in dispute between the parties

has been finally concluded or in other words whether the order of the Additional District Judge

of Colombo dated 01.06.1993 and the decision thereon of the Court of Appeal in C. A. Revision

Application No. 584/93 and the confirmation thereof by the Supreme Court (in S. C. Spl. L.A.

Application No. 144/94) have the effect of finally disposing the rights of the parties.

The actual matter in dispute between the parties is the ownership of the property more fully

described in the schedule to the plaint dated 10.10.1995.

The application/petition made by the Cornel & Company Limited on 08.07.1991 was to obtain an

order declaring the sale of the said property by the People's Bank to the Respondent ineffective,

null and void and to place the said property in the custody of the liquidator. It was further stated

in the said application/petition that the said property belongs to the company under liquidation

(Sun Cornel Textiles Limited).

The instant action was instituted seeking inter alia a declaration of title to the same property.

Both parties made extensive submissions on the question whether the judgment of this Court in

in L.M. Apparels (Pvt) Limited v. E.H. Cooray & Sons Limited and Others [CO A. Revision Application

No. 584/93, C.A.M. 25.03.1994J and the refusal ofthe Supreme Court for special leave to appeal

against the said judgment in Cornel & Company Limited v. E.H. Cooray & Sons Limited and Others

[S.c. Spl. L.A. 144/94, S.C.M. 29.08.1994J amounts to a decision on the merits.

I hold that it is a final judgment and wish to quote the following extracts from the judgment of S.

N. Silva, J. (President C.A. as he was then) in support:

"In this case a resolution had been validly passed for the sale of property by public

auction, prior to the operative date namely the commencement of the winding up.

Therefore, a question arises whether this property could be considered a property of the

company that may be disposed of by the company. Further legal issue arises in relation to

constituent element (3). Is the sale affected by the Bank pursuant to the resolution, a

disposition which comes within the purview of this element?" (Emphasis added) [Appeal

Brief Pages 154,5J.

"The property in question ceased to be the property of the company, upon the

certificate of sale dated 7.4.1986 (P1) being issued in terms of section 59 of the State

Mortgage and Investment Bank law, in favour of the nominee of the Bank. In the

Page 9 of 11

circumstances the provisions of section 260 will apply if at all in relation to that sale."

(Emphasis added) [Appeal Brief Pages 158,9J.

The application for the grant of special leave to appeal against the said judgment was refused by

the Supreme Court.

Accordingly, I hold that the actual matter in dispute between the parties is finally concluded and

the decision ofthe Court of Appeal in C. A. Revision Application No. 584/93 has the effect offinally

disposing the rights of the parties.

(iv) THE SAME QUESTION OR IDENTICAL CAUSES OF ACTION MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN

BOTH ACTIONS.

The next requirement to be considered is whether the same question or identical causes of action

have been involved in both actions.

The contention of the Appellant is that the cause of action of the previous case was to secure the

rights of the creditor under Section 260 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 whereas the

subsequent action is to implement the duties of a liquidator under Section 276 of the said Act.

Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code defines a "cause of action" as follows-

"The wrong for the prevention or redress of which on action may be brought, and includes

the denial af a right, the refusal to fulfill an obligation, the neglect to perform a duty and

the infliction of an affirmative injury. "

The wrong is the combination ofthe right and its violation [Lowe v. Fernanda et al (16 N.L.R. 398)J.

For the purpose of determining whether or not two causes of action are the same, what we have

to look is not the mere form in which the action is brought, but the grounds of the plaint, and the

media on which the plaintiff asks for judgment [Dingiri Menika v. Punchi Mahatmaya et al (13

N.L.R. 59)].

In Allagasamy v. The Kalutaro Co. Limited et al (14 N.L.R. 262) Lascelles, C. J. (citing De Grey, C. J.

in Kitchen v. Campbell 2 W. BI. 827) held that a great criterion of the identity of causes of action

is that the same evidence will maintain both actions.

As I observed earlier, the previous case was brought by the Cornel & Company Limited to obtain

an order declaring the sale of the aforementioned property by the People's Bank to the

Respondent is ineffective, null and void and to place the said property in the custody of the

Page 10 of 11

..

liquidator. The instant action was instituted seeking inter alia a declaration of title to the same

property.

In the previous case, the Cornel & Company Limited prayed for a declaration of nullity of sale on

the ground that the property belongs to the Sun Cornel Textiles Limited and the sale by the

People's Bank is ineffective as the property was sold in public auction subsequent to the

commencement of the winding up procedure. Hence, it is clear that the cause of action of the

previous case revolves around the ownership of the said property.

I disagree with the contention of the Appellant that the cause of action of the previous case was

to secure the rights of the creditor under Section 260 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982

whereas the subsequent action is to implement the duties of a liquidator under Section 276 of

the said Act. The ultimate purpose of placing property belonging to a company to be wound up

in the custody of a liquidator is to secure the rights of the creditors. At the end of the winding up

proceedings, the property placed in the custody of the liquidator will be sold in order to settle

the debts of the company being wound up.

I hold that the same question or identical causes of action have been involved in both actions.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment ofthe learned District

Judge of Negombo dated 01.06.2000.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
