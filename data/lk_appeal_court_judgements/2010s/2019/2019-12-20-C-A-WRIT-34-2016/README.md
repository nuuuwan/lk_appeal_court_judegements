There was a grievance on the part of the 5th respondent, a

former employee of the petitioner, that he had not been given the

due promotion from Store Keeper Grade II to Store Keeper Grade

I in spite of his passing the competitive examination held on

14.07.2002.

On the recommendation of the Commissioner General of Labour,

the Minister of Labour, acting in terms of section 4(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, as amended, referred

the dispute to the 4th respondent arbitrator for arbitration.

The arbitrator held an inquiry into the matter where both parties

were fully heard. It is after the said inquiry that the impugned

award was made by the arbitrator. By that award the petitioner

was directed to promote the 5th respondent to Class I and place

him on the relevant salary scale and pay the arrears of salary

until his date of retirement and arrears of pension thereafter.

There is no complaint that the petitioner was not given a fair

hearing, or the arbitrator was biased, or there was a procedural

irregularity in conducing the inquiry or the like. The sole ground

upon which the petitioner challenges the said award is that the

arbitrator did not properly evaluate the evidenceboth oral and

documentaryled before him, thereby arriving at conclusions

not supported by evidence. It is on this basis the petitioner

states that the award is irrational and/or arbitrary and/or illegal

and/or ultra vires and/or null and void. The petitioner also

states that there is an error on the face of the record.1

1 It is interesting to note that the petitioner has cited almost all the grounds in general. Vide paragraphs 13-15 of the petition.

The 1st and 3rd respondents filed objections to this application.

At the argument before this Court, on behalf of the petitioner,

brief oral submissions were made followed by written

submissions. However, no submissionsoral or writtenhave

been made on behalf of the respondents.

It is the contention of the petitioner (in the written submissions)

that although the 5th respondent was successful at the

competitive examination, he could not be promoted to Grade I,

as he did not fulfil the criteria set out in circulars marked R1,

R16 and R17.2

In the first place, I must state that only R1 is a circular; the

other two are not.3

It is not the complaint of the petitioner that the arbitrator

ignored the alleged circulars. The said circulars were placed

before the arbitrator at the inquiry and the 5th respondent was

cross examined on them at length. By reading the impugned

award it is clear that the arbitrator considered them in reaching

his decision.

Whilst the petitioner was serving as a Store Keeper Grade II, the

5th respondent was arrested and then indicted in the High Court

for accepting a bribe. Then, the 5th respondents services were

suspended. However, he was later acquitted by the High Court

and reinstated with back wages.4 By the time he was

suspended, he had passed the competitive examination for

promotion. It appears there is a training successful officers

undergo before they are given the promotion. The eleven Grade II

officers who passed the examination together with the 5th

respondent had been given the training during the 5th

respondents period of suspension and their promotions have

been given. It appears that the training was for only one week.

After reinstatement upon acquittal from the High Court case, the

5th respondent worked in the CEB (the petitioner) for more than

one year and two months before retirement.

During this period, the 5th respondent made several requests to

the petitioner to grant him the promotion. He complained to the

Commissioner General of Labour, the Human Rights

Commission etc. about this matter.

At that stage, the petitioners only defence was that the 5th

respondent could not be given the promotion because he had

not undergone the training5, which is, according to the

petitioner, a sine qua non for the promotion to be granted. Both

the Commissioner of Labour6 and the Human Rights

Commission7 directed/recommended the promotion be granted,

as it is the responsibility of the employer to give the required

training to the 5th respondent.

It seems that the petitioner took up the new position, i.e. the 5th

respondent has not satisfied the other requirements stated in

R1, R16 and R17, for the first time before the arbitrator.

5 Vide page 394 of P1. 6 Vide page 391-393 of P1. 7 Vide pages 395-397 of P1.

The petitioner says that according to the internal circular R1,

the 5th respondent should have earned all the increments during

the preceding three years to be eligible for the promotion, but

the 5th respondent did not get the increment for one year due to

his admission of guilt involving a false medical claim.

R16 and R17 are not circulars: they are guidelines to be used in

granting promotions.

According to R16, to be eligible for promotion the officer should

not have been punished in the preceding three years.

It appears there has not been a consistent policy in granting

promotions, and the petitioner has not been very serious in

issuing guidelines. For instance, there is a vast difference

between denial of an increment as a punishment in the

preceding three years, and any punishment in the preceding

three years.

In regard to the matter of making a false medical claim, as the

arbitrator in the award has stated, there is no document which

says the 5th respondent pleaded guilty to the charge. The

petitioner in the written submission points to R3 in that regard.8

This document shows that the disciplinary inquiry regarding the

false medical claim was suspended because the 5th respondent

expressed his willingness to pay back the money he obtained by

tendering false receipts.

The arbitrator has taken the view that it is not proper to punish

an officer without holding a disciplinary inquiry and also not

8 Vide page 417 in P1.

proper to take into account a punishment given in such

circumstances when granting a promotion. The arbitrator, as I

will explain below, is entitled to take such a view. It is not illegal.

The said punishment (denial of an increment and deprivation of

health insurance benefits for 5 years) was given before the 5th

respondent had been granted permission to sit for the

competitive examination. The arbitrator in the award has taken

the view that, if that punishment is a positive bar to the

promotion, the petitioner should not have recommended the 5th

respondent to sit for the examination.

Another allegation brought against the 5th respondent before the

arbitrator was shortages and excesses in stocks in the stores.

This stock taking was done in the absence of the 5th respondent

when he had been under interdiction. According to the

petitioner, this shows the failure on the part of the 5th

respondent to properly maintain an inventory.9 As the arbitrator

has stated in the award, if the 5th respondent committed a

serious offence, a disciplinary inquiry should have been held on

that matter upon a charge sheet. No such inquiry was held.

Some money had been deducted from the 5th respondents salary

in this regard and was later returned withholding a small

amount. The petitioner states this was done on humanitarian

grounds.

In reference to R17, the petitioner states that to be promoted in

the service of store keeper, a person shall pass an interview.10

9 Vide paragraph 2.20 of the written submission. 10 Vide paragraph 2.25 of the written submission.

The 5th respondent did not have any control over this. It is the

responsibility of the employer to call for interviews.

The petitioner, both in the petition and in the written

submission, has stated that unless the award marked P2 is

quashed, irreparable loss and damage would be caused to the

petitioner. There is no meaning to that claim. Rejection of the

application will not cause irreparable loss and damage to the

petitioner.

Having considered all matters, the arbitrator has decided to

grant reliefs to the 5th respondent.

Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act reads as follows:

When an industrial dispute has been referred under section

3(1)(d) or section 4(1) to an arbitrator for settlement by

arbitration, he shall make all such inquiries into the dispute

as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as may

be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter

make such award as may appear to him just and equitable.

A labour tribunal shall give priority to the proceedings for

the settlement of any industrial dispute that is referred to it

for settlement by arbitration.

In Asian Hotels and Properties PLC v. Benjamin [2013] 1 Sri LR

407 at 419, Bandaranayake C.J. whilst referring to section 17(1)

of the Industrial Disputes Act stated:

An Arbitrator, who has been empowered to make such

award should do so, as may appear to him just and

equitable. Section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act, referred

Website Copy Website Copy

to earlier, clearly had granted an unfettered discretion for

the Arbitrator to mete out just and equitable relief.

In Brown & Company PLC v. Minister of Labour [2011] 1 Sri LR

305 at 316-317, Marsoof J. held:

Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to

be even more liberal, informal and flexible than commercial

arbitration, primarily because the Arbitrator is empowered

to make an award which is just and equitable. When an

industrial dispute has been referred under Section 3(1)(d) or

Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act to an Arbitrator

for settlement by arbitration, Section 17(1) of the said Act

requires such Arbitrator to make all such inquiries into the

dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence

as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and

thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and

equitable. In my view, the word make as used in the

said provision, has the effect of throwing the ball in to the

Arbitrators court, so to speak, and requires him to initiate

what inquiries he considers are necessary. The Arbitrator is

not simply called upon to hold an inquiry, where the ball

would be in the court of the parties to the dispute and, it

would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider

necessary requiring the arbitrator to be just a judge

presiding over the inquiry, the control and progress of which

will be in the hands of the parties themselves or their

Counsel. What the Industrial Disputes Act has done

appears to me to be to substitute in place of the rigid

procedures of the law envisaged by the adversarial

Website Copy Website Copy

10

system, a new and more flexible procedure, which is in

keeping with the fashion in which equity in English law

gave relief to the litigants from the rigidity of the common

law. The function of the arbitral power in relation to

industrial disputes is to ascertain and declare what in the

opinion of the Arbitrator ought to be the respective rights

and liabilities of the parties as they exist at the moment the

proceedings are instituted. His role is more inquisitorial,

and he has a duty to go in search for the evidence, and he

is not strictly required to follow the provisions of the

Evidence Ordinance in doing so. Just as much as the

procedure before the arbitrator is not governed by the rigid

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, the procedure

followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the

law.

Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour and Vocational

Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 249, F.N.D. Jayasuriya J.

observed:

Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award made by

an arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award

only if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a

jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeds that which

he has or acts contrary to principles of natural justice or

pronounces an award which is eminently irrational or

unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality. The remedy by

way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or

to substitute a correct order for a wrong order and if the

arbitrator's award was not set aside in whole or in part, it

Website Copy Website Copy

11

had to be allowed to stand unreversed. It is pertinent to

refer to the principles laid down by Prof. H.W.R. Wade on

Administrative Law 12th edition at pages 34 to 35

wherein the learned author states: Judicial review is

radically different from the system of appeals. When

hearing an appeal, the court is concerned with the merits of

the decision under appeal. But in judicial review, the court

is concerned with its legality. On appeal, the question is

right or wrong. On review, the question is lawful or

unlawful..judicial review is a fundamentally different

operation. Instead of substituting its own decision for that

of some other body, as happens when an appeal is

allowed, a court, on review, is concerned only with whether

the act or order under attack should be allowed to stand or

not. In the circumstances the objective of this court upon

judicial review in this application is to strictly consider

whether the whole or part of the award of the arbitrator is

lawful or unlawful. This court ought not to exercise its

appellate powers and jurisdiction when engaged in the

exercise of supervisory jurisdiction and judicial review of an

award of an arbitrator.

The arbitrator is not bound to follow the alleged circulars to the

extreme letter. He shall direct his attention to them, but he is

free to not follow them, by giving reasons, when making a just

and equitable order.

The award of the arbitrator is not perverse. It is, in my view,

coherent. It may well be that the facts of this case can be

interpreted in the manner suggested by the petitioner as well.

12

That shall not be the yardstick to overturn or quash the decision

of the arbitrator by certiorari. What the law requires the

arbitrator to do is to make a just and equitable order at the end

of the day. This the arbitrator has done in this case.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner without costs.
