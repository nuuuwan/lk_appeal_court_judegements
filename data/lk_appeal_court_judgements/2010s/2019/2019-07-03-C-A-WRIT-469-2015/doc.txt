Decided on: 02.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner is a limited liability private company whose

primary object is to carry on the business of cultivating fruits

and vegetables for export market.1 The petitioner says that its

holding company, at the invitation of a local politician of the

Puttalam District made a request to the Divisional Secretary of

Wanathawilluwa to release 25 Acres of State Land to commence

an eco-friendly organic fruit cultivation project as a pilot project.

According to the petitioner, the petitioner was handed over

possession of 25 Acres of State Land in Ralmaduwa Grama

Niladhari Division within the Wanathawilluwa Divisionsl

Secretariat area in early January 19982 by the Divisional

Secretary of Wanathawilluwa3 on the understanding that the

said land would be given to the petitioner on a long Lease. The

petitioner is said to have started the project on or about

1 P1B. 2 Paragraph 7 of the amended petition. 3 Paragraph 5 of the amended petition.

4

06.01.19984, and invested approximately Rs. 30 million on the

project.

There is no documentary proof to the satisfaction of the Court to

ascertain who handed over to the petitioner the possession of 25

Acres of State Land, and when it was done, and how the land of

25 Acres was identified. The drawing marked P12 depicting a

land of 250 Acres is dated 07.10.1998, and the Plan marked

P15A is dated 17.01.2002.

The petitioner then says that immediately thereafter the

petitioner requested the Provincial Commissioner of Lands of the

North Western Province to release 250 Acres inclusive of the

aforesaid 25 Acres to the same project.5 It is not clear, when

(according to the petitioner) 25 Acres have already been handed

over to the petitioner by the Divisional Secretary, why the

petitioner wanted that 25 Acre land also to be handed over by

the Provincial Commissioner of Lands.

The Provincial Commissioner of Lands of the North Western

Province has acted swiftly and directed the Divisional Secretary

of Wanathawilluwa by letter marked P5 dated 27.01.1998 to

prepare a Plan, and instructed the holding company of the

petitioner to obtain necessary approvals from Provincial

Environment Authority, Irrigation, Forest Conservation and

other relevant State Departments.

Whilst these approvals were pending (and some obtained), the

District Forest Officer of Puttalam by letter marked P17 dated

4 Paragraph 10 of the amended petition. 5 Paragraph 10 of the amended petition.

5

07.02.2002 has informed the petitioner not to clear the Reserved

Forest expanding the 25 Acre land.

In the meantime, a larger land in extent of 2193.309 Hectares

including the aforesaid 25 Acres alleged to have been released to

the petitioner to later grant on a Lease, has been declared as

Thabbowa Sanctuary by virtue of an order made by the Minister

of Environment under the Fauna and Flora Protection

Ordinance, published in the Gazette dated 19.07.2002.6

Thereafter the Divisional Secretary of Wanathawilluwa by P22

dated 02.03.2005 has informed the petitioner to vacate the 25

Acre land as the District Land Committee unanimously decided

that it cannot be released to the petitioner (on a long Lease or a

Permit) inter alia because it is rich in fauna and flora, and has a

significant archeological value, and falls within Thabbowa

Sanctuary.

Then the petitioner has requested the Board of Investment to

intervene in this matter and the latter has sought an opinion

from the Attorney General about the matter. P24 is the opinion

of the Attorney General. It is this opinion which has largely led

to this interminable litigation. I will later refer to this opinion.

Upon receipt of this opinion, the Board of Investment, with a

copy of the opinion attached, has, by letter dated 06.10.2005,

written to all the stakeholders including Director Provincial

Environmental Authority, Provincial Land Commissioner,

Director Irrigation Department, Divisional Secretary

Wanathavilluwa, Director Agricultural Department, Director 6 P19.

6

Department of Archeology, District Land Utilization Officer,

Director Department of Wild Life Conservation, Director Natural

Resources of the Ministry of Environment, Conservator General

of Forest to inform that The Hon. Attorney General is in the

opinion that there would be no legal impediment with regard to

agricultural cultivation being permitted on the land in issue, which

has been declared as part of the Thabbowa Sanctuary, in terms

of section 2(2) of the Fauna & Flora Protection Ordinance,

provided the proposed cultivation of the land in issue with the

said sanctuary, is not in contravention of the regulations

contemplated under section 7(1) of the Fauna & Flora Protection

Ordinance. Hence the Board of Investment has notified the

concerned officers to permit the petitioner company to

implement the project without further delay.7

Thereafter the Divisional Secretary of Wanathavilluwa has by

P26 dated 08.11.2006 withdrawn P22 whereby the petitioner

was asked to vacate the land.

In the meantime, an organization by the name of Environmental

Foundation Limited, has filed a writ application No.1044/2006

in the Court of Appeal based on P22 seeking to compel the

relevant public officers to remove the petitioners project from

the said location. The Court of Appeal has issued an interim

order preventing the petitioner from carrying on any project

activities within the Thabbowa Sanctuary and Weerakkodicholi-

7 This letter is found in the documents compendiously marked P25A with the amended petition.

7

Eluwankulama proposed Forest Reserve, and the application to

vacate the said interim order has been refused.8

The petitioner by way of Special Leave to Appeal Application No.

45A/2007 (later SC Appeal No.35/2007), has gone before the

Supreme Court against this order, and the Supreme Court has,

as seen from the proceedings, tried to settle the matter, and

thereafter, given directions to the authorities how to put an end

to the matter. At last, proceedings of the Supreme Court

together with those of the Court of Appeal have been terminated

on 16.03.2009 upon a mutual settlement.9

Thereafter, according to the petitioner, on 22.08.2012, the

Divisional Secretary of Wanathawilluwa handed over to the

petitioner 168 Acres of land10, and the draft Indenture of Lease11

was prepared, but the said Lease has not been formally executed

up to date by His Excellency the President being the authorized

signatory for State Land alienation.12

By looking at P57 filed with the counter affidavit of the

petitioner, it appears to me that, it is unlikely that His

Excellency the President would agree to such long Lease being

granted on the reasons stated therein. In P57, the incumbent

President as the then Minister of Environment has inter alia

stated that the said land earmarked for leasing falls within the

Weerakkodichole Reserved Forest from 28.10.2013.

8 P30. 9 P41. 10 P43. 11 P46. 12 Vide paragraph 55 of the amended petition and paragraph 1.18 of the written submissions of the petitioner.

8

Thereafter, in July 2015, criminal proceedings have been

instituted in the Magistrates Court of Puttalam in Case

Nos.16005/15 and 16006/15 by the Department of Wildlife

Conservation against the employees of the petitioner upon

violation of several provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection

Ordinance.13 The petitioner says that this conduct of the

officials of the Department of Wildlife Conservation is arbitrary

and malicious.

In that backdrop, the petitioner has filed the present application

seeking the following main reliefs:

a) To compel the 3rd-9th respondents by writ of mandamus to

grant a Lease to the petitioner (on the Regulations

promulgated under the State Lands Ordinance or

otherwise) or regularize the petitioners possession, in

respect of 25 Acre State Land shown as Lot 1 in Plan

marked P15A (admittedly falling within the Thabbowa

Sanctuary);

b) To quash by writ of certiorari the criminal proceedings

pending in the Puttalam Magistrates Court referred to

earlier; and

c) To prohibit the 1st and 2nd respondents by writ of

prohibition instituting criminal proceedings against the

employees and owners of the petitioner under the Fauna

and Flora Protection Ordinance.

13 P49 and P50.

9

It must be made clear that the petitioner has filed this

application only in relation to 25 Acre State Land, which,

admittedly, in the Thabbowa Sanctuary; and not in respect of

225 Acre State Land (which was reduced to 168 Acre State

Land), and as seen from P57, now apparently falling within

Weerakkodichole Reserved Forest.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner, as seen from

the written submissions, rests the case of the petitioner on two

main grounds.

The first one is on Legitimate Expectation. The learned

Presidents Counsel submits that, from 1998, the respondent

public officials and government authorities held out and

promised to the petitioner in writing and by conduct that 25

Acre land would be granted to the petitioner by way of a Lease

for the fruit cultivation project, and by the time Thabbowa

Sanctuary was later declared, the petitioner had invested about

Rs. 30 million to develop the land expecting that the land would

be given to the petitioner on a long Lease.

I am unable to accept this argument based on Legitimate

Expectation after the area was declared as a Sanctuary under

the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. According to this

argument, notwithstanding a larger area including the said 25

Acres was declared as a Sanctuary, the petitioner private

company shall be allowed to continue with the project, which is

its business, uninterruptedly, and the Government shall be

forced to regularize its possession by executing an Indenture of

Long-Term Lease. No Court, in my view, in such circumstances,

10

can force the Government or rather the Head of the State to give

the State Land which is in the middle of the Thabbowa

Sanctuary on a long Lease on the ground of Legitimate

Expectation of the petitioner. I unreservedly reject that

argument.

The next argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner is that, in terms of section 7 of the Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance, cultivation is a permitted activity within a

Sanctuary, which has not been restricted by way of Regulations

made by the Minister.14

This argument may be based on the opinion given by the

Attorney General in P24.

Let me make the following general observation before I refer to

the said opinion. When an opinion is sought from the Attorney

General, the opinion given shall be clear and precise. It shall

not be open for various interpretations. An opinion is sought

from the Attorney General when a matter is already open for

various interpretations.

The opinion sought by the Board of Investment from the

Attorney General was whether the utilization of the subject land

for an organic fruit and vegetable cultivation project could be

permitted under the relevant prevailing laws.15

A Senior State Counsel for the Attorney General has given the

following opinion.

14 Paragraphs 1.11, 4.15 of the written submissions of the petitioner. 15 Vide letter of the BOI dated 6.10.2005 found in documents compendiously marked P25A.

11

I have considered the material made available to me and

observe that section 7(1)(c)(ii) of the Fauna & Flora

Protection Ordinance provides that no person shall, except

in accordance with regulations, in any state land within

any sanctuary clear or break up any land for cultivation,

mining or for any other purpose.

In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that there would

be no legal impediment with regard to agricultural

cultivation being permitted on the land in issue, which has

been declared as part of the Thabbowa Sanctuary, in terms

of section 2(2) of the Fauna & Flora Protection Ordinance,

provided the proposed cultivation of the land in issue with

the said sanctuary, is not in contravention of the

regulations contemplated under section 7(1) of the Fauna &

Flora Protection Ordinance.

As I have already stated, upon receipt of this opinion, the Board

of Investment, with a copy of the opinion attached, has informed

all the stakeholders to permit the petitioner company to

implement the project without further delay.

It is regrettable that this opinion of the Attorney General is

either wrong or misleading.

Section 7(1)(c)(ii) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance

reads as follows:

No person shall, except in accordance with regulations, on

any State Land within any Sanctuary, clear or break up

any land for cultivation, mining or for any other purpose.

12

According to this section, in my view, cultivation within a

Sanctuary is prohibited, unless it is done in accordance with the

Regulations made by the Subject Minister. It is common ground

that no Regulations have so far been made by the Minister. If

no Regulations have been made, prohibition continues.

The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner that in terms of section 7(1) of the Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance, cultivation is a permitted activity within a

Sanctuary, which has not been restricted by section 7(2) by way

of Regulations made by the Minister is unacceptable.

I have already quoted section 7(1) to state that cultivation is not

a permitted activity within a Sanctuary (unless it is done in

accordance with Regulations, which are yet to be made).

Section 7(2), introduced by Act No. 22 of 2009, reads as follows:

The Minister may for the purpose of this section, make

regulations restricting the carrying out of any specified

activity or activities in any Sanctuary or in any prescribed

Sanctuary where he deems such restriction is necessary or

essential taking into consideration the prevailing

circumstances.

Section 7(2) cannot be (mis)interpreted to say that cultivation in

a Sanctuary is a specified activity, or permitted activity,

which has not been restricted by way of Regulations, and

therefore, there is no impediment in law for the petitioner to

carry out cultivation within Thabbowa Sanctuary.

13

When the opinion was sought by the Board of Investment from

the Attorney General whether the utilization of the subject land

for an organic fruit and vegetable cultivation project could be

permitted under the relevant prevailing laws the Senior State

Counsel on behalf of the Attorney General, in my view, could

have simply stated No because the question was whether it

was permissible under the prevailing laws. Prevailing Laws

(without Regulations) prohibit cultivation within a Sanctuary.

This interpretation of section 7 seems to have been

acknowledged by the petitioner company itself in paragraph 73

of the amended petition which states that: The petitioner states

that it is unreasonable, irrational and illegal to penalize the

petitioner for the failure on the part of the Minister to perform a

mandatory statutory obligation/duty. The petitioners rights are

adversely affected and prejudiced by the Ministers failure to

make such regulations.

Further, by paragraph (i) of the prayer to the amended petition,

the petitioner prays: Without prejudice to the other reliefs prayed

for in this application, grant and issue an order in the nature of

writ of mandamus, directing the 9th respondent to make

regulations under section 7(2) of the Fauna and Flora Protection

Ordinance, in respect of cultivation activities within sanctuaries or

Thabbowa Sanctuary.

If there is no prohibition as there are no Regulations restricting

cultivation in a Sanctuary, there was no necessity for the

petitioner to say that the petitioner was gravely prejudiced by

the failure on the part of the Minister to make Regulations, and

14

to seek to compel the Minister by mandamus to make

Regulations.

I reject the second argument.

Hence I hold that this Court cannot compel the respondents by

writ of mandamus to convey by way of Long Lease the 25 Acre

State Land admittedly falling within the Thabbowa Sanctuary

shown as Lot 1 in Plan marked P15A to the petitioner.

This Court also cannot in the circumstances stop present and

future criminal proceedingsinitiated and to be

initiatedagainst the petitioner on violation of Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance.

What I have stated so far is adequate to conclude the matter.

Nevertheless, let me now advert to another point which is

relevant to the matter under consideration. That relates to the

Supreme Court proceedings referred to above. It is the

submission of the learned Senior State Counsel for the

respondents that the petitioner agreed before the Supreme Court

to exclude the area of the 25 acre land that falls within the

Thabbowa Sanctuary.

As I have already stated, the petitioner by way of Special Leave

to Appeal went before the Supreme Court to get the interim

order issued by the Court of Appeal vacated. That interim order

basically prevented the petitioner from carrying out any project

activity within the Thabbowa Sanctuary until final determination

of the case.

15

The Supreme Court on 16.03.2009 terminated the proceedings

in the following manner.16

This is an appeal from the order dated 17.7.2006 of the

Court of Appeal granting an interim order restraining the

appellants from and his employees continuing with or

carrying on with any project activities within the Thabbowa

Sanctuary and the Weerakkodicholi, Eluwankulama

proposed Forest Reserve.

This matter was adjourned on several days to enable the

appellants to secure alternative land for the organic

agricultural project being the subject matter of the

application. It is now agreed that the alternative land has

been identified at Eluwankulama which is outside the

Thabbowa Sanctuary. An extent of 225 acres has been

identified and the alienation thereof to the appellant is now

being processed. It is submitted that the appellant has

done an Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) in respect of

the project which has been published. The public objections

are to close on 26.3.2009.

Mr. Senanayake, Director Provincial Environmental

Authority, North Western Province is present in Court and

submits that he has already appointed a Technical

Evaluation Committee to proceed with the matter and the

composition of the Committee is specified in the letter dated

16.3.2009 which is now filed of record.

16 P41.

16

In these circumstances, Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner submits that the petitioner would co-operate with

the Director General of Wild Life in excluding the area that

comes within the Thabbowa Sanctuary. The project of the

Appellant will continue only in the other area.

We consider that this is a suitable arrangement and

terminate these proceedings and proceedings with the

Court of Appeal.

If the petitioner or the Provincial Environmental Authority

require a further order from Court in this matter, a motion

will be filed with notice to the other parties.

It is the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner (who was not the Presidents Counsel appeared in the

Supreme Court Case) that the said proceedings only relate to the

new allocation of 225 Acres and not to the 25 Acre pilot project

already commenced within the Thabbowa Santuary. He submits

that the said proceedings have to be understood in conjunction

with the earlier proceedings.

I find difficult to accept that position. The Court of Appeal

proceedings, according to the petitioner17, were initiated on P22,

by which the petitioner was asked to vacate the 25 Acre land in

Thabbowa Sanctuary. The Supreme Court appeal originated

from the interim order issued by the Court of Appeal. In that

backdrop, it is unthinkable that the Supreme Court disregarded

the main issue in relation to 25 Acre land within the Sanctuary,

and gave directions to the authorities to release an additional 17 Vide paragraph 32 of the amended petition.

17

land of 225 Acres to the petitioner. If I may repeat, what has

been recorded is In these circumstances, Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner submits that the petitioner would co-operate with

the Director General of Wild Life in excluding the area that comes

within the Thabbowa Sanctuary. The project of the Appellant will

continue only in the other area. We consider that this is a suitable

arrangement and terminate these proceedings and proceedings

with the Court of Appeal.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner heavily relies on

the first sentence in the proceedings of the Supreme Court dated

26.11.2007 wherein it is stated that: Presidents Counsel for the

appellant (who was not the same Presidents Counsel who

appears for the petitioner in this application) submits that the

appellant is agreeable not to expand the present pilot project of 25

acres which is admittedly located within the Thabbowa

Sanctuary to say that 25 Acre land within the Thabbowa

Sanctuary is therefore unaffected. It appears to me that the said

undertaking may be referable to P17 whereby there was an

allegation that the petitioner was expanding 25 Acre land into

the Reserve Forest.

Proceedings dated 31.03.2008 reveal that the alternative land

has been identified and a sketch plan has been prepared. It

says that: A representative of the appellant is present in Court

and submits that the sketch plan correctly identifies the land that

is to be developed by the appellant as an alternative to the land

that is in question.

18

In any event, the Supreme Court has not directed the public

officials to give the area of the 25 acre land that falls within the

Thabbowa Sanctuary on a long term Lease to the petitioner or

expressly allowed the petitioner to continue to stay there until

regularization of the process or until alternative land is given.

I cannot accept that the Supreme Court even tacitly gave the

permission to the petitioner to carry out a profit-making

business of cultivation in the Thabbowa Sanctuary, which is

prohibited in law under Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.

Taking all the circumstances into account, I accept the

argument of the learned Senior State Counsel for the

respondents that the petitioner agreed before the Supreme Court

to exclude the area of the 25 acre land that falls within the

Thabbowa Sanctuary.

I must make it clear that, the case is not decided on this last

point. This point was dealt with only to fortify the conclusion

already reached that the petitioner cannot be granted the reliefs

sought for.

For the aforesaid reasons, I refuse to grant reliefs to the

petitioner as prayed for in the prayer to the amended petition.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
