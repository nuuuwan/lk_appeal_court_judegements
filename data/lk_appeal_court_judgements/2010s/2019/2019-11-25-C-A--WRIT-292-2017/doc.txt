When this application was taken up for argument on 10th September 2018, the

learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Senior State

Counsel for the Respondent moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on

the written submissions that would be tendered. This Court was thereafter

informed that an amicable resolution of the underlying dispute was being

pursued but on 21st June 2019, the learned Counsel moved that this Court

proceed to deliver its judgment.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to issue the quit notice annexed

to the petition marked 'G' under Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, as amended/

b) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the Respondent from proceeding with

Magistrate's Court Case No. 33876/17. 2

The issue that arises in this application for the determination of this Court is

twofold - the first is whether the Respondent acted reasonably when he

formed his opinion that the land which is the subject matter of the said quit

notice is State land; the second is whether the Respondent acted ultra vires his

powers when he issued the said quit notice marked 'G'.

Prio.~ to c,Q!lsidering the facts of this applicatinn. it wOllld be useful for this

Court to lay down the legal provisions that are applicable to a determination of

the said issue.

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act (the Act) was introduced in 1979

to provide for an expeditious mode of recovery of State land from persons

who were in unauthorised possession or occupation of such state lands.3 The

purpose of the Act has been discussed in the case of Namunukula Plantations

PLC v. Nimal Punchihewa4, where this Court has held as follows:

"A competent authority can have recourse to the [State Lands (Recavery of

Possession)] Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized possession or

occupation of state land including possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land. Any possession or occupation without 'a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law' is unauthorized possession".

A very strict regime has been put in place by the legislature in order to achieve

the above purpose of the Act. The starting point of the said regime is Section

3(1) of the Act which reads as follows:

"Where a competent authority is of the opinion:

(a) that any land is State land; and

' Ihalapathirana vs Bulankulame, Director-General U.D.A [1988 (1) Sri LR 416 at 420) - "The clear object of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is to secure possession of such land by an expeditious machinery without recourse to an ordinary civil action".

_ (P) . tbJ11...(JnY p"erson is) n unauthorized oassE:ssic;m or 9"cupation of such

land, the competent authority may serve a notice on such person in

possessian ar occupation thereof, or where the competent authority

considers such service impracticable or inexpedient, exhibit such

notice in a conspicuous place in or upon that land requiring such

persan ta vacate such land with his dependants, if any, and to deliver

vacant possession of such land to such competent authority or other

authorized person as may be specified in the notice on or before a

specified date. The date to be specified in such notice shall be a date

not less than thirty days from the date of the issue or the exhibition

of such notice."

Section 18 of the Act defines 'State Land' and 'Unauthorised possession or

occupation' as follows:

" 'State land' means land to which the State is lawfully entitled or which may

be disposed of by the State together with any building standing thereon, and

with all rights, interests and privileges attached or appertaining thereto, ....

'Unauthorized possession or occupation' - except possession or occupation

upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law, and includes possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land."

It would be important to note at this stage that prior to initiating the

procedure laid down in the Act, the Competent Authority must form the

opinion that the relevant land is State land. In other words, the Competent

4

Authority must form the opinion that the State is lawfu,lIv entitled to the land

in respect of which the quit notice is to be issued. l he fact that the Competent

Authority only needs to form an opinion in this regard, and is not required to

carry out an investigation of the title of the person who is to be ejected, or give

such person a hearing, in the event such person is claiming a title adverse to

the State, is very clearly set out in Section 3(lA) of the Act, which reads as

follows:

"no person shall be entitled to any hearing or to make any representation

in respect of a notice under subsection (1)".

In the event the person in possession fails to vacate such land and deliver

vacant possession, the Competent Authority shall be entitled in terms of

Section 5 of the Act to file an application for ejectment in the Magistrate's

Court.

The learned Magistrate is thereafter required to issue summons in terms of

Section 6 of the Act to the person named in the said application to appear and

to show cause as to why he should not be ejected from the land as prayed for

in the application for ejectment.

The scope of the Inquiry that has to be held by the learned Magistrate and the

defences that could be taken up by a person against whom an application has

been filed for ejectment have been set out in Section 9(1) of the Act, which

reads as follows:

5

"At s.uc.h in!!.ujr}!..the person on whom summons under sectiOllji has been

set'ved 'shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the

application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid."

Section 9(2) of the Act, which reads as follows, very clearly circumscribes the

jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court:

"It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of the application

under section 5."

The provisions of Section 9 of the Act have been considered in several

judgments of the Supreme Court and this Court.s In Nirmal Paper Converters

(Pvt) Limited vs Sri Lanka Ports Authoritl it was held as follows:

"the only ground on which the petitioner is entitled to remain on this land

is upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State as laid down

in section 9 (1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. He cannot

contest any of the other matters."(emphasis added)

5 See Herath vs Morgan Engineering (Pvt) Limited ((2013) 1 Sri LR 222; Judgment of Sripavan J (as he then was)]; Muhandiram vs Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estates Development Board (1992 1 Sri LR 110J. ' 1993 1 Sri LR 219.

6

The abovero~ ition h;:j~ been confirmed in Aravindakumar vs_ AI~js and

others

7 w'tiere'Sisira De Abrew, J [with Sripavan, J (as he th"eh was) agreeing]

has held as follows:

"According to the scheme provided in the Act a person who is in

possession or occupation of any state land and has been served with quit

notice under Section 3 of the Act can continue to be in possession or

occupation of the land only upon a valid permit or other written authority

of the State described in Section 9 of the Act."

The Act therefore makes it clear that if in the opinion of the Competent

Authority, the State is lawfully entitled to the land in question, and if a person

is in unauthorised possession or occupation of such land, the Competent

Authority is entitled to issue a quit notice seeking to eject from the said land

the person in illegal occupation thereof, and if the said quit notice is not

complied with, to make an application in terms of Section 5 of the Act to eject

such person.

It is reiterated that the starting pOint for the entire process is the opinion of

the Competent Authority that the land is State land. In view of the strict

regime outlined above, and the fact that any person on whom a quit notice has

been served has limited defences, it is important that the opinion that is

formed by the Competent Authority be based on material that establishes, at

least prima facie, that the State is lawfully entitled to the said land.

Having laid out .! haCl!1pticable legal provisions,. this-. .cou.rt-\Al.ouJJi-hr.iefly~

examine the facts'of this application.

The Petitioner states that the land referred to as Lots 25 and 26 of Final Village

Plan No. 445 annexed to the petition marked 'A' containing an extent of 6A 2R

3.7P was owned by Dr. W.L.P.Dasanayake. The Respondent does not dispute

the said position that the land referred to in 'A' was a private land, and the fact

that it was owned by Dr. Dasanayake.

The Petitioner states that pursuant to a request made by the Government

Agent Badulla District, parts of the said Lots 25 and 26 have been subdivided

into two lots, namely Lot Nos. 2208 and 221 by Supplement Plan No. 2 to FVP

445, which has been annexed to the petition marked '8'. This Court has

examined '!!' which has been signed on behalf of the Surveyor General on 23'd

January 1965, and observes that in terms of the Tenement List annexed

thereto marked '81', the requisition for the survey has been made by the

Government Agent, Badulla District on 13th July 1962, for the purpose of

acquiring the said land for the State.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner is in occupation of a part of the land

depicted in Lot No. 220, containing in extent approximately 40 perches and

that several other families are in occupation of the rest of the land depicted in

Lot Nos. 220 and 221. The Petitioner claims further that he has been in

occupation of the said land for a period of 60 years and that he has cultivated

the said land and used it as an agricultural land. The Petitioner has produced

three receipts by which he had paid the acreage tax for the years 1986, 2011

8 The extent of lot No. 220 is SA 2R 7P.

8

and 4QJ6. T.be. R.esp.oruteJ;ll.b.o.l&'eve.r displ!tes the above claim that.th.e I.a.nd..b.as

been developed and-takes up the position that the quit notice was issued as

the Petitioner had failed to cultivate and/or develop the said land.

This Court observes that even though the Petitioner claims that he is in

exclusive possession of the said land, the Petitioner has not divulged the

circumstances under which he came into possession of the said land nor has

the Petitioner produced any title deeds to prove his ownership to the land,

except to claim that he has acquired prescriptive title to the said land by his

long occupation thereof. This Court must state that the determination of the

aforementioned issue before this Court does not require this Court to consider

the title of the Petitioner and that, in any event, in an application of this nature

it is not the function of this Court to examine the title of the Petitioner.

It was the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that

the land occupied by the Petitioner is private land and that even though the

said land was identified for acquisition by the State in 1962, steps have not

been taken to acquire the said land in terms of the Land Acquisition Act and

therefore the said land remains private land. In support of his position that the

land is private land, the learned President's Counsel relied on the

aforementioned Tenement list relating to Supplement Plan No.2 of FVP No.

445 marked 'Bl', which contains an endorsement under the 'Remarks' column

that the said land is "Claimed by Dr. W.L.G.Dasanayake" and is "to be

acquired." On this basis, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the land that he is occupying is not State land and therefore,

the issuance of the quit notice 'G' is ultra vires the powers conferred on the

Respondent, is illegal as well as unreasonable and irrational. This is the basis on

9

which the Petitione[ j~ s.ee.king._the aforementioned Writs of .Certiorari. aud.,...-

Prohibition.

The position of the Respondent is that the acquisition proceedings that were

initiated in 1962 with the requisition for a survey did continue and that the

said land had been acquired by the State, thus making it land to which the

State is lawfully entitled. The Respondent however has not produced a single

document to establish that the acquisition did in fact take place and has stated

that the official documents are not available with the Respondent.9 The

Respondent has however stated in his Statement of Objections that copies of

all documents are available with the Survey Department and that inquiries

have been made to obtain proof that the acquisition proceedings reached a

finality and that the said land is a State land. However, no documents other

than what was filed with the Statement of Objections have been tendered to

this Court.

The Respondent has submitted that in January 2014, the Petitioner submitted

an application to register as a person entitled to State land. The relevant parts

of the said application, which has been produced by the Respondent marked

'Rl' are re-produced below:

It is the position of the Respondent that the Petitioner, by making the said

application to obtain a permit for the said land, has admitted that the land

occupied by him is State land and that the Petitioner is estopped from denying

that he is in occupation of State land. This Court must state that 'Rl' is not

relevant in determining whether the said land is State land, for the reason that

question (v) of Part II has not been answered.

The circumstances in which the Petitioner signed 'Rl' has been explained by

the Petitioner in his counter affidavit as follows:

11

-.\.1,11 ....... 'WI " I handed over the application marked 'Rl' ... when some of the

Government officers working under (the) Respondent visited the village

and distributed the forms to fill and hand over the same and they

informed me that our prescriptive title is not acceptable even to obtain a

bank loan and misled us that they can convey a better crown title to us.'

The said explanation is in consonance with the fact that no answer has been

offered to question (v) of Part II of 'Rl'.

The Respondent has produced marked 'R2', a list of persons selected to

receive State land, which contains the name of the Petitioner. This document

does not have any evidentiary value as it has been prepared on the assumption

that the said land is State land.

The next document that the Respondent has produced is a field inspection

report relating to the Petitioner which had been prepared in February 2017,

prior to the holding of a Land Kachcheri, marked 'R4'. Item 31 thereof reads as

follows:

"~ ff~ ff@@J<DaS ~eoc,,: 1950 e:>6~ @@~ E>&!S ff~) ~~."

It is the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel that the above three

documents establish that the land that is occupied by the Petitioner is in fact

State land. This Court is of the view that the documents marked 'Rl', 'R2' and

'R4' are insufficient to form a reasonable opinion that the State is lawfully

entitled to the land occupied by the Petitioner, as there is simply no material

12

to show that the land was ever owned or acquired by the State. The said

material only indicates the Petitioner's intention to obtain clear title. Ins

observed that 'R4' is inconsistent with the 1962 acquisition proceedings as it

seems to imply that the Petitioner was in occupation even prior to 1962. This is

simply not material that can be relied on to form a reasonable opinion.

This brings this Court back to the issue that arises for determination - i.e. did

the Respondent act illegally or unreasonably or irrationally when he formed his

opinion that the land which is the subject matter of the said quit notice is State

land. In considering this question, it would be useful to bear in mind the

description given by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister

for the Civil Service to the phrases 'illegality' and irrationality:1o

"By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable."

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred ta as

'Wednesbury unreasanableness,ll. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it."

In Regina v. Hull University Vis'tm Ex f.I'irte Page Lord Browne-Wilkinson. __ _

after considering the aforementiuned passage of Lord Diplock, observed as .

follows:12

" Over the last 40 years, the courts have developed general principles of

judicial review. The fundamental principle [of judicial review] is that the

courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making

bodies are exercised lawfully. In all cases, save possibly one, this

intervention by way of prohibition or certiorari is based on the proposition

that such powers have been conferred on the decision-maker on the

underlying assumption that the powers are to be exercised only within

the jurisdiction conferred, in accordance with fair procedures and, in

a Wednesbury sense reasonably. If the decision-maker exercises his

powers outside the jurisdiction conferred, in a manner which is

procedurally irregular or is Wednesbury unreasonable, he is acting ultra

vires his powers and therefore unlawfully. " (emphasis added)

As observed at the outset, the starting point of the steps that are initiated

under the Act is Section 3(1), which clearly requires the Competent Authority

to form an opinion that the land in respect of which he is going to put in

motion the procedures laid down in the Act, is land to which the State is

lawfully entitled. When one considers the detailed provisions of the Act, which

has been outlined above, and the objective that is sought to be achieved,

which is the expeditious recovery of State land from persons who are in

unauthorised occupation of such State lands, it is the view of this Court that

the Competent Authority is only required to form an opinion that the

12 [1993J AC 682 at page 701.

14

impugned land is land to which the State is l::Iwfully entitled to, and t hat the

possession or occupation is unauthorised.

The strict regime for the expeditious recovery of State land stipulated in the

Act only provides a person served with a quit notice, the limited remedies

under Section 9, and a person against whom an Order of ejectment has been

issued, an opportunity to vindicate his title under Section 12 of the Act. It is the

view of this Court that the legislature could not have intended for the

Competent Authority's opinion, which can have far reaching consequences on

one's proprietary rights, to be baseless. The Competent Authority's opinion

must thus be formed on a rational basis. What constitutes a rational basis must

be ascertained case by case. In the present application, this Court is of the view

that a Surveyor General's Plan confirming that the land acquisition process had

been completed, would amply satisfy the test for rationality.13

This Court wishes to emphasise, for the avoidance of any doubt that the

Competent Authority is not required in terms of the Act to carry out an inquiry

of the title of the person who is in unauthorized possession of such land.

This position has been clearly laid down in Farook v. Gunewardena,

Government Agent, Ampara 14 where it was held as follows:

13 See Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows: 'The court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor General or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate; but maps, plans, or surveys not so signed must be proved to be accurate.'; Section 21 of the Survey Act No. 17 of 2002 provides as follows: "Any cadastral map, plan, or any other plan or map prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Act or any written law, purported to be signed by the Surveyor General or officer acting on his behalf and offered in evidence in any suit shall be received in evidence, and shall be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts stated therein." Similar provision was found in Section 6 of the Land Surveys Ordinance, which has since been repealed by the Survey Act.

_ , --':,'.where the. s.tructure of J.he. entire 4ct is t'l_pxeclucle ,investigations ,and _. '"_

inquiries and where it is expressly provided (a) the only defence that can

be put forward at any stage of the proceedings under this Act can be

based only upon a valid permit or written authority of the State and (b)

special provisions have been made for aggrieved parties to obtain relief, I

am of the opinion that the Act expressly precludes the need for an inquiry

by the competent authority before he forms the opinion that any land is

State land."

The fact that the Competent Authority is not required to carry out an

investigation of the title of the person in unauthorised possession of such land

is fortified by the provisions of Section 12 of the Act, which provides a

mechanism for a person against whom an order for ejectment has been made

to vindicate his title.is In fact, in addition to vindicating title and thereby

regaining possession of the land, in terms of Section 13 of the Act, a person

could also obtain compensation for any damages sustained by being compelled

to deliver up possession.

The principle then is that while no inquiry is needed to form an opinion, there

should be a rational basis to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled

to the land. The rational basis should satisfy the Wednesbury test of

reasonableness, Thus, a Competent Authority would be acting reasonably if he

were acting on the basis of a Surveyor General's plan, even if the occupant is

15 Section 12 reads as follows: "Nothing in this Act contained shall preclude any person who has been ejected from a land under the provisions of this Act or any person claiming to be the owner thereof from instituting an action against the State for the vindication of his title thereto within six months from the date of the order of ejectment." See Jayawardana Mudiyanselage Sumanawathie vs. Hon, Attorney General and others for an analysis of the remedies available to a person against whom an order for ejectment has been issued - per Janak De Silva, J, ICA 994/2000(F); CA Minutes of 5th September 2019]

16

is precluded from, carrying out an inquiry.

What then is the 'reasonable basis' that the Respondent in this application had

to form the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land possessed by

the Petitioner? The Respondent does not dispute the Petitioner's argument

that the land in issue was a private land, The Petitioner does not dispute the

position taken up on behalf of the Respondent that the Government Agent,

Badulla District made a request to the Survey Department to carry out a survey

of the said land in order to acquire the said land for the State. But beyond this,

the Respondent has not produced any material to this Court to establish that

the acquisition proceeded to a conclusion, except to state that such material is

not available.

If so, the only material that was available to the Respondent to enable him to

form an opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the said land was the said

survey plan which only states that the land is to be acquired, which in the view

of this Court, is insufficient to form the basis of the opinion as per Section 3. Is

the application of the Petitioner to regularize his occupation sufficient to form

the basis for such opinion? This Court does not think so, suffice it to state that

the said documents would have served to corroborate any independent

material that the Respondent may have had. It would in fact be dangerous to

permit the Respondent to form an opinion that the land is State land solely on

an admission by the Petitioner, as such an admission does not prove that the

State has lawful entitlement to the land.

17

In ihese..cir.c.umstances, ~a) did the Responrie'lt ac,f w~U1i~s jurisdiction when .'-'- ._.-

he formed the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the said land? (b) is

the opinion of the Respondent that the said land is State land, reasonable and

rationale? (c) is it a decision that a sensible person who had applied his mind to

the question to be decided could have arrived at it? This Court does not think

so.

This Court is of the view that given the far reaching consequences of a quit

notice, and the limited defences that are open to a person once ejectment

proceedings are filed, the basis for the Competent Authority forming his

opinion that the land is State land must be on a reasonable basis as discussed

earlier. This Court wishes to reiterate that merely because a person who is

ejected or against whom an order for ejectment has been made, has a remedy

by way of Section 12 does not absolve the Competent Authority from his

obligation to act reasonably and legally, when forming the all important

opinion in terms of Section 3. Taking into consideration all of the above facts,

this Court is of the view that the Respondent acted outside his powers and

illegally as well as unreasonably, when he issued the said quit notice marked

'G'.

The next question that this Court must consider is, given the scheme of the

Act, can this Court issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to issue the

quit notice. This question is being raised in view of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Divisional Secretary. Kalutara and another vs Kalupahana

Mestrige Jayatissa.16 In that case, the Divisional Secretary of Kalutara filed four

separate actions in the Magistrate's Court of Kalutara against the respondent

eviction of the respondent from the land referred to in the application for

ejectment. The learned Magistrate made orders for ejection as prayed for but

the learned Judge of the High Court set aside the said orders of the learned

Magistrate. Acting in revision, this Court affirmed the order of the High Court

on the basis that the State had failed to produce any documents to prove that

the land in question was either vested in the State or the impugned property

had been acquired by the State.

On an appeal filed by the Hon. Attorney General, the Supreme Court, having

considered the provisions of the Act, held as follows:

" ... the main question that needs to be considered is whether there is a

requirement to establish the title of the State to the land, by the

Competent Authority, in an application made to have an order for

ejectment issued under the provisions of the Act. When one considers the

structure of the Act, all what is required is for the Competent Authority to

form the opinion that the person is in unauthorised possession or

occupation of any State land and the Competent authority can serve

"notice to quit" under the Act. In considering the provisions of the Act, his

Lordship Justice Abdul Cader stated that "where the competent authority

had formed the opinion that any land is State land, even the Magistrate is

not competent to question his opinion. [Farook v. Goonewardena

Government Agent Amparai.l In the said case his Lordship went on to

state that: 'the magistrate cannot call for any evidence from the

Competent authority in support of the application under section 5, which

means the Magistrate cannot call for any evidence from the competent

applicatian is State land. Therefare, the petitianer did nat have an

oppartunity af raising the questian whether the land is a state land ar

private land befare the magistrates,.ll

Thus, it appears the Caurt af Appeal had fallen into. errar when it held that

the Appellant had failed to. prave that the land in questian was either

vested in the State ar acquired by the State."

The Supreme Court thereafter went on to answer the questions of law raised

by the Hon. Attorney General in the following manner:

(a) The Caurt af Appeal erred in law by halding that the Campetent Autharity

is required to. prave that the land was vested in the Gavernment ar

acquired, in terms af Sectian 9 (2) af the State Lands (Recaver af

Passessian) Act.

b) The Caurt af Appeal misdirected itself in holding that the title af the State

is daubtful when the awnership is beyand the scape af a Magisterial

inquiry under the provisians afthe Act.

c) The Caurt af Appeal erred in law in questianing the apinian formed by the

Campetent Autharity, which is beyand the scape af the Act.

The above reasoning of the Supreme Court reflects the correct legal position

for the factual situation where the Competent Authority, having formed an

files an application for ejectment in the Magistrate's Court. In such a situation,

the learned Magistrate cannot question the legality or reasonableness of such

opinion, nor can the learned Magistrate consider the title of the person who is

sought to be ejected. As stated earlier, the scope of the inquiry before the

Magistrate's Court is circumscribed by the provisions of Section 9, so that the

learned Magistrate can only inquire from the respondent, as to whether he has

a valid permit or written authority of the State granted in accordance with any

written law and if so, whether such permit or authority is in force. If the

respondent cannot say 'yes' to both, the learned Magistrate does not have any

choice, and is required to issue the order for ejectment. This is the strict legal

regime put in place by the Act, which has been referred to in Divisional

Secretary, Kalutara and another vs Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa.18

The situation that this Court is faced with in this application is however

different. The jurisdiction of this Court to consider whether the opinion formed

by the Competent Authority is ultra vires, illegal, unreasonable or irrational has

not been circumscribed by the provisions of the Act. This Court is therefore of

the view that when considering the legality and lor the reasonableness of the

opinion of the Competent Authority in the course of an application filed under

Article 140, this Court can ask the Competent Authority to justify the basis on

which the opinion was formed . This Court must state that in doing so, it is not

the function of this Court to consider the title of the State, or for that matter

the title of the person sought to be ejected, to the said land. That is the

function of the District Court under Section 12 of the Act or in an Actio Res

Vindicatio. This Court will only require the Competent Authority to present the

18 Supra.

has acted legally and/or reasonably.

This Court therefore takes the view that when exercising its jurisdiction in

terms of Article 140, it is entitled to consider the reasonableness and the

legality of the basis on which the Competent Authority formed his opinion as

required by Section 3(1) of the Act. This Court has already concluded that the

Respondent acted illegally and unreasonably when he decided to issue the quit

notice marked 'G' and is therefore of the view that such decision is liable to be

quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. Accordingly, this Court issues a Writ of

Certiorari in terms of paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition quashing the

decision to issue the quit notice marked 'G', and a Writ of Prohibition, in terms

of paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition, restraining the Respondent from

proceeding with Magistrate's Court, Welimada Case No. 33876/17.

The Respondent shall not be prohibited from taking steps against the

Petitioner in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act once it

obtains material that is sufficient to form a reasonable opinion that the land

occupied by the Petitioner is State land. This Court makes no order with regard

to costs.
