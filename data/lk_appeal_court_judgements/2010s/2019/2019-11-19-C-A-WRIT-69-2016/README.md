Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner filed this application on 3'd March 2016. By an amended Petition

dated 2nd May 2016, the Petitioner has sought inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order made by the Minister of Finance

annexed to the petition marked 'X2', whereby a surcharge of Rs. 20 was

imposed on a kilogram of B' Onions, in terms of Section lOA of the

Customs Ordinance;

b) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting and/or restraining the Director General

of Customs, the 4th Respondent from implementing and/or enforcing the

Order 'X2" -,

c) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 4th Respondent to release or refund

the amount of money that Sri Lanka Customs has collected during the

period 22nd September 2015 - 8th October 2015, in terms of the Order

'X2'

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court in this application is

whether the Minister of Finance acted ultra vires the powers conferred on him

in terms of Section 10A(1) of the Customs Ordinance when he imposed a

surcharge on B' Onions while an Order made under the Special Commodity

Levy Act No. 48 of 2007 (the SCL Act) subsisted in respect of B' Onions.

3

Section 10 is the principal section in the Customs Ordinance that provides for

the imposition and levying of Customs duties.1 In addition to the duties that

may be collected in terms of Section 10, the Government, from time to time

has imposed other taxes, levies and charges under different laws, on goods

imported into the Country. Thus, depending on the item that has been

imported, an importer becomes liable for the payment of customs duties,

excise duty, Port and Airport levy, Value Added Tax, cess etc. The SCL Act was

introduced in 2007 to simplify the tax structure on imported goods. This is

reflected in the preamble to t he SCL Act which provides that it is an "Act to

provide for the imposition of a composite levy on certain specified commodity

items in lieu of the amount chargeable on such commodity items as a tax, duty,

levy, cess or any other charge in order to overcome the complexities

associated with the application and administration of multiple taxes on such

specified commodity items ... "

Section 2 of the SCL Act reads as follows:

(1) From and after the date of the coming into operation of this Act,

there shall be imposed a levy to be called the "Special Commodity

Levy" on certain commodity items which shall from time to time be

specified by the Minister by Order published in the Gazette.

(2) The period of validity of every such Order and the rate of the Special

Commodity Levy to be imposed in respect of each such specified item,

'Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance: "The several duties of customs. as the same are respectively inserted, described, and set forth in figures in the table of duties (Schedule A) shall be levied and paid upon all goods, wares, and merchandise imported into or exported from Sri Lanka".

4

either on ad valorem or specific basis, shall also be specified in this

Order.

(3) Every Order made under subsection (1) which is valid for a period of

over thirty days, may be amended or varied by adding thereto or

removing therefrom any item or by reversing the rates specified

therein.

(4) No Order made under subsection (3) may be amended or varied until

the expiration of thirty days from the date of the making thereof.

(5) The Special Commodity Levy so imposed shall be a composite levy

and during the period any Order published in terms of subsection (1)

is in force, no other tax, duty, levy or cess or any other charge

imposed in terms of any of the laws specified in the Schedule to this

Act,2 shall be applicable in respect of the commodity items specified

in any such Order."

The Petitioner states t hat an Order in terms of Section 2(1) of the SCL Act was

published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1931/7 dated i h September 2015,

annexed to the petition marked 'X3', whereby a composite levy was imposed

on B' Onions for a period of 6 months from 8th September 2015, subject to the

provisions of Section 2(3) of the Act. According to the Schedule contained in

the said Order 'X3', t he Special Commodity Levy for B' Onions was Rs. 10.00

per kilogram. As per the dates stipulated in 'X3', the composite levy imposed in

2 The Schedule to the Special Commodity Levy Act consists of the following Acts: The Finance Act, No, 11 of 2002 (Part 1); The Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002; The Finance Act, No. 5 of 2005 Part 1); The Customs Ordinance; The Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979; The Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989.

5

te rms of the said Order was meant to be in force until 8th March 2016, unless it

was amended or varied in terms of Section 2(3).

While the Order 'X3' was in force, the 1st Respondent, t he Minister of Finance

had published an Order under Section lOA of the Customs Ordinance, in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 1933/15 dated 22nd September 2015.

Section 10A(1) of t he Customs Ordinance, which was introduced by the

Customs (Amendment ) Act No. 83 of 1988, reads as follows:

"In addition to any duties leviable under this Ordinance, the Minister

may, with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, by Order published in

the Gazette, levy a surcharge on the customs duty payable on such

imported goods as are specified in such Order, at such rates and for such

periods as are specified in such Order, if he deems it expedient in the

interest of the national economy to do so."

The said Order, annexed to the petition marked 'X2' reads as follows:

" By virtue of the powers vested in me under Section l OA of the Customs

Ordinance (Chapter 235) as amended by Act No. 83 of 1988, I, Ravi

Karunanoyake, Finance Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, do by this order

impose in respect of the commodity item specified in Column 1 of the

Schedule hereto a Surcharge in the interest of the national economy, at

the rates specified in the corresponding entries in Column /I of that

Schedule from 22nd September, 2015 till 08th October, 2015."

6

Thus, it is clear that the surcharge imposed by 'X2' under Section lOA(l) of the

Customs Ordinance was made while a composite levy existed for B'Onions, by

virtue of 'X3' made under the SCL Act.

The Petitioner is an importer of commodities including B' Onions, and had

imported and cleared two consignments of B' Onions during the period that

the Order 'X2' was in force - i.e. on 22nd September 2015 and 8th October 2015

- as evidenced by the Customs Declarations annexed to the petition marked

'X8A' and 'X8B'. It is not in dispute that the Petitioner paid the Special

Commodity Levy in terms of 'X3' and the surcharge in terms of 'X2'.

The complaint of t he learned Counsel for the Petitioner to this Court is that the

said Order 'X2' is ultra vires and contrary to the provisions of the SCL Act, for

the following reasons:

a) No other tax can be imposed on any good under the Customs Ordinance

while an Order made under Section 2(1) of the SCL Act subsists;

b) The Order 'X2' was made whilst the Order 'X3' under the SCL Act was still

in force and 'X2' is therefore contrary to the provisions of Section 2(5) of

the SCL Act;

c) The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has not been sought prior to the

making of the Order 'X2', even though Section 10A(1) requires the

Minister to obtain the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers prior to the

making of such Order.

7

Elaborating further, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the

provisions of Section 2(5) of the SCL Act makes it clear that the Special

Commodity Levy must be charged 'in lieu of' any tax, duty, levy or cess or any

other charge imposed by the laws specified in the Schedule to the Act and that

the Director General of Customs is estopped from collecting any other tax,

duty, levy or cess or any other charge imposed by the laws specified in the

Schedule including the Customs Ordinance, while an Order made under

Section 2(1) of the SCL Act is in force. It is therefore the contention of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the Respondents have contravened the

provisions of Section 2(5) which explicitly states that "no other tax, duty, levy

or cess or any other charge imposed in terms 0/ any 0/ the laws specified in

the Schedule to this Act, sholl be applicable in respect of the commodity items

specified in any such Order."

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that the procedure

laid down in Section 10A(2) of the Customs Ordinance to obtain approval of

Parliament for the Order 'X2' has not been followed by the Respondents.

Provisions with regard to the tabling before Parliament an Order made under

Section -lOA(l), and obtaining the approval of Parliament for such Order are

set out in Section 10A(2) of the Customs Ordinance, which reads as follows:

"Every Order made by the Minister under subsection (1) shall come into

force on the date of such Order. Every such Order shall be published in the

Gazette and shall, as soon as may be after its publication in the Gazette be

tabled in Parliament, Parliament may by resolution revoke any Order

8

made by the Minister under this section within sixty days of the

publication of such Order in the Gazette, and in the computation of such

period of sixty days no account shall be taken of any period during which

Parliament stands prorogued or dissolved. Where any such Order is

revoked any sum paid in pursuance of such order shall be refunded."

It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the said

Order 'X2' was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers only on 2

nd December

2015, and was approved by Parliament only on 2ih January 2016. The

Petitioner therefore states that the Order 'X2' has not been published with the

prior approval of the Cabinet of Ministers nor has it been approved by

Parliament within 60 days of its publication and therefore, the Petitioner is

entitled to the refund of the sums of money paid in terms of 'X2', in respect of

the two consignments imported by the Petitioner.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondents

submitted that the 1st Respondent did not act illegally when he imposed a

surcharge in terms of Section 10A(1} while an Order under Section 2(S} existed.

He presented the justificat ion for 'X2' under three grounds.

His first ground is based on the premise that apart from the provisions of

Section 10 which provides for the imposition of Customs duties, the Customs

Ordinance does not provide for the imposition of any other tax, duty, levy, cess

or any ot her charge. He t herefore submitted that a surcharge is not a duty

imposed under the Customs Ordinance but is something that is imposed in

addition to Customs duty, and hence a surcharge does not come within

Section 2(S}.

9

This Court must observe that for the same reason - i.e. the Customs Ordinance

not providing for t he imposition of any other charge other than Customs duty

in terms of Sect ion 10 - the words, 'any other charge' in Section 2(5) of the SCL

Act cannot be a reference to a provisio'l in the Customs Ordinance, and

therefore a surcharge cannot be categorized as a charge. This Court is in

agreement with the said submission and is of the view that a surcharge is

neither a duty nor a charge, and therefore a , :Jrcharge under Section lOA is

not included in the Special Commodity Lev:" and is not prohibited by Section

2(5).

The second ground advanced by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

was that in any event, given its nature and the purpose for which it is enacted,

the surcharge in terms of Section 10A(1) is rot a 'charge' and therefore does

not fall within t he scope of Section 2(5) of the Special Commodity Levy Act and

thus cannot be said to be in violation of Sectioti 2(5).

Elaborating in t his regard, he submitted that the SCL Act has been enacted to

'overcome the complexities associated with the application and administration

of multiple taxes', or in other words, to simplify the collection of revenue by

combining multiple taxes into a composite levy. On the contrary, a surcharge

under Section lOA is effected when the Minister is of the view that it is

expedient in the interest of the national economy to do so. He therefore

submitted that the purpose of 'X2' and the objective it seeks to achieve is

different to that of 'X3', and that the objective sought to be achieved by

Section l OA is outside t he objective sought to be achieved by the imposition of

a composite levy through the SCL Act.

10

In support of his argument that the Order 'X2' has been issued by the Minister

of Finance in the interest of the national economy, the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General drew t he attention of this Court to the memorandum dated

21st September 2015 submitted by the Director General of Trade and

Investment Policy to the 1st Respondent, marked 'Rl', which reads as follows:

The approval of the 1st Respondent to the said recommendation appears on

'Rl' itself, and steps have been taken on the very next date to publish the

Order 'X2', t hereby demonstrating that urgent action was required to avert the

crisis referred to in the said Memorandum.

The 1st Respondent, by way of a Cabinet Memorandum dated 2nd December

2015, marked 'Rl', has apprised the above factual circumstances that

prompted him to publish 'X2', and obtained the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers for the imposition of the said surcharge.3

The material placed by the Respondents clearly establish that 'X2' was

published by the Minister in t he interest of the national economy, and more

specifically for the purpose of enabling the Sri Lankan producers of B'Onions to

have a fair price in the local market. In the absence of this position being

contradicted by the Petitioner, this Court is of the view that the Minister acted

within the powers conferred on him in terms of Section lOA(l) of the Customs

Ordinance and the said order cannot therefore be considered as being ultra

vires the powers conferred on the Minister by Section 10A(1).

3 The Cabinet Memorandum annexed to the Statement of Objections reads as follows: "In accordance with the provisions of the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007, a levy imposed on any commodity could not be amended until a period of 30 days from the date of imposition. In consideration of receiving the harvest of local Big Onions to the market, the special commodity levy of Rs. 10 per Kg imposed on Big Onions was not adequate to safeguard the local growers. Having taken this situation into account, this Gazette Notification No. 1933.15 of 22.09.2015 was issued to levy a surcharge of Rs. 20 per kilogram on B' Onions from 22.09.2015 to 08.10.2015 under the Section 10 of the Customs Ordinance, as a swift action."

12

The final ground relied upon by t he learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

was t hat the necessity to revise the Special Composite Levy either upwards or

downwards may arise at any t ime, and that the Government must be able to

react in order to protect t he national economy. He submitted that according to

Section 2(3) of t he SCL Act, a composite levy imposed on a specified

commodity can only be amended after thirty days. During these thirty days,

the Act does not provide for a mechanism for making any amendments to the

said Composite levy. An exception to this is contained in Section 5 of the Act

which reads as follows:

(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2, the Minister may, where

he is of the opinion that in view of the prevailing economic

considerations that it is expedient so to do, by Order published in the

Gazette waive for a period of time to be specified in such Order, the

Special Commodity Levy chargeable under section 2 in respect of any

specified item.

(2 ) During the period any Order published in terms of subsection (1) is in

force, no other tax, duty, levy or cess or any other charge imposed in

terms of any of the laws specified in the Schedule to this Act, shall be

applicable in respect of the commodity items specified in any such

Order.

It is the contention of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that Section

5 provides for a reduction of the taxes via a waiver of t he Composite levy,

where prevailing ecanomic considerations require such a course of action, but

13

that the SCL Act does not contain a provision to increase the Special

Commodity Levy, if the interest of the national economy requires an increase

in price. He submitted t hat the necessity to include such a provision in the SCL

Act did not arise as Section lOA of the Customs Ordinance already provided

such a mechanism.

This Court is of the view that t he legislature could not have only contemplated

a situation where the interest of the national economy would require a waiver

of t he Composite levy, without contemplating a situation where the interest of

the national economy would require an increase. This Court is therefore in

agreement with the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

that such a situation was intentionally not contemplated by the SCL Act, since a

mechanism to impose a surcharge already existed by virtue of Section lOA of

the Customs Ordinance.

This Court is therefore in agreement with the submission of the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General that the imposition of a surcharge of Rs. 20 per

kilogram of B' Onions in terms of Section lOA while an Order in terms of

Section 2(1) subsists, is not a violation of the provisions of Section 2(5). Any

other interpretation of Section 2(5) would not allow for a pressing issue

affecting t he national economy of the country to be addressed during those

thirty days during which the Composite Levy is in force.

It is common ground t hat the Order 'X2' was tabled in Parliament on 26th

January 2016, as stated in the Order Paper of Parliament, marked 'X7' and that

it was subsequently approved by Parliament on 2th January 2016. This is

borne out by the letter dated 28th January 2016 marked 'R2' issued on behalf

14

of the Secretary General of Parliament. This Court therefore observes that by

the time this application was filed on 3rd March 2016, the Cabinet of Ministers

had granted its approval for 'X2', and 'X2' had been approved by Parliament. It

is in this background that the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General took up

the position that t he Petitioner is guilty of laches in that there is considerable

delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court, and that this application must

be dismissed in limine.

The necessity for this Court to consider the said submission arises in view of

the aforementioned submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that

there have been irregularit ies in the procedure followed by the Respondents.

The Superior Courts of this country have consistently held that a petitioner

seeking a discretionary remedy such as a Writ of Certiorari must do so without

delay, and where a petitioner is guilty of delay, such delay must be explained

to the satisfaction of Court. In other words, unexplained delay acts as a bar in

obtaining relief in discretionary remedies, such as Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus.

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis4 Sharvananda, J (as he then was) set out the

rationale for the above proposition, in the following manner:

"A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be

held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise

of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well accepted principles.

The Court is bound to issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by

4[1982] 1 Sri LR 368; at pages 377 to 379. This case has been followed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation v. Kaluarachchi and others [SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19" June 2019].

15

the order of on inferior tribunol except in cases where he has disentitled

himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like

submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver...... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury

is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that delay

defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a Writ

application dwindle and the Court may reject a Writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay ...... An application for a Writ of Certiorari

should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which

the applicant seeks to have quashed." (emphasis added)

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another5, the Supreme Court,

adverting to the quest ion of long delay, held as follows:

"If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law

both to punish his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus

subveniunt,6 and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing and others7

Bandaranayake J, dealing with a belated application for a Writ of Certiorari

held as follows:

5 [1999J 2 Sri LR 341 at 35l.

6 For the law assists the watchful, (but) not t he slothful.

7 [2003J 2 Sri LR 10 at pages 15 and 16.

16

"It is however to be noted that delay could defeat equity. Although there is

no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limits in filing an

application for judicial review and the case law of this country is indicative

of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding 'a good and valid

reason' for allowing late applications, I am of the view that there should

be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such belated

applications. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic characteristic

of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay in applying for

the remedy".

Sharvananda, J8 in Biso Menike's case went on to consider if an application for

a writ should be dismissed on account of delay where the act complained of is

an illegality, and held as follows:

"When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court

would be loathe to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject

the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very

extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority

concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court

may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows

that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction." (emphasis added)

The following passage from Lindsey Petroleum Co . Vs. Hurd was also referred

to in Bisomenike's case:9

8 Supra; page 379. (1874) L.R., 5 P.C 221 at 239.

17

"Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the

delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which might

affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the

one course or the other, so far as related to the remedy."lo

The above judgments clearly illustrate four important matters, although not

necessarily in a particular order. The first is that an application for a Writ must

be filed without delay. The second is that where there is, on the face of the

application, a delay, such delay must be explained to the satisfaction of Court.

The third is that delay can be ignored, if the act complained of is manifestly

illegal. The fourth is t he nature of the acts that have taken place during the

commission of t he act complained of and the filing of action.

This Court will now consider the relevant dates in this application, in order to

see whether the submission of the Respondents has any merit.

The Order 'X2' was published on 22 nd September 2015 and was in force until

8th October 2015. The Petitioner imported his first consignment of B' Onions

on 22nd September 2015 and the second consignment on 8th October 2015.

Thus, when the Petitioner submitted his Customs Declarations marked 'X8' and

the surcharge in terms of 'X2' was imposed on the said goods on 22nd

September 2015, the Petitioner became aware of the said surcharge. The

Petitioner has not offered any explanation in his petition as to why he did not

immediately chal lenge 'X2'. The Petitioner thereafter, without any complaint,

paid the surcharge for the second consignment on 8th October 2015, as borne

out by 'XBA'. Once again, the Petitioner has not offered any explanation as to

10 Supra; page 378.

18

why he did not think it fit to cha llenge the imposition of t he surcharge at that

time, or soon thereafter.

The delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court becomes even more

significant when one considers t hat during the period 8th October 2015 and 3rd

March 2016, the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers had been obtained,l1 and

the Order has been approved by Parliament,12 thereby validating 'X2'.

The Petitioner has failed to challenge the validity of the said Order 'X2' when it

was operative, or prior to it being approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and

Parliament, and filed this application only on 3rd March 2016. This Court is of

the view that any person who is aggrieved by any decision of a public authority

must invoke the jurisdiction of this Court at his earliest, and in any event,

without inordinate delay. In t his application, the Petitioner has invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court 5 Y, months after 'X2' came into force, 5 months after

he paid in terms of 'X2', and 5 months after the impugned Order ceased to

have effect. The Petitioner has fa iled to offer any explanation for such delay.

This Court is therefore satisfied that there is considerable delay in filing this

application. The Order 'X2' is not manifestly illegal, and has been approved by

the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliament, at least a mont h prior to the filing of

this application. In t he said circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the

submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General t hat the Petitioner is

guilty of laches, and is not entitled to any relief from this Court.

For the sake of completeness however, this Court would like to consider the

two complaints of the Pet itioner that the procedure laid down in Section lOA

has not been complied wit h.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that Section lOA requires the

Minister to obtain t he approval of the Cabinet of Ministers prior to the

publication of the Order. This Court, having examined Section lOA{l}, and

being mindful that t he said Order is made only where the Minister deems it

expedient in the interest of t he national economy, and considering the urgent

situation that prevailed when 'X2' was published, is of the view that the

approva l of the Cabinet of Ministers is not a cond ition precedent to the

publication of an Order under that section. The legislature could not have

intended it to be so, as the whole purpose of Section lOA was to provide a

mechanism to address a matter of national interest. Even if it was, by the time

the Petit ioner invoked t he jurisdiction of this Court, the Cabinet of Ministers

had approved the said Order. Hence, the delay in invoking the jurisdiction of

this Court would in any event have disentitled the Petitioner to any relief.

The next complaint of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that Section

10A(2) requires the approval of Parliament to be obtained within 60 days of its

publication. This Court must state that there is merit in this argument, and that

the Respondents appear to be in breach of this requirement. However, the fact

of the matter is that in t erms of Article 148 of the Constitution13, it is

Parliament that has full control over public finance, and 'X2' has been

approved by Parliament, prior to the filing of this application. While this Court

13 Article 148 reads as fol lows: 'Parliament shall have fu ll control over public fina nce. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law'.

------

has t he power to strike down 'X2' inspite of Parliamentary approval, this Court

is of the view that this is not a fit case where the discretion of this Court should

be exercised in favour of the Petitioner, for two reasons.

The first reason of course is t he delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court.

The second reason is the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General t hat the Petitioner is a commercial importer of commodities and that

no evidence has been placed before this Court that he suffered any loss as a

result of the imposition of the surcharge or that he was prejudiced in any

manner. This Court observes that the Petitioner has not t aken up the position

that the surcharge was not passed over to the consumer nor has he taken up

the position that he has been prejudiced in any manner by the imposition of

the surcharge.

In view of the finding of this Court that 'X2' is not liable to be quashed, the

necessity for this Court to:

(a) consider the Writ of Prohibition sought by the Petitioner does not arise,

suffice it to say that 'X2' ceased to be in force after 8th October 2015, and

therefore, t he question of restraining the Respondents from

implementing 'X2' any fu rther, does not arise;

(b) consider the Writ of Mandamus sought does not arise, suffice it to say

that the only situation in which funds collected by way of a surcharge

imposed by Section lOA of the Customs Ordinance can be refunded is

where the order is revoked by Parliament, whereas in the present

application, the Parliament has approved the Order 'X2'.

21

In t he above circumstances, this Court is of the view that t he Petitioner is not

entitled to the relief prayed for. This Court accordingly dismisses this

application. No order is made with regard to costs.
