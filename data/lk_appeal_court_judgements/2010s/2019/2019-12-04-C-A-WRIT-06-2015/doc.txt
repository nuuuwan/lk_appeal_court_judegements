Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Faisz Musthapa, P.C., with Gamini Senanayake

for the Petitioner.

Suranga Wimalasena, S.S.C., for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 02.12.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Several Petitioners, 40 in number, filed similar applications

seeking to quash by way of writ of certiorari the Notice to Quit

dated 31.12.1992 (P12) served on them under section 3 of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No.7 of 1979, as

amended, requiring them to hand over vacant possession of the

land to the 1st Respondent on or before 01.02.1993.

The learned junior counsel for the Petitioners informed Court

that these applications can be largely divided into two

categoriesthe Petitioners to whom Permits have already been

issued under the Land Development Ordinance, and those to

whom Permits have not been issued, but who have long been in

possession of the land.

Hence, the Court was invited to deliver two Judgments, one in

CA/Writ/11/2015 to be applicable to Permit Holders, and the

Website Copy Website Copy

other in CA/Writ/6/2015 (the present case) to be applicable to

others.1

However, the pleadings and written submissions filed by both

parties are very similar. Hence, this Judgment will be applicable

to all the cases mentioned in the List dated 26.11.2018 filed by

the Attorney at Law of the Petitioner, with a copy to the Attorney

at Law of the Respondents.

There is no dispute that the land in issue is a State Land.

The position of the Petitioner, as stated in the petition dated

15.12.2014 but presented to Court on 12.01.2015, is that in or

around 1972, a land, approximately 300 acres in extent, at

Mahakudugala, Walapane, Nuwara Eliya, was released to

promote apple cultivation. In order to facilitate that purpose, a

society by the name of Apples Growers Co-operative Society was

formed in Nuwara Eliya.

The Petitioner in paragraph 1 of the petition states that:

This society was established to promote apple cultivation

and to distribute plots of lands amongst the members of the

1 Vide the proceedings dated 19.10.2018 in Case No. CA/Writ/11/2015, and the List of Cases filed by the Attorney at Law of the Petitioner with the motion dated 26.11.2018 in Case No. CA/Writ/6/2015. In addition to the cases mentioned in the said List, there are 15 more similar cases yet to be supported, which the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner wished to do, after the delivery of the Judgment in this case. Those cases which are yet to be supported seem to be: CA/Writ/87/2016, CA/Writ/88/2016, CA/Writ/89/2016, CA/Writ/90/2016 (challenging the Gazette P22); and CA/Writ/12/2015, CA/Writ/21/2015, CA/Writ/27/2015, CA/Writ/32/2015, CA/Writ/36/2015, CA/Writ/38/2015, CA/Writ/40/2015, CA/Writ/43/2015, CA/Writ/48/2015, CA/Writ/49/2015 and CA/Writ/302/2016 (challenging the same Quit Notice P12).

said society for this purpose. The Petitioner who was a

member of the Apple Growers Co-operative Society

Mahakudugala was granted the said land which is the

subject matter of this application by the Government by an

informal arrangement pending the issue of a permit to the

Petitioner.

Thereafter, according to the Petitioner, valuation was done by

the Government valuer in order to determine the tax payable,

and the Petitioner paid the relevant taxes and related fees, after

which he was handed over a portion of land in 1974.

The Petitioner in the petition has narrated several Notices of

Quit served under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

and lawsuits instituted in different Courts against different

parties (members of the Apple Growers Society) to whom

possession was allegedly handed over by the State for apple

cultivation. I think this has historical value, but no direct

bearing to the matter in issue.

As I stated at the outset, the Notice to Quit sought to be

quashed in this application and all the other connected

applications is the one dated 31.12.1992 marked P12.

Let me now consider on which grounds the Petitioner and all the

other Petitioners in connected cases seek to quash that Notice to

Quit by certiorari. These grounds, which are common to all the

applications, have been listed by the Petitioner in paragraph 28

of the petition. That paragraph reads as follows:

Website Copy Website Copy

5

The Petitioner states that the said Quit Notice dated

31.12.1992 (P12) referred to in paragraph 13 hereof and

sought to be enforced by the Magistrates Court of

Walapane issued on the Petitioner by the Respondent

purportedly under section 3 of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act is illegal, null and void and of no force or

avail in law in as much as:

a) The Respondent is not the Competent Authority and

as such ultra vires the provisions of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act

b) The said Notice (P12) has been issued totally without

jurisdiction and unsupported by evidence

c) The Petitioner has been in long, peaceful and

uninterrupted possession of the said land for their

private use and enjoyment for over 40 years and

acquired a prescriptive title thereto

d) The said Notice (P12) is in violation of the Petitioners

legitimate expectation that, upon obtaining

permission from the 2nd Respondent to cultivating

apples, he would be able to cultivate on the said land

without any hindrance

e) The said Notice (P12) offends the principles of

proportionality for the reason that large sums of

money had been invested on the said land

f) The Petitioner having expended large sums of money

and having effected improvements, is entitled to

Website Copy Website Copy

6

exercise the right of jus retentionis and therefore

cannot be unlawfully evicted from the premises

g) The purported Notice (P12) has been issued contrary

to the objectives sought to be achieved by the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, and

as such, is ultra vires the provisions of this Act

h) The purported decision to issue the said Notice (P12)

has been occasioned by collateral and extraneous

reasons

i) The purported decision to issue the Notice (P12) is

unreasonable and violative of the Petitioners

fundamental rights guaranteed to them under Article

12(1) of the Constitution

j) It is in violation of legitimate expectation created by

the holding out by the State in SC Appeal 20/2013

that the Petitioners and other occupants would

benefit by the release of said land

k) The said notice is outside the ambit of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 and has

not been issued for the purpose of protecting state

land.

The Respondents have filed objections to this application.

The Petitioner, in the written submission states, The Hon.

Attorney General filed objections on behalf of all the Respondents

Website Copy Website Copy

7

and merely denied the averments of the petition without any

justification.2

Having said so, after the said objections of the Respondents, the

Petitioner has filed extensive counter objections/counter

affidavit running into 78 paragraphs with documents marked

X1-X34, as if it is the original petition.

The Respondents in the written submission have stated that the

Petitioner purposely presented a different case by way of counter

objections, knowing very well that the Respondents will not have

an opportunity to respond, which is against the Rules and

principles of natural justice, and therefore the new positions

taken up by the Petitioner in the counter objections should be

disregarded.3

It is elementary that a plaintiff cannot take up in the trial a

position different from what he took in his plaint. An appellant

cannot in appeal take up a position different from what he took

in the lower Court. Similarly, a Petitioner cannot in a writ

application take up a new position in the counter objections

from what he took in the original petition. The character of the

action cannot be changed in the guise of filing counter

objections.

Let me first sort out the writ applications filed by the Petitioners

who state they have Permits issued under the Land Development

Ordinance.

2 Vide paragraph 3 of the written submission of the Petitioner filed on 19.09.2019 with notice. 3 Vide paragraphs 6-9 of the written submission of the Respondents filed on 05.09.2019 with notice.

If they have valid Permits issued under the Land Development

Ordinance, they do not need to produce them to this Court

seeking to quash the Notice to Quit. They can, nay, they shall, if

they wish, tender them to the Magistrates Court as a defence.

Section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act reads

as follows:

At such inquiry [before the Magistrates Court] the person on

whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not

be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the

application under section 5 except that such person may

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land

upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such

permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid.

Hence, there is no difficulty in dismissing the applications filed

by the alleged Permit Holders on that basis.

The Respondents in the statement of objections have taken up

several objections to the maintainability of this application. Two

such striking objections are delay and suppression, or

misrepresentation of material facts.

Writ is a discretionary remedy. Inordinate and unexplained

delay in a writ application is fatal. In this case, the impugned

Quit Notice is dated 31.12.1992. The application of the

Petitioner by way of petition and affidavit dated 15.12.2014

seeking to quash that Quit Notice was filed in this Court on

Website Copy Website Copy

9

12.01.2015, which is more than 23 years after the impugned

Notice. It is significant to note that there is nothing in the

petition explaining the delay.

In the written submission, the Petitioner has stated that, as

there were four different Quit Notices, the Petitioner cannot be

responsible for the delay.4 This belated explanation given in the

written submission filed in 2019 is plainly unacceptable.

Different Quit Notices have been issued against different parties

by different bodies. According to the written submission of the

Petitioner, out of those four Quit Notices, only one has been

issued prior to the Quit Notice under consideration.5 According

to paragraph 10 of the petition, that Quit Notice has been issued

not by the 1st Respondent, but by the 4th Respondent against

some other party. Although the Petitioner has mentioned the

Magistrates Court case number (32094/82) regarding that Quit

Notice, he does not state what happened to that case. The other

two Quit Notices have been issued several years after the

impugned Quit Notice. There is no necessity to go into detail

about those Quit Notices as they are beside the point.

In my view, this petition shall be dismissed in limine on

unexplained and inordinate delay.

This leads me to consider the next valid objection taken up on

behalf of the Respondents in relation to suppression or

misrepresentation of material facts.

4 Vide paragraph 81 thereof. 5 Vide page 10 of the written submission.

Website Copy Website Copy

10

I do not intend to go into each and every fact the Petitioner has

suppressed and misrepresented.

Although the Petitioner has filed this application as a member of

the Apple Growers Co-operative Society, through which lands

were released for apple cultivation, the Respondents by

tendering the Members List marked R1 has belied it. The

Petitioner has not challenged R1 in the counter objections.

According to the Respondents, that goes to the standing of the

Petitioner in maintaining this application.

More importantly, the Petitioner in the petition has portrayed

that the Respondents have, quite unexpectedly, started serving

Quit Notices to evict them from the land. In reply, the

Respondents with their statement of objections have tendered a

number of documents to say that it was not so.

According to R4 and R5, lands were to be released through the

Apple Growers Society. R5 written by the 4th Respondent to the

Apple Growers Society is dated 17.03.1976. Thereafter,

according to R6 dated 26.12.1978, the Government has decided

to take back the said land from the Apple Growers Society and

hand it over to the Forest Department, to be exact, to the 1st

Respondent. R6 has been sent by the Government Agent of

Nuwara Eliya to the 4th Respondent with a copy to the Apple

Growers Society. Then, R7 dated 22.01.1979 has been sent by

the 4th Respondent to the Secretary of the Apple Growers

Society asking the latter to be present on 01.02.1979 at the land

to handover possession back to the 4th Respondent on behalf of

the Government (for reforestation). As seen from R8 dated

Website Copy Website Copy

11

13.02.1979, the Secretary of the Apple Growers Society has

replied to R7 by letter dated 29.01.1979 and sought further time

to handover portions of land already cultivated, perhaps until

the reaping of the harvest. R9-R14 go to show how different

Government Agencies, including the Presidential Secretariat,6

have intervened to grant further time and to regain possession of

the land since 1979.

The Petitioner in the counter objections has neither referred to

those documents and rejected them as fabrications, nor stated

that he was unaware of those documents, but simply denied the

paragraphs containing those documents so far as they are

inconsistent with the position of the Petitioner.7

The Petitioner who is seeking a discretionary remedy such as

writ cannot be so evasive. He must be truthful to Court and

must come to Court with clean hands. It is clear that the

Petitioner suppressed material facts when he came to Court,

which alone disentitles him to the equitable relief he has sought.

Upon disclosure of the said facts, the Petitioner, in his counter

objections, has tendered several new documents such as X18-

X23. It is not clear whether they were tendered to counter the

Respondents documents or to take up new positions.

This also tends to prove that the Petitioner did not act with

uberrima fides when he first filed the petition in 2015. He has

withheld some material documents. X18-X21 documents were

already in existence when he filed the application. X22, X23 and

6 Vide R10. 7 Vide paragraphs 15 and 16 of the counter objections.

Website Copy Website Copy

12

X27 documents have come into being after the institution of the

action. Another notable factor is X18-X21 documents are the

result of the representations made to the Presidential Secretariat

by a society by the name of Isuru Grama Sanwardhana Society

(not Apple Growers Society).

In the Supreme Court case of Namunukula Plantations Limited v.

Minister of Lands8 it was held:

It is settled law that a person who approaches the Court for

grant of discretionary relief, to which category an

application for certiorari would undoubtedly belong, has to

come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all

the material facts which have any bearing on the

adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other

words, he owes a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides)

to the court to make a full and complete disclosure of all

material facts and refrain from concealing or suppressing

any material fact within his knowledge or which he could

have known by exercising diligence expected of a person of

ordinary prudence.

The Supreme Court9 further held:

If any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a court

of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to

disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to

13

pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not only has the

right but a duty to deny relief to such person.

Let me now consider the arguments advanced on behalf of the

Petitioner in the written submission.

The Petitioner states that the Quit Notice P12 dated 31.12.1992

is invalid as the delegation of power by the Government Agent to

the 1st Respondent to take steps under the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act by R2 ceased to have effect after

13.11.1992 with the enactment of Transfer of Powers (Divisional

Secretaries) Act, No.58 of 1992. Such a clear position was never

taken by the Petitioner in the petition. In any event, that

argument is devoid of merit as, according to section 5 of the said

Act, with the enactment of the Act all such directions issued by

the Government Agents shall be deemed to have been issued by

the Divisional Secretaries.

The grounds stated in sub paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph

28 of the petition that The Respondent [without stating which

Respondent] is not the Competent Authority and as such ultra

vires the provisions of the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act and The said Notice (P12) has been issued totally without

jurisdiction and unsupported by evidence are also devoid of

merit.

In terms of section 18 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, the Competent Authority in relation to any land

means the Government Agent of the district in which the land is

situated, and section 18(k) further states that the Government

Agent also includes any other public officer authorised by the

Website Copy Website Copy

14

Government Agent. After the Transfer of Powers (Divisional

Secretaries) Act, the Government Agent shall be substituted by

the Divisional Secretary.

It appears that when the 1st Respondent files the action, the

Petitioners say the Competent Authority is the 4th Respondent;

when the 4th Respondent files the action, the Petitioners say the

1st Respondent is the Competent Authority.

The 1st Respondent has not issued the Quit Notice P12 on the

basis that the land belongs to the Forest Department, but on the

basis of the delegation of authority by the 4th Respondent to the

1st Respondent.

Court is satisfied that the Quit Notice P12 has been issued by

the Competent Authority.

The Petitioner also states in the written submission that the

land was declared forest land only in 2007 by the Gazette

marked X27 which was tendered with the counter objections.

Such a position was not taken up by the Petitioner in the

petition. The Petitioner cannot tender new documents and take

up new positions in the counter objections preventing the

Respondents from challenging them by way of pleadings. In any

event, that argument is beside the point.

Firstly, whether this is a forest land or not is irrelevant so long

as the Petitioner admits that this is a State Land. This is

admittedly a State Land. Secondly, there is a difference between

forest land and conservation forest,10 in that, X27 Gazette

10 Vide section 3A of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.

Website Copy Website Copy

15

speaks of conservation forest. Thirdly, there is no agreement

that the land in question falls into the Pidurutalagala

Conservation Forest stated in the said Gazette. In my view,

acceptance of X27 Gazette does not help the Petitioner. It makes

the Petitioners case worse.

Another argument of the Petitioner is that the settlement

reached in SC Appeal No.20/2013 marked P21 in a connected

case is binding on the Respondents, and therefore P12 Quit

Notice is invalid. In the first place, that Judgment is against the

Petitioner (although the Petitioner is not a party). Secondly,

there is no settlement in that case. What the Petitioner states as

the binding settlement is the following observation made by the

Supreme Court.

The learned Solicitor General also submits to this Court that

he has already given directions with a view to providing

some administrative relief to those persons similarly effected

by notices that have been issued in terms of the State Lands

Recovery of Possession Law as a matter of accommodation.

There is no enforceable settlement not to proceed with the cases

filed on the Quit Notice marked P12.

If the Petitioner thinks there is, the Petitioner can take

appropriate steps in that case.

The argument that the Quit Notice P12 is invalid as it is in

violation of the legitimate expectation (a) to continue to cultivate

the land without any hindrance11 and (b) created by the said

11 Vide paragraph 28(d) of the petition.

Website Copy Website Copy

16

settlement in the Supreme Court12 has no basis. The lands were

initially released to promote apple cultivation, and that also not

forever.

By looking at documents such as X22-X24, X25 (a)-(g) (which

are Permits and Grants issued under the Land Development

Ordinance), X27 Gazette (which appears to have declared this

area a Conservation Forest), it seems this long-standing issue

has now become complicated.

The Respondents state that the lands are situated over 5000

feet altitude and part of the catchment area of the Randenigala

Reservoir and the illegal occupation and the cultivation of the said

area by unauthorized occupants including the Petitioner by using

hazardous chemicals severely affect the biodiversity of the entire

conservation forest and cause siltation in the Randenigala

reservoir.13

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

Petitioner, but without costs.

As agreed, the parties in the connected cases will abide by this

Judgment.
