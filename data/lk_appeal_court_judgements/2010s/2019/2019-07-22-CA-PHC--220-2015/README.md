The 5th accused-petitio~er-appellant filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order

of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North Western

Province holden in Kurunegala dated 07.12.2015 in Case No. HCR 50/2015 and

.,'-seeking to set aside the judgment of the Learned Magistrate of Galgamuwa dated

09.05.2014 in Case No. 90541.

Facts of the case: .

The 5th accused-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') with

4> eight other accused persons was charged before the Learned Magistrate of

Galgamuwa for committing offences punishable under section 113B, section 102

of the Penal Code to be read with section 6 and section 15B of the Antiquities

Ordinance No. 09 of 1940 as amended by the Act No. 24 of 1998. The 1st, 2nd and

3rd accused pleaded guilty and the remaining accused namely 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th

accused pleaded not guilty and opted for a trial whereas the 9th accused was

absconding. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned Magistrate acquitted all

accused persons for charge one. The Learned Magistrate convicted the 4th accused

,> for 4th charge, 5th accused for 5th charge, 8th accused for 8th charge and the 9th

accused for 02nd charge. The 6th and 7th accused were acquitted from their charges.

Accordingly the appellant was convicted of charge No. 5 and was imposed a term

of 2 years rigorous imprisonment and a fme of Rs. 150,0001 with a default

sentence of 10 months simple imprisonment. (page 889 of the brief)

Page 30f10

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appell~t preferred a revision application to

the Provincial High Court ofKurunegala.

The Learned High Court Judge affinned the order of the Learned Magistrate and

dismissed the revision application since there was an inordinate delay.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The Order of the Learned High Court Judge u~holding the preliminary

objection that the said revision application was filed after a lapse of one year

is contrary to law

2. Dismissing the revision application without considering the exceptional

circumstances is contrary to law

3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the Court has

discretion to consider a revision application on merits even after lapse of

considerable time

4. The Learned High Court Judge has considered facts relating to the full case

even without hearing the full case at the stage of making an order relating to

a preliminary objection.

It is observed that the appellant, 4th and 8th accused filed an appeal against the

order of the Learned Magistrate dated 09.05.2014 in the Provincial High Court of

Kurunegala and due to the inability of maintaining the case, the appellant had

withdrawn his appeal. The appellant had stated his inability to fmd Rs.52, 0001 as

cost of the brief and accordingly has withdrawn the appeal. The other two accused

proceeded with their appeals and were acquitted from their convictions by the

Learned High Court Judge ofKurunegala under case No. HCA 64/2014. Thereafter

the appellant filed an application for revision against the order of the Learned

Page 40f10

Magistrate to the High Court of Kurunegala. l:Iowever a preliminary objection was

raised by the Learned State Counsel for the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent . (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') that the revision application was

prescribed in law since it was filed after more than one year from the date of the

judgment of the Learn~d Magistrate. The Learned High Court Judge upheld the

preliminary objection and dismissed the said application (Page 33 of the brief).

Thereafter the appellant filed an appeal to this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that-..Q1e Learned High Court

Judge failed to consider that the Court has discretion to consider a revision

application on merits even after lapse of considerable time and therefore the said

order is contrary to law. It was submitted that the . superior Courts, in several

instances, held that delay in filing revision applications cannot be accounted for

reasons to dismiss without considering its merits. The Learned Counsel submitted

following two cases to support his contention;

1. Don Chandra Maximus Illangakoon V. Officer-In-Charge of Police

Station, Anuradhapura and the Attorney General [CA (PHC) 28/2009

decided on 21.11.2014]

2. Mallika De Silva V. Gamini De Silva (1999) 1 Sri L.R. 8S

The Learned Counsel for the appellant brought to the attention of this Court that

only evidence led by the prosecution against the 4th accused and the appellant is the

evidence of PW 02. However the 4th accused was acquitted by the Learned High

Court Judge of Kurunegala under case no. HCA 64/2014 stating that the evidence

of the PW 02 was not related to the incident in question. The Learned High Court

Judge, upon evaluating the evidence of PW 02, was of the view that his evidence

cannot be used to prove the essence of section 100 of the Penal Code beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore the Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the

Page 5 of 10

same position should be applicable to the appellant since he was a low ranking

officer than the 4th accused. I observe that this argument raises a serious question . as to whether there had been a prejudice caused to the appellant due to this

application being dismissed without considering merits of the case.

In the case of Don Chandra Maximus Illangakoon (supra) it was'held that,

Moreover, it is trite law that the delay in coming to Court is not the sole

criteria to dismiss a revision application if the petitioner is in a position to

explain the delay. In this instance, the delay is diie--to the failure to file the

appeal at the appropriate stage in the original action. Therefore, it is clear.

that the petitioner has successfully explained the delay in filing the revision

application.

In the case of Leslie Silva V. Perera (2005) 2 Sri L.R 184, it was held that,

''In this respect I would say it is settled law and our Courts time and again

has held that the revisionary jurisdiction of this court is wide enough to be

. exercised to avert any miscarriage of justice irrespective of availability of

alternative remedy or inordinate delay"

In Read V. Samsudin [1 N.L.R 292] it was held as follows:

''It is not the duty of a judge to throw technical difficulties in the way of the

administration of justice, but where he sees that he is prevented from

receiving material or available evidence merely by reason of a technical

objection, he ought to remove the technical objection out of way upon

proper terms as costs and otherwise ... "

In light of above, it is understood that a person should not be deprived of a hearing

solely on a technical ground especially when it appears that there is a prima facie

Page 6ofl0

case to be considered. Since the 4th and 8th aqcused persons who were charged on

identical charges as the appellant were acquitted on a different appeal, I am of the . view that the appellant should have been afforded an opportunity to be heard by

the Learned High Court Judge regardless of the delay in filing the revision

application. Since the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is due. administration of

justice, it shall not be fettered by a single technical objection. In the case of

Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and others (1997) 3 Sri L.R 01 it was held that,

"Judges do not blindly devote themselves to .p!ocedures or ruthlessly

sacrifice litigants to technicalities, although parties on the road to justice

may choose to act recklessly. "

Therefore I am of the view that a judge should not apply rigid procedural rules to

deny justice in ~ oppressive manner.

The Learned SSC for the respondent argued that the Learned High Court Judge in

fact considered the merits of the case and thereafter dismissed the application. I am

unable to agree with that argument. Upon perusal of the order dated 07.12.2015, it

is manifested that the main reason for the High Court Judge to dismiss the

application was inordinate delay on the part of the appellant. At page 11 of the

order, the Learned High Court Judge held as follows;

eJ lf~E> @ 92i@(Q:fQ2:S) (j)C~ 75Jm~E> ~m ~2:S)() E>eo(25) o~ 25):>C'"'zm 9&((

92i@(gj'Q2:S) (j)C~ ~a;f9a) m15() &75J6~,", 25)6. (Page 33 of the brief)

This portion amply demonstrates that the Learned High Court Judge decided to

_ uphold the preliminary objection. Further I am of the view that if the Learned High

Court Judge in fact went into the merits of the case, he would have realized the

evidence of PW 02 was not relevant to the main incident as he found in the case

Page 7 of 10

..

bearing No. HCA 64/2014. Therefore, I am of the view that the appellant's case

should be considered on merits. Since sending this case back to the High Court for

a fresh hearing on merits would consume more time, I wish to consider the merits

at this stage.

The appellant was charged for aiding and abetting the 1 st, 3 rd ,and 9th accused

persons to commit the charge no. 02 namely for excavating an ancient

archeological site. The appellant was serving as a Gramarakshaka Niladhari under

the direction of the 4th accused who was the Officer in charge of Anti Vice Squad

"-. Unit of Police Station, Galgamuwa. The PW Oland PW' 02 testified that on the

date of incident, the appellant was seen at the archeological site along with other

accused persons. The PW 02 further testified that he knew the appellant was

working in the Police. Upon perusal of the evidence led in the Magistrate's Court it

is observed that the evidence of the PW 02 was related to the incidents occurred

after the main incident in question. The Learned Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the appellant

was only a Gramarakshaka Niladhari and not a Police officer and therefore he did

not have powers to arrest a person other than on the power vested under a private

person as per section 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that even though the Learned

High Court Judge in his order dated 07.12.2015 stated that the judgment of the

Learned Magistrate was made within law, the same High Court Judge in the

judgment under case no. HCA 64/2014 stated that the Learned Magistrate erred in

admitting the evidence of PW 06, who was an accomplice, and the evidence of PW

02 to convict some of the accused persons. Accordingly it' was argued that this

Court has sufficient grounds to interfere with the order of the Learned High Court

Judge and the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Page 8 of 10

I peruse the evidence and it is quite impossibl~ to find that the appellant aided and

abetted as per section 100 of the Penal Code. The 4th accused had stated that he

asked the appellant to inquire about an incident of excavation on 17.09.2010 and

the appellant had examined the place of incident. Thereafter he returned to the

Police Station and informed the 4th accused that there was an excavation. Therefore

the 4th appellant with his team left to examine the place of incident and however

unable to proceed since there was a public outrage. It is observed that the evidence

of thePW 02 mainly relevant to these subsequent incidents. The evidence of PW

"-02 was not corroborated sufficiently to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the

appellant was in fact aiding and abetting the 1 S\ 3rd and 9th appellant to commit the

offence in charge No.02. After evaluating the evidence available and considering

the fact that the 4th accused who was a superior officer with a higher responsibility

is already acquitted for the identical charge, I think that it is neither safe nor

justifiable to affirm the conviction of the appellant. I wish to state that the appellant

is not entitled to be acquitted solely because of the acquittal of the 4th and 8th

accused persons but because of the evidence against the appellant is not strong

enough to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case of Jaharlal Das V. State of Orissa [1991 SC 1388], it was held that,

" ... the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete

that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability

the crime was committed by the accused and none else, and it should also be

incapable of explanation on any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the

d " accuse ...

Page 9 of 10

In Sumanasena V. Attorney General (1999),3 Sri L.R 137, it was held that,

"Evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of

I " aw ...

It is observed that an accused should not be convicted unless there is strong

evidence to clearly establish the guilt of such accused. As I have already

mentioned, the Learned Magistrate erred in convicting the appellant without

credible evidence and the Learned High Court Judge"'erred in dismissing the

revision application solely on the delay in filing the application. Accordingly I set

aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 07.12.2015. I further set

aside the conviction dated 09.05.2014 and the sentence imposed on the appellant

by the Learned :tyiagistrate of Galgamuwa dated 27.05.2014.

Accordingly the appeal is allowed.
