The petitioner filed this application for restitutio in integrum

seeking to set aside the Judgment, Interlocutory Decree and

Final Decree entered by the District Judge of Kalutara in

Partition Case No. 7908/P.

The plaintiff-respondent filed the partition action to partition the

land described in the schedule to the plaint between the

plaintiff-respondent and the 1st defendant-respondent. At the

preliminary survey, the petitioner made a claim before the

surveyor. As seen from Journal Entry No.12 of the District

Court case record, notice has been served on the petitioner by

registered post. As the petitioner did not come to Court, as seen

from Journal Entry No. 17, notice has again been served

through Fiscal. As the petitioner still did not respond to notice,

the Court has named the petitioner as the 2nd defendant and

proceeded with the action. After trial Judgment has been

delivered and Interlocutory Decree has been entered.

Before the partition action was filed by the plaintiff-respondent,

his predecessor, the 1st defendant in the partition action, had

filed a Land Case No.5515 against the petitioner regarding the

same land. That case has, as seen from P14, been withdrawn

on account of the entering of the Interlocutory Decree in the

partition case.

Thereafter the petitioner has made an application in the

partition case for intervention. At the inquiry into that

application, as seen from P20, the petitioner, whilst giving

evidence under oath, has withdrawn that application, on the

premise that the petitioner, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant

3

entered into an Agreement to purchase the subject matter of the

partition action.

Thereafter Court has issued a commission to prepare the final

scheme of partition and confirmed the Final Plan before entering

the Final Decree.

It is in that backdrop, the petitioner has come before this Court,

more than one year after the aforesaid withdrawal of the

application for intervention, seeking restoration on the ground

that the partition action was a collusive action between the

plaintiff and the 1st defendant. This allegation, in the above

facts and circumstances, is baseless. If the petitioner thinks

that the plaintiff and the 1st defendant violated the alleged

Agreement, the remedy lies elsewhere.

There is no merit in this application. Hence the same is

dismissed with costs.
