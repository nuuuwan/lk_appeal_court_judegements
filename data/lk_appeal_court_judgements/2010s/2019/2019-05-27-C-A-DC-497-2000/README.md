Defendant-Respondent

Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Kandy dated

11.07.2000.

The pleaded case of the Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) is that there was an agreement between

him and the Defendant-Respondent (Respondent) which required the Respondent to perform

certain acts in relation to the tea estate co-owned by the parties. The Respondent is the sister of

the Appellant. The Appellant claims that due to the failure of the Respondent to act in accordance

with the agreement he suffered damages amounting to Rs. 4,90,000/= which he sought to

recover in this action.

The Respondent denied that there was any such agreement between the parties.

At the trial an admission was recorded that the parties are the co-owners of the land in dispute.

The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action and hence this appeal.

Although the journal entry of 28.06.2000 indicates that the Appellant had tendered the marked

documents to Court the record does not contain any of the documents marked by the Appellant

during the trial. As directed by Court the Registrar inquired from the Registrar, District Court of

Kandy whether documents marked Pi to P7 are available there to which the response was in the

negative. After several attempts the learned counsel for the Appellant informed that their

attempts at obtaining copies of those documents proved futile. The only document available to

Court was the document Pi marked with the plaint which was marked as P3 during the trial.

It is this document P3 that is relied on by the 'Appeliant to establish that there was an agreement

between the parties. However, its contents do not establish any such contract between the

parties. It is instead a document by which the Appellant appointed the Respondent as his agent

to deal with the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority on his behalf. The Appellant testified

that by P3 the Respondent agreed to pay the workers and look after the work of the tea estate

but the contents of P3 do not establish any such obligation on the part of the Respondent. In

these circumstances, the learned Additional District Judge correctly held that the Appellant had

failed to prove the alleged contract between the parties.

In any event, the Appellant has failed to lead evidence of any damages suffered by him due to

the alleged breach by the Respondent. As SOla J. held in Weerakoon v. Hewamallika [(1978-79)

2 SrLL.R. 97 at 109]:

" We might remember here the fact that in Roman-Dutch Law the mere fact of breach

does not entitle the injured party to claim damages in the absence of some actual

loss sustained. The true damnum in contract is compensation for patrimonial loss. In this

respect our law differs from the English law. The measure of damages will consist of the

actual loss the owner has sustained as well as such future loss as may be the necessary

consequence of the breach. The injured party has the right also to claim by way of

damages the reasonable profits which he has lost (damnum emergens et lucrum

cessans). As far as money can do it, the damages awarded will be commensurate to place

the innocent party in the position in which he would have been had the contract been

performed."

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Kandy dated 11.07.2000.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
