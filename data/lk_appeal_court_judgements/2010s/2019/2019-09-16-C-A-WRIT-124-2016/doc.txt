Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners services as the Senior Assistant Bursar of the

Eastern University were terminated after an inter partes formal

inquiry during her probationary period on charges relating to

financial irregularities.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari:

(a) her interdiction by P14

(b) the charge sheets served on her marked P17 and P20

(c) the termination of her services by P24

(d) the decision of the University Services Appeal Board

marked P30

I must straightway say that it is too late in the day to canvass

her interdiction made prior to the formal inquiry. That could at

least have been canvassed in the former writ application, which

has later been withdrawn.1

The charge sheets and the decision to terminate the services are

challenged not on merits but largely, if not solely, on the high

technical ground that they did not emanate from the lawful

authority.

The Petitioner says that the charge sheet signed by the Vice

Chancellor of the University is bad in law as he is not the

disciplinary authority of the Petitioner. According to the

Petitioner, the disciplinary authority of her is the University

1 Vide P27 and P27A.

3

Council (of which the Vice Chancellor is the Chairman2). The

Respondents do not accept that position on the premise that her

appointment as the Senior Assistant Bursar is to the Swami

Vipulananda Institute of Aesthetic Studies, which is a Higher

Educational Institute established under the Universities Act. In

the facts and circumstance of this case, however, there is no

necessity for me to rule on that question as it is in my view not

decisive to arrive at the final decision in this case. Therefore I

assume that the Council of the University is the disciplinary

authority of the Petitioner.

Then the Petitioner says that the termination of her services by

the University Council (which was done mainly upon the

Disciplinary Inquiry Final Report marked 2R2) is bad in law as,

according to the Letter of Appointment marked P1, the

appointing authority is the University Grants Commission and

therefore, in terms of section 14(f) of the Interpretation

Ordinance3, person who has the power to appoint any officer

shall have the power to remove him.

However, this argument is not entitled to succeed because

section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance is applicable when

the legislature has not provided for the ground or mode of

dismissal, which is not the case here. In terms of section

45(2)(xii) of the Universities Act, the Council has that power.

This has also been acknowledged by the University Grants

Commission by 2R7B.

2 Vide section 44(2) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, as amended. 3 No. 21 of 1901, as amended

4

Then the question is whether the decision to terminate the

services of the Petitioner by the Council can be quashed on the

basis that the charge sheet was issued under the hand of the

Vice Chancellor without the proof of prior approval by the

Council.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents vigorously

submits that the application of the Petitioner shall be dismissed

in limine on the basis that the Petitioner, who was undergoing

the probationary period at the time of termination of her services

after a long-drawn out formal inquiry conducted in consonance

with the rules of natural justice, has no right to challenge the

termination on high technical grounds unless the decision is

tainted with mala fides.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in his written submissions

candidly admits that legal position.4 Learned counsel for the

Petitioner says that in public institutions the normal practice is

that no disciplinary inquiries are conducted against the

employees except in case of permanent employees when there are

allegations against them and the aforesaid approach was

followed in the past and our judiciary has accepted and followed

said principle until recently, and cites a number of Judgments

which followed the traditional approach.

For completeness, let me cite some of those Judgments.

4 Vide pages 16-18 of the written submissions of the Petitioner dated 05.03.2019.

In Ceylon Trading Co. Ltd. v. The United Tea Rubber and Local

Produce Workers Union5 it was held that:

The employer must remain the sole judge of whether the

conduct and work of the workman were satisfactory during

the period on probation and if it decided it is not so, it

would be inequitable and unfair in the absence of malice to

foist the view of the Tribunal on that of the Management of

Labour, maintenance of discipline and other allied

questions.

In Ceylon Cement Corporation v. Fernando6 this Court held:

The employer is the sole judge to decide whether the

services of a probationer are satisfactory or not. A

probationer has no right to be confirmed in the post and the

employer is not bound to show good cause where he

terminates the services of a probationer at the end of the

term of probation or even before the expiry of that period.

The Tribunal cannot sit in judgment over the decision of the

employer. It can examine the grounds for termination only

for the purpose of finding out whether the employer had

acted mala fide or with ulterior motives or was actuated by

motives of victimisation. There is no law which requires that

an employee should be forewarned in writing so that he

may adjust himself to the requirements of the service. The

very word probation implies that he is on trial.

5 [1986] II CALR 62 6 [1990] 1 Sri LR 361

6

The same sentiments were echoed in University of Sri Lanka v.

Ginige7:

During the period of probation, the employer has the right to

terminate the services of the employee if he is not satisfied

with the employee's work and conduct. Where the employee

is guilty of misrepresentation of facts, use of unbecoming

language and misconduct, the termination is justified and

bona fide. If the employer has acted mala fide the

probationer has a right to relief.

Thereafter, learned counsel for the Petitioner states as follows:

However, the position taken in State Distilleries Corporation

v. Rupasinghe [1994] 2 Sri LR 395 is not similar to the said

traditional approach that the employer has the sole

authority. As stated below Justice Mark Fernando in the

said State Distilleries Corporation has taken a different

view in respect of the Probationer. An excerpt of the said

judgment is stated below:

The acceptance of the principle that a Labour

Tribunal has jurisdiction to examine whether a

termination is mala fide, necessarily involves the

corollary that the employer must disclose (to the

tribunal) his reasons for termination; and that means

that he should have had some reason for termination.

An employer who refuses to disclose his reasons for

dismissal cannot be in a better position than if he

7 [1993] 1 Sri LR 362

7

had no reason, and must also be regarded as having

acted mala fide or arbitrarily.

What then is the principal difference between

confirmed and probationary employment? In the

former, the burden lies on the employer to justify

termination; and this he must do by reference to

objective standards. In the latter, upon proof that

termination took place during probation the burden is

on the employee to establish unjustifiable

termination, and the employee must establish at least

a prima facie case of mala fides, before the employer

is called upon to adduce evidence as to his reasons

for dismissal; and the employer does not have to

show that the dismissal was, objectively, justified.

It is also submitted that although there is no requirement of

conducting disciplinary inquiries to justify the termination

(of a probationer) the present trend is to permit the

employees to explain their position in respect of any

allegation made against them. This is to satisfy the

principles of the Rules of Natural Justice. It is submitted

that the Natural Justice contains two Rules as stated

below: Audi Alteram Partem (right to fair hearing), Nemo

Judex Causa Sua (rule against bias).

Then it is clear, according to the learned counsel for the

Petitioner himself, there is no requirement of conducting

disciplinary inquiries to justify the termination of a probationer,

and the burden is first on the probationer employee to establish

8

unjustifiable termination wherein he must establish at least a

prima facie case of mala fides before the employer is called upon

to state his reasons for dismissal.

Has the Petitioner in the instant case established mala fides on

the part of the employer in terminating her services during the

period of probation? The answer is unmistakably in the

negative. In fairness to the learned counsel for the Petitioner, I

must say that the learned counsel does not at least in the

written submissions state that the termination was actuated by

mala fide intentions or ulterior motives on the part of the

Respondents. Learned counsels arguments are mainly based

on technical grounds regarding the procedure of the formal

Disciplinary Inquiry, which he himself now admits in the above

quoted written submission, is not an indispensable requirement

for dismissal of a probationer such as the Petitioner in this case.

Notwithstanding the Petitioner did not establish at least a prima

facie case of mala fides on the part of the Respondents, the

Respondents have given satisfactory reasons for the dismissal.

In this regard, inter alia, the Disciplinary Inquiry Report marked

2R2 is of particular importance.

At the formal Disciplinary Inquiry held, as much as nine

witnesses have been called, and the last witness at the request

of the Petitioner. Throughout the inquiry the Petitioner has

willingly participated and even made a statement without taking

the risk of giving evidence (which prevented the employer from

testing the veracity of that statement by cross examination).

This shows lack of mala fides on the part of the employer.

9

With respect, I cannot fully understand the subsequent

argument of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that although

there is no requirement of conducting disciplinary inquiries to

justify the termination (of a probationer) the present trend is to

permit the employees to explain their position in respect of any

allegation made against them. This is to satisfy the principles of

the Rules of Natural Justice, which the learned counsel says:

right to a fair hearing and rule against bias.

Be that as it may, there is no complaint either by the Petitioner

herself or by the learned counsel on behalf of the Petitioner that

there was no fair hearing or the inquiring authority was bias

against her when she was dismissed from the employment.

The high-flown technical objection that there is no documentary

evidence that the University Council approved the charge sheet

before it was signed by the Chairman of the University Counsel,

does not, in my view, violate the audi alteram partem rule, which

means, listen to both sides before a decision is taken. That also

does not violate the rule against bias unless there is evidence to

the contrary.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner has relied on two decisions of

the Supreme Court in support of his argument. They are

Jinasena v. University of Colombo8 and University of Ruhuna v.

Dr. Darshana Wickramasinghe.9 Both these cases, in my view,

are unhelpful and inapplicable to resolve the issue at hand.

8 [2005] 3 Sri LR 9 9 SC Appeal 111/2010 decided on 09.12.2016

10

Let us remind ourselves that the Petitioner in the instant case

was a probationer (in the position of the Senior Assistant

Bursar). In the former case the Appellant was a confirmed

officer in the University. In the latter, the Appellant was a

Lecturer (Probationary) of the Faculty of Medicine of the

University of Ruhuna.

Learned counsel stresses that despite the Appellant being a

probationary, in University of Ruhuna case, this Court quashed

the decision to dismiss the Appellant from service, which was

affirmed by the Supreme Court.

Let me pause for a while to emphasize that a Judgment is only

an authority for what it actually decides and it cannot be applied

universally by only having a superficial look at the conclusion as

facts involved substantially differ from case to case.

In Gunaratne Menike v. Jayatilaka Banda10, G. P. S. de Silva,

C.J. remarked:

The principle laid down in a decision must be read and

understood in the light of the nature of the action, and the

facts and circumstances the Court was dealing with.

In Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne11 Senanayake J. quoted with

approval the following relevant observation of Lord Halsbury in

the House of Lords case of Quinn v. Leathem.12

10 [1995] 1 Sri LR 152 at 157 11 [1997] 1 Sri LR 197 at 203 12 [1901] AC 495 at 506

11

[T]hat every judgment must be read as applicable to the

particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the

generality of the expressions which may be found they are

not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but

governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in

which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a

case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I

entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that

may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of

reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical

code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the

law is not always logical at all.

Coming back to the matter at hand, in University of Ruhuna

case, this Court quashed the dismissal on the sole basis that the

charge sheet issued to the Petitioner in that case was not

approved by the Council, which was the disciplinary authority,

before it was issued by the then Vice Chancellor. Accordingly, this

Court held that all proceedings and decisions arrived at on the

basis of the said charge sheet were a nullity.13

In appeal by the University, this conclusion was affirmed by the

Supreme Court14, and upon further analysis of the facts of the case

stated inter alia that there was real likelihood of bias in the manner

in which disciplinary action was taken by the Council against the

Petitioner-Respondent in that case.

13 Vide the Judgment in CA/WRIT/624/2007 dated on 05.05.2010 marked P29A. 14 SC Appeal 111/2010 decided on 09.12.2016Although there were no annexures with the written submissions of the Petitioner, I read the Judgment.

12

According to section 45(2)(xii) of the Universities Act, it is the

Council of the University which has the authority to appoint

persons to, and to suspend, dismiss or otherwise punish persons

in the employment of, the University. The proviso to that section

states that except in the case of officers and teachers, these

powers may be delegated to the Vice Chancellor.

Section 147 of the Universities Act defines teacher in the

following manner.

Teacher means a Senior Professor, Professor, Associate

Professor, Senior Lecturer Grade I, Senior Lecturer Grade II,

Lecturer and Lecturer (Probationary) and the holder of any

post, declared by Ordinance to be a post, the holder of

which, is a teacher.

That means, not only a Permanent or Confirmed Lecturer, even

a Probationary Lecturer falls into to the category of teacher

under the Universities Act. There is no such concession to an

officer of the University.15

Then it is clear that in University of Ruhuna case, although the

Petitioner was a Lecturer who was undergoing the probationary

period, his charge sheet could not have been issued without the

approval of the University Council.

Further, in the facts and circumstances of that case, it was clear,

as the Supreme Court has held, there was real likelihood of bias in

the manner in which disciplinary action was taken by the Council

15 Vide section 33 of the Universities Act.

13

against the Petitioner-Respondent in that case. There is no such

allegation in the instant case.

In the instant case, there was no malice or personal vendetta

between the University or the Vice Chancellor and the Petitioner.

The University did not have a plan to get rid of the Petitioner and

recruit another. There is not even an allegation of mala fides on the

part of the University or the Inquiring Officer. This inquiry was

initiated or rather triggered by audit queries made by the Auditor

General. The Petitioner was given a full hearing to unfold her side

of the story. At the end of the inquiry she has inter alia been found

guilty for violation of Financial Regulations, Procurement

Guidelines, University Establishment Code, purchasing items at

higher prices than the market value thereby causing loss to the

Institution. The financial irregularities found to have been

committed during the probationary period by the Petitioner do not

justify her being retained in her designated appointment as the

Senior Assistant Bursar.

In State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe16, the Judgment

relied upon by the learned counsel for the Petitioner, Justice

Mark Fernando admitted the following subject to the condition

that the dismissal of the probationer shall not be vitiated by

mala fides.

[T]here are differences between confirmed and probationary

employment, and especially in regard to the termination

thereof. Probation, as the word implies, is a period during

which an employee is tried or tested, and given the

opportunity of proving himself, in relation to his

16 [1994] 2 Sri LR 395 at 400 and 401

14

employment. As observed by Moonemalle, J., in Moosajees

Ltd. v. Rasiah [1986] 1 Sri LR 365, 367, 369:

The period of probation is a period of trial during which the

probationers capacity, conduct or character is tested before

he is admitted to regular employment. For the purpose of

confirmation, the [probationer] must perform his services to

the satisfaction of his employer. The employer, therefore, is

the sole judge to decide whether the services of a

probationer are satisfactory or not.

If the employee is found wanting in respect of his work,

conduct, temperament, compatibility with the organization

and his fellow employees, or any other matter relevant to

his employment, the employer is entitled to dismiss him.

In relation to charges, learned counsel for the Petitioner says that

the Petitioner has been found guilty for unknown charges. What

really has happened is, for clarity, the 4th charge has been divided

into six components in the final analysis, and that has not caused

prejudice to the Petitioner.

I must reiterate that a probationer, unlike a confirmed employee,

cannot cling on high technical grounds to challenge dismissal. The

probationer can only challenge the dismissal on the basis of mala

fides on the part of the employer. Mala fides includes

arbitrariness, ulterior motives, irrelevant considerations and the

like.17 There is nothing of that sort in the present case.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner also states that decision of the

Council to recover from the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 762,100/= as 17 State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe [1994] 2 Sri LR 395 at 402

15

half amount of the loss caused to the University by purchasing

items at higher prices than the market value prevailed at the time

of purchase is unjustifiable as there was no specific charge for that

amount to be surcharged. This assessment of loss, admittedly, has

been done after the conclusion of the formal inquiry and without

any notice to or participation by the Petitioner. The Petitioner did

not get any opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the figure.

The explanation that the loss could not have been included in the

charge sheet, but could only have been assessed after the formal

inquiry is unacceptable. That could have been ascertained, if they

were keen, before the charges were framed. I am of the view that,

on that aspect of the matter, the Petitioner has not been afforded a

fair hearing, and therefore that part of the punishment cannot be

allowed to stand. Hence I quash that part of the punishment to

recover a portion of the loss from the Petitioner. That shall have no

bearing to the decision to dismiss the Petitioner probationer from

service.

Subject to that, the application of the Petitioner is dismissed but

without costs.
