HON. ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The l si and 2nd accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the l SI

and 2nd appellants, respectively) were indicted before the High Court of

Negombo; firstly, on a count of conspiracy to commit the murder of

Waragoda Mudalige Jerad Mervyn Perera on or about 21s1 November 2004,

and secondly, for committing his murder in the same course of transaction

at Wattala.

2

i

They were tried before the High Court without a jury and, at its

conclusion, were convicted on both counts on 22nd June 2015. Both

appellants were sentenced to death accordingly. They have challenged

their conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court by seeking

intervention of this Court through the instant appeal.

In support of his appeal, the 1st appellant relied on the following

grounds of appeal;

a. he was denied of his right to a fair trial due to below stated

reasons:

i. the effect of the order made by the trial Court

remanding witness Jayashantha (PW7) on witness

Pradeep Kumara (PW2) who was called by the

prosecution as the next witness,

n. there was no fair prosecution presented by the State,

iii. there was no fair investigation conducted by the State,

b. the trial Court had erroneously admitted a "confessionary"

statement against the 1st appellant,

c. the trial Court had failed to consider the items of circumstantial

evidence, presented by the prosecution, that were "tainted with

fundamental vice"

d. the trial Court had failed to properly consider the alibi of the 15t

appellant.

3

The 2nd appellant claims that he too was denied of a fair trial since

the trial Court had failed to consider the multiple infirmities in the

evidence presented by the prosecution in support of the two counts it had

levelled against the appellants.

It was thought best to undertake an examination of the items of

circumstantial evidence that had been presented before the trial Court,

albeit briefly, at this stage of the judgment, in order to fully appreciate

their scope and relevance in the correct perspective even before this Court

ventures to consider the several grounds of appeal as raised by the

appellants for their relative merits.

The basic structure of the prosecution case is that the 1st appellant,

an Inspector of Police, who was heading a special unit tasked with special

operations, referred to as Unit - C of Biyagama Police, was named as a

respondent in an application filed by the deceased before the Supreme

Court alleging violation of his fundamental rights. The incident referred to

in the said application has happened during the 1st appellant's tenure at

Wattala Police as its Officer-in-Charge of Crimes Branch. Apparently the

deceased was arrested by the 1st appellant mistakenly and was severely

assaulted during detention before his eventual release from Police custody

upon realisation of the mistake. Consequent to the hearing of the said

application before the Supreme Court, the deceased was awarded

compensation. The 1st appellant too had to make a payment to the

deceased in his personal capacity. The said application also had resulted in

a prosecution against the 1st appellant and several others in the High Court

of Negombo under Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman

and Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act No. 22 of 1994. The efforts

4

initiated by the 1st appellant to have the allegations of torture withdrawn

by the deceased were proved unsuccessful and the trial against him was

about to commence, as indicative by the fact that the deceased was served

summons to appear before the said High Court on 2nd December 2004. The

prosecution claimed this looming threat to the 1st appellant had motivated

him to terminate the life of the deceased and therefore had conspired with

the 2nd appellant, who presumably shot the deceased, acting on the

instructions of the 1st appellant.

The evidence led by the prosecution revealed that, in the morning of

21.11.2004, the deceased was travelling in a public bus. He was followed

by the appellants in a white car with tinted windows. In addition to the

appellants, Amarakoon (PW1) and Pradeep Kumara (PW2) were also in the

car. Amarakoon functioned as one of the private informants of the 1st

appellant and was picked up by the said appellant on his way that

morning. The other passenger of the car, Pradeep Kumara was one of the

police officers who was attached to the special unit in which the 1st

appellant functioned as the OIC. This witness had reported to the unit for

duty that morning. He was ordered by the 1st appellant to join him to

apprehend a person connected to the underworld called "Madhura" . He

was also told that it was a task assigned to their unit. They set off from the

Police Station soon after. They travelled in a car driven by the 1st appellant.

It belonged to the 1 st appellant. It was a locally assembled car and therefore

had no proper registration papers. It bore a false registration number. One

of the number plates used in the car, was recovered subsequent to the

shooting, upon information provided by the 1st appellant. The number

5

plate had been cut into three pieces and was found lying concealed in a

shrub.

After a failed attempt to locate the deceased using Amarakoon as a

scout the 1st appellant had followed a bus realising that the deceased was

travelling in it and at some point when the bus stopped, the 1st appellant

too stopped his vehicle. He then instructed the 2nd appellant and Pradeep

Kumara to board the bus.

The 2nd appellant had boarded the bus in which the deceased

travelled with Pradeep Kumara. They have travelled in the bus for a short

distance. 1st appellant followed the bus in his car with Amarakoon. The bus

had come to an abrupt halt in the middle of the road as gun shots were

heard. As the bus has halted, the 2nd appellant got off from the bus in a

hurry, carrying a hand gun with him and got into the 1st appellant's car

that was waiting behind the bus.

Jasaseelan was the conductor of the bus in which the deceased

travelled at the time of shooting. He had identified the 2nd appellant, who

rushed out of the bus with a gun in his hand immediately after the

cracking noise was heard. In the process, the 2nd appellant had trampled

two female passengers who tried to board the bus. Witness Ajith Shantha

was employed as a tyre mechanic in a tyre repair shop close to the location

where the bus had stopped after the incident. He also saw the 2nd

appellant who emerged from the bus with a gun in hand and running

towards the white car that was halted behind the bus and getting into it.

The car then sped off from the scene along with the 2nd appellant while

Pradeep Kumara was left stranded.

6

The deceased was found bleeding inside the bus and had died two

days later. He was immediately rushed to Ragama Hospital and later

transferred to National Hospital where he succumbed to injuries on

24.11.2004. Before his death, he told IP Abeysekara, who served as the OlC

of Kandana Police Station, when he visited the deceased at the lCU of

Ragama Hospital, that he was shot at by an unknown person owing to the

"Wattala incident".

It is in this backdrop, this Court now ventures to consider the

several contentions advanced by the appellants, in support of their

grounds of appeal.

In support of his contention that the 1st appellant was denied of the

substance of a fair trial, learned President's Counsel submitted that main

prosecution witnesses were "intimidated" by the prosecution by remanding

a witness who had previously given evidence. Thereby, the prosecution

denied them of any opportunity to "speak out the truth" but forced them

to present a version they wanted. It was highlighted that, a remand order

was issued subsequent to the prosecution application to treat some of

those witnesses as "adverse witnesses". They were subjected to cross

examination under Section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance. This course of

action adopted by the prosecution and the consequential orders made by

the trial Court in favour of those applications have cumulatively resulted

in a fear psychosis in the minds of the remaining witnesses, who were

subsequently called by the prosecution in support of its case.

Learned President's Counsel claimed those witnesses would have

had the impression in their minds that if they do not give evidence in line

7

with the prosecution story, they would also be treated as "adverse

witnesses" as the previous witnesses and also be remanded. Learned

President's Counsel therefore submits that they were therefore forced by

the circumstances to suppress their intention to speak the" truth".

He further added that Article 4 and 13 of the Constitution of the

Republic has imposed duties on all organs of the State for the observance

of individual rights that are recognised therein and the Courts are no

exception to this constitutional obligation.

It was highlighted by the learned President's Counsel that after the

witness Jayashantha (PW7) was treated as an "adverse" witness, the

prosecution called witnesses Pradeep Kumara (PW2) as its next witness.

After his evidence, the prosecution had h'eated yet another witness as an

"adverse" witness. Pradeep Kumara was arrested by the Criminal

Investigations Department during its investigations and several

statements were recorded off him. He then made another statement to

Wattala Magistrate, under Section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 of 1979, and thereby presented a different version to the one

taken at the CID, regarding the incident.

It was contended that when the Court had remanded the witness,

who preceded Pradeep Kumara, for giving evidence contrary to what he

stated in the statements to Criminal Investigations Department, it is highly

probable that Pradeep Kumara being the next witness to be called, was

giving evidence under the apprehension that if he did not support the

prosecution story, then he too would be dealt with a similar manner.

Therefore, learned President's Counsel submitted that the witness was not

8

clearly in an environment where he felt he was free to speak the "truth"

whilst in the witness box, a fundamental requirement in any criminal

justice system, but was forced by the circumstances to toe the line the

prosecution had taken. In effect, learned President's Counsel added that he

had no alternative but to come out with the version that is favourable to

the prosecution by which it sought to implicate the two appellants.

Moving to substantiate his claim that there was no fair prosecution,

learned President's Counsel highlighted the approach of the learned

prosecutor had adopted, in leading witnesses. He pointed out that the

prosecution commenced its evidence by leading comparatively an

insignificant witness, instead of calling its "star" witness who speak about

the circumstances under which the death of the deceased had occurred. It

was highlighted that the prosecution had led the evidence of witness

jayaseelan as its first witness and had kept back the most important witness

Pradeep Kumara. He was called to give evidence only after witness

jayashantha, who was treated "adverse" by the prosecution and remanded

on that account.

It was also highlighted that the learned prosecutor had commenced

witness jayashantha's evidence by directly reminding him of the statement

he made under Section 127 before the Magistrate's Court, even before his

evidence, in relation to the introd uctory material, is elicited as normally a

prosecutor would do in any other average prosecution, and thereby

reminding the witness of the dire consequences that might follow, should

he resile from that position.

9

In support of his complaint that there was no fair investigation

conducted by the State, learned President's Counsel referred to the

inconsistency of the evidence of Pradeep Kumara in relation to the time,

date and place of his arrest with the evidence of CID officers on these vital

issues. After his arrest, he was kept in a cell which was "infested with rats"

and with no adequate lighting. It was submitted that the witness was

assaulted and kept in the custody of the investigators in trying conditions,

exceeding the legally permissible period which would have had a negative

impact on the witness's resilience. He also referred to the fact that even

though the CID, during its investigations, made certain recoveries which

included live ammunition, a magazine, a set of handcuffs from the

possession of Pradeep Kumara, but strangely there was no corresponding

legal process was initiated for the said illegal possession. He contended

that this was clearly a concession granted to the witness so that the

investigators could have used it as leverage to compel the witness to

implicate the appellants.

Learned President's Counsel placed heavy reliance on the dicta of

judgments of the Supreme Court and High Court of India, in which those

Courts have made certain observations upon the proper manner of

conducting investigations and the entitlement of an accused to a fair trial.

In his reply, learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that it

was transpired during the trial that, prior to the incident, the 1st appellant

offered to settle some of the debts incurred by prosecution witnesses and

had handed over about Rs. 40,000.00 to a witness for that purpose. In

addition, soon after the incident of shooting he had threatened them with

physical harm if they chose to divulge what they know. The 1st appellant

10

also influenced the prosecution witnesses to maintain a version he had

"fabricated" to cover his tracks.

Learned Additional Solicitor General further added that the reason

to implicate the appellants despite the initial reluctance to do so was due

to the fact that the witnesses were apprehensive with the possible

eventuality that they too would be held responsible for the murder they

did not commit. In the circumstances, he contended that the witnesses

chose to speak the "truth", as they did in Court, not due to any

"inducement" by the CID as the appellants contended but due to

realisation of the predicament they were forced into by the 1st appellant.

This fact is clearly illustrated by the very words expressed by witness

Pradeep Kumara who let his frustration out in vernacular terms. Witness,

referring to the 1st appellant's conduct, had said" q8 g@6~ COolCllQ 15)tfJ,,@tfJ

@Clao 013ogClol t:llz@Cl" and that grievance only prompted him to make a

truthful statement before the learned Magistrate and then repeat it before

the trial Court.

With these submissions of the 1st Appellant in mind, this Court now

proceeds to consider them against the evidence that had been placed

before the trial Court; in order to determine the validity of the said

grounds of appeal.

The trial against the two appellants commenced on 03.08.2006 and

the prosecution had led evidence of Jayaseelan (PW4), Ajith Shantha (PW5),

Amarakoon (PW1) and Jayashantha (PW7) in that order. At that stage the

presiding trial Judge was succeeded by her successor on 23.03.2007. It was

the succeeding trial Judge who presided over the partly heard trial until its

11

conclusion and had delivered the impugned judgment. In between these

two points, there was yet another High Court Judge who presided over the

trial Court during three dates in which this case was called in open Court.

However, no evidence was led and recorded before her.

On 23.03.2007, when the trial resumed before the succeeding trial

Judge, both the appellants have made applications to recall the

prosecution witnesses who have already given evidence before his

predecessor. The prosecutor resisted the application but the learned trial

Judge, with his order on 31.08.2007, decided only to have their evidence re-

recorded before him. The learned High Court Judge also made order that

there would not be a trial de novo.

Then the prosecution recalled Jayaseelan (PW4), Jayashantha (PW7),

Pradeep Kumara (PW2) and Amarakoon (PWl) in that particular order

before the trial Court and thereafter continued with the task of presenting

its case by calling the remaining witnesses who were listed in the back of

the indictment. As evident from this sequence, the "star witness" as

termed by the 1 sl appellant was called by the prosecution only after the

evidence of Jayashantha (PW7). Jayashantha has commenced his evidence

for the 2nd time before the trial Court on 16.11.2007 and after his

examination in chief was over, the 1st appellant had immediately

commenced his cross examination. The 2nd appellant commenced his cross

examination of the witness only on 25.01.2008. Halfway through the cross

examination by the 2nd appellant, the prosecution made an application to

the trial Court to permit them to cross examine the said prosecution

witness as per the provisions contained in sections 154 and 155 of the

12

Evidence Ordinance. The trial Court had allowed the said application by

the prosecution and the witness was cross examined by the prosecution.

At the close of the proceedings of the day, the witness was

remanded by the trial Court upon an application by the prosecution. The

case was called thrice before the next witness was called by the

prosecution. On 15.02.2008, when the case was called for the third date, the

witness Jayashantha, who was remanded by the trial Court at the end of the

proceedings of 25.01.2008, was enlarged on bail. Witness Pradeep Kumara

(PW2) was called by the prosecution only on 16.05.2008, after well over a

period of three and half months since the evidence of the last witness

Jayashantha was led.

Thus, it is observed that the complaint of the 1st appellant that the

witnesses were deprived of an opportunity to speak the "truth" in Court

because they were compelled by the circumstances is applicable only to

witnesses who were arrested and remanded by the CID.

It is clear from the long list of witnesses called by the prosecution,

only witnesses Pradeep Kumara and Amarakoon (PWl) belong to the said

category. Witness Amarakoon was the other person to travel in the car

along with the two appellants and Pradeep Kumara on the day of the

shooting. He is a civilian who acted as a private informant of the 1st

appellant at that point of time.

During his submissions, the 1st appellant had conferred the title,

"star witness of the prosecution", to witness Pradeep kumara. In a way, the

1st appellant's recognition of the witness's importance for the case

presented by the prosecution could not be downplayed. He is the only

13

witness who was with the appellants throughout the sequence of events, in

its entirety which culminated with the shooting of the deceased by mid-

day. He also testified as to what the appellants have discussed about the

events that took place in the morning, and when they met again in the

same evening at Biyagama Village over some drinks. His evidence is

therefore relevant to the prosecution not only to establish criminal liability

to the charge of murder but also to establish the charge of conspiracy to

commit murder.

The 1st appellant's contention that he was deprived of the substance

of a fair trial is fundamentally stems from certain circumstances that might

have had a bearing as to the determination of truthfulness and reliability

of the testimony of these two witnesses before trial Court. His grievance

then could be summarised to read that the attendant circumstances in

relation to their arrests, detention, making statements to the CID, making a

statement to the Magistrate and finally giving evidence before the trial

Court have effectively prevented these witness from telling the "truth"

and were forced to come out with a script already prepared by the CID to

implicate the appellants. He added that the situation was exacerbated with

the remanding of a witness Jayashantha who apparently had shifted

positions during cross-examination.

In Attometj General v Lateef and another (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 225, the

Supreme Court noted that "... a fair trial is aLso not capable of a clear

definition". Nonetheless, it had listed out some of the concepts that are

involved in the said judgment.

14

It is obvious that the trial Court was not the proper forum to address

the issues of illegal arrest, detention under unsatisfactory conditions in

which the witnesses were said to have been held. The witnesses Pradeep

Kumara and Amarakoon have never sought any legal redress over the said

issues. In the circumstances, those considerations are relevant, as far as the

trial Court is concerned, only in determining the truthfulness and

reliability of the testimony of these witnesses. In short, these complaints

boils down essentially to a credibility issue that should be decided by the

trial Court, as in the case of any prosecution.

Now the complaint that the witness was prevented by the

circumstances to tell the truth should be examined in detail.

The "truth" as perceived by the 1st appellant might not necessarily

be the "truth" as perceived by the prosecution or of its witnesses. The trial

Courts, when they undertake to determine any relevant questions of fact,

are expected to consider not only the truthfulness of a version of events as

narrated by witnesses in relation to that particular question of fact, but

also the reliability of that version as well. It must consider the whole of the

evidence, presented to Courts through witnesses and apply the time tested

evaluation techniques in coming to conclusions as to the testimonial

trustworthiness of those witnesses. It must satisfy itself that each of the

witness is telling the truth. It is the duty of the trial Court to ascertain and

discover the truth in its true sense, and not what a party wants it to accept

as "truth" as they perceive it. In Premaratne v Republic of Sri Lanka (1998)

3 Sri L.R. 341, it was emphasised by this Court that" the trial judge should

not play the role of a mere umpire but must take effective action to ascertain and

discover the truth."

15

The complaints of assault, ill h'eatment during detention and

adopting coercive methods, are common to witnesses Jayashantha, Pradeep

Kumara and Amarakoon. Jayashantha and Pradeep Kumara were serving

members of the Police Department at the time of their arrests. Amarakoon

was the only lay person. However, during the trial before the succeeding

trial Judge, witness Jayashantha was treated adverse and therefore the

prosecution indicated that they did not rely on his evidence as part of its

case. Hence, if at all, the effects of those complaints on illegal arrests and

acts of assaults are now only relevant in assessing the evidence of the

witnesses Pradeep Kumara and Amarakoon.

In determining this ground of appeal, this Court must bear in mind

that there was no challenge mounted by the 1st appellant as to the

admissibility of the evidence that had been led through these witnesses.

The questions whether the trial Court erred in the reception of

inadmissible evidence and whether the conviction is bad since it was

founded upon inadmissible evidence, were not argued before this Court

under this ground. The 1st appellant's complaint simply is that under these

circumstances he was denied of a substance of a fair trial.

In assessing whether Pradeep Kumara's evidence before the trial

Court is a truthful account of what took place that day or not, while

keeping in mind the challenges mounted by the 1st appellant on that same

issue, it is relevant to consider the background of the witness, as revealed

through his evidence.

At the time of giving evidence in May 2008, witness Pradeep Kumara

has served in the Police Department for well over 18 years. He had served

16

in crimes branch of some of the stations and was attached to special unit

that had been established due to the high rate of crimes in the Biyagama

area, at the time of the incident. Therefore, it is clear that he was not a

stranger to investigative teclmiques adopted by the Police and also to

criminal justice system in general. It is probable that as an officer attached

to a special unit dealing with crimes, he had knowledge of how and why

certain suspects would make statements to judicial officers. He obviously

had knowledge as to how the system worked and therefore had a distinct

advantage about the institutions involved in the criminal justice system,

when compared with the knowledge of an uninformed villager, whose

interaction with the executive arm of the Government is limited to dealing

with Grama Niladhari or Samurdhi Niyamaka of the area at the most.

He clearly admitted that he had altogether made four statements to

eID and had lied in all of them. He said that he was influenced by the 151

appellant to make these false statements. He claimed that what he stated in

these statements are what he had been asked to state by the 1st appellant.

There were contradictions marked off these statements during the cross

examination by the 1 51 appellant. The witness admitted that when

questioned as to who got into the bus with the 2nd appellant, he did not tell

the truth due to fear and had placed his signature to statements whilst

under mental stress. Then he had made a statement to the Magistrate and

in that statement, however, he claims that he told the "truth".

The witness explained the reason for making such a statement. He

stated that" q8 (;)@o'" (!)(5)oIo>~ 6l.!l\<;@.!l\ @Il<lO oBogClo\ Cl/@Cl." When he was

suggested by the 1 51 appellant that in order to palm off responsibility of the

17

murder to someone else he had lied In Court, the witness denied the

suggestion and added:

" G: Illl clOl.iD OCllU CllClllO 6I0@0. g@OG! CS:>o\CllOl .iDOl CllCl @~ ~OO

Cll@G. 6 .iDOl CllCl o @~ ~oo 9@&"

As the witness claimed, he had apparently decided to disclose what

he termed as the "truth" to the Magistrate who recorded his statement in

Chambers. There were two others along with the witness to make such

statements. Even assuming that the witness was coerced by the CID to tell

the "truth", to the Magistrate, as they perceived it, the witness had the

opportunity to admit that posi tion before the trial Court. In fact, he

courageously admitted before trial Court that he lied only to cm and told

them what the 1st appellant wanted him to tell.

Then the impact of the remanding of the overnight witness on

Pradeep Kumara should be considered by this Court. It was jayashantha

(PW7) who was treated adverse by the prosecution and remanded.

Pradeep Kumara testified thereafter as the next witness for the prosecution.

Both Pradeep Kumara and Jayashantha were serving in the Police

Department at that time. jayashantha had already given evidence before

the trial Court but was recalled upon application of the appellants to give

evidence before the succeeding trial Judge. It was during his cross

examination only he was treated adverse by the prosecution. It is correct to

state that when the order of remand was made by the trial Court, Pradeep

Kumara was present in the well of Court and had been warned thereafter

to appear on the next date. When Pradeep Kumara was called to testify on

the next date of tria\, Jayashantha was already enlarged on bail by the trial

18

Court, and the prosecution had indicated its intention to prosecute him for

perjury.

There is no necessity for this Court to consider whether the

prosecution's application to treat Jayashantha as an adverse witness before

the trial Court is justified in the circumstances or not. The only concern

relevant on this particular event is the presumed psychological impact of

the remand order of Jayashantha made on Pradeep Kumara and Amarakoon

which could have had a bearing on their ability to tell the "truth" in Court.

It could well be that the said order of remand would have made Pradeep

Kumara more cautious in giving evidence since he had taken up a different

stance in Court to the one he took in making statements to CID. Both these

witnesses knew Jayashantha gave evidence once and there was no problem.

When Jayashantha was recalled and cross-examined only the application to

treat him adverse was made by the prosecution. It is also probable that

Pradeep Kumara may have been under the apprehension that he should

repeat the "truth", that he told the Magistrate, to steer clear of trouble. But

the witness was emphatic that he told the "truth" to the Magistrate and

offered a very probable explanation for coming out with the "truth" in his

statement to the Magistrate, thereby changing his stance taken at the CIO

at the behest of the 1st appellant. The several contradictions that were

marked off the several statements witness had made to CID concerns the

falsified factual version given on the instructions of the 1st appellant. The

witness clearly stated that he had lied in all four statements. There is no

significant contradiction that had been marked off his statement to the

Magistrate which had the effect of going to the root of the matter and

thereby" shake the basic version of the witness" per judgment of this Court in

19

Best Footwear (Pvt.) Ltd., and two Others v Aboosally and Others (1997)

2 Sri L.R. 137.

It is observed that at the early stages of the investigations by CID,

Pradeep Kumara was influenced by the 1st appellant to come out with a

version, presumably favourable to the 1st appellant which he wanted the

witness to convey as the "truth". Pradeep Kumara had been arrested,

detained and questioned by CID officers. With his arrest and detention by

the CID, in connection with the murder of the deceased, the witness had

realised that the physical hardships and mental agony that he had to

endure were, not because he did something illegal, but because he

suppressed what really happened that day, being the actual "truth" to

CID, and had instead narrated what the 1st appellant wanted him to

convey. The witness, being a serving police officer, had to languish in a cell

where the criminal suspects were generally kept, and that humiliation

coupled with more realistic threat of being treated as a suspect to a murder

he did not commit had cumulatively forced the witness to ponder over the

predicament he was in. It is upon realisation of this frightening reality, as

he said in evidence, that he had decided to disclose the "truth", which is

more in line with the realistic version of the events that took place on the

day of the shooting, to the Magistrate, whom the witness had looked up to

as a reliable person in authority.

There is a time gap of over three and half month in between the

order of remand and Pradeep Kumara's recording of evidence. He had

ample time to assess the two situations. He could have told Court what the

1st appellant told him before making the statements to CID, as the "truth".

Then he had the other option of coming out with the "truth" he himself

20

r told to the Magistrate after realising that the "truth" of the 1st appellant

had already made his life difficult. He opted for the latter cause of action

for obvious reasons.

It is correct that this witness gave evidence for the first time in the

trial Court since the indictment against the appellants were directly

presented by the Hon. Attorney General, without a preliminary inquiry.

He was to be called during the proceedings before the preceding trial

Judge but she was transferred out before that and the succeeding trial

Judge decided to "recall" the witnesses already given evidence and

thereby delaying his turn to give evidence.

It is obvious, therefore, that the trial Court, which has had the

distinct advantage of observing the demeanour and deportment of Pradeep

Kumara in giving evidence, was satisfied to accept his evidence as credible

and reliable account of the events that led to the death of the deceased in

convicting the appellants, after evaluating his performance as a witness in

the witness box.

It is evident from the judgment that the trial Court had accepted

Pradeep Kumara as a truthful and reliable witness after evaluating his

evidence by applying the tests of probability, consistency and partiality. It

was mindful of the fact that there were minor infirmities in the evidence,

but when his evidence is viewed with the other items of evidence

presented by the prosecution, the trial Court was satisfied that his

evidence was amply supported by them and that factor had dispelled any

uncertainty over these infirm segments.

21

The 1st appellant contention is witness Amarakoon's evidence also

similarly tainted. He invited the attention of this Court to his cross

examination where the witness admitted that he urgently needed to get

himself released from the remand custody to attend to his child's school

admission, in support of the position that the witness had falsely

implicated the 1st appellant to this murder to get himself released from

detention. The 1st appellant relied on the judgment of Attorney General v

Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292, to emphasis that both Amarakoon and Pradeep

Kumara are partial and interested witnesses.

This claim of partiality highlighted by the 1st appellant is evident

from the evidence of Amarakoon. But his partiality seemed tilted not

towards the prosecution but in favour of the 1st appellant. During his cross

examination, the wihless had admitted that about two three months before

this incident he was arrested by Fort Police in connection to a robbery of a

van. It was the 1st appellant who intervened on his behalf to secure his

release. Even then the witness had been an informant of the 1st appellant.

Not only his release, the 1st appellant had also intervened to secure the

release of another person, described by the witness as a friend of the 2nd

appellant, who was also arrested along with him. This close association

continued even after the shooting incident. Before the arrest of the witness

by the cm, he was forewarned by the 1st appellant who visited his house

and conveyed that the witness would be arrested by CID.

It was suggested to this witness by the 1st appellant that his desire to

avoid serving a time in jail and to return to his home made him lie about

the incident. The 2nd appellant suggested that the witness's desire to return

to his child made him implicate the appellant. The witness denied both 22

these suggestions and explained his reasons for taking this particular

stance. The witness said in examination in chief itself that he had nothing

to do with the murder and as such he made a statement to the Magistrate

to prevent any injustice being meted out to himself. He repeated this

position during cross- examination by the 151 appellant and stressed that all

he wanted to tell is the truth. During cross examination of the 2nd

appellant, the witness said

U G: @<lI Oc!liiil~GlClcl ~Ol (l)~Q iiilO ~@~ !!)l. ,,31@l!J Cl)o!!) @Cl)O CD~O) cI

~Cl)OJ @0(9) @c!l S61lOl Cl)O) CDCl(9) CDO!!) rno) o iiilO alOJ!!))

oc!l~o !!)10l rnoJ"'

This consistent stance maintained by witness Amarakoon is indicative

of the truthfulness of his account. His explanation of making a statement to

the Magistrate is acceptable since it is highly probable that the moment he

realised that he too would be accused of murder to which he had no

connection, decided to reveal what he know of the sequence of events

leading up to the point of shooting. The fact that he had realised the

potential threat of Police treating him as a suspect for the murder of the

deceased soon after the act of shooting is indicative from his conduct of

concealing the SIM card given to him by the 1st appellant that morning in a

till of his young son, as a precautionary step. This item was later recovered

by the CID during its investigations and the phone records revealed that it

had been used in the morning of shooting to communicate with the other

phone with which another SIM was fitted in, that had been later found

inside the car used by the 1 51 appellant.

The trial Court, in its undertaking of assessing credibility of this

witness, had considered his evidence in detail and found that except for a

23

few minor discrepancies it had matched substantially with the testimony

of Pradeep Kumara and also with the other items of circumstantial evidence

such as the phone call records and recovery of a SIM. The trial Court had

found this particular witness's narration of events was amply supported

by the evidence of Jayaseelan and Nishantha, who are totally unconnected

persons to any of the parties and therefore could undoubtedly be

considered as impartial and independent witnesses.

The concerns highlighted by the learned President's Counsel that

both these witnesses are in fact "accomplices" and the mandatory caution

with which such evidence should be treated had escaped the attention of

the trial Court, need not be considered at length. The evidence is clear that

both these witnesses were in the car in which the appellants travelled due

to the false claim by the 1st appellant that they were to apprehend a person

called Madhura. Pradeep Kumara had reported to his unit on that morning

and was told by the 1st appellant to join him to apprehend the said

underworld figure while Amarakoon was picked up from roadside on their

way. Amarakoon was given the bodily features of the deceased by the 1st

appellant who maintained they are the features of the underworld figure

they were supposed to arrest that morning.

None of these items of evidence were challenged by the appellants

or offered an alternative narration of the factual position to the one

advanced by these witnesses. There was no suggestion that it was them

who actually shot the deceased. Therefore, it is uncontroverted that both of

them joined the two appellants w1der the mistaken belief that they were to

arrest one Madhura. As far as Pradeep Kumara was concerned this was his

official duty assigned to him by the 1st appellant. Clearly these 24

circumstances does not make any of these witnesses' accomplices, in its

legal sense, to the murder of the deceased as they did not know the

existence of the conspiracy or of the latent intentions of the appellants have

entertained in respect of the deceased. This factor is clearly indicative from

the evidence where both these witnesses have seen a gun in the hand of

the 2nd appellant only after the shooting. It is also significant to note that

there was no suggestion by the appellant put to any of these witnesses that

they knew the fate that awaited the deceased that morning.

In De Silva and Others v Attorney General(2010) 2 Sri L.R. 169, this

Court has, in dealing with the issue of credibility of witnesses held:

"Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. Appeal Court

Judges repeatedly stress the importance of the trial judge's

observations of the demeanour of witnesses in deciding

questions of fact. The acceptance or rejection of evidence of

witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the trial Judge,

since he or she is in the best position to hear and observe

witnesses. [n such a situation the Appellate courts will be

slow to interfere with the findings of the trial Judge unless

such evidence could be shown to be totally inconsistent or

perverse and lacking credibilihJ.

Evidence must be weighed and never counted. In reviewing

the veracity of a witness Appellate Courts employ certain

rules and guidelines as they do not have the benefit of

observing and questioning the witness first-hand."

25

This being the position with regard to the credibility of the witness,

the 151 appellant complaint of denial of a fair investigation, fair prosecution

and a fair trial needed to be considered in the light of the judgment he

cited.

Learned President's Counsel relied on an unreported judgment of

the Gauhati High Court, in Writ Appeal No. 20 of 2010 decided on

28.04.2011 to guide this Court on the principles of fair investigation. The

High Court had, in its judgment stated that" .. . every victim of offence has

the right to demand a fair trial meaning thereby that he or she has the right to

demand that the State discharges its Constitutional obligation to conduct a fair

investigation so that the investigation culminates into fair trial."

Over two decades ago, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in Victor

Ivan v 5 N. Silva, Attorne1J General and another (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 340, had

recognised the right to a fair investigation when it said that "A citizen is

entitled to a proper investigation - one which is fair, competent, timely and

appropriate - of a criminal complaint, whether it be by him or against him."

In another unreported judgment cited by the 1 51 appellant, the

importance of conducting fair investigation and the effects of the failure to

conduct an investigation fairly had been considered by the Supreme Court

of India. This was an instance where the Supreme Court of India had

reviewed a determination by a lower Court on an application filed by

certain accused seeking its intervention for a direction to handover

investigations of an instance of triple murder by a specialised agency,

alleging bias on the part of local police. In the judgment of Babu Bhai v

26

State of Gujarat and Others (Criminal Appeal No. 1599/2010 - decided on

26.08.2010), it was stated by the Court:

" ... If the investigation has not been conducted fairly, we are

of the view that such vitiated investigation cannot give rise

to a valid charge sheet. Such investigation would ultimately

prove to be precursor of miscarriage of criminal justice. In

such a case the Court would simply try to decipher the truth

only on the basis of guess or conjectures as the whole truth

would not come before it. It will be difficult for the Court to

determine how the incident took place wherein three persons

died and so many persons including the complainant and the

accused got injured. Not only the fair trial but fair

investigation is also a part of Constitutional rights

guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of

India. Therefore, investigation must be fair, transparent and

judicious as it is the minimum requirement of rule of law.

Investigating agency cannot be permitted to conduct an

investigation in tainted and biased manner. Where non-

interference of the Court would be ultimately result in

failure ofjustice, the Court must intervene."

It is clear from the text of the said judgment, the emphasis by the

Court is placed on "fair, transparent and judicious" investigation by the

relevant authorities where there is no bias or taint could be attributed to its

manner of conducting investigations. The matter before the Supreme

Court was concerned with an instance where the Police was heavily biased

27

towards a particular ethnic group, where its members had an exchange of

blows with members of a rival community over plying rickshaws which

thereafter ballooned to a mass altercation leaving three persons dead. The

Court affirmed the finding by the lower Court that" ... the investigation has

been one sided. Statements of witnesses belonging to only one community had

been recorded, and the members of the other community had been totally excluded

from recording their statements, indicating bias in favour of one community and

against the other."

The instant appeal reveals no such gross partiality or even a

reasonable basis to infer the investigators have used unlawful methods to

implicate the appellants to the crime they were charged with, whilst

conducting investigations.

In addition to his complaint of unfair investigation, the 1st appellant

also complained of an unfair prosecution on the basis that the prosecution

had withheld important wih1esses until the late stages of the prosecution

by presenting relatively unimportant wi messes at its commencement.

During his submissions on this issue, the 1st appellant did not challenge

the prosecutorial discretion on the order of calling wi messes who are listed

on the back of the indichnent. His grievance thus is limited to the issue of

calling witness Pradeep Kumara after three witnesses whom the 1st

appellant termed as unimportant wimesses.

During the trial before the succeeding judge, the prosecution

commenced its case with wimess Jayaseelan who was followed by

Jayashantha, Pradeep Kumara and Amarakoon. The wife of the deceased was

28

the next lay witness called by the prosecution followed thereafter by a long

line of lay and official wih1esses.

It is correct that the most critical evidence regarding the complicity

of each of the appellants were presented through the witnesses Pradeep

Kumara and Amarakoon. 111ey were the two witnesses who travelled in the

car along with the two appellants and are therefore privy to what the

appellants discussed and have done during that journey.

But similarly the witnesses Jayaseelan and John Ajith Shantha are

equally important witnesses since they were the only lay witnesses who

are total strangers to any of the parties and therefore could be regarded as

a highly impartial witnesses. Jayaseelan was the conductor of the bus in

which the deceased was shot at. He identified the 2nd appellant with a gun

in his hand soon after the shooting. Ajith Shantha was the employee of the

nearby tyre shop who also saw the 2nd appellant with a gun.

Jayashantha, although treated adverse at the latter stage of his

evidence, was the immediate neighbour of the deceased. He had

knowledge of the several failed attempts made by the lSI appellant to reach

a settlement over the prosecution founded upon the complaint by the

deceased. This witness was given Rs. 40,000.00 by the l si appellant for

acting as the go between the two, in the discussions about the settlement.

This was a trial without a jury and it had been noted by this Court in

many a judgment that unlike the jurors, the Judges who preside over trials

have sufficient judicial experience and understanding of the legal

principles that are involved in determining the culpability of the accused

they try. Certainly the prosecution did not attempt to corroborate the

29

testimony of any particular witness in advance by adopting this particular

order of calling witnesses (vide the judgment of King v Silva 30 N.L.R.

193). The case for the prosecution is purely based on several items of

circumstantial evidence and as such, it is unreasonable to impose any

restriction to the way in which the case should have presented or the order

in which each of the witnesses are called.

The other complaint of the 1st appellant that witness fayashantha was

reminded by the learned prosecutor of him making a statement under

Section 127 before the Magistrate at the very commencement of the

examination in chief itself needed consideration at this stage.

Learned President's Counsel commented that it was very

unorthodox to commence leading of a witness's evidence by straightaway

reminding him of the statement he made to the Magistrate and continuing

on that line eliciting the relevant evidence. It was his submissions that the

approach of the prosecutor is indicative of issuing a veiled threat to the

witness, reminding him of the fate of the witness who was treated adverse

in a very subtle way and therefore to be consistent with what he already

said in the Section 127 statement implicating the appellants. This is one

possible interpretation one could attribute to the way in which the learned

prosecutor had commenced examination in chief of this witness.

The witness fayashantha by then had already given evidence once

before the predecessor of the trial Judge who continued with the partly

heard trial. The witness therefore was familiar with the Court atmosphere

and the manner of giving evidence having faced, cross-examination by the

two Counsel who represented the appellants separately before the trial

30

Court. However, this Court need not consider this contention of the 1st

appellant any further since this particular witness was treated adverse and

thereby the prosecution had indicated that it would not rely on his

evidence in support of its case. The trial Court also had not referred to his

evidence in reaching the conclusion it had arrived a ton the culpability of

the appellants. Therefore this aspect has become an irrelevant

consideration at this juncture.

As already noted the contention presented by the 1st appellant

before this Court is unfair investigation, unfair prosecution coupled with

certain other contributory factors that had transpired during trial had

culminated in the denial of his right to a fair trial.

The term fair trial has been broadly defined in Wijepala v Attorney

General (2001) 1 Sri L.R. 46, where the Supreme Court has held that the " ...

right of the Appellant to a fair trial which was his fundamental right under Article

13(3). That Article not only entitles an accused to a right to legal representation at

a trial before a competent Court, bu t also to a fair trial, and that includes anything

and everything necessary for a fair trial." Wi th this judgment, the apex Court

had introduced the concept of "equality in arms" into our criminal justice

system based on jurisprudence that had been developed by the judiciary of

the Republic of South Africa.

In Tillekeratne v Officer in Charge, Pugoda Police Station (1997) 1

Sri L.R. 7, the Supreme Court unhesitantly quashed the conviction on the

footing that the appellant before their Lordships was deprived of a fair

trial for the following reasons:

"(i) the charge sheet contains no particulars of the alleged

offence;

(ii) the record does not show that the appellant was given

any further information or an opportunity of

defending himself;

(iii) even a perusal of the appellant's evidence in case

No.400jL does not enable us to gather the facts

material to the charges."

When the l stappellant's contention of denial of the substance of a

fair trial is viewed against the principles that had been laid down in these

judicial precedents, it becomes clear that there was hardly any material to

hold that in fact there was a denial of fair trial to the appellants. The

reasons for the said conclusion are set out below.

The appellants have taken up a defence of alibi. There was no

accusation that the CID did not investigate that claim or had interfered

with the evidence in support of such a claim by the appellants. The

veracity of this claim of alibi is discussed elsewhere in this judgment in

more detail. Although the 1st appellant complained that the witnesses

Pradeep Kumara and Amarakoon were coerced by the CID to make

statements to the Magistrate, implicating the appellant's complicity to the

murder, with assaults, illegal detention and non-prosecution for obvious

criminal conduct, that was not the position suggested to those witnesses

during their cross examination. Already some of the suggestions and

answers of these witnesses have been reproduced above and are clearly

32

indicative of the positions taken up by the appellants during their trial.

This Court had already noted that these two witnesses have repeatedly

said in evidence that the reason to make statements to the Magistrate was

due to the justifiable apprehension of being accused of a murder they did

not commit. The concerns that had been raised by the 1st appellant under

fair trial had already been addressed to in the process of evaluating

credibility of the important witnesses. The circumstances that were relied

on by the 1st appellant in support of his contention that he was denied of

the substance of a fair trial therefore assumes insignificant position since

there was no impact of these concerns on the validity of the conclusion

reached by the trial Court.

The complaint of the denial of a fair trial, appears to be a cleverly

developed strategy by the learned President's Counsel for the lsi appellant

since it was only advanced during the hearing of the appeal by placing

reliance upon his interpretation of certain factual positions that had

surfaced during trial. The l si appellant had particularly highlighted the

unfair investigation that had been carried out by the CID against them in

order to falsely implicate the appellant for the murder of the deceased.

None of these concerns were put to the Investigating officer IP Chanaka de

Silva during cross examination by the 1st appellant. IP Silva is the best

person to answer the alJegation that the "truth" was altered using coercive

methods on important witnesses to implicate that appellants, against

whom the CID desired to foist this murder, when they made statements

before the Magistrate. Nonetheless this Court had considered them and is

33

of the firm view that there was no justifiable basis to entertain such a

complaint.

The trial Court had adequately dealt with the issue of credibility of

the wih1esses in its judgment and was satisfied that what they related

before trial Court were a truthful and reliable account of the events that led

to the death of the deceased. This determination reached by the trial Court

is a question of fact concerning credibility and is well supported by the

evidence presented before the trial Court and accordingly this Court

concurs with the aforesaid conclusion reached by the Court below.

Thus, it is the opinion of this Court that the ground of appeal based

on the denial of a fair trial is an implausible and it finds no support from

the evidence presented before the trial Court, when viewed in the light of

the above considerations. Therefore, the proposition of the 1st appellant

that the witnesses who implicated the appellants have done so falsely to

ward off imputation of criminal liability on themselves upon the promise

of certain concessions and thereby resulting in denial of a fair trial, ought

to be termed as an unconvincing argument.

The 1st appellant, in support of his 2nd ground of appeal that the trial

Court had erroneously admitted a "confessionary" statement had

submitted that the prosecution had presented evidence through witness

Pradeep Kumara, to the effect that he made a statement which had been

admitted by the trial Court, in violation of the prohibition imposed by the

statutory provisions containing Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

34

It was highlighted by the 1st appellant that the disputed item of

evidence is an utterance attributed to him which states that "tJ (3)z<;!l@Cl .. <lI

~g@Cl OC>JCl"

The 1st appellant added that when that particular utterance was

made, it was made to Pradeep Kumara and at that time he was a serving

police officer. Hence, the 1st appellant contended that he is entitled to the

protection under Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Ordinance as that item

of evidence should have been rejected by the trial Court as an item of

inadmissible evidence, instead it had allowed its reception and

erroneously relied on it in imputing criminal liability.

In order to consider this contention, it is important to consider the

context in which the said utterance was made by the 1st appellant.

Witness Pradeep Kumara said in evidence that after the shooting, the

2nd appellant had got into the vehicle driven by the 1st appellant. They

sped away leaving him stranded in the company of the other passengers

who got out of the bus aiter the shooting incident along with the witness.

He then took a bus to Peliyagoda and upon reaching Kiribathgoda, contacted

the 1st appellant by calling him on his number. The witness was then

instructed by the 1st appellant to come to the Police. In the same evening

the 1st appellant came to pick the witness up from his house and was taken

to Biyagama Village Restaurant. There they were joined by the 2nd

appellant, who consumed liquor with the 1st appellant. The witness

questioned the 1st appellant" @JC>ci<; qO c>@<9." The 1st appellant replied"

"tJ <3lz<;!l@Cl @<lI ~g .. Cl OC>JO. eli> c>o Cl(3)(3)~ ."

35

In effect, according to what the l sI appellant contended that his

utterance to the effect that" 6 G)l~@EJ @el ro~@EJ Otl)Jo ." to witness Pradeep

Kumara, a serving police officer, is clearly a "confession" and therefore the

prohibition imposed by Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Ordinance for

its admission as evidence, should apply automatically.

Section 25(1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

"No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as

against a person accused of any offence."

Plain reading of the said section indicates that the prohibition

imposed by this section applies to "confessionary" statement made to a

"police officer". This prohibition on the admissibility of confessionary

statements which were made to police officers received recognition by

Courts as an absolute prohibition. In Seyadu v The King 53 N.L.R. 251, the

Court of Criminal Appeal reiterated this position as its judgment states:

"In The King v. Kiriwasthu (1930) 40 N. L. R. 289, a

Divisional Bench of the Supreme Court, dealing with a

precisely similar objection, upheld the submission that, in the

present state of the law of this country, the prohibition

contained in Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance is

absolute. The unanimous opinion of the Court was that" a

confession made to a Police Officer is inadmissible as proof

against the person making it whether as substantive evidence

or in order to show that he has contradicted himself"

In order to qualify for the absolute prohibition imposed by Section

25, the disputed statement attributed to an accused must first satisfy the

36

criterion of a "confession" as laid down by the relevant judicial

precedents. It is therefore necessary to examine whether the said utterance

of the 1 sl appellant that" 6 C3l1~@E) ,",@m ~g@E) ~CllJO." is in fact qualifies to be

treated as a confession or merely as an admission.

The question whether, an "admission made by the appellant should

have been excluded on the general ground of exclusion" if it leads to an

inference of admission of guilt, was considered by the Court of Criminal

Appeal in R v Anandagoda 62 NLR 241, in the light of the provisions

contained in Section 17(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. Having considered a

long line of authorities, on this point the Court held:

"Subsection (1) defines an admission as a statement

suggesting any inference (i) as to any fact in issue or (ii) as

to any relevant fact. The illustrations to section 5 show that

on a charge of murder the facts in issue are only whether the

person charged did a particular act, whether that act caused

the death, and whether that act was done with a murderous

intention. Hence it is reasonable to assume that the first kind

of statement referred to in subsection (1) of section 17 is an

admission of one of these facts, and of no other. When

subsection (2) is then examined, it becomes clear that the law

declares to be a confession, only that kind of statement which

is an admission of one of the self-same facts or an admission

suggesting the inference that one of the self-same facts is

correct An admission by an accused of facts which can

establish motive, or opportunity or knowledge of a death,

does not suggest an inference that offence was committed -by

37

him; the inference which such a- fact suggests is only that he

may have had a reason or an opportunity for, or knowledge

as to the commission of, the offence. They are only relevant

facts and are not facts in issue, and (to use the language of

the judgments in The King. v.Fernando (1939) 41 N. L. R.

151, and Seyadu (1951) 53 N. L. R. 251., are not facts the

intrinsic terms of I which are such as to be capable of

establishing a prima facie case. If then each of the admissions

of the appellant, considered by itself, was relevant and

admissible, all taken together were equally admissible."

Applying this principle of law, as enunciated by the Court of

Criminal Appeal, to the words" tJ GJl~@CJ @G\ IDfl@CJ ~tl))O", it is obvious

that the said utterance of the lsi appellant had none of the attributes of a

"confession". The relevant considerations that, whether the l SI appellant

did admit a particular act, whether he did admit that act caused the death

of the deceased, and whether he did admit that particular act was done

with a murderous intention should be applicable to and only if the answer

is in the affirmative a statement can be considered a confession. At the

most, the l SI appellant had admitted that he knew the identity of the

person who was shot at inside the bus by the same evening and as such, it

is clear that the said utterance does not qualify to be termed as a

"confession", triggering in the absolute prohibition under Section 25 of the

Evidence Ordinance, for admitting it as an item of evidence. The evidence

is clear that the lsi appellant was in the car and the deceased was shot at

inside a bus. The lsi appellant had not seen the shooting. He may have

wished for the death of the deceased because of the impending trial before

the High Court and must have felt relieved upon hearing the news that he

was shot at when he uttered those words. But that is not the required

criterion for the said utterance to be treated as a "confession". Hence, this

contention by the 1st appellant must be termed as a contention without

merit.

The contention by the 1st appellant that the trial Court had failed to

consider the alibi of the 1st appellant should be considered next.

It is observed by this Court that in respect of the alibi, the 1st

appellant, in his dock statement stated that on 21.11.2004 he was patrolling

the areas of Biyagama, Sapugaskanda, Waduwegama and Siyambalape with

RPC Pradeep in a private vehicle bearing No. 65 - 8621 and had thereafter

visited the garage in which he had put his own vehicle for repairs at 11.30

a.m. Then he went on to inspect the perimeters of the Biyagama Investment

Promotion Zone, after making enh'ies at 11.45 a.m. in the books

maintained at the police post of the said Zone.

The 1st appellant submitted that the prosecution evidence itself had

supported his alibi and therefore the trial Court was clearly in error when

it rejected his defence and convicted for the two offences he was charged

with.

In order to determine the validity of the basis of rejection of the alibi

of the 1st appellant by the trial Court, it is relevant to consider the

submissions he made before the said Court in support of his defence. It is

revealed that the submissions were made by the 1st appellant before the

trial Court on the footing that OIC of Kandana Police Chandana Abeysekera

39

confirmed that he received information that a person was shot at inside a

bus only at 12.00 noon. But the books maintained at the checkpoint located

in the Biyagama Investment Promotion Zone indicate that on 21.11.2004,

the 1st appellant had visited and inspected it at 11.45 a.m. It was also

highlighted before the trial Court that this fact is confirmed by the

Manager of the Biyagama Investment Promotion Zone Ariyadasa Rajapakse

who stated in evidence that 1st appellant had left its main gate at 12.45 p.m.

in a vehicle bearing No. 65-8625, although due to some oversight there was

no corresponding entry in relation to the time of his arrival. The 1st

appellant had stressed that the prosecution had therefore failed to call any

evidence in rebuttal of his position and accordingly he ought to be cleared

of any criminality over the two counts.

However, the trial Court was not convinced of the alibi of the 1st

appellant and that it had created a reasonable doubt in its mind. The

Court had rejected the said defence as there was clear evidence from the

evidence of "independent" witnesses Jayaseelan and Ajith Shantha who

stated that the actual shooting occurred sometime between 10.30 and 11.00

that morning and therefore the 1st appellant's presence at the Investment

Promotion Zone at 11.45 a.m. had no bearing on the probability of the

claim of the prosecution that he was at the place of shooting. The 1st

appellant was in control of the vehicle and the distance between the place

of incident and Investment Promotion Zone is not an impossible one to

travel in the given period of time. The trial Court supported its view

considering the subsequent conduct of the 1st appellant in removing the

books maintained the police post of Investment Promotion Zone without

the approval of its Officer-in-Charge which lead to the justifiable inference

40

that the entries relied on by him might not reflect the actual position. It

was the 1st appellant himself made those entries.

The task before this Court is to examine the validity of the

conclusion reached by the trial Court in consideration of the totality of the

evidence that had been placed before it and determine whether the said

rejection of the alibi could be supportable on those evidence.

The proceedings indicate that the 1st appellant had cross-examined

jayaseeLan and Ajith Shantha on the incident but did not suggest that he

was elsewhere at the time of shooting probably due to the fact that none of

them had stated that he was there inside the bus. But strangely when

witness Pradeep Kumara was cross examined by the 1st appellant, only two

references were made about the appellants visit to De La Rue. The witness

was only questioned about whether he was taken to the said place by the cm and was replied in the negative. He was then questioned whether the cm questioned him about De La Rue and was answered it in the

affirmative. Except for these two references, the 1st appellant did not

suggest that at the time of shooting he was elsewhere at 11.45 a.m.

Similarly, the 1st appellant had failed to suggest his alibi to witness

Amarakoon and even omitted to make any reference to De la Rue at all

during his otherwise lengthy cross-examination.

IF Chanaka de Silva, is the principle Investigating Officer and he gave

evidence for the prosecution regarding his investigations of the alibi taken

up by the 1st appellant by stating that he visited the De La Rue check point.

In the process, IP Silva had recorded statements of SI Herath, ChandimaL

jayasinghe, Prasad Perera, Ani! Kushantha and Vinitha Bandara, in addition to

41

that of the two appellants, in verifying this claim. When he wanted to take

charge of the Information Book maintained at Investment Promotion Zone

check point in order to verify the claim of the 1st appellant on 29.11.2006, it

was learnt that those books were already removed from the point by the

said appellant. Having examined the CCTV footage recorded by the

security camera system of Oe la Rue security printing facility, located

within the said Investment Promotion Zone, he noted that the 1st

appellant had entered the said premises at 12.31 p.m. and had left it at

12.39 p.m.

The 1st appellant claims that he made entries of his visit to the check

point at 11.45 a.m. and had left there by 12.45 p.m.

These items of evidence clearly establish the fact that the 1st

appellant had in fact visited the said facility. Whether this was at 12.31

p.m. as the CCTV footage indicates or at 11.45 a.m. as the entry made by

the 1st appellant indicate was hardly material when one considers the

evidence available before trial Court in this regard. The reasons for this

conclusion are discussed below.

The all-important question in this regard is what is the correct time

of shooting of the deceased.

Witnesses Jayaseelan states that his bus had commenced its journey

towards Colombo around 9.30 or 9.45 as usual from Avariwatta. He

estimates the time of the shooting as 10.25 a.m. Then he went to Kandana

Police Station at about 11.30 a.m. or 12.00 noon. During cross-examination

by the 1st appellant, it was elicited that in his statement to Police the

witness had stated that the bus reached to Mabole Junction (located in

42

close proximity to the place of the incident) at about 11.50 a.m. It was also

his evidence that after the deceased was rushed to Ragama hospital he had

gone initially to Wattala Police Station to inform them of shooting. They

have directed him to report the incident to Kandana Police Station which

the witness did at about 11.30 a.m.

Ajith Shantha states that the incident took place sometime between

around 11.30 a.m. and 12.00 noon that morning. Amarakoon admitted that

he is unable to estimate time while Pmdeep Kumara states that by 11.20 a.m.

he had got into a bus after the incident.

Thus, it is clear that the times indicated in the evidence of these

witnesses are only rough estimates of time and does not reflect an

accurate position.

However, the evidence of IP Wasantha Kumra reveals that Wattala

Police Station had relayed information over radio communications to his

mobile patrol vehicle at 11.45 a.m. informing them of the shooting and

directing them to proceed to the place of the incident. This could well be

due to Jayaseelan informing the Police about the shooting at about 11.30

a.m. as he claims. If he was to convey that information to Police by 11.30

a.m. he would have left the crime scene sometime before 11.30 a.m .. For

the witness to reach Kandana Police Station at 11.30 a.m. having first gone

to Wattala Police Station, it is safe to assume that he would have left the

place of shooting at least 15 - 30 minutes prior to 11.30 a.m. This

estimation is exclusive of the time the witness Jayaseelan had spent soon

after the shooting contemplating over what should be done in the

circumstances. This places the time of shooting within the time period

43

between 10.30 and 11.30 that morning. If the car driven by the lSI

appellant had left the scene by 11.15 a.m. then he could well have

reached the Investment Promotion Zone at 11.45 a.m. as he claims. If the

lSI appellant had reached there by 12.31 p.m. as per CCTV footage, then he

had more than one hour to reach the Investment Promotion Zone.

In addition to this evidence, it was elicited by the lSI appellant

through witness Pradeep Kumra that he lied when he stated to CID that the

lSI appellant visited the garage of one Chuti and then visited De La Rue with

him and returned at 12.30 p.m. During cross examination by the 2nd

appellant, witness Pradeep Kumara stated that before he went to CID on 4'h

December to make a statement, the lsI appellant instructed him to

remember a certain thing (" o @<;ool"). When probed by the 2nd appellant,

the witness had disclosed in his evidence what that "thing" was;

G: i!\61Or 8~O~@lD 11.45 ClClO @~@!. 6 @Cl@!~ OlD.!D@! 60lD.!D

6Clo). 6 5Cll 6Clo)."

44

Except for the omnibus suggestion that the witness is lying, there

was no specific suggestion that this item of evidence, that challenged the

validity of the alibi of the 1st appellant, is a fabrication either by the

witness himself or by the CID.

It is therefore clear from the available evidence that the shooting had

taken place sometime before 11.30 a.m. that morning since that

information had reached the Police Station and conveyed to the mobile

unit by 11.45 a.m. There is no entry regarding the time the 1st appellant

had entered the Investment Promotion Zone but there is one indicating he

left at 12.45 p.m.

When IP de Silva viewed the CCTV footage, he noted that the 1st

appellant had entered the De la Rue facility only at 12.31 p.m. and that fact

coupled with the evidence of Pradeep Kumara that he was instructed to skip

the time of shooting in his statement to CID, indicate the status of his alibi.

According to the statement made by the 1st appellant from the dock,

he had visited a garage at 11.30 a.m. to check on his vehicle and then

visited De la Rue checkpoint at 11.45 a.m. But he did not offer any

explanation as to the time gap between 11.45 a.m. and 12.31 p.m. No

witness from the garage was called by the 1st appellant in support of his

alibi. This is relevant because the 1st appellant stated he visited the garage

at 11.30.am.

Even if the 1st appellant's timing is accepted, still he could well be at

the murder scene as the trial Court has held.

This is a clear indication that the trial Court had considered the alibi

of the 1st appellant in the light of the three positions as enumerated by the 45

Court of Criminal Appeal in YallOnis Singho v The Queen 67 N.L.R. 8. The

trial Court had rejected the alibi of the 1st appellant but nonetheless

considered it in the light of the time gap since the shooting which took

place sometime around 11.30 a.m.. The Court was of the view, yet the

appellants could have been at the crime scene. This reflects that the Court

had considered the alibi in its intermediate position and rejected. Although

the 1st appellant challenged the time of the shooting, as determined by the

trial Court, he merely stated that the said assumption is wrong.

In the circumstances, this Court endorses the view adopted by the

trial Court in relation to the alibi of the 1st appellant. This ground of appeal

therefore necessarily fails.

Lastly, in relation to the appeal of the 1st appellant, the ground of

appeal that the trial Court had failed to consider the items of

circumstantial evidence, presented by the prosecution, were "tainted with

fundamental vice" should be considered by this Court.

In presenting this particular contention, the 1st appellant relied on

most of the complaints he had already made under his ground of appeal

on fair trial principles.

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court clearly indicate that it had

approached the case presented by the prosecution as a case based on items

of circumstantial evidence. At the very outset of its judgment, the trial

Court had noted so when it discussed the applicable legal principles. It

had then proceeded on to itemise the relevant primary facts that had been

established by the prosecution. Having summarised the several items of

circumstantial evidence that had been placed before it, as spoken to by the

46

witnesses, the trial Court had then proceeded to analyse them in the latter

part of its judgment. During this analysis, the trial Court had made

references to the proved primary facts and the inferences it had drawn

upon those primary facts.

In Kusumadasa v State (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 240, this Court had

identified and listed out the fundamental principles which govern the

applicable considerations of the cases that are based on items of

circumstantial evidence by making references to principles already laid

down in the long line of authorities it had referred to. Sisira de Abrew J.

states:

"1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial

evidence the proved i terns of circumstan tial evidence when

taken together must irresistibly point towards the only

inference that the accused committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that

can be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the

accused only.

2. if on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence

if an inference can be drawn which is consistent with the

innocence of the accused, then one cannot say that the

charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial

evidence the only inference that can be drawn is that the

accused committed the offence then they can be found guilty.

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the

accused had the opportunity of committing the offence, the

47

accused can be found guilty only and only if the proved

items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt

and inconsistent with their innocence."

Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, T

hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence if proved facts are

consistent with the innocence of the accused, he must be acquitted.

Further if the proved facts are not consistent with the guilt of the

accused, he must be acquitted. T have earlier pointed out that some

proved facts are consistent with the innocence of the accused and

also not consistent with the guilt of the accused. Therefore, the

appellant should be acqui tted.

Tn my view, in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of

guilt is to be drawn such inference must be the one and only

irresistible and inescapable inference."

It must be noted that the trial Court, although it did not refer to all

of the above quoted principles in its judgment, by and large, had applied

those principles in its evaluation of the evidence, on the primary facts

proved by that evidence and finally entering a verdict of guilt against the

appellants.

Learned Additional Solicitor General had listed out the several items

of circumstantial evidence that had been placed before the trial Court in

his submissions in support of the conviction of the appellants. In this

judgment, most of these circumstances have already been considered in

detail. However, it is appropriate at this stage of the judgment to refer to

48

them, at least briefly, to facilitate consideration of the 1st appellant's

concerns that had not been addressed so far by this Court.

The prosecution had invited attention of this Court of its case

primarily on three main sectors. Firstly, it submitted that there was a very

strong motive for the 1st appellant to eliminate the deceased as he posed a

very serious threat of giving evidence against the appellant in the case

before the Negombo High Court, upon the failure of his repeated and

desperate attempts to arrive at a "settlement" with the deceased. Secondly,

it was submitted that on the day of the shooting the conduct of the

appellants justifies an inference of the existence of a conspiracy to murder

the deceased and the execution of that conspiracy with active participation

of both the appellants. Thirdly, it was highlighted that the conduct of the

appellants, particularly the 1st appellant, in the aftermath of the shooting

coupled with his attempt to create an artificial defence of alibi is supportive

of the conclusions reached by the trial Court.

In the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, evidence regarding

the second and third sectors have been dealt adequately and it would be

superfluous to record here the findings already reached.

With regard to the strong motive, the 1st appellant had highlighted

the fact that the deceased had said that he was not assaulted by the said

appellant and is prepared to say that in Court. Upon this evidence, the 1st

appellant had contended that this factor had heavily diluted the

prosecution's contention that there was" strong" motive for him to plan

some harm on the deceased.

49

/

The evidence is that the 1st appellant had initially made attempts

through Jayashantha to persuade the deceased to withdraw his complaint.

The 1st appellant had even paid the debts of Jayashantha amounting to Rs.

40,000.00 as a reward for his part in persuading the deceased. The

deceased, however, was reluctant to take such a drastic step and wanted to

consult his lawyers who apparently had discouraged him from

withdrawing his complaint. The deceased then conveyed that he would

tell Court that the 1st appellant did not assault him during his period of

detention. In addition to Jayashantha the 1st appellant had enlisted a

Provincial Councillor to intervene on his behalf to negotiate with the

deceased. This local politician had visited the deceased twice at his

residence. There was no shift of the position of the deceased, yet the 1st

appellant persisted through the politician. The second visit by the

politician was on the night of the 20th November, just hours before the

mid-morning of 21st November, on which, the deceased was shot at and

wounded fatally.

When the chronology of the events in relation to the reconciliation

efforts initiated by the 1st appellant is considered the desperation shown by

him in trying to arrive at a "settlement" even prior to few days to the

commencement of the High Court prosecution becomes evident. The

apparent "softening" of stance by the deceased to exclude him from the list

of persons who assaulted whilst in custody had not made any impact at all

with the lSI appellant. Therefore, this Court is inclined to accept the

submissions of the learned Additional Solicitor General on this point.

50

Having considered the several grounds of appeal as urged by the 1"

appellant, this Court now moves to consider the appeal of the 2nd

appellant.

Learned President's Counsel for the 2nd appellant, in support of his

appeal invited the attention of Court to the following items of evidence

that had not been considered by the trial Court before it arrived at an

adverse finding, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.

a. the fact that witness Pradeep Kumara did not make any reference

to the 2nd appellant in the first of his three statements made to

CID and made a reference to him only in his 4th statement,

b. the fact that the Magistrate's Court, in holding the identification

parade with the 2nd appellant's participation, had failed to verify

the identity of the witnesses who had covered their faces,

c. the fact that Jayaseelan's evidence had been challenged by the

appellants, erroneously noted as it had not been challenged,

d. that witness Jayaseelan did not mention that 2nd appellant had

carried a gWl in his hand as he alighted the bus,

e. the fact that during initial stage of investigation no employee of

"Manoj Tyre Service Centre" had volunteered any information

about the incident of shooting,

f. the fact that Manoj Tyre Service Centre was located away from the

main road, and there was no clear view was available to it of the

place where the bus was stalled

g. the fact that prosecution had failed to elicit clear evidence to the

exact time of shooting,

51

h. the telephone call details between the two SIM cards does not

support the prosecution case,

I. the recovery of the SIM from Gayan amounts to a discovery of

fact under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance,

j. the failure of the trial Court to consider the several

inconsistencies marked off the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses,

k. the prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the body on

which the post mortem examination was held and report was

prepared and produced by the medical witness.

The claim by the 2nd appellant that witness Pradeep Kumara did not

mention his name in the first of the three statements that were recorded

and only mentioned about him in the 4th statement was not considered by

the trial Court is factually incorrect. The witness was cross-examined by

the 2nd appellant of the dialog that he claimed to have overheard that took

place between the 1st appellant and SI Herath, who is a co-accused in the

pending case before the High Court of Negombo case about the deceased.

These statements were made by the witness to the CID. Then the 2nd

appellant marked a contradiction marked as 2VlO, where the witness

stated to CID that he had left in search of one Jerad on the following

morning with the 2nd appellant and two others. Then he was cross-

examined about a statement he made to CID whilst in remand custody

where he claimed to have stated that the 2nd accused was not in good

terms with him. No omissions were marked and no dates of these

statements were elicited where the above references have been made.

52

This is essentially a factor in assessing credibility of the witness, if

the position advanced by the 2nd appellant is factually correct and if that

had been highlighted before the trial Court it could have considered it. The

2nd appellant failed to do that and therefore cannot expect the trial Court to

consider any imaginary grounds in order to discredit a witness.

The 2nd appellant complained about witness covering their faces at

the Identification Parade. This is a ground that had been raised before the

trial Court itself by the 2nd appellant. This ground is based on the factual

basis that the witnesses who identified the 2nd appellant at an

Identification Parade held before the Magistrate's Court of Wattala have

covered themselves up in order to conceal their identities when they

inspected the parade. Therefore, the 2nd Appellant contended that there

was no opportunity for the learned Magistrate to satisfy that the person

who pointed out the 2nd appellant is the witness who was produced before

her prior to the line-up. The 2nd appellant's claims that this fact raises a

reasonable doubt as to the identity of the witnesses who claimed to have

identified him at the said Identification parade.

The prosecution led the evidence of the Magistrate who conducted

the Identification Parade. She was emphatic that having verified the

identities and other details of the four witnesses, prior to the parade she

had then placed them under the supervision of a Court sergeant in a

secluded room adjacent to her Chambers. It had no other access. When the

witnesses were interviewed before the parade, they were in their normal

attire but when each of them came before the parade, they have covered

themselves with rain coats and only their eyes were visible. She verified

53

their identities by asking for names and did identify them through their

voices.

During cross-examination by the 2nd appellant, the witness

reaffirmed that she identified the witnesses through their voice. The 2nd

appellant did not challenge this claim of identity by the witness by

suggesting that she did not know who was under the rain coat or whether

she had any doubts as to who could be under the concealed identity. He

did not even challenge at least that voice identification of strangers is

unreliable to the witness who could have offered clarifications to her claim

of identity. In addition, there was no corresponding challenge when each

of these witnesses gave evidence on this point. This is therefore clearly a

claim by the 2nd appellant without any valid ground in support.

The law provides for the witnesses to make identifications from a

concealed position and thereby not risking revelation of their identities to

the suspects who are prod uced for the parade. Section 124 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 was amended by Section 2 of the

Act No. 11 of 1988 to facilitate implementing this important safeguard to

protect the interests of witnesses. The practical constraints that exists in the

criminal justice system unfortunately do not enable our Courts to hold

parades by providing the witnesses with required infrastructure facilities

where they could examine the parade behind the cover of a one-way

mirror so that the suspects who are placed on the other side cannot see the

witnesses who pointed out them from their side.

In the instant appeal, the prosecution however employed the

unorthodox method already described to conceal the identity of the

54

vulnarable witnesses who may have been under threats at the time of their

participation at the Identification Parades. The rights of the suspects were

ensured by the learned Magistrate who took extra precautions to hold the

parade probably and none of the parties were prejudiced.

In relation to the complaint made by the 2nd appellant that the trial

Court was wrong when it stated that he did not challenge the evidence of

witness Jayaseelan since he had marked a contradiction (2V3) over the

witness's claim that he had a gun in his hand and thereby failed to note

that the appellant had challenged his credibility should be examined next.

It should be observed that the trial Court, in its narration of the

evidence of Jayaseelan noted that the 2nd appellant had cross examined the

witness but was of the view that there were only trivial inconsistencies

that were highlighted in the process. However, in the analysis of evidence,

the trial Court states that his evidence was "not challenged". When this

statement is considered in the light of its earlier statement in the judgment,

it is clear that what the trial Court means with the phrase "not challenged"

is that there was no sufficient challenge to rule that the evidence of witness

Jayaseelan is not truthful and therefore unreliable.

The 2nd appellant also highlighted that the witness Jayaseelan,

although claims to have seen the appellant with a gun in his hand, failed

to mention that fact in his statement resulting an inconsistency on this vital

item of evidence and the trial Court failed to take note of it when it

considered his evidence. The 2nd appellant sought to fortify his submission

on this issue by pointing out the inconsistencies as to the distance the 2nd

appellant seems to have travelled after boarding the bus.

55

It must be noted that even though an inconsistency was marked

2V3, there appears to be no such inconsistency. The witness speaks of a

gun in the hands of the 2nd appellant in evidence and it appears that what

he told elsewhere is that the 2nd appellant had no "goods"( " iilg @Jqo\

6l@M\ 0Jr3lz") in his hand. The witness is from a different ethnicity and he

gave evidence in Sinhalese and not in his mother tongue. Strangely, the 2nd

appellant failed to highlight an omission that he did fail to mention that

the appellant carried a gun in his hand and was content with marking only

2V3. Hence, this could not be taken as a contradiction in its technical sense

and even if it is considered as a contradiction, makes no dent in the

credibility of the witness on that score only.

Another inconsistency highlighted by the 2nd appellant was the

variance of evidence between IP Chanaka and IP Kudagoda as to who had

the custody of the witnesses when they were presented for the

I identification parade. IP Silva denied having taken any part in the

production of witnesses but Kudagoda claims it was IP Chanaka who

brought the witnesses to Court. Witness Ajith Shantha offered a

clarification to this apparent inconsistency. According to him it was IP

Chanaka who accompanied him to the Magistrate's Court and was then

handed over to a Jailer and some Police Officers. This shows IP Chanaka's

limited role in relation to the witnesses.

In its evaluation of evidence, it is clear that the trial Court was aware

of the discrepancies that existed between the testimonies of the witnesses

for the prosecution, but was convinced that despite those infirmities they

56

were speaking the truth in Court. The infirmities that had been brought to

the notice of the trial Court are certainly attributable to human weaknesses

in observation and faulty memory. Is it reasonable to expect from a

conductor to keep a tab on every passenger who boards a bus with exact

details of them? The answer is clearly in the negative. This Court also

holds the view that none of these inconsistencies are sufficient to assail

the testimonial trustworthiness of these witnesses.

Consideration of the approach adopted by the trial Court in its

undertaking of evaluation of the evidence for its credibility, one could

identify the application of the principles that had been enunciated in the

judgment of Samaraweera v Attorney General (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 256. In the

said judgment, this Court adopted a pragmatic approach even in an

instance where the witness was found to have uttered falsehood under

oath. In assessing the h'uthfulness and reliability of such evidence it was

held:

" The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus could not be

applied in such circumstances Further all falsehood is not

deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of

skill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration

or mere embroidery or embellishment must be distinguished

from deliberate falsehood before applying the maxim. Nor

does the maxim apply to cases of testimony on the same point

between different witnesses. In any event this maxim is not

an absolute rule which has to be applied without exception in

every case where a witness is shown to have given false

evidence on a material point. When such evidence is given by

57

a witness the question whether other portions of his evidence

can be accepted as true may not be resolved in his favour

unless there is some compelling reason for doing so. The

credibility of witnesses can be treated as divisible and

accepted against one and rejected against another. The jury

or judge must decide for themselves whether that part of the

testimony which is found to be false taints the whole or

whether the false can safely be separated from the true."

None of the prosecution witnesses belong to this category of

witnesses and since almost all of the inconsistencies that have been

highlighted seemed to have not affected the impression created in the

mind of the trial Court as to their the truthfulness of the sequence of events

the witnesses have spoken of, this Court is reluctant to interfere with this

finding of fact.

It is apparent that the trial Court, in dealing with the inter se and per

se inconsistencies that were highlighted off the evidence of prosecution

witnesses, have applied the principles that are laid down in the judgments

of Bandaranike v Jagathsena (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397 and Best Footwear (Pvt)

Ltd., and Others v Aboosally and Others (Supra).

In Bandaranike v Jagathsena (ibid), it was held that:

"When versions of two witnesses do not agree the trial judge

has to consider whether the discrepancy is due to dishonesty

or to defective memory or whether the witness' powers of

observation were limited. Tn weighing the evidence, the trial

judge must take into consideration the demeanour of the

58

witness in the witness box. Was she tnjing to the best of her

abili ty to speak the tru th ?"

Similarly in the judgment of Best Footwear (Pvt) Ltd., and Others v

Aboosally and Others (Supra) it was stressed that:

"In evaluating the evidence of a witness a court or a tribunal

is not entitled to reject testimony and arrive at an adverse

finding in regard to testimonial trustworthiness and

credibility on the mere proof of contradiction or the existence

of a discrepancy. The deciding authority must weigh and

evaluate the discrepancy and ascertain whether the

discrepancy does go to the root of the matter and shake the

basic version of the witness. If it does not, such discrepancies

cannot be given too much importance."

In the circumstances, this Court is in full agreement with the view of

the trial Court that the witnesses who were called by the prosecution have

spoken the truth before the trial Court and were corroborated by material

particulars.

Another complaint made by the 2nd appellant is that the claim by the

witness Ajith Sahantha that he saw the appellant getting into a white car

with a gun in hand is clearly an improbable one owing to two reasons.

Firstly, the investigators, having visited the scene soon after the incident

was reported, invited any witness to the incident to come forward and

there was none. Secondly the investigating officer states that the tyre

centre, where the witness attended to a tyre puncture at the time of

shooting as its technician, was located some distance away from the place

59

where the bus was stopped and as such the witness would not have had

any opportunity of witnessing the 2nd appellant getting into a car.

Both these questions undoubtedly are questions of fact but

unfortunately not been raised by the 2nd appellant in his closing

submissions to the trial Court. However, those questions of fact have been

determined against the 2nd appellant by the trial Court.

It is his contention that the trial Court had also failed to consider

evidence of CI Attanayaka.

It is stated by CI Attanayaka of Kandana Police that he visited the

scene on the 21.11.2004 at 2.00 p.m. and questioned about fifty persons to

find someone who could provide information relating to the incident. He

had visited Samarasinghe Oil Stores and Manoj Tyre Service Centre in his

attempt to trace any witnesses since they were located closer to the place of

incident but there was no one who volunteered from the said tyre service

centre to offer any information. It was also revealed through this official

witness that until the CID took over investigations on 28.11.2004, the

statement of witness Ajith Shantha was not recorded. This witness also

stated that Manoj Tyre Service Centre was located away from the main road

and also on a lower elevation to that of the main road.

In relation to the late discovery of the witness Ajith Shantha, this

Court must consider whether the prosecution offered any explanation to

the delay since it concerns the test spontaneity of the version narrated by

the witness.

IP Chanaka Silva stated that the statement of Ajith Shantha was

recorded on 09.12.2004 and Manoj Tyre Service Centre was located about 10

60

to 15 meters away from the scene. He further stated during cross

examination by the 1st appellant that Ajith Shantha was reluctant to make a

statement initially due to fear of reprisals and as a result his statement was

finally recorded only on 17.01.2007. In replying to the 2nd appellant, the

witness stated that Ajith Shanta's statement was recorded at 3.30 p.m. at his

work place. The witness denied the suggestion put to rum that the witness

was in the custody of the CID for over three days prior to making a

statement. However, witness Ajith Shantha stated in his evidence that he

made a statement after a lapse of two days since the incident and he could

not recollect the name of the officer to whom he made his statement. The

witness claims that he was taken to CID twice. On the first occasion his

statement was not recorded but subsequently they recorded one but he

cannot recall exactly when. He was questioned about the facial

characteristics of the person who had a gun and then a sketch was

prepared upon the information he had provided.

The 2nd appellant had clarified from the witness that he was taken to

CID after two days from the shooting when he was working at his tyre

centre.

In his submissions, the 2nd appellant stated that the trial Court had

even failed to narrate the evidence of Ajith Shantha and his evidence was

led before the succeeding trial Judge under Section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance. Therefore, he contended that the trial Court had totally left

out the evidence of this witness from its consideration.

It is correct that there is no detailed narration of the evidence of the

said witness in the judgment. But the trial Court had clearly stated in its

61

I

judgment that" oz.0.01 (l)OllD qO@CllflD 03) oz.0.02 g~o q)lO w~ OO@O

is explained by the trial Court as ; "00 og Clz(l)o\ Olo\/iiCllOz ~@O ~Cllaro Olo\/ii

'W~a@o <;zroc:>o\ 06Clll qzCl."

In assessing the evidence of the witness applying the test of

spontaneity, the explanation that is evident from the material placed

before the trial Court is that the witness was reluctant to come forward as a

witness. This is unfortunately the reality in our times. The civic

mindedness of the members of our society in assisting investigations by

volunteering information is easily overshadowed by the difficulties such

a person had to endure due to certain limitations in our Criminal Justice

System if he presents himself as a wib1ess. Sadly, this is the reality in the

present times and the Courts must be alive to these social realities in

assessing the genuineness of the reluctance shown by a potential

witnesses. This was well before the enactment of Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Wib1ess's Act No.4 of 2015 and there

was no effective mechanism to protect the witnesses from the dangers they

are exposed to by virtue of being a witness to a crime at that time. Security

of the witnesses may have been a serious issue in this trial since the CIO

62

had made an application to conceal identities of the witnesses it had

planned to present at an identification parade to identify the suspects.

Witness Jayaseelan confirms the existence of witness Ajith Shantha as

he stated in evidence that soon after the shooting he learnt that the person

who got off from his bus with a gun, had got into a white car and sped

away, from an employee of a nearby tyre shop. This is a clear indication

that Ajith Shantha's claim of seeing the 2nd appellant is not at all a fiction or

a fabrication by an interested party. The 2nd appellant did not challenge

Aijit Shantha's evidence during cross-examination when the witness stated

that he provided information as to facial characteristics of the person who

had a gun in his hand to cm. That fact clearly supports the prosecution

version that the witness did in fact see the person with a gun.

Thus the complaint of the 2nd appellant in relation to this witness is

clearly without any semblance of validity.

The 2nd appellant, in challenging the prosecution case, contended

that the evidence in support of its claim that there was an exchange of

telephone calls between the lsi appellant and witness Amarakoon where the

former was giving instructions to the latter in fact destroys the prosecution

theory at its base. It was submitted by the 2nd appellant that the several

calls that were exchanged between the two numbers were initiated when

the witness was inside the car with the 1st appellant and therefore it is

highly improbable to use telephones to communicate between two

individuals who travelled in the same vehicle at the same time. In fairness

to the 2nd appellant, it is seen that he made identical submissions before the

trial Court on this point in his closing submissions.

63

The trial Court rejected this contention as it observed the times of

these calls and the different events as spoken to by the witnesses do match

with each other.

This contention of the 2nd appellant and its corresponding finding of

the trial Court should be considered for its merits and demerits in the

backdrop of the evidence that had been presented before the trial Court on

this point.

It is the claim of the prosecution that, when the 1st appellant

dropped off witness Amarakoon at some point after passing the railway

crossing at Gampaha, given him instructions that if he sees a person of

dark complexion with a stocky build to call him. The witness had a mobile

phone with a SIM card corresponding to the number 0722779216. The

witness, during the 30 to 45 minute period he waited in anticipation with

a person with the matching description, had made and received several

calls to and from the 1st appellant. The prosecution also claimed that at

that time, the 1st appellant was contactable under number 0776273037.

The call details among these two phone numbers on 21.11.2004 were

presented through the relevant service provider by the prosecution. In

order to test the validity of the contention of the 2nd appellant, it is helpful

to tabulate the call details which would then reveal the correct perspective.

The details of the calls among the numbers 0722779216 and

0776273037 for the morning of 21.11.2004 are as follows:

64

Time of Call Duration of the call in seconds Time Gap between each call in minutes

10.19 a.m. 23

10.30 a.m. 52 11

10.47 a.m. 29 17

10.53 a.m. 57 6

10.55 a.m. 23 2

11.02 a.m. 42 7

11.10 a.m. 57 8

11.12 a.m. 10 2

11.29 a.m. 22 17

11.32 a.m. 3 3

12.40 p.m. 54 8

These call details reveal a clearly identifiable pattern. There were 8

calls between 10.39 a.m. and 11.12 a.m. Then there is a comparatively a

large gap of 17 minutes of silence between 11.12 a.m. call and 11.29 a.m.

call, followed by another call after just three minutes at 11.32 a.m. Then the

last call from any of these SIM cards was taken at 12.40 p.m. until they

were finally recovered by the em on 10.12.2004 during their

investigations.

The prosecution led the circumstances under which these calls were

taken through one of the callers since the caller at the other end was the 1st

appellant himself.

Arnarakoon stated that he had taken and received several calls when

he was stationed as a lookout, and due to the failure of the deceased to

turn up at that point as expected. The witness was there waiting for about

30 to 45 minutes. He was then picked up by the 1st appellant. Thereafter,

the 2nd appellant and Pradeep Kurnara have boarded the bus which was

65

travelling in front of them as per the instructions of the 1st appellant.

After some time, the bus was stopped and only the 2nd appellant returned

to the car. Then the three of them have proceeded along and on their way,

the 1st appellant had taken calls from the witness Amarakoon's phone. At

some point he was dropped off by the 1st appellant.

This sequence of physical events matches with the clear pattern of

the calls. The first set of 8 calls were taken during a 43-minute period, the

witness estimates as 30 to 45 minutes, is the waiting time for the deceased

. Then the gap of 17 minutes of silence could be attributable to the time of

his pickup by the 1st appellant, the bus episode and picking up of the 2nd

appellant after gun shots were heard. Then there were two calls taken

within a gap of just three minutes. The call at 11.29 a.m. lasted just three

seconds. These calls are attributed to the 1st appellant by witness

Amarakoon . Then the call log shows that the last call to be taken before the

connection between the two phones died down for the next 19 days, was

taken at 12.40 p.m.

Interestingly, the time period during which the shooting took place,

as estimated by this Court after considering the testimony of the lay

witnesses, coincide with the period of 17- minute silence between the two

phones.

Contrary to the contention of the 2nd appellant, the phone details are

not only consistent with the prosecution version of events but also

strengthens it.

In his contention on this point, the 2nd appellant raised another

concern over the recovery of the SIM from witness Amarakoon claiming

66

applicability of provisions of Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance since

at the time of its recovery the witness was considered as a suspect. Clearly

this submission is based on misinterpretation of the provisions of Section

27(1) since it applies to situations where the person against whom the

evidence relating to the recovery is sought to be proved should be "a

person accused of offence" before a Court where such evidence could be

led, and not in police custody where only investigations are carried out

against him treating him as a suspect of an offence.

The final contention advanced by the 2nd appellant that the

prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the body on which the post

mortem examination was held and a report was prepared is founded upon

the factual position that the witnesses who claims to have identified the

body of the deceased just before the post mortem examination was not

called nor listed as witnesses by the prosecution. Thereby, the 2nd appellant

claims that the prosecution had failed to prove two vital element in its

case, namely that Waragoda Mudalige Jerad Mervin Perera is dead and his

death was due to gunshot injuries.

It was submitted by the 2nd appellant that the post mortem report

(Pl1) indicates that the body of the deceased was identified by W.M.L.

Perera said to be a younger brother of the deceased and W.P.L.

Wickramatilaka his brother-in- law before Dr. Dayapala, the Consultant JMO.

None of these two witnesses were called to testify before the trial Court by

the prosecution and therefore there was no acceptable evidence before it

in relation to the identification of the dead body.

67

In his attempt to counter this submission, learned Additional

Solicitor General claimed that the 2nd appellant had raised this issue for the

first time before this Court and that too at the very late stage of his

submissions. He submitted that the two appellants did not challenge these

two aspects before the trial Court and thereby admitted the death and its

cause. Learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon two judgments of

this Court in which similar situations have been considered and decided.

In these judgments, this Court had taken noted of the fact that the failure

to challenge the death would amount to an admission of that very fact. He

also added that if this contention is accepted then it will not be possible to

establish death of a person whose body was never found or recovered.

The claim that the prosecution did not call the two witnesses who

identified the body of the deceased before the Consultant JMO is factually

a correct statement. In the circumstances, this Court must then consider

the basis on which this Court had approached the issue in the two judicial

precedents that had been relied upon by the learned Additional Solicitor

General.

In Baraniwala Liyanage Sunil v Attorney General CA Appeal No.

CA 30/2009 - decided on 27.02.2017, the appellant in that appeal had

raised a similar issue by making a claim that" .. . the witnesses who identified

the body before the Judicial Medical Officer were not called to give evidence and

thereby the corpus has not been identified."

The Court, having noted the fact that the Dr. Gunawardana, while

testifying before the trial Court, had stated that the body was identified by

the witnesses named in his report, relied on the judgment of Sarwan Singh

68

v State of Punjab (2002) II AIR SC 3562, where it was held that "it is rule of

essential justice that whenever the opponent had declined to avail himself of the

opportunity to cross examine the witness, it must follow that the evidence

tendered on that issue ought to be accepted" to reject the appellant's claim on

the basis that" the defence has not disputed the identification of the corpus In

the High Court."

The judgment in Patirennehelage Indika Jayaratne v Attorney

General c.A. Appeal No. CA 83/12 - decided on 18.11.2015, refers to a

situation similar to the one under consideration by this Court. At the trial,

the prosecution had placed evidence which proved that the deceased in

that case had died on his way to the hospital and the medical officer's

evidence that the body was identified before the post mortem examination

was conducted was not challenged by the appellant.

In the said judgment, this Court, having quoted Sarwan Singh v

State of Punjab (supra) and taking note of several other precedents

including the judgment of State of Himachal Pradesh v Thakurdas (1983)

2 Cri L.J. 1964 where it had been held that "whenever a statement of fact made

by a witness is not challenged in cross examination it has to be concluded that the

fact in question is not disputed", rejected the only contention advanced by the

appellant in support of his appeal that" ... body of the of the deceased was not

properly identified."

These two judgments provide answer to the contention advanced by

the 2nd appellant as to the proof of death of the deceased and to its cause.

In addition to the reasoning contained in those judgments, the

contention of the 2nd appellant could be considered by this Court In

69

another perspective. That is when the evidence presented before the trial

Court is considered in its totality whether a reasonable doubt arises as to

the death of the deceased or as to its cause?

Having noted the direction in which the prosecution witnesses, who

speak about his death due to shooting were cross examined, this Court

forms the view that particularly the 2nd appellant, not only failed to

challenge that the deceased died due to gunshot injuries he received,

actually proceeded to cross-examined them on the basis that the deceased

was in fact killed by shooting. This approach adopted by the 2nd appellant

in the cross-examination is amply demonstrated by the suggestion put to

witness Pradeep Kumara. It was suggested to the said witness that it was IP

Herath who wanted to and did kill the deceased but due to personal

animosity the witness had with the 2nd appellant, he was implicated to

that killing. Similarly, the 2nd appellant, during his cross examination of

witness Amarakoon suggested that due to threats from ClD he implicated

the 2nd appellant to this "incident". Clearly the 2nd appellant by his

reference to this "incident" meant the death of the deceased and its cause.

Witness Jayaseelan said in evidence a person was shot inside the bus

and he saw the 2nd appellant with a gun in his hand soon after the shots

were heard. He also said the driver of the bus had thereafter taken the

"injured" to Ragama Hospital in the same bus while he took a three

wheeler to report the incident to Wattala Police who directed him to report

the incident to Kandana Police as it was not in their area. None of these

assertions were challenged by the 2nd appellant during cross-examination

and it was suggested to the witness that, the person who was seated

70

behind to the person who was killed, is the person who shot him using a

pistol.

In addition to the evidence of the consultant JMO, in proof of the

death of the deceased, the prosecution led evidence of Padma

Wickramaratne, the wife of the deceased. She stated in her evidence she had

identified the body of her husband at the inquest and her husband had

died due gunshot injuries. IP Abeysekara, Officer-in-Charge of Kandana

Police, had visited the deceased when he was being treated at the ICU of

Ragama Hospital, prior to his transfer to National Hospital where he

succumbed to his injuries. The deceased stated to the witness that he was

shot at due to his "Wattala Case" and also that he would not survive the

attack. The wallet that was taken charge from the critically wounded

patient's possession by lP Abeysekara contained his National Identity Card

which confirmed the fact that he is the deceased named in the indictment.

The trial Court had recorded the closing submissions made by the

2nd appellant in support of his contention that the prosecution has failed to

prove the charges. Strangely the 2nd appellant did not highlight the fact

that the prosecution did not prove the body identification. On the contrary,

the 2nd appellant clearly submitted to h'ial Court highlighting the factors

the prosecution must prove. He submitted "6 tllJOel!Jo CJ13 qGl @~f~tllJ OQ)O

<jl~5ool tll@@(3JJoI 6 qGl @Clf~tllJ oQ)@o 6l@QJ.!l) tllOtflll OJOJOel!J OZtll@OlD ~Q)Ql() ~og

(3JQlO 6l@QllD@lD @<!I @oGl Clz~ Cl .. tll@~ @<!I @~Clzti\ Clol61 tllOt~ 6l0tll Otll."

Thereby, the 2nd appellant had taken this particular fact in issue

concerning the identity of the deceased and the cause of his death by

71

conceding to that it was due to shooting. Thereby he had narrowed down

the contest on facts only to the issue whether it was the 2nd appellant who

shot the deceased.

In the circumstances, it is obvious that the trial Court was satisfied

beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased named in the indictment had

died and had died due to gunshot injuries as there were sufficient and

uncontroverted evidence to prove those facts. In addition, the 2nd appellant

conceded to these two points in his closing submissions and relieved the

trial Court of its duty in determining the said issue, by undertaking a

lengthy analysis of evidence. In the circumstances, it must be ruled that

this contention of the 2nd appellant on this point is clearly devoid of any

merit.

Having reached to the final segment of this judgment, this Court

must, before it proceeds to determine the validity of the challenge

mounted by the two appellants against their convictions, remind itself of

the role of an appellate Court in determining an appeal challenging a

determination of an original Court.

In King v Attygalle 37 N.L.R. 337, the Privy Council, cited Lord

Sumner from Ibraham v. The King (1914) A. C. 599, to lay emphasis on the

principle, that for an appellate Court to interfere with a determination of a

lower Court:

"There must be something which in the particular case

deprives the accused of the substance of fair trial and the

protection of the law, or which in general tends to divert the

72

due and orderly administration of the law into a new course

which may be drawn into an evil precedent in future"

The Supreme Court, in its comparatively a recent judgment of The

Attorney General v Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292, had the occasion to revisit

the considerations that are applicable to the exercise of appellate function,

in determining appeals against determinations of an original Courts.

Citing English judgments on this issue, the apex Court stated that:

" ... a Court of Appeal should never interfere unless it is

satisfied both that the judgment ought not to stand and that

the divergence of view between the trial Judge and the Court

of Appeal has not occasioned by any demeanour of the

wi tnesses or truer atmosphere of the trial (which may have

eluded the appellate Court) or by any other of those

advantages which the trial Judge possesses."

In relation to the appeal before this Court, the underlying complaint

of the appellants was that the trial Court had accepted the evidence of

several prosecution witnesses, it should not have, in view of the several

infirmities as pointed out by Counsel during the hearing of appeal. As

already noted this essentially is an issue concerning credibility of

witnesses. The determination of credibility of witnesses was undoubtedly

considered as determination of a question of fact. The Supreme Court, in

The Attorney General v Theresa (ibid) stated that" credibility is a question of

fact, not law".

73

As such it was further stated by the apex Court:

" ... appellate Court should not ordinarily interfere with the

trial Court's opinion as to the credibility of a witness as the

trial Judge alone knows the demeanour of the witness; he

alone can appreciate the manner in which the questions are

answered, whether with honest candour or with doubtful

plausibility and whether after a careful thought or with

reckless glibness and he alone can form a reliable opinion as

to whether the witness has emerged with credit from cross

examination. "

It is seen from the proceedings before the trial Court that certain

prosecution witnesses, who have already given evidence before the

predecessor of the learned trial Judge, were recalled when the succeeding

trial Judge commenced his hearing of the partly heard trial. It was that

succeeding trial Judge who delivered the impugned judgment. That was

an opportunity provided to the succeeding trial Court by the appellants

themselves when they made application to recall the witness under Section

48 of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 as amended. Therefore, the learned

trial Judge, who delivered the impugned judgment, has had the

opportunity to observe demeanour and deportment of these witnesses for

himself, and opted to accept them as truthful and reliable witnesses.

It is the credibility of the evidence of those witnesses that were

commented on by the learned President's Counsel before this Court in

support of the appeals of both the appellants. The trial Commenced before

74

that particular trial Judge on 23.03.2007 and the evidence of the

prosecution and defence was over by 28.11.2014. The trial Court delivered

its judgment on 22.06.2015.

In identifying the role of the appellate Court in reviewing a

judgment of an original Court, thjs Court too had identified several

principles and rules for its guidance in the judgment of de Silva and

Others v Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 169. Of these rules, in

determining the instant appeal this Court had particularly applied the rule

that states "the appellate Court should examine whether the trial Judge has

drawn proper inferences from specific facts that are proved" since the appeals of

the two appellants are based on the common plank that the inferences that

had been drawn by the trial Court upon the several items of circumstantial

evidence, as to their guilt were wrong.

Having considered the evidence in its entirety, this Court is of the

firm view that the trial Court had drawn inferences that are justified upon

the proof of primary facts on which those inferences were drawn.

This Court is guided by the observations of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in The King v Andiris Silva et al 41 N.L.R. 433. After the

submissions their Lordships have stated:

" We do not expect Jurymen to be endowed with legal

training nor can we say that our impressions gathered by a

perusal of recorded evidence are as valuable as those of

persons who have heard witnesses give evidence. We might

say that the arguments for the appellants created a strong

75

impression on our minds, and if the Jury had seen fit to

acquit the accused we should not have been able to take

exception to the verdict. All that we are required to say is

that it has not been shown to our satisfaction that the verdict

is unreasonable or that it cannot be supported having regard

to the evidence"

in view of the precedents where:

" ... the English Court has shown in a series of decisions its

disinclination to question a verdict given by a Jury on

questions of fact."

The Court further indicated its view, even in relation to questions of

law, quoting the judgment of R. v. Wyman 13 Cr. App. R. 163 where it is

stated:

" Voluminous particulars illustrative of the original grounds

of appeal were furnished to the Court at a late stage. They

were evidently the creation or conception of some learned

person, who, having the transcript of the shorthand notes of

the evidence and of the summing-up, directed much

ingenuity and industry to picking out from a long and

careful summing up a number of small points, most of which

are frivolous. On these we are asked to upset the conviction if

we can find any possible slight oversight or error of

statement or some inference to be possibly drawn from a

chance phrase or possible immaterial misconstruction of

evidence. The Court does not deal with matters of this kind.

76

We are here to deal only with substantial points of

misdirection. "

In applying the principles laid down in the exercise of appellate

jurisdiction in these binding precedents, this Court, after much thought,

concludes that the appeals of the 1st and 2nd appellants are devoid of merit

and ought to be dismissed on that account.

The convictions of the 1st and 2nd appellants and sentences imposed

them are therefore affirmed by this Court and accordingly their appeals

stand dismissed.
