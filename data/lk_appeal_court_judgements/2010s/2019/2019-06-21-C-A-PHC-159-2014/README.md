Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Whilst serving as the Accountant of the Provincial Road

Development Authority of the North Central Province, the

appellants services were suspended by X7 pending investigation

into wrongful payments disclosed by an Audit Report. The

appellant rushed to the High Court seeking to quash the said

suspension by certiorari and an order for reinstatement by

mandamus. The High Court by Judgment dated 30.10.2014

dismissed that application. It is against that Judgment the

appellant has preferred this appeal.

In the meantime, the disciplinary inquiry has been concluded,

and upon found guilty for the charges, his services have been

terminated (vide Y3). Thereafter upon an appeal preferred

against the said termination (vide Y5), the appellant has been

reinstated, but denied payment of salary during the period of

suspension (vide Y4).

The appellant tendered those documents by way of a motion, but

did not seek to amend the original petition or reliefs.

During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the

appellant informed Court that all what the petitioner now needs

is to lift the suspension in order to be entitled to collect arrears

of the salary during the period of suspension.

The whole application of the appellant in my view is

misconceived in law. The disciplinary procedure for the

employees of the Provincial Road Development Authority of the

North Central Province is contained in Part II of the Gazette

marked X8. According to paragraph 2.1 thereof the disciplinary

authority of the Provincial Road Development Authority of the

North Central Province is the General Manager. According to

paragraph 17 thereof, the General Manger can suspend the

services of an employee pending investigation. The services of

the appellant have been suspended by the General Manager. If

the appellant was dissatisfied with that suspension order, he

ought to have, in terms of paragraph 13 of X8, appealed to the

Secretary of the relevant Ministry of the North Central Provincial

Council, and, if he was dissatisfied with that Appeal decision, he

ought to have appealed to the Labour Tribunal against that

order. He cannot rush to the High Court seeking to quash the

suspension order by certiorari. The dismissal of the application

of the appellant by the High Court is flawless.

The appellant is now playing a hide and seek game. He does not

want to amend the original petition or the reliefs sought. It

appears that he accepts the Appeal decision marked Y4 by

which he was reinstated, but indirectly attacks the qualification

contained therein by which he was denied arrears of salary

during the period of suspension of service. If the appellant is

dissatisfied with the said Appeal decision, it appears to me that,

he shall go before the Labour Tribunal, as provided in paragraph

13.6(b) of X8. In any event, the appellant does not seek any

relief on Y4.

I unhesitatingly dismiss the appeal with costs.
