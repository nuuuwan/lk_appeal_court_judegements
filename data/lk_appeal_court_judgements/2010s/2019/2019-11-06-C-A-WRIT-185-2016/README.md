Decided on: 05.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

A Grant in terms of the Land Development Ordinance, No.19 of

1935, as amended, was issued in the name of Julis Singho in

respect of the land in dispute in this case.

His wife was Podi Hamine. Their three children were

Jayathilake, Gunasoma (the 4th respondent) and Mallika (the 5th

defendant). Jaythilake was the eldest son.

Julis died in 2004; Jayathilake in 2007; and Podi Hamine in

2014.

Julis did not nominate a successor to the land in the Grant.

As seen from inter alia P10A, soon after the fathers death, the

4th respondent has tried to get the ownership of the land, which

had been objected to by his brother, Jayathilake.

3

P23 goes to show that the 1st respondent, the Divisional

Secretary of Hingurakgoda has issued a Grant in the name of

the 4th respondent in respect of the land on 04.01.2016.

The three petitioners who are respectively the widow and the two

children of the aforesaid Jayathilake have filed this application

seeking to quash by writ of certiorari the Grant issued in the

name of the 4th respondent as reflected in P23; and to compel

the 1st respondent, by writ of mandamus, to issue a Grant in

respect of the land in the name of the 2nd petitioner as the eldest

son of Jayathilake.

The respondents have filed objections to this application.

The position taken up by the petitioners in their original petition

was that, as no successor had been nominated by Julis, upon

the death of Julis, the land, in accordance with the Third

Schedule read with section 72 of the Land Development

Ordinance, devolved on Jayathilake (the father of the

petitioners), being the eldest son of Julis, subject to the life

interest of Podi Haminethe wife of Julis (i.e. Jayathilakes

mother); and upon the death of Jayathilake, the land devolved

on the 2nd petitioner, being the eldest son of Jayathilake, subject

to the life interest of the wife of Julis (Podi Hamine); and upon

the death of the wife of Julis (Podi Hamine), the 2nd petitioner

succeeded to the land subject to the life interest of his (the 2nd

petitioners) mother, who is the 1st respondent to this

application.

4

Having (may be) later realized that the law explained above is

not correct, the petitioners amended the original petition to say

that, upon the death of Julis, his wife failed to succeed to the

rights of her deceased husband Julis, as she failed and

neglected to take possession of the land, and therefore, upon the

death of Julis, the land devolved on the eldest son of Julis, who

was the father of the petitioners.

This amendment, in my view, changes the character of the

petitioners action. What has been introduced by the

amendment is an afterthought.

The Land Development Ordinance does not use the words life

interest. If there is no nomination in the Grant, upon the death

of the owner of the holding, the spouse shall, in terms of section

48B, be entitled to succeed to the land by operation of law,

unless, in terms of section 68, the spouse refuses to succeed or

does not enter into possession of the land within six months

from the date of death of the owner.

I agree with the submission of the learned State Counsel that

the automatic succession by the surviving spouse by operation

of law has been introduced to give security to the surviving

spouse (mostly, the wife of the deceased) and thereby to address

a social issue. If the Succession Table set out in the Third

Schedule is to take effect immediately upon the death of the

owner, the surviving spouse could be neglected and left destitute

by children.

5

In my view, the alleged failure to succeed to the land by the

spouse in terms of section 68(1), which is a question of fact,

cannot be raised for the first time in a writ application before the

Court of Appeal. If somebody wants to take up that position, he

shall first raise it before the proper authority such as the

Divisional Secretary or Provincial Commissioner of Lands or

Commissioner General of Lands for them to initiate an inquiry

into it and arrive at a finding. That has not been done by the

petitioners in this case. This Court being a Writ Court cannot

embark upon an inquiry into it. When major facts are in

dispute, writ will not lie.

According to the original petition, the spouse of Julis succeeded

to the land. To use the petitioners own words, she became the

life interest holder of the land. The order of succession under

the Third Schedule read with section 72 becomes applicable, if

the spouse fails to succeed and not otherwise. Thereafter the

petitioners cannot change that position by amending the petition

to say for the first time that Podi Hamine did not succeed to the

land. During the lifetime of Podi Hamine such a position was

not taken.

In any event, if the petitioners now state that Julis wife Podi

Hamine failed to succeed to the land, the burden is on them to

prove it. The petitioners have failed to discharge that burden.

According to section 48B(b) and (c), upon succeeding to the

land, the spouse can neither dispose of nor nominate a

successor to the land. To that extent, the spouse has only the

life interest to the land.

6

It is upon the death of the spouse, according to section 72, the

land shall devolve as prescribed in the Third Schedule to the

Ordinance.

Upon the death of Podi Hamine, the eldest surviving son of the

owner of the land was the 4th respondent. According to the

Succession Table, he shall succeed to the land.

Hence, the 1st respondent is correct in issuing the Grant in the

name of the 4th respondent.

I dismiss the application of the petitioners, but without costs.
