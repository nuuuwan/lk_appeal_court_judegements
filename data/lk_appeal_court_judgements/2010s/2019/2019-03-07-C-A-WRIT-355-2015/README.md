Decided on: 07.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner had contested the Uva Provincial Council Election

held on 20.09.2014 as a candidate of the United National Party

(UNP) for the Administrative District of Badulla and polled

18,302 preferential votes and was placed 9th in order of

preferential votes among the UNP candidates for the said

District. The UNP secured 8 seats from the Badulla District.

At the General Election held on 18.08.2015, two members from

the Uva Provincial Council for the Badulla District had been

selected as members of Parliament and therefore two vacancies

were created thereby.

The petitioner filed this application seeking mandates in the

nature of writs of prohibition, mandamus and certiorari

basically preventing the 1st respondentCommissioner of

3

Elections from declaring elected as a member of the said

Provincial Council any person other than the petitioner to fill the

first vacancy as he obtained the next highest number of votes. It

is significant to note that the reliefs sought by the petitioner are

only against the 1st respondent and no other.

The previous Bench of this Court first issued an ex parte interim

order granting that relief, but after hearing the respondents

vacated the same. Thereafter, upon nomination by the 2nd

respondentthe General Secretary of the UNP, those two

vacancies have been filled by two other candidates who have

obtained lesser number of preferential votes than the petitioner.

The law governing this limited question is admittedly embodied

in section 65(2) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of

1988, as it stood at that time.1 It reads as follows.

65(2) If the office of a member falls vacant due to death,

resignation or for any other cause, the Commissioner shall

call upon the secretary of the recognized political party or

the group leader of the independent group to which the

member vacating office belonged, to nominate within a

period to be specified by the Commissioner, a person

eligible under this Act for election as a member of that

Provincial Council, to fill such vacancy. If such secretary or

group leader nominates within the specified period an

eligible person to fill such vacancy and such nomination is

accompanied by an oath or affirmation, as the case may be,

in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution, taken and subscribed or made and

subscribed, as the case may be, by the person nominated

1 Section 65(2) was further amended by Act No. 17 of 2017.

4

to fill such vacancy, the Commissioner shall declare such

person elected as a member of that Provincial Council from

the administrative district in respect of which the vacancy

occurred.

If on the other hand, such secretary or group leader fails to

makes nomination within the specified period, the

Commissioner shall declare elected as member, from the

nomination paper submitted by that party or group for the

administrative district in respect of which the vacancy

occurred, the candidate who has secured the highest

number of preferences at the election of members to that

Provincial Council, next to the last of the members declared

elected to that Provincial Council from that party or group.

The Commissioner shall cause the name of the member as

declared elected to be published in the Gazette.

According to this section, the secretary of the political party gets

the first opportunity to nominate to the Commissioner of

Elections an eligible person (whose name appears in the original

nomination paper and who secured some preferences at the

election2) to fill such vacancy.

If there is no such nomination by the secretary of the political

party, then the Commissioner of Elections gets the next

opportunity to declare elected as a member the candidate who

secured the next highest number of preferences in the

nomination paper to fill such vacancy.

It is clear that, in that process, the secretary of the political

party has the discretion to nominate an eligible person to fill

5

such vacancy, but the Commissioner of Elections has no such

discretion.

Simply stated, the former shall not mandatorily nominate the

candidate who received the next highest number of preferences

in the nomination paper to fill such vacancy3, but, when it

comes to the latter, he has no alternative but to declare elected

as a member the candidate who secured the next highest

number of preferences in the nomination paper to fill such

vacancy.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner admits that

the party secretary under section 65(2) has the discretion in that

regard, but his contention is that the secretary shall exercise

that discretion reasonably and not capriciously.4

It is the position of the 2nd respondentParty Secretary that the

petitioner, during the Presidential Election held on 08.01.2015

and the Parliamentary Election held on 17.08.2015, supported

the opposing candidate and/or the rival party. This was

corroborated by a photograph marked P1 in the District Court

action.5 The petitioner denies this allegation. However, it is not

his position that, even if that allegation is true, he must be

nominated to fill the vacancy as the candidate who secured in

order of preferential votes the next highest number of votes.

That means, if the allegation is correct, exercising the discretion

against the petitioner is not unreasonable. These internal

disputes cannot be adjudicated in a writ application. When

Susiripala, SC Appeal Nos. 75/2010 & 55/2011 decided on 12.02.2014 (SC) 4 Vide paragraph 2.1 of the written submissions of the petitioner filed with the motion dated 03.12.2018. 5 Vide pages 13-14 of the written submissions of the petitioner tendered with the motion dated 22.10.2015.

major facts are in dispute, writ, especially mandamus, will not

lie.6

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
