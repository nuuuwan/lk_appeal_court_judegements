The Petitioner-Petitioner - On 30.10.2018 The Respondents-Respondents - On 30.10.2018

The petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to set aside the order of

the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura dated 08.05.2018, in Bail Application

No: 70/2018.

Facts of the case:

The first suspect was arrested along with two other suspects on or about

27.06.2017 with a gross quantity of 4.1g of heroin. According to the Government

Analyst's repost the pure amount of heroin is 0.298g.

The petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioner') is wife of the

first suspect and she has made an application for bail on behalf of the first suspcet

before the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura which was refused on

08.05.2018 due to lack of exceptional circumstances.

Page 3 of 9

Being aggrieved by the said refusal, the petitioner preferred a revision application

to this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted several grounds of appeal in

the petition. It is pertinent to note that the instant application is an application for

revision. In the body of the petition it is submitted as follows;

"(17) Being aggrieved by the said order dated 08.05.2018 of the Provincial

High Court of Western Province holden at Panadura, the petitioner seek to

Appeal Your Lordship's court on the following among other grounds to be

raised at the hearing of this application.

(a) Did his Lordship of the High Court error in law infailing to

access and evaluate the document submitted before the High

Court?" (Paragraph 17 of the petition)

Thereafter the petitioner sets out five more errors of law that the Learned High

Court Judge ought to have committed. However the petitioner has not prayed to

revise or to set aside the aforesaid order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

08.05.2018. Therefore we are of the view that considering the legality of the order

of the Learned High Court Judge will be pointless in the absence of a prayer to

revise the same. Any petitioner who seeks to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court should act promptly and make a proper prayer since revision is a

discretionary remedy. Further we are of the view that it was a mistake on the part

of the petitioner to aver grounds of appeal instead of exceptional circumstances.

It is mandatory to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances in an

application for revision.

In the case of Dharmatatne and another V. Palm paradise Cabanas Ltd and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal ... "

In the case of Vanic Incorporation Ltd V. Jayasekara [1997] 2 Sri L.R 365, it

was held that,

"In the case of Attorney-General v. Podi Singho (supra) Dias, J. held that

even though the revisionary powers should not be exercised in cases when

there is an appeal and was not taken, the revisionary powers should be

exercised only in exceptional circumstances such as (a) miscarriage of

justice (b) where a strong case for interference by the Supreme Court is

made out or (c) where the applicant was unaware of the order. Dias, J also

observed that the Supreme Court in exercising its powers of revision is not

hampered by technical rules of pleading and procedure ... "

In light of the above, it is understood that demonstrating the exceptional

circumstances is a pre-condition in a revision application.

Further, section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (as

amended) requires an accused or a suspect under the said Act to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of Court in order to get released on

bail.

In the case of Labynidarage Nishanthi V. Attorney General [CA (PHC) APN

48/2014], it was held that,

"It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under the above

act will be admitted to bail only in terms of section 83(1) of the said Act and

it is only on exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant

to note, the term "exceptional circumstances" has not been explained or

defined in any of the Statutes. Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding

in what creates a circumstance which is exceptional in nature.

There are plethora of cases in the legal parlor which had identified what

creates an "exceptional circumstances" in relation to granting bail ... "

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner further contended that according to Bail

Act No. 30 of 1997, grant of bail shall be regarded as the rule and refusal as

exception. However in the case of Shiyam V. OIC, Narcotics Bureau and

another (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 156, it was held that,

" ... Therefore, even if I am to agree with the submissions of the learned

President's Counsel for the appellants, yet the provisions of section 83(1) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act would be applicable and the

proper forum for making an application for bail when a person is suspected

or accused of an offence under section 54A or 54B of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Act would be the High Court where such bail would

be granted only in exceptional circumstances. The criteria therefore set out

by section 3(1) of the Bail Act for exclusions are clearly dealt with by the

provisions contained in section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 Of 1984 .. .1 hold that the provisions in the

Page 6 of 9

Bail Act would have no application to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act ... "

In the case ofW.R.Wickramasinghe V. The Attorney General [CA (PRC) APN

39/2009], it was held that,

"When Section 3 of the Bail Act is considered it is seen that the Bail Act

shall not apply to a person accused or suspected of having committed or

convicted of an offence under

1. The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No 48 of

1979,

2. Regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance, or

3. Any other written law which makes express provision in respect of

the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of having

committed, or convicted of, offences under such other written law.

It is therefore seen that when the legislature enacted the Bail Act it was not

the intention of the legislature to release each and every suspect who has

been on remandfor a period exceeding 24 months. "

Therefore it is well settled law that the principles governing bail under the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act are manifestly different from the general

principles of bail under the Bail Act.

We observe that the petitioner has submitted about an illness of a child as a ground

of revision to the High Court as well as this Court.

In the case of Cader (On behalf of Rashid Khan) V. Officer-In-Charge

Narcotics Bureau [2006] 3 Sri L.R 74, it was held that,

Page 7 of9

''Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is due administration of justice and

not primarily or solely the relevancy of grievances of a party. Revisionary

powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred due

to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only when a strong

case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice ... "

In the case of Ranil Charuka Kulathunga v. AG [CA (PHC) APN 134/2015], it

was held that,

"The petitioner submits several grounds to consider bail. The Petitioner

states that he is a married person with two school going children. The

persons getting married and having children is not an exceptional ground. It

is the normal day to day life of the people. "

The Learned High Court Judge was correct in refusing to consider the illness of the

child to be an exceptional circumstance. Further we observe that the Learned SC

for the respondent has submitted to the High Court that the first suspect has 03

previous convictions under possession of Cannabis and 08 convictions with regard

to illicit liquor. Additionally there is a pending trial of murder against the first

suspect in the High Court of Pandaura. Therefore the Learned High Court Judge, in

refusing to enlarge the suspect in bail, has considered the probability of committing

further offences by the first suspect.

In the case of Labukola Ange Wisin Gedara Ashani Dhanushshika V. Attorney

General [CA (PHC) APN 04/2016], it was held that,

"In the present case the petitioner failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances warranting this court to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

The petitioner's first point is that the suspect is in remand nearly for two

Page8of9

,

years. The intention of the legislature is to keep in remand any person who

is suspected or accused of possessing or trafficking heroin until the

conclusion of the case. The section 83(1) of the Act expresses the intention of

the legislature ... The suspect in the present case has been previously

convicted on similar offences. Therefore, remanding itself, of a person of

this caliber cannot be an exceptional circumstance to grant bail. "

Considering above, we are of the view that this application should have been

dismissed in limine due to the failure to aver exceptional circumstances in the

petition. Nevertheless we have considered even the merits of the case and we see

no reason to grant bail to the first suspect.

Therefore we affirm the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 08.05.2018

and refuse to enlarge the first suspect on bail.

This revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree,
