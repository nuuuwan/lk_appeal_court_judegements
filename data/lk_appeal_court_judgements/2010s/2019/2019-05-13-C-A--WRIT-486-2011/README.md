Respondents

Dr. Sunil Cooray with Sithara Jayasundera for the Substituted Petitioner

Anusha Samaranayake DSG for the Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

Substituted Petitioner on 05.03.2019

Respondents on 29.04.2019

Argued on: 31.01.2019

Decided on: 10.05.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner states that her land more fully described in the schedule to the petition was

acquired in terms of an order made under proviso (a) to section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act

as amended (Act) by order marked X10. However, she claims that the said land was not utilised

for the public purpose for which it was acquired and that she has not been paid any

compensation.

The Petitioner claimed the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the Respondents, or anyone or more of

them, to acquire the Petitioner's land, as more fully described in the schedule to the

Page 4 of 8

petition in terms of Government Gazette Notification No. 89/2, dated 19th May 1980,

marked as Xl0 and/or in terms of Government Gazette Notification No. 185/6 dated 23rd

March 1982, marked as Xll;

(b) A writ of mandamus directing the Respondents, or anyone or more of them to duly divest

to the Petitioner the land more fully described in the schedule to the petition in terms of

section 39A (1) of the Act forthwith and/or duly consider same in terms of the law,

Or in the alternative

(c) A writ of mandamus directing the Respondents, or anyone or more of them, to duly and

forthwith compute, make available and pay to the Petitioner the requisite compensation

in respect of the acquisition of the land owned by her, as more fully described in the

schedule to the petition by the State as aforementioned and/or duly consider same in

terms of the law.

The Respondents state that the said land is part of a larger portion of land in extent 273 Acres

and 38 Perches which was acquired for the Sri Jayewardenepura Parliamentary and

Administrative Complex and has been utilised for a public purpose namely the construction of

the Parliamentary Complex, Roads, Lake, Canal, Urban Forest park, Green Areas in the vicinity

and the Gramodaya Folk Art Centre and that the particular portion of land was filled and

developed and at present an Urban Forest Park in extent 9 Acres has been inaugurated together

with other lands acquired. It is further stated that the compensation inquiries have been held in

terms of the Act and that the Petitioner did not present any claim for compensation.

Writ of Certiorari

In Fernandopulle v. Minister of Land and Agriculture [79(11) N.L.R. 115 at 119] the legal position

applicable to the instant case was stated by the Supreme Court as follows:

"If one looks at the entire Act two main powers are given to the Minister. They

are:

1. The power to decide whether the land is required for public purpose

and to direct that it be acquired, and

Page 5 of 8

2. Whether there is an urgency compelling the immediate possession

being taken of the land and to direct that possession be taken.

As pointed out earlier, the former decision is by enactment (section 5(2)) made

conclusive and therefore removed from scrutiny by the Courts. The latter has not

been so treated and it is legitimate to hold that the legislature did not intend to

remove the Court's power of scrutiny." {emphasis added}

However, the Supreme Court held that while an order by the Minister under the proviso to

section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act can be made only in cases of urgency, it is however a

matter for a Petitioner who seeks the remedy by way of Certiorari, to satisfy the Court that

there was in fact no urgency and his application cannot succeed should he fail to do so. Hence

the burden of proof is on the Petitioner to adduce evidence that there was no urgency and if he

fails to do so, her application must be dismissed. This then is the ambit of the inquiry before this

court.

The Petitioner has not placed any evidence to show that there was no urgency which permitted

the making of an order under proviso {a} to section 38 of the Act. Hence the application for a writ

of certiorari to quash X10 must fail. In any event, the application has been made after 31 years

from the making of the said order and must fail on the ground of delay as well.

Writs of Mandamus

The first prayer seeks a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents, or anyone or more of

them to duly divest to the Petitioner the land more fully described in the schedule to the petition

in terms of section 39A {1} of the Act forthwith and/or duly consider same in terms of the law.

However, the Supreme Court in Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and Others [S.c.

Appeal No. 85/2008 & 101/2008; S.C.M. 01.06.2009] held that the exercise of discretionary

power vested with the Minister by section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act is not amenable to

judicial review in an application for a writ of mandamus.

Page 6 of 8

In any event, section 39A (2) of the Act sets out four pre-conditions that the Minister has to be

satisfied prior to making a divesting Order and in the instant matter prima facie at least two

conditions are not satisfied as there is evidence that the land has been used for a public purpose

and improvements been affected.

Hence the first prayer for a writ of mandamus must fail.

The alternative relief is for a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents, or anyone or more

of them, to duly and forthwith compute, make available and pay to the Petitioner the requisite

compensation in respect of the acquisition of the land owned by her, as more fully described in

the schedule to the petition by the State as aforementioned and/or duly consider same in terms

of the law.

The communication between the Petitioner and the public authorities clearly establishes that at

least by 25.09.1992 the Petitioner was aware that the land claimed by her has been acquired by

the State [3Rl and 3R2]. She was informed that compensation for the acquired land had been

deposited with the Government Agent, Colombo to be paid to the claimants and for her to

forward her claim to the Government Agent. She did nothing after that for twenty years.

On 28.08.2010 (SR1) the Petitioner again writes to the Divisional Secretary inquiring whether

her land has been acquired. This to me appears to ~ have been done on advice in a feeble

attempt to justify any legal proceedings that were to be launched subsequently. The Divisional

Secretary informed the Petitioner on 18.10.2010 (X17) that it has been acquired. This application

was filed on 20.07.2011 which is 29 years after the acquisition and 19 years after the public

authorities confirmed that the land in question was acquired.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena, Principal, Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 5 and 5 others

[(1986) 1 SrLL.R. 275] it was held that certiorari being a discretionary remedy will not be granted

where there was delay in seeking the remedy.

Page 7 of 8

In Jayaweera v. Asst. Cammissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R.

70] Jayasuriya J. held that" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter

of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has discretion to deny him relief having

regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief." In that case relief was refused since there was a delay of

over two and half years since making the order challenged.

In Jayarathne v. Wickremaratne and Others [(2003) 2 Sri.L.R. 276] it was held that even when the

Petitioner is entitled to the relief on grounds of error of law, the Petitioner is guilty of laches

which stands against the grant of relief by way of writ of certiorari. In this case, the Court

specifically came to a finding that the decision impugned in that application was irrational,

arbitrary and unreasonable. Yet the relief was refused since the application was made to Court 7

years after the impugned decision.

The instant case is a text book example of a situation where the discretionary relief should be

refused on delay. The learned counsel for the Substituted Petitioner sought to overcome the

difficulties faced by submitting at paragraph 5 of the written submissions that there was no

section 7 notice under the Act made in relation to the land in dispute as it is included within lot

25 of Plan No. Co 5516. However, at paragraph 14 of the petition the Petitioner states that the

land belonging to her was a smaller extent of the land described as lot No.3 depicted in plan no.

Plan No. Co 5516 which is clearly included in the section 7 notice (X11).

For the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
