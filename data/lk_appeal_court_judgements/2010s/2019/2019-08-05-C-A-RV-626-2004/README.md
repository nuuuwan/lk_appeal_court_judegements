T

he Petitioners in both CA. 63/2004 and CA. 626/2004 have filed these two

applications before this Court for restitutio in integrum and revision.

The Petitioners aver that they purchased their separate lots from one Melvin Dayananda

(the 6th Defendant-Respondent in the partition action D.C Kuliyapitiya Case No.7086/P)

out of the blocked portions that the said Dayananda had made after his own purchase of

a larger land that had belonged to the Land Reforms Commission. The Petitioners in

both applications have attached to their petitions their respective deeds of transfer along

with the Deed bearing No.1l68 that had transferred the larger land called Marylandwana

alias Kammalwaua from the Land Reforms Commission to Dayananda (6th Defendant-

Respondent). It is after this purchase from the Land Reforms Commission that the 6th

Defendant-Respondent blocked out the land into 12 lots and sold them to the

Petitioners.

The Petitioners exercised due diligence in obtaining title reports that indicated that their

vendor 6th Defendant-Respondent had valid and effectual title to the said land-caveat

5

emptor; qui ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum emit-UNo one ought in ignorance to but that

which is the right of another".

Some of the Petitioners purchased their blocks under loan schemes and thereafter they

constructed houses on the lands and their families live peaceably in their houses in the

comfortable belief and warranty that the title to their dwellings are free from any defects.

Both applications plead that their respective folios in the land registry never indicated

that any partition action had been instituted in respect of their lands.

Both petitions for revision and restitutio in integrum state that-'somewhere in January 2004,

the Petitioners came to know that the District Court of Kuliyapitiya had entered a final

partition decree in respect of a land called Delgahawatta and that this decree incorporates

the lands of the Petitioners' as well. One of the beneficiaries of the partition decree is the

4 th Defendant-Respondent and even the date for execution had been fixed. Upon

inquiries made from the District Court, the Petitioners came to know that there had been

a partition action bearing No.7086/P and the judgment in the case had been delivered on

15.05.1997. They also found that their lands had been engulfed in the corpus of the said

partition action.

It appeared that the visit of the fiscal to eject the Petitioners in consequence of the final

partition decree entered in D.C. Ku/iyapitiya 7086/P was imminent and that imminence

impelled the Petitioners to move this Court for revision and restitutio in integrum and

further steps in the District Court have since been stayed.

The plans produced in the partition action throw some light on the fact that the lands of

the Petitioners have been included as part of the corpus that was sought to be

partitioned. The preliminary plan bearing No.916 of 17.02.1986 and its report show that

the Plaintiff-Respondents were seeking to partition lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 depicted in the

said plan. The report of the surveyor R.B. Navarame dated 17.02.1986 clearly shows that

Narada Dayananda (the vendor of the Petitioners who became the 6th Defendant in the

partition suit) had been present before the surveyor and even the parties to the case

admitted before the surveyor that he had been in possession of lots which had once

6

belonged to the Land Reforms Commission. In other words the fact that Lots No.1 and 2

in the preliminary plan bearing No.916 should be excluded from the corpus sought to be

partitioned is quite clear from the surveyor's report. Lots 1 and 2 in Plan No.916 are lands

that LRC had sold to Narada Dayananda (6th Defendant-Respondent) who in turn

blocked and sold them to the Petitioners. I must state that this aspect of the matter had

gone begging and the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya failed to bring his mind to bear

upon this aspect of the report in his imperative duty to investigate title.

Let me turn to the background in which the partition action had proceeded in the

District Court

The survey plans bearing 1711 of Marylandwatte and Plans 916 and 1398 in the

partition Action

a. The Plaintiff-Respondent instituted this partition action on 04.08.1983 against the

1st to 6th Defendant-Respondents in respect of Ddgahawatte also known as

Thiriwannagalagodahena which is the adjOining land to the Marylandwarra. As

evidence from the folios discloses no lis pendens had been registered in respect of

Marylandwarra.

b. The preliminary survey had been done by R.B. Navarathna, Licensed Surveyor. The

preliminary survey plan was numbered 916 and is dated 17.02.1986. Thereafter a

superimposition was done by superimposing Plan No.1711 of Surveyor Y.M.A. Yapa

(being the survey plan of that part of Marylandwarre) upon Plan No.916. The plan

containing the superimposition was marked as Xl in the District Court. The

report thereon has been appended as X.

c. In the report the surveyor has clearly indicated that Lot lB and 2B of the plan

bearing No.1398 and dated 03.12.1987 is part of the land depicted in Plan No.l7ll

prepared by Y. M.A. Yapa licensed surveyor (called Marylandwarre).

7

d. The total extent of Lot 1B and 2B in Plan 1398 is 1 acre 0 roods and 17 perches the

exact extent of that part of Marylandwatte originally purchased by Dayananda from

the Land Reform Commission.

e. As such Court ought to have excluded Lots 1B and 2B from the partition action,

but it failed to do so.

The Plaintiff-Respondent cannot plead ignorance of the fact that the corpus contained a

land named Marylandwatte for which no lis pendens had been registered at the Kurunegala.

The trial and judgment in the District Court

On the 10.06.1996 when the above matter came up for trial the Counsel for the 4 th

Defendant-Respondent informed the court that he had sold his share and was not

staking claim in respect of the land. However on 12.09.1996 the Counsel for the

4thDefendant-Respondent informed court that he had not sold his share whereupon the

learned District Judge vacated the earlier evidence and commenced trial afresh.

When the trial commenced on 12.09.1996 the Plaintiff testified to the effect that the

surveyor Navaratne prepared Plan 1398 (the Plan marked as Xl and the Report marked as

Y1) in order to secure the exclusion of the land belonging to the Land Reform

Commission. He had in evidence inadvertently stated that only Lot lA needed to be

excluded. However if the learned District Judge had examined the surveyor's report it

would have become evident that not only Lot lA but also Lot 1B and 2B should have been

excluded as the land belonging to the Land Reform Commission.

When the 4th Defendant gave evidence he clearly stated that he was entitled to l/5th of

corpus,

In the judgment dated 15.05.1997 the learned District Judge while holding that Plan 1398

was prepared in order to exclude the land of the Land Reform Commission merely acted

on the Plaintiff's evidence and excluded only Lot lA without examining the report of

surveyor Navaratne which clearly indicated that Lots 1B and 2B were also lands

contained in Plan 17811 (i.e., LRC land), which had to be excluded.

8

The learned District Judge also held that the 4th Defendant was entitled to 22495 of

58896 shares of the land, when both in the statement of claim and his evidence the 4th

Defendant has staked a claim only in respect of a V5th share of the land.

According to the said final decree the 4th Defendant-Respondent had been allotted Lot

No.1 of preliminary plan bearing NO.916 made by R.B. Navarame licensed Surveyor. It

has been brought home to the notice of this Court in this application that the said Lot

No.1 contains the land named Marylandwatte which belongs to the Respondents.

On 05.01.2004 a writ of execution came to be issued in favour of the 4th Defendant-

Respondent.

There is no doubt that the plan that arose out of the superimposition namely 1398 clearly

shows that Lot lB and Lot 2B must have been excluded from the corpus sought to be

partitioned. The corpus included the land belonging to LRC which is known as

Marylandwatte. In addition to Lot lA, Lot lB and 2B must have been excluded.

It is quite clear that the corpus was a larger land and there was no lis pendens that was

registered for the Marylandwatte. The purpose in registering lis pendens is twofold: firstly,

that all parties who have registered documents may have notice of the action; and,

secondly, that intending purchasers of undivided shares may be made aware of the

partition action that is pending. There is every possibility that without such lis pendens,

the Petitioners were ignorant of the partition suit and purchased their lands and built

their houses thereon. The extracts of the folios have been appended to the applications

and they clearly indicate that no lis pendens had been registered in relation to

Marylandwatte. In other words the Petitioners had not been put on notice of the fact that

the parcels of land that they had purchased were incorporated into the corpus of the

partition action.

The genuineness of the claims of the Petitioners is brought out by the final plan. The

report of the surveyor who prepared the final plan bearing NO.3616 disclose that there are

newly built houses in Lot 1 of the survey plan.

9

The statements of objections filed by the chairman of the Land Reform Commission, the

Plaintiff-Respondent and 6th Defendant-Respondent confirm that the Petitioners

secured their title from the Land Reform Commission and accordingly the lands

belonging to the Petitioners must have been excluded.

From the foregoing it is clear that whilst the report of the surveyor clearly showed that

Lots lB and 2B were parts of the plan bearing No.l711, the learned District Judge merely

looked at the evidence of the Plaintiff and excluded only Lot A.

In my view the learned Disttict Judge had acted mechanically and routinely. He had been

oblivious to the obvious facts and in view of the material that has emerged in this

application, it becomes incumbent upon the learned District Judge to ask the question as

to how people (not disclosed in the plaint) could reside on the land if they did not have

interest in the soil or the land.

The learned Disttict Judge had excluded from consideration facts evidenced by the

preliminary plan bearing No.966 and the plan that arose out of the superimposition. The

reports of the surveyor speak volumes of the interests of others in the land that had been

incorporated into the corpus. If the learned Disttict Judge had given the utmost

consideration to the plans and reports, he would have seen Lots lB and 2B would not

belong to the Plaintiff or the 4th Defendant-Respondent.

It is trite law that if the title of the parties had not been investigated, the Court of Appeal

or the Supreme Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction would set aside the

judgment of the District Court even on the application of a person who has not even

been a party to the action and had even been absent from the Court on the trial date-see

Kannangara v. Silva 35 N.L.R 01. In this case the Supreme Court directed the District

Court to hold the trial de novo and investigate title.

So I would set aside the judgment and decree entered in this case and direct the learned

District Judge to conduct a trial de novo and the Petitioners should be added and

permitted to file their statements of claim. All proceedings had so far in this case are all

invalidated.

10

This judgment would also be applicable in full force to the connected application CA.

Application No.63/2004. The same orders I have made in this application are made in

CA. Application No.63/2004.

Thus I allow both these two applications namely CA. Application No.63/2004 and

Application No.626/2004
