01. This is an Application filed by the Petitioner to get the order made by the

learned High Court Judge ofNegombo dated 05.04.2019, refusing bail to the

Petitioner, revised.

02. Heard both counsel for the Petitioner as well as the Respondent.

03. The Petitioner had been originally charged in the High Court of Negombo

under case No. HC 6512002 for the offences under the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Act. The quantity of the Dangerous drugs involved, had

been 5605.3 grams. By their lordships order dated 19.12.2003, the Petitioner

was enlarged on bail by the Court of Appeal in case No. CA (PHC) APN

55/2003.

04. After trial, the Petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the learned High

Court Judge of Negombo, against which the Petitioner appealed to this

court.

05. Court of Appeal in case No. CA 87/2017, set aside the above judgment of

the learned High Court judge dated 30.03.2017, and sent the case back to the

High court for retrial.

06. When the case was called in the High Court ofNegombo on 05.04.2019, the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal was read over to the Petitioner and fixed

the case for trial on 23.07.2019. On the sarne day (05.04.2019), the learned

High Court Judge refusing the application of the counsel for the Petitioner to

release the Petitioner on bail, has remanded the Accused.

07. As submitted by the counsel for the Petitioner, it is pertinent to note that,

when this court in case No. CA 87/2017, set aside the conviction of the

learned High Court Judge dated 30.03.2017, their lordships had clearly

stated that the learned High Court Judge may consider that the Appellant

3

was already enlarged on bail, on the order of the Court of Appeal, when this

case is mentioned in the High Court.

08. The learned High Court Judge has given his reasons for refusing bail, where

he stated that, the Petitioner has failed to submit exceptional circumstances

to grant bail. Further he has stated that, he takes into consideration the

quantity of the dangerous drugs involved and the prescribed punishment the

Petitioner would get, if convicted.

09. However, we find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

that the Petitioner was already on bail ordered by this court, and the fact that

the conviction was set aside and retrial has been ordered.

10. Although, in their lordships judgment dated 05.03.2019 of court of Appeal

Case No. 87/2017 the learned High Court Judge was directed that he may

consider that the Appellant was already enlarged on bail by this court, there

is no mention in the order of the learned High Court Judge that he has taken

that into consideration.

II . Considering that this court has already enlarged the Petitioner on bail and

that the conviction had been set aside, we order that the Petitioner be

enlarged on the same bail conditions imposed on him on 19.02.2003 in the

Court of Appeal in case No. CA PHC APN 55/2003. However following

additional bail conditions are ordered by this court.

Two additional sureties in a sum of Rupees Five Million (Rs.

5,000,0001=) each (surety bail), acceptable to the learned High Court

Judge.

The Petitioner should not leave the island without the permission of

the learned High Court Judge. His travel documents to be handed over

to the High Court Registry (if it is not already handed over to the

Court).

4

This travel ban to be conveyed to the relevant immigration authorities

by the High Court.

Rest of the bail conditions imposed by this court on 19.12.2003 will

remain unchanged.

Revision Application is allowed.
