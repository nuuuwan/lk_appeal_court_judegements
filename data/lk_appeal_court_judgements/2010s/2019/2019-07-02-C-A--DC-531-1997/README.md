DEFENDANT~RESPONDENTS

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

Kamaran Aziz with Eshan Ariyaratne for the

Plaintiff~ Appellant Respondent absent and unrepresented

28.08.2018

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

The Plaintiff~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

action against the Defendant~Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Defendants"), by a Plaint, dated 26.06.1992, praying for inter~alia the following

substantive relief, to wit~

a. judgment and Decree in sum Rs.SOS, 68S/~ against the Defendants jointly and/or

severally;

b. an Order for the recovery of the vehicle concerned.

The Defendants thereafter tendered their joint Answer, dated 28.01.1994, and prayed inter

alia for the dismissal of the Plaintiff's action.

It has to be observed at the outset that the Defendants had neither pleaded specifically a

denial of the jurisdiction of Court (as required in terms of Section 76 of the Civil

Procedure Code), nor was an issue raised on the question of jurisdiction. Neither was the

termination of the lease agreement denied by the Defendants.

The only salient contention made by the Defendants in their said answer was that the

Agreement concerned was not executed within the territorial jurisdiction of the District

Court of Colombo.

The learned trial Judge thereafter delivered judgment on 31.01.1997, dismissing the action

of the Plaintiff, on the ground that Court had no jurisdiction since the Agreement

concerned had been entered into beyond the territorial jurisdiction of District Court of

Kandy (i.e. executed in Colombo).

In terms of the Section 76 of the Civil Procedure Code, and a slew of authorities, it is

clear that if a Defendant seeks to traverse jurisdiction, it should be pleaded in the

Answer by way of a specific denial, as otherwise the Defendant is deemed to have

accepted jurisdiction.

According to the terms of the answer, the Defendants have not traversed jurisdiction as

required in terms of the law, and have merely pleaded that the Lease Agreement 3

concerned was executed beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Thus it was submitted by

the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff~Appellant that the learned District Judge dismissing

the Plaintiff's action based on want of jurisdiction is misconceived in law.

In any event, in terms of Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, jurisdiction can be

founded on the residence of the Defendant, where the contract was executed and/or

where the cause of action arose.

It was pointed out that the Plaintiff had specifically prayed for the return of the vehicle

concerned in terms of Prayer (b) to the Plaint.

Clause 21 of the Lease Agreement reads thus: ~

"Upon the expiration or early termination of this lease hereby created for any reason whatsoever

the lessee shall deliver and surrender up property in the condition in which it was received by the

lessee, fair wear and tear excepted, to lessee at the address of the lessor stated in the lease

agreement"

The address of the Lessor (the Plaintiff) stated in the Lease Agreement is No.85, Raja

Veediya, Kandy.

Therefore the learned Counsel argued that the cause of action (the return of the vehicle

concerned) arose in Kandy, being within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court

of Kandy.

Hence, the Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the learned trial Judge had grievously

erred in dismissing the Plaintiff's action on the basis of want of jurisdiction.

On the basis of such error of law, can this court now exercise jurisdiction to accept

and hear this appeal notwithstanding the fact that the notice of appeal was belated?

Section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code:~

"The Court of Appeal may, of its own motion or on any application made, call for and examine the

record of any case, whether already tried or pending trial, in any court, tribunal or other

institution for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any judgment or

4

order passed therein, or as to the regularity of the proceedings of such court, tribunal or other

institution, and may upon revision of the case brought before it pass any judgment or make any

order thereon, as the interests ofjustice may require."

Article 138(1) of the Constitution:~

"The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of

any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be 98

[committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any

Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of

appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance tribunal or other institution may have

taken cognizance"

Article 14S of the Constitution:~

"The Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or on any application made, call for, inspect and

examine any record of any Court of First Instance and in the exercise of its revisionary powers

may make any order thereon as the interests ofjustice may require."

The aforesaid provisions were advanced by learned Counsel Mr. Kamran Aziz in order to

drive home the wide amplitude of powers that this Court possesses to exercise

revisionary jurisdiction to rectify errors of fact and law. The question that was urged by

Mr. Kamran Aziz the learned Counsel was that even though there is no proper appeal

before this Court owing to the fact that the notice of appeal was out of time, this Court

must exercise its revisionary jurisdiction.

There is no gainsaying that revision lies even when the appeal has abated. Even when an

appeal fails, this Court can exercise revisionary jurisdiction provided the overarching

consideration of a manifest errors is demonstrated in the proceedings of the court a quo.

A look~back on the case law repays attention.

5

It is axiomatic that the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is available to rectify

manifest error or perversity. This principle was adverted to by this Court in

Chandraguptha v. Gunadasa Suwandaratne C.A.L.A 508/2005 (CA minutes of

12.09.2017). In Sinnathangam v. Meeramohaideen 60 N.L.R 394~T.S.Femando, J. (with

Weerasooriya, J. agreeing) opined that the Court possesses the power to set right, in

revision, an erroneous decision in an appropriate case even though an appeal has abated

on the ground of non~compliance with technical requirements. Jayawickrama, J. (with

De Silva, J. agreeing) followed Sinnathangam v. Meeramohaideen (supra)in Soysa v.

Silva and Others (2000) 2 Sri L.R 235 and considered the case of a revision application

that had been filed in the Court of Appeal lO years after the pronouncement of the

judgment in the District Court. In fact the appeal filed against the said judgment had

failed in the Court of Appeal on a technicality namely the appellant had signed the notice

of appeal on his own when there was a registered Attorney on record. The appeal was

rejected as it was preferred contrary to Section 754 of the Civil Procedure Code. Not to

be outdone, the appellant in the case preferred a revisionary application. The argument

was raised that the petitioner could not move by way of revision after the appeal was

rejected by the Court of Appeal. The revisionary application was also resisted on the

ground of long delay in that it was after a lapse of lO years from the pronouncement of

the judgment that the petitioner moved by way of revision. It was in those circumstances

that this Court observed that the power given to a superior court by way of revision is

wide enough to give it the right to revise any order made by an original court. Its object is

the due administration of justice and the correction of errors sometimes committed by

the Court itself in order to avoid miscarriage of justice.

Revisionary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 138 of the Constitution is

untrammeled by delay in its invocation provided there is irreparable damage, miscarriage

of justice or perversity in the judgment of the court a quo.

The underlying theory behind revisionary jurisdiction is that there must be a manifest

error~see Saheeda Umma and Another v. Hanilla (1999) 1 Sri L.R 150 whereinJ.A.N. de

6

Silva, J. (as His Lordship then was) held that the Court of Appeal should act in revision,

when there is a grave irregularity or a miscarriage of justice, even in a case where

revisionary powers have not been invoked by the Petitioner. In my view this case merits

intervention by revision and restitution-the two extraordinary remedies bestowed on

this Court by virtue of Article 138 of the Constitution. It is trite that in applications for

revision, there must be circumstances that shock the conscience of court- Wijesinghe v.

Tharmaratnam IV Sri L.R 47.

In the case of L.R Finance Com v. MK. WalJjsinghe and Others (CA 191/2007 (F) CA

Minutes dated 27.l0.2011) it was held:-

"In all the above circumstances I have taken the view that the Appellant has no right of appeal.

Nevertheless this is a fit and proper case to exercise revisionary powers of this court. Due

administration ofjustice requires this court to interfere by way of revisionary powers."

Though I concur with the submissions of the learned Counsel that the Court will not shy

away from exercising its revisionary jurisdiction-a proposition which is rooted in

common sense and natural justice, I would bear in mind that there must be a perverse or

manifest error in the judgment as a threshold. There must be present in the judgment or

the case circumstances that must shock the conscience of Court. I do not observe such a

manifest error in the judgment dated 31.01.l997.

Upon a careful consideration of the evidence I find that on the day on which the notice of

termination was sent, there had been no default of payment by the Defendants. It would

appear that there was no cause of action to institute this action since the notice of

termination was not founded on breach. Even at the time when the notice was

dispatched, there is evidence that payment was being made on installments.

In the circumstances I would hold that even in the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction,

the judgment of the District Court of Kandy cannot be faulted and I affirm the judgment

dated 3l.01.l997 and decline to set aside the judgment.
