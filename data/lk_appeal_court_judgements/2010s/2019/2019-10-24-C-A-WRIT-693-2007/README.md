Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

After the inquiry, the Director of Customs, forfeited a sum of Rs.

100,000/= from the Shipping Agent, and also forfeited the goods,

which are 25 containers of sugar under section 27 of the Customs Ordinance as

the same are not manifested.1

1 Vide order at page 6 of R2.

The Shipping Agent did not challenge this order, and paid the penalty.

The Petitioner filed this application against the Superintendent of

Customs, the Director of Customs and the Director General of

Customs (hereinafter the Respondent) seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari the order of forfeiture as manifested in the letter

marked P17 sent by the Respondent to the then Attorney-at-Law of

the Petitioner.

P17 reads as follows:

I write with reference to your letter dated 13th July 2007 addressed to Director General

of Customs and to consider whether there should be any meaningless response to your

letter, could you please inform your client to explain me through you, that on what

method that he (your client) retained the title of the goods, after having shipped the same

goods to Sri Lanka by vessel M/V Faith/Sinar Lombok berthed at Port of Colombo

on or around 17.01.2007. However Sri Lanka Customs dealt only with the goods of

which were unladen violating section 27 of the Customs Ordinance inter alia and not

with the titles, and for that reason as your client has no locus standi and was not

summoned for the Customs inquiry.

Section 27 of the Customs Ordinance reads as follows:

And whereas it is expedient that the officers of customs should have full cognizance of

all ships coming into any port or place in Sri Lanka, or approaching the coast thereof,

and of all goods on board or which may have been on board such ships, and also of all

goods unladen from any ships in any port or place in Sri Lanka:

It is enacted that no goods shall be unladen from any ship arriving from parts beyond

the seas at any port or place in Sri Lanka, nor shall bulk be broken after the arrival

of such ship within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka, before due report of such ship

and sufferance granted, in manner hereinafter directed; and that no goods shall be so

unladen except at such times and places and in such manner and by such persons and

4

under the care of such officers as hereinafter directed; and that all goods not duly

reported, or which shall be unladen contrary hereto, shall be forfeited; and if bulk be

broken contrary hereto the master of such ship shall forfeit a sum not exceeding one

hundred thousand rupees; and if after the arrival of any ship within the territorial

waters of Sri Lanka any alteration be made in the stowage of the cargo of such ship so

as to facilitate the unlading of any part of such cargo, or if any part be staved, destroyed,

or thrown overboard, or any package be opened, such ship shall be deemed to have

broken bulk;

Provided always that coin, bullion, cattle, and other livestock, and passengers with their

baggage, may be landed previous to report, entry or sufferance.

Admittedly, the Petitioner was not summoned for the Customs

inquiry, as it is the position of the Respondent that, proved violation

of section 27 of the Customs Ordinance results in forfeiture of the

goods by operation of law. Vide Bhambra v. Director General of Customs

[2002] 3 Sri LR 401.

This position is disputed by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner on two main grounds: (a) section 27 is inapplicable in the

facts of this case, and (b) forfeiture is not automatic, but shall

necessarily be after a hearing.

The learned Presidents Counsel admits that whether section 27 was

applicable is a matter that must be determined at the inquiry. The Respondents

cannot invoke section 27 before deciding whether section 27 applies. Before

deciding whether section 27 applies the Petitioner must be given a hearing.2 That

means, the applicability or inapplicability of section 27 is not a pure

question of law, but a mixed question of fact and law, and therefore,

such disputed matters cannot be decided in this writ application.

2 Vide page 15 of the written submissions of the Petitioner dated 03.12.2018.

5

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner is that the decision of the Respondent to forfeit the goods

shall be quashed by certiorari, as the said decision was made, without

giving the Petitioner, being the owner of the goods, a hearing, in

violation of the fundamental rule of natural justiceaudi alteram partem.

The learned Presidents Counsel states that it was decided in Manawadu

v. The Attorney General [1987] 2 Sri LR 30 that the owner of the goods has to

be given a hearing and goods cannot be forfeited without affording the owner a

hearing.3

This argument is based on the (wrong) premise that the Respondent

admits that the Petitioner is the owner of the goods, whereas it is not.

Vide P17, which I quoted above, and paragraph 3 of the statement of

objections of the Respondent whereby the Respondent

disputes/denies/does not admit that the Petitioner is the owner of the

goods.

Such contentious matters, cannot be decided in a writ Court, and that

shall be decided by a District Court.

In the District Court, the burden is on the Petitioner to prove that he

is the owner of the goods. Vide Attorney General v. Sathasivam (1966) 69

NLR 110.

Section 154 of the Customs Ordinance sets out the procedure to be

followed when claiming forfeited goods. That section runs as follows:

3 Vide page 16 of the said written submissions.

6

154(1) All ships, boats, goods, and other things which shall have been or shall

hereafter be seized as forfeited under this Ordinance, shall be deemed and taken to be

condemned, and may be dealt with in the manner directed by law in respect to ships,

boats, goods, and other things seized and condemned for breach of such Ordinance,

unless the person from whom such ships, boats, goods and other things shall have been

seized, or the owner of them, or some person authorized by him, shall, within one

month from the date of seizure of the same, give notice in writing to the Collector or

other chief officer of customs at the nearest port that he intends to enter a claim to the

ship, boat, goods, or other things seized as aforesaid, and shall further give cash security

to prosecute such claim before the court having jurisdiction to entertain the same and

otherwise to satisfy the judgment of the court and to pay costs in such sum as the

Collector or proper officer of customs at the port where or nearest to which the seizure

was made shall consider sufficient.

If proceedings for the recovery of the ship, boat, goods or other things so claimed be not

instituted in the proper court within thirty days from the date of notice and security as

aforesaid, the ship, boat, goods, or other things seized shall be deemed to be forfeited,

and shall be dealt with accordingly by the Collector or other proper officer of customs.

(2) If after the institution of proceedings in the proper court, the claimant shall give cash

security to restore the things seized or their value in such sum as the Collector or proper

officer of customs at the port where or nearest to which the seizure made shall consider

sufficient, the ship, boat, goods or other things seized may, if required, be delivered up to

the claimant at the discretion of the Principal Collector of Customs or a Deputy

Collector of Customs.

(3) After institution of proceedings in the proper court in respect of any ships, boats,

goods or other things the court, may, on the application of the Director-General of

Customs and if the claimants do not object thereto, authorise such Director-General to

dispose of such ships, boats, goods or other things and deposit the proceeds of sale in

court. Where the claimants object to the disposal of such ships, boats, goods or other

things the court may require the claimants to deposit cash security, equal to the market

value (as assessed by such Director-General) of such ships, boats, goods or other things,

in court.

By looking at section 154(1), it is clear that, even the owner of

goods is caught up or covered by that section. That means, even if

the Petitioner is the owner of the goods in question, he ought to claim

the forfeited goods, by filing an action in the District Court.

In reference to section 154, the learned Presidents Counsel states that

if the owner is not given notice of the inquiry and therefore is unaware when the

goods are forfeited, then the owner cannot have recourse to the procedure section

154(1) within the time periods stipulated therein. Therefore, when an inquiry is

held contrary to the rules of natural justice without any notice whatsoever to the

owner of the goods, the only remedy available to the owner of the goods is to file a

writ application as the procedure in section 154 cannot be invoked in such a

case.4

I regret my inability to agree with that argument, especially, in view of

the facts of this case. As seen from P18, the Petitioner did in fact give

Notice to the Respondent in terms of section 154 of the Customs

Ordinance to file a case in the District Court to recover the goods

forfeited by the Respondent. P18 Notice was given by the then

Attorney-at-Law of the Petitioner to the Respondent within the

stipulated time. P18 inter alia states:

You are hereby informed that my client intends to file action against you under section

154 of the Customs Ordinance in the DC of Colombo for the recovery of 675 metric

tons of sugar (25 containers) given in B/L Nos. EISU 360600100149 (15

containers) and EISU 360600100131 (10 containers) belonging to my client which

were forfeited at the Customs inquiry bearing the abovementioned Customs case

number.

4 Vide page 17 of the said written submissions.

8

However, it appears to me that, thereafter, the Petitioner has not

pursued that course of action, and instead, filed this writ application

to achieve the same objective.

P18 is dated 23.07.2007, and this writ application is dated 31.07.2007.

When the Customs Ordinance itself specially provides for a remedy to

address the grievance of the Petitioner, the Petitioner cannot come

before this Court by way of a writ application seeking the same relief.

Vide Ishak v. Luxman Perera, Director General of Customs [2003] 3 Sri LR

18, Bhambra v. Director General of Customs [2002] 3 Sri LR 401.

In the former case, Tilakawardena J. at page 23 held that:

Applying the provisions of Section 154 of the Customs Ordinance it is clear that there is

an existent remedy provided in terms of the aforesaid section in the District Court of

competent civil jurisdiction. This was followed in several cases: (Fernando v Dharmasiri

72 NLR 320, Gunasekera v Weerakoon 73 NLR 262, Rodrigo v The Municipal

Council, Galle 49 NLR 89, Samarakoon v Tikiribanda 51 NLR 259). In other

words where there was an alternative remedy that was adequate for the adjudication of the

matter that was being challenged by the aggrieved party except under exceptional

circumstances this Court would not invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Court.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner

but without costs.
