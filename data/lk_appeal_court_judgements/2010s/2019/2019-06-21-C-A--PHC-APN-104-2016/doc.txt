Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this revision application from the order of the

learned High Court Judge of Galle dated 20.05.2016 whereby the

application of the petitioner for writ of certiorari to quash the

arbitration award and the appeal decision made thereon was

dismissed in limine even without issuing notice on the

respondents. This the learned High Court Judge has done on two

grounds.

1. In the exercise of writ jurisdiction the Court cannot look into

the merits of the application.

2. The petitioner has not acted with uberrima fides.

I am unable to agree with both grounds.

Let me first take the first ground.

There is a misconception that even if an administrative or judicial

decision is patently erroneous, writ of certiorari does not lie, if the

decision-making process was flawless, and the deciding authority

has erred on facts and not on law. Accordingly, it is thought that,

error on facts by the decision maker, however much it is obvious,

is not a ground to quash the decision by certiorari.

I must straightaway state that error of law on the face of the

record, which is a well-accepted ground for certiorari, can be

made use of to quash erroneous administrative or judicial

decisions notwithstanding the decision-making process was

flawless. For example, if the deciding authority has manifestly

failed to properly evaluate the evidence led before him, the decision

can be quashed on the ground of error of law on the face of the

record.

3

It is important to understand that an error of fact can also be an

error of law.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v. Nestle

Lanka Limited1 Jayasuriya J. explained:

In R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunalex

parte Shaw 1951 1 KB 711 (Affirmed in 1952 1 KB 338), the

Divisional Court of the Kings Bench Division held that

certiorari would issue to quash the decision of a statutory

administration tribunal for an error of law on the face of the

record, even though that tribunal was not a court of record

and although that error did not go to the jurisdiction of the

tribunal. This decision pronounced by Lord Denning appeased

at least to a certain extent, the public demand for better justice

in the welfare state and it marked the commencement of a

new era of judicial review.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union case

(supra) the petitioner sought to quash the award made by the

arbitrator wherein he has held that the termination was justifiable.

Quashing the award by way of certiorari on the ground that there

was an error on the face of the record this Court held that:

1. Although Arbitrator does not exercise judicial power in the

strict sense, it is his duty to act judicially, though

ultimately he makes an award as may appear to him to be

just and equitable.

2. There is no evidence or material which could support the

findings reached by the Arbitrator, findings and decisions

1 [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 at 350

4

unsupported by evidence are capricious, unreasonable or

arbitrary.

3. A deciding authority which has made a finding of primary

fact wholly unsupported by evidence or which has drawn

an inference wholly unsupported by any of the primary

facts found by it will be held to have erred in point of law.

4. No evidence rule does not contemplate a total lack of

evidence it is equally applicable where the evidence taken

as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the

finding or decision.

Referring to Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunalex

parte Shaw case (supra), in Hayleys Ltd. v. Crossette-Thambiah2, it

was stated that:

In the Northumberland case (1951) 1 K.B. 721, affirmed in

(1952) 1 K. B. 338 C.A., the King's Bench Division held, for the

first time, that the Writ of Certiorari would issue to quash the

decision of a statutory administrative tribunal, for error of law

on the face of the record, although such a tribunal was not a

court of record and although the error did not go to the

jurisdiction of the tribunal. This decision may be regarded as

a landmark in the development of administrative law, and it

has already led to a modest extension of the scope of judicial

review both in England and in other common law jurisdictions.

(See Judicial Review of Administrative Action by S. A. de

Smith (Stevens) p. 295.)

Accordingly, in Hayleys Ltd. case (supra) it was held:

2 (1961) 63 NLR 248 at 257

Certiorari may be granted not only when an inferior tribunal

has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, but also in

the case of a speaking order, when an error of law appears

on the face of the record or when the tribunal bases its

decision on extraneous considerations which it ought not to

have taken into account.

In Collettes Ltd. v. Bank of Ceylon3, a Divisional Bench of the

Supreme Court held that Where there is or is not evidence to

support a finding, is a question of law. It was also held in the

same case that Given the primary facts, the question whether the

tribunal rightly exercised its discretion is a question of law.

It was held in Sithamparanathan v. People's Bank4 that Failure to

properly evaluate evidence or to take into account relevant

considerations in such evaluation is a question of law.

A similar conclusion was reached in Fonseka v. Candappa5 where

it was decided that:

It becomes a question of law where relevant evidence bearing

on a fact has not been considered or irrelevant matters have

been given undue importance or the conclusions rest mainly

on erroneous considerations or is not supported by sufficient

evidence.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour6 where the order

of the Commissioner of Labour was sought to be quashed by way

of certiorari, the Supreme Court held that:

3 [1982] 2 Sri LR 514 4 [1989] 1 Sri LR 124 5 [1988] 2 Sri LR 11 6 (1978) 79(2) NLR 409 at 426

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While

engaged on a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from the

rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions

or may take into account matters which it was not directed to

take into account. Thereby it would step outside its

jurisdiction. A tribunal which has made findings of fact

wholly unsupported by evidence or which it has drawn

inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts found by it

will be held to have erred in point of law. The concept of error

of law includes the giving of reasons that are bad in law or

inconsistent, unintelligible or it would seem substantially

inadequate. It includes also the application of a wrong legal

test to the facts found taking irrelevant considerations into

account and arriving at a conclusion without any supporting

evidence. If reasons are given and these disclose that an

erroneous legal approach has been followed the superior

Court can set the decision aside by certiorari for error of law

on the face of the record. If the grounds or reasons stated

disclose a clearly erroneous legal approach the decision will

be quashed. An error of law may also be held to be apparent

on the face of the record if the inferences and decisions

reached by the tribunal in any given case are such as no

reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law

applicable to the case could have made.

In Health & Co (Ceylon) Ltd v. Kariyawasam7 the decision of the

arbitrator was quashed by way of certiorari on the basis that:

No reasonable man could have...reached that conclusion on

the evidence placed before him. The finding here is so

7 (1968) 71 NLR 382 at 384

7

completely contrary to the weight of evidence that one can

only describe it as perverse.

Conclusion was similar in Wijerama v. Paul8 where the decision

was quashed by certiorari inter alia on the premise that:

A tribunal which draws an inference wholly unsupported by

the primary facts errs in point of law.

In Virakesari Ltd v. Fernando9 is yet another case where an

application for certiorari was allowed inter alia when it was found

that:

The omission of the first respondent to take into consideration

the evidence touching the charge of having instigated a go-

slow is....a misdirection amounting to an error of law on the

face of the record.

In Mudanayake v. Sivagnanasunderam10 the decision was not

allowed to stand as it was the opinion of the Court that:

Certiorari lies not only where the inferior Court has acted

without or in excess of its jurisdiction but also where the

inferior Court has stated on the face of the order the grounds

on which it had made it and it appears that in law those

grounds are not such as to warrant the decision to which it

had come.

In Chas Hayley and Co. Ltd., v. Commercial and Industrial

Workers11 Senanayake J. held that:

8 (1973) 76 NLR 241 at 258 9 (1963) 66 NLR 145 at 150-151 10 (1951) 53 NLR 25 at 31 11 [1995] 2 Sri LR 42 at 49-50

It is well settled that the order of an inferior tribunal having a

duty to act reasonably in determining the rights of the parties

is liable to be quashed by Writ of Certiorari for an error of law

appearing on the face of the record. A finding of fact may be

impugned on the ground of error of law on the face of the

record (a) erroneously refusing to admit admissible material

evidence (b) erroneously admitting inadmissible evidence

which influence the finding (c) finding of based on no evidence

(d) where the tribunal had acted with manifest or clear

unreasonableness or unfairness. The misconstruction of the

document becomes an error on the face of the record.

I am of the view that the Arbitrator had misconstrued the

document R16b when he failed to consider that the loss

depicted in the Report and speculated on the fact that it was

temporary without any evidence. There was no evidence for

such a finding. This was unreasonable and unfair. The

evidence revealed that the employees were getting a higher

wage than prescribed by the Wages Board Ordinance. They

were paid more than the other competitors in the Trade. The

Arbitrator failed to consider the heavy financial loss and had

acted unreasonably and unfairly in granting 30 percent

increase in wages with a 10% increase in productivity was an

error of law on the face of the record. In the circumstances, I

quash the award of the 2nd Respondent by granting a writ of

Certiorari.

The term an error of law on the face of the record was given a

broader meaning in Gunadasa v. Attorney-General12 in the

following manner:

12 [1989] 2 Sri LR 130

9

That the failure to give the petitioner a fair opportunity to

correct or contradict the material witnesses when they gave

evidence, has occasioned a violation of the principles of

natural justice; that a man's defence must always be fairly

heard. The non-observance of the said principles of natural

justice, would consequently amount to an error on the face of

the record, which would attract the remedy of Writ of

Certiorari.

The failure to make available the documents relevant to the

defence of the petitioner, at the hearing, amounted to an error

on the face of the record, and the Writ of Certiorari would lie in

such situations also.

It is on the aforesaid basis I state that the view taken by the

learned High Court Judge that in the exercise of writ jurisdiction

the Court cannot look into the merits of the application is

untenable.

It is not the task of this Court to consider whether the arbitration

award and its appeal decision are correct. The task of this Court,

at this juncture, is to consider the correctness of the impugned

order of the High Court.

Let me now consider the second ground on which the petitioners

application was dismissed in limine. That is on the premise that

the petitioner failed to act with uberrima fides. This the learned

High Court Judge says on the basis that, it appears to him, the

petitioner has agreed to the decision taken after the inquiry

regarding shortage of goods. (

,

.

10

.) The High Court Judge is not

certain of what he says. He says, it appears to him that the

petitioner has accepted the decision. He does not say where and

when the petitioner has accepted the decision. If the petitioner has

accepted the decision taken after the inquiry, there is no case for

the petitioner, and if it so, in my view, it is obligatory on the part of

the learned High Court Judge to have exactly pointed it out in the

order the place where he has accepted the decision, for the benefit

of the petitioner and the Appellate Court. It is regrettable that the

learned High Court Judge failed to do that, which goes to the root

of that finding.

The learned counsel for the respondent reading the mind of the

learned High Court Judge submits that in 11R3(a) there is a

minute to that effect (i.e. the petitioner accepted the decision), and

quotes that portion as

. 11R3(a) is dated 12.11.2009 and the arbitration decision

marked P6 is dated 26.01.2013. I cannot understand how the

petitioner agreed the P6 decision dated 26.01.2013 by 11R3(a)

dated 12.11.2009.

If the respondent says that the petitioner admitted the liability for

shortage of goods during the course of inquiry, there would not

have been any reason to proceed with the inquiry any further. The

decision could have been given instantly.

Most importantly, if the petitioner admitted the liability during the

course of inquiry, it would have definitely been stated in the

arbitration decision P6. It may be surprising for the learned

11

counsel for the respondents that there is not a word about such

admission in P6.

Furthermore, although the learned High Court Judge speaks of

suppression, the petitioner has tendered that document 11R3(a) as

P4 with the petition.

There is no suppression of material facts, and there is no failure to

act with uberrima fides by the petitioner.

The counsel for the respondent says that no exceptional

circumstances have been shown to exist for this Court to entertain

this revision application and no reason has been adduced why the

petitioner could not exercise his right of appeal against the order of

the High Court.

According to paragraph 23 of the petition, the petitioner has also

filed an appeal against the impugned order of the High Court. It is

not clear what happened to the appeal.

In any event, if the order is palpably wrong, in my view, that itself

is an exceptional circumstance to set aside the order by exercising

the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court by way of revision.

In Sinnathangam v. Meeramohideen13 T.S. Fernando J. held that:

The Supreme Court possesses the power to set aside, in

revision, an erroneous decision of the District Court in an

appropriate case even though an appeal against such decision

has been correctly held to have abated on the ground of non-

compliance with some of the technical requirements in respect

of the notice of security.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed14 Sansoni C.J. stated:

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of

this Court. Its object is the due administration of justice and

the correction of errors, sometimes committed by this Court

itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of justice.

In Rasheed Ali v. Mohamed Ali15 the Supreme CourtWeeraratne

J., Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) and Wanasundara J.held that:

The powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very

wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that power

whether or not an appeal lies.

In Saheeda Umma v. Haniffa16 the application for restitutio in

integrum filed by the plaintiff-petitioner could not be successful as

it was prescribed. Nevertheless, as there was a serious injustice

caused to the petitioner, Asoka de Silva J. (later C.J.) with

Weerasuriya J. agreeing ex mero motu granted the relief invoking

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court:

Powers of Revision of this Court are wide enough to embrace a

case of this nature. Even though the plaintiff-petitioners have

not invoked the revisionary jurisdiction we propose to exercise

the Revisionary powers in favour of the 2nd plaintiff-

petitioner.

Where a miscarriage of justice has occurred, as in this case, the

Court of Appeal can, under Article 138 of the Constitution, exercise

revisionary powers of the Court to undo the injustice.

The order of the learned High Court Judge dated 20.05.2016, in

my view, is ex facie erroneous. I set aside that order and direct the

incumbent High Court Judge to formally issue notice on the

respondents and take further steps in accordance with law.

Application allowed. No costs.
