This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Gampaha dated

07.12.2000.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above styled action seeking a declaration that

deed no. 23076 (P1jV2) dated 13.12.1983 attested by P.A.C.S. Perera Notary Public is not a deed

signed by the Appellant and that the title of the Appellant to the land more fully described in the

schedule to the plaint has not been ended by deed no. 14352 (V1) dated 25.08.1984 attested by

Sarath C. Jayawardena Notary Public.

The father of the parties one Makewitage Stevan Perera Samarasinghe became the owner of the

land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint. The Appellant contends that upon his

death his rights devolved on his wife and seven children including the parties, which is admitted

by the Defendant-Respondent (Respondent).

Some of the said children namely Parakrama Pathiraja Samarasinghe, luxman Pathiraja

Samarasinghe, Gamini Pathiraja Samarasinghe and Dharmasiri Samarasinghe had executed a

partition deed no. 14352 (V1) dividing the land among the parties to the deed wherein it is stated

that the Appellant had transferred his interest in the corpus by deed no. 23076 (P1/V2) the

execution of which is denied by the Appellant.

The learned District Judge held that the evidence establishes that the Appellant had signed deed

no. 23076 (P1jV2) and dismissed the action without costs. Hence this appeal.

The main question in this appeal is whether the evidence establishes the due execution of deed

no. 23076 (P1jV2).

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Respondent moved for a commission

on the Government Analysts department to examine the signatures on the impugned deed but

went ahead with the trial without calling such evidence and thereby the Court misdirected itself

in proceeding with trial whilst the report of the Examiner of Questioned Documents was pending.

This submission is misconceived in law.

Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:

"lf a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as evidence until one

attesting witness at least has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there

be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the court and capable of giving

evidence."

A deed for the sale or transfer of land, being a document, which is required by law to be attested,

has to be proved in the manner set out in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance by proof that the

maker (the vendor) of that document signed it in the presence of witnesses and the notary. If

this is not done the document and its contents cannot be used in evidence. [Samarakoon v.

Gunasekera and Another (2011) 1 Sri.L.R. 149].

The two attesting witnesses to deed no. 23076 (Pl/V2) Wickremapala and Jayatilleke were called

as witnessess by the Respondent and testified to their signatures thereon. Wickremapala said

that the notary signed after the Appellant and two witnesses [Appeal Brief pages 66, 70-1].

Jayatilleke said that he was there when the Appellant signed [Appeal Brief page 91]. The learned

District Judge has accepted their evidence and held that although the Appellant suggested that

the witnesses lied there is no basis to that suggestion.

The learned counsel for the Appellant has referred to some portions of the evidence of the two

witnesses Wickremapala and Jayatilleke and contended that there are contradictions. I am not

convinced with this submission and in any event, they are not material contradictions. As

Weerasuriya S.P.J. held in The Queen v. Ju/is (65 N.L.R. 505 at 524) "the maximum fa/sus in uno,

fa/sus in omnibus" is not an absolute rule which has to be applied in every case where a witness

is shown to have given false evidence on a material point." When one considers the evidence of

the Appellant more serious questions arise as to the creditworthiness of his testimony for

instance, he did not make a complaint to the Police although he became aware of the existence

of deed no. 23076 (Pl/V2) which according to him he never executed.

"

In The Solicitor General v. Ava Umma (71 N.L.R. 512 at 515-6) T.S. Fernando J. held:

liThe object of calling the two witnesses is to prove the execution of the deed. Proof of

the execution of the documents mentioned in Section 2 of NO.7 of 1840, means proof of

the identity of the person who signed as maker and proof that the document was signed

in the presence of a notary and two or more witnesses present at the same time who

attested the execution./I

Hence the Respondent has proved that the Appellant had signed deed no. 23076 (PljV2) by

calling both the attesting witnesses and there was no need for him to obtain a commission to

examine the hand writing.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Gampaha dated 07.12.2000.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
