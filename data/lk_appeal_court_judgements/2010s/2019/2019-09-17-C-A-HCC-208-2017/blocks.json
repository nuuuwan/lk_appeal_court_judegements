    "text": "27. This Court would not interfere with a sentence imposed by a Trial Judge unless it is against the law or wrong in principle. The sentence prescribed by law for the offence of grave sexual abuse in terms of section 365 b (2) b of the Penal Code is rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 7 years and not exceeding 20 years and with a fine and compensation to the victim as determined by Court. Therefore, the sentence of 18 years of imprisonment ordered by the learned Trial Judge is well within the prescribed sentence.",

The mitigating factors submitted by the counsel for the Accused (Appellant) had been his age, his personal details, that he is married with 2 children and the fact that he was a first offender. Although the learned Trial Judge has miscalculated the age di fference between the victim child and the Appellant to be more than 40 years, the correct age difference of 24 years should be considered as an aggravating factor, not as a mitigating factor. The Appellant had been a 34-year-old man when he sexually abused the ll-year-old victim. Therefore, the only remaining mitigating factor submitted other than his personal circumstances is that he was a first offender. The learned Trial judge has given sufficient reasons as to why a deterrent punishment should be imposed and to justify the sentence imposed by him. Hence, this Court will not interfere with the sentence as well.",
