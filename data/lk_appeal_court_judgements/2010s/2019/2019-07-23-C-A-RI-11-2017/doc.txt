A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

his is an application for restitutio in integrum and revision sought under Article under

138 (1) of the Constitution. Both counsel have made submissions on the merits and

demerits of the judgment of the District Court of Kurunegala in this partition case filed by

the Plaintiff,Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") and the

Defendant, Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") pleads

specifically that the judgment of the District Court dated 31.10.2005 is tainted with a

fundamental vice and that this Court must exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction in

order to ensure that a miscarriage of justice that has been meted out to the Defendant is

ameliorated. This is a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and that story

repays attention but not before I have dealt with the factual template in the case.

The original Plaintiff one Punchathi instituted this action against the Defendant,

Petitioner in the District Court of Kurunegala on 08.10.1999 seeking a partition of the

corpus more fully described in the schedule to the plaint. The Plaintiff's action was based

on the following premise:'

a) An undivided half share was owned by one Sriyathi and upon her death, her

daughter Sopina inherited her rights via maternal inheritance.

b) Sopina on Deed bearing No.19637 and dated 04.11.1977 conveyed her rights to the

Plaintiff Punchathi.

c) Samaneris,the father of the Defendant, Petitioner had been in possession of the

other half of the land so that the Defendant became entitled to the balance half

share.

On this basis, the Plaintiff pleaded that the land should be partitioned with one half to be

allotted to her and the other half to Somapala (Defendant). Though the Plaintiff was

charitable enough to admit that the balance half must go the Defendant, what turned out

to be established at the trial was to the contrary.

The Plaintiff claimed that the corpus was constituted by Lot Nos.1, 2 and 3 of the

preliminary plan bearing No.670 of one Licensed Surveyor called R.B. Moragane. 2

In his amended statement of claim, the Defendant claimed that the land sought to be

partitioned has to be Lots Nos.1 and 3 of the aforesaid preliminary plan.

According to the points of contest that were raised on behalf of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff

Punchathi specifically put in issue whether one half share of the corpus should be

allotted to her in terms of the devolution of rights pleaded by her from Sopina who had

transferred one half share of the land to her by way of the Deed bearing No.19637 and

dated 04.04.1997. Thus the Plaintiff claimed the one half tracing it to the deed of sale that

flowed from Sopina. Sopina herself had inherited this one half, according to the plaint,

from her mother Sriyathi. Upon Sriyathi's death, the one half that Sriyathi had possessed

of this land had devolved on Sopina and Sopina transferred the one half in 1997 to the

Plaintiff. This was how the devolution was pleaded.

The point of contest based on this devolution has been answered in favor of the Plaintiff

by the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kurunegala dated 31.10.2005. In other

words the District Court allotted the Plaintiff one half of Lots 1, 2 and 3.

The story of the Defendant was otherwise different to that of the Plaintiff. According to

him, he sought the exclusion of Lot No.2, which was a different land that had been

prescribed by him. Barring Lot No.2, it is Lot Nos.1 and 3 that should form the corpus for

partition. He formulated this position in the form of a point of contest. Allied to this

issue is also his point of contest N 0.16 wherein the Defendant claimed the exclusion of

Lot 2 on the plea of prescription.

Thus it could be seen that according to the Plaintiff, the corpus is constituted by Lots 1, 2

and 3 of the preliminary plan bearing No.670 and the Plaintiff sought one half of this

corpus, whereas the Defendant sought the exclusion of Lot 2 on the basis of prescription

and according to the Defendant, the corpus sought to be partitioned should only be Lot 1

and 3.

At the end of the trial, the learned District Judge of Kurunegala held in favor of the

Plaintiff concluding that the corpus is constituted by Lots 1, 2 and 3 and allotted half of

this corpus to the Plaintiff and he kept the remaining one half unallotted. There is also

3

finding by the learned District Judge of Kurunegala that the Defendant has not prescribed

to Lot 2. Thus one could see that the District Judge gave the Defendant no interest in the

land, though the Plaintiff had conceded in her statement of claim one half to him. The

learned District Judge left the other half share unallotted because he took the view that

the Defendant failed to establish his title to the other half share. The pith and substance

of the judgment of the learned District Judge amounted to a dismissal of the statement of

claim filed by the Defendant.

Before I indulge in an analysis of the issues in the case, I have to narrate the other steps

that took place in this labyrinthine litigation. Aggrieved by the judgment dated

31.10.2005, the Defendant preferred an appeal to this Court which was later transferred

to the High Court of Civil Appeals of the North Western Province holding its sittings in

Kurunegala. That Court by its judgment dated 30.08.2011 set aside the judgment of the

learned District Judge for what it called a want of investigation of title on the part of the

District Judge and dismissed the action filed by the Plaintiff. The gist of the judgment of

the Civil Appellate Court among many other things was that the Plaintiff Punchathi had

failed to prove her pedigree.

It transpired later that at the time of the delivery of the judgment of the Civil Appellate

Court on 30.08.2011, the Plaintiff Punchathi had crossed the great divide and her son

Siyapathiyalage Wijeratne (the Substituted Plaintiff. .. Respondent to the application

before this Court) preferred a leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and after having

granted leave, the Supreme Court (Marsoof, PC, J. with Suresh Chandra, J. and Dep, PC,

J. as His Lordship then was) held on 16.03.2012 in -SC HCCALA No.398/11 that the

judgment of the Civil Appellate Court dated 30.08.2011 was a nullity and that these facts

must be brought to the notice of the Civil Appellate High Court. The Supreme Court

remanded the case to the Civil Appellate Court for an appropriate order.

When the case was remitted back to the High Court of the Civil Appeals in Kurunegala,

substitution took place and a different bench of the Court by its judgment dated

06.02.2014, dismissed the Defendant'S appeal.

4

It has to be noted whilst the 1st Civil Appellate bench of the High Court set aside the

judgment of the learned District Judge and allowed the appeal of the Defendant, the 2nd

bench of the Civil Appellate High Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court and

dismissed the appeal of the Defendant.

The Provincial High Court exercising the appellate jurisdiction alluded to a judgment of

Gratiaen, J. (with whom Alan Rose C.J had concurred) Karunaratne v. Sirimalie (1951)

53 N.L.R 444 wherein the learned Judge had held "where in a partition action, all

possible claimants are manifestly before Court, no higher standard of proof should be

called for in determining the question of title than in any other civil suit." Having cited

this judgment, the Civil Appellate Court gave its imprimatur to the judgment of the

District Judge stating that the learned District Judge of Kurunegala had properly

investigated title.

So Gratiaen, J. imposed a burden on the trial court judge that he must satisfy himself that

all possible claimants are before him. If it is manifest that at least one claimant is not

before Court there would be no proper investigation of title. Then there will be a

manifest error in the judgment. I would add that a proper investigation would not only

involve the ascertainment of all claimants but also engage the question whether the

claims presented before Court were investigated fully and properly by Court.

Having thus failed in the Civil Appellate Court, the Defendant took the matter to the

Supreme Court where he was met with a preliminary objection that his leave to appeal

was time barred. The Supreme Court by its order dated 22nd May 2107 upheld the

preliminary objection and dismissed the application for leave to appeal. In other words

the merit of the appeal was not adjudicated upon in the Supreme Court and so the

upshot of all this is that the judgment of the 2nd bench of the Civil Appellate Court dated

06.02.2014 affirming the judgment of the District Court dated 31.10.2005 remained valid,

when the Defendant petitioned this Court for restitutio in integrum and revision by this

application dated loth July 2017. So much for the litigation history of this case.

5

When this matter was taken up for hearing, Mr. Ranjan Gooneratne the learned Counsel

for the Defendant--Petitioner submitted that the judgment of the District Court is so

perverse that it cries out for intervention by this Court in its exercise of restitutio in

integrum or revision.

Restitutio in Integrum

I have to observe that the Court of Appeal is the only Court that is vested with the

jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution and this

jurisdiction has not been specifically conferred on the provincial high court of civil

appeals.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution vested in the Court Appeal sole and exclusive

jurisdiction to grant relief by way of restitutio in integrum. The passage of the High Courts

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No.54 of 2006 did not have the

effect of transferring or conferring this jurisdiction on the High Courts of Civil Appeals.

On a perusal of Section 5A(I) of the High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act No.54 of 2006, the High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province was conferred with appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or

Family Court within such Province, but jurisdiction to hear applications for restitutio in

integrum has not been so conferred on the Provincial High Court.

Section 5A(2) of this Act enacts that, "The provisions of Section 23 to 27 of the

Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 and Sections 753 to 760 and Sections 765 to m of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to the exercise of the

jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the Court of Appeal, shall be read and

construed as including a reference to a High Court established by Article 154 P of the

Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved by any judgment, decree or order of

a District Court or Family Court, as the case may be, within a province, may invoke the

jurisdiction referred to in that subsection, in the High Court established for that

Province. "

6

A conferral of a particular jurisdiction in a Court cannot be lightly presumed and there

must be an express conferment of such jurisdiction. There is no express conferral of

restitutio in integrum in the High Courts. There is another reason why I hold the view that

the High Court of Civil Appeals does not enjoy restitutio in integrum. If High Courts enjoy

this jurisdiction, the question arises~to which Court does an appeal from such

jurisdiction lie? There is no such right of appeal expressly conferred by statute on any

court as a right of appeal has to be expressly provided for in a statute. Therefore the

jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum does not reside in High Courts of Civil Appeals.

This Court assumed jurisdiction over this matter because restitutio in integrum is

specifically provided for in Section 48 of Partition Law No.21 of 1977. The finality of

partition decrees can be impeached in this Court by virtue of revision and restitutio in

integrum.

Before I deal with the fundamental vice that Mr. Ranjan Gooneratne complained of, the

perversity of the judgment seems to be present in another aspect of the matter where

exclusion of Lot 2 sought by Defendant has been disallowed by the learned District

Judge.

Exclusion of Lot 2

At page 112 of the Appeal Brief the Plaintiff herself admits that Somapala had been living

fenced off in Lot 2. It had been fenced off for nearly 37 years. So Lot 2, on the Plaintiff's

own evidence, had been separated for 30 years prior to the date she gave evidence in

2004. Somapala (the Defendant) says this as well (see page 125 of the Appeal Brief). The

Defendant's evidence that he had been separately possessing Lot 2 has been corroborated

by the Plaintiff. That explains why the Defendant wanted an exclusion. The learned

District Judge of Kurunegala does not refer to this aspect of the case at all in his judgment

dated 31.10.2005.

Even though the Plaintiff claimed one~half of Lots 1, 2 and 3, upon the evidence of the

predecessor in title of the Plaintiff, there is strong evidence of adverse possession of Lot 2

7

by the Defendant. Lot 2 therefore cries out for an exclusion but the learned District Judge

just brushed aside this question of adverse possession that had surfaced to the fore.

Instead the learned District Judge goes on the basis that what Sopina (the predecessor in

title of the Plaintiff) passed to the Plaintiff by way of PI dealt with the entire land (Lot 1,

2 and 3), whereas it is quite clear upon the evidence of Sopina herself that she could not

have passed Lot 2 to the Plaintiff (P2 is dated 04.04.1977). By 04.04.1997, the separate

possession of Lot 2 on the part of the Defendant was almost 15 years.

I have examined the evidence given on behalf of both the Plaintiff and Defendant and I

find that the elements of adverse possession necessary to give rise to prescription are rife

in this case and a case for an exclusion of Lot 2 was thus made out. This appears to me as

a manifest error in the judgment that has to be remedied in this jurisdiction.

Transfer without title ... Feeding the Estoppel

Next I get on to the question of transfer of one half of Lots 1, 2 and 3 by Sopina which Mr.

Ranjan Gooneratne for the Defendant ... Petitioner argued was a transfer without title to

one fourth. In other words Sopina had only one fourth but she purported to transfer one

half.

Mr. Ranjan Gooneratne for the Defendant ... Petitioner argued that this was a fundamental

vice that vitiates the judgment of the District Court dated 31.10.2005. He contended that

this fundamental vice emanated from what he called the cardinal error which the learned

District Judge made when he allotted one half of Lots 1, 2 and 3 to the Plaintiff.

According to him, Sopina (the predecessor in title of the Plaintiff) could not have

transferred one half because she did not have one half at the time of transfer. She only

had title to one fourth. Upon the death of Sopina's mother Sriyathi who had one half,

Sopina could have got only one fourth as her father who was alive at that time of the

death of Sriyathi inherited the other one fourth share. In fact Sriyathi predeceased her

husband and it is clear that at the time of transfer of one half to the Plaintiff, Sopina had

only one fourth. The balance one fourth resided in Sopina's father. The fact that Sopina's

father was alive at the time of transfer is also spoken to by Plaintiff who says that

8

Sopina's father married her later on. In other words the Plaintiff became the second wife

of Sopina's father. I would accept the argument that at the time of transfer Sopina had

only one fourth and the learned District Judge was oblivious to this fact. He goes on the

basis that Sopina had one half and allots one half to the Plaintiff.

Notwithstanding this fact which the learned District Judge failed to notice, I yet hold

that the decision of the District Judge to allot one half can be rationalized and justified.

It is my view that though Sopina purported to transfer one..-half to the Plaintiff, whereas

she had only 1/4th, her father's V4th share would have devolved on her later upon the

death of her father. The death of Sopina's father was not disputed at all. Admittedly there

were no other siblings that Sopina had. By the time the trial came around, it is a given

that Sopina's father was no longer living and his V4th share had to devolve on Sopina.

Though Sopina did not have title to the V4th share of her father when she effected its

transfer to the Plaintiff, she acquired title to the 1/4th share upon the death of her father.

Bertram C.J held in Gunatilleke v. Fernando (1919) 21 N.L.R 257 that Roman Dutch law

is in accord with the English law on the subject that a person who sells the property is

estopped from disputing the title of his vendee, and that when he subsequently acquires

title, that title passes to his vendee ... see Gamagedara Jayaratne v. Gamagedara

Karunawathie and three others C.A. Case No.67V1997 (F) D.C. Kandy 12838/P (CA

minutes of 19.06.20180). This principle that forms the fulcrum of the defence of "exceptiO

rei venditae et traditae" emanates from the equitable principle of feeding the estoppel ... see

Doe v. Oliver2 Smith's Leading Cases, 11th edition, 724.

Thus the Plaintiff derived one..-half from Sopina and the question arises how this one ... half

should be given to the Plaintiff. I have already held that Lot 2 must be excluded as there

has been long possession of Lot 2 by the Defendant. This has received barely any

attention of all the judges who dealt with the case and there is a such manifest error

which this Court feels impelled to rectify in its jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum. If Lot 2

is excluded in favour of the Defendant, one ... half that the Plaintiff wanted to be allotted

can be given from Lot 1 and 3. But the Plaintiff had sought in her plaint one..-half of Lots 1,

9

2 and 3. When the Defendant succeeds in having Lot No.2 excluded, it is nothing but fair

that the Plaintiff gets an extent which is equal to the one half of Lots 1,2 and 3. But this

one half, albeit equal to the one half of the total extent of Lots 1, 2 and 3, must emanate

from Lots 1 and 3. After giving the one--half to the Plaintiff from Lot 1 and 3, the remaining

share can be kept unallotted, as there are no claims to the remainder.

To this extent, the judgment of the District Court dated 31.10.2005 is set aside and

varied. In the circumstances the judgment of the Civil Appellate Court dated 06.02.2014

which affirmed the judgment of the District Court is perforce set aside in the exercise of

restitutio in integrum. The learned District Judge of Kurunegala is to enter decree accordingly

namely Lot 2 has to be excluded in favour of the Defendant. The total extent of Lots 1, 2

and 3 is 161.5 perches. One--half of the total extent of the land that the Plaintiff wanted

(Lot 1,2 and 3) would be 80.75 perches. This extent of 80.75 perches can be carved out of

the combined extent of Lots 1 and 3 which is equivalent to 89.30 perches.

The extent of 80.75 perches (one--half of the total extent of Lots 1, 2 and 3 namely 161.5

perches) has to be given to the Plaintiff from the total extent of Lots 1 and 3--i.e., 89.30

perches and the remainder (8.55 perches) has to be kept unallotted. In a nutshell the

final scheme of partition will carry the following:--

1. Lot 2 to be excluded in favor of the Defendant.

2. 80.75 perches to be given to the Plaintiff from the total extent of 89.30 perches of

Lots 1 and 3.

3. The remainder namely an extent of 8.55 perches of Lots 1 and 3 must be kept

unallotted.
