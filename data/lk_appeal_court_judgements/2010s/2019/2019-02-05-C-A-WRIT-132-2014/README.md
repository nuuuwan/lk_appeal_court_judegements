Samayawardhena, J.

This application of the petitioners concerns the calculation of

extra remuneration to be paid to the petitioners from the income

generated through private sample testing at the laboratories of

the Colombo Municipal Council.

The petitioners have sought the following reliefs in the prayer to

the petition.

(c) To issue a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the

12th respondent marked P29

(d) To issue a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the

2nd and/or 3rd and/or 6th respondents marked P30

(e) To issue a writ of certiorari to quash the part of the

Resolution marked P28 whereby it has been resolved to

calculate the allowances to be calculated at 35% from the

75% profit earned from the investigations

(f) To issue writ of mandamus compelling the 1st-6th

respondents to make the payments to the petitioners for

testing of private samples in terms of the Resolution

marked P8 and the amended Resolution marked P14

Whilst the case was pending, the 12th respondent by letter dated

08.12.2014 has withdrawn the decision marked P29. A copy of

this letter has been tendered to Court (with a copy to the

Attorney-at-Law of the petitioner) by way of a motion of the

Attorney-at-Law of the 12th respondent dated 19.01.2015. This

was also reiterated by the learned State Counsel appearing for

the 5th and 12th respondents in open Court on 10.09.2018.

Hence there is no difficulty in formally quashing P29 by

certiorari.

3

Relief (c) above is granted.

P30 is based on P29. If P29 is withdrawn or quashed, P30

cannot survive independently.

In addition, what has been stated in P30 about imposing VAT on

the income generated through private sample testing has been

reiterated in the Resolution marked P28, which part has not

been challenged by the petitioners in this application.

Hence I formally quash P30.

Relief (d) above is granted.

The principal argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners

in respect of the relief (c) above was that the financial powers of

the Municipal Council are with the Standing Committee on

Finance and the (General) Council and not with the 5th

respondent Commissioner of Local Government or the 12th

respondent Governor of the Province.

There cannot be any dispute that Resolutions marked P8, P14

and P28 referred to in (e) and (f) above were adopted by the

Standing Committee on Finance and the (General) Council.

Hence the petitioners whilst accepting the parts contained in

P28 which are favourable to them, cannot successfully challenge

one unfavourable part of it whereby the petitioners extra

remuneration was reduced (not totally denied) after serious

deliberations. That decision to revise the extra remuneration in

respect of testing of private samples using State resources, in

my view, is not ex facie unreasonable to quash by way of

certiorari.

4

Relief (e) cannot be granted.

The petitioners cannot in any event ask this Court to compel the

respondents by mandamus to make those extra payments

according to the Resolution marked P8 and/or P14. Resolution

P8 was amended by Resolution P14. Resolution P14 was further

amended by Resolution P28. There is no illegality or irregularity

in it. Such amendments can, according the petitioners

themselves, be done by the Standing Committee on Finance and

the (General) Council. There is absolutely no basis for relief (f)

above.

Relief (f) is refused.

Application of the petitioners is partly allowed.

No costs.
