This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Kegalle dated

07.07.1999.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above styled action seeking a declaration of title

to the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint, an order of eviction against the

original Defendants who are allegedly in unlawful possession of the land more fully described in

the second schedule to the plaint and damages.

The original Defendants denied the title ofthe Appellant and claimed prescriptive title and moved

for a dismissal of the action. However, they did not make a cross-claim.

The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action of the Appellant and hence this appeal.

A perusal of the plaint filed in this action shows without any doubt that it is a rei vindicatio action.

To succeed in an action rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a balance of probabilities, not

only his or her ownership in the property, but also that the property exists and is clearly

identifiable. The identity of the land is fundamental for the purpose of attributing ownership, and

for ordering ejectment [Lathee! v. Mansoor and another (2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 333J. In such an action

it is a paramount duty on the part of the Plaintiff to establish correct boundaries in order to

identify the land in dispute [Peeris v. Savunhamy (54 N.L.R. 207)J. There is a greater and heavy

burden on a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action to prove not only that he has dominium to the land

Page 2 of 7

in dispute but also the specific precise and definite boundaries when claiming a declaration of

title [Abeykoon Hamine v. Appuhamy (52 N.L.R. 49)]. In a vindicatory action it is necessary to

establish the identity of the corpus in a clear and unambiguous manner and the action must fail

upon the failure to do so [Fernando v. Somasiri (2012 B.L.R. 121)].

The learned Additional District Judge held that the Appellant had failed to establish both his title

to the land in dispute and the identity of the said land and as such the action must fail.

The case of the Appellant is primarily based on the assertion that the land more fully described

as lot 2 containing in extent A. 139 R.O P.O and depicted in plan no. 67415 (PI) of the Surveyor

General dated 25.10.1866 is the property of Wattaramey Vihare. Issue no. 2 is based on this

position and the learned Additional District Judge held that it was not proved.

Plan no. 67415 (PI) of the Surveyor General dated 25.10.1866 was marked without subject to

proof and was led in evidence at the close of the case of the Appellant without any objection. It

is a plan prepared by the Surveyor General which describes lots 1 and 2 therein as property of

Wattaramey Vihare.

In this context section 83 ofthe Evidence Ordinance is instructive and reads:

"Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor-

General or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate"

(emphasis added)

Furthermore, as the trial took place before the repeal of the Land Surveys Ordinance section 6

therein is relevant which reads:

"If any plan or survey offered in evidence in any suit shall purport to be signed by the

Surveyor-General or officer acting on his behalf, such plan or survey shall be received in

evidence, and may be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts exhibited therein; and it

shall not be necessary to prove that it was in fact signed by the Surveyor-General or officer

acting on his behalf, nor that it was made by his authority, nor that the same is accurate,

until evidence to the contrary shall have first been given." (emphasis added)

In Kiri Mudiyanse v. the Attorney-General (48 N.L.R. 438) the Supreme Court accepted that the

entry in a plan prepared by the Surveyor-General that some fields shown therein formed part of

an abandoned tank must be accepted as prima facie proof of that fact in terms of section 60fthe

Land Surveys Ordinance.

The original Defendants did not seek to assail the plan no. 67415 (P1) of the Surveyor General

dated 25.10.1866 and as such this evidence becomes unchallenged evidence [Edrick De Silva v.

Chandradasa De Silva (70 N.L.R. 169), Seyed Shahabdeen Najimuddin v. Thureiratnam

Nageshwari nee Sunderalingam and Others (S.C./Appl/165/2010, S.C.M. 17.07.2013)].

Accordingly, there was evidence before the District Court that lot 2 of plan no. 67415 (P1) of the

Surveyor General dated 25.10.1866 is the property ofthe Wattaramey Vihare.

A temple is an institution, sui generis which is capable of receiving and holding property that has

attributes of a corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding property [Kosgoda

Pangnaseela v. Gamage Pavisthinahamy [(1986) 3 C.A.L.R. 48], Ven. Omare Dhammapala Thera

v. Rajapakshage Peiris [(2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 1].

Hence, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge erred in holding that issue no. 2 was not

proved. The Appellant did prove that lot 2 of plan no. 67415 (P1) of the Surveyor-General dated

25.10.1866 is the property of Wattaramey Vihare.

The remaining question is whether the Appellant has proved that the land more fully described

in schedule 2 to the plaint falls within the land described in the schedule to the plaint which as

explained above has been proved to be the property of Wattaramey Vihare.

The Appellant led the evidence of GAR. Perera, Licensed Surveyor who prepared plan no. 247

(P2). He testified that the Appellant had shown him the land in dispute and that he had drawn a

plan for the said land which was later superimposed on plan no. 67415 (P1) of the Surveyor

General dated 25.10.1866. Based on the superimposition he testified that it can be said that

subject to a slight variation in the western boundary the land in plan no. 67415 (P1) is included in

plan no. 247 (P2).

The learned counsel for the Substituted 1st Defendant-Respondents and 2nd Defendant-

Respondent submitted that the testimony of GAR. Perera, Licensed Surveyor did not establish

that the land in plan no. 6741S (P1) is included in plan no. 247 (P2). I am unable to accede to this

submission. The evidence of the said surveyor as a whole does establish that pOSition. There

appears to be a divergence between the parties as to the name of the land in dispute. However,

the superimposition in my view must be the determinative factor. The slight variation in the

western boundary is insignificant and must be understood in the context of the superimposition

being done using a plan made in 1866.

Therefore, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge erred in holding that the Appellant

had failed to establish both his title and the identity of the land.

Page 4of7

There is also the question of prescriptive title of the original Defendants to be considered.

Section 34 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance reads:

"In the case of any claim for the recovery of any property, movable or immovable,

belonging or alleged to belong to any temple, or for the assertion of title to any such

property, the claim shall not be held to be barred or prejudiced by any provision of the

Prescription Ordinance:

Provided that this section shall not affect rights acquired prior to the commencement of

this Ordinance."

In Piyaratana Thera v. Jathiya and Anather [(1985) 2 SrLL.R. 418) the Supreme Court held that

where title by prescription to Buddhist temple land had not been acquired prior to 1931, section

34 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance bars the acquisition of prescriptive title to temple

land. The original 1st Defendant testified that he began possessing the land he is presently

occupying in 1935 [Appeal brief pages 114, 119).

Accordingly, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge erred in answering issue no. 11 in

the affirmative.

The learned counsel for the Substituted 1st Defendant-Respondents and 2nd Defendant-

Respondent submitted that it is trite law that the best person to determine issues in relation to

the facts of the case is the trial judge who hears and sees the witnesses and his findings should

not be lightly disturbed in appeal [De Silva and Others v. seneviratne and Anather (1981) 2 SrLL.R.

7, Fradd v. Brawn & Ca. Ltd. (20 N.L.R. 282), 0.5. Mahawithana v. Cammissianer of Inland Revenue

(64 N.L.R. 217), Alwis v. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SrLL.R. 119).

However, when the findings of fact are based upon the trial judges evaluation of facts, the

Appellate Court is then in as good a position as the trial judge to evaluate such facts and no

sanctity attaches to such findings of fact of a trial judge and where it appears to an Appellate

Court that the findings of the trial judge should be reversed because he has fai led to properly

evaluate the facts, then the Appellate Court "ought not to shrink from that task" [De Silva and

Others v. seneviratne and Another (supra), Anulawathie v. Gunapala (1998) 1 SrLL.R. 63, De Silva

v. De Croas (2002) 2 SrLL.R. 409) .

Page 5 of7

For the reasons more fully set out above, the learned Additional District Judge has failed to

properly evaluate the facts. I therefore set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District

Judge of Kegalle dated 07.07.1999 and answer the issues raised at the trial as follows:
