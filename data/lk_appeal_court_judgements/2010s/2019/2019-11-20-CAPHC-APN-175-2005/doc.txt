The petitioner, the Chairman, Katunayake Seeduwa Urban

Counsel, filed this application under section 28A(3) of the Urban

Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978, as amended1, in the

Magistrates Court of Negombo against the Director, Sri Lanka

Islamic Center, No.12, Rajapokuna Mawatha, Colombo 10, as

the respondent, seeking a demolition order in respect of a two-

storied building and 20 toilets at No. 761, Liyanagemulla,

Seeduwa, which have been constructed by the respondent

without a Permit. The respondent did not contest the

petitioners claim. The respondent has, in fact, given his

consent in writing for the demolition of those unauthorized

buildings.2

1 Hereinafter the UDA Law. 2 Vide page 2 of the High Court order at page 20 of the brief.

The respondent was not the person who constructed those

unauthorized buildings. They have, admittedly, been

constructed by the intervenient petitioner, Sailan International

School, who is the lessee under the respondent in terms of the

Lease Agreement No.1282.3

The learned Magistrate has, by order dated 21.02.2005, rejected

the reliefs sought by the intervenient petitioner in its application

dated 05.01.20044 on the basis inter alia that the respondent

has not complied with the Notice sent to him under section

28A(1) of the UDA Law.5 The High Court has also affirmed the

Magistrates Court order. The intervenient petitioner has filed

this revision application against the said order of the High

Court.

The only argument mounted by the learned counsel for the

intervenient petitioner before this Court is that, without proper

Notice in terms of section 28A(1) being first served on the

intervenient petitioner as the person who has executed such

development activity, no demolition order could have been made

by the learned Magistrate.

I am in total agreement with the aforementioned submission of

the learned counsel for the intervenient petitioner.

Section 28A(1) of the UDA Law reads as follows:

Where in a development area, any development activity is

commenced, continued, resumed or completed without

3 Vide pages 92-96 of the brief. 4 Vide the Application at pages 74-90 of the brief. 5 Vide paragraph 3 of the order at page 65 of the brief.

4

permit or contrary to any term or condition set out in a

permit issued in respect of such development activity, the

Authority may, in addition to any other remedy available to

the Authority under this Law, by written notice require the

person who is executing or has executed such

development activity, or has caused it to be executed,

on or before such day as shall be specified in such notice,

not being less than seven days from the date thereof

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development

activity is being executed or has been executed, to

its original condition; or

(c) to secure compliance with the permit under the

authority of which that development activity is

carried out or engaged in, or with any term or

condition of such permit, and for the purposes of

compliance with the requirements aforesaid

(i) to discontinue the use of any land or

building; or

(ii) to demolish or alter any building or work.

Section 28A(2) states:

It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is

issued under subsection (1) to comply with any requirement

specified in such notice within the time specified in such

notice or within such extended time as may be granted by

the Authority on application made in that behalf.

5

Section 28A(3) spells out the procedure to be adopted by the

Magistrate in the event the person who is executing or has

executed such development activity without a valid Permit fails

to comply with the Notice served on him. That section runs as

follows:

28A(3)(a) Where any person has failed to comply with any

requirement contained in any written notice issued under

subsection (1) within the time specified in the notice or

within such extended time as may have been granted by

the Authority, the Authority may, by way of petition and

affidavit, apply to the Magistrate to make an Order

authorizing the Authority to-

(a) to discontinue the use of any land or building;

(b) to demolish or alter any building or work;

(c) to do all such other acts as such person was

required to do by such notice, as the case may be,

and the Magistrate shall after serving notice on the person

who had failed to comply with the requirements of the

Authority under subsection (1), if he is satisfied to the same

effect, make order accordingly.

(b) If such person undertakes to discontinue the use of the

land or building or to demolish or alter the building or work,

or to do such other acts as are referred to in paragraph (a)

of subsection 3 of section 28A, the Magistrate may, if he

thinks fit, postpone the operation of the Order for such time

not exceeding two months as he thinks sufficient for the

6

purpose of giving such person an opportunity of complying

with such requirement.

There is no doubt that, in terms of section 28A(1) of the UDA

Law, the written notice shall be served not on the owner of the

premises, but on the person who is executing or has executed

such development activity, or has caused it to be executed. In

the instant case, as I stated earlier, the person who executed the

unauthorized development activity is not the respondent (who is

the owner of the premises) but the intervenient respondent (who

is the lessee of the premises).

The counter submission of the learned counsel for the

respondent that: (a) the right person on whom Notice under

section 28A(1) shall be served is the owner of the premises; (b)

the intervenient petitioner knew about the Notice served on the

respondent as the intervenient petitioner came before the

Magistrates Court soon after the institution of the proceedings

against the respondent; (c) no application has been made by the

intervenient petitioner to regularize the unauthorized

development activity are, in my view, unacceptable.

Service of written Notice under section 28A(1) is, in my view, a

sine qua non to the filing of an application in the Magistrates

Court seeking a demolition order under section 28A(3) of the

UDA Law. The Urban Development Authority shall serve the

Notice, and seek the demolition order, against the right person,

who is none other than the person who is making or who made

the unauthorized construction. Service of Notice on some other

7

person including the owner of the property is not sufficient

compliance with section 28A(1) of the UDA Law.

During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the

intervenient respondent drew the attention of the Court to the

decision of this Court in Ivo Fernando v. Somasiri6 where this

Court has held that failure to act in terms of section 28A(3) of

the UDA Law by the Magistrate is a fatal irregularity. In that

case, Notice under section 28A(1) had been served on the

appellant who was the person who has constructed the

unauthorized building, but the learned Magistrate has not

followed the proper procedure as laid down in section 28A(3). In

my view, the facts of the instant case are worse, in that,

admittedly, no statutory Notice contemplated in section 28A(1)

was ever served on the intervenient petitioner who constructed

the unauthorized building.

In the middle of the argument, the learned counsel for the

respondent stated that this argument was never taken up either

before the Magistrates Court or the High Court, and therefore

this argument shall be rejected by this Court.

By reading the Magistrates Court order, it is clear that this

point has been raised before the learned Magistrate, but the

learned Magistrate has taken the view that Notice has been

served on the respondent.

In any event, this is a pure question of law. It is trite law that a

pure question of law, which does not require the ascertainment

of new facts, can be taken up for the first time in appeal.7

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the order of the

Magistrates Court dated 21.02.2005 and the order of the High

Court dated 22.06.2005, and allow the application of the

intervenient petitioner, but without costs.

This will not prevent the petitioner to file a fresh application in

the Magistrates Court against the intervenient petitioner upon

compliance with the procedure set out in the UDA Law.
