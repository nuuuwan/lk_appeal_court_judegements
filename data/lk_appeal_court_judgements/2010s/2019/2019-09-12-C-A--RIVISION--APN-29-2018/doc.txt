*************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The 1st Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

"Petitioner") has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court under

6

"imperative provisions of the Constitution", seeking to set aside an order

of dismissal of his revision application, made by the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province Holden in Colombo on 02.02.2018 under

HCRA/02/2018 which had been filed by him challenging the validity of

an order of the Magistrate's Court of Colombo, in case No. 59287/01/06.

The Complainant Respondent, the Director General of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent"), had instituted proceedings

before the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in the said case bearing No.

59287/01/06, alleging commission of several offences by the Petitioner and

the 2nd to 8th Accused-Respondents, under the Bribery Act (as amended).

Upon service of notice by the Magistrate's Court, the Petitioner

appeared before the learned Magistrate on 30.09.2016 and was enlarged

on bail. On 13.02.2017, the Petitioner had raised a preliminary objection to

the jurisdiction of the Court and had tendered the same in writing on

15.03.2017. The said preliminary objection was that no written sanction of

the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

(hereinafter referred to as the "Commission") was obtained by the

Respondent prior to institution of proceedings before the Magistrate's

Court as per the provisions of Section 78 of the Bribery Act, which imposes

a written sanction of the Commission as a "mandatory requirement".

Having heard the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

contesting parties, the Magistrate's Court made order on 17.11.2017

overruling the said preliminary objection. The Court then proceeded to

read out the charge it had framed to the Petitioner and other Accused-

7

Respondents. After the charges were readout to the Petitioner, the matter

was fixed for trial by the learned Magistrate, who had inferred from his

silence, that he pleaded not guilty.

In the meantime, the Petitioner sought to revise the order of the

Magistrate's Court by which it overruled his preliminary objection. In the

revision application No. HCRA 02/2018 that was filed before the

Provincial High Court, the Petitioner primarily moved the appellate Court

to revise the said order of the original Court whilst praying for many other

reliefs in the interim. The said revision application was supported on

26.01.2018 by the Petitioner. The Provincial High Court had thereafter

postponed its order to 02.02.2018 after informing the Petitioner to provide

any clarification it might need on a day decided by the Court.

However, on 02.02.2018, the Provincial High Court pronounced its

order refusing issuance of notice on the Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Provincial High Court, the

Petitioner filed the instant revision application in this Court challenging

the validity of the order dated 02.02.2018 of the Provincial High Court and

also seeking relief in allowing his" ... application to revise the order of the

Learned Magistrate dated 17th November 2017".

The Petitioner sought to challenge the order of the Provincial High

Court on the following exceptional grounds:

a. The said order is contrary to the provisions of law, imperative

principles of statutory interpretation, to the evidence on the grant

of "sanction and/ or directive",

8

b. The Court misdirected itself in its failure to take cognizance of

the fact that the Commission and Director General are two

distinct bodies in terms of the Bribery Act (as amended),

c. The action instituted before the Magistrate's Court failed to meet

the mandatory pre req uisi te outlined in section 78 of the Bribery

Act (as amended),

d. There was no opportunity afforded to the Petitioner to consider

the charges that had been readout by Court as directed by section

182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. '15 of 1979.

This Court, having heard the submissions of the Petitioner and the

Respondent, who had already been served with notice by the Petitioner,

granted formal notice and interim relief on 04.07.2018, thereby stated the

proceedings before the Magistrate's Court.

In the objections filed by the Respondent, it is stated that" ... the

issues raised by the Counsel for the Petitioner when supporting this

application ... are new issues for which the 1st Respondent has the right to

reply in the oral submissions". The Respondent seeks dismissal of the

petition of the Petitioner.

At the inquiry before this Court, both parties made submissions in

support of their respective positions. They were afforded an opportunity

to tender a precis of their submissions with the authorities they have made

reference to, during oral submissions.

Having considered the submissions of the parties, this Court sought

certain clarifications from the learned Counsel on two issues, on 17.05.2019

which it thought would assist the determination of this application.

9

With this short introduction on the nature and the history of

litigation between the parties, it is helpful at this juncture, if this Court

reproduced the submissions of the respective parties albeit in summary

form.

Learned President's Counsel mounted his challenge on the legal

validity of the orders of the Provincial High Court as well as the

Magistrate's Court, on the applicability of the mandatory statutory

provisions contained in Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act (as amended). He

had set down that the dispute of the parties presented to this Court's

determination as to " ... whether the Magistrate's Court could have

entertained the prosecution for an offence under the Bribery Act without

the Written Sanction as required by Section 78" of the said Act.

I-lis primary contention before tItis Court is that there is no dispute

by the Respondent on the factual position that "no written sanction in

terms of Section 78 has been obtained and/or filed of record in the

Magistrate's Court" where the prosecution against the Petitioner is

conducted. Based on this undisputed fact, learned President's Counsel for

the Petitioner submits that this Court should therefore rule that the

pending prosecution before the Magistrate's Court, that had been

instituted without written sanction of the Commission, is illegal and

accordingly, such proceedings should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.

In his reply on behalf of the Respondent, learned Senior State

Counsel referred to the wording of the Section 78(1) where it is stated that

" ... except by or with" in support of his submission that the Respondent

had stated in the plaint tendered to the Magistrate's Court that such

10

proceedings are instituted with the" directions of the Commission" and

therefore the said reference should satisfy the requirement since it had

been instituted by the Commission itself. Hence, he argued that no written

sanction is necessary when the Commission itself institutes any

prosecution as per the reasoning of the unreported Court of Appeal

judgment in Rodrigo v The Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Comlption - CA/PHC/ 57/99 (decided on 10.11.2010) where

this Court held that the "written sanction would be superfluous as the

Commission has given directions to institute proceedings in the relevant Court."

Learned Senior State Counsel further submits that the Supreme Court had

refused Leave to Appeal when an attempt was made to challenge this

determination by the Court of Appeal.

In defending the order of the Magistrate's Court in overruling the

Petitioner's preliminary objection on written sanction under Section 78(1),

learned Senior State Counsel contended that the original Court was bound

to follow the said judgment of the Court of Appeal on stare decisis principle

and therefore the impugned order is a legally valid order.

The submissions of the parties revolve around the Sinhala text of

Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act (as amended). In view of the submissions,

it has become imperative for this Court to decide the meaning of the

wording of the said section in the Sinhala text, in relation to the

submissions. This endeavour was necessitated due to a defect 111 the

drafting of the amending portion, introduced to Section 78(1) of the

principle enactment (Bribery Act) by the amending Act No. 20 of 1994.

11

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner. to his credit,

highlighted this serious anomaly in the Sinhala text of the said amending

Act which was brought in to substitute certain words in the principle

enactment.

Section 78 of the Bribery Act had undergone many a change since

its enactment in 1954, owing to the fact that different institutions were

empowered from time to time by the Legislature, to institute prosecution

in order to effectively eradicate the menace of bribery from our public life.

For convenience, it is proposed to consider the English text of Section 78(1)

as it existed before the amendment which was brought in by Act No. 20 of

1994.

Section 24 of the Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 9 of 1980, had

repealed Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act, in its entirety as it stood after the

amendment by Act No.2 of 1965.

The substituted Section 78(1) reads thus:

"No Magistrate's Court shall entertain any

prosecution for an offence under this Act except by or

with the written sanction of the Bribery Commissioner

or an officer authorised by him in that behalf"

Section 12 of the Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1994 amended

Section 78 "by the substitution for the words 'the Bribery Commissioner or an

officer authorised by him in that behalf of the words 'the Commission'.

12

In order to maintain visual clarity of the amendment, it is thought

that the consolidated Section 78(1), incorporating the said amendment

should be reproduced below in the following form.

"No Magistrate's Court shall entertain any

prosecution for an offence under this Act except by or

with the written sanction of the Eribery Cemmissiemr

er an efficer abltherised by him in that behalf the

Commission. "

This shows that there is no defect in the drafting of the English text

of the said Act, since the intention of the Parliament, with the legislative

changes it made to facilitate the responsibility of the State in prevention,

investigation and prosecution of activities involving bribery and

corruption. With the enactment of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994, that will of the

Parliament is clearly reflected in the relevant Sections of the Bribery Act as

well.

Learned President's Counsel, however pointed out an anomaly in

the relevant provisions of the Act in Sinhala text.

Before the amendment, in the text of section 78(1) states as follows;

"q~(gO (!OlJG:))Bo ClOClJ Cl8ro (!3Jj CllolOlJ6Cl Cl<;3JJ (!)~

Cl8ro Q)(gCl @~~ {g(i!j lil(gtlJBClCll ClM @3Jj q~(gcl

(!cOoQJJoI qGlOlO@l!lClol Cl8ci 3JJ03J~ @'!!)J{g(QlCl gCllCl"

13

Section 12 of the Sinhala text identified the words that are to be

substituted as follows:

"gOllll g~otilGlo 78 Cllll ClG'JllItilC3o "q@@c GlCl)lOlBc ClOc))GlGl GIro! 6 OC;rol 1iI~ Balli Ql@O C3C;lll @C;

ClOO qlC3t.3l tilOI/lllI 6 ClG'JllItilo 1/l0013ll1 OOI/l3l!OlllO Cl)o{!) @l1/lQ)".

At first glance, one finds that Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act as

amended by Act No. 09 of 1990 does not contain the words, that are sought

to be substituted by Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1994 and

highlighted by placing them within inverted commas, in that very form.

Instead it reads thus:

"q@@c l/lCl)lOlBc ClOOl Balli I/lro! OlolCl)l60 OC;rol 1iI~

Balli Ql@O C3C;{!) @Ii!) &i@olBOt1) Balli"

In the form introduced to Section 78(1) after Act No.9 of 1980, it is

seen that there are two instances where the reference to "Bribery

Commissioner" and also to "an officer authorised by him in that behalf"

were made but are presented in slightly different wording to each other.

Thus, it is clear that the substitution of the words "gOllll g~o6iGlo 78

Cllll ClG'JllItilGlo "q@@c GlCl)lOlBc ClOOlGlGl GIro! 6 OC;rol 1iI~ Balli Ql@O GlC;lll @C;

&i@OOOt1)GlGl" " to the words "q@@c GlCl)lOlOlBc ClOOl oalll GIro! OlolCl)l60 OC;rol 1iI~

Balli Ql@O GlC;{!) @Ii!) &i@olBot1) Balli" could not be carried out to a perfect

accuracy as if a clocksmith replaces a worn out part and replaces with a

new spare part, which fits perfectly into the void left by the worn out part.

In challenging the order of the Provincial High Court, learned

President's Counsel firstly contended that the order of the Provincial High

Court is based in the wording of the English text of the Bribery

14

(Amendment) Act and, whereas the same provisions in the amending Act

in Sinhala language, contained the already referred to serious anomaly in

the wording used by the Parliament, thereby giving the intended

amendment a totally different connotation. He also contended that the

Sinhala text takes precedence over its English version and therefore the

impugned order of the Provincial High Court is ex facie illegal.

Secondly he contended that with this legislative anomaly, the

amendment sought to be made by Act No. 20 of 1994 had become

meaningless and the Court should therefore revert back to the position

that prevailed before the Act No. 20 of 1994 was enacted, i.e. the provision

which reads:

"No Magistrate's Court shall entertain any

prosecution for an offence under this Act except by or

with the written sanction of the Bribery Commissioner

or an officer authorised by him in that behalf"

In support of his argument, the learned President's Counsel

submitted that Courts, when interpreting statutes will not step into the

Legislature's role and fill 'gaps' in Statutes. He cited the judgment of

Magor and St Mel/ons Rural District Council v Newport Corporation

[1951] 2 AER 839, Jinadasa v Hemamali (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 300, Suffragam

Rubber and Tea Co. Ltd v Mushin 55 N.L.R. 44, Liquidator, RVDB v

Hendrick (1997) 3 Sri L.R. 236 and AttoTlleJ} General v Sumathipala (2006)

2 Sri L.R. 126 in support of his contention.

Conh'ary submissions were made by the learned Senior State

Counsel who contended that the "only purposive interpretation that can

15

be given effect the h'ue intention of the Legislature is that S.12 of Act No.

20 of 1994 refers to whole Section .78 but not only Section 78(1) and thus, it

has substituted both segments in sub section referring to the "Bribery

Commissioner" with the "Commission" that falls in line with the English

and Tamil versions of the Act.".

He relied on the judgments of Seaford Court Estates Ltd v Asher

[1949]2 AllER 155, Mercantile Credit Ltd v Jayathilake and Others(1993) 2

Sri L.R. 418 and Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes (8th Ed) in support of his

argument of adopting a purposive interpretation of Section 78(1) which is

in line with the spirit of the Bribery Act as well as Act No. 19 of 1994.

In the preceding paragraphs of this order, the obvious anomaly in

the Sinhala text as it appear in the wording of Section 24 of Act No.9 of

1980, was considered and identified. It is clear that Section 78(1) after the

substitution of the words U@tlllS<!!>rn OCDl@~U leaves another reference to the

Bribery Commissioner in that Section and thereby rendering the meaning

of the amended Section hard to decipher as it fails to offer a meaningful

and grammatically correct full sentence as the resultant amended law as

seen from the following:

uq~(Scl @tlllOlBcl OOOl Cl8rn @CDj Cllcltlll~O O<;CDl 001;9 Cl8rn Q)(SO @~-:!) CSliil &\(SG:))Bo~ Cl8m @CDj ~

16

It is in this context that the learned President's Counsel referred to

the judgments where the English Courts, when presented with such an

issue on interpreting statutes, decided that it should not step into the

Legislature's role to fill in the 'gaps' in Statutes and therefore, urges that

this Court adopts his contention that the statutory provisions contained in

Section 78(1), as it stood before the Act No. 20 of 1994 was enacted, should

be given effect to in spite of the said amendment. Thus, it is the Bribery

Commissioner, who should be taken as the authority who is vested with

the authority who was empowered to sanction a prosecution under Section

78(1).

In the judgment of Magar and St Mellons Rural District Council v

Newport Corporation (supra), cited by the Petitioner contains the view

expressed by Lord Simonds having taken a different approach to the one

taken by Lord Denning in Seaford Court Estates Ltd v Asher (supra), an

authority relied upon by the Respondent.

Lord Simonds, referring to the approach of Lord Denning, in the said

judgment states that it could not be supported since:

"It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the

legislative function under the thin disguise of

interpretation and it is the less justifiable when it is

guesswork with what material the legislature would, if

it had discovered the gap, have filled in. If a gap is

disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act."

In Suffragam Rubber and Tea Co. Ltd v Mushin (supra), another

authority cited by the Petitioner, the Court followed Magar and St Mellons

17

Rural District Council v Newport Corporation (supra) and stated its view

that:

"In the construction of a statute, 'the duty of Court' -

and a fortiori the duty of the tribunal created by the

statute' is limited to interpreting the words used by

the Legislature, and it has no power to fill in any gaps

disclosed.

However, Lord Morton, in Magor and St Mellons Rural District

Council v Newport Corporation(supra), expressed his view (at p. 846 C)

more in line with the one held by Lord Denning:

"We sit here to find out the intention of the

Parliament and the Ministers and carry it out, and we

do this better by filling in the gaps and making sense of

the enactment than opening it up to destructive

analysis. "

What has been discouraged by their Lordships is adopting an

approach that would (at p.847 B) " ... defeat the Minister's intention by

giving an ultra-legalistic interpretation ... or to pull the language of the Act ... to

pieces, or to make nonsense of them."

The view expressed by Lord Denning in Seaford Court Estates Ltd v

Asher (supra) is as follows:

"Whenever a statute comes up for consideration it

must be remembered that it is not within human

18

powers to foresee the manifold sets of facts which may

arise, and, even if it were, it is not possible to provide

for them in terms free from all ambiguity. The English

language is not an instrument of mathematical

precision. Our literature would be much the poorer if

it were. This is where the draftsmen of Acts of

Parliament have often been unfairly criticized. A

judge, believing himself to be fettered by the supposed

rule that he must look to the language and nothing

else, laments that the draftsmen have not provided for

this or that, or have been guilty of some or other

ambiguity. It would certainly save the judges trouble if

Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine prescience

and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a defect

appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and

blame the draftsman. He must set to work on the

constructive task of finding the intention of

Parliament, and he must do this not only from the

language of the statute, but also from a consideration

of the social conditions which gave rise to it, and of the

mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he

must supplement the written word so as to give "force

and life" to the intention of the legislature. That was

clearly laid down by the resolution of the judges in

Heydon's case, and it is the safest guide to-day. Good

practical advice on the subject was given about the

same time by Plowden in his second volume Eyston v

19

Studd. Put into homely metaphor it is this: A judge

should ask himself the question: If the makers of the

Act had themselves come across this ruck in the

texture of it, how would they have straightened it out?

He must then do as they would have done. A judge

must not alter the material of which it is woven, but he

can and should iron au t the creases."

Lord Denning cited Heydon's Case [1584] EWHC Exch J36,

where Lord Coke laid down the mischief rule in interpretation of

statutes as follows:

"For the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in

general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or

enlarging of the common law), four things are to be

discerned and considered: (lst). What was the common

law before the making of the Act? (2nd). What was the

mischief and defect for which the common law did not

provide. (3rd). What remedy the Parliament hath

resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the

commonwealth. And, (4th). The true reason of the

remedy; and then the office of all the judges is always

to make such construction as shall suppress the

mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress

subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the

mischief, and pro privata commodo, and to add force

20

and life to the cu re and remedy, according to the true

in ten t of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico.'

In AG v Hale 53 NLR 289, Mowjood v Pussedeniya (1987) 1 Sri L.R.

63, Science House (Ceylon) Ltd v [PCA Laboratories (Pvt.) Ltd (1987) 1 Sri

L.R. 185, the view expressed by Lord Denning in Seaford Court Estates Ltd

v Asher (supra), was adopted and followed.

Maxwell, on The Interpretation of Statues (12th Ed, at p.228), under

the heading "Exceptional Construction" identifies the exceptions to the

rule highlighted by Lord Morton, in Magor and St Mellons Rural District

Council v Newport Corporation (supra) as he states:

"Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary

meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a

manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the

enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity

which can hardly have been intended, a construction

may be put upon it which modifies the meaning o(the

words and even the structure of the sentence"

(emphasis added).

He further states:

"What is, then being discussed here are the instances

in which the Court will depart from the literal rule.

Such instances are, however, exceptional and it is

impossible to lay down any categories of cases in which

ordinary grammatical interpretation will inevitably be

abandoned: the Courts are venJ reluctant to substitute

21

words in a statute or to add words to it" (emphasis

added).

At p. 230, Maxwell adds that "Just as the Court will occasionally fill

omission, so it will sometimes-contrary to the general principle that effect

must be given to every word in the statute-read a section, and while doing

so ignore certain words (emphasis added). He cites Clapham v National

Assistance Board [1961] 2 Q.B.77 where Lord Parker CJ has said the words

of Section 44(3) of the National Assistance Act 1948, "in any proceedings

on an application under the last foregOing subsection" should be read as

meaning "in any proceeding arising out of an application" etc by insertion

of the words 'arising out of into the text and also by deletion of the word

'on', from the text of the said section.

Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes (9th Ed) at p. 279, under the title

of U Anomaly", states thus:

"Although, it is one of the recognised cannons of

interpretation of statutes that the words used in a

statute should normally be given their plain ordinary

meaning, if such a method of interpretation leads to

manifest anomaly and is calculated to defeat the

professed and declared intention of the Legislature, it

is proper for the Courts to give a go-by to the rule

mentioned above and to interpret the words used as to

give effect to the intention of the Legislature. That

could be done of necessary even by modification of the

language used. The Legislators do not always deal with

specific controversies which the Courts decide. They

22

incorporate general purpose behind the statutory

words and it is for the Court to decide a specific issue.

If a given case is well within the general purpose of the

legislation but not within the literal meaning of the

statute, then the Court must strike the balance."

Learned author, then reemphasises the said principle (at p.342) in

following terms:

"It is equally the duty of the Court to accept a

contention which promotes the object and for that

purpose the Court can go beyond the language in order

to give effect to the intention of the Legislature. The

Court has to discharge the onerous duty of

ascertaining the intention of the lawmaker which may

be obscure due to errors in draftsmanship. Statutes

must not be construed in a manner leading to absurd

results defeating the legislative intent."

Thus, it is clear that there are exceptions even to the rule of

interpretation that Courts should attribute literal meaning to a statute and

not legislate by filling the gaps in Statutes, since the authorities and the

learned text writers permit even to modify the meaning of the words and

the structure of the sentence, to substitute words in a statute or to add

words or to ignore certain words, in giving effect to the intended meaning

of the lawmaker, if and when the reading of distorted text in a statute

leading to absurdity.

23

When one peruses the Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1994, it is

clear that the purpose of the amended Act is to enact certain legislative

provisions in relation to procedural aspects of bribery investigations and

prosecutions as well as, more importantly, to remove the many references

that are contained in the principle enactment to the office of Bribery

Commissioner and to substitute them with the references to the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption.

Section 3 of Act No. 20 of 1994 substituted references to the Bribery

Commissioner in Section 23A(4) of the principle enactment with the

Commission. Similarly, such substitutions to the references of the Bribery

Commissioner found in sections 71(4), 73(1)(a) and 81(1) of the principle

enactment were substituted with term "the Commission" by the said Act, a

clear indication of the Legislative intent of replacing the now defunct office

of the Bribery Commissioner with tl1e newly created entity, so that the

Bribery Act reflects the comprehensive changes the Parliament had made

the prevention, investigation and prosecution of bribery and corruption by

the enactment of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and

Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994. It is relevant to note that this Act No. 19 of

1994 which created the Commission, was certified by the Hon. Speaker on

the same day with Bribery (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1994, on 27th

October 1994.

In view of such clear legislative intent, the obvious anomaly that had

resulted in the Sinhala text of the Act No. 20 of 1994, qualifies to be termed

as an instance where, if constructed on the lines the Petitioner strongly

suggests, would lead to "absurd results defeating the legislative intent" and

thereby warranting intervention of this Court by adopting an "exceptional

24

construction" in interpreting Sinhala text of the amendment brought about

by section 12 of Act No. 20 of 1994 to section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

The situation that is perfectly in line with the learned President's

Counsel's submission that Courts will not fill gaps in legislation, arose for

consideration before Gratiaen J, in Tennekoon v Dissanayake 50 NLR 403.

At this point of time in history there was no Bribery Act in operation and

as such the prosecutions were instituted under the provision of the Penal

Code, the only piece of legislation by which acts of bribery were

criminalised. Noting the legislative inadequacy in dealing with the

situation that arose for determination before the then Supreme Court, it

was held as follows:

"This case illustrates the unsatisfactory state of the

law in Ceylon: relating to bribery. The provisions of

the Penal Code are not always wide enough to deal

with the iniquity of persons attempting by improper

means to influence the actions and decisions of public

servants. It is not surprising that this is so. Chapter 9

of the Code was adopted in this country from the

corresponding provisions of the Indian Penal Code of

1860, the final draft of which had been completed by its

distinguished author in 1837. At that time the law

aimed principally at the taker and not at the giver of

bribes, because " the giver was so often found to be a

person struggling against oppression by the taker.

" (Law Quarterly Review, Volume 60, at page 46). For

this reason, it was not thought necessary to introduce

25

a substantive section directly prohibiting persons from

giving or offering bribes to public officials, such

conduct being caught up, if possible, by the somewhat

circuitous application of the law dealing with

abetment. In spite of the mischievous changes which

have since taken place, the law which was conceived

over a century ago still stands unamended. That is of

course a matter for the consideration of the Legislature.

In the meantime, the plain meaning of the language of

an antiquated enactment cannot be given an extended

judicial interpretation so as to cope with modern

methods of corruption."

This judgment was pronounced on 8th December 1948, and the

Bribery Act was passed by Parliament in 1954 with the certification by the

Hon. Speaker on 1st March 1954. The situation that has now arisen before

this Court cannot be equated to the one before Gratiaen J and could

clearly be termed as one which justifies requiring "Exceptional

Construction" as Maxwell recognises.

Having carefully considered the submissions of the Counsel and the

applicable rules of interpretation, this Court therefore decides to interpret

the Sinhala text of the amendment brought by Act No. 20 of 1994 to

Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act, to read as follows:

"(Otl))~<!Mi ClCO)Cl 08.!D (Ocoi (Otl))~<!Mi ClCO)(Ot) 1Q\Cl)

q.:!)i!JCl)O q l 61Cl (Ocoi (0'" OlDCl) OCl@oi ~ Cl6~oi

26

In doing so, this Court had omitted the repetitive reference to the

words 'Bribery Commissioner' and 'an officer authorised by him on that

behalf' with its slightly different wording to the wording that appears in

the principle enactment, to bring about a harmonized text that reflects the

obvious legislative intent in bringing the amendment. The amendment

does not speak of the number of references to the Bribery Commissioner in

its text. The reasonable intent that could be attributable to the Legislature

in bringing the amendment is then to substitute all references in Section

78(1) to Bribery Commissioner with the word 'Commission'.

Having decided the wording of the Sinhala text of Section 78(1) of

the Bribery Act (as amended) this Court would now consider the primary

dispute of the parties, namely the question of sanction.

To impress upon the requirement of a sanction, learned President's

Counsel relied on a hypothetical but a realistic situation that could arise in

the powers exercised by several entities that are established under the

provisions of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and

Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994. He is apprehensive that there might arise a

situation where "an errant Director General acting contrary to the

Commissions directions" institutes proceedings before the Magistrate's

Court.

Learned Senior State Counsel, in his submissions stated that the

prosecution against the Petitioner was not instituted upon a "private

plaint" by the Director General but in the capacity of a public officer. He

further contended that the "necessity of a written sanction, on a cursory glance 27

is to discourage persons other than the respective authorities empowered to

institute such proceedings with a view to exclude vexatious complaints".

Having stated the reasons for the requirement for sanction, he

further adds, in relation to the instant matter:

"The case has been investigated by the official

authorized to conduct investigations on behalf of the

Commission. The investigation, as in other cases as

well, subjected to direct superVIsIOn of the

Commission. Having considered the material placed

before it the Commission has taken the decision to

institute proceedings in the Magistrates Court"

(emphasis original).

Making a reference to these submissions made by the parties had

presented an opportunity for this Court to ponder over the question as to

why a sanction is imposed by the Legislature, as a necessary precondition,

to institute criminal proceedings in respect of certain type of offences.

Learned Senior State Counsel had identified several such instances

that are found in the statutes, other than the Bribery Act, and drew

attention to Section 147(2) of the Customs Ordinance, Section 23 of the

Public Security Ordinance, Section 52 of the Excise Ordinance and Section

47 of the Tea Control Act.

He also cited the following quotation from Vol. 1, page 281 from the

authoritative text of R.F. Dias, A Commentary on the Ce1Jlon Criminal

Procedure Code.

28

"Any private person is at liberhj to initiate criminal

proceedings ... Legislature intervenes and imposes a

fetter upon this unrestricted right of the subject, by

requiring him, in certain cases, to obtain the sanction

of some public officer or Court before commencing a

prosecution. The object of such legislation is huofold,

viz, (i) to prevent the process of the Criminal Courts

from being prostituted for the purpose of harassing an

enemy by way of revenge, and (ii) to enable the

authorities to discourage false and vexatious cases, and

to keep under control the number of prosecutions, by

requiring some public officer or Court to examine the

facts of the case before a prosecu tion is sanctioned."

No doubt, the commentary of the learned author provides an

invaluable insight in relation to the rationale behind the imposition of a

sanction in instituting certain prosecutions. The Code of Criminal

Procedure which had governed the procedural aspect of investigations

and trials nevertheless had placed necessary saieguards to protect the

interests of the persons who are suspected and accused of committing

offences.

R.K.w. Goonesekere in his book titled Bribery, A study in law

making and of criminal process, makes an interesting observation in this

regard in the following manner ( at p. 77) :

29

"Complaints of bribery have to be treated cautiously.

On the one hand the Bribery Department would like to

receive as many complaints as possible from persons

who have given bribes in the past, from others from

whom bribes have been solicited, and even from

persons claiming to have 'good' second-hand

information. On the other hand, it cannot be

overlooked that to make an allegation of bribery can be

an easy way of taking revenge on one's personal and

political enemies. The problem is how the law is to deal

with the false complaint firmly and at the same time to

bring the genuine information into the open. To begin

with it was natural that the complaints should be

encouraged and therefore the Bribery Act gave

protection to informants. The bribe-giver, also an

offender under the Act, was safeguarded from

prosecution by s.78(4) which made the Attorney-

General's written sanction necessary for any criminal

prosecution against him. Complainants also had to fear

that if the accused was acquitted they ran the risk of a

civil action being brought against them. This too was

countered by requiring the Attorney General's written

sanction for the institution of any civil proceedings

against a complainant (s.78(4)). But in order that a

wronged person might have redress against a false and

mischievous allegation of bribery it was provided that

the Attorney-General' s sanction was not necessary for

30

a civil action if the District Judge who heard the case

certified that in his opinion the complainant had

wilfully and with intent to harm made a false or

frivolous allegation of bribery (s.27). In this way the

Act tried to strike a balance between competing

interests, perhaps, not too successfully because s.78( 4)

was repealed by the BribenJ (Amendment) Law No. 38

ofI974."

Observations made by the learned author of the above quoted text

further strengthens the requirement to have the prerequisite of a sanction

in initiating a prosecution since it had also been observed "that the general

procedural law does not apply to bribery investigations" (at p.SO). The

amendments brought about by the Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment)

No.3 of 2019, where the Commission was empowered to institute criminal

proceedings "on a consideration of material collected in the course of an

investigation of inquiry as the case may be by a Commission of Inquiry

appointed under Section 2" of the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter

393) adds another dimension. It is clear that the amendment was brought

in with the high ideal of strengthening the fight against bribery and

corruption. But the Courts will have to maintain a balance between the

purpose oriented legislation and the legal safeguards that had been

afforded to an individ ual.

In Bereton v Ratranhamy 19 c.L.W. 11, the Court attributed the

necessity of the sanction to prevent frivolous and vexatious prosecutions.

Atapattu v Punchi Banda 40 N.L.R. 169 also expressed a similar view. The

31

Court of Appeal divisional bench in Wijesiri v The Attorney General

(1980) 2 Sri L.R. 317, has stated that:

"The objects and reasons for the requirement of the

Attorney General's" sanction" set out in Section 147

of the Old Code (which is the counterpart of Section

135 of the New Code) are set out in Dias

Commentary on the Ceylon Criminal Procedure

Code at. p. 381, where the learned author states:

"the object of such legislation is two-fold, VIZ

(1) to prevent the process of the Criminal

Courts from being prostituted for the purpose of

harassing an enemy by way of revenge or out of

spite, and (ii) to enable the authorities to

discourage false and vexatious cases, and to

keep under control the number of prosecutions

by requiring some public officer or Court to

examine the facts of the case before a

prosecution is sanctioned. Such legislation is a

'precautionary measure, in order to prevent

frivolous or otherwise undesirable proceedings

by private persons".

The judgment of The Attorney General v William 57 N.L.R. 9, is in

relation to a prosecution for an offence under the Bribery Act. When the

question arose as to the jurisdiction of Court which had accepted an

indictment without the signature of the Attorney General himself, under

32

Section 78(1), their Lordships have added another important consideration

in their judgment as to the reasons for the imposition of such a

precondition by way of a sanction. The Court declared that:

"Some of the powers conferred on the Attorney

General are of such magnitude that it was probably

considered necessary tha t they should be exercised by

him and him alone to ensure that his judgment and

decision will serve as a guarantee that those powers

would be properly exercised. "

This rationale was echoed by the apex Court recently in Polwatte v

Jayawickrama and Others - S.c. Writ application No. 1/2011 - decided on

26.07.2018. Their Lordships, having considered the issue raised by the

Petitioner that the Commission had ceased to function due to expired of

its term of appointment, decided that" ... as for the exercise of functions such

as direction to be given to the Director General, it is crystal clear that the Act has

not provided for one member alone to give such direction" and as such it was

held that" ... there is no valid directive made under section 11 of the Act to

institute criminal proceedings before the Magistrates Court ... ". This

determination by the Supreme Court, therefore lays down a view, contrary

to that taken by the Court of Appeal on the point in Gunawardene v Nelum

Gamage, c.A. (PHC) APN. 385/2004 - decided on 12. 06. 2006.

33

Dias, in his commentary refers to the criterion under which a

sanctioning authority should consider grant of sanction (at p. 283 - also

cited by the Respondent) :

"Sanction to prosecute should only be given with the

object that the ends of justice may be served, and not in

order to assist private persons to harass their

opponents. No sanction ought to be given unless a

prima facie case is made out, or unless there exists a

reasonable a chance of a conviction following the

prosecu tion. Great care and circumspection should be

observed in granting sanctions so that it might not be

used by the person to whom it had granted as a

weapon of oppression, or for purpose of blackmail.

Section 147(4) declares that a sanction, once given,

lapses after six months from the date it is given."

Section 78(1) required the sanction to be in written form. The

provisions speaks of a "written sanction". However, no particular

reference was made in the statutory provisions contained in the said

section of the format to be followed by the sanctioning authority in issuing

such a sanction.

However, there is guidance, in relation to the format in which a

sanction should be granted, that has been offered in Shoni's Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973 (18th Ed) Vol. 3, p.2059, in line with the

provisions of the Indian Code.

34

" It is plainly desirable that the facts should be referred

to on the face of the sanction, but this is not essential

since the section does not require the sanction to be in

particular form, nor even to be in writing ... The

desirability of such a course is obvious, because when

the facts are not set out in the sanction, proof has to be

given 'aliunde' that sanction was given in respect of

the facts constituting the offence charged, though an

omission to do so is not fatal so long as the facts can

be, and are, proved in some other way."

With the consideration of the reasons as to the imposition of a

sanction as a prerequisite to institute prosecution under Section 78(1) of

the Bribery Act, it is appropriate to consider the core issue that had been

presented before this Court at this stage.

Having considered the importance of the sanction as a pre requisite

for a prosecution, this Court must now endeavour to deal with the

following issues,

a. what is the entity, which had been invested with the authority

with the sanctioning a prosecution under section 78(1) of the

Bribery Act?

b. whether that entity had in fact granted its sanction to launch the

prosecution against the Petitioner and other Accused

Respondents?

35

The issue regarding the entity, which had been invested with the

authority with the sanctioning a prosecution under section 78(1) of the

Bribery Act needs no detailed discussion as Section 78(1) itself is clear that

it is the Commission itself and no other. There is no dispute about this

legal position between the Petitioner (subject to his submission of the

legislative anomaly) and Respondent.

The most contentious issue between the parties was therefore

whether the Commission had sanctioned the prosecution that had been

initiated by the Respondent citing the Petitioner and several others as

accused which is now pending before the Magistrate's Court of Colombo.

In his submissions, the Respondent concedes that there is no written

sanction by the Commission in this instance. His position is that since this

prosecution was initiated by the Respondent on behalf of the Commission

as per its direction, the prosecution ought to be considered as a

prosecution instituted "by" the Commission and therefore issuance of a

written sanction would be quite superfluous. He hinges his argument on

the factual position that, in the plaint addressed to the Magistrate's Court

which had been tendered under Respondent's signature, it is clearly stated

that the facts are reported under 136(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, upon a direction by the Commission to the

Respondent under Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations

of Bribery and Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994. Based on this fact, learned

Senior State Counsel further submits that accordingly it ought to be treated

36

as a prosecution that had been initiated "by" the Commission, which need

not sanction a prosecution which itself had initiated.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner sought to counter this

contention by placing total reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court

in Senanayake v The Attorney General (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 149. It is a case

where the apex Court had decided the issue, whether the failure to name

the Respondent, who was the Complainant in the Court below, as a

necessary party in the matter before it, violating Supreme Court Rules 4,

28(1) and 28(5), against the appellant. The appeal was dismissed by the

Supreme Court in limine on the said preliminary objection.

Learned Counsel highlighted the relevant portions of the said

judgment, where their Lordships have determined that:

"Considering the provisions contained is Sections 11

and 12 of the Act, No. 19 of 1994 it is quite obvious

that where the material received by the Commission to

investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, in

the course of an investigation conducted under and in

terms of the Act, No. 19 of 1994 discloses the

commission of an offence, the said Commission shall

direct the Director - General to institute criminal

proceedings against such person in the appropriate

Court. The said provisions also indicate, quite clearly

that when such a direction is given by the Commission

that it is mandatory for the Director-General to

37

institute proceedings. Furthermore, in terms of Section

12 of the Act, No. 19 of 1994, the indictment under the

hand of the Director-General is receivable in the High

Court.

It is therefore evident that the Director-General has to

be regarded as the complainant, as the authority to

institute criminal proceedings on the offences under

Act No. 19 of 1994, is exclusively vested with the

Director-General of the Commission."

In view of this determination, learned President's Counsel submits

that the Commission has no authority to institute a prosecution since that

power is "exclusively vested with the Director-General of the Commission" and

as such, the sanction of the Commission is a mandatory requirement and

its absence makes the pending prosecution against the Petitioner null and

void since he had objected to the assumption of jurisdiction of Court on

the said prosecution at the very outset.

It is advisable to remind the statutory provisions contained 111

Section 78(1) once more at this juncture. The section reads thus:

"No Magistrate's Court shall entertain any

prosecution for an offence under this Act except by or

with the written sanction of the Commission."

38

There is no dispute that the prosecution against the Petitioner is

under the Bribery Act. The words "entertain any prosecution" in the said

Section requires a little more consideration. The word "entertain" was

deliberately used by the Parliament for a reason. Dias, in his commentary

explains (Vol. 1, p. 284) the reason:

"When a charge needing sanction of a particular kind

of complaint is presented the Court may not "take

cognizance" of such charge and exercise jurisdiction

... unless such charge is supported by the necessary

sanction, or is preferred by a person lawfully entitled

to make the complaint."

Therefore, it appears that when facts are reported by the

Respondent, alleging commission of offences under the Bribery Act,

Section 78(1) requires the relevant Magistrate's Court, before it assumes

jurisdiction over such plaint, to satisfy itself as to whether it should take

cognizance of the matter by undertaking a verification that the statutory

prerequisites of a written sanction by the Commissioner is satisfied.

Then, the reference made by the learned Senior State Counsel to the

words "by or with the written sanction of the Commission" in Section

78(1) also needed consideration.

Plain reading of the words in section 78(1) indicate that" ... any

prosecution for an offence under this Act except by or with the written

39

sanction of the Commission" envisages two scenarios. Firstly, there could

be a situation where the prosecution is instituted "by" the Commission

itself. Secondly there could also be a situation where a prosecution was

initiated "with the written sanction of the Commission" by another entity.

It is common sense that if the prosecution is initiated by the Commission

itself then an imposition of an additional requirement, that there should

also be a written sanction, would be a superfluous exercise.

In fact, this is the reasoning in the judgment relied upon by the

Respondent. In Rodrigo v The Commission to Investigate Allegations of

BribenJ or Corruption - CA/PHC 57/2009 - decided on 10.11.2010, it was

held by the Court of Appeal that:

"We are of the view that written sanction in this

instance would unnecessarily obstruct and delay the

smooth and harmonious working of the Bribery Act.

We are satisfied that the Commission has given

direction to institute proceedings in the relevant

Court. As such written sanction contemplated by the

Appellant would be superfluous."

Learned President's Counsel submits that this judgment is against

the weight of the judicial precedents and the relevant statutory provisions

and therefore had been decided per incuriam.

This judgment was pronounced on 10.11.2010. The Supreme Court

pronounced its judgment in Senanayake v The Attorney General (supra),

26 days later on 06.12.2010. Therefore, their Lordships did not have the

benefit of the determination of the Supreme Court on the powers and

40

functions of the Commission in comparison to the functions and powers of

the Director General at the time of their determination in Rodrigo v The

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corn/ption (supra).

Their Lordships determination that "written sanction in this instance

would unnecessarily obstn/ct and delay the smooth and harmonious working of the

Bribery Act" is apparently based on the acceptance of the proposition that

the prosecution is instituted "by" the Commission itself as per Section 78(1)

in that particular instance.

But this determination, when viewed in the light of the subsequent

pronouncement of the Supreme Court, is in direct conflict with the view

held by the apex Court that" ... the authority to institute criminal proceedings

on the offences under Act No. 19 of 1994, is exclusively vested with the Director-

General of the Commission".

The Supreme Court further added that:

"An examination of the aforementioned provisions of

the Act, No. 19 of 1994, reveals that, the functions of

the Commission are restricted to investigating

allegations and directing the institution of

proceedings. It is also evident that on the material

received by the Commission in the course of an

investigation conducted by the Commission there is

disclosure of the commission of an offence, thereafter

the role of the Commission is only to direct the

Director-General to institute criminal proceedings and

the indictment would be signed by the Director-

41

General. The said procedure is clearly laid down in

Section 12(1) of Act, No. 19 of 1994, ... "

The provisions contained in Section 3 of the Act, No.

19 of 1994, further clarified this position. The said

Section 3 of the Act referred to earlier, deals with the

functions of the Commission and clearly states that the

functions of the Commission are limited to investigate

allegations and to direct the institution of proceeding

against such person.

A careful examination of the provisions in Section 3

and 11, thus clearly indicates that, whilst the

Commission has the authority to investigate, and on

the basis of the findings of such investigation, the

Commission has the authority to direct the institution

of proceedings, such institution of proceedings shall be

carried out in effect by the Director- General of the

Commission. "

The determination of the Supreme Court on the powers and

functions of the Commission and Director General in Senanayake v The

Attorney General (supra) is a binding authority on all other Courts on

application of the principle of Stare decisis, until and unless changed by the

Supreme Court itself or the Parliament.

Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that, with the

pronouncements made by the Supreme Court in Senanayake v The

Attorney General (supra), the proposition that a prosecution under Bribery

42

Act could be instituted "by" the Commission itself as per Section 78(1)

could no longer be considered as a legally valid statement. In the

circumstances, with due respect to the submissions of the learned Senior

State Counsel, this Court rejects his submission on this point as it runs

contrary to the above referred determination of the apex Court.

The resultant position then is that there should be a written sanction

issued by the Commission for a Magistrate's Court to entertain a

prosecution instituted under the Bribery Act.

It is an admitted fact that there is no written sanction by the

Commission. The Petitioner has highlighted the fact that the Respondent,

in her Statement of Objections, has "not even stated that sanction in terms

of section 78 has been obtained."

Since there is no provision contained in Section 3 of the Commission

to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994,

permitting the Commission to institute proceedings on its own, there is no

possibility that there could be a situation where the prosecution is

instituted "by" the Commission as contended by the learned Senior State

Counsel. Then the question whether the Commission had directed the

Respondent to institute criminal proceedings against a particular accused

or not, has no direct bearing in a situation where the Magistrate's Court

considers the issue whether to entertain a prosecution under Section 78(1).

Hence, the reliance placed by the Respondent, in her statement in the plaint

that the plaint is filed on the direction of the Commission against the

Petitioner becomes an irrelevant consideration under Section 78(1).

43

In view of the above, the position taken up by the Respondent, that

she was directed by the Commission to file plaint against the Petitioner is

purely an internal administrative arrangement between the Commission

and its Director General, which has no bearing to the question whether

there is written sanction by the Commission to institute prosecution

against the Petitioner, under section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

The only conclusion that could be reached in view of the above

considerations is that the prosecution pending before the Magistrate had

been instituted without the written sanction of the Commission and

thereby, without complying with the mandatory provisions contained in

section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

Then, what would be the effect of tills failure on the pending

prosecution against the Petitioner before the Magistrate's Court that had

been instituted without written sanction of the Commission?

The requirement of sanction was first introduced by Section 147 of

the Criminal Procedure Code (Ordinance No.15 of 1898) which made it a

condition precedent for the initiation of prosecutions for certain type of

offences. The Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, Section 116

imposed a similar precondition. Section 135 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 continued with this statutory limitation by

making the sanction by the Attorney General as a pre-condition to the

institution of proceedings in respect of the instances that are specified

therein as no Court could take cognisance of certain offences without it.

This Court already considered why this precondition was imposed

by the Parliament. The significance the Legislature has attached to this

44

provision and its obvious determination to continue with it, in spite of

creating a dedicated institution to deal with prevention, investigation and

prosecution of bribery and corruption, is evident with the passing of Act

No.20 of 1994, by which the requirement of a sanction is retained as a

statutory pre-condition. Given the importance attached to the sanction by

the Legislature, this Court must then consider the approach the Courts

have adopted when dealing with situations where prosecutions were

instituted without sanction when the law imposes such a requirement.

There had been instances where the Courts have treated absence of a

sanction as fatal to the proceedings before the original Court while there

are other instances where the Courts have treated such instances as curable

defects under Sections 425 of the old Code and 436 of Act No. 15 of 1979

respectively.

Section 436 specifically states that u . any judgment passed by a Court

of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or revision on

account ... of the want of any sanction required by section 135. U

In King v Harmanis 8 N.LR. 140, the Court held that a sanction is

necessary to prosecute the accused. The judgment of Atapattu v Punchi

Banda 40 N.L.R. 169, refers to an instance where the objection of no

sanction was taken belatedly. Whilst approving the Magistrate's decision

to proceed with the case, the Court held it had the power to act under

Section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code, if it is satisfied that the

irregulari ty had occasioned a fail ure of justice following the principle laid

down in Halliday v Kandasamy 14 N.L.R. 492 that Section 423 should only

apply when there was no objection raised to the jurisdiction of the Court.

45

In Silva v Razak 1 c.L.W. 213, it was decided that a Magistrate cannot

take cognizance of an offence except with the previous sanction of the

Attorney General.

However, a distinction is made to this particular approach in

Wickremaaratchi v Inspector of Police, Nittambuwa 71 NLR 121. It is a

matter where the prosecution was initiated under Section 14 of the

Conciliation Boards Act and an objection was taken only at the appeal that

a certificate of the board has been filed as required by law. Alles J stated as

follows:

"Section 425, inter alia, provided for the dismissal of

an appeal if any error, omission, irregularitlj or want

of sanction has not occasioned a failure of justice. The

absence of the certificate in this case, if it can be called

an irregularity, would be similar to the want of

sanction under section 147 of the Criminal Procedure

Code. It only relates to the exercise of jurisdiction by a

Magistrate's Court as distinct from the conferment of

jurisdiction and therefore would be curable under

section 425."

Moseley J, in Brereton v Ratranhamy 19 CLW 11, made the

distinction of cases where the want of sanction at the time of institution of

proceedings cannot be treated as a curable defects under Section 425.

However, it made the cases where the sanction was available, but defective

owing to some reason are curable with said section and restricted its

applicability only to prosecutions that qualify under Section 147."

46

His Lordship states thus:

U In regard to the omission to obtain the sanction of the

Attorney General, it is contended, I think properly,

that the object of this requirement is to protect private

persons from frivolous and vexatious prosecutions. In

Atapattu v Punchi Banda alias Nilame (13 CLW

73) the absence of sanction was held to be cured

inasmuch as no objection to want of sanction was

taken to the trial, and it must therefore be assumed

that the prosecution was neither frivolous or vexatious.

In the present case the sanction of the Tea Controller,

as provided by section 35(2) of Chapter 299 was

obtained. It may therefore be taken that the prosecution

was not frivolous or vexatious. The section of the

Criminal Procedure Code, however, by virtue of which

it is now sought to cure the omission to obtain the

sanction necessary to institute proceedings for an

offence against Ordinance No. 11 of 1933, is section

425 which provides that no judgment of a Court of

competent jurisdiction shall be reversed on appeal on

account, inter alia, of the want of any sanction

required by section 147, unless such want has

occasioned a failure of justice. I am satisfied that no

failure of justice has been occasioned in this case by the

omission to obtain the proper sanction, but the case is

not one of those embraced by section 147. No other

provision of law has been brought to my notice under

47

which this particular omlsszon might be cured. It

seems to me that in the absence of the required

sanction the trial is a nullihf"

In Perera v Inspector of Labour Matugama 50 N.L.R. 421,

Wijewardene J adopted the view:

"A defect in the sanction cannot be cured by the

application of the provisions of section 425 of the

Criminal Procedure Code"

Maymoon v Erasaratnam 68 NLR 331, is a judgment where Tambiah J had adopted a stricter approach as it was held that the initial defect of not

having the sanction could not be cured subsequently by the issuance of a

sanction. His Lordship states that:

"The provisions of Section 45 of the principal Act, as

amended by Act No. 68 of 1961, states categorically

that no prosecution for an offence under the

Immigrants and Emigrants Act could be instituted

except by the Controller or by a Police Officer of a rank

not below that of an Assistant Superintendent of

Police, or with the written sanction of the Controller or

such Police Officer. The words used are that without

the necessary sanction, no action can be instituted and

not that the prosecution cannot be proceeded with.

This prosecution was instituted without the necessary

sanction. Therefore, the learned Magistrate had no

jurisdiction to hear this case. A fatal defect of this kind

cannot be cured by the production of a certificate of a

48

later date. The attention of the learned Magistrate was

not brought to this fatal defect."

The judgment of Caldera v Wijewardene 65 NLR 211, delivered by

Sansoni J states thus:

"There is also a recent decision of the Supreme Court

of India in which the operation of section 537 was

considered, see Slaney v. State of Madhya Pradesk [A.

I. R. (1956) S. c. 116.]. Bose, j. expressed the view

that the trend of the more recent decisions of the Privy

Council, and indeed all later-day criminal juris-

prudence in England as well as in India, has been

away from technicality, to regard the substance rather

than the shadow, and to see whether even where there

has been a non-compliance with the provisions of the

Code there has actually been a failure of justice.

Chandrasekhera Aiyar, f. pointed out in that case that

the gravity of the defect will have to be considered-

whether it is a mere unimportant mistake in procedure

or whether it is substantial and vital. He said: " If it is

so grave that prejudice will necessarily be implied or

imported, it may be described as an illegality. If the

seriousness of the omission is of a lesser degree it will

be an irregularity, and prejudice by way of failure of

justice will have to be established." As instances of

illegalihJ he mentioned " lack of competency of

49

jurisdiction, absence of a complaint by the proper

person or authority specified, want of sanction

prescribed as a condition precedent for a prosecution,

in short, defects that strike at the very root of

jurisdiction. "

The judicial attitude on the question whether the defect in the

sanction is a curable one or not had been considered and decided clearly

by Samerawickrame and Wijayatilake JJ in the then Supreme Court whilst

delivering its judgment in Kanagarajah v the Queen 74 NLR 378. The

reasoning is quite important as that provides great insight in to the core

issue before this Court and therefore, it is appropriate that the judgment is

reproduced at length to retain its clarity in presentation:

"The express provision in s. 425 (b) prevents a

judgment being set aside on account of the want of any

sanction required by s. 147 of the Criminal Procedure

Code. The want of sanction required by s. 147 IS

therefore no more than an irregularity which IS

curable. The effect of the absence of sanction or

authority required by other provisions of the Code or

other laws has to be considered. In Brereton v.

Ratranhamy , 42 N. L. R. 149 Moseley, S.P.]., held

that the failure to obtain the sanction of the A ttorney-

General as required by Ordinance No. 11 of 1933 was

not curable under s. 425 of the Criminal Procedure

Code and rendered the proceedings a nullity. He said"

The section of the Criminal Procedure Code however

50

by virtue of which it is now sought to cure the

omission to obtain the sanction necessary to institute

proceedings for an offence against Ordinance No. 11 of

1933 is section 425 which provides that no judgment

of a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed

on appeal on account, inter alia, of want of any

sanction required by section 147, unless such want has

occasioned a failure of justice. 1 am satisfied that no

failure of justice has been occasioned in this case by the

omission to obtain the proper sanction but the case is

not one of those embraced by section 147. No other

provision of law has been brought to my notice under

which this particular omission might be cured. It

seems to me that in the absence of the required

sanction the trial is a nullity." In M. G. Perera v.

Inspector of Labour, Matugama 50 N. L.R. 421 , where

there was nothing to show that the sanction which was

in general terms referred to the particular charges

made in the report, Wijeyewardene C. J. said, " The

defect I have referred to cannot be cured by the

application of the provisions of section 425 (6), as that

section refers to a sanction required by section 147 of

the Code. Nor do 1 think it possible to have recourse to

section 36 of the Courts Ordinance. To do so would be

to extend the operation of section 425 (6) of the

Criminal Procedure Code, when the legislature itself

had restricted its scope by reference to sanctions under

51

section 147 of the Code (vide Bertram CJ, 's

observations in Cornelis Hamy v. Thoronis et al.-

(1924) 2 Times of Ceylon Law Reports 192.

In a long line of cases in india it has been held that

the absence of a complaint or sanction as required by

provisions like s. 82 (2) is a defect which vitiates the

proceedings and is not an irregularity curable under s.

537 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which was

almost identical with s. 425 of our Code. This view is

supported by decisions of the Privy Council and of the

Supreme Court of India.

In Gokulchand Divarkadas v. The King A. I. R. (1948)

P. C 82 at 85., Sir lohn Beaumont, delivering the

judgment of the Privy Council said, " it was not

disputed that if the sanction was invalid the trial

Court is not a court of competent jurisdiction .... For

the reasons above explained the sanction given was not

such a sanction as was required by c/. 23 of Cotton

Cloth and Yarn (Control) Order 1943 and was,

therefore, not a valid sanction. A defect in the

jurisdiction of the Court can never be cured under s.

537."

In Willie (Willaim) Slamey v. State of Madhya

Pradesh A.I.R. (1956) S.C 116 AT 135. Aiyar I.,

considering irregularities which may be cured under

52

s. 537 said, 'Of course, lack of competency of

jurisdiction, absence of a complaint by the proper

person or authority specified, want of sanction

prescri bed as a condition preceden t for a prosecu tion,

in short, defects which strike at the very root of

jurisdiction stand on a separate footing, and the

proceedings taken in disregard or disobedience would

be illegal."

Ramaswami, f., in the case of In re SubramaniamA. I.

R. 1954 S. C. 637. 149., said, II The 'want' of a

complaint as required by law will affect the

'competency' of a magistrate to deal with a case and is

not a curable error. The' want' of a sanction required

under any provision of law will similarly affect the

competency of the Court and is not curable under this

Section. But quite different would be irregularities in

sanctions granted and in such cases irregularities in

sanctions will be curable to the extent permissible

under s. 537 Cr. P. c."

Having considered and compared the judicial precedents,

Samerawickrame 1, in determining this vital issue, had laid down the

following important principle of law:

"Thus a sharp distinction is drawn between initiation

of proceedings without sanction as required by the

sections and irregularities in sanctions granted, the

former being a defect which vitiates the proceedings ab

53

initio and not an irregularity curable under s. 537 Cr.

P. C. and the latter sharing that of other irregularities

of a like nature being curable to the extent laid down in

s. 537 Cr. P. C. To sum up, want of sanction cannot be

cured but irregularities in sanctions can be cured. "

A similar view was echoed in a relatively recent judgment of this

Court in Appuhamy v Kesbewa Presdeshiya Sabhawa and Others (2007) 1

Sri L.R. 1, where acquittal in a Contempt of Court matter was challenged

without obtaining the sanction of the Attorney General, a statutory pre

requisite imposed by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. It

is held by Court that:

"Section 336 of Ordinance No. 15 of 1898, section

316(c) of 33 of 1973 and Section 318 of Act No. 15 of

1979, which deal with the qualification to lodge an

appeal against an acquittal by a Magistrate, except

with the written sanction of the Attorney-General, is

undoubtedly a restriction affecting the procedurallaw.

In my opinion, under no circumstances it can

constitute an integral part of the substantive

law.

In the circumstances, it would be seen that the judicial

precedents, relied upon by the appellant are unrelated

to the question that arises for determination in this

case. Based on the underlying principles, I am inclined

to endorse the view that the requirement laid down in

54

section 318 of the Court of Criminal Procedure Act,

No. 15 of 1979, is a procedural step. Hence, it is my

view that section 318 of the Code, is incapable of being

isolated from section 798 of the CPC and should

strictly be followed mutatis mutandis, in respect of

appeals against acquittals recorded by a District Judge.

As the appellant has admittedly failed to conform to

the 160 requirement of section 318 of the Code, the

pre/iminanj objection, raised by the accused is

upheld."

In Kanagarajah v the Queen (supra), the Court had referred to the

view of the neighbouring jurisdiction, India, and therefore for the sake of

completeness the views expressed in Shord's Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973 (18 111 Ed) Vol. 3, p. 2057, on this very issue are reproduced below:

"Sanction to prosecute constitutes a condition confers

jurisdiction on the Court to try the case; and where

there is no valid sanction, there is a defect in the

jurisdiction of the Court which can never be cured

under section 465. It is not permissible to look at the

ultimate result of the trial in order to examine whether

the Magistrate has taken legal cognizance of the case.

If a general power to take cognizance of an offence is

vested in a Court, any prohibition to the exercise of

that power, by any provision of law, must be confined

to the terms of the prohibition. In enacting a law

55

prohibiting the taking of cognizance of an offence by a

Court, unless certain conditions are complied with, the

Legislature does not purport to condone the offence. It

is primarily concerned to see that prosecution for

offences in case covered by the prohibition shall not

commence without complying with the condition

contained therein."

In a recent judgment, Nitinbhai Shah v State of Gujarat AIR 2002

SC III 2784, the Supreme Court of India stated that;

"Section 196(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

enjoins that 'no Court shall take cognizance of any

offence punishable under Chapter VI of the Indian

Penal Code, except with the previous sanction of the

Central Government or of the State Government'. The

sanction of the Government is thus a pre-condition for

the cognizance of the offences specified in various

clauses of 5.196."

However, in this particular instance, the apex Court of India refused

to intervene as their Lordships observed:

"Such a situation should not be permitted to happen

while exercising the jurisdiction under Art 136, more

so, when the petitioner inexplicably failed to raise the

objection at the earliest. Evidently he chose to raise

objections In piecemeal wi thout apparent

justification. "

56

The judicial attitude of the English Courts is no different to the ones

expressed in the judicial precedents already referred to above.

The Court of Appeal, in Regina v Welsh (Snr) & 17 Others [2015]

EWCA Crim 1516, considered the question "should the Attorney General's

consent to institute proceedings have been obtained before the preliminary

hearing in the Crown Court?". The Respondent (Crown) conceded that

consent was not obtained prior to the institution of proceedings.

Their Lordships have held that" ... the proceedings instituted before the

Attorney gave consent would (at least should) have been treated as a nullity by the

Crown Court, had the matter been raised prior to conviction. They would then

have been instituted properly and the convictions recorded and sentences imposed

exactly as they were."

This point is best illustrated in the judgment of Regina v CW & MM

[2015] EWCA Crim 906. Relevant portion of Section 4(2)(a) of the Criminal

Law Act 1977 reads" in relation to the institution of proceedings ... otherwise

than by, or on behalf or with the consent of, the Attorney General, ... ". The

question raised before the original Court was" should the Attorney General's

consent to institute proceedings have been obtained before the preliminary hearing

in the Crown Court ?".

Rejecting the submissions of the Respondent (Crown) that section 25

of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, in order to justify its failure, the

Court of Appeal had held:

"Certain steps during the conduct of a criminal case

must be taken. ft would risk an injustice were their

place in the chronologJJ to found, without more, a

57

,rr=============================================~

successfu I submission that proceedings were null and

void. That potential injustice is all section 25 seeks to

address, and by its language it does no more that

protect against the law of unintended consequences. It

does not provide an escape route which cures

deficiencies in the Crown's adherence to the terms of

section 4."

The appellate Court had endorsed the view taken by the Crown

Court on the objection taken on the issue of sanction as it is stated that "The

Judge was astute to the problems the Crown had created for itself and unmoved by

a last-ditch attempt to bend the language of section 25 to accommodate that

failure. "

All these precedents are on the question of sanction by the Attorney

General under section 135 of the Act No. 15 of 1979 or section 147 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure or such similar provisions.

In the judgment of Attorney General v William (supra), de Silva and

Sansoni IT have considered whether an indictment signed by a Crown

Counsel contravenes the requirements of sections 5, 6 and 78(1) of the

Bribery Act. Their Lordships have decided that:

"A preliminary objection was taken by their Counsel

based on S. 78 (1) of the Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954,

which reads: II No prosecution for any offence under

this Act shall be instituted in any Court except by, or

with the written sanction of, the Attorney-General ".

lt was contended that this prosecution had not been

58

instituted by the Attorney-General or with his written

sanction. The Act makes provision for the prosecution

of two classes of offences, namely, offences of bribery

and offences other than bribery, and these two classes

are dealt with in Part II and Part V respectively. The

offences with which the accused were charged fall

within Part JI, and all prosecutions for such offences

have to be institu ted by the Attorney-General.

"". the pointed references in the Act to certain duties

being performed by the Attorney-General alone, and

others being performed by him or officers authorised by

him, necessarily flow from the far-reaching nature of

certain of the powers conferred upon the Attorney-

General by the Act. It is only reasonable to presume

that the legislature designedly abstained from

conferring upon any officer but the Attorney-General

the right to exercise the more responsible powers

conferred upon the latter. it was not prepared to

permit the Attorney-General to delegate the power to

sanction civil or criminal proceedings. This is a power

which has to be exercised in connection with the

prosecution of offences other than bribery. It would not

be unreasonable to expect that the corresponding

power of indicting or arraigning, in the case of offences

of bribery, should be exercised by the Attorney-General

and nobody else, and it is not easy to see why the

legislature appears to have empowered the A ttorney-

59

.rr=======================================~

General by writing under his hand to delegate to the

Solicitor-General the power to indict, but not the

power to sanction civil or criminaL proceedings."

Thus, it is clear from the above analysis, that the local as well as

foreign jurisdictions have treated all instances where criminal proceedings

have been instituted without sanction of the authority that is empowered

to grant such sanctions, and if an objection is taken at the first available

opportunity, as an error that had adversely affected the assumption of

jurisdiction by the original Court and cannot be considered as a curable

defect by mitigating its effect on the operation of any other section which

was meant to cure other procedural irregularities which causes no

prejudice to the accused.

In this backdrop, this Court must now turn its attention to decide the

validity of the impugned orders pronounced by the Provincial High Court

and Magistrate's Court, in the light of above stated considerations.

It is evident from the order of the Magistrate's Court, that the

Original Court had treated the prosecution instituted by the Respondent

before it, actually as a prosecution instituted "by" the Commission itself

and therefore concluded that if a sanction is needed to approve the

prosecution that had already been instituted by the Commission on its

own, such a proposition would seem an absurd one. Then the Court had

accepted the reference made in the plaint, that Respondent had been

directed by the Commission to institute proceedings as a fact, that confirms

issuance of a direction to the Director General by the Commission under

Section 3 of the Act No. 19 of 1994.

60

In determining the validity of the preliminary objection raised by the

Petitioner, the Magistrate's Court had expressly relied on the reasoning of

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rodrigo v The Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (supra). When the order

of the Magistrate's Court was pronounced on 17.11.2017, the Supreme

Court had already decided the powers and functions of the Commission

and the Director General conferred by the provisions of the Act No. 19 of

1994, in Senanayake v The Attorney General (supra). However, the

original Court had failed to take into consideration that the Commission

on its own cannot institute proceedings and only had the power to direct

the Director General to do so. The Magistrate's Court also failed to note as

per the operative part of the Section 78(1), that it was to the Magistrate's

Court that the discretion under said Section was conferred on by the

Legislature to entertain prosecutions with the written sanction of the

Commission. Thus, the rejection of the preliminary objection to its

jurisdiction is clearly made upon arriving at erroneous conclusions as to

the functions and powers of the Commission.

In the order of the Provincial High Court, it had been observed by

the appellate Court that the Commission had no power to institute

prosecutions on its own but only had power to direct the Respondent to

do so. Nevertheless, the Provincial High Court endorses the view taken by

the Magistrate's Court that the prosecution pending before the lower Court

is a prosecution instituted "by" the Commission and therefore no sanction

is needed under Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

61

..

This Court, in view of the determination of the Supreme Court in

Senanayake v The Attorney General (supra) and the provisions contained

in Section 3 of the Act No. 19 of 1994, is of the view that prosecution "by"

the Commission, as per Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act, has now become

an obsolete or redundant function with no corresponding power being

conferred upon the Commission in this regard under the provisions of

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act No.

19 of 1994. The prosecution "by" the Commission is therefore clearly

legislative residue from Section 78(1) from the statutolY provisions that

existed before the amendments brought in by Act Nos. 19 and 20 of 1994,

with no corresponding power conferred on the Commission to institute

proceedings. In the circumstances, the orders of the Magistrate's Court and

the Provincial High Court are tainted with illegality and thereby subjected

to be interfered with by this Court in exercising its powers of revision.

Clearly this is not a situation where the provisions of Section 436 is

applicable since the assumption of jurisdiction is a fundamental legal issue

which could not be cured as a mere irregularity or illegality in view of

Kanagarajah v the Queen ( supra) and not qualified to be treated as an

instance where the prosecution has been instituted under Section 135 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

Therefore, this Court sets aside both the impugned orders and

quashes the pending criminal proceedings before the Magistrate's Court

for want of jurisdiction. The relevant Magistrate's Court is directed to

discharge the Petitioner and 2nd to 8th Accused-Respondents from the

proceedings of case No. 59287/01/16, forthwith.

62

,

This determination will not act as bar to initiate a criminal

prosecution afresh, if the Commission is of the view that the investigation

discloses the commission of an offence under the Bribery Act and directs

the Respondent to institute proceedings before the appropriate Court. If

that Court is the Magistrate's Court, then the Commission must sanction

the institution of such proceedings by a written communication to that

effect, addressed to that Court.

Application of the Petitioner is allowed. No costs ordered.
