Samayawardhena, J.

The house No. 5/1, Pelawatta Road, Nugegoda was vested in the

Commissioner of National Housing by order published in the

Gazette marked 1R1 dated 16.08.1985. This was done by the

1st respondent Commissioner of National Housing in terms of

section 8(4) of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law, No.1 of

1973, as amended.

At the time of vesting, Weerasekera was the tenant of the house

under Peiris Appuhamy. Both Peiris Appuhamy and

Weerasekera are now dead. The petitioner is a successor in title

of Peiris Appuhamy, and the 2nd-5th respondents are the heirs of

Weerasekera.

Adjoining to the said house No. 5/1 is the house No. 5 where

petitioner is living as the prominent owner. As seen from the

Plan P1 made in 1960 and the Preliminary Plan P9 made in

2007 for a partition action, both the premisesNo. 5 and No.

5/1are situated in the same corpus.

After the death of Peiris Appuhamy, intestate, there are several

co-owners to the land. Therefore, a partition action has been

filed by the widow of Peiris Appuhamy to partition the larger

land which included the abovementioned houses No. 5 and No.

5/1. As this partition action was filed after the house No. 5/1

was vested in the Commissioner of National Housing, the

Commissioner of National Housing has also been made a party

to it. That partition action has, as seen from P10, been

dismissed without proceeding to trial, on a preliminary question

of law, on 21.02.2013.

3

Thereafter the Commissioner of National Housing has, by

conveyance marked P12 dated 02.07.2013, transferred to

Weerasekara, the tenant, the house No. 5/1 together with the

land in extent 20.34 Perches. The Commissioner has identified

the aforesaid portion of land, as stated in the conveyance, by

way of the Preliminary Plan P9 prepared for the abortive

partition action.

It is this decision of the Commissioner in relation to the transfer

of land, not the house, which is being canvassed by the

petitioner in these proceedings.

Accordingly, the petitioner seeks to quash by way of writ of

certiorari the decision of the Commissioner to adopt the Plan P9

to identify the land to be transferred together with the house,

and to cancel by way of writ of mandamus the conveyance P12.

Section 16(1) of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law reads as

follows:

Where any house which is not a flat or a tenement is vested in

the Commissioner under this Law, there shall also be vested in

the Commissioner such extent of land and such rights as is or are

in the opinion of the Commissioner reasonably appurtenant to the

house.

It is common ground that before the Commissioner for National

Housing decided the extent of land which is reasonably

appurtenant to the house vested, the Commissioner did not hear

the petitioner and the other co-owners of the land. It is

important to remember that by Gazette Notification 1R1 only the

4

house No. 5/1 was vested with the Commissioner. No extent of

land, appurtenant to the house, properly identified by way of a

Plan, was vested with the Commissioner by it.

The determination of the extent of land reasonably appurtenant

to the house is an important determination, which directly

affects the rights of the co-owners of the land, particularly the

petitioner who is living in the adjoining land of the same corpus

as the prominent owner.

Under section 16(1), when the Commissioner forms an opinion

with regard to the extent of land reasonably appurtenant to the

house, he shall, in my view, give a hearing to the parties who

would be affected by his determination. He cannot decide that

important question affecting the proprietary rights of the true

owners of the property arbitrarily or by giving a hearing only to

the tenantthe prospective transferee.

The intention of this piece of legislation was not to give lands to

the tenants, but to give houses. If only the house is given, as it

is of no use, the legislature wanted to give an extent of land

reasonably appurtenant to the house.

It is the contention of the learned State Counsel for the

Commissioner of National Housing that the Preliminary Plan P9

prepared for the partition case was based on the old Plan P1

made in 1960, and therefore the Commissioner was not

unreasonable when he formed the opinion in relation to the

extent of land reasonably appurtenant to the house based on the

said Preliminary Plan P9.

5

I do not think that the Commissioner shall take a mechanical

approach in deciding the extent of land reasonably appurtenant

to the house.

At the time the partition action was filed, only the house No. 5/1

was vested with the Commissioner of National Housing. The

situation was the same when the partition action was dismissed

on a preliminary question of law. Hence, in the partition action,

the tenant Weerasekara or the Commissioner of National

Housing, could not have, as of right, successfully claimed the

entire Lot X in the Preliminary Plan P9. It is settled law that a

tenant cannot claim prescriptive title to a property without first

changing his character of possession.

When the Commissioner forms the opinion as to the extent of

land reasonably appurtenant to the house, he shall, in my view,

inter alia, consider the condition of the property at the time of

his forming the opinion.

The 2nd, 3rd and 5th respondents have apprehended some fear on

this matter and by paragraph 8 of their written submissions

voluntarily given an explanation in advance regarding the access

road to house No. 5/1 which is part of Lot X in the Preliminary

Plan in the following manner:

The plan based on which the said conveyance marked P12

was prepared is plan No.2579 marked P9 and the sole

access to the premises in question is the access from

Palawatte Road over lot Z and the appurtenant land given

up to lot Z and if lot Z is not given these respondents find it

impossible to enter their own house as Cooray Road is a

6

completely independent road nothing to do with the

property in question and the said preliminary plan 2579

makes it clear that there is a clear boundary separating

premises No.5/1 from the Cooray Road.

This provides an example of the matters the Commissioner shall

take into account when deciding the extent of land reasonably

appurtenant to the house.

If I may make my own observations, in the old Plan made in

1960 marked P1, the northern boundary of the Lot where house

No. 5/1 is situated is Property of D.J. Cooray and therefore the

only access road to house No. 5/1 had been from Pelawatta

Road in the south. But, when the Preliminary Plan P9 was

prepared for the partition case in 2007, the northern boundary

of the Lot where house No. 5/1 is situated is a road known as

Cooray Place. That is a relevant factor to be taken into

account by the Commissioner in deciding the extent of land

reasonably appurtenant to the house.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn attention of this

Court to section 20 of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law to

state that the Commissioner has not followed the mandatory

provisions of the Law in determining the question of the extent

of land as is reasonably appurtenant to the house. In my view,

section 20 is not applicable as it relates to Notice to persons

entitled to make claims to the price payable in respect of any

vested house. In short, it relates to monetary claims in respect

of houses vested. That matter has not been put in issue in this

application. In this application, what has been put in issue is

7

the question of the extent of land as is reasonably appurtenant

to the house.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd, 3rd and 5th respondents

has raised two preliminary objections to the maintainability of

this application. As it has been emphasized even in the written

submissions, I must deal with them.

One relates to acquiescence. In paragraph 3(a) of the written

submissions learned Presidents Counsel states that although

the petitioner to this application was a party to the partition

action, she never objected to the appurtenant land possessed by

Weerasekara as depicted in the Preliminary Plan. I cannot

understand the point of argument. In partition actions, parties

do not ordinarily object to the Preliminary Plans prepared by

Court Commissioners. Those Preliminary Plans represent the

current status of the land to be partitioned in situ. The

petitioner does not dispute the Preliminary Plan. But it does not

mean that at the end of the trial, the Judge will partition the

land as depicted in the Preliminary Plan. I reject that

preliminary objection.

The second preliminary objection relates to laches. The learned

Presidents Counsel states that conveyance P12 is dated

02.07.2013, but the petitioner came to Court on 02.09.2015,

and therefore application shall be dismissed in limine due to

delay. It is the position of the petitioner that she was not aware

of the aforesaid conveyance until she complained to the police

against Weerasekara for surveying the land without any

authority. It is at that inquiry, Weerasekra has told the police

8

that he surveyed the land according to the conveyance P12 given

by the Commissioner of National Housing. The petitioner has

explained the delay.

This leads me to deal with another important matter, which

vitiates the decision of the Commissioner of National Housing.

After the Commissioner of National Housing took the impugned

decision ex parte, it was incumbent on his part to communicate

it to the persons adversely affected by it, especially the

petitioner. According to section 39(1) of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law, Any person aggrieved by any decision or

determination made by the Commissioner under this Law may,

within one month of the date on which such determination is

communicated to such person, appeal against such decision or

determination to the Board (of Review), stating the grounds of

such appeal. The Commissioner did not, before the execution of

the conveyance, communicate the determination (to accept Lot X

of the Preliminary Plan as the extent of land as is reasonably

appurtenant to the house No. 5/1) to the petitioner or any of the

co-owners to the land depriving them the opportunity to appeal

to the Board of Review against that determination. This is a

serious procedural flaw, which alone is sufficient to allow the

application of the petitioner. Vide Leelawathie v. Commissioner

of National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR 175, Muttiah v. Commissioner

of National Housing [1995] 2 Sri LR 74.

For the aforesaid reasons, I allow the application of the

petitioner and grant reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (a) and

(c) of the prayer to the petition. Accordingly, I quash by

certiorari the determination of the Commissioner of National

9

Housing to adopt the Plan marked P9 to decide singularly the

extent of land reasonably appurtenant to house No. 5/1, and

compel the Commissioner by mandamus to cancel the

conveyance P12 which was executed based on the said

determination.

There is a misconception that in judicial review, this Court

cannot give directions to the authorities what to do and how to

do. In Wickremasighe v. Chandrananda de Silva, Secretary

Ministry of Defence [2001] 2 Sri LR 333 at 353 Gunawardena J.

held:

That justice is blind does not mean judges should not be

clear sighted. Besides, as stated above as well under the

judicial review procedure the court exercises a supervisory

jurisdiction. A court exercising such supervisory powers can

inspect and even direct. Under the judicial review

procedure, far from being confined to the matters averred in

the petition, the court is less inhibited and is free to adopt a

more interventionist attitude-not with a view to withholding

or denying relief but with a view to grant it when justice of

the case demands that such a course of action be adopted.

I direct the Commissioner of National Housing to hold a proper

inquiry with the participation of the alleged co-owners of the

land (i.e. the parties to the partition action) including the

petitioner and make a fresh determination in terms of section

16(1) of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law.

Application is allowed with costs.
