Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari the decisions marked P3(a), P4(a), P5, P6, P7(a),

P8(a), P9, P10, P10(b) and P10(d) of the Acquiring Officer

(Divisional Secretary-Maharagama) made after an inquiry under

section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act whereby it was decided not

to pay compensation to the petitioners for certain portions of the

land acquired, on the basis that those portions of land had

previously been acquired.

Learned State Counsel appearing for the Acquiring Officer has

no idea when the alleged previous acquisition has taken place,

but submits that it can even be before the Land Acquisition Act

became law and probably in 1920s. I doubt about the said

assertion, as the Tenement List marked X1, under Remarks,

refers to Taken over under section 38(A) of the Land Acquisition

Act. That does not refer to the present acquisition, but the

previous one.

Be that as it may, no Gazette has been produced by the State to

prove such Vesting Order, but has inter alia produced the

Tenement List marked X1, which is based on the Preliminary

Plan Register maintained at the Surveyor Generals Office

marked X2, together with an affidavit of the Surveyor General.

If the land has already been acquired, there is no reason to

acquire it again.

In any event, the documents relied on by the State including the

ones referred to above, at best, prove acquisition, but not

payment of compensation for the acquired portions of land.

3

Acquisition and payment of compensation are not the same but

two different things. For instance, by Gazette marked 1R1,

portions of land have been acquired, but claim inquiry for the

purpose of payment of compensation has been held several

years after the said acquisition.

The petitioners do not dispute the decision for acquisition. They

only dispute the decision not to pay compensation for the

acquired portions. They have no idea about previous

acquisition. That has, if at all, happened several generations

ago.

I quash the decisions of the Acquiring Officer not to pay

compensation to the petitioners on the basis that those portions

had previously been acquired by the State. Let the Acquiring

Officer decide the amount of compensation to be paid after a

fresh inquiry.

Application allowed. No costs.
