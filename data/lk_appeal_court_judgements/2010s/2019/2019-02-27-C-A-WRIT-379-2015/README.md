Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Rasika Dissanayake for the Petitioner.

Suranga Wimalasena, S.S.C., for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 25.02.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking a mandate in

the nature of writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st

respondent (Director General of Pensions) marked P10, and a

mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus directing the 1st

respondent to grant reliefs to the petitioner as a beneficiary of

the widowers and orphans pension scheme.

By P10 the 1st respondent refused the application of the

petitioner to consider him as a beneficiary of the pension

scheme on the basis that his deceased wife has, as seen from

R1, expressly informed her unwillingness to join the pension

scheme.

The petitioner has filed this application based on Public

Administration Circulars No. 13/2001 and 13/2001(III) marked

P3 and P3(a), and the Government Gazette No. 1844/71 dated

10.01.2014 marked P4.

It is undisputed that P3, P3(a) and P4 are based on section 3(6)

of the Widowers and Orphans Pension Act, No. 24 of 1983, as

amended by Widowers and Orphans Pension (Amendment) Act,

No. 2 of 2001.

3

Section 3(6) of the Act reads as follows:

3(6)(a) An officer holding office on the appointed date may,

before such date as may be appointed, for the purposes of

this subsection, by the Minister, from time to time, by Notice

published in the Gazette, elect to be a contributor to the

Pension Scheme.

Where any such officer has died prior to the coming into

force of this subsection or dies before the date appointed for

the purposes of this subsection without making an election

as aforesaid, she shall, if she leaves a husband or child or

a husband and child or a husband and children, be

deemed to have elected to be a contributor to the Pension

Scheme;

(b) any person who elects to become a contributor under

this subsection or in the case of a person who is deemed to

have elected to become a contributor to the Pension Scheme

under this subsection, the person administering the estate

of such deceased person, shall pay to the Pension Scheme

in such instalments as may be determined by the Minister

by notice published in the Gazette, all arrears of

contributions for the period commencing from the appointed

date until the date of election, retirement or death, as the

case may be, with compound interest thereon at the rate of

four per centum per annum;

(c) Where a contributor or the person administering the

estate of a deceased contributor is unable to pay the

arrears of contribution, such arrears shall be recovered from

the pension payable to the Widower or Orphans of such

4

contributor, in such instalments as may be determined by

the Director.

P3, P3(a) Circulars, and P4 Gazette Notification are sequel to the

said Amendment.

P3 Circular by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration as relevant to this application reads as follows:

2001 2 -

1. 1983 231 1985 291 . 2. 2002.02.22 . 3. 01 1983.08.01 2002.02.22 . 4. 1. 1 . . . . . 1983-08-01 (4%) 180 / . 1983-08-01 1 11 111 .

11. . 1983-08-01 180 . 1 11 . .

111. , . 86 , , ... 16 , 55 .

By P3(a) Circular the date to express preference for joining the

pension scheme was extended until 31.12.2005.

By P4 Gazette, the Minister made the following determinations.

1. Of the female officers who had received appointments

prior to 01.08.1983 who are in service on that date, and

if they should decide to express preference for joining

this pension scheme before a certain date, that date

should be taken as 31.12.2014.

2. If the female officer had already retired, arrears of

membership fees and interest should be paid all at once,

and that it should comply with pension circular 3/2008.

3. It is ordered that if the female officer is deceased, the

relevant membership fee and interest should be

deducted all at once from the award, and if the female

officer is still in service, the total membership fee and the

interest should be deducted all at once before she

retires. Furthermore it is ordered that this directive is

limited only to those who have Sri Lankan citizenship.

The second part of section 3(6)(a) is the relevant part for the

purpose of this application. Let me reproduce it again for

convenience:

6

Where any such officer has died prior to the coming into

force of this subsection or dies before the date appointed for

the purposes of this subsection without making an election

as aforesaid, she shall, if she leaves a husband or child or

a husband and child or a husband and children, be

deemed to have elected to be a contributor to the Pension

Scheme;

Accordingly, two conditions shall be satisfied for this section to

be applicable.

(a) The officer shall die prior to the coming into force of this

subsection or before the date appointed for the purposes

of this subsection

(b) The officer shall die without making an election to join

the pension scheme

I will first consider the (b) above. It is common ground that the

deceased wife of the petitioner never became a contributor to the

pension scheme. Not only that, she, while in service, in

response to the Public Administration Circular No. 231 dated

28.11.1983, by R1 dated 29.01.1984, expressed her

unwillingness to join the pension scheme.

231 1983-11-28 ..

I cannot accept the argument of the learned counsel for the

petitioner that it shall not be considered as expressing

7

unwillingness, but taken to mean that she maintained a neutral

position. There was no choice as such in R1. In R1, there were

only two choices: consent to join the pension scheme is given or

not given. She has deleted not given. If she wanted to

maintain a neutral position, as the learned counsel for the

plaintiff suggests, she could have remained silent without

submitting R1. There could not have been any compulsion to fill

that Form and hand it over to the Head of the Department. If

she remained silent as such, for the purposes of section 3(6)(a)

referred to above, she could have been treated as an officer who

died without making an election. Therefore, in my view, the

petitioner does not satisfy (b) above.

On the other hand, even if it is considered for the sake of

argument that she died without making an election, for the

petitioner to become a beneficiary, she should have, according to

(a) above, died before 31.12.2005. Let me elaborate it further.

It is common ground that:

1) The Amendment Act, No. 2 of 2001, came into force on

21.03.2001

2) The date appointed by the Minister for the purposes of

the said section was 31.12.2005

3) The wife of the petitioner died on 02.05.2013

Hence the petitioner fails in (b) above as well.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
