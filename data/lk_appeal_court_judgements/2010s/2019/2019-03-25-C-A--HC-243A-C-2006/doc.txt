ACHALA "WENGAPPULI J.

The three Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the" 1st to

3rd Appellants") were indicted by the Han. Attorney General for

committing murder of one Hettiarachchige Sarath Sisira Kumara on or about

10.08.2000 and, in the course of the same transaction committing robbery

of a three-wheeler bearing number 203 - 2324 valued at Rs. 120,000.00.

After trial all three Appellants were convicted on both these counts by the

High Court of Gampaha and they were accordingly sentenced to death, in

2

....

addition to an imposition of a fifteen-year sentence, on account of the

offence of robbery.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions and sentences, the

Appellants have invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to

set them aside on several grounds of appeal.

Learned Counsel for the 1st Appellant, relied on the following

grounds of appeal;

a. there was no evidence before the trial Court to convict the 1st

Appellant eith~r to the charge of murder or to robbery,

b. the trial Court has erroneously imputed criminal liability on him

under Section 32 of the Penal Code,

c. the prosecution has failed to establish the production chain.

In support of the 2nd Appellant's appeal, learned President's Counsel

relied on the following grounds of appeal;

a. the conviction of the Appellants is bad since the trial Court had

amended the indictment during the course of its judgment and

thereby denying them of a fair trial,

b. the conviction of the Appellants is bad since the trial Court found

them guilty solely on the prosecution evidence without

considering contents in their statements from the dock,

c. the trial Court made an error when it failed to consider the

explanation by the 2nd Appellant regarding stains of blood found

on his shirt,

d. the trial Court erred in considering evidence when it misled

itself in relation to the evidence of discovery of a knife, by

3

attributing it to the 2nd Appellant, when in fact it was discovered

upon the information provided by the 3rd Appellant,

e. the trial Court has failed to consider whether there was common

murderous intention among all three Appellants in convicting

them for murder upon imputing criminal liability under Section

32 of the Penal Code.

The 3rd Appellant, whilst associating himself with the grounds of

appeal raised by the other Appellants, opted to raise an additional ground

for himself on the basis that the trial Court has failed to consider the

medical evidence that it was improbable to cause the injuries as seen on

the body of the deceased by a knife with a bent blade which the

prosecution claimed to have been recovered upon information provided

by him.

It must be noted at the outset that the prosecution presented a case

essentially based on items of circumstantial evidence against the three

Appellants. In view of the several grounds of appeal raised by the three

Appellants, which are primarily based on the imposition of criminal

liability under Section 32 of the Penal Code in respect of the two counts

contained in the indictment, it is prudent to consider them in the light of

the evidence presented by the prosecution before the trial Court.

Therefore, a precis of the evidence for the prosecution as well as for the

Appellants, is useful at this stage of the judgment.

The deceased was a resident of Ihala Karagahamuna of Kadawatha who

could repair and drive three wheelers. He did not have a licence

apparently being an underage person to apply for one. However, he used

4

..... -

to run hires of the three wheeler bearing number 203 - 2324 from a three

wheel park along Kadawatha Ganemulla main road, with the consent of its

owner Sirisena upon rental of Rs. 210.00 a day.

Witnesses Sumith and Janaka, who were related to the deceased, have

stated that the deceased had left their horne on 09.08.2000 at about 7.30

p.m. with the said three wheeler. On the following morning they received

information from Kadawatha Police that the deceased was killed and his

vehicle was robbed. They had gone to the place where the dead body was

found.

.. The same night, Richard Gunaratne, a Kepakaru of the Kirindiwela

Meddegama Rajamaha Viharaya was preparing tea in the temple kitchen at

about 1.00 a.m., when he heard a dog barking which alerted him to some

activity in the vicinity. He then heard the sound of someone trying to start

up the engine of a three wheeler. There is a public road running along the

rear boundary of the temple and as the witness heard this sound, he

flashed his torch in that direction. Then a three wheeler had driven away.

With day break, he was told that there is a dead body, and found the body

of the deceased with bleeding injuries lying by the side of the road, in the

direction he heard the noise of the three wheeler the previous night. He

then alerted the Police. During cross examination, the witness said that he

did not hear anyone shouting that night.

PS 21895 Jayatilaka was manning a check point at Warakapola

Junction with three others and at 5.25 a.m. on 10.08.2000, stopped the three

wheeler bearing number 203-2324. It carne along Kandy road from the

direction of Colombo. The 1st Appellant was its driver and the other two

5

Appellants were his passengers. They were questioned by the witness and

their conflicting claims arose suspicion in the mind of the witness who

then conducted a search on the three Appellants.

The 1st Appellant had a toy pistol with him and the officer noted

human blood stains on his shirt, which were still wet. He had some cash

and few other documents with him including his driving licence. Upon a

search carried out on the 2nd Appellant, the officer recovered a knife and

noted its blade had human blood stains . His shirt also had similar stains.

The denim trouser worn by the 3rd Appellant also had large "blood" stains

on both of its legs.

Upon searching the three wheeler, the witness noted a large patch of

blood on its rear deck. He took charge of its revenue licence and certificate

of insurance along with several other items including a kitul club and two

note books.

The three Appellants were thereafter taken to Warakapola Police

Station and the officer has produced them to the station along with the

production items recovered from them after making relevant entries in the

Productions Register.

IP Wijeratne was the Officer-in-Charge of Kirindiwela Police during

this time and on 10.08.2000 at 6.20 a.m. received a telephone call informing

him of a discovery of a unidentified dead body near Kirindiwela Meddegama

Rajamaha Viharaya. He proceeded to the place where the body of the

deceased was found. It was a lonely place along a roadway, which was

surrounded by shrub jungle and thick grass. There were two stab injuries

on the chest area of the body with bloodstains. The deceased had a tattoo

6

which reads as "Janaka" and wore a red T shirt and a grey denim trouser.

He noted a piece of coir rope with stains like blood near the body.

The Avasaya of the resident monks of the temple was located about

75 meters from the place where the dead body was found 'and he has

recorded a statement from Gunaratne, the Kepakaru of the temple.

At about 10.15 a.m., whilst conducting investigations at the scene he

received information from Warakapola Police that the three wheeler 203 -

2324 that had been robbed from his area was taken into custody along with

three suspects at a check point. He assigned SI Vander Gert to take charge

of the vehicle and suspects from Warakapola Police and had taken steps to

record statements from the owner of the three wheeler, and the persons

who identified the dead body.

51 Vander Gert, took charge of the three Appellants, the vehicle and a

multitude of other items of productions, which had already been entered

in the Productions Register of Warakapola Police, under PR. Nos. 87 to 91

on 10.08.2000 in the afternoon from PC Piyasena who was the reservist at

that time. He then produced the Appellants and the items of productions

to Kirindiwela Police under PR Nos. 191 to 195 in the same evening to

reservist PS 346 Yasanayaka.

IP Wijeratne then recorded the statement of 3rd Appellant at

Kirindiwela Police Station and upon the information provided by him

recovered a knife with a bent blade from a place located about 36 feet

away from the place where the body was found. The officer has recovered

the deceased's wallet from the gutter of the roof of an eatery in Warakapola

town on 11.08.2000 at about 3.45 p.m. also upon information provided by

7

the 3rd Appellant This wallet contained several documents including the

deceased's identity card, which established the identity of its ownership ..

Having made initial investigations, facts were reported to the

Magistrate's Court. IP Wijeratne then moved Court to < direct the

Government Analyst to conduct scientific investigations on the items of

productions and report back. PS 5690 Wijebandra of Kirindiwela Police took

these items of production to Government Analyst Department and handed

them over on 31.08.2000.

Dr. Hewapatirana, who performed the post mortem examination on

the body of the deceased observed only two stab injuries on the front of

the chest. The 2 inch wide 1st stab injury was located 2 1/2 inches below the

collar bone and about 1 inch from the mid line towards the right. It had

penetrated into the chest cavity through the 3rd and 4th intercostal space,

piercing the right lung. The 2nd stab injury was also measured 2 inches

wide and was located 3 inches below the collar bone and 1 inch from the

mid line towards the left. It also penetrated into the chest cavity through

the 4th and 5th inter costal space and pierced the left ventricle of the heart,

thereby causing a necessarily fatal injury. Both these stab injuries have

penetrated 4 inches deep into the chest cavity and there were 2 litres of

blood collected in it. Death of the deceased was the result of II shock due to

bleeding following stab injuries to the chest."

There were no other injuries observed by the Medical Officer on the

body of the deceased and it is clear that there were no signs of any

resistance offered by the deceased at the time of infliction of the two stab

injuries nor to suspect that he struggled at the time of its infliction. He was

8

of the opinion that the two stabs could have been caused when the

deceased was held in the same position and his death could well have

occurred within I to 3 hours since his last meal.

He also expressed his opinion that the two knives recovered from

the Appellants could have been used to inflict the said stab injuries and the

acts of stabbing were possible within the confined space available in a

three wheeler. He is of the opinion that these injuries could have been

caused very easily, if the deceased was being held by the others.

The Government Analyst Department received a properly sealed

parcel containing several items of productions in relation to the

investigations conducted by Kirindiwela Police on 28.08.2000 from the

Magistrate's Court of Pugoda, under case No. BR 276/2000 and delivered

to it by PS 5690 Wijebandara. The parcel contained items marked as PI to

PIO (as per the questionnaire) which consists of two shirts (PI and P2), two

trousers(P4 and P6), two knives (P3 and P8), one T shirt (P7), one cotton

swab (P5), one blood sample (P9) and a control sample (PIO).

Report of the Assistant Government Analyst, Ms. Bandaranayke

indicates that after her analysis of these items of productions, its results

revealed that the items marked as PI, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7 and P8 have tested

positive for having traces of "human blood". The trouser marked P4 was

tested positive only for traces of "blood". No blood was identified by the

Government Analyst on the knife marked as P3.

That was basically the evidence presented by the prosecution

against the three Appellants. When the trial Court ruled that they have a

9

case to answer at the close of the prosecution case, the three Appellants

made statements from the dock.

It is the position of the 1st Appellant that he had a funeral to attend

in the Warakapola area and having met the other two Appellants on the

evening of "08/08/2000" they consumed some toddy at a friend's house.

Then they came to Warakapola town and were waiting near the bus stand.

There was a barrier nearby. The officers who manned the barrier have

called them to the barrier several times but since they did not comply with

the direction, one of the officers found fault with them. That escalated into

an argument as they were intoxicated liquor. Then they were escorted to

the Police where they were questioned about a three wheeler. They have

complained to the Officer-in-Charge of the Station who arrived there in the

morning. He directed the officers to release the Appellants after recording

their statements. At that time Kirindiwela Police conveyed information of

the death of a person and they suspected the Appellant's involvement.

Thereafter they were handed over to Kirindiwela Police who kept them for

7 days in detention. They were tortured and heavily beaten up and as a

result he has lost a finger. They were finally produced before Court.

The 2 nd Appellant claimed that he arrived at "Warakapola Stand" and

had consumed some alcohol. He was then questioned by two Police

officers. He then stated that "they" argued back with the officers which

resulted in an assault. He was bleeding from his nose. The three of them

were arrested and locked up. He told his version to the OIC. Following

morning they were taken to Kirindiwela Police and beaten up while

questioning them about the three wheeler. He said "yes" to everything he

was asked.

10

In his short statement, the 3rd Appellant denied any knowledge of

the incident although he said "yes" to everything the Police asked. He was

arrested at Warakapola. He protests his innocence since he had no

involvement with the incident.

With this brief reference to the evidence that had been placed before

the trial Court, it is appropriate at this stage to consider the common

ground of appeal of the three Appellants that the trial Court erred in

relation to the imposition of criminal liability under Section 32 of the Penal

Code.

In relation to the matter before us, being a case based on items of

circumstantial evidence, the collective contention of the Appellants could

be crystallised into following two issues;

a. whether there was sufficient evidence before the trial Court to

convict each of the Appellants for the offence of Robbery under

Section 32 liability ?

b. whether there was sufficient evidence before the trial Court to

convict the Appellants for the offence of Murder under Section 32

liability ?

In addition, the learned President's Counsel for the 2nd Appellant

further contended that there was a serious flaw in the procedure adopted

by the trial Court in conducting the trial of the Appellant. The learned

President's Counsel invited our attention to the fact that the indictment

presented by the Hon. Attorney General, in its original form, had no

reference to Section 32 of the Penal Code and the learned High Court

Judge on his own motion has amended the indictment in the course of his

11

judgment to include Section 32 and having recorded their plea to the

amended indictment, he pronounced his conclusion by convicting all three

Appellants as charged.

It was submitted by the learned President's Counsel that this course

of action is in violation of the provisions contained in Section 167 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 since it clearly states" any

Court may alter any indictment or charge at any time before judgment is

pronounced ... ". Learned President's Counsel further contended that the

resultant position is the learned High Court Judge did not consider the

evidence of the prosecution in the light of the legal principle laid down in

Section 32 and therefore, the conviction based on the said legal principle

could not be valid.

Learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the

Respondent sought to counter the contention of the 2nd Appellant by

making reference to the journal entry dated 30.11.2006 and the contents of

the judgment. The journal entry of 30.11.2006 indicated that the trial Court

has caused to amend the indictment to include a reference to Section 32,

prior to the conviction of the Appellants. The reference in the judgment (at

p. 454 of the appeal brief) to the amendment could be found in its

penultimate paragraph, where the learned High Court Judge found the

Appellants guilty to the two counts contained in the indictment which has

just been amended.

Learned Additional Solicitor General also referred to the fact that,

just after the indictment was amended by the learned High Court Judge,

having recorded the Appellants' plea, provided an opportunity for them to

12

reconsider their respective positions in VIew of the said amendment.

Only upon their reply in the negative that the trial Court has pronounced

its judgment convicting them on the two counts.

The procedure adopted by the learned High Court Judge is not the

most desirable course of action in such circumstances. It is unfortunate

that the trial Court was not assisted by the prosecutor in inviting its

attention to the judgment of The Attorney General v Munasinghe and three

Others 69 N.L.R. 241 where five Justices of the then Supreme Court have

considered this question and decided to answer it in the following form;

"Must there be a reference to section 32 in the charge?

Indeed the question referred to this court is in this very form.

Formulated thus the question must, I think, be answered in

the negative. Section 32 does not create an offence; it is only

a section laying down a principle of liability. 1/

Thus it is clear that the mere absence of any reference to Section 32

of the Penal Code does not prevent a trial Court in imposing criminal

liability upon the several accused who are named in the indictment of

committing the offence of murder. However, the important question arises

in view of the rather late attempt of imposition of criminal liability under

Section 32, whether the said amendment has resulted in the failure of the

trial Court to consider the evidence in the light of the said principle of law.

13

In the judgment of Wijithasiri and Another v Republic of Sri Lanka

(1990) 1 Sri L.R. 56, this Court reiterated the principles that had been

clearly enunciated in the judgment of King v. Assappu and Others 50 NLR

324 in relation to the underlying principles that had to be applied by a trial

Court where criminal liability under Section 32 of the Penal Code is to be

imposed. In King v. Assappu and Others (ibid) it was held that;

" ... where the question of common intention arises the jury

must be directed that

(1) the case of each accused must be considered

separately.

(2) that the accused must have been actuated by a

common intention with the doer of the act at

the time the offence was committed.

(3) common intention must not be confused with

similar intention entertained independently of

each other

(4) there must be evidence of either or

circumstantial evidence of a pre-arranged plan

or some other evidence of common intention.

(5) the mere fact of the presence of the co-accused

at the time of the offence is not necessarily

evidence of common intention unless there is

other evidence which justifies them in so

holding./I

14

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court reveals that it had not

specifically referred to any of the above principles in its text. However,

quite unmistakably it could be observed from the text and the presentation

of the judgment, that the trial Court, in its consideration of the several

items of circumstantial evidence, has applied those principles to arrive at

the conclusion it eventually did. The trial Court has considered the items

of circumstantial evidence that are common to all three Appellants as well

as the one which are specific to each Appellant.

The contention of the Appellants is based on the repetitive usage of

the word " Cj05t5)!:J)6l0~ " in the body of the judgment, as a factor indicative

that the Court did not consider evidence against each of the Appellants

separately. The mere fact of making reference to the Appellants in plural,

that factor alone could not be construed to hold that the trial Court has not

considered the evidence against each of the Appellants separately. It is

clear from the presentation and analysis of evidence undertaken by the

trial Court, it has come to the conclusion that all three Appellants were

present throughout the entire transaction, from the point of the robbery of

the three-wheeler to the point of murder of the deceased. Hence, the

reference to the Appellants in plural should be understood in that context.

In Rajadheera and Others v Attorney General (2008) 2 Sri L.R. 321, it was

held that;

"Although it is not strictly necessary for the learned trial

Judge who has a trained legal mind to state all the principles

of law relating to common intention, it must be apparent

15

from the judgment that he had directed his mind to the

relevant principles of law because especially in a case of

murder he should be mindful that he was dealing with

liberty of a person. When accused persons are charged on

the basis of common intention trial judge or the jury as the

case may be must be mindful of the principles laid down

in King v Assappu"

Considering the impugned judgment of the trial Court we are

satisfied that the learned High Court Judge was mindful of the principles

of law involved with common intention as laid down in King v Assappu

and have applied them in determining the guilt or innocence of the

Appellants.

Another contention advanced by the Learned President's Counsel

for the 2nd Appellant is that there were only two stab injuries on the body

of the deceased and from the medical evidence it is clear that such an

injury could not have been inflicted using a knife with a bent blade.

Therefore, the prosecution is not in a position to prove that the three

Appellants have acted with common murderous intention, because, in

order to find them guilty of murder, the available evidence, being

circumstantial in nature, is not conclusive. He further submitted "if at all

they are only guilty to the charge of robbery."

It seems this particular submission of the learned President's

Counsel has an underlying notion that it is not possible to convict multiple

accused for murder if the evidence against them are of circumstantial in

16

..

nature. However, in fairness to the learned Counsel, it must be stated that

he did refer to insufficiency of evidence. Learned President's Counsel's

contention is based on the apparent unequal participation by the

Appellants in the infliction of stab injuries. It was submitted th?t in view of

the fact that the deceased had only two stab injuries, it is virtually an

impossibility that three persons were involved in inflicting them using

only one knife.

There is no rule that where several accused are charged with

committing murder, it is not possible to find them guilty if there were only

items of circumstantial evidence against them. As per King v. Assappu and

Others (supra) it has been stressed that there must be evidence to the effect

that" the accused must have been actuated by a common intention with the doer of

the act at the time the offence was committed." This pronouncement envisages

a situation where there are different degrees of participation with the

commission of the offence of murder by the accused. In our opinion,

therefore it is rather a question of sufficiency of evidence, irrespective of its

nature, whether they are direct or circumstantial.

What is expected of a prosecution in imposing criminal liability

under Section 32 has been considered in greater detail in the judgment of

The Attorney General v Munasinghe and three Others (supra) in the

following manner;

"Where more persons than one are involved in the

commission of one offence there are some cases in which

there is what appears to be equal participation : for example

X and Y may join in bludgeoning A to death each attacking

17

with a club; in this type of case it is more often than not

impossible to prove which of the participants inflicted the

fatal injury; details of the participation may be obscure and

beyond the reach of any investigator; but before a case of

joint commission of the offence is established it would be

necessary for the prosecutor to prove that both X and Y

attacked, that one or more of the blows (irrespective of who

struck) resulted in the death of A and that each X and Y

were acting in furtherance of the common intention of both

to cause the death of A. There can also be, seemingly

unequal participation: X and Y may join in order to achieve

their common intention of causing the death of A, X doing

the bludgeoning while Y keeps a lookout to prevent their

being surprised by an intruder. This is the type of case in

which it has been said of persons who playa role similar to

yl s, that II he also serves who only stands and wai ts II. Y

has not done anything which, in the physiological sense, can

be said to have caused the death of A. No medical witness

will test{fy that yl s act of keeping watch caused, or was one

of the (actors contributing to, the death of A. But it is

unnecessary to understand the expression II cause death II

in section 293 of the Penal Code in this somewhat limited

medico-legal sense. The result achieved by X and Y is the

death ofA. The acts by which that result was intended to be

achieved are the totality of the acts of both persons. Some of

the acts would never by themselves achieve the ultimate

18

result intended; they would only be furthering the

attainment of that result. " (emphasis added)

" In view of this clear pronouncement by a divisional bench of the

then Supreme Court, when the three Appellants were charged for murder

of the deceased, the fact that there were only two stab injuries which could

have been inflicted with one knife alone, is not a shield preventing them to

be found guilty due to their "unequal participation" with the commission of

the offence of murder.

In this situation, the resultant position is that it was incumbent upon

the trial Court to satisfy itself whether the prosecution has proved that

each of the other accused were actuated by a common murderous

intention with the doer of the act at the time the offence of murder was

committed.

The trial Court has considered the evidence that the shirts worn by

the 1st and 2ndAppellants had wet patches of human blood while the

trouser worn by the 3rd Appellant had large patches of "blood" when they

were arrested at the check point in' the early morning with the three-

wheeler, which was in the possession of the deceased in the previous

night. It considered the noise heard by the kepakaru of the temple which

seem to suggest that it was at that time the body of the deceased was

dumped at the place where it was later found. It was on the same morning

the Appellants were arrested.

When the evidence presented by the prosecution is considered, it is

reasonable to infer that the deceased was already dead when the Kepakaru

19

heard some activity at 1.00 a.m. near the rear boundary of the temple.

Whoever, who carne in that three-wheeler, has fled from the scene when

the witness flashed his torch in that direction. The body of the deceased

would have been already dumped there before the three ~heeler was

driven away.

The medical evidence is clear that the deceased had his last meal 1 to

3 hours prior to his death due to stabbing. His relations confirmed that he

left their horne at about 7.30 p.m. in the previous evening. Therefore the

death of the deceased would most probably have occurred around 12.00

midnight. His body was transported to the place where it was eventually

dumped using his own three-wheeler to transport it as indicative from the

large human blood patch on its rear deck. Within 5 hours of the dumping

of the dead body, the said three-wheeler was found in the possession of

the three Appellants. Only the 1st Appellant was in possession of a driver's

license and therefore it can safely be assumed that he drove the vehicle

after it was robbed from the deceased that same evening until taken charge

by the officers who manned the check point at Warakapola.

There is no doubt that the body that was recovered near the temple

was that of the deceased named in the indictment and the three-wheeler

that was in the possession of the three Appellants was the one that had

been forcibly taken from the possession of the deceased that late evening.

There was evidence that the three Appellants were from three

different areas of the country and were arrested together few hours after

the death of the deceased possessing his three-wheeler. The 1st and 3rd

20

Appellants had other items belonging to the deceased with them or had

knowledge where some of them were.

The 3rd Appellant had knowledge where a knife was located near

the place where the dead body was. He also had knowledge of the place

where the wallet belonging to the deceased was found. In view of these

factors, it could safely be inferred that he had knowledge of these two

places because it was he who put them there, in the absence of an

explanation offered by him in view of the pronouncement of the apex

Court in its judgments of Ariyasinghe and -Others v Attorney General

(2004) 2 Sri L.R. 357 at p.386 and Wimalaratne & Others v Attorney

General (1997 1 SLR 309. He also failed to deny the specific item of

evidence led by the prosecution in his dock statement

A divisional bench of the then Supreme Court, in its judgment of Don

Somapala v Republic of Sri Lanka 78 N.L.R. 183 held that;

"The Court may presume that a man who is in possession of

stolen goods, soon after the theft, is either a thief or has

received goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can

account for its possession. This is a presumption which a

Court mayor may not draw depending on the

circumstances of the case. There is no II similar II

presumption that a murder committed In the same

transaction was committed by the person who had such

posseSSIOn. There is no presumptive proof of this. The

burden still remains to prove beyond reasonable doubt that

21

the person who committed the robbery did also commit the

murder."

The evidence presented before the trial Court and the reasonable

inferences that could be drawn from those items of evidence are sufficient

to arrive at the conclusion that the Appellants were in possession of the

three-wheeler of the deceased. They were in possession of the three-

wheeler because they robbed it from the possession of the deceased just

few hours before. They transported his body to the place near the temple.

That factor justified the finding of guilt of the Appellants to the count of

robbery by the trial Court. However, as their Lordships have held in Don

Somapala v Republic of Sri Lanka (ibid) there is no similar presumption

that could be drawn in respect of the charge of murder that it was

committed by the three Appellants.

In order to justify their conviction for murder there should be

sufficient evidence that each of the other two Appellants were actuated by

common murderous intention which they shared with the Appellant who

stabbed the deceased twice on his chest with a knife.

This Court has already indicated its mind that the body of the

deceased was dumped near the temple by the three Appellants as

indicative by the evidence to the effect that the 1st Appellant being the only

person who had a licence to drive, and the 3rd Appellant's knowledge of

the place where a knife with a bended blade was recovered. The 2nd

Appellant had a similar knife in his possession at the time of his arrest and

its blade had traces of "human blood". This evidence supports a strong

22

inference that all the Appellants were present when one of them

stabbed the deceased twice.

The shirts worn by the 1st and 2nd Appellants also had "human

blood" patches on its front side and they were still wet at the time of

arrest. So they were in close proximity to the Appellant who stabbed the

deceased.

It is the opinion of the medical expert that if the deceased was held

by the others that would have facilitated the person who inflicted the two

stabs, one of which is necessarily a fatal injury. His opinion is based on the

fact that there were no tell-tale signs that the deceased ever struggled or

attempted to protect himself from the act of stabbing. The injury pattern is

clearly consistent with repeated stabs by one person and they penetrated 4

inches deep. It must be noted that none of the rib bones were cut or

damaged. The penetrating stabbing had taken place accurately finding the

gap of soft tissue within two ribs, through which the knife blade could

easily penetrate. When considered in the light of these, it is reasonable to

infer that the person who stabbed the deceased had carefully chosen the

most vulnerable area of the chest and made sure the stabs penetrated well

into the chest cavity sufficient enough to damage the internal organs.

This is not possible with a moving target. The stab site had to be

relatively stable for the person who stabbed to inflict such clean wounds

with no drag of the blade. This leads to the inference that therefore he was

assisted by some other person or persons.

As already noted wet human blood patches found in the front part

of the shirts worn by the 1st and the 2nd Appellants and the trouser worn

23

by the 3rd Appellant brings them to close proximity to the act of stabbing.

It is unfortunate the prosecution deprived the trial Court of the expert

opinion of the pattern of the blood patches on the clothing worn by the

Appellants by failing to elicit that evidence from the expert who gave

evidence before the trial Court. However, the evidence of the presence of

multiple blood patches observed on the front part of the two shirts

provides for this deficiency and are indicative of splashing of blood when

the deceased was stabbed. In addition, the 2nd Appellant was in possession

of a knife with human blood stains few hours after the death of the

deceased.

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the 2nd Appellant

provided an explanation for the blood in his shirt, which fact the trial

Court failed to consider. This aspect will be dealt in the latter part of this

judgment.

In our view this satisfies the situation discussed in the judgment of

The Attorney General v Munasinghe and three Others (supra) which has

been emphasised by us.

Therefore, we are of the firm opinion that there was sufficient,

truthful and reliable circumstantial evidence to satisfy the trial Court

beyond reasonable doubt that the two remaining Appellants were actuated

by a common murderous intention, which they shared with the other

Appellant, when he inflicted the necessarily fatal injury on the deceased.

We are satisfied that the available evidence thus far referred to

In this judgment are totally inconsistent with the innocence of the

Appellants and only consistent with their guilt.

24

..,

It is time to consider the remammg grounds of appeal of the

Appellants.

The remaining three grounds of appeal that had been raised on

behalf of the 2nd Appellant, namely that the trial Court has failed to

consider the evidence presented on behalf of the Appellants, failure to

consider the explanation offered by him for the blood stains on his shirt

and the factual error of attributing the discovery of a knife under Section

27 of the Evidence Ordinance to the 2nd Appellant, when in fact it has been

.. recovered upon it being pointed out by the 3rd Appellant, could be

considered together since they relates to the general complaint that the

trial Court has failed to properly consider their case.

As noted earlier all three Appellants have made statements from the

dock. The trial Court, in its impugned judgment made reference to the fact

that the three Appellants have made statements from the dock and

referred to its contents in the Court's consideration of the evidence as a

whole. The trial Court, having considered the contents of statements of the

Appellants from the dock, observed, that there was no denial of the fact

that the blood-stained clothing were recovered from them and noted that

they failed to offer any explanation as to the presence of blood stains on

them.

In fact the 2nd Appellant, in his dock statement claimed that he was

assaulted by two policemen and he was bleeding from his nose.

Learned President's Counsel contended that therefore the 2 nd

Appellant provided an explanation for the presence of blood stains in his 25

clothing and the trial Court has totally overlooked this vital piece of

evidence from its consideration and thereby seriously prejudiced his right

to a fair trial by convicting him without considering his explanation.

It is correct that the trial Court has totally failed to consider the claim

of the 2nd Appellant that he was bleeding from his nose after the Police

assault at the time of his arrest. This is a serious lapse by the trial Court

since it concluded that there was no explanation offered as to the presence

of the blood stains on his shirt.

In Udagama v Attorney General (2000) 2 Sri L.R. 103, this Court,

after considering the material before it, held that a failure to consider the

dock statement by the trial Court caused serious prejudice to the accused.

This Court must then examine whether such failure by the trial

Court has prejudiced the 2nd Appellant. It is noted by this Court, during

his rather lengthy cross examination of the police officer who arrested him

at the check point, did suggest to the witness that he was assaulted. The

officer of course denied such assault while adding that the Appellants

acted obediently to their directions during the search and arrest. There was

not even a hint of a suggestion to th~ witness that due to the said assault

on the 2nd Appellant, he bled from the nose. Contrary to his statement from

the dock, the 2nd Appellant suggested to the officer that those stains were

in fact not blood stains but mere stains (Ol@@@) on the fabric.

In applying the test of consistency on the evidence of the 2nd

Appellant, it is clear that the claim of nose bleeding was thought of only at

the late stage of making a statement from the dock and therefore it was

cleverly introduced as an item of evidence upon an afterthought,

26

particularly in view of the incriminating evidence presented by the

prosecution. Owing to this factor his evidence should have been totally

rejected by the trial Court as it dearly did not result in creating reasonable

doubt of the prosecution case.

As to the complaint of factual mix up of the 2nd Appellant, instead of

the 3rd Appellant, in relation to the recovery of the knife from the place

where the body was found, it is our considered view that it had not caused

any prejudice to the 2nd Appellant in view of the fact that he was also in

possession of a similar knife, but with a blood-stained blade at the time of

his arrest. The trial Court did not utilise this factual mistake to determine

that the 2nd Appellant was the person who knew where it was recorded. It

only utilised this evidence to form an opinion as to the visual similarity of

the two knives.

Lastly the complaint by the 1st Appellant that the prosecution has

failed to establish the production chain should be considered. However,

the Appellant did not elaborate on the factual basis of his complaint.

The prosecution has led evidence from the relevant prosecution

witnesses to establish the fact that. from the moment these items of

productions were recovered from the three Appellants in the morning of

10.08.2000, they were properly entered in the relevant registers after

sealing them in to separate parcels under PR 87 to 91 and handed over

officially to the reservist (PS 17171 Piyasena) at the Warakapola Police

Station. These parcels were then received by SI Vander Gert of the

Kirindiwela Police on the same evening who in turn produced them under

different PR numbers on the same day. PS 23594 Yasanayake received them

27

.,.

from SI Vander Gert, as the reservist of his station, under PR 190 - 195 on

the same day. PS 5690 Wijebandra thereafter handed these production

items to the Government Analyst Department on 31.08.2000. Thus, the

prosecution has presented evidence of proper custody of the productions

in relation to the inward journey until its analysis by Ms. Bandaranyaka by

calling the relevant witnesses.

Although there was cross examination by all three Appellants of

these witnesses there was no evidence even to suggest that there was an

opportunity for these items of production to be tampered with or

contaminated. What is ~ expected of the prosecution in this regard was

considered in Perera v Attorney General (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 378, in the

following terms;

iJIt is a recognised principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove the productions had been forwarded

to the Analyst from proper custody, without allowing any

room for any suspicion that there had been no opportunity

for tampering or interfering with the productions till they

reach the Analyst. II

We are satisfied that the evidence that had been placed before the

trial Court are sufficient to prove this requirement that the production

items were not tampered or interfered with until its analysis at the

Government Analyst Department. In any event, if we were to ask the

question from ourselves II whether on the evidence, a reasonable jury, properly

28

directed on the burden of proof would without doubt have convicted the

appellant?" as their Lordships did in Mannar Mannan v Republic of Sri

Lanka (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 280, following Stirland v. D.P.P. 30 Cr. App. Rep.

40, we would also answer it in the affirmative.

In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs of

this judgment, we are of the view that there is no reason to interfere with

the conviction of the Appellants and the sentences imposed on them.

Therefore we affirm the conviction and sentences imposed on the three

Appellants. Accordingly the appeals of the Appellants stand dismissed.
