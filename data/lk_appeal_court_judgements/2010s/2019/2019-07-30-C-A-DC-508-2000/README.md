Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs have filed this action in the District Court of Kalutara

to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint among

the plaintiffs and the 1st-4th defendants. The 6th-11th defendants

have later intervened. The 7th-11th defendants have filed a joint

statement of claim and sought different reliefs. At the trial, on

behalf of the plaintiffs, 1st-6th issues have been raised, and on

behalf of the 7th-11th defendants, 7th-17th issues have been raised,

and several parties have given evidence, and a large number of old

deeds and plans have been produced. Ultimately, the District

Judge by 3 page Judgment has dismissed the action, as I

understand, on the basis that he cannot come to a conclusion on

(a) the land to be partitioned and (b) the rights of the parties,

because the case is complicated.1 This is a very irresponsible way

of shirking the duty by the trial Judge. This appeal by the

plaintiffs is from that Judgment.

The 7th-11th defendants have stated that the land to be partitioned

is a portion of a larger land. The District Judge has clung on that

point to dismiss the action. However no reason which could be

understood by this Court has been given to come to that

conclusion. He has, in one sentence, stated what the said

defendants have stated2, but has not stated whether he accepts

that position and why he accepts that position and how it affects

the maintainability of the partition action.

The District Judge has also just stated that the plaintiffs pedigree

is fragile without elaborating it.3

1 Vide last paragraph of page 3 of the Judgment. 2 Vide paragraph 2 of page 3 of the Judgment. 3 Vide paragraph 3 of page 3 of the Judgment.

A Judge in the Judgment cannot come to conclusions without

giving reasons. If the conclusions are without reasons they cannot

be treated as conclusions. If reasons are not given, there is no way

the Appellate Court can test the correctness of that conclusion.

Although altogether 17 issues have been raised, the District Judge

has answered only 7 issues.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court dated 12.07.2000

and direct the incumbent District Judge to deliver the Judgment

afresh on the evidence already led. In order to assist the Court,

counsel for both parties can be given an opportunity to file written

submissions prior to the delivery of the Judgment.

Appeal allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
