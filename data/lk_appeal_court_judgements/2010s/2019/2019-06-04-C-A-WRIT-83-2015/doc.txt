Petitioner

CASE NO: CA/WRIT/83/2015

Vs.

The Director of Pensions,

Department of Pensions,

Maligawatta,

Colombo 10.

And 11 Others

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Luxman Amarasinghe for the Petitioner.

Nayomi Kahavita, S.C., for the Respondents.

Decided on: 03.06.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash P24 by

certiorari and compel the respondents by mandamus to absorb

the petitioner for Technical Service or Para Medical Salary Group

and pay the arrears of salary and pension to the petitioner from

the date of appointment in 1993.

The respondents jointly filed objections to this application, but

did not file written submissions at the end of the argument.

Whilst the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on

the Judgment of this Court in CA/Writ/407/2009, the learned

State Counsel placed reliance on the Judgment of this Court in

CA/Writ/133/2015 (against which a leave to appeal application

has been filed before the Supreme Court). However a copy of the

latter Judgment has not been tendered for perusal of the Court.

The petitioner is a retired public servant whose appointment was

the Driver Overseer to serve in the Anti-Malaria Campaign under

the Ministry of Health. (vide P1) According to the petitioner the

cadre for that special post was about 5 for whole Sri Lanka, and

they were assigned unique duties (vide P3 and P6) which are not

handled and expected from a public servant appointed as a

Driver, whichever the Grade may be.

The petitioners complaint is that according to the Public

Administration Circular No.96 marked P10, although Driver

Overseer is a separate Grade having a separate salary structure,

he was not paid that salary after he was absorbed to the

Provincial Public Service of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial

Council.

In the subsequent circulars issued regarding Salaries and

Cadres, the Post/Grade of Driver Overseer has been omitted.

Whether it was deliberate or accidental is not clear. Sometimes

as there were handful of public servants of that Post, the

authorities might have accidently omitted to accommodate them

in the subsequent circulars. If it was deliberate, there shall be

some decision taken to annul that Post and at least absorbing

them into a different category/post. There is nothing on record,

and the matter is in limbo.

In this regard, the petitioner has, by a spate of letters tendered

with the petition, complained to the authorities to rectify this

salary anomaly without success.

However the Director Establishment has attempted to rectify

this anomaly but could not pursue until the end due to lack of

assistance on the part of the Health Ministry. (vide P18, P19)

By P23, the Provincial Director of Health Services of

Sabaragamuwa, having inter alia considered the duties of the

Driver Overseer has recommended to the Secretary to the

Provincial Health Ministry of Sabaragamuwa to calculate the

salary of the petitioner in terms of the salary code relevant to the

Sri Lanka Technical Service.

The Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province by P37 has

directed the Secretary of the Chief Minister of the

Sabaragamuwa Province to decide the appropriate salary scale

to the post of Driver Overseer and pay the salaries accordingly.

Thereafter this matter has been referred to the National Salaries

and Cadres Commission and the Secretary thereof by letter

marked P24 has informed the Chief Secretary of the

4

Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council that the payment of salary

according to the salary scale for Driver Grade 1 to the petitioner

at the time of retirement is correct, and no different salary scale

can be recommended. P24 does not clarify why there was an

unexplained discontinuation of the special salary scale identified

for the Driver Overseers by Public Administration Circular

marked P10. They in my view owe an explanation both to the

petitioner and to the Court for such deviation. This has not

been done.

Another Bench of this Court, with the agreement of a different

State Counsel, in CA/Writ/ 407/2009 has placed another Driver

Overseer similarly circumstanced, in the salary scale of TB 3-4-4

of the Sri Lanka Technical Service for the calculation of the

pension. Notwithstanding that settlement was personal to that

petitioner and recorded not to be regarded as a precedent in

future cases, I see no reason not to come to the same conclusion

in the unique facts and circumstances of a very few (according

to the petitioner about 5 for the whole island) public servants

appointed as Driver Overseers who have rendered a yeoman

service in difficult circumstances in the past.

For the aforesaid reasons, I quash P24 decision and direct the

respondents by mandamus to place the petitioner in the salary

scale of TB 3-4-4 of the Sri Lanka Technical Service for the

calculation of the salary and pension and pay the arrears

accordingly. No costs.
