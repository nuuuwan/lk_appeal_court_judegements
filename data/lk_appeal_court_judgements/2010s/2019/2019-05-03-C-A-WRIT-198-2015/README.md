And 9 Others

Respondents.

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner and the 9th respondents are siblings. After a

partition action, their ancestral home has fallen into the lots

allotted to both of them. The electricity meter had been in the

part of the house which went to the petitioner. As seen from

5R1, the electricity connection has been given in the name of the

9th respondent. 5R1 dated 24.03.1986 is a legally enforceable

Agreement entered into between the 5th respondent-Lanka

Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO) and the 9th

respondent. In the meantime, as seen from 5R2 dated

11.03.2014, upon a written request made by the petitioner from

the LECO, the name of the Electricity Account has been changed

from the 9th respondent to the petitioner. In 5R2 the petitioner

has specifically stated that, once the name change is made, if

his brother-the 9th respondent objects to it, he is aware that the

LECO would again change it in the name of his brother, and he

has no objection to it. By 5R5 and 5R6 the 9th respondent has

objected to it, and therefore, the LECO has changed it in the

name of his brother-the 9th respondent. This has been ratified

by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. The Public

Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka has informed it to the

petitioner by 5R10 and the LECO has informed it to the

petitioner by P23.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash P23 by

way of writ of certiorari and to compel the LECO by way of writ

of mandamus to change the Electricity Account in his name.

This application is ex facie devoid of any merit. The matters

heavily rely on by the petitioner such as the assessment rates to

the house are paid by the petitioner, the part of the house which

went to the 9th respondents lot after the partition case is

inhabitable are beside the point. The central document in this

case is the Agreement marked 5R1. The LECO has done nothing

illegal by changing the name of the Account to the former

position upon objections being received from the former owner.

As seen from 5R2, this is not at all an arbitrary decision. Hence

P23 is entirely in order. The Court has no right to force the

LECO to change the name of the Electricity Account in violation

of the said Agreement.

There is absolutely no public duty on the part of the LECO to

change the name of the Account as the petitioner urges to do.

Nor has the petitioner any legal right to insist on the LECO to do

so.

Writ will not issue for private purposes. This is a private dispute

between two brothers arising out of an Agreement entered into

between the LECO and the petitioners brother marked 5R1 and

the subsequent arrangement made by LECO on the promise

given by the petitioner through 5R2.

In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte [1984] 1 Sri

LR 195 at 199 a Full Bench of the Supreme Court stated:

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty,

in the performance of which an applicant has sufficient

legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus the duty to

4

be performed must be of a public nature and not of merely

private character.

The Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say

for the enforcement of a mere private duty stemming from a

contract or otherwise. Contractual duties are enforceable by

the ordinary contractual remedies such as damages,

specific performance or injunction. They are not enforceable

by Mandamus which is confined to public duties and is not

granted where there are other adequate remedies.

In De Silva v. Sri Lanka Telecom [1995] 2 Sri LR 38 the telephone

of the petitioner was disconnected as the bills were not settled.

The petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to quash the said

decision and a mandamus on the Director of Communications to

restore the facility. A preliminary objection was taken to the

maintainability of the application on the ground that as there is

a contractual relationship between the parties writ does not lie.

Whilst upholding that objection and dismissing the application

in limine this Court at page 41 held that:

Learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the

agreement to provide a telephone line is one entered into in

pursuance of a statutory duty to provide telephone facilities

and this application does not fall within the province of pure

contract but within the realm of the statutory function of a

statutory body. I am unable to accept this submission. The

decision sought to be quashed is a decision founded purely

on contract. The telephone was disconnected for failure to

settle the outstanding bills as provided for in the agreement.

This was a decision taken wholly within the context of the

5

contractual relationship between the parties and not in the

exercise of the powers of a public authority. Neither Certiorari

nor Mandamus will lie to remedy the grievances arising from

an alleged breach of contract.

I unhesitatingly dismiss the application of the petitioner. The

petitioner shall pay a sum of Rs.50,000/= as costs to the State.
