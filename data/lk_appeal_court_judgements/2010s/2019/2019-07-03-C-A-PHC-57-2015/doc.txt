The 15t Respondent-Appellant (Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabhawa), filed this

application against the Petitioner-Respondents (Respondents) seeking, inter alia, a

mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the learned

Page 2of9

High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Rathnapura, dated 02nd April

2015, permitting the Petitioner-Respondents to remove obstructions to the

roadway existing upon the land depicted as Lot 3 in Plan No. 1848/04, dated

17.11.2004, made by S. Ramakrishnan, Licensed Surveyor, marked P2.

The Respondents submit that the land depicted as lot No. 3 of Plan No.

1848/04 has a 34 acre paddy filed called "Korawakwila" and observed that the

Appellant is in the process of constructing a roadway upon it to facilitate access to

the said paddy land in spite of having many other access roads. However, it is

admitted by the Respondents that occasionally the villagers were permitted to

move their agricultural machinery over the said land but denied the existence of a

servitude right.

Respondents received letter dated 1 i h September 2013, marked P7, where

the Appellants stated that due to the existence of a thoroughfare upon the said land

the fence erected obstructing its free passage should be removed, in default, action

would be taken in terms of Section 59 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act.

According to 'P7' the Appellant informed the Respondents that, as per the

Final Village Plan bearing No. 227, dated 3rd September 2012 (marked P6), the

said road is a common road and the villagers have been using it for a considerable

period of time.

The learned High Court Judge Rathnapura in his judgment stated that the

Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabha has not produced the relevant Gazette notification in

Page 3 of9

compliance with Section 24(5) of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act with regard to the

purported roadway and held that, unless there is a declared roadway, the

Pradeshiya Sabha will not have any power to act under Section 59(1) of the

Pradeshiya Sabhas Act to have any control of the said roadway.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both Counsels agreed to

dispose of this application by way of written submissions.

The Respondents have argued that, Section 59 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas

Act empowers only to remove obstructions of a public thoroughfare under its

control and therefore, cannot act without lawful authority in constructing a

roadway.

Section 59(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, which provides for removal of

obstructions or encroachments to public thoroughfares, states,

"It shall be lawful for any Pradeshiya Sabha through any person

authorized by the Pradeshiya Sabha in that behalf, to give orders

verbally or by notice in writing, to any person obstructing or

encroaching upon any thoroughfare under the control of the Pradeshiya

Sabha forthwith to remove or abate the obstruction or encroachment;

and if any person to whom such order is given refuses or neglects to

comply therewith within a reasonable time, or, if there be any doubt as

to who is the proper person to whom such order should be given after

such notice has been affixed for a reasonable time to such obstruction

Page 4 of 9

or encroachment, it shall be lawful for the Pradeshiya Sabha to cause

any such obstruction or encroachment to be forthwith removed or

abated. "

It is observed that the Pradeshiya Sabha has power to remove obstructions

to any thoroughfare "under the control of the Pradeshiya Sabha". However this

section emphasizes a pre-condition that the particular thoroughfare must be under

the control of the Pradeshiya Sabha. As per document marked P7, it is revealed

that, the 1 st Respondent- Appellant identified the said road as a common road and

not as a public thoroughfare existing under the control of the Pradeshiya Sabhas

Act.

It is further observed that, since the said thoroughfare is not under the

'control' of the Pradeshiya Sabha, it cannot derive any authority under Section

59(1), even if there is an obstruction to it.

Section 23 of the said Act states that,

"All thoroughfares within the Pradeshiya Sabha area, other than

principal th~roughfares, except in so far as such thoroughfares are

already vested by virtue of any other enactment, shall be deemed to be

vested in the Pradeshiya Sabha of that area. "

However, as per the requirement of Section 24 of the Act, such Pradeshiya

Sabha within 3 months of its setting-up, must demarcate and prepare plans of the

Page 5 of9

thoroughfares. Thereafter, it must publish notices setting out such list that are

within the area as per the provisions of Section 24( 1), which states;

(1) It shall be the duty of every Pradeshiya Sabha within three years of the

coming into force of these provisions or within such further period as may

in the special circumstances of any case be allowed by the Minister

(a) to demarcate by permanent marks the limits of the roads and paths

maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabha and cause to be prepared plans of all

such roads and paths; and

(b) to cause notices to be published in the prescribed manner setting out a list

of such roads and paths.

Sub-sections (2)-(4) of Section 24 of the Act provides detailed steps to

finalize such plans by the Pradeshiya Sabha, while making a proper mechanism to

protect the rights of the victims affected by such demarcations and plans.

(2) Upon the publication of such notices any party claiming to be the owner of

land from which such road or path has been demarcated shall within the

time prescribed by such notice institute action in the appropriate court for

establishing his title to such land.

(3) After the expiration of a period of three months and before the expiration

of a period of six months from the date on which the notice under Sub-

section (1) is published in the Gazette, the Pradeshiya Sabha shall cause to

Page 6 of9

be published a notice in the prescribed manner setting out a list of all such

roads and paths as set out in the notice published under Sub-section (1).

(a) excluding those roads and paths or portions of roads and paths in

respect of which no final determination had been made in any action

instituted as required by Sub-section (2); and

(b) with the necessary alterations made in the demarcation of the limits

of such roads and paths and in such plans in respect of which a final

determination had been made in any action instituted as required by

Sub-section (2).

(4) Where a final determination has been made on any action instituted as

required by Sub-section (2) after the publication of the notice under Sub-

section (3), the Pradeshiya Sabha shall cause a notice, to be published in

the prescribed manner, setting out a supplementary list of such roads and

paths or portions of roads and paths. Before the publication of this notice

the necessary alterations shall be made in the demarcation of the limits of

the roads and paths and in the plans on the basis of the final determination

,

made in respect of any action instituted as required by Sub-section (2).

Therefore, according to Section 24 Sub-section (5), it is very clear that until

and unless the Pradeshiya Sabha complies with the above sections, thoroughfares

could not be deemed to be vested to the relevant Pradeshiya Sabha.

Page 7 of9

Section 24(5) states;

(5) Upon the publication of such notice under sub-section (3) or (4), all such

roads and paths or portions of such roads and paths as defined in such

notices and depicted by such plans shall be deemed to be vested in the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

It is noted that there is no gazette notification published by the Appellant of

complying with the said provisions of Section 24 of the Act regarding the

existence of a thoroughfare upon the land depicted as Lot. 3 of the said Plan No.

1848/04, marked P2.

Although the 1st Respondent-Appellant contended that there is a roadway

upon the said land, the Appellant has failed to provide any material to substantiate

their position as to the existence of such roadway. We also observe that the said

survey plan has not identified any thoroughfare over Lot 3. According to letter

dated 24.05.2014, marked Pll, S. Ramakrishnan, Licensed Surveyor has stated, "]

did not layout a road through Lot. 3 and there was no such road at the time of my

survey".

Accordingly, it is noted that there is no Gazette notification published in

terms of Section 24(5) of the Act regarding the existence of a thoroughfare upon

the land depicted as Lot. 3 of Plan No. 1848/04 and therefore, the Appellant

cannot claim that the said thoroughfare is vested in the said Pradeshiya Sabha in

terms of Section 5 9( 1) of the Act.

( In the circumstances I have no reason to disagree with the learned High

Court Judge's analysis of the legality of letter marked P7, and the order granting

relief to the Respondents as prayed for.

Accordingly, the Application is dismissed without costs.
