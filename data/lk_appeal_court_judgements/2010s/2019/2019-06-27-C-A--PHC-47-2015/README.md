This is an appeal by the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(Appellant) against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Southern

Province holden at Matara, dated 30103/2015, dismissing the revision application

and affirming the order of the learned Magistrate of Morawaka.

The officer-in-charge of the Morawaka police instituted action in the

Magistrates Court by filing an information report under Section 66(1)(a) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act), over a disputed right of way between the

Appellant and the 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent). The learned

Magistrate having inquired into the compliant, by order dated 15/07/2013, held

that the Respondent has not satisfied Court that he was entitled to enjoy the right

of way to access his land, as claimed.

The Appellant submits that, he has restricted this application only to the

issue of the right of way, which is depicted as 'H' in the sketch, prepared by the

police attached to the information report. The Appellant has used the roadway

which is 3 feet wide and 200 feet in length over the land depicted in documents

marked 1Va12, 1Va13 and 1Va14, which the Respondent claims to be the only

access to his land. However contrary to the above position, in plan No. 260,

depiction 'C', in document marked 1 Va13, and in the observations made by the

police officer inquiring into the dispute has made reference to a 2-meter wide

alternate roadway to the land belonging to the Respondent. It is also observed by

the affidavit submitted by the Appellant and the observations of the police officer

that the roadway claimed by the Appellant is a re-constructed fleet of steps which

facilitate the flow of rain water.

4

The learned Magistrate having taken into consideration the use of the

roadway has concluded that the Appellant has failed to establish that the right of

way claimed had been used for a long period of time.

In consideration of Section 69( 1) of the Act, the Supreme Court In

Ramaiingam vs. Thangaraja (1982) 2 SLR 699, held that;

"if the dispute is in regard to a right to any land other than right to

possession of such land, the question for decision, according to Section

69(1), is who is entitle to the right which is subject of dispute. The world

"entitle" here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to

determine which of the parties acquired that right, or is entitled for the

time being to exercise that right. "

In Siriyawathi Jayasinghe vs. K.A. Karunaratne, CA. No. 863190, the

Court held that,

"in this case the r t Respondent claiming a servitude or a right of way

over the Petitioner's land has to prove that he is entitle to such a right

and mere user will not determine the dispute. "

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate correctly evaluated the evidence

brought before Court, when deciding that the Respondent has failed to establish a

right to a roadway and by doing so has not prejudiced any right or interest in the

land which a party may establish in a civil suit.

5

In the said background, it is the view of this Court that the Appellant has

failed to prove to the satisfaction of Court the right to the said roadway.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent has also taken up an objection that

the Appeal filed in the instant application has been signed by an Attorney-at-Law

without revoking the proxy in force and therefore, has no legal status to file this

application. The basis of this objection is that there cannot be two registered

Attorneys to function at the same time for a party in an action.

In Silva vs. Cumarathunga 40 NLR 139, the Court held that,

"a Petition of appeal must be signed by the proctor, whose proxy is on

the record at the date on which the Petition is filed. "

"if a proxy has been filed, 'his Attorney-at-Law' refers to the Attorney-at-Law on

record. Until the proxy is revoked, neither the Appellant nor any other Attorney

can sign the Petition of Appeal. According to Rule 2(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal

(Procedure for Appeals from High Courts established by Article 154P of the

Constitution) Rules of 1988, appeal shall be lodged in the High Court with the

Petition of Appeal addressed to the Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal originates

in the High Court and the High Court transmits the case record to the Court of

Appeal. Appeal proceedings in the Court of Appeal are a continuation of the

proceedings commenced in the High Court. Therefore the Attorney on record shall

sign the Petition of Appeal and it cannot be done by any other Attorney. "

[Fernando v. Sybil Fernando (1997) 3 SLR 1 (SC) and Jeevani Investments

(Pvt) Ltd. v. Wijesena Perera (2008) 1 SLR 207 (SC)J

In National Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Violet (2002) 3 SLR 337,

Somawansa J. held that;

"when there is an attorney-at-law on record it is such attorney-at-law

who could lodge an appeal. "

For the above reason alone, this Appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-
