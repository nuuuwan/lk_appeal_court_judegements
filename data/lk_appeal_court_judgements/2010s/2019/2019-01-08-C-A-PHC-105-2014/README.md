Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal from an order dated 27.08.2014 made by the learned High Court judge of the

North Western Province holden in Chilaw.

The argument in this matter began on 04.05.2018. However, on 10.12.2018 parties informed

Court that they will abide by the submissions already made in case no. CA(PHC) 116/2015 and

be bound by the judgement to be delivered in that case as the issues in the two cases are the

same.

We have today delivered judgment in CA(PHC) 116/2015 allowing the appeal and setting aside

the order dated 14.07.2015 made by the learned High Court judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw.

Accordingly, for the reasons set out more fully in the said judgment, we allow this appeal and

set aside order dated 27.08.2014 made by the learned High Court judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw.
