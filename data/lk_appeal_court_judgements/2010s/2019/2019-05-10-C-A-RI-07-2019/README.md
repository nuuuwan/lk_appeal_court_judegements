Samayawardhena, J.

Learned counsel for the petitioner was extensively heard.

The 1st defendant-petitioner has filed this application for

restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside (as seen from the reliefs

prayed for in the prayer to the petition) the Judgment of the

District Court pronounced as far back in 1979 and the

Interlocutory Decree entered thereon and to order trial de novo.

The 1st defendant in the petition has mentioned a spate of

(vague, as opposed to specific) grounds seeking to set aside the

Judgment entered 40 years ago.

However, the main complaint of the learned counsel for the 1st

defendant is that the District Judge in his Judgment has

partitioned a land larger to the one described in the schedule to

the plaint, and therefore the Judgment cannot be allowed to

stand.

After the pronouncement of the Judgment, the 1st defendant has

come before this Court by way of final appeal against the said

Judgment mainly on the same ground as seen from the Petition

of Appeal found in the Brief. Although a copy of the Appeal

Judgment is not found in the Brief, the learned counsel for the

1st defendant admits that the appeal was dismissed by this

Court.

If that is the position, the 1st defendant cannot, so many years

after the said dismissal, again come before this Court by way of

restitutio in integrum seeking the same relief basically on the

same ground. That is plan law.

3

I must also add that the 1st defendant cannot come before this

Court challenging the Judgment even on any other ground as a

party to an action cannot challenge a Judgment in piecemeal,

i.e. one point at a time. He must challenge the Judgment once

and for all, taking up all the grounds of appeal in one appeal.

The learned counsel for the 1st defendant now informs Court

that the immediate reason for the first defendant to come before

this Court was the order of the learned District Judge dated

16.08.2017 (JE No.206) whereby the application of the plaintiff

to have delivery of possession of the Lot allotted by the Final

Decree has been allowed.

When inquired why that order is erroneous, the learned counsel

says that by the Final Plan the corpus has been further

expanded, which is not permissible. If that is the basis upon

which that order is challenged, the 1st defendant could have

complained it to the District Judge at the Scheme Inquiry held

in terms of section 36 of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977, before

the confirmation of the Final Partition Plan. It is after the

confirmation of the Final Partition Plan, under section 36(1)(b),

the Final Decree is entered. Routine orders under section 52 for

delivery of possession are made on the Final Decree. If the 1st

defendant has not participated at the Scheme Inquiry, he

himself has to blame for it.

On the other hand, even assuming what the 1st defendant says

is correct (i.e. a land larger than the one stated in the

Judgment/Interlocutory Decree is shown in the Final Plan), that

cannot be a ground to aside the Judgment (which is the

substantive relief sought by the 1st defendant in this

application).

4

The 1st defendant shall go before the High Court of Civil Appeal

if there is any specific order which he thinks has been

erroneously made against him. If he is dissatisfied with the

order of the High Court of Civil Appeal, he cannot come before

this Court canvassing that order. In terms of section 5C of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.19 of

1990 amended by the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provinces) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, only the Supreme

Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to set aside

Judgments/Orders of the High Court of Civil Appeal.

This application is clearly devoid of merit.

We refuse to issue notice on the respondents and dismiss the

application.
