A.H.M.D. Nawaz. J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant who had purchased the 241/420th share of the subject-matter in th~

action instituted this partition action against the 1st Defendant-Respondent and in th~

plaint dated 04.09.1992, the Plaintiff-Appellant acknowledged the 1st Defendant-

Respondent as a co-owner and allotted 99/420 share in the corpus. Both the Plaintiff and lSi

Defendant admit that one Janish Fernando was the original owner who had seven children

Both the Plaintiff-Appellant and 1st Defendant-Respondent trace their title to their sham

in the land, through the chain of title that had devolved on the seven children of the original

owner-Janish Fernando.

It has to be noted that the Plaintiff-Appellant-Premaseeli purchased her interest in the lane

by a Deed bearing No.157 of 12.05.1992 (PI), whilst the 1st Defendant-Respondent had long

been there on the land subsequent to her purchase of her share in the land by a Deed bearing

No.5591 of 18.05.1964 (P2). If one looks at the chronology of events in the case, the lSi

Defendant-Respondent had entered the land as a co-owner on 18.05.1964, which is referabl~

to a lawful title acquired on 18.05.1964 by P2.

It is in evidence that though the 1st Defendant-Respondent became only a co-owner of th~

land in question on 18.05.1964, she had been in exclusive possession of the entire land and

in fact the 1st Defendant-Respondent had allowed the Plaintiff's husband to occupy one oj

the houses on the land namely the house bearing No.12/34 which belonged to the lSi

Defendant. In other words, the Plaintiff-Appellant had entered the house 12/34 with th~

leave and license of the 1st Defendant as an occupier under the leave and licence given to her

husband by the 1st Defendant. This testimony of the 1st Defendant was not contradicted at

all.

In any event, the Plaintiff-Appellant acquired title to her share of the land on 12.05.1992 b}

purchasing a right in the land by Deed No.157 and filed this partition action four month~

later on 04.09.1992. Her predecessors in title, all being the heirs of the original owner, hac

never been in possession of the portion of the land that passed to the Plaintiff-Premaseeli

and though the Plaintiff alleged that she became a co-owner of the subject-matter oj

3

partition action on 12.05.1992, the basis on which the 1st Defendant filed her joint answer i~

that she had long prescribed to the land in question since 1964.

In other words, by the time the Plaintiff acquired her title to her share in the land, thE

contention of the 1st Defendant is that she had prescribed to the land since 1964 to thE

exclusion of all the other owners inclusive of the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff

Respondent.

It falls to be determined whether the possession of the 1st Defendant became adverse to thE

interests of all the co-owners inclusive of the predecessors in title of the Plaintiff

Respondent. The argument of the 1st Defendant is that long before the Plaintiff-Appellant

acquired ownership in land on 12.05.1992, she had became the owner of the entire land by

prescription and if that argument were to prevail against the acquisition of paper title b}

the Plaintiff, the law relating to prescription among co-owners has to be examined.

The original owner admittedly had seven children and it is from some of them that the IS

Defendant had derived her title in 1964. None of the seven children of the original owner OJ

their issues had been in possession of the land and no one from among them came forward

to give evidence. There is evidence that since 1964 the 1st Defendant had been in possessior

of the land.

The law on prescription among co-owners operates on the basis of ouster (Corea v. Iseri1

Appuhamy 15 N.LR 65) or presumption of ouster ( Tillekeratne v. Bastian 21 N.LR 12)

Since the 1st Defendant entered the land, though it was after he had bought a fractional shan

in the land, he had been in possession of the entirety of the land.

Evidence has been led that the 1st Defendant built houses all over the land and let one oj

them to the husband of the Plaintiff as a licensee. None of the co-owners had objected to the

construction of these houses and there has been total abandonment of the land on their part

until some of the grandchildren of the original owner sold a fractional share to the Plaintiff

who was the wife of the licensee of the 1st Defendant, in 1972. Between 1964 and 1972, 2E

years had lapsed and it was long before 1972, the houses had built by the 1st Defendant.

4

The 1st Defendant collected the rents from the husband of the Plaintiff and he also filed

action to eject the husband. There was no evidence given by the vendors to warrant and

defend the title of the Plaintiff. It was just four months after the purchase in 1972 that the

Plaintiff filed this partition action. The assertion of the 1st Defendant that he had adversel}

possessed this land for 28 years has not been rebutted and his acts have not been challenged

at any stage by any co-owners.

In fact, I recognize the fact that when a person buys a fractional share in a co-owned land

he is deemed to continue in that capacity but his possession may become adverse to thf

others when some act of ouster or some definite facts from which one could infer a changf

in the character of the Defendant's intention with regard to the holding of the land an

established.

It will be sufficient for this purpose to adopt the definition given in Smith's Leading CaseE

that "adverse possession" is "possession held in a character incompatible with the claimant' ~

title" -see Bertram C. J. in Tillekeratane vs. Bastian (supra).

As regards long possession of the property by one co-owner uninterrupted by other co

owners, Bertram Cj. gives an example as follows: "If it is found that one co-owner and hi~

predecessors in interest have been in possession of the whole property for a period as fa!

back as reasonable memory reaches; that he and they have done nothing to recognize the

claims of the other co-owners; that he and they have taken the whole produce of thf

property for themselves; and that these co-owners have never done anything to assert a

claim to any share of the produce, it is artificial in the highest degree to say that such a

person and his predecessors in interest must be presumed to be possessing all this time in

the capacity of co-owners, and that they can never be regarded as having possessed

adversely, simply because no definite positive act can be painted to as originating OJ

demonstrating the adverse possession. Where it is found that, presumptions of law lead tc

such an artificial result, it will generally be found that the law itself provides a remedy fOJ

such a situation by means of counter-presumptions. If such a thing were not possible, laV'.

would in many cases become out of hannony with justice and good sense".

5

De Sampayo J. puts the matter thus:- "While a co-owner may, without any interference oj

acquiescence in an adverse claim allow such natural produce as the fruits of trees to be taken

by the other co-owners the aspect of things will not be the same in the case where valuablf

minerals are taken a long series of years without any division in kind or money".

The Courts have recognized other circumstances from which a presumption of ouster may

be drawn but that has never been done where the only circumstance consists of lon~

continued possession where the other co-owners are also in possession of other allotment~

of the same land.

The position is different where one co-owner is in possession of the entire common land and

does not account for or share with his other co-owners the income derived therefrom. FOJ

instance, in Subramaniam vs. Sivarajah 46 N.LR 540 the Court presumed an ouster frOIT.

the fact that one co-owner was in possession of the entire land and took the profit~

exclusively and continuously for a period of over 60 years without accounting to the other

co-owners who lived in close proximity under circumstances which indicated a denial of a

right in any other co-owners to take or receive them.

So when the 1st Defendant seeks to establish a prescriptive title against another by reason

of his long- continued exclusive possession, it depends on the circumstances of each caSf

whether it is reasonable to presume an ouster from such exclusive possession.

I find in this case that until some of the grandchildren of the original owner who had

themselves no possession in the land sold a fractional share to the Plaintiff in 1992, the lSi

Defendant had encountered no opposition on the land and it is arguable that the Plaintill

may have bought this property from people who had long lost title to their fractional sham

by virtue of prescriptive title that the 1st Defendant had already acquired to the land.

6

In Abdul Majeed vs. Ummu Zaneera 61 N.LR 361 K.D. de Silva J held:

"In considering whether or not a presumption of ouster should be drawn by reason of long

continued possession alone, of the property owned in common, it is relevant to consider th

follOwing, among other matters:-

(a) The income derived from the property,

(b) The value of the property,

(c)The relationship of the co-owners and where they reside in relation to the situation

of the property,

(d) Documents executed on the basis of exclusive ownership".

H.N.G. Fernando J. in this case states: "Firstly, section 3 (of the Prescription Ordinance;

imposes rwo requirements: "undisturbed and uninterrupted possession" and "possession by

a title adverse and independent "; secondly, the question whether 'the second of these

requirements is satisfied does not arise unless the first of them has been proved. It is cleal

from the judgment of the Privy Council in Corea's case (supra) that a co-owner in possessior

can satisfy the second requirement in two different modes:-

(a) by prOviding that his entry was not by virtue of his title as a co-owner, but rather of som

other claim of title; in fact Their Lordships, in Corea's case, rejected the finding of the

Supreme Court that the possessor had entered as sole heir of the former owner;

(b) by proving that, although his entry was by virtue of his lawful title as a co-owner

nevertheless he had put an end to his possession in that capacity by ouster or something

equivalent to ouster, and that therefore and thereafter his possession had been by an advers

or independent title".

From the evidence led in this case I take the view that sufficient evidence has been led by

the 1st Defendant to establish that she had prescribed to the entirety of the land and no dou bl

the ratio decidendi of Corea vs. Appuhamy (supra) is that a person entering as a co-owner intc

possession of the common property cannot, by merely fOrming a secret intention which ha~

7

not been communicated to his other co-owners either by express declarations or by overt

action, alter the character of his possession and thereby acquire title to their shares by

prescription. This principle is, of course, subject to the rule of common sense that, in

appropriate cases, an ouster may be presumed to have taken place at some point of tim~

after the date of entry which was not originally adverse. Tillekeratne vs. Bastian (supra).

Upon a perusal of the totality of evidence led in the case, I take the view that possession of

the 1st Defendant has gone beyond mere possession in the case and I see no reason to disturl:

the decision of the learned Judge of Moratuwa dated 18.10.2000.

Thus I affirm the judgment and dismiss the appeal.
