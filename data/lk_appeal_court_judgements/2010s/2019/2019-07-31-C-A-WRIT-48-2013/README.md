Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was at all times material to this application a Platoon Commander of the Sri Lanka

Corps of Military Police in the rank of Second Lieutenant. He complains that based on the

allegation of a breach of discipline concerning the alleged illicit relationship he had with another

woman soldier certain acts were done which culminated in a recommendation been made to the

H.E. the President to withdraw the commission of the Petitioner.

Page 3 of 6

The Petitioner claims that only a Court of Inquiry took place in relation to the alleged act and that

no recommendation can be made to withdraw the commission without the finding of guilt at a

Court Martial. He further contends that even the Court of Inquiry was held violating the principles

of natural justice as he did not get a proper opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses

testifying before the Court of Inquiry.

Suppression/Misrepresentation of Material Facts

It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without going into the merits

if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts. It is necessary in this

context to refer to the following passage from the judgment of Pathirana J in W. S. Alphonso

Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [77 N.L.R. 131 at 135,6J:

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the

Court when, an application for a writ or injunction, is made and the process of the Court

is invoked is laid down in the case ofthe King v. The General Commissioner for the Purpose

of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmarbd de Poigns

Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable

to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the

merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or

misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the

decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of material facts by the

applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of prohibition

without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for

a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would not go into the

merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination".

This principle has been consistently applied by courts in writ applications as well. [Hulangamuwa

v. Siriwardena [(1986) 1 SrLL.R.275], Collettes Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour [(1989) 2 SrLL.R. 6],

Laub v. Attorney General [(1995) 2 SrLL.R. 88], Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Wilfred Van Els

[(1997) 1 SrLL.R. 360], Jayasinghe v. The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering

[(2002) 1 SrLL.R. 277] and Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore Dharmasiriwardene

& Others [(2007) 1 SrLL.R. 24J.

Page 4 of 6

In fact, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others [(2005) 1

SrLL.R. 67J this Court held that if there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the

Court would not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination.

In Fonseka v. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others [(2011) 2 SrLL.R. 372J a divisional

bench of this Court held that a petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extra-ordinary

remedy must in fairness to Court, bare every material fact so that the discretion of Court is not

wrongly invoked or exercised and that it is perfectly settled that a person who makes an ex parte

application to Court is under an obligation to make the fullest possible disclosure of all material

facts within his knowledge. It was further held that if there is anything like deception the Court

ought not to go in to the merits, but simply say "we will not listen to your application because of

what you have done'.

The Petitioner states that apart from the allegation in issue he holds a clear service record

throughout the entire 16 years of his military career and no such incident or wrong doing

whatsoever was recorded during his service [paragraph 19 of the petitionJ . However, the

Respondents have produced evidence to establish that the Petitioner was previously punished

after a summary trial for being absent without leave where he pleaded guilty and was

admonished and severely reprimanded (R8). That is a material misrepresentation/suppression on

the facts in this case and the application is liable to be dismissed on that ground alone without

going into the merits.

Futility

It is an established principle that since relief by way of judicial review is discretionary in nature

relief will be refused if the application is futile [Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera v. Liyanage (2003)

1 SrLL.R. 331J.

In this application it is clear that H.E. the President has approved the withdrawal of commission

of the Petitioner with effect from 30.06.2013 (R11). In fact, when this matter was supported for

interim relief on 19.03.2013 this Court refused interim relief on the basis that the

recommendation ofthe 1st Respondent had already been dispatched to H.E. the President. The

Petitioner himself admits that this application will be rendered nugatory if H.E. the President were

to withdraw his commission prior to the determination of this application [paragraph 29 of the

petitionJ.

Page 50f6

This Court has on previous occasions refused to intervene by way of judicial review where H.E.

the President has withdrawn the commission [Air Vice Marshall Elma Perera v. Liyanage (supra),

Captain Sunil Pathirana v. Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya (C.A. Writ Application No.

614/2011, C.A.M . 06.07.2015), Lt. Cdr. Pathirage v. Vice admiralJayantha Perera and Others (C.A.

Writ Application No. 689/2011, C.A.M . 14.02.2019)).

Mr. Manohara Jayasinghe the learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents, acting in

accordance with the highest traditions of the Attorney General's department drew the attention

of Court to the decision in Flying Officer Ratnayake v. Air Marshall Danald Perera and Others (C.A.

Writ Application No. 104/2005, C.A.M. 28.02.2007) where this Court has taken a contrary view. I

have considered this decision but am of the view that the better view is reflected in the cases

referred to above and that it is indeed a futile exercise to intervene by judicial review where the

commission has been withdrawn by H.E. the President particularly where the Petitioner himself

admits that it will be futile.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed with costs.
