Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action seeking partition of the land

described in the schedule to the plaint according to the

devolution of title set out in the plaint. After trial, the learned

District Judge pronounced the Judgment excluding Lot 2 of the

Preliminary Plan marked X from the corpus and partitioning the

land among the plaintiff and some of the defendants. It is

against this Judgment the 2nd and the 4th defendant-appellants

(appellants) have preferred this appeal.

The only point raised by the learned counsel for the appellants

at the argument was the exclusion of Lot 2 of the Preliminary

Plan from the corpus.

This Lot has been excluded in favour of the 23rd defendant on

prescription. The predecessor of the 23rd defendant had been

declared entitled to Lot E of Plan No. 2459 dated 27.08.1934

marked 23(a)V3 by the Partition Judgment dated 20.05.1952 in

Chilaw District Court Case No. 12447 marked 23(a)V2.

The Court Commissioner in the Report to the Preliminary Plan

marked Y inter alia reported to the Court as follows:

3

Lot 2-Extent 0A. 2R. 24P. This Lot represents Lot E of Plan

No. 2459 dated 27.8.1934 prepared by W.R.S. Fernando,

Licensed Surveyor, and is being occupied and claimed by

the 23rd defendant. The buildings appearing in this Lot

have been constructed by the 23rd defendant and remained

undisputed.

Plaintiff, 4th, 10th, 15th, 16th, 18th and 28th defendants

dispute the claim to the soil shares.

Under Chilaw DC Case No. 12774, a judgment has been

given. In this judgment the position of Plan No. 2459 dated

27.8.1934 prepared by W.R.S. Fernando, Licensed

Surveyor, has been clearly clarified. Surveyor W.R.S.

Fernando has given his statement regarding the

distribution of shares in his evidence for this case. Hence

to consult the judgment given in Case 12774 will assist

Court to ascertain correctly the implications involved in the

distribution of shares to the respective parties, and how the

parties have claimed soil rights to Lot 2.

Vegetation-26 coconut trees 20-40 years, 13 coconut trees

8-15 years, 1 tambili tree 10 years, 2 tambili trees about 5

years.

The Court Commissioner who prepared the Preliminary Plan has

given evidence at the trial confirming the said position. He has

in his evidence affirmatively stated that Plan No. 2459 marked

23(a)V3 was given to him at the preliminary survey and with his

wealth of experience of 43 years as a surveyor and Court

Commissioner he had no doubt that Lot E of the said Plan is

equal to Lot 2 of the Preliminary Plan notwithstanding no

superimposition was done.

4

The learned counsel for the appellants strenuously contended

before this Court that without a superimposition, the Court

Commissioner could not have come to that conclusion. In the

unique facts and circumstances of this case, I am unable to

agree with that contention.

This is not a case where the Court Commissioner for the first

time took up such a position in the witness box. He, before

parties tendered their statements of claim, expressly stated in

his Report to the Preliminary Plan that This Lot [Lot 2 of the

Preliminary Plan] represents Lot E of Plan No. 2459 dated

27.8.1934 prepared by W.R.S. Fernando, Licensed Surveyor.

According to section 18(2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977,

as amended, that constitutes evidence without further proof

subject to calling him, in terms of the proviso to section 18(2), as

a witness. I concede that it would have been better had there

been a superimposition on the application of the 23rd defendant.

But, if the appellants disputed the said position of the Court

Commissioner, they also could, as this is a partition action, have

got a commission issued for a superimposition.

It must be emphasized that the plaintiff did not dispute the said

fact, i.e. exclusion of Lot 2, by preferring an appeal. The reason

being, as I understand, the plaintiff or his predecessor was a

party to the other case No. 12447.

It is also significant to note that the substituted 23rd defendant

who gave evidence at the trial on exclusion of Lot 2 was never

cross-examined by the appellants on that point or any other

point.

5

At the argument, the learned counsel for the original 9th

defendant and learned counsel for the original 10th and 11th

defendants sought to challenge the Judgment basically on the

premise that the learned District Judge has failed to investigate

title to the land. The said defendants have not filed an appeal

against the Judgment nor made an application under section

772 of the Civil Procedure Code challenging the Judgment.

Hence they are not entitled to canvass the Judgment before this

Court. This is not a revision application.

I dismiss the appeal of the 2nd and 4th defendants. The

substituted 23rd defendant is entitled to costs of the appeal

recoverable from the appellants.
