Janak De Silva J.

The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated in Sri Lanka and its principal business

activity is the importation and selling of commercial vehicles and spare parts, after sale services

and other related services for motor vehicles.

The Appellant filed its return of income for the year of assessment 2009/2010 on 23rd November

2010. On or around 22nd October 2012 the assessor issued an intimation letter under section

163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (IR Act) stating that no deduction is allowable in

respect of two thirds of Nation Building Tax (NBT) paid by the Appellant at the customs point on

account of it being a prescribed levy or tax in terms of section 26(1)(I)(i) of the IR Act read with

Gazette Notification No. 1606/31 dated 19th June 2009.

On or around 30th November 2012 the Respondent issued an assessment on the Appellant for

the year of assessment 2009/2010. The Appellant appealed against the said assessment. The

Senior Commissioner-Secretariat made a determination on 22nd December 2014 which was

communicated by the Respondent to the Appellant by a letter dated 23rd December 2014. The

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAe) which confirmed the determination

made by the Respondent.

Page 2 of 11

The Appellant then moved the TAC to refer the following questions of law for the opinion of Court

in terms of section 170 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006:

(1) Was the assessment no. ITA 12301100040V1 dated 30th November 2012(which is the

subject matter of this appeal) invalid in law by reason of the previous assessment no.

6476576 VO dated 6th May 2011 having been issued in respect of the same year of

assessment 2009/2010?

(2) Was the assessment for the year 2009/2010 dated 30th November 2012 issued against

the Appellant in any case time barred in terms of Section 163(5)(a) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) (the "IRA") as applicable to such year of assessment?

(3) In terms of the IRA read together with the provisions of Extraordinary Gazette No.

1606/31 dated 19th June 2009

a. Is Nation Building Tax (NBT) paid at the time of importation of goods a "prescribed

tax or levy" for the purpose of section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRA; or

b. Is the NBT which is expensed in the financial statements of any person in an year

of assessment in accordance with accepted accounting principles a "prescribed

tax or levy" for the purposes of section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRA for a different year

of assessment?

The Appellant has in the written submissions informed Court that Question 1 is not being pursued

by the Appellant.

Time Bar

The facts relevant to this question is that the Appellant filed its income tax return for the year of

assessment 2009/2010 on 23rd November 2010. The assessor issued an assessment on the

Appellant for that year of assessment on 30th November 2012.

The provisions relating to the filing of returns and making of assessments are set out in sections

106(1) and 163(5) respectively of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (JR Act). Accordingly,

every person who is chargeable with income tax under this Act for any year of assessment shall,

on or before the thirtieth day of September immediately succeeding the end of that year of

assessment file a return and where the return is filed within this time, an assessment of the

Page 3 of 11

income tax payable by such person must be made before the expiry eighteen months from the

end of that year of assessment.

Sections 106(1) and 163(5) of the IR Act was amended by Act No. 19 of 2009 which resulted in

the filing of returns having to be done on or before the thirtieth day of November immediately

succeeding the end of that year of assessment and the assessment having to be done before the

expiry of two years from the end of that year of assessment.

Accordingly, the Appellant submits that any assessment relating to year of assessment

2009/2010 should have been issued before 3Pt March 2012 (i.e. 2 years after 3pt March 2010)

whereas it was issued only on 29th November 2012, which is almost 8 months after the deadline.

However, the learned State Counsel for the Respondent submits that this submission ignores the

amendment made to sections 106(1) and 163(5) of the IR Act by Act No. 22 of 2011. He submitted

that prior to the amendment the two-year period commenced on pt April i.e. the very date after

the conclusion of the year of assessment but after the amendment the commencement date was

changed to 30th November.

He further submitted that the Appellant submitted his return on 23 rd November 2010 at which

point the law in operation was the pre-20ll law according to which the two-year period within

which the notice of assessment must be sent would conclude on opt April 2012. It was submitted

that if there was no change in the legal regime then the Appellant was entitled to assume on 1st

April 2012 that his tax returns were accepted. However, the learned State Counsel submits that

after the Appellant submitted his return but very importantly before pt April 2012, the law was

amended as a result of which the deadline for sending out a notice of assessment to the Appellant

gets extended to 30th November 2012.

However, the learned counsel for the Appellant rejects this position and submitted that these

amendments would come into operation for the year of assessment 2011/2012 and not to the

previous year of assessment. In particular he directed the attention of court to the fact that the

amendment made in 2011 takes effect on 1 April 2011 which is significant as it shows that the

amendment was to take effect at the beginning of the year of assessment 2011/2012 although

certified on 31st March 2011.

Page 4 of 11

A similar issue arose sometime ago when the amendment to the IR Act in 2009 was the subject

matter in Seylan Bank PLC. v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [CA{Tax) 23/2013,

C.A.M. 23.05.2015]. In that case this Court held that irrespective of whether the assessee had to

submit the tax return on or before the 30th September or 30th November 2009, the assessor can

send the assessment to the assessee within two years immediately succeeding that year of

assessment. The Court further considered the amendments made to section 163 of the IR Act by

Act Nos. 22 of 2011, 18 of 2013 and 8 of 2014. It held that the two-year period given to the

assessor to send the assessment against the assessee was to start from the end of the year of

assessment originally, which is the 31st of March, every year. This date (the starting day of the

period) has been further pushed down to the thirtieth day of November of the immediately

succeeding year of assessment by Act No. 22 of 2011. The Court also held that section 163(5) of

the IR Act is a procedural law and that even if the amendment has retrospective effect, it applies,

if the amendment is only on procedural law.

Two judges sitting together as a rule follow the decision of two judges. Where two judges sitting

together find themselves unable to follow a decision of two judges, the practice in such cases is

also to reserve the case for the decision of a fuller bench [Walker Sons & Co. (UK) Ltd. v.

Gunatilake and others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri.loR. 231]. In any event, I am of the view that the

reasoning in Seylan Bank PLC. v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) is sound

and compelling and sets out the correct position in law.

I only wish to add that it is a recognized principle that in fiscal legislation it is a matter for the

legislature to decide what consideration relating to the amelioration of hardship or to the

interests of the economic progress of the people should be given effect to and economic

considerations in respect of which such decisions are made must be largely left to the legislature

in view of the inherent complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements that requires to be

made. [Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill, S.C.S.D. 3/1980].

Prescribed Tax or Levy

In ascertaining profits or income for the purposes of the IR Act, the Appellant is entitled to deduct

all outgoings and expenses. However, section 26 of the IR Act identifies certain non-deductibles

in ascertaining profits or income. The question for determination is whether NBT paid at the time

of importation of goods is not a "prescribed tax or levy" for the purpose of section 26(1)(I)(iii) of

the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Section 2(1) of the Nation Building Tax Act No.9 of 2009 as amended (NBT Act) states that the

provisions of the Act apply to every person who:

(a) imports of any article, other than any article comprised in the personal baggage of the

passenger, into Sri Lanka, ["baggage" shall have the same meaning as in section 107A

of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235)]; or

(b) carries on the business of manufacture of any article; or

(c) carries on the business of providing a service of any description: or

(d) carries on the business of wholesale or retail sale of any article other than such sale

by the manufacturer of that article being a manufacturer to whom the provisions of

paragraph (b) applies.

The Appellant is an importer of vehicles and therefore pays NBT on its imports. In ascertaining its

profits or income the Appellant deducted the NBT paid by it whereas the assessor and the

Respondent took the position that it was not possible to do so and rejected the return and issued

a new assessment. In appeal the Respondent and the TAC concurred with this conclusion of the

assessor. It is in this context that question no. 2 was referred to this Court by the TAe.

NBT is not specifically identified in section 26 of the IR Act as a non-deductible. In the absence of

any other provision, the Appellant is then entitled to deduct the NBT paid by it at the time of

importation. However, section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IR Act states that for the purposes of

ascertaining the profits or income of any person from any sources no deduction shall be allowed

in respect of "any prescribed tax or levy".

Page 6 of 11

The prohibition in section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IR Act in effect acts as an exemption when a person

is not caught up within it as then the person can deduct all the expenses and outgoings of his

business before calculating the taxable income. Exemption notifications must be interpreted

strictly and, in its entirety, and not in parts [Grasim Industries Ltd. & Anvor v. State of Madhya

Pradesh & Anvor and Gwalior Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board & Ors (1999) 8

SCC 547].

In Zebra Technologies Corporation v. Judy Baar Topinka, as Treasurer of the State of Illinois, and

The Department of Revenue [799 N.E.2d 725 (2003),344 III. App.3d 474,278 III. Dec. 860] the

Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, First Division held:

"We are mindful that taxation is the rule and tax exemption is the exception. Chicago Bar

Ass'n v. Department of Revenue, 163 III.2d 290, 301, 206 III.Dec. 113, 644 N.E.2d 1166

(1994). Here, taxpayer is claiming an exemption from tax on income that would otherwise

be assessed but for the 80/20 rule. Thus, taxpayer has the burden of proving clearly that

it comes within the statutory exemption. United Air Lines, Inc. v. Johnson, 84 III.2d 446,

455-56, 50 III.Dec. 631, 419 N.E.2d 899 (1981). Such exemptions are to be strictly

construed, and doubts concerning the applicability of the exemptions will be resolved in

favor of taxation. United Air Lines, 84111.2d at 455,50 III.Dec. 631, 419 N.E.2d 899."

Regulations made by the Minister under section 212 of the IR Act read with section 26 therein

and published in Gazette Notification No. 1606/31 dated 19.06.2009 (Regulation) reads:

"Two thirds of the Nation Building Tax charged by the Nation Building Tax Act, No.9 of

2009 payable for the period commencing on May 1, 2009 and ending on June 30, 2009,

and for every quarter commencing on or after July 1, 2009, shall for the purposes of sub-

paragraph (iii) of paragraph (I) of sub-section (1) of section 26 of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006 be a prescribed levy".

Hence, a portion of the NBT has been made a prescribed levy for the purposes of section

26(1)(I)(iii) of the IR Act. However, the Appellant contends that it has been made a prescribed

levy only for the persons who pay NBT quarterly whereas the Appellant pays NBT at the point of

importation on each article and therefore is not caught within the prohibition on deduction.

Page 7 of 11

The Respondent on the other hand submits that the prohibition on deduction in terms of section

26(1)(I)(iii) of the IR Act covers all three persons referred to in section 2 of the IR Act including

the Appellant and therefore the Appellant is not entitled to deduct the NBT paid by it on its

imports.

In order to have a better understanding of the competing positions, it is important to examine

certain other provisions in the NBT Act. Section 3(1) of the NBT Act reads:

3. (1) A tax to be called the "Nation Building Tax" (hereinafter referred to as lithe Tax")

shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be charged from every person to whom this Act

applies calculated at the appropriate rate specified in the Second Schedule to this Act, in

the following manner: -

(i) in the case of a person referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of

section 2, who imports any article into Sri Lanka on or after January 1,2009

the tax shall be chargeable in respect of the liable turnover of such person

ariSing from the importation into Sri Lanka of such article; and

(ii) in the case of a person referred to in paragraph (b) (c) or (d) of subsection

(1) of section 2, for every quarter commencing on or after January 1, 2009

(hereinafter referred to as "relevant quarter", the tax shall be chargeable

in respect of the liable turnover of such person for such relevant quarter.

Section 3(1) of the NBT Act deals with two separate and distinct incidents of the taxing regime.

The first part is the charging section by which NBT is charged on every person to whom the Act

applies, namely the persons referred to in section 2 of the NBT Act. The second part deals with

the calculation of the NBT. Accordingly, NBT is calculated at the appropriate rate specified in the

Second Schedule thereto in the case of importers of any article on the liable turnover of such

person ariSing from the importation into Sri Lanka of such article and in the case of a person

referred to in paragraph (b) (c) or (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, the NBT is calculated on the

liable turnover of such person for such relevant quarter.

Page 8 of 11

The Respondent has based its argument on the reference to quarter in the Regulation and

submits that as an importer it does not pay NBT quarterly but only in respect of the liable

turnover of such person arising from the importation into Sri Lanka of such article and as such

the NBT it pays on every import is not a prescribed tax or levy.

I am unable to accede to this submission. The Regulation covers both the charging section as well

as the calculation part referred to above. That is why the Regulation reads" Two thirds of the

Nation Building Tax charged by the Nation Building Tax Act, No.9 of 2009 payable for the period

commencing on May 1, 2009 and ending on June 30, 2009, and for every quarter commencing on

or after July 1, 2009 ... ". If one were to accept the submission of the Appellant it would amount

to excluding part of the Regulation in its interpretation.

Furthermore, as the learned Senior State Counsel correctly submitted if the Minister actually

intended to exclude importers from the application of the Regulation he could easily have done

so by referring to only the categories of enterprises referred to in paragraphs b), c) and d) of

Section 2(1) ofthe NBT Act.

In any event, the Appellant submits that the financial statements of the Appellant are prepared

on an accruals basis and not on a payment basis and accordingly, for income tax purposes as well

this basis is considered to be acceptable. It is submitted that if the Appellant effects any imports

and such imported items remain unsold at the end of the financial year, and are sold in

subsequent financial year, the cost of such imports would get recorded as an expense only in the

subsequent year. Accordingly, the Appellant submitted that if the contention of the Respondent

is accepted such add back would occur in the year in which the NBT was collected at customs

point even though the financial statements itself for such year has not considered such NBT as

part of the costs of the goods sold.

Page 9 of 11

The purpose of accounting is usually to provide information to interested parties relevant to

stewardship, control and decision-making. The requirements of a tax system can be quite

different. In Thor Power Tools Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue [58l Ed. 2d.785 at

802 (1979)] the US Supreme Court stated:

"The primary goal offinancial accounting is to provide useful information to management,

shareholders, creditors, and others properly interested; the major responsibility of the

accountant is to protect these parties from being misled. The primary goal of the income

tax system, in contrast, is the equitable collection of revenue; the major responsibility of

the Internal Revenue Service is to protect the public fisc. Consistently with its goals and

responsibilities, financial accounting has as its foundation the principle of conservatism,

with its corollary that 'possible errors in measurement [should] be in the direction of

understatement rather than overstatement of net income and net assets'. In view of the

Treasury's markedly different goals and responsibilities, understatement of income is not

destined to be its guiding light. Given this diversity, even contrariety of objectives, any

presumptive equivalency between tax and financial accounting would be unacceptable".

Accordingly, I reject the submission of the Appellant that any inconsistency between the financial

accounting practices and taxing provisions must be avoided.

For the reasons aforesaid, Court answers the following questions of law as follows:

(1) Was the assessment no. ITA 12301100040V1 dated 30th November 2012(which is the

subject matter of this appeal) invalid in law by reason of the previous assessment no.

6476576 VO dated 6th May 2011 having been issued in respect of the same year of

assessment 2009/2010? No.

(2) Was the assessment for the year 2009/2010 dated 30th November 2012 issued against

the Appellant in any case time barred in terms of Section 163(5)(a) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) (the "IRA") as applicable to such year of assessment?

No.

Page 10 of 11

(3) In terms of the IRA read together with the provisions of Extraordinary Gazette No.

1606/31 dated 19th June 2009

a. Is Nation Building Tax (NBT) paid at the time of importation of goods a "prescribed

tax or levy" for the purpose of section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IR Act? Yes

b. Is the NBT which is expensed in the financial statements of any person in an year

of assessment in accordance with accepted accounting principles a "prescribed

tax or levy" for the purposes of section 26(1)(I)(iii) of the IRA for a different year

of assessment? Yes

For the reasons aforesaid, this Court confirms the Determination of the TAe.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the TAe.
