JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

I have had the opportunity of reading in draft form, the judgment of His

Lordship Justice A H M D Nawaz. I regret my inability to agree with His

Lordship's conclusions and hence thought it fit to write this judgment.

The Petitioner in this application prays from this Court, following main

relief;

I. a writ of certiorari to quash the determination produced marked P

20,

II. a writ of certiorari to quash the document produced marked P 23

A,

III. a writ of mandamus to compel the Respondent to issue an import

license to the Petitioner as per his application produced marked P 1

4.

On the date of the argument, the learned State Counsel for the

Respondent raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this

case on the basis that the Petitioner has failed to submit originals or duly

\

certified copies of the documents he had relied upon, to obtain the prayed

relief, through this application. It was the submission of the learned State

Counsel for the Respondent that the Petitioner has breached rule 3 (1) (a)

of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

It would be in order to commence examining this issue with the re-

production of Rule 3 (1) (a)l which states as follows:

" ... Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

1 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

5

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitution in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

"

Our Courts have repeatedly held that the compliance of this rule is

mandatory. The Petitioner also did not seek to advance any contrary

argument. His argument was that he has complied with the said

requirement. It is his contention that the handwriting found on the reverse

side of the last page of the brief serves as the required compliance of this

rule. Thus, the question this Court has to primarily answer is whether that

entry can be taken as a compliance of the above rule.

Other than the sole sentence referred to above, appearing on the reverse

side of the last page of the brief (i .e. on the reverse of the document marked

'P 24 F') it is a fact that the Petitioner has not submitted any other form of

certification or any certified copy of any document to this Court annexed to

his application. He has also not tendered to Court any original document with

his application.

6

In countering the objection raised by the learned State Counsel, the

Petitioner takes up the position that the common certification on the back of

the document marked 'P 24 F' certifies all the documents (marked from P 1

to P 24 F) to be true copies. 2 In view of this, the task of this Court becomes

two fold. Firstly, this Court has to decide whether the 'common certification'

is a genuine certification at all. Then this Court has to decide whether such

'common certification' could be considered as a sufficient compliance of the

above rule even if that entry is a genuine one.

t 1 The 'common certification' relied upon by the learned counsel is just a hand

written sentence which states that they are true copies. Although there is

something like a signature, nobody would ever know who actually had placed

that signature. This is because no name, stamp, or date could be seen below

that signature. The first impression that this Court would get when it sees

the said 'common certification' is that some interested party has inserted

that entry in a hurry, taking the advantage of the availability of the record

possibly after the learned State Counsel had taken up the preliminary

objection to the maintainability of this application. This thought is justifiable

because there is no indication as to when that entry was made. The absence

of even such a certification in the other copies of the brief would also

substantiate the above proposition. In these circumstances, this Court

cannot and should not demean itself by coming down to an unacceptable

level to uphold such presumably deceitful practices. Such practices must be

frowned upon by all possible measures. Doors of Courts must be closed for

those who attempt to get undue benefits from engaging in such practices.

Having regard to its nature, its location, its format and the absence of any

sign of authentication, it is the view of this Court that the 'common

certification' relied upon by the Petitioner is not a genuine certification but a

deceitful entry.

Although above conclusion is sufficient to dispose this matter, I will proceed

to deal with the second issue as well.

It is common knowledge that the original case record or its certified copy is

generally before Court, when it exercises its appellate or revisionary

jurisdiction. However, one must be mindful that the writ jurisdiction of this

Court is an original jurisdiction. In other words, this Court is called upon to

totally depend on the material supplied by the parties of such writ

application. Thus, there is an incumbent and sacred duty on the part of the

8

Petitioner in particular, to adduce sufficient admissible and reliable evidence

to prove its case before Court.

According to Rule 3 (1) (a) cited above, it is a 'duly certified copy' of the

document (in the absence of original), material to the application in hand

and not a 'true copy' that the Petitioner is required to submit with his

application. It must be borne in mind that there are two requirements in the

above phrase. The first is that the relevant copy must be certified and the

second is that the said certification must be duly done.

The phrase 'duly certified copy' must mean that the authority responsible for

its issuance must have certified the copy submitted to Court as a copy duly

obtained from the original. It is only then that a Court of Law can rely and

act on such document.

It cannot be difficult for anybody to understand that the Attorney at Law for

the Petitioner3 cannot have any authority to duly certify a set of documents,

which the Petitioner himself states has been issued by his bank.

3 Who is generally expected to make out a case for himself relying on the document he says is a 'true copy'.

"

9

As has been pOinted out by the learned State Counsel, the Petitioner in this

application has claimed that he has fulfilled the requirement of remitting in

foreign currencies, his earnings in overseas, to his bank account. However,

the documents the Petitioner has submitted to this Court are nothing more

than photocopies of some documents. Such copies cannot be adduced as

evidence before any Court of Law. A document that is neither the original

nor a duly certified copy has no evidential value. Therefore, this Court has

to conclude that the Petitioner has adduced no evidence to prove his claim.

It would be relevant at this stage to quote the following paragraph from the

judgment of this Court in the case of Attorney General Vs Ranjith Weera

Wickrema Charles Jayasinghe.4 Having considered the importance and the

underlying reasons for the insistence of strict compliance of the above rule,

this Court in that case stated as follows;

" ..... Moreover, the above rule underlines the importance of the presence of

an authoritative and responsible signatory certifying such copies taking the

responsibility for the authenticity of such documents. Insisting on tendering

to Court, such duly certified copies of relevant proceedings is not without

any valid and logical reasons. Courts make orders relying on such

documents. They may sometimes have serious effects on people. The

persons who may be so affected might sometimes be not limited to parties

of the case only. Drastic repercussions may ensue in case the Court makes

such orders on some set of papers, authenticity of which would subsequently

become questionable. That is one of the reasons as to why tendering of duly

certified copies of the relevant documents to Court has been made

mandatory by the Rules ..... \\

Rule 3 (1) (a)5 further provides that where a petitioner fails to comply with

the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or at the instance

of any party, dismiss such application.

In the case of Shanmugawadivu Vs Kulathilake6 the Supreme court has I held as follows n ....... the new Rules permit an applicant to file documents

\ , i

later, if he has stated his inability in filing the relevant documents along

with his application, and had taken steps to seek the leave of the Court to

furnish such documents. In such circumstances, the only kind of discretion

that could be exercised by Court is to see whether and how much time

could be permitted for the filing of papers in due course .... \\

5 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

2003 (1) 5 L R 216.

\

11 I The Petitioner has made no such statement in his petition. Therefore, this

Court has to conclude that the Petitioner at no stage entertained any idea

of tendering to Court any duly certified copies of relevant documents for

the perusal of Court.

As has been decided in the case of Brown & Co. Ltd. and another Vs. t j Ratnayake, Arbitrator and others? (which is a case where the dismissal of

an application for a Writ by the Court of Appeal on the basis of a failure on

the part of the petitioner in that case to annex to the petition, certified

copies of relevant proceedings with regard to the particular dispute),

the Petitioner in the instant case too is not entitled to proceed to the next

step without compliance with a valid invocation of jurisdiction in the first

place.s

Thus, the resultant position before this Court is that the Petitioner has

adduced no evidence to substantiate his claim. Therefore, this Court has no

legal basis to consider the issuance of writs the Petitioner has prayed in

this application.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to refuse this application. This

application should therefore stand dismissed with a cost of Rs. 250,000/=

payable by the Petitioner to the state. The Registrar of this Court is

directed to take steps to recover from the Petitioner the ordered costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
