M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Gampaha in respect of land action bearing Case No. 33068/L.

The Plaintiff-Appellant had instituted this action seeking a Declaration of

title to the land described in Schedule 1 of the Plaint and to eject the

Defendant-Respondents from the strip of the land encroached by them.

Also, the Plaintiff-Appellant prays for a declaration that she is entitled to

the servitude of having light and into her house and also entitled to use the

road to the North of her land.

The 2nd Defendant along with his deceased father who was the 1st

Defendant prays that due to the issuance of the enjoining order prayed by

the Plaintiff-Appellant, they had been suffered damages and added in their

Plaint claiming in reconvention damages.

3

The learned District Judge of Gampaha pronounced his judgment on 08th

May 1997 dismissing the Plaintiff-Appellants action.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) being

dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned District Judge preferred this

appeal and prayed to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge

on the grounds that the learned District Judge of Gampaha had misdirected

himself on the burden of proof in the said case, the judgment delivered by

the learned District Judge of Gampaha is contrary to the law and against

the weight of the evidence adduced in the case.

The learned District Judge of Gampaha had rejected the Plan prepared by

the Surveyor on a commission taken out by the Appellant on the ground

that the original of the Plan superimposed have not been produced by the

Appellant when the evidence given by the said commissioner, But the said

Plan was filed of record in the case at the time he obtained a tracing from

the same and the learned Judge had failed to give due consideration to the

documents produced by the Appellant.

Further the Appellant stated that the learned District Judge of Gampaha

had held that the Appellant is entitled to the land described in the schedule

to the Plaint which is in extent of 30.5 Perches but had held that the

Appellant failed to prove her title to the strip of land disputed by the

Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents)

which is clearly a portion of the land in the said schedule.

4

It is to be noted that the learned District Judge of Gampaha in his judgment

held that the Respondents cannot claim the encroached land by

prescription but he had failed to give judgment in favour of the Appellant.

The Respondents had submitted that they are entitled to claim the

encroached strip of land under prescription the facts that germane to the

issue are whether the Respondents had prescribed the land in terms of

Section 3 of Prescription Ordinance.

According to the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No.

02 of 1889, the claimant must prove:

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant

plaintiff and

3. Ten years previous to the bringing of a such action

In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a change in

the nature of the possession and the party claiming prescriptive right

should show an ouster.

In D.R KIRIAMMA VS. J.A. PODIBANDA AND 8 OTHERS [2005 B.L.J. 09] in

order to claim prescriptive title Udalagama J. emphasized that,

onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the

party claiming prescriptive possession. Importantly,

prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a

factum probandum. I am inclined to the view that

5

considerable circumspection is necessary to recognize the

prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of

the party having paper title. It is in fact said that title by

prescription is an illegality made legal due to the other party

not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka

prescriptive title is required to be by title adverse to an

independent to that of a claimant or Plaintiff.

But the evidence led before the learned District Judge of Gampaha had

clearly proved that the encroachment made by the Respondents was for

the period of 1989-1990 but this action filed against the Respondents by

the Appellant in the year of 1990.

This is very clear that the Respondents did not prove any requirement and

cannot claim upon the prescription of the encroached land according to

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, also the view of the learned

District Judge of Gampaha that the Respondents claim by prescription

cannot be ascertained was within the law.

It is observed that the land described in the 1st schedule to the Plaint and

the Plan which had been made by the A. C. S. Gunaratne, Licensed Surveyor

numbered as 3325 dated 14.05.1954 and the lot marked as 09 allotted to

the Appellant which is in extent 30.5 perches and lot marked 08 was

allotted to the Respondents. It is important to note that both parties

admitted before the learned District Judge of Gampaha in regard to the

correctness of the Plan No. 3325 but the photocopy of the Plan had been

submitted to the trial court not the original.

6

It is also to be noted that no party had objected it and relied on the

identical document although the court had not objected the document

even before its judgment on the basis that it was a photocopy and not the

original. But the learned District Judge of Gampaha in his judgment had

misdirected himself and refused to accept the document as evidence.

Secondary evidences such as photocopies of the originals are admissible

under Section 65, 66 of the Evidence Ordinance. In my view, the photocopy

of the Plan No 3325 is admissible and it is a primary identical document to

this issue.

The Court Commissioners Plan No. 4733/L dated 18.04.1991 which is the

superimposition of Plan No 3325 dated 14.05.1945 clearly shows that lot 9

of the Appellant was divided into two parts 9A and 9B. 9A is an extent of

29.5 Perches and 9B is an extent of 1.25 Perches. The above-mentioned 9B

in extent of 1.25 perches and it is the encroached land by the Respondents.

The building Plan to build the Appellants house in the Lot 09 area, had

submitted by her and authorized by the Chairman of Urban Council of

Ragama dated 05.08.1972 and the extension to the same house approved

by the Urban Council on 09.02.1984 exhibits that a distance of 10 feet has

left by the Appellants house to the Western boundary of her land. In

accordance with the above-mentioned building Plans, there was a fence on

her Western boundary ten feet away from her house.

It is observed that the fence on her Western boundary ten feet away from

the Appellants house, the land has encroached and the fence was partially

destroyed by the Respondents.

7

The documents submitted by the Respondents is the Plan No 667 dated

28.10.1992 made by the Surveyor H. L. M. Sheriff in 1972 which was not

the original but only a photocopy of the original and later the photocopy

was certified by the same Surveyor H. L. M. Sheriff and marked as D 14.

Unlike Plan No. 3325 the authenticity of the Plan No. 667 was doubtful and

several objections made in the trial before the learned District Judge of

Gampaha to prove its accuracy.

The Surveyor H. L. M. Sheriff who has made the Plan No. 667 was from

Badulla District and the evidence given by another Surveyor R. M. J.

Ranasinghe stated that the Surveyor H. L. M. Sheriff had not worked in the

Western province.

Considering the evidence of the son of the Surveyor H. L. M. Sheriff that

the field notes of his father which relates to the Plan No. 667 were not

available to prove the accuracy of the above said Plan.

I am of the view that according to the Survey Plan No. 3325 dated

14.05.1954, the Court Commissioners Plan No. 4733/L dated 18.04.1991

and the building Plans of the Appellant authorized by the Chairman of

Urban Council of Ragama shows that the encroached strip of the land

disputed belongs to the Appellant.

Therefore, I am of the firm view that the Respondents failed to prove any

of the requirements under Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order

to claim prescription to the above-mentioned strip of the land disputed.

8

For the foregoing reasons, I allow the appeal with costs and set aside the

judgment of the learned District Judge of Gampaha pronounced on 08th

May 1997 and I further hold that the Appellant is entitled to the strip of

land encroached by the Respondents and the Respondents to vacate the

above mentioned encroached strip of the land.

Appeal allowed.
