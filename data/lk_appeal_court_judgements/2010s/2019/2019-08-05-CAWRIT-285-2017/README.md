Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner was the Minister of Fisheries, Transport, Trade

and Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and

Motor Traffic of the Northern Province. He and the 6th

Respondent were admittedly removed from their Ministerial

Portfolios by the 1st Respondent Chief Minister of the Northern

Province1, and thereafter the 4th and 5th Respondents were

appointed instead as new Ministers by the 7th Respondent

Governor of the Northern Province2.

The Petitioner filed this application in this Court seeking to

quash by way of writ of certiorari the decision of the 1st

Respondent to remove him as a Minister and the decision of the

7th Respondent to appoint the 4th and 5th Respondents as new

Ministers.

Accordingly, the Petitioner prays inter alia the following

substantive reliefs in the prayer to the petition.

(i) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing P12 (by which the Petitioner was removed by

the 1st Respondent from his Ministerial Portfolios)

(j) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

suspending P13 (Gazette) to the extent that the

portfolios of Fisheries, Transport, Trade and

Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and

1 Vide paragraphs 5 and 7 of the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent dated 06.10.2018, and P12. 2 Vide 1R1, 1R2 and 1R7 tendered with the said statement of objections of the 1st Respondent. 1R7 Gazette has also been marked by the Petitioner as P13.

Motor Traffic have been allocated to persons other than

the Petitioner

(k) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the decision contained in P13 to appoint the

4th and 5th Respondents to the Board of Ministers of

the Northern Province

(l) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the appointment of the 1st Respondent as

Minister in charge of the subjects of Transport, Rural

Development, Road Development and Motor Traffic

(m) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the appointment of the 3rd Respondent as

Minister in charge of the subjects of Trade and

Commerce

(n) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the appointment of the 5th Respondent as

Minister in charge of the subject of Fisheries

The short point to be decided in this case is whether the 1st

Respondent Chief Minister had the authority to remove a

Minister. If he did not, the appointments of new Ministers by

the 7th Respondent Governor allegedly in place of the vacant

portfolios become automatically null and void.

In the Privy Council case of Macfoy v. United Africa Company

Limited3, Lord Denning stated:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only

bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the

3 [1961] 3 All ER 1169 at 1172

5

court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void

without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to

have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You

cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

Such new appointments would also violate the Constitutional

ceiling to have maxim of five Ministers including the Chief

Minister in the Board of Ministers in a Provincial Council.4

On what basis does the 1st Respondent state that he has the

power to remove the Ministers? According to the 1st

Respondent, that is on the basis of Article 154F(5) of the

Constitution read with section 14(f) of the Interpretation

Ordinance.5

Section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance states that the

person who has the power to appoint any officer shall have the

power to remove him.

Article 154F(5) of the Constitution reads as follows:

The Governor shall, on the advice of the Chief Minister,

appoint from among the members of the Provincial Council

constituted for that Province, the other Ministers.

There cannot be a scintilla of doubt that, in terms of Article

154F(5) of the Constitution, it is the Governor who has the

4 Vide Article 154F(1) of the Constitution. 5 Vide P14. Also see paragraph 25 of the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent.

6

power to appoint Ministers, of course, on the advice of the Chief

Minister.

I am firmly of the view that there is no room for a different

interpretation.

This has in fact been acknowledged by the 1st Respondent by

tendering inter alia 1R1, 1R2 and 1R7. This started with the 1st

Respondents letter to the 7th Respondent marked X.6 By that

letter marked X dated 22.08.2017, the 1st Respondent has

requested the 7th Respondent to kindly appoint the new

Ministers. Then the 7th Respondent by 1R1 and 1R2 dated

23.08.2017 has appointed the 4th and 5th Respondents as new

Ministers. Those two Appointment Letters declare that I,

Reginold Cooray, Governor of the Northern Province, by virtue of

the powers vested in me in terms of Article 154F(5) of the

Constitution of democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, do

hereby appoint the 4th and 5th Respondents as new Ministers.

Thereafter those new appointments have been gazetted by the

7th Respondent in the Gazette dated 24.08.2017 marked 1R7.

The heading of 1R7 is Appointments made by the Governor of

Northern Province. Then it says, I, Reginold Cooray, Governor of

the Northern Province, by virtue of the powers vested in me in

terms of Article 154F(1), (4) and (5) of the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, do

hereby announce that I have made the following appointments.

Having thus made use of those documents to bolster up his

case, the 1st Respondent in the same breath cannot now say 6 This was tendered by the Attorney-at-Law of the 7th Respondent with the motion dated 23.07.2018.

7

that he appoints the Ministers (probably in order to artificially

create a situation for a Constitutional interpretation).

A party to a judicial proceeding cannot take up inconsistent

positions to suit the occasion. A party cannot blow hot and

cold, affirm and disaffirm and approbate and reprobate

simultaneously. Quod approbo non reproboOne cannot take

the benefit of an instrument, and at the same time repudiate it.7

If the appointing authority is the Governor, the Chief Minister

cannot, by any stretch of imagination, claim to have the power

to remove the Ministers. The Constitution does not give any

such power of removal to the Chief Minister.

Hence I cannot accept the argument of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 1st Respondent that the power of removal, as a

matter of law and common sense, must necessarily vest with the

Chief Minister.8 Nor can I accept the argument that the

Governor indirectly removed the Petitioner and the 6th

Respondent by appointing new Ministers.9

It is true that Constitution does not expressly provide for

removal of Provincial Ministers. However, in this case, the

question to be decided is not who can remove the Ministers or

who can appoint the Ministers, but whether the Chief Minister

has the power to remove the Ministers. The answer to that

question, in my view, is emphatically in the negative.

7 Ceylon Plywoods Corporation v. Samastha Lanka G.N.S.M Rajya Sanstha Sevaka Sangamaya [1992] 1 Sri LR 157 at 163 8 Paragraph 15 of the written submission of the 1st Respondent dated 01.02.2019. 9 Vide paragraph 33 of the said written submission.

8

The main, if not sole, point urged by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 1st Respondent during the course of his entire

submission before us was to refer this matter to the Supreme

Court under Article 125 of the Constitution for a Constitutional

interpretation.

Article 125(1) of the Constitution reads thus:

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive

jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to

the interpretation of the Constitution, and accordingly,

whenever any such question arises in the course of any

proceedings in any other court or tribunal or other

institution empowered by law to administer justice or to

exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, such question

shall forthwith be referred to the Supreme Court for

determination. The Supreme Court may direct that further

proceedings be stayed pending the determination of such

question.

When there is no ambiguity that there is no power for the Chief

Minister to remove Ministers appointed by the Governor, there is

no necessity to such a course of action being followed. Lex nil

facit frustra, nil jubet frustraThe law does nothing in vain,

commands nothing in vain.

This Court shall refer a matter or a question to the Supreme

Court for a Constitutional interpretation only if there is a real

need for such a referral and not otherwise. The Court cannot be

a party to prolong litigation, which is costly and time-

consuming.

In Billimoria v. Minister of Lands and Land Development &

Mahaweli Development10 Chief Justice Samarakoon observed:

Article 125 of the Constitution requires any dispute on the

interpretation of the Constitution to be referred to this Court.

What is contemplated in Article 125 is "any question

relating to the interpretation of the Constitution" arising in

the course of legal proceedings. This presupposes that in

the determination of a real issue or controversy between the

parties, in any adversary proceedings between them, there

must arise the need for an interpretation of the provisions of

the Constitution. The mere reliance on a constitutional

provision by a party need not necessarily involve the

question of the interpretation of the Constitution. There

must be a dispute on interpretation between contending

parties. It would appear that Article 125 is so circumscribed

that it must be construed as dealing only with cases where

the interpretation of the Constitution is drawn into the

actual dispute and such question is raised directly as an

issue between the parties or impinges on an issue and

forms part of the case of one party, opposed by the other,

and which the Court must of necessity decide in resolving

that issue.

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the removal of the

Petitioner from his Ministerial Portfolios of the Northern

Provincial Council by the 1st Respondent Chief Minister is clearly

ultra vires and made without jurisdiction and therefore is a

nullity. The Chief Minister had no power to remove the

10 [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 10 at 15-16

10

Petitioner from his Ministerial Portfolios. On that premise, the

appointments of the 4th and 5th Respondents as new Ministers

by the Governor are also null and void ab initio. I quash the said

decisions of removal and new appointments by way of writ of

certiorari.

The reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (i)-(n) of the prayer to the

petition, which I quoted above, are granted.

Application is allowed with costs payable by the 1st Respondent

to the Petitioner.
