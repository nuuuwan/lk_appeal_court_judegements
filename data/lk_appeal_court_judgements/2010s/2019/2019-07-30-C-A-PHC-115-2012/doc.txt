Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner-respondent (respondent) filed an application against

the respondent-appellant (appellant) under section 66(1)(b) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Magistrates Court seeking to

restore him in possession in terms of section 68(3) on the basis

that he was dispossessed from the land in question by the

appellant immediately within two months before the filing of the

application.

As seen from the Journal Entry dated 25.02.2010, the learned

Magistrate first having satisfied that there would be an imminent

threat to the breach of the peace as a result of this land dispute,

issued notice on the respondent.

However, after the inquiry concluded by way of written

submissions, the learned Magistrate by order dated 08.07.2010

dismissed the application of the petitioner, without making a

determination on possession, stating that the Court has no

jurisdiction to make an order on possession as there was no

breach of the peace.

On appeal, the learned High Court Judge set aside that order on

the ground that once the Magistrate was satisfied that there was

an imminent threat to the breach of the peace, he cannot at the

end dismiss the application on want of jurisdiction on the premise

that there was no threat to the breach of the peace. The learned

High Court Judge directed the learned Magistrate to deliver the

order afresh on merits.

It is against this Judgement of the High Court the appellant has

filed this appeal.

It is my considered view that the Judgment of the High Court is

correct. The Magistrate is clothed with the jurisdiction to entertain

the application upon his being satisfied that owing to the dispute

affecting land, the breach of the peace is threatened or likely. That

is a precondition to issuance of notice. Once it is recorded and

notice issued, and the inquiry is held, the Magistrate need not

revisit his earlier decision and dismiss the application in limine

without considering the merits on the ground of lack of jurisdiction

due to non-existence of breach of the peace.

Breach of the peace does not amount to actual physical fight

leading to grievous hurt or murder. If the breach of the peace is

likely, although there is no such threat at present, that is sufficient

for the Magistrate to make an order under section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
