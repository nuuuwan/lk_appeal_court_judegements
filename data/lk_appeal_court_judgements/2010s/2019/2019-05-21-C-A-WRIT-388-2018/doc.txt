The Petitioner states that she is a citizen of Sri Lanka and makes this

application in the public interest. In this application the Petitioner complains that

the 1 st Respondent, (Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe), as at the time of the

parliamentary elections held on 17/08/2015, held a financial interest in several

contracts entered into with his family company "Lake House Printers and

Publishers PLC", by the public corporations, referred to below, on behalf of the

Republic of Sri Lanka, while holding the office of Prime Minister of the Republic

within the Cabinet of Ministers. In the said circumstances, the Petitioner states that

the 1 st Respondent is guilty of having an interest in such contracts entered into

with state institutions or public corporations as contemplated by Article 91 (1)( e)

of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 1978, and,

therefore, the Petitioner is entitled to a mandate in the nature of a writ of Quo

Warranto requiring the 1st Respondent to show by what authority he claims to hold

4

office as a Member of Parliament. Article 91 (1 )( e) of the Constitution provides as

follows -

"(91)1 No person shall be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to

sit and vote in parliament - .

(e) if he has any such interest in any such contract made by or on behalf of the

State or public corporation as Parliament shall by law prescribe"

In paragraph 13, sub paragraphs, a. to i. of the Petition, while describing the

1 st Respondent as a major shareholder of Lake House Printers and Publishers PLC,

the Petitioner makes reference to, two public corporations, Bank of Ceylon and

People's Bank, (4th and the 5th Respondents), owned by the Republic of Sri Lanka,

alleged to have been awarded contracts to obtain services, including the printing of

cheque books, embossing and engraving of consumer debit and credit cards and

employee identity cards, by the said company.

The Petitioner contends that the Annual Report for the years 2014, 2015,

2016, 2017 and 2018, describe the 1 st Respondent as the 9th largest shareholder of

the sai~ company, holding 38,964 shares of the company. The Petitioner in

,

support of such contention has annexed parts of the Annual Report from 2014 to

2018 of the said company marked, P6 (a) to P6 ( e), and the relevant pages where

the list of major shareholders appear marked, P7 (a) to P7 (e), and claims that the

said electronically published documents can be accessed from the Colombo Stock

Exchange official website.

In response to Paragraph 13 of the Petition, the 1 st and 2nd Respondents in

their written submissions filed of record submit that "the claim that the r t

Respondent is a major shareholder of Lake House Printers and Publishers PLe,

lies at the core of the Petitioner's case, as the Petitioner claims that the 1st

Respondent by virtue of holding such shares and by entering into a (undisclosed)

contract with the government, is disqualified from office ".

When this application came up for support on 12/02/2019, prior to the

application for notice, counsel for the 1 s\ 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents raised

preliminary objections to the maintainability of the Petition.

Preliminary objections raised on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, inter

alia, are that;

l. The Petitioner had failed to comply with Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the "Court of

Appeal Rules") inasmuch as;

1. Several material documents relied on by the Petitioner have not been duly

certified, and not even been duly certified as a true copy by an Attorney at

Law.

11. Documents material to the Petitioner (material documents) have not been

furnished (even copies of the relevant contracts).

2. Necessary parties to this application have not been named as Respondents.

6

3. No final relief has been sought against the 4th and 5th Respondents, and as such

no interim relief can be sought against them.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General associated himself with the aforesaid

preliminary objections and, in addition, raised the following Preliminary

objections on behalf of the 4th Respondent;

1. The application of the Petitioner in respect of prayers (b) and (c) to the Petition

is misconceived in law.

2. In the absence of necessary parties, the Petitioner cannot proceed with this

application.

3. The Petitioner has failed to exhaust alternate remedies.

The first preliminary objection on behalf of the 1 st and 2nd Respondents is

based on the non-compliance of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules, and

thus the failure of the Petitioner to validly invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court

and seeks that this application be dismissed in limine.

Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules states that;

"Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers

vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by

way of petition, together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and

shall be accompanied by the originals of documents material to such application

(or duly certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is

unable to tender any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability

7

and seek the leave of the court to furnish such documents later. Where a Petitioner

fails to comply with the provisions of this rule, the court may, ex meromotu or at

the insistence of any party, dismiss such application. "

In support of his contention,. the learned President's Counsel for the 1 st

Respondent has referred to the judgment of Shiranee Bandaranayake J. (as she

then was) in Shanmugavadivu V. Kulathilake (2003) 1 SLR 215, where she held

that;

"The requirements of Rules 3 (l)(a) ... ... are imperative ", and gone on to

state "that there were only very limited circumstances in which the non-

compliance with the said rule would not lead to the dismissal of the case. "

The learned President's Counsel submits that, when the Petitioner has not

complied with the rule, but has stated the reason for the inability to submit the

necessary documents, and sought the leave of Court to furnish the said documents,

the Court, in limited circumstances, could permit such application.

In response, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner contends

that, the documents marked P6a to P6e and P7a to P7e are electronically

accessible public documents published by the Colombo Stock Exchange in its

official website, which are acceptable and admissible in terms of Section 5(1 )( c)

of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, and therefore compliant

with the said Rule.

8

Without prejudice to the above stand, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

further contends that non-compliance with rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal

Rules, does not ensure automatic mandatory dismissal, since the said Rule by the

following words, "Where a Petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this

rule the Court may, ex meromotu or at the instance of any party dismiss such

application" has given a liberal interpretation to the said Rule by providing the

Court with a discretion not to dismiss the Petition in the case of non-compliance.

The said argument is based on the construction of the Court of Appeal Rules, as

providing a discretion to Court to uphold an objection as opposed to Rule 46 of the

Supreme Court Rules 1978, where such discretion was not provided.

The Petitioner submits that, following the decision in Kiriwanthe and

another V. Nawaratne and Another (1990) 2 SLR 393, the newly Gazetted Court

of Appeal Rules, which came into effect, shortly thereafter, expressly provided

that "where a Petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he shall state the

reason for such inability and seek leave of the Court to furnish such documents

later ".

It is to be noted that the decision In Kiriwante and Another V. Nawaratne

and Another (Supra) has considered the effect of non-compliance of the Supreme

Court Rules of 1978 and not the Court of Appeal Rules of 1990. With regard to

the adoption of Rules 3(1)(a) and 3(1)(b) of the Court of Appeal Rules, the

Supreme Court, in Shanmugavadivu Vs. Kulathilake (Supra), held that

9

"the new Rules indicate that the objectivity of exercising judicial discretion, as

intended in Kiriwanthe's case has been incorporated as it enables an applicant to

submit to Court the relevant documents at a later stage". It further held that;

"the new Rules permit an applicant to file documents later, if he has stated his

inability in filing the relevant documents along with his application, and had taken

steps to seek the leave of the Court to furnish such documents".

In Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie and 2 others Vs. Vehicles Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. S.c.

(sp/.) L.A. Application No. 28612007, Shiranee Bandaranayake J. (as she then

was) cited with approval the case of Samantha Niroshana Vs. Sen erath

Abeyruwan (S.c. Sp!.) L.A. 14512006 - S.c. Minutes of 0210812007, where Her

Ladyship observed;

"that in certain instances, taking into consideration the surrounding

circumstances, the Court could exercise its discretion either to excuse its non-

compliance or to impose a sanction. Notwithstanding the above position, it is to be

borne in mind that in the decision of Kiriwante Vs. Nawaratne (supra) this Court

has not suggested automatic exercise of its discretion to excuse the non-

, compliance of Supreme Court Rules. "

By motion dated 22/02/2019, the Petitioner has reserved her right to tender

any further evidence or affidavits and documents as necessary, substantiating the

averments in her Petition and accordingly has submitted documents marked P9 to

P 18, and has moved that the Court accept same. The said documents alleged to be

10

material to this application are not supported by an affidavit and the reasons for

inability to tender such documents at the time of filing the application, are not

stated.

According to paragraph 28 of the written submissions, the Petitioner makes

reference to documents marked P 14 to P 18 and submits that they are new

documents, which corroborate, support and substantiate the facts contained in the

documents marked P6a to P7 e. In the circumstances, the alleged default alluded to

by the Respondents, that the material documents relied on by the Petitioner have

not been duly certified nor been duly certified as true copies by an Attorney-at-

Law, in respect of documents marked P6a to P7e, in compliance of Rule 3(1)(a), is

unexplained.

The stand taken by the Petitioner, in respect of documents marked P6a to

P7e, is that the said documents are electronically accessible public documents,

which do not require further proof in terms of Section 5(1)(a ) of the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 and, therefore, are complaint with Rule

3(1)(a) of the Appellate Procedure Rules.

, The object of Rule 3(l)(a) is, that an affidavit filed in support of the

averments to the Petition, shall be accompanied by the original documents

material to such application or duly certified copies, thereof. The Petitioner has

filed additional documents by motion dated 22/0112019; however, reasons for the

inability to tender such documents with the Petition are not explained. It is noted

11

that by the said motion, the Petitioner has failed to purge his default by providing

the originals or certified copies of the specified documents annexed to the Petition.

It is also noted that several of the documents (including the said documents

marked P6(a) to P6(e) and P7(a) to P7(e), which are submitted with the Petition,

bear the impression of a rubber stamp of an Attorney-at-Law, but there is no

indication why it has been placed on the documents or any signature relating to its

use.

In the circumstances, leading to this application, it is observed that the

documents marked P6a to P7 e, annexed in support of averment 13 of the Petition,

are material documents for the determination of this application.

The learned President's Counsel for the 15t Respondent has cited Brown &

Co. Ltd. and Another V. Ratnayake (1994) 3 SLR 91 at 99-100, where the Court

held that;

"the burden of presenting a proper application is on the party that seeks the

intervention of the Court. The procedure is specified for this threshold stage. The

Rule regulates the mode of enforcing a legal right. The Petitioner has to tender all

. relevant material to the Court in order to invoke its jurisdiction. If he fails to do

this, there is failure to comply with a substantial aspect of the Rule ".

The Court of Appeal Rules make provision, under Rule 3(1)(a), for a

Petitioner to tender originals of documents or certified copies thereof, in support

of the averments contained in an application to exercise powers vested in this

12

Court by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution. The documents marked P6(a)-(e)

and P7(a)-(e), attached to the affidavit, are not original documents or certified

copies of original documents. The failure to comply with the said Rule remains

unexplained. The Rule relating to the discretion of Court in consideration of

surrounding circumstances, as noted above, in my view, cannot be outweighed by

considerations which disregard the objective of the Rule. I observe that there is a

clear and consistent non-compliance of the said Rule in the application submitted

to Court. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the procedure for

invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court, the strict compliance of which is

imperative.

For the reasons aforementioned, I uphold the preliminary objection raised

by the Respondents and dismiss the Petitioner's Application for non-compliance

with Rule 3(1)(a), of the Court of Appeal Rules.

Since this determination would decide the application pending before

Court, it is not necessary to deal further with the rest of the preliminary objections

raised by the Respondents.

I make no order as to costs.

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
