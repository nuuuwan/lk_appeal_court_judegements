Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners, daughter and mother respectively,

filed this application seeking to compel the Mahaweli Authority

of Sri Lanka, the Resident Project Manager of Walawa Area, and

Divisional Manager of Angunukolapelessa by writ of mandamus

to issue a Permit or Grant in the name of the 1st Petitioner under

the Land Development Ordinance in respect of the paddy land in

suit. The 1st Respondent heavily relies on the document marked

P9 issued by the Divisional Manager of Angunukolapelessa at a

Provincial Day to regularize the possession of the land in her

favour.

The 4th Respondent who is a sister of the 1st Respondents

deceased father is another contender to get a Permit issued in

her name from the Mahaweli Authority. She tenders inter alia

the document marked 4R3 issued by the Resident Project

Manager of Walawa Area and ratified even by the Director

General of the Mahaweli Authority to say that the Mahaweli

Authority has decided to regularize the possession of the land in

favour of the 4th Respondent.

Both parties have possessed the land at different times and now

none cultivates the land as it is now in the possession of the

Mahaweli Authority may be to prevent breach of the peace.

This Court cannot compel the Mahaweli Authority to issue the

Permit in favour of the 1st Petitioner. That decision shall be

taken by the Mahaweli Authority after a due inquiry according to

law.

The Mahaweli Authority with its objections has inter alia

tendered a copy of the letter marked 1R13 dated 22.06.2016,

3

which has been sent both to the 1st Petitioner and the 4th

Respondent to attend for an inquiry on 29.06.2016 on the

question of issuance of a Permit in respect of this land. In the

meantime, this case has been filed on 20.06.2016.

The alternative relief sought for by the 1st Petitioner by

paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition is to compel the 1st-3rd

Respondents by mandamus to hold an inquiry to issue a Permit

or Grant under the Land Development Ordinance.

Already the 2nd Respondent by 1R13 taken steps to hold an

inquiry, and it appears that the said inquiry could not be held

due to this case.

There is no necessity for this Court to make that order sought

under paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition. However I

formally make that order and grant the relief as prayed for in

paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition. In that inquiry, both

the 1st Petitioner and the 4th Respondent shall be heard.

Application is partly allowed. No costs.
