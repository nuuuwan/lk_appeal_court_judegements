Decided on: 05.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner company filed this application seeking to quash

by way of writ of certiorari Notices/Orders marked P8 and P9B

issued by the Commissioner of Labour directing the petitioner to

pay a sum of Rs. 9,931,823.39 as Employment Provident Fund

contribution and a sum Rs. 1,686,360/= as Gratuity due to the

5th respondent employee; and to prohibit the Commissioner of

Labour by way of writ of prohibition from enforcing the said

Notices/Orders.

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner is that the 5th respondent was hired by the petitioner

company as an independent contractor in the capacity of a

technical consultant on account of her expertise in the apparel

production process and not as an employee of the company, and

therefore the 5th respondent is not entitled to EPF and Gratuity.

There is no dispute that a person who is an independent

contractor falls outside the category of employee/workman.

How to differentiate an independent contractor from an

3

employee has been the subject of many a judicial

pronouncement both here and abroad. So much has been

written on this topic by distinguished authors.

One thing is clear. That is, whether or not a person is an

independent contractor or an employee is a question of fact,

which shall be decided on the unique facts and circumstances of

each individual case.

To decide that vexed question, various tests are used. However,

for the present purposes, the matter can be decided on the

formula suggested by the petitioner himself using the

petitioners own documents.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner explains how an

employee can be distinguished from an independent contractor

in the following manner:

An employee acts in accordance with the directions of the

employer and as such does not possess individual

autonomy to decide the manner in which work should be

carried out. Thus, it is stated in law as creating a Master

Servant relationship whereby the employee will be subject

to the control of his/her employer.1

The independent contractors, on the other hand, according to

the learned Presidents Counsel, are not subjected to such a

control by the employer.

1 Vide paragraph 9 of the written submission of the petitioner dated 30.10.2018.

4

Then it is clear that the overriding principle in this assessment

is the right of the employer to control the employee. This is one

of the tests, in fact, the traditional test, which is known as

Control Test.

The learned Presidents Counsel has cited only one case to

convince that the 5th respondent, who, according to the learned

Counsel, was hired in the capacity of a technical consultant due

to her specialized knowledge and skill would fall under the

purview of an independent contractor. That is a Judgment of

this Court by Goonaratne J. in Bartleet Produce Marketing (Pvt)

Limited v. V.B.P.K. Weerasinghe (CA (Writ) 344/2011). A copy of

that unreported Judgment has not been tendered with the

written submissions, but I traced a copy with difficulty.

It was a case where the 3rd respondent employee worked as a

consultant in the employer company. The Commissioner of

Labour after inquiry decided that he was an employee and not

an independent contractor. This decision was quashed by way

of certiorari by this Court. In the unique facts and

circumstances of that case, that conclusion is correct. It is

amply clear by the following piece of evidence quoted by

Goonaratne J. in the Judgment:

The consultant in that case, had no fixed time to report for work.

He did not sign the attendance register when reporting for work

and leaving work. There was no standard procedure to take

leave of work. Whilst working as a consultant in the petitioner

company, he had been providing services as a consultant to

others too. There was no Agreement signed between the

company and himself in relation to the employment.

However, the facts are totally different in this case. From the

documents tendered by the petitioner, it is clear that the 5th

respondent is an employee and not an independent contractor. I

will now refer to a few of them.

6

1. According to P3(b) issued by the petitioner company the

5th respondent, a female Pilipino national living here

under Visa has joined the petitioner company on

22.01.2007 and left the company on 14.05.2015 after

working in the company as Consultant Technical for 8

years and 3 months. P3(b) particularly says her basic

salary is USD 2,679.00. This is not a consultancy fee

paid depending on work.

This goes to show that the 5th respondent has worked in

the company for a continuous period of 8 years and 3

months for a fixed monthly salary.

The fact that the petitioner worked in the capacity of

Technical Consultant from 22.01.2007-14.05.2015 has

been admitted by the petitioner company in paragraph

2(d) of the statement of objections filed at the inquiry

before the Labour Commissioner marked P4 as well.

2. According to paragraph 2(a) of P4, The Complainant is a

Pilipino national and was solicited and hired by the

Respondent when the Complainant was resident/

domiciled in the Philippines.

That means, the petitioner company has got her down to

Sri Lanka when she was in Philippines to work in the

petitioner company in Sri Lanka. During that period,

according to paragraph 2(e) and (f) of P4, the petitioner

company has processed her Visa/Work Permit to stay in

Sri Lanka. She has worked fulltime under the petitioner.

7

3. P3(c)-P3(k) are Consultancy Agreements signed between

the petitioner and the 5th respondent.2

In those Agreements it is stated that The consultant (the

5th respondent) will be required to attend all technical

consultation related to Product Development Department.

(Detail attached with Job Description).

That means the 5th respondent has been given a specific

task to perform, and that is described in detail in the

attached document to the Agreement. However, the said

Job Description has not been tendered to Court by the

petitioner company. When such specific task is given,

there shall necessarily be a supervision to see whether she

performs that task to the satisfaction of the employer.

4. Another condition of the said Agreements is The

consultancy hours of the consultant will be from 7.30 am to

5.45 pm from Monday to Friday or as agreed by the two

parties.

That means, there is a specific time on which she shall

report for work and a specific time for her to off for the

day, and was under direct control and supervision by the

petitioner employer.

The clause in the Agreements that Nothing in this

Agreement shall be construed to create an employment

relationship between the parties to this Agreement is not

decisive. Whether or not employer-employee relationship

2 The belated argument that except three of those Agreements, other Agreements are with another company is not acceptable, and I will deal with it separately.

8

is formed, shall be decided not by the label but by

circumstances in each individual case.

I would further add that, inclusion of such a clause in

Agreements goes to suggest that the employer well in

advance has taken precautionary steps to deny employer-

employee relationship whereas it is a matter to be decided

on facts at the end of the relationship. That, in my view,

shows the mala fides of the employer.

5. Document marked P3(l) cuts across the petitioners

argument. It is a document issued by the petitioner to the

HSBC Bank to say that the 5th respondent is an employee

of our organization. She is employed as a Technical

Consultant and her monthly salary is as follows; Basic

Salary-USD 2,820.00.

The petitioners position is that it was issued to help the

5th respondent to obtain a loan from the said Bank.

Whatever may be the reason, it reflects the true nature of

the relationship between the two parties. Full time

Technical Consultant with a fixed salary is an employee of

the company.

6. The email correspondence marked compendiously P6(b)

shows that the 5th respondent is an integral part of the

companys team and her work has integrated into the

business of the petitioner company. P6(b) shows how her

services had been appreciated and acknowledged by the

employer.

7. P6(d) shows that the company has got the Heath

Insurance for the 5th respondent through Ceylinco Health

Insurance Scheme. If the 5th respondent was an

9

independent contractor, there was no such necessity to

look after her health.

8. By P6(a) the 5th respondent has inter alia stated that

instead of physically signing the attendance register, she

was asked to place her finger print on a finger print

machine. This has been admitted by the petitioner in

paragraph 7(d) of P7. That means, her working hours

have been closely monitored without leaving any room to

cheat the employer.

If the working hours of the 5th respondent was closely

monitored in that manner, the denial of the petitioner

employer that there was no control over her taking leave of

work by the company is plainly unacceptable.

9. Further, the petitioner in paragraph 7(b) of the further

written submissions tendered to the Labour Commissioner

marked P7 has stated as follows:

The Complainant was expected to render consultancy

services between 7.30 am to 5.45 pm to the Company at its

various plants and factories as directed by the Respondent

from time to time and did not report to any specified or

regular place of work as akin to employment.

This goes to show how she was controlled by the employer

by giving directions. This further goes to show that, even

in instances where she had to go to various other plants

and factories of the petitioner company, she had to work

during specified working hours, i.e. between 7.30 am-5.45

pm. No concession regarding working hours has been

given in any circumstances.

10

Taking the above matters into account, it is clear that the

petitioner company has had a heavy control over the 5th

respondent in the discharge of her duties as a Consultant in the

petitioner company. There is no law that people who are

recruited as Consultants or discharging duties as Consultants

shall necessarily fall within the category of independent

contractors. It is my considered view that the decision of the

Commissioner of Labour in P9A that there was an employer-

employee relationship between the petitioner and the 5th

respondent is flawless.

Hence the petitioners main argument fails.

The next argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner relates to the name change of the company in some

documents. The name of the petitioner company in the petition

is Courtaulds Trading Company (Pvt) Limited. P9(b) Order is in

that name. However, P9(a) Notice, P3(f)-(k) Consultancy

Agreements are in the name of Courtaulds Clothing Lanka (Pvt)

Ltd and Courtaulds Clothing Dambadeniya (Pvt) Ltd. The

petitioner is now trying to say that those Agreements are not

with the petitioner company. This is a belated defence not taken

up at the inquiry before the Labour Commissioner. The 5th

respondent tendered those Agreements to the Labour

Commissioner in support of her application. In response to

those Agreements, the petitioner in paragraph 2(b) of the

statement of objections marked P4 stated as follows:

At all times material, the Complainant (the 5th respondent)

was engaged in the capacity of a Consultant/Technical

11

Consultant under Consultancy Agreements entered into

between the Complainant and the Respondent (the

Petitioner), copies of which have been produced by the

Complainant with the complaint.

The petitioner has thereby clearly admitted that all the aforesaid

Agreements were entered into between the petitioner and the 5th

respondent even though the company name is changed in some

of those documents. I reject that argument.

Another argument mounted by the learned Presidents Counsel

is that, after this inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour

there was another inquiry, and therefore P8, P9(a) and P9(b) are

invalid. It appears that whilst the case was pending further

attempt has been made to see whether an amicable settlement is

possible. However the petitioner has not participated in that

inquiry and at last the earlier decision has not been changed. I

reject that argument too.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs which I fix

at Rs.100,000/= payable by the petitioner to the 5th respondent

employee.
