JUDGMENT ON

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

10.09.2018 and 25.04.2019-by the 2nd Defendant Appellant

25.03.2019 -by the Substituted Plaintiff Respondent

01. The Plaintiff Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted the above styled action in the

District Court Gampaha, (later it was heard in District Court Pugoda)

seeking a declaration of title and ejectInent of the 1 st Defendant. Later the 2nd

Defendant Appellant (Appellant) intervened. 1 st and 2nd Defendants in their

answers prayed for dismissal of the plaint. After trial the learned District

Judge answered the issues in favour of the Plaintiff and ordered that the

Plaintiff be restored in possession of the land in question.

02. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant appealed against the

said judgment to this court. In his petition of appeal, he said that the learned

District Judge did not consider the deeds submitted by the Appellant. Further

it is sublnitted that the boundaries mentioned by the Plaintiff are different to

the boundaries mentioned in the submitted plan no. 3181 and that fact was

not considered by the learned Trial Judge.

03. We considered the pleadings and evidence adduced in the District Court,

Judgment of the learned District Judge and submissions made by counsel for

both Appellant and the Respondent.

04. It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that the Plaintiff has

failed to identify the corpus. The learned District Judge in pages 06 and 07

of her judgment has discussed about the issue of identity of the corpus based

on the evidence placed before her. When the surveyor went to survey the

land Plaintiff as well as the 1 5t Defendant has been there and the Plaintiff has

clearly identified the land in question. Accordingly, surveyor had prepared

the plan 3181 dated 20.03.1985, based on the cOlnmission issued to him by

court. According to paragraphs 06 and 07 of the report by the surveyor,

Plaintiff has claimed the said land as his and according to Paragraph 08, 15t

Defendant has claitned the same land as his. On the evidence placed before

her, the learned District Judge has given good and sufficient reasons as to

why she concluded that the issue on the identity of the corpus (issue No 11)

was answered in favour of the Plaintiff.

05. Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that the Appellant has failed to

prove his title to the land. It is settled law that in a declaration of title action,

the burden is on the Plaintiff to establish that he has the title.

06. It is submitted by the counsel for the Respondent that where the Plaintiff

enjoyed prior peaceful possession of the property and alleges that he was

ousted by the Defendant, there is a rebuttable presumption of title in favour

of the Plaintiff. Counsel has brought to the notice of the Court, decided case

law to substantiate his position.

3

07. On the evidence adduced in the District Court, it was clear that the Plaintiff

had been in possession of the land in dispute and that the Appellant had

taken possession by unlawful force. Although the Plaintiff did not produce

any title deeds, as the learned District Judge rightly found that the Plaintiff

had been in possession of the land until he was unlawfully dispossessed in

1978 by the Appellant. It is evident that there had been a case in the Primary

Court on that issue. The learned District Judge has also found for the reasons

given in her judgment, that the schedule in deeds produced by the Appellant

did not tally with the boundaries of plan No. 3181.

08. As subn1itted by the counsel for the Respondent, in case of Mudalihamy V.

Appuhamy [1891J 1 CLR 67, Burnside C.J said;

((The Plaintiffwas in the bonafide possession of the chena in question

and had cleared it for sowing when the Defendant entered upon it

sowed it and put the Plaintiff out. Now Prima facie, the Plaintiff

having been in possession, he was entitled to keep it against all the

world but the rightful owner, and if the Defendant claimed to be the

owner, the burden of proving his title rested on him, and Plaintiff

lnight have contended himself with proving his de facie possession at

the time of the ouster ... "

This principle was also followed In case of Luwis Singho V.

Ponnantperuma [1996J 2 Sri L.R. page 320.

09. As mentioned in paragraph 07 of this judgment it was evident that the

Plaintiff was in possession until he was unlawfully dispossessed by the

Appellant. Also, the Appellant has failed to prove his title as mentioned by

the learned District Judge in her JudgInent. Hence the learned District Judge

4

has come to the correct finding in her judglnent, that this Court has no

reason to interfere. Therefore, we find that this appeal has no merit and

should fail.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
