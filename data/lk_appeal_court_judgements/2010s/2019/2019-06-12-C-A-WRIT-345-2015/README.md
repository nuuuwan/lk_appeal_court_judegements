And 23 Others

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: J.C. Weliamuna, P.C., with Senura

Respondents.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking a mandate in

the nature of writ of mandamus directing the respondents

(University Grants Commission and University Council of the

Eastern University) to immediately appoint the petitioner to the

post of Senior Lecturer Grade II in Philosophy (at the Eastern

University) consequent to the decision contained in the document

marked P12.

To issue a mandamus compelling the respondents to

immediately appoint the petitioner to the post of Senior Lecturer

in Philosophy consequent to the decision contained in P12, the

petitioner must show that he has a legal right, with the

corresponding legal duty on the part of the respondent, for him

to be so appointed to that post, which has unreasonably been

withheld by the latter.1

What is P12 decision, which the petitioner seeks to compel the

respondents to immediately comply with? P12 is a Memo with

the heading Recommendation of the Selection Committee. In

the first place, there is no decision in P12. It is only a mere

recommendation by the Selection Committee (without giving any

reasons whatsoever) to appoint the petitioner (out of 8

applicants including one having a Ph.D) to the said post with

the approval of the University Grants Commission.

The University Grants Commission cannot be compelled to

blindly confirm the Selection Committee recommendation and

appoint the petitioner to the said post immediately. If that is the

case, there is no necessity make a recommendation by the

Selection Committee. The Selection Committee could

straightaway appoint the petitioner to the said post.

The University Grants Commission circulars marked P10A,

P10B and P11 govern the Universities and not University Grants

Commission itself.

The recommendation in P12, as it is stated in that document

itself, is subject to the approval of the University Grants

Commission.

By going through 1R4 and 1R6 it is seen that the University

Grants Commission has not given its approval on three reasons:

(a) The petitioner has been served with vacation of post in

2007 due to non-assumption of duties after study leave

as Senior Lecturer.

(b) The petitioner has not completed the Ph.D for which he

had been granted paid overseas study leave.

(c) The applicant Dr. R. Premakumar is more academically

qualified than the petitioner.

The petitioner has not tendered 1R4 and 1R6 although he has

tendered all the documents including confidential documents

such as Select Committee Memo (P12), Minutes of the University

Council Meetings (P13B Attachment). He in the written

submissions says that those letters have not been copied to him.

Then P9 (which is favourable to him) and those confidential

documents have also not been copied to him although he has

4

tendered to Court with his petition. He has not acted with

uberrima fides.

By P6A and P6B it is clear that upon his request, the petitioner

has been given paid overseas study leave for three years to

pursue Ph.D programme at University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

But he has not completed Ph.D nor reported to the University

after three years or any time thereafter. To my dismay, in

paragraph 8(e) of his counter affidavit he says that he was

unable to complete his studies due to the prevailing political

situation in the country as I had to seek asylum. That means,

he has gone abroad on a Government to Government

Scholarship (SAARC Scholarship) on paid study leave not to

study but to seek asylum. That shows his mala fides.

According to P7, the petitioner has to pay a sum of

Rs.6,452,912/50 to the University (upon his going abroad on

paid leave). The 3rd respondent Vice Chancellor in his statement

of objection has stated that an action is to be filed to recover the

said money from the petitioner.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, no mandamus

compelling the respondents to appoint him as a Senior Lecturer

can be issued against the respondents.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed. The petitioner shall

pay a sum of Rs.50,000/= as costs to the 1st respondent-

University Grants Commission.
