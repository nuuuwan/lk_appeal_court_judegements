The Accused-Petitioners - On 25.10.2018

26.03.2019

The Accused-Petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to set aside the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara dated 26.01.2015 in case

No. HC 41112004. After concluding the argument, the Learned SSC for the AG

informed that no written submissions would be filed on behalf of the respondent

since a comprehensive statement of objections has been already filed.

Facts of the case:

The 1 st accused-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the '1 st petitioner') and the 2nd

accused-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd petitioner') were indicted in

the High Court of Kalutara for committing an offence punishable under section

296 read together with section 32 of the Penal Code. After concluding the case for

prosecution, the 1 st petitioner gave evidence on 26.11.2013 and 02.06.2014. Whilst

Page 2 of 15

the 1 st petitioner was testifying, his CouI\sel who appeared in the High Court

infonned Court that both petitioners were willing to tender a plea of guilt to a , lesser culpability in tenns of section 297 of the penal code.

The indictment was amended to an offence of Culpable Homicide not amounting

to Murder, punishable in tenns of section 297 and it was read out to the petitioners

on 10.12.2014. Accordingly both petitioners pleaded guilty to the amended

indictment. Thereafter the Learned High Court Judge imposed 10 year rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.50, 000/= with a default term of 6 months simple

imprisonment on each petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the petitioner preferred this reVISIon

application.

The petitioners have averred following grounds III the petition as exceptional

circumstances;

1. The order of the Learned High Court Judge imposing a sentence of 10 years

rigorous imprisonment on petitioners is bad in law

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider whether petitioners have

acted on cumulative provocation and alleged incident was a result of a

sudden fight as testified by the 1 st petitioner . 3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider principles of sentencing

followed by this Court

4. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the alleged

incident had taken place 13 years prior to the imposing of the said sentence

5. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the petitioners did not

have any previous convictions or had not committed any offence during the

trial

6. The sentences imposed on the petitioners are excessive in any event

Page 3 of 15

The Learned SSC for the respondent ra\sed a preliminary objection that the

petitioners have not explained any reason for this Court to exercise revisionary

powers when a right of appeal against the same order was available. The

petitioners, in their petition, stated that they had instructed their relatives to obtain

certified copies of the entire case record to lodge an appeal but the prescribed

appealable period lapsed when their relatives obtained the said certified case

record. According to paragraph 13 of the petition, the petitioners had requested the

Prison Authorities to lodge an appeal and however they were informed by the

Prison Authorities that the petitioners could not appeal due to the fact that they had

pleaded guilty.

In the case of Attorney General V. Ranasinghe and others [1993] 2 Sri L.R. 81,

it was held that,

" ... It is clear on a perusal of the judgment, that this Court refused to

exercise revisionary jurisdiction primarily on the basis that the petitioner

had not availed himself of the leave to appeal procedure set out in the Civil

Procedure Code ... We have to observe that this consideration does not apply

in relation to a criminal case where the jurisdiction is exercised in terms of

section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. furthermore we are

inclined to agree with the submission of the learned SSC that the decisions

of the Supreme Court in the cases of the Attorney-General vs. H N. de Silva

(2) and Gomes vs Leelaratne (3) firmly establish the principle that in

considering the propriety of a sentence that has been passed, this Court has

a wide power of review, in revision. This jurisdiction is not fettered by the

fact that Hon. Attorney-General has not availed of the right of appeal... "

Page 4 of 15

It was held in the case ofSeylan Bank V. T.hangaveil [2004] 2 Sri L.R 101, that,

"In this &pplication in revision the petitioner seeks to set aside the orders

dated 7.3.2002 and 10.01.2003 made by the learned District Judge. The

petitioner has filed this application on 17. 7.2003. It appears that there is a

delay of one year andfour months in respect of the order dated 7.3.2002 and

a delay of seven months from the order dated 10.01.2003. The petitioner has

not explained the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking

relief by way of revision, which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which

will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review should

be made promptly unless there are good reasons for the delay. The failure

on the part of the petitioner to explain the delay satisfactorily is by itself

fatal to the application ... JJ

It is manifestly clear that the revisionary power is not fettered merely because the

petitioner has not availed his right of appeal. We observe that this revision

application was filed on 19.02.2015 whereas the impugned judgment was delivered

on 26.01.2015. There had not been an unreasonable delay since the petitioners

have filed this revision application as soon as possible within another week.

The Learned SSC for the respondent further contended that 'the petitioners have

failed to tender a copy of the post mortem report of the deceased along with the

instant revision application. Further the petitioners have failed to state the reason

for such inability and failed to seek leave of this Court to furnish the said report

later in the petition.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners pointed out that the Learned

High Court Judge in his judgment stated that there were 6 injuries in the

deceased's body while medical evidence revealed that there were only 4 injuries.

Page 5 of 15

Accordingly it was argued that it demonstrqted that the Learned High Court Judge

has not analyzed the evidence as required by law.

The Learned SSC for the respondent submitted that the post mortem report makes

reference to 06 injuries out of which 04 injuries were external injuries whilst 02

were corresponding internal injuries.

However we are unable to consider this position without perusing the post mortem

report which is in fact a material document. Therefore we will not consider this

ground since the said report was not submitted by the petitioners.

The incident pertaining to the instant application is summarized as follows;

The deceased was the brother in law of the 1 st petitioner. The 1 st petitioner was the

father in law of the 2nd petitioner.

According to PW 01, the sister of the 1 st petitioner and the wife of the deceased,

she and her husband were seated with a distance of 6 feet from each other in their

house. Both petitioners had been seen running towards deceased's house in the

morning on 11.01.2002. The 1 st petitioner was armed with a keththa (2mlZS;Z5)) whilst

the 2nd petitioner was armed with a knife. The 1 st petitioner had jumped towards the

direction of the deceased and given a blow to the deceased with the keththa. The

PW 01 has seen, the said blow striking the chest of deceased. The 2nd petitioner . had also jumped in the direction of the deceased aiming the knife. Thereafter PW

01 had immediately escaped from the scene and the 1 st petitioner had chased her to

77 feet away. PW 01 had run to Gunarathne's house (PW 05) and had crept under a

bed where she remained for about 15 minutes. After PW 01 had narrated the

incident to PW 05 - Gunarathne, he had left for the deceased's house. PW 05 had

returned with Police around 12noon. Thereafter PW 01 had gone back to home

where she had seen the deceased lying on his face with blood.

Page 6 of 15

According to the evidence of the JMO, the first injury had been located next to the

left nipple of the deceased's body. The injury had thus been caused on the side in , which the heart was located. The 1 st injury had been identified as having been

capable of causing death of the deceased immediately after the receipt of the

injury. (Page 128 of the brief)

The 2nd injury was on the left side of the abdomen of the deceased. The said injury

had been identified as 3 Y2 inches long and Y2 inch wide. (Page 130 of the brief)

The 3rd injury was on the upper right side of the abdomen of the deceased. The said

injury was 2 inches long and 2 inches wide. A corresponding internal injury was to

the liver. (Page 130 of the brief)

The 4th injury was on the right side (lower) of abdomen which was 2 inches in

length and Y2 an inch in width and Y2 inches in depth.

The cause of death was identified as "the failure in heart and respiratory track

coupled with excessive bleeding" owing to the injuries caused. The JMO was

given an opportunity to examine a knife, which was recovered as a 27 recovery, by

PW 08, as stated by the 1 st petitioner. Accordingly the JMO was of the opinion that

"it was possible for the 4 injuries to be caused by the said knife". (Page 134 of the

brief)

The Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara had considered the number of injuries

that were inflicted on the deceased as per the testimony of PW Oland the fact that

the said testimony was corroborated by the evidence of the Judicial Medical

Officer.

The Learned President's Counsel contended that the Learned High Court Judge

failed to consider the harm caused to the 1 st petitioner by the deceased. It was

Page 7 of 15

submitted that according to the evidence of ~he police officer, the deceased had a

knife in his sarong. Accordingly it was contended that the deceased had no reason . to be armed with a knife on a day in which he did not attend to work. However we

observe that according to the evidence of PW 01, the deceased was helping her

with cutting 'gotu kola' in their house. It is imperative to note that the PW 08, who

found the said knife in deceased's waist, has also noticed that the knife was inside

another cover (Kolapath). Therefore it appears that even though the deceased had a

knife he had no time to use it against the petitioners as they attacked him suddenly.

Further the PW08 has testified that there were no blood stains on the said knife.

Therefore we are unable to agree with the contention of the petitioners that the

alleged incident which resulted in the death ofNeposingho was a sudden fight.

Further the Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners contended that the

Learned High Court Judge failed to consider whether petitioners have acted on

cumulative provocation. We observe that the evidence of the PW Oland the 1 st

petitioner demonstrated that the deceased and the petitioners had quarrels

regarding a land. The .1 st petitioner, in his evidence, has stated that the deceased's

family broke the 2nd petitioner's newly built house and set fire on it. The 1st

petitioner further testified that he was hospitalized due to an acid attack. However

he did not mention who threw acid on him. Further we observe that the Learned

Counsel who represented the petitioners in the High Court had informed Court that

an eye of the 1 st petitioner was injured due to acid was thrown on him by the two

sons of the deceased. All these evidence taken together amply demonstrate that

both parties were holding grudges against each other.

We observe that the Learned High Court Judge came to the following conclusion;

"cy~8azrl' ~ <fl25l 2iS)~~ ~e.;dc.!l2Sf G'e~ ~e2iS):> Q)1~G'~ G'a~ c.!ImG'm ~~e;)

r In the Criminal Law by Smith & Hoganl provocation is defined as follows;

"The common law rule was stated by Devlin J in what the Court of Criminal

Appeal described as a 'classic direction ', as follows:

"Provocation is some act, or series of acts, done by the dead man to

the accused, which would cause in any reasonable person, and

actually causes in the accused, a sudden and temporary loss of self-

control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or

her for the moment not master of his mind" [Duffy (1949) 1 All ER at

932n} ... "

In the case of Kattadige Amarasena V. The Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka [SC. Appeal 34/2015 - decided on 13.12.2017], it was observed that,

" ... Our Penal Code more particularly Sec 294 Exception (1) of the Code

Contemplates (a) offender deprived of self-control (b) By grave and sudden

provocation, and cause the death of the person who provoked the offender.

Penal Code does not refer to cumulative provocation. But our courts seem to

have dealt with the question of 'cumulative provocation in some decided

cases. One such case is Premalal Vs. A. G. This could be look at as a

development in law in that area ... "

In the case of Somalatha Kulasinghe and another V. The Attorney General

[C.A. No. 130-131109 decided on 17.07.2017] it was held that,

" ... The Judicial Medical Officer has observed 17 cut injuries and two stab

injuries on the dead body. Therefore, the retaliation is so brutal as to show

that it proceeded from a murderous intention. Therefore, the plea of

1 (8

th Edition, Butterworths, 1996, pg. 361)

Page 9 of 15

cumulative provocation would not be successful. The basis is that the

extreme brutality of the retaliation act leads to the inference of precedent , malice. (See; R V Holloway, 1628, Cro Car 131, All ER 1979 at page 131.)"

Considering above we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was

correct in coming to the aforesaid conclusion. Therefore we do not see any failure

on the part of the Learned High Court Judge as contended by the Learned

President's Counsel for the petitioners.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners contended that there was no

eye witness who saw the 2nd petitioner committing the alleged act. We are of the

view that the participation of the 2nd petitioner cannot be excluded since the

evidence shows that both the petitioners entered the scene of crime together, armed

with weapons. Therefore the 2nd petitioner clearly entertained a common

murderous intention with the 1 st petitioner to cause the death of the deceased.

Furthermore we are of the view that an accused who pleaded guilty to the charge at

the stage of trial is not entitled to deny his participation, of the said charge, at the

stage of appeal.

We observe that the Learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the

testimony of PW 01 with regard to the acts committed by the petitioners, the

testimony of the JMO in relation to the injuries and the fact that the testimony of

PW 01 was corroborated by the JMO's evidence before imposing the sentence.

In the case of Attorney General V. Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and another [1995] 1

Sri L.R 157 it was held that,

"In determining the proper sentence the Judge should consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

Page 10 of 15

I

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found guilty

r and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The Judge should also take into account the nature of the loss

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

detection ... "

In the case of The Attorney General V. Mendis [1995] 1 Sri L.R. 138 it was held

that,

"In our view once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea,

or after trial, the Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That is to

decide what sentence is to be imposed on the accused who has been

convicted. In doing so he has to consider the point of view of the accused on

the one hand and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge

must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner in

which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which it

has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in

committing the crime. The Trial Judge who has the sole discretion in

imposing a sentence which is appropriate having regard to the criteria set

out above should in our view not to surrender this sacred right and duty to

any other person, be it counselor accused or any other person ... "

Page 11 of 15.

In the case of Sevaka Perumal etc. V. State of Tamil Nadu [AIR 1991 S.C.

1463],

" .... Protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the

object of law which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.

Therefore, law as a corner-stone of the edifice of order should meet the

challenges confronting the society... Therefore, undue sympathy to impose

inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine

the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long

endure under serious threats. If the court did not protect the injured, the

injured would then resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore, the duty of

every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the

offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc ... "

In light of above it is understood that a trial Judge should consider the matter

before him from the point of view of the offender as well as the victim and the

society.

In the case of The Attorney General V. H.N. de Silva [57 NLR 121], it was held

that,

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

. should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

Page 12 of 15 .

charged. He should also regard the f!ffect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective ... " ,

These decisions emphasize that a Judge should be mindful to strike a balance

between the gravity of an offence and the sentence imposed. Indeed there should

be proportionality.

In the case of Asan Mohamed Rizwan V. Attorney General rCA (PHC) APN

14112013 - decided on 25.03.2015 ], Justice Chithrasiri has made an observation

with regard to section 297 of the Penal Code in the following manner;

"In order to apply the law referred to above, it is necessary to ascertain

whether the offender had the intention of causing death or whether he/she

had only the knowledge in committing the said offence. Intention, as opposed

to the Knowledge of a person, can be determined only upon considering the

circumstances of each case. If the circumstances of a particular incident

show that there had been intention to kill, then the sentence extends up to

20 years of imprisonment, while the punishment is restricted to ten years

of imprisonment if the offender had only the knowledge as to the

consequences of the wrongful act of the accused. Then the issue is to

determine whether or not the accused had the intention of causing the death

or he had only the knowledge as to the consequences. This can be

ascertained basically by looking at the prior conduct of the offender as well

as the other circumstances of the case ... "(Emphasis added)

We observe that the punishment extends up to 20 years of Rigorous Imprisonment

since the instant case falls within the limb 0 1 of section 297 of the Penal Code.

In the aforesaid case of Asan Mohamed it was further held that,

Page 13 of 15

"Sentencing is an important aspect in the administration of criminal justice

system. A sentence ranges from death penalty to the mere censure in the , form of good behavior bond or probation. There are multiple considerations

relevant to the determination of a sentence. The most important

consideration is the seriousness of the crime. Jurisprudentially, this position

is persuasive despite pragmatic difficulties associated with matching the

harshness of the sanction to the severity of the crime. (San Diego Law

Review Vol.51 No.2 Spring 2014 page 343 - Article by Mirko Bagaric Dean

& Professor of Law Deaking University, Melbourne)

The judges are to pass lawful and appropriate sentence upon the accused

being convicted. In doing so, judges are to address their minds to the

objective of sentencing particularly when exercising the discretion given to

them under the law. Then only a correct sentence could be passed upon a

convicted accused. If not, criticism on lack of uniformity, consistency and

transparency in imposing sentences are bound to surface. Therefore, it is

necessary for the judges to keep in mind the objectives of sentencing and

also the sentencing guidelines, in order to arrive at the correct and

appropriate decision ... "

Thereafter Justice Chithrasiri has listed down several objectives of sentencing such

as to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the

circumstances, to protect the community from offender and to deter offenders or

other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners, in his written submissions,

submitted that the accused's request to plead guilty at the outset before trial was

rejected by the prosecution since the prosecution wished to proceed to trial by

leading evidence. However we do not see such request either in the journal entries

or the proceedings. Therefore the Learned High Court Judge was correct in

Page 14 of 15

, ) ..

considering that the petitioners waited until the prosecution case to be concluded in

order to plead guilty to a lesser offence.

r Further it was contended for the petitioners that the alleged incident took place in

the year 2002 and 13 years had passed by the time the Learned Trial Judge made

his judgment. It is pertinent to note that the time period of a trial cannot be

considered as a mitigatory factor in imposing sentence on an accused since trials in

our Courts take a considerable time period.

Considering above we are of the view that the sentence imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge is not excessive and it is well within law. Therefore we affirm

the judgment dated 26.01.2015.

Accordingly the revision application is hereby dismissed.
