The Plaintiff~ Respondent instituted this action in the District Court of Kaluatara to have

the corpus described in the schedule, partitioned amop.g the co~owners named therein as

Defendants.

The trial proceeded on 26 issues which are contained at pages 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162,

163, 164 and 284 in the appeal brief. The issues of the 18th Defendant/Appellant are at pages

159.

At the trial the 18th Defend~.nt~ Appellant gave evidence which is found at pages 275 to 305

in the brief. The Counsel for the 5th and 6th Defendants in the course of cross examining

the 18th Defendant~Appellant raised two issues (25.1, 25.11), which are at page 284 of the

brief. The issues are;

a. Has the Donee, named in Deed No.4703 dated 30:08.1855 (18V 1) accepted the deed

according to law?

b. If it is not so, does the 18th Defendant derive rights?

Both these two were answered by the learned District Judge of Kalutara in the negative in

the judgment he delivered on 05.12.1995, which is contained at pages 307 at 329 in the

brief.

2

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 18th Defendant has preferred this appeal seeking

the reliefs set out in the Petitioner of appeal.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this Court, it was agreed among the

parties to confine the argument as to whether document marked 18Vl, the alleged deed of

gift (at pages 513 to 515 in the appeal brief) is valid enough to convey title in terms of the

Muslim Law. All counsel addressed Court on this question of law and have since filed

written submissions on dle question of law.

The learned trial Judge had come to the finding that in view of the fact that the donee in

the alleged deed of gift, hlip- not accepted the gift, no rjght or title devolved upon the Igrh

Defendant, who is claiming rights under the said deed. The question of law has to be

answered having regard to Muslim law since donations among Muslims are governed by

Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance No 10 of 1931.

Section 3 of the Ordinance states as follows:~

"For the purposes of avoiding and removing all doubts it is hereby declared that the law applicable

to donations not involving usufructs and trusts, and made by Muslims domiciled in Sri Lanka or

,L owning immovable pr(1!Jerty in Sri Lanka, shall be the Muslim law governing the sect to which the

donor belongs:

Provided that no deed of donation shall be deemed to be irrevocable unless it is so stated in the deed,

and the delivery of the .ieed to the donee shall be accepted as evidence of delivery of possession of the

movable or the immovat,le property donated by the deed." ,

So it is the substantive Wiuslim law that will prevail with regard to the question that has

arisen before this Court- Did the Donee, named in Deed No.4703 dated 30.08.1855 (18Vl)

accept the donation? Is acceptance of a gift mandatory in Muslim Law?

,/

The Muslim Law distinguishes two kinds of gifts (properly so called) by the terms sudakah

and hiba. Both are voluntary transfers of property without consideration; in the former the

motive is to acquire religious merit, in the latter affection towards the donee, (Wilson's

Anglo~Mohammedan Law, 6th Ed., p.323). Gifts are rendered valid by tender or intention,

acceptance, and seizin or possession" (Hedaya p.482). The donee of a thing acquires no right

over it, unless he actually takes possession. This in; '1ortant condition is found in an

express saying of the Holr Prophet (p.b.u.h.), that "a gift is not valid unless possessed".

(Baillie Digest ofMohammedon Law p.508).

Conditions necessary for a Donation to be valid under Muslim Law

Under the Muslim Law, for a gift to be valid, there must prevail three conditions. The three conditions necessary to c,1nstitute a valid donation, inter vivos, under the Muhammadan Law are;

(1) manifestation of the \vi'~;h or intention to give on the part of the donor,

(2) the acceptance by the donee either impliedly or expressly, and

(3) the taking of possession of the subject matter of the gift by the donee either actually or

constructively (l Ameer Ali 4th Ed.,p 41 see Affefudeen vs. Periatamby (1911) 14 N.LR 295.

Unless these three cond.itions are present, a gift cannot be good according to the

, Muhammedan law~see Casie Chetty v Mohamed Saleem 42 N.LR 41; Sultan v Pieris 35

N.LR 57; Weerasekera v'Peiris 34 N.LR 281 (p.e).

In the case of Kulu Beg Afzal Beg v. GuIzar Beg Lal Beg, AIR 1946 NAG 357 it was held:

"once the donor upholds' the gift and the donee accepts it, it is a valid gift, and a stranger

cannot question its validjty on the grounds of want of delivery of possession". This Indian

judgment is also indicative of the mandatory requirement of acceptance as a fundamental

requirement for there to b~ a valid gift.

4

The impugned deed of gift is found at pages 513 to 515 of the brief. It is quite manifest upon

the perusal of the deed that the donee had not accepted 'the said gift.

The judgment of learned trial Judge proceeds on the basis that the gift had not been

accepted and on the strength of authorities cited above it is correct both in law and on

facts.

In the circumstances I would affirm the judgment dated 15.12.1995 entered by the learned

trial Judge of Kalutara and dismiss the appeal of the 18th Defendant~Appellant and 20th

Defendant~ Appellant.
