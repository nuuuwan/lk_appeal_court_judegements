This is an appeal from an order dated 14.07.2015 made by the learned High Court judge of the

North Western Province holden in Chilaw.

The argument in this matter was taken up on 04.05.2018 and concluded on 03.07.2018. At the

conclusion of the argument parties informed Court that they agree to be bound by the

judgement to be delivered in CA(PHC) 116/2015 as the issues in the two cases are the same.

We have today delivered judgment in CA(PHC) 116/2015 allowing the appeal and setting aside

the order dated 14.07.2015 made by the learned High Court judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw.

Accordingly, for the reasons set out more fully in the said judgment, we allow this appeal and

set aside order dated 14.07.2015 made by the learned High Court judge of the North Western

Province holden in Chilaw.
