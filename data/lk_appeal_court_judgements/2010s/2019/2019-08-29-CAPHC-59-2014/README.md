Decided on: 27.08.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Respondent (Upali Seneviratne) instituted this action in the

Magistrates Court of Avissawella against the Appellant

(Prabhashana Oknapitiya) under section 66 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act seeking restoration of possession on the

ground that the Appellant dispossessed him immediately

preceding two months from the date of filing the action. The

Appellant sought dismissal of the Respondents action on the

ground that the latter was not in possession. After inquiry, the

learned Magistrate held with the Appellant. This order was

reversed by the High Court in revision. This appeal is against

the Judgment of the High Court.

Both parties admit that Ananda Ganegoda was one time the

owner of the land in suit and he obtained possession of the land

from the District Court through execution of a writ on

23.09.1994 (vide V3).

It is the position of the Respondent that the said Ananda

Ganegoda transferred the land by Deed No. 1011 dated

24.11.1983 to Premachandra, and Premachandra transferred it

to the Respondent by Deed No.18537 on 25.12.2010, and

3

thereafter the Respondent had been in possession until he was

dispossessed by the Appellant on or around 28.06.2012.

Conversely, the position of the Appellant is that the said Ananda

Ganegoda transferred the land by Deed No. 612 dated

22.06.2012 to Neil Wijeratne, and Neil Wijeratne transferred it to

the Appellant by Deed No. 613 dated 23.06.2012, and thereafter

the Appellant went into possession of the land. He says that the

Respondent was not in possession to dispossess.

Ananda Ganegoda by tendering an affidavit marked V8 denies

that he transferred the land to Premachandra, and says that it is

a fraudulent Deed. He has made a complaint to that effect to

the police (vide V9), and it appears that the police have initiated

an investigation into it.

If Ananda Ganegoda transferred the land by Deed No. 1011

dated 24.11.1983 to Premachandra, it is not clear how and why,

Ananda Ganegoda, admittedly, got possession of the land from

the District Court through execution of a writ on 23.09.1994,

that is, more than 10 years after the alleged transfer.

It is the position of Ananda Ganegoda that until he transferred

the land to Neil Wijeratne, he was in possession of the land.

The Respondent has produced a number of affidavits from

people claiming to be neighbours that the Respondent had been

in possession of the land.

Not to be outdone, the Appellant has also tendered a number of

affidavits from people claiming to be neighbours that Ananda

Ganegoda had been in possession of the land.

4

Out of these two sets of affidavits, the learned High Court Judge

has come to the conclusion that the affidavits tendered by the

Respondent are clearer than those of the Appellant on the

question of possession in that the Respondents affidavits

explain how the land was possessed by the Respondent. It is on

that basis, predominantly, the learned High Court Judge held

with the Respondent.

The affidavits tendered by both parties stating completely

contradictory positions vis--vis possession, in my view, are self-

serving documents. Almost all the affidavits tendered by the

Respondents (vide P6-P15) which the learned High Court Judge

heavily relied on to overturn the order of the Magistrates Court

have been prepared in the same style making slight changes in

the computer for the purpose of this case. They cannot, in my

view, be taken seriously.

Therefore it is prudent to place reliance on available

independent items of evidence to come to a conclusion on

possession.

The standpoint taken up by Ananda Ganegoda that the Deed

relied on by the Respondent is a fraudulent Deed is important.

The fact that he got possession of the land from the District

Court in 1994 is also very relevant. V22 police complaint made

by Ananda Ganegoda on 13.05.2000 also establishes his

continuation of possession. There is no evidence to establish

that Ananda Ganegoda surrendered his possession to

Premachandra who is the predecessor in title of the Respondent.

For the aforesaid reasons, it is my considered view that the order

of the learned Magistrate is correct.

5

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court and restore the order

of the learned Magistrate.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent has stated

that the learned Magistrate has granted extra reliefs to the

Appellant when he has only asked for dismissal of the action of

the Respondent. As the Respondent has admitted that the

Appellant is in possession of the land on the date of filing the

action, and sought restoration of possession, dismissal of the

Respondents action will serve the purpose.

The Respondent can file an action in the District Court to

vindicate his rights, if so advised.

I find that the last sentence of the Judgment of the High Court is

an order to maintain the status quo. That is in consonance with

this Judgment.

Appeal allowed. No costs.
