Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Appellant.

Respondents.

Decided on: 22.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking

declaration of title to the premises described in the second

paragraph to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom

and damages. The defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiffs

action on the basis that she has prescribed to the premises.

After trial the learned District Judge entered Judgment for the

plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the defendant.

By virtue of the Certificate of Sale issued under the hand of the

District Judge of Galle marked P10, Tharalis de Silva became

the owner of Lot 12 in Plan marked Y together with the building

standing thereon, which is the premises in suit. Then Tharalis

de Silva has by Deed marked P11 transferred it to Senehelatha

Mendis, and Senehelatha Mendis has in turn transferred it to

the plaintiff by Deed marked P12. There cannot be any dispute

that the plaintiff is the owner of the said premises.

As seen from the Plan marked Y, the building marked 22 is

standing on Lot 12 from the time the Certificate of Sale was

issued. This building marked 22, has, as seen from the Plan

3

marked X, been separated into two as 22A and 22B (may be for

convenience or clarity). Admittedly, 22A has been given on rent

to the co-operative society, and 22B is being occupied by the

defendant.

It is the position of the plaintiff, which was accepted by the

learned District Judge, that the plaintiffs deceased husband

came into possession of 22B with the leave and licence of the

plaintiff, and after the death of the husband, the defendant

continued in occupation.

As this is a clear-cut case, there is no necessity for me to

scrutinize the voluminous of evidence led by the plaintiff at the

trial.

The defendant in her evidence clearly admits that she together

with her husband and children came into a portion of the

building (22B); but says that she does not know who the owner

of that building is, who the keys of that building were taken

from, who pays the assessment rates to the building etc.

Assessment rates are being paid by the plaintiff as seen from Y1-

Y17. She tries to pretend that she is unaware of the owner of

the premises. She never says that she maintained adverse

possession against the plaintiff who is the true owner of the

premises. This building was not an abandoned building.

However, if I may say so, the cat is out of the bag, when she, by

issue No.12, takes up the position that she is entitled to recover

a sum of Rs. 40,000/= for improvements made to the premises

from the plaintiff.

A person who claims prescriptive title against the rightful owner

who has the paper title has a very heavy burden to prove all the

requirements prescribed in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Mere possession over ten years is not prescriptive

possession. The possession shall be by title adverse to or

independent of that of the rightful owner. One cannot establish

prescriptive title in the air as the defendant in this case attempts

to do. "A facile story of walking into abandoned premises after

the Japanese air raid constitutes material far too slender to found

a claim based on prescriptive title."1

There is another important point to be stressed. Where a party

invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in

order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly

on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights."2 This the defendant has failed to do.

There is no necessity further to waste judicial time. There is

absolutely no evidence to prove prescriptive title by the

defendant. The appeal filed nearly two decades ago is manifestly

devoid of merit.

Judgement of the District Court is affirmed and the appeal is

dismissed with costs.
