01. The Petitioner and his wife were indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura

with 1 st and 2nd counts on offences punishable under sections 308(a) 2 and

298 of the Penal Code respectively. Evidence of prosecution witnesses

No.O I and 02 had been led before the learned High Court Judge Mr.

R.M.P.S.K. Ratnayake and thereafter witnesses No. 05, 06, 03, 24, 25, 26,

11, 14 were led before the learned High Court Judge Mr. Manjula

Thilakaratne. When the matter was called for trial on 11.06.2018, it was the

learned High Court Judge Mr. K. Weeraman who presided, as Mr.

2

,. ,

Thilakaratne had gone on transfer to another Court. On that day the case was

re-fixed for 25.09.2018 for want of witnesses.

02. Thereafter, the case was called on 25.09.2018 for trial and the prosecution

moved for summons on witness No.24. According to the proceedings on

record, the defence counsel has requested Court to send the case to be heard

by Mr. Thilakaratne the learned High Court Judge, as evidence of more

witnesses were recorded before him. At that stage, the learned High Court

Judge has questioned the defence counsel as to whether Mr. Thilakaratne

had recorded any demeanour or deportment of any witnesses, where the

defence counsel answered in the negative. Hence, the learned High Court

Judge refused the application by the defence to send the case back to his

predecessor Mr. Thilakaratne. Being aggrieved by the said order, the

petitioner filed the instant application to get it revised.

03. I have taken into consideration, the petition with the documents filed

including the proceedings in the High Court, oral submissions made by the

counsel in support of the same and the written submissions filed on behalf of

the Petitioner and the Respondent.

04. Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the learned High Court Judge erred

when he refused to send the case to his predecessor as Mr. Thilakaratne HCJ

has heard the evidence of main witnesses for the prosecution. It is further

submitted that the judge who heard the case should decide the case. The

practice of the Court had been to send the case to His Lordship the Chief

Justice to appoint the Judge who heard the case to hear and conclude,

counsel submitted. The contention of the petitioner is that the present High

3

Court Judge could not observe the demeanour of the witnesses whose

evidence was recorded before his predecessor. He moves notice on the

Respondent.

05. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that section 48 of the Judicature Act

provides for a situation where continuation of proceedings before a

succeeding Judge who is empowered to act on the already recorded

evidence. Succeeding Judge is also empowered to re-summon the witnesses

already testified. It is submitted that the existence of exceptional

circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of powers of revision and

that the Petitioner has failed to establish the existence of exceptional

circumstances.

06. Section 48 of the Judicature Act as amended has made clear provision for

continuing any case begun before a Judge becoming disabled. Section 48

provides:

"48. In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from

office, absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before

whom any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter whether on any

inquiry preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been

instituted or is pending such action, prosecution, proceeding or

matter may be continued before the successor of such Judge who shall

have power to act on the evidence already recorded by his

predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks fit, to re-

summon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh:

4

\ .,

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or

matter (except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is

continued before the successor of any such Judge, the accused may

demand that the witnesses be re-summoned and reheard. "

07. Application of section 48 when a Judge is transferred to another station was

discussed by His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew in case of Herath

Mudiyanselage Ariyaratne V. Republic of Sri Lanka. (CA 30712006

{17. 7.2013J) where it was said:

' ... I now again turn to the contention that succeeding HCJ in a

criminal trial cannot, under Section 48 of the Judicature Act, continue

with the proceedings recorded before his predecessor. When a HCJ is

transferred from his station he ceases to exercise his jurisdiction in

his area and thereby he suffers from disability to function as HCJ of

the area. Thus, in my view, transfer of a HCJ from a station is covered

by the words 'other disability' in Section 48 of the Judicature Act. '

08. It is clear by plain reading of section 48, that the successor Judge has the

discretion to continue with the case subject to the proviso. It is obvious that

the proviso is to safeguard the right of accused to a fair trial in a criminal

case, as the successor Judge would be able to see the demeanour of a witness

already led, if necessary. For that purpose, the accused is given the

opportunity to demand that the witness be re-summoned and reheard.

'-

09. Counsel for the Petitioner made submissions on the practice of Court to

forward the case to His Lordship the Chief Justice requesting him to

nominate the predecessor Judge to hear the case. There had been instances

where it had happened, but not as a practice. There had been instances where

the High Court Judge had concluded the case before him, but transferred

before he delivered the judgment. In instances like that it would be more

practical and sensible to make such a request in the interest of justice.

Situation in this case is different. Prosecution has not even closed its case.

10. In case of Vilma Dissanayake and Others V. Leslie Dharmaratne {2008J 2

Sri L.R page 184 Court held;

'It is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue proceedings

since there are change of Judges holding office in a particular Court

due to transfers, promotions and the like. It is in these circumstances

that Section 48 was amended giving discretion to a judge to continue

with the proceedings.

The exercise of such discretion should not be disturbed unless

there are serious issues with regard to the demeanour of any witness

recorded by the Judge who previously heard the case'

11. The learned High Court Judge in this case, on 25.09.2018 had correctly

inquired whether his predecessor Judge had recorded any demeanour or

deportment of any witnesses, where the defence counsel had answered in the

negative. He has even referred to the case of Vilma Dissanayake (Supra)

when he decided to refuse the application to send the case to his predecessor.

6

12. When deciding to continue with the case acting in terms of Section 48, the

Judge need not give reasons for his decision. This was discussed in Herath

Mudiyanselage Ariyaratne V. Republic of Sri Lanka (supra). In that case it

was said;

"Learned PC submitted that if the succeeding Judge, acting

under section 48 of the Act, decides to continue with the case, he must,

before doing so, make an order giving reasons for his decision. He

urged this ground without prejudice to his first ground. I now advert

to this contention. Section 48 of the Judicature Act does not state that if the succeeding Judge decides to continue with the case, he should

give his reasons. Assuming without conceding that he should give

reasons for his decision what are the matters that he should discuss.

He has to necessarily comment on the credibility of the witnesses. If

he expresses an opinion about the credibility of the witnesses who had

already given evidence an objection can be raised to the effect that he

had decided the credibility of witnesses before hearing the full case.

When I consider all these matters, I am of the opinion that there is no

necessity for the succeeding Judge to make an order giving his

reasons for his decision to continue with the evidence already

recorded. For these reasons, I am unable to agree with the submission

of the learned Pc. "

13. In the above premise, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge

correctly decided to continue with the case. It is up to the Petitioner to make

an application if he so wishes in terms of the proviso to Section 48.

7

As no prima facie case established by the Petitioner, application for notice to

the Respondent is refused.

Application dismissed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J

I agree.
