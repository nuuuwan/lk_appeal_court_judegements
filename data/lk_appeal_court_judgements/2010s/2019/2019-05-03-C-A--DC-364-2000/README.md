19.06.2018

T

he Plaintiff/Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiffs") seek

to impugn the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Matugama dated

02.06.2000 on the ground that he had proceeded to reject the plaint for perceived defects

therein even though a full trial had taken place.

The learned Additional District Judge has made order that the plaint ought to be rejected

for the reason that it is defective. The learned Additional District Judge further states

that since the plaint is defective and ought to be rejected, it is not necessary to consider

the statements of claim of the Defendants or the issues.

The learned Counsel for the 4th Defendant/Respondent countered the submissions of

Plaintiff/Appellants by contending that the rejection of the plaint at the conclusion of

the trial did amount to a dismissal of the action and in such an event no prejudice has

been caused to the Plaintiff/Appellants in the case because the Plaintiff/Appellants have

not established their case at all by their failure to prove the pedigree and the title to the

corpus.

It is axiomatic that once issues are framed, the case which the Court has to hear and

determine becomes crystallized in the issues and the pleadings recede to the

background/see Hanaffi v. NaUamma (1998) 1 Sri LR. 73

2

Once issues are accepted by Court, the case goes to trial on the issues and evidence is led

by parties to establish the issues. The issues accepted by Court in this case are found

principally at page 49 of the appeal brief and the following two issues summarize the

questions to be determined:-

Issus No.3: Was Punchi Wedikkarage Leenis Appu the original owner of the land

depicted as No.1 by virtue of long possession?

Issus No.4: Does the title of the said Leenis Appu devolve on the l

S

\ 2nd, 3rd and 6th

Defendants and the Plaintiffs?

The Plaintiff-Appellants traced their title to the original ownership of Leenis Appu and

framed Issue No.3 on its account.

The Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellants took this Court quite extensively through the

evidence led in the case and contended that no evaluation of the evidence has been

undertakes by the learned Additional District Judge of Matugama. No answers have been

proffered by the learned Additional District Judge having regard to the evidence that had

been placed before Court.

There have been rival claims made before the learned Additional District Judge of

Matugama both by the Plaintiff-Appellants and the 4th Defendant-Respondent. Whilst the

Plaintiffs claimed title by prescription through Leenis Appu, the 4th Defendant too sought

to establish his title by prescription tracing the devolution from his grandfather Garlis

Singho. No title deeds were produced by either party and their rival claims to the land

revolved around the prescriptive title of their respective predecessors namely Leenis Appu

and Garlis Singho. In fact it is a given or a donnee that in a partition action, title can be

established even without title deeds to the corpus. But there appears to be a virtual

abdication of duty on the part of the learned Additional District Judge of Matugama to

investigate title by undertaking an evaluation of evidence in order to ascertain whether

prescriptive title has been established.

3

The record teems with evidence on the part of both the Plaintiff~Appellants and the 4 th

Defendant ~Respondent but the learned Additional District Judge of Matugma does not

even refer to them in his judgment. For instance, in order to establish title of Leenis Appu

who, according to the Plaintiffs, was the original owner of the corpus, the Plaintiffs

produced through an officer of the Surveyor General's Department a document marked

Ol;I or PI (page 104 of appeal brief). PI is an extract of field notes made by an officer of

the Surveyor General's Department. The Plaintiffs' purpose was to show that as per the

said field notes, Leenis Appu was the original owner of the corpus. In fact document PI

depicts Lot 349 which is the subject~matter of this partition action. The notation on PI

goes as follows: ~

"Lot 349

Kadawalawatta Pitakattiya

Chena Crown,

Contains no Permanent Cultivations

Claimed by Punchi Weddikkarage Leenis Appu"

PI the field notes were prepared in 1923 and Mr. Vidura Ranawaka for the 4th Defendant~

Respondents argued that PI clearly showed that the subject ~matter was a crown land

and Leenis Appu, however long his possession had been, could not have prescribed against

the state. Mrs. Chamantha Weerakoon Unamboowe for the Plaintiff~Appellants

submitted PI clearly showed that Leenis Appu the predecessor of the Plaintiffs had been in

possession of the land as far back as 1923.

The Counsel for the 4 th Defendant~ Respondent took up the position that since Lot 349 is

designated as Crown land, there cannot be prescription on the part of the Plaintiffs and if

it is crown land, no partition decree could be entered in respect of the land.

It has to be remembered that when PI was produced by an officer of the Surveyor

General's Department, the 4th Defendant~Respondent never objected to this document

being marked in evidence. There are only 2 questions posed to the officer in cross ~

examination and none of the questions related to any crown land being involved in the

4

subject ~matter. In other words the 4th Defendant could have cross ~examined the witness

on the basis that the land was a crown land. It has to be noted that there is a notation in

Pl to the effect Leenis Appu had disputed the claim of the crown and this stance was not

challenged at all by the 4th Defendant. It was argued by Mrs. Chamantha Weerakoon

Unamboowe for the Plaintiff~ Appellants that the failure to cross ~examine the officer of

the Survey~General's Department showed that the 4th Defendant knew that it was

private land.

It would appear that the case below had not heen conducted on the basis that Lot 349

was a crown land. Mr. Vidura Ranawaka argued though that it was indeed a crown land.

The title of the crown could be defeated only by a Crown grant. It was his contention

that no such evidence of a Crown grant was placed before the learned Additional District

Judge of Matugama.

It is trite that whether a land is a crown land or a private land is a question of fact that

has to be resolved having regard to the evidence placed before Court and there is no

evaluation of evidence at all on this point. The learned Additional District Judge has

proceeded to reject the plaint and in my view it is an abdication of the duty cast upon

him in terms of Section 25 of the Partition Law.

None of the points of contest that were raised in the case have been answered by the trier

of fact. If after the formulation of issues the pleadings recede to the background, it is the

points of contest on which parties have led evidence and it is the bounden duty of the

learned District Judge to have reached his conclusions on the points of contest. The

judgment dated 02.06.2000 is thus devoid of reasons and vitiated by a fundamental vice.

It is preposterous on the part of the learned Additional District Judge to reach out to the

plaint and dismiss it citing inconsistencies in the plaint, when evidence has been led by

the disputants. It is my view that the irregular procedure followed by the learned

Additional District Judge has eventuated in a miscarriage of justice which transcends the

bounds of procedural error. It is manifest upon an appeal that there is a grievous failure

5

t to indulge in a thorough investigation of title, the Court should set aside the decree' and

make an order for a proper investigation ~ Sumanawathje v. Andreas (2003) 3 Sri.lR 324.

In the circumstances I set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Matugama dated 02.06.2000 and order a trial de novo.

Though I quite reluctantly take the decision to remit the case back to the District Court

to directing a trial de novo owing to a long lapse of time that the proceedings of this case

have traversed in its labyrinthine path, I direct the learned District Judge of Matugama to

conclude the trial based on the same pleadings as expeditiously as he could. The Court

may act upon the evidence that has already been led.
