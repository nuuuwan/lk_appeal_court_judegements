ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal by the 1st accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the "appellant") challenging his conviction by the High Court of

Negombo for committing murder of one P. Selvam on or about 10.0S.2005 at

Kochchikade and the consequent imposition of sentence of death. The 2nd

accused who was also indicted along with the appellant had been

acquitted after trial by the High Court.

The prosecution presented its case based on several items of

circumstantial evidence, which had been led through a lay wihlesses and

official wihlesses including Registrar of Finger Prints.

It was elicited through the lay wihless Wasanthi that the deceased

had lived in the adjoining premises in which he operated a scrap iron

2

collection business. The appellant, who was selling brooms as a door to

door salesman to earn a living, used to visit the deceased and was known

to the witness as well. He used to bring his merchandise whenever he

visited the deceased seeking shelter.

The date of the incident is 10.08.2005, The appellant and the 2nd

accused had arrived in the previous evening and spent the night with the

deceased in his scrap iron shop. Witness Wasanthi had borrowed bedding

items for the visitors from another neighbour (Kalyani) late in that

evening upon the request of the appellant. These items included two

pillows and two bed sheets. One of the bed sheets (PI) was identified by

the witness as the one she had handed over that evening to the appellant

and the 2nd accused.

She woke up in the early hours of the following morning as she

heard someone calling her out "Akka". The appellant and the 2nd accused

had then entered her house forcibly and tried to strangle her. She told

them to take whatever they wanted. They took her wrist watch and some

cash from the almirah. Then they have tied her hands with a nylon rope

and fled the scene.

Later she struggled herself free and went to the deceased's shop

seeking his help. The witness then realised the back door of the deceased's

shop was left open and when peeped through, seen his naked body lying

on the ground. She then alerted her other neighbours and thereafter made

a complaint to Police about the death of the deceased and also of the

robbery. She subsequently made another statement to the Police

implicating the appellant and the 2nd accused and explained her reason.

3

She said the appellant had threatened her with death and therefore she did

not reveal his name when she made her initial statement to the Police.

Kochcikade Police investigated the incident. They received 1st

information on 10.08.2005 at 9.55 am from Wasanthi. CI Samarajeewa visited

the crime scene and made notes. The body of the deceased was lying on

the floor in the rear part of his scrap iron shop besides a bed. There was a

bicycle near the body. Hands were tied at his back with a green colour

cloth while his legs were tied with a bed sheet (PI) and in addition a rope

had been used to tie both hands and legs together. There was blood on his

face. He also noted the brooms and other cleaning instruments allegedly

left behind by the appellant and the 2nd accused in the deceased's shop,

who had arrived there in the previous evening. He instructed his officers

to call for RFP to inspect the crime scene as he found three empty liquor

bottles. Officer Abeysuriya of RFP visited the crime scene and had found

four finger prints. He uplifted two prints from a liquor bottle found in the

scrap metal shop, one from a jam bottle found near an almirah in Kalyani's

house and another one, on the door of the said almirah.

Samarajeewa also visited Wasanthi's house, which was located about

15 feet away from the scrap iron shop. He observed a blue coloured nylon

rope and an iron bar on her bed. IP Semasiri arrested the appellant on

13.01.2006 apparently upon information provided by the 1st informant as

to his identity.

RFP Bandara confirmed that he found two finger prints from the

liquor bottle and another on a jam bottle matching with the finger prints of

the appellant that had been forwarded to him by Kochchikade Police. One

4

print that had been uplifted from an almirah, which belonged to the 1st

informant, had to be rejected due to its poor quality.

The deceased had been smothered prior to his death from manual

strangulation.

With this factual background, this Court could now turn to consider

the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant.

At the hearing of the appeal, learned Counsel for the appellant

referred to several determinations made by the trial Court on credibility of

witnesses and facts. She sought to challenge them on the basis that the trial

Court had reached erroneous conclusions over them.

In relation to issue of credibility of the lay witness Wasanthi, learned

Cowlsel for the appellant had highlighted the discrepancy in the

prosecution that although the witness claimed armed robbery by the

appellant and the 2nd accused, there was no investigation upon that

complaint undertaken by the Police and, as such, there is no charge

contained in the indictment alleging robbery, which is a strong indication

of the fact that the prosecution itself was not sure as to the genuineness of

the claim of robbery. If that is the case, then the indivisibility of her

credibility would render her evidence, in relation to the murder, clearly

unrelia ble.

In addition, learned Counsel contended that the trial Court had

failed to consider the probability of the version of events as narrated by

this witness on the basis that she made no cries when the intruders have

entered forcefully into her house and it is equally improbable that any

murderer would think of robbing her after committing a murder since the

5

natural tendency of such a person has to get away from the scene of

crime to prevent discovery of his identity and apprehension. She also

complained that the trial Court adduced unjustifiable reasons for

downplaying a vital omission marked off her evidence on the footing that

the witness had failed to mention the appellant's name in her 1st statement

although she knew him well.

Another point raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant is that

the trial Court erroneously treated the finding of a matching finger print in

the jam bottle had corroborated Wasanthi's evidence.

Learned DSG, in his submissions referred to the fact that the witness

Wasanthi had no reason to implicate the appellant to the murder if it was

not the truth and the identificalion of the bed sheet (Pl) by other

independent witnesses lend credence to her version of events. He also

referred to the items of evidence that reflect the fact not only the local

police but also the officers from RFP had visited her house and have even

uplifted two finger prints that were there. In replying to the submissions of

the appellant on the evidence of a finger print found in the jam bottle is in

fact hearsay, learned DSG stated that there is clear evidence that the jam

bottle was recovered from the house of the witness and not from the

deceased's as the appellant claims and therefore the determination by the

trial Court on that point could not be faulted.

CI Samarajeewa had visited the three roomed house of Kalyani

which was located about 15 feet away from the crime scene. He had taken

charge of a blue nylon rope said to be used in tying the witness during his

6

visit. IP Karunatillaka too had visited Kalyani's house for investigations and

found "evidence" that there was inhusion by outsiders.

Abeysuriya from RFP visited the crime scene and had uplifted a

finger print from a jam bottle (referred to as "C") in the "rear section of the

building" in which the body was seen. He also uplifted another print from

the almirah (referred to as "D") in the 3rd room of that house (as shown in

the photograph marked "a9". Clearly these references are made in relation

to Wasanthi's house since the official witnesses have referred to her as the

"Complainant". CI Samarajeewa noted that the body was found inside a 16

x 9 feet partitioned section of the shop which had no doors. Wasanthi's

house is located towards the back of this shop.

Thus, there was sufficient evidence before the hial Court that the

four finger prints were uplifted from two separate locations and therefore

making reference to that find as supportive of Wasanthi's version on the

sequence of events is clearly justified.

It is also clear from the evidence that Wasanthi did mention of the

robbery when she provided the 1st information to Police. This Court notes

with regret that the learned prosecutor, in leading evidence, had

appreciation of the fact that there were two separate incidents involved

and had blindly led evidence of the witnesses making repeated reference.

to the "crime scene" . It is from witness's detailed answers it could be

gathered that there were in fact two places from which two sets of

fingerprints were found during investigations.

The indictment contained only the murder charge and as the

appellant submitted there was no corresponding robbery charge even

7

though appellant's finger print was found in a jam bottle from Wasanthi's

house. The reason for leaving out of a robbery charge by the prosecution is

not known. However, that factor alone cannot assail the credibility of

Wasanthi's evidence since the evidence of the investigators as well as by

the RFP confirms that the appellant was present in her house to leave his

finger print on a jam bottle in which the witness had kept her valuables.

The bed sheet (PI) given by the witness to the appellant the night before

and its subsequent find, tied to the body of the deceased, adds to her claim

that the appellant was there in the night.

The other complaint by the appellant against the conviction is the

alleged failure to state the reasons of the trial Court in rejecting his dock

statement.

It is correct that the trial Court rejected the dock statement of the

appellant is one sentence as "unacceptable". However, the trial Court did

not stop at that point. It further considered the evidence given by witness

Wasanthi in the next paragraph. The decision to reproduce and analyse her

evidence immediately after the Court indicted its mind on the dock

statement is significant. The appellant admits having visited the deceased

in the previous evening. But he claimed that he had left his shop leaving

his merchandise there by about 4.30 or 5.00 p.m. on the same day.

In contrast, Wasanthi states that the appellant and the 1st accused was

there with the deceased until late into the night consuming liquor and

when the appellant requested bedding, having obtained two pillows and

two sheets from Kalyani, she had handed them over to him. During her

8

cross examination the appellant never suggested to her that he left by

4.30 I 5,00 p.m. that evening

Why the trial Court considered this aspect of Wasanthi's evidence at

that stage of the judgment is clearly evident when one peruses it. It was

used by the trial Court to highlight the fact that there was no challenge

during Wasanthi's evidence, when she stated that she saw him at about

9.00 p.m. that night. The request for bedding and seen late in the night

with the deceased is suificient to draw the reasonable inference that the

appellant had spent the night in the company of the deceased and

therefore his claim of leaving at 4.30 or 5.00 p.m. in the same afternoon is

clearly an afterthought brought into the dock statement by the appellant

for the first time.

When one applies the probability test also the rejection of the dock

statement is justified. The evidence is that the appellant was engaged in a

trade as a door to door salesmen carrying a stock of brooms with him

(@(;l))g,<gl~@). He had arrived at the deceased's shop with such a stock of his

merchandise. The Police have noted its presence when they visited the

crime scene. It is highly unlikely that the appellant would leave his entire

stock of merchandise with the deceased for a very long time without

coming to claim it. The date of incident is 10.08.2005 and the appellant was

arrested at Tappakotuwa Walta, Kalutara South on 13.01.2006.

The evidence is sufficient to draw the irresistible and inescapable

inference of guilt of the appellant. The reasons provided by the appeJlant

9

in his attempt to explain the finger print was rightly rejected by the trial

Court. The admitted belatedness to implicate the appellant by the

witness is explained and accepted by the trial Court.

In view of the above considerations, this Court is of the view that the

appeal of the appellant is devoid of any merit and ought to be dismissed

on that account.

The conviction and sentence of death imposed on the appellant is

hereby affirmed.

Appeal of the appellant accordingly stands dismissed.
