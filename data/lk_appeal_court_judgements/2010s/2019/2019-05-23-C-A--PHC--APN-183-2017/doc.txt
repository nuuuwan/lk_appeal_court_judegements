The Complainant-Petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to revise the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of Kandy dated 25.Q2.2016 in case No.

HC 255/2014. As per the journal entry on 21.06.2018, argument was fixed for

08.10.2018. The Learned Counsel for the accused-respondent has submitted that

oral submissions of both parties were made on 08.10.2018. On 14.12.2018, it was

again mentioned that the argument was fixed for 09.01.2019. Therefore the journal

entry on 14.12.2018 should be considered as incorrect.

Facts of the case:

The accused-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') was indicted

in the High Court ofKandy on following two counts;

1. For kidnapping one Ayesha Sewwandi, who was under 16 years from her

lawful guardian, an offence punishable under section 354 of the Penal Code.

2. For committing Grave Sexual Abuse against said Sewwandi, an offence

punishable under section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code as amended by Act

No. 29 of 1998 and Act No. 16 of 2006.

The prosecution led evidence of four witnesses including the prosecutrix and her

father. The respondent and his brother Deegala Rankothwalawwe Palitha Saman

Kularathna testified for the defence.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge acquitted the

respondent of both counts since the prosecution had failed to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt.

Being aggrieved by the said acquittal, the complainant-petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the 'petitioner') preferred this revision application.

The Learned Counsel for the respondent contended that the instant reVISIon

application has been lodged nearly two years after the judgment dated 25.02.2016

and therefore the petitioner is guilty of laches linordinate delay.

We observe that the petitioner has initially lodged an application for revision

bearing No. CA (PHC) APN 84/2016 on 01.07.2016 against the judgment dated

25.02.2016. On 20.11.2017, the Learned Counsel for the respondent raised a

preliminary objection on the maintainability of the said application. On

12.01.2018, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General informed this Court that the

Page 3 of 14

instant application in revision had been filed ~d moved that the said case bearing

No. CA (PHC) APN 84/2016 to be mentioned on another day. Both parties agreed

r to mention both cases on the same day. On 21.06.2018, the Learned DSG for the

petitioner informed Court that he was withdrawing the revision application bearing

No. CA (PHC) APN 84/2016.

Accordingly the Learned Counsel for the respondent contended that the petitioner

failed to lawfully avail himself of the statutory remedy available to him by failing

to prefer an appeal against the judgment of the High Court within the time and in

the manner prescribed by Law. We observe that the petitioner has filed the instant

application in revision on or about 26.12.2017, after a lapse of one year and 10

months. The Learned DSG has not explained reasons for such delay in filing the

previous application or this application to the satisfaction of this Court.

In the case of Seylan Bank V. Thangaveil (2004) 2 Sri L.R. 101, it was held that,

"Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking relief by way of revision,

which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which will disentitle the

petitioner to it. An application for judicial review should be made promptly

unless there are good reasons for the delay. The failure on the part of the

petitioner to explain the delay satisfactorily is by Uself fatal to I the

application. "

This position has been constantly followed by our Courts since a petitioner who

seeks a discretionary remedy should act promptly. Therefore an inordinate and

unexplained delay in seeking such relief would disentitle the petitioner to it. The

petitioner in the instant case has not explained reasons for such delay to the

satisfaction of Court. However we decide to go into merits of the instant

application since it will be in the interest of justice.

Page 4 of 14

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali. & others (1981) 2 Sri. L.R 29, it

was held that,

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the court ... "

In the case of M. Roshan Dilruk Fernando V. AG rCA (PHC) 03/2016], it was

held that,

"In the present case the Petitioner as of a right would have appealed against

the sentence on a question of law. Without exercising that right of appeal, he

opted to move Court in revision. It is settled law that the extraordinary

jurisdiction of revision can be invoked only on establishing the exceptional

circumstances. The requirement of exceptional circumstances has been held

in a series of authorities ... "

In light of above, it is understood that revisionary powers shall be exercised upon

demonstration of exceptional circumstances.

The petitioner submitted following grounds as exceptional circumstances;

1. The Learned High Court Judge has erroneously come to the conclusion that

the testimony of PW 01 was not consistent

2. No contradictions or omissions were marked when the PW 01 was being

cross examined by the defence

3. The respondent was unable to challenge the creditworthiness of the PW 01

Page 5 of 14

4. The Learned High Court Judge failed to realize all falsehood IS not

deliberate

5. There is no discrepancy between the history given to the Judicial Medical

officer and the testimony of PW 01 other than a minute discrepancy which

does not penetrate the root of the prosecution case

6. The Learned High Court Judge failed to infer the date of the offence having

scrutinized the evidence of PW 03 and the PW 07 who was the

investigating officer of the crime

7. The Learned High Court Judge failed to observe that the version of the

defence is not consistent

8. The Learned High Court Judge failed to contemplate the vital admitted

omission of the testimony of the respondent which was depicted on

proceedings of the cross examination part of the respondent

The incident relevant to the instant application is summarized as follows;

The prosecutrix (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'victim' and/or 'PW 01 ')

was 09 years old at the time of the alleged incident. She was 15 years old at the

time she testified. The prosecutrix stated that she did not remember the alleged

incident, and later said that she remembered a little of it. (Page 3 of proceedings on

09.02.2016)

As per the evidence of the prosecutrix, she was sent to a close by shop by her

mother, with an elder sister Shashi who was related to her and two younger

brothers named Malith and Shan, to buy some soap. All of them went to pick

'veralu' fruits on their way back home from the shop. The respondent came there

and dragged the prosecutrix by her hand to his house. She was wearing a t-shirt, a

skirt and underwear. The prosecutrix was put on a bed and when she attempted to

Page 6 of 14

escape the respondent removed her underwear, She sustained an injury on her head

as the respondent pushed her towards the wall. ,

The prosecutrix further stated that the respondent applied coconut oil on her vagina

and thereafter inserted his penis in her vagina. (Proceedings on 09.02.2016- page

12). However the Learned State Counsel who led the evidence in chiefhad asked a

leading question from her as to whether coconut oil was applied on her thighs, to

which she answered in affirmative.

The respondent had threatened her to death if she tried to reveal the said incident to

anyone else. Thereafter she had gone home and informed the said incident. As per

the evidence of PW 07 who was the investigating officer, the mother of the

prosecutrix has made the complaint to the Police Station, Galagedara on

19.04.2010 at 10am. Thereafter a team of police officers had visited the scene of

crime and the distance between the two houses concerned was SOm. Thereafter

they had arrested the respondent.

It was contended by the petitioner that there is no discrepancy between the history

given to the Judicial Medical officer and the testimony of PW 01 other than a

minute discrepancy which does not penetrate the root of the prosecution case.

However the petitioner has not explained what this minute discrepancy was. The

Learned Counsel for the respondent contended that the said injury on the head of

the prosecutrix does not corroborate her evidence at the trial.

Dr Nimal Jayawardena (PW ll-Judicial Medical Officer) had examined the victim

at the District Hospital of Galagedara at 8pm on 19.04.2010. He testified that there

was a contusion about 3cm, behind the ear of victim. The JMO had further

explained that such an injury remains for a few days and gradually turns from red

to black in colour. However the injury on the prosecutrix's head was bright red.

Page 7 of 14

Therefore the JMO expressed his opinion as to. the injury must have been sustained

within 24 hours prior to the examination. We observe that the JMO had examined , the prosecutrix after 27 and half hours from the alleged incident.

The Learned Counsel for the respondent further contended that there had been no

abrasion or any remarkable injury in thighs or vagina of the prosecutrix and the

JMO had not been able to find out whether coconut oil had been applied. However

we are mindful that the Legislature of Sri Lanka by bringing in an amendment (Act

No. 22 of 1995) has clarified that evidence of physical injuries to the body is not

essential to prove that sexual intercourse took place without consent. Even the

JMO testified that the victim had a wash by the time he examined her. Therefore

the said contention of the Learned Counsel is untenable. However at the same time,

it is quite unsafe to stand on a sole testimony of a victim if that appears to be

fabricated.

In Sunil and another V. The Attorney General (1986) 1 Sri L.R 230, it was held

that,

"It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could

be acted on even in the absence of corroboration ... "

In the case of Premasiri V. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R 106, Justice E.

Basnayake observed that,

"The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of corroboration as a matter

of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to dispense with

it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath Biswas vs.

State(6). In Sunil and another vs. the Attorney - General Dheeraratne J.

Page 8 of 14

with H. A. G. De Silva and Ramana!han JJ agreeing held that "if the

evidence of the complainant is so convincing, they could act on that

evidence alone, even in the absence of her evidence being corroborated".

(Emphasis added)

Justice Eric Basnayake further cited the case of Rex V. Manning (1969) 53 Cr

Appl. R 15, in which it was held that,

"In cases of sexual offences it is really dangerous to convict on the evidence

of the woman or girl alone. This is dangerous because human experience

has shown that in these courts girls and women do sometimes tell an entirely

false story which is very easy to fabricate, but extremely difficult to refute. "

In Premasiri V. The Queen [77 N.L.R 86] it was held that,

"In a charge of rape it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as

to convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth ... "

In light of above it is understood that a Judge should not act upon a sole testimony

of a victim unless the Judge is completely satisfied that the victim is speaking the

truth. We observe that the PW 01 has remained silent for most of the questions put

forth by both Counsel for the prosecution and the defence. We find that the

Learned Counsel, who appeared for the respondent in the High Court, has drawn

the attention of Court to a contradiction in the statement made to the Police by the

prosecutrix even though such contradiction was not marked. (Proceedings at

11.15am on 09.02.2016)

As per the evidence of the father of the prosecutrix (PW 03), he was not at home

when the incident said to have been occurred and he got to know about it only

Page 9 of 14

when he went to the Police Station with his sister and wife. As per the said witness

he did not inquire from his daughter about it and she never told him as to what , happened to her on that day. The PW 01 has testified that her father was at home

when she went with other children. However the PW 03, father of the PW 01

testified that he was not at home when his daughter went to the shop. Relevant

portion of evidence is reproduced as follows;

PW 03 - Cross-Examination

G3'-'l ~!)Dl" (Proceedings at llam on 10.02.2016)

Further PW 03 testified that he was not present when the respondent was arrested

or he did not see whether Police officers visited the scene of crime (Page 36 of the

Page 10 of 14

brief). However the PW 07, the investigating pfficer, testified that the father of the

prosecutrix was present when they investigated the scene of crime and he was , present when the respondent was arrested as well (Proceedings on 10.02.2010 -

page 03 & page 09). Even though these contradictions do not affect the root of the

prosecution case, it affects the creditworthiness of such witness.

The Learned DSG for the petitioner contended that the Learned High Court Judge

erred in requiring the prosecution to lead the evidence of the other children who

were present at the time when the respondent dragged the victim by her hand. It is

well settled law that the prosecution need not call a specific number of witnesses to

prove a case against an accused.

In Sumanasena V. Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R 137, it was held that,

"Evidence- must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of

I " aw ...

It is understood that evidence given by one witness is sufficient if the Judge can be

satisfied about the quality of such evidence. The Learned High Court has held as

follows;

" ... <fl '" ~ ~ts:>2S'! 2S) 0 B 0 e-cl <fl '" U e 5 2Sf?53 2S) ~ <fl C( e-CD251 "'251 5 C) itt '" ~ co

Accordingly we observe that the Learned High Court Judge was not stressing on

the number of witness but about the weight of the evidence.

The version of the defence was that the allegation had been made against him

because the victim's grandmother was angry with the family of the respondent.

The PW 03 admitted that his mother had a land dispute with the respondent's

brother. The respondent constantly denied the allegation leveled against him and

testified that this was fabricated against him.

In the case of Yodhasinghegedara Chandrasoma V. Attorney General (CA

87/2008 - Decided On 15.07.2015), it was held that,

"Learned Counsel submitted that the evidence of Dr. Gajanayake who

examined the victim and the evidence of Sumanawathi, mother of the victim

cannot be considered as corroboration and in the absence of any other

evidence to corroborate the victim, it is unsafe to act only on the

uncorroborated testimony of the victim.

In the case of Gurcharen Sing Vs. State of Haryana AIR (1972) SC 2661

Indian Supreme Court held thus; as a rule of prudence however, court

normally looks for some corroboration on her testimony so as to satisfy its

conscience that she is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape

on her has not been falsely implicated.

In contrary the Indian Supreme Court in Bhoginbhai Harjibhoie Vs. State

of Gujarat (1983) AIR SC 753 held "in the Indian setting, refusal to act on

Page 12 of 14

the testimony of a victim of sexual assau)t in the absence of corroboration as

a rule is adding insult to the injury. "

r

When there is strong uncontradicted evidence and in the absence of any

strong reason for falsely implicating the accused, in such a situation our

courts preferred to follow the later ... " (Emphasis added)

In the case of Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [S.C.

Appeal No: 79/2008 - Decided on 06.05.2010], it was held that,

"Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions (Vide, Dashiraj v. the State AIR (1964) Tri. 54). When

contradictions are marked, the judge should direct his attention to whether

they are material or not and the witness should be given the opportunity of

explaining that matter (Vide, State of UP v. Anthony AIR 1985 SC 48; A. G.

v. Visuvalingam 47 NLR 286). It is dangerous to presume or assume that

because two witnesses contradict each other, one of them must be a false

witness and reject the testimony in its entirety. The judge has a duty to probe

into whether the discrepancy occurred due to a lack of observation or

defective memory or a dishonest motive (Vide, Colin Thom'e J In

Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena 19842 Sri LLR 397).

In State of UP v. Anthony the Indian Supreme Court stated that 'while

appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the

evidence ... read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth'. The Court went

on to elaborate further that 'Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper technical approach by taking sentences

torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to

some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the

Page 13 of 14

..

root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a

h I , " w o e ...

We are mindful of the fact that it is the Learned Trial Judge who has the benefit of

assessing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses before her. We observe

that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses have few contradictions; both per se

and inter se. Therefore we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge came

to the correct conclusion that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt. Further we consider the undue delay on the part of the petitioner

in filing this revision application as well.

Considering above, we are of the view that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of this Court to invoke the revisionary

powers. We see .. no irregularity or failure of justice in the judgment of the Learned

High Court Judge of Kandy dated 25.02.2016 in case No. HC 255/2014 and

therefore we affirm the same.

Accordingly the revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
