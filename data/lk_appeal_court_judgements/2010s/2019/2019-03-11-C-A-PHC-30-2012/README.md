This is an appeal from an order dated 20.04.2012 made by the learned High Court judge of the

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle although mistakenly the pt Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant (Appellant) states it to be an application in revision.

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) filed an application under section

66(1){b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act) in the Magistrate's Court of Ruwanwella on

27.07.2007 against the 1st Appellant and five others. The Respondent stated that he was in

possession of a one-acre portion of land which was part of a larger land identified as

25)lC)l~a3251"@251" e525)a~",. According to the Respondent, when he entered the said portion of the

land to pluck coconuts on 04.07.2007, the pt Appellant and five others had already entered the

land and started constructing a house on the land. Upon inquiry by the Respondent, the pt

Appellant and five others had allegedly threatened him and chased him away from the land.

The 1st Appellant has taken up the position that he has been in continuous possession of the

said portion of the land from 23.07.2003.

The Respondent's private plaint had also made reference to the fact that a writ application

(HC/Kegalle/No 3084/W) was filed by the Respondent seeking to quash a decision by the

Divisional Secretariat Yatiyanthota, to put up notices on the land asking any party to show cause

why a permit granted in relation to the land should not be cancelled.

The learned Magistrate by order dated 16.05.2008 dismissed the action on the basis that the

Primary Court had no jurisdiction to go into a matter concerning state land (Vide page 106 of

the Appeal Brief). The Respondent filed a revision application against the said order and the

learned High Court Judge revised the learned Magistrate's order and directed him to inquire

into the matter in terms of section 68(3) of the Act (Vide page 116 of the Appeal Brief).

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate inquired into the matter and by order dated 22.03.2011

determined that the Respondent had been dispossessed from the land by the 1st Appellant and

five others two months prior to the date of filing information (Vide page 294 of the Appeal

Brief). The Appellant filed a revision application (HCR No. 4104) against the said order seeking

Page 4 of 13

to have it set aside on the basis that the learned Magistrate had failed to consider and evaluate

evidence on record which showed that the 1st Appellant was in continuous possession of the

corpus from the year 2003.

The learned High Court Judge by order dated 20.04.2012 concluded that there were no

exceptional circumstances to disturb the findings of the learned Magistrate (Vide page 38 of

the Appeal Brief). Hence this appeal against the said order.

Before considering the substantive grounds canvassed in the present appeal it is necessary to

consider a preliminary objection raised by learned counsel for the Respondent against the

maintainability of this appeal.

Non-compliance with Rule 4(2) of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from High

Courts established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules of 1988

The Respondent submitted that the petition of appeal is defective as it does not ex facie comply

with the requirements stipulated in Rule 4(2) of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for appeals

from High Courts established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules. The Appellant argues

that the said preliminary objections has been raised belatedly and should be disregarded by this

court.

It is trite law that an objection to the jurisdiction of a court must be raised by a party at the

earliest available opportunity, unless the jurisdictional objection impugns a patent lack of

jurisdiction. This position is best illustrated by an observation made by Soza J in

Navaratnasingham vs. Arumugam [(1980) 2 Sri. L. R. 1]:

"Where a matter is within the plenary jurisdiction of the Court, if no objection is taken,

the Court will then have jurisdiction to proceed and make a valid order. In the present

case, the objection to jurisdiction was raised for the first time when the matter was being

argued in the Court of Appeal and the objection had not even been taken in the petition

filed before that Court" (emphasis added)

Page 5 of 13

In Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd vs. T. W Roberts (56 N.L.R. 293) Sansoni J, quoted with approval the

following passage from Spencer Bower on Estoppel by Representation (1923) at page 187 to

illustrate the difference between a patent and latent lack of jurisdiction:

"Where it is merely a question of irregularity of procedure, or of a defect in contingent'

jurisdiction, or non-compliance with statutory conditions precedent to the validity of a

step in the litigation, of such a character that, if one of the parties be allowed to waive,

or by conduct or inaction to estop himself from setting up, such irregularity or want of'

contingent' jurisdiction or non-compliance, no new jurisdiction is thereby impliedly

created, and no existing jurisdiction is thereby impliedly extended beyond its existing

boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained, and the affirmative answer of illegality will

fail, for, the Royal prerogative not being invaded" (emphasis added)

In Beatrice Perera vs. The Commissioner of National Housing (77 N.L.R. 361) the court made the

following observation:

"Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over the

cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to

comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of power by

the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the first mentioned of these is commonly known

in the law as a ' patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the

second a ' latent' or ' contingent' want of jurisdiction or a defectus triationis." (emphasis

added)

Accordingly, I hold that the jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent impugns a latent

lack of jurisdiction on the part of this court. The side note to Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal

(Procedure for Appeals from High Courts established by Article 154 P of the Constitution) Rules

reads as 'What Petition of Appeal shall state'. Therefore, the said rule clearly deals with a

procedural requirement that is necessary for the exercise of powers by the Court of Appeal. An

objection pertaining to such latent or contingent want of jurisdiction must be raised at the

earliest available opportunity by the party relying on it.

Page 6 of 13

In the matter before us, the petition of appeal against the learned High Court judge's order was

lodged in the High Court on 23.04.2012. The High Court minutes for this date indicate that the

Appellant had dispatched the petition of appeal by registered post to the Respondent (Vide page

23 of the Appeal Brief). Subsequently, the Respondent received formal notice of the application

and was asked to be present in court on 06.09.2012.

Accordingly, it is reasonable to presume that the Respondent would have had knowledge of the

purported defect in the petition of appeal by this point of time. The journal entries indicate that

the counsel for the Respondent did not raise the preliminary objection on this date. The

preliminary objection was raised almost six years after this date on 14.03.2018. During this

period, the case was re-fixed for argument on five separate occasions. The Respondent did not

raise the preliminary objection at any time during this period.

H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth in Administrative Law 9th Ed, Page 464 makes the following

observation;

liThe court normally insists that the objection shall be taken as soon as the party

prejudiced knows the facts which entitle him to object. If, after he or his advisers know

of the disqualification, they let the proceedings continue without protest, they are held

to have waived their objection and the determination cannot be challenged." (emphasis

added)

Halsbury's Laws of England, 5th Ed, Vol 19 reads:

"An application to challenge the jurisdiction of the court must be made at the outset of

the proceedings, for if the defendant takes any step in the proceedings other than a step

to challenge the jurisdiction, he will be taken to have waived any opportunity for

challenge which he might otherwise have had, and to have submitted to the jurisdiction

of the court." (emphasis added)

The Respondent's conduct viz. allowing proceedings before this court to continue without

promptly raising the preliminary objection, clearly manifests an intention on his part to waive the

right to make the said preliminary objection. In Abeywickrema vs. Pathirana and others [(1986)

1 Sri L R 120, 152] it was observed that a waiver must be an intentional act with knowledge. It

necessarily implies knowledge of one's rights vis a vis the other party's infraction and an election

Page 7 of 13

to abandon those rights. An election to waive a right can be inferred by conduct. (Fernando vs.

Samaraweera 52 N.L.R. 278).

In the present matter, there are sufficient grounds for me to conclude that the Respondent has

waived his right to raise the preliminary objection by letting the proceedings continue without

promptly raising it. Therefore, I hold that the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent

ought to be overruled.

The substantive grounds of appeal

The main contentions of the Appellant are that;

a) the learned High Court had failed to consider the points of fact and law canvassed by the

Appellant in the revision application to show that he - and not the Respondent - was in

possession of the land two months prior to the filing of the information

b) the learned High Court judge had disregarded the fact that the learned Magistrate had

failed to record whether a breach of peace is threatened or likely

c) the learned High Court judge had disregarded the fact that the learned Magistrate had

failed to induce the parties to arrive at a settlement

d) the order of the learned High Court judge is erroneous as its final conclusion does not

accord with the reasoning made by the judge in the same order

It would be appropriate at this stage to first consider (b) and (c) viz. whether the learned High

Court judge has disregarded and if so whether he was justified in disregarding the said two

contentions raised by the Appellant.

Page 8 of 13

Breach of Peace

A perusal of the learned High Court Judge's order clearly shows that the judge had taken

cognizance of and satisfied himself about the correctness of the procedure adopted by the

Magistrate in coming to a finding that a breach of peace was likely in the future (Vide page 37

of the Appeal Brief) The order of the learned Magistrate indicates that he had satisfied himself

about the existence of a likelihood of a breach of peace and thereafter caused notices to be

affixed on the disputed land (Vide page 289 of the Appeal Brief).

The Appellant contends that this procedure is irregular as there is no record of the Magistrate's

finding that a breach of peace was likely. In Navaratnasingham vs. Arumugam [(1980) 2 Sri LR

1] a similar objection was taken viz. that it was necessary for a Magistrate to make an order in

writing stating his grounds for being satisfied that a breach of peace was likely.

The court rejected this contention and held as follows:

" ... all that is necessary is that the Magistrate himself must be satisfied on the material

on record that there is a present fear that there will be a breach of the peace stemming

from the dispute unless proceedings are taken under the section."

In CA (PHC) 161/98 (C.A.M 21.06.2010) it was held that the failure of the Primary Court Judge to

explicitly state in the proceedings that the he has come to a conclusion that a breach of peace

was likely does not deprive him of jurisdiction. This court utilized section 114{f) of the Evidence

Ordinance to hold that one is entitled to presume that a Primary Court judge has satisfied himself

that there's a breach of peace when the affidavit and information filed by the parties had material

to show that a breach of peace was threatened or likely.

I hold that in the present matter there was sufficient information in the private plaint for the

Magistrate to conclude that a breach of peace was likely. The failure ofthe Magistrate to explicitly

record this fact does not deprive him of jurisdiction. Therefore, the learned High Court judge was

correct in disregarding that ground of revision.

Page 9 of 13

Failure to Explore Settlement

The Appellant also contended that the High Court judge had disregarded the fact that the learned

Magistrate had failed to induce the parties to arrive at a settlement in terms of section 66(6) of

the Act. It therefore needs to be considered whether the learned High Court judge was bound to

consider this contention at the revisionary stage.

In Mohamed Nizam vs. Justin Dias [C A. PHC 16/2007] two judges of this court held that the

question of non-compliance of section 66(6) of the Act by the judge of the Primary Court cannot

be raised belatedly at the stage of revision or appeal and inaction of the party by not raising the

objection in the Primary Court amounts to waiver of such objection. This was quoted with

approval and followed in De Silva vs. Seneviratne [C.A.(PHC) 29/2006 (HC), C.A.M. 10.03.2014].

In Jayantha Gunasekara vs. Jayatissa Gunasekara and Others [(2011) 1 Sri LR 284, 303] a

Divisional Bench of this court observed that inaction in the Primary Court would include the

failure to raise the learned Magistrate's non-compliance with section 66(6) before the learned

Magistrate commenced the inquiry.

In the matter before us, the learned Magistrate initially made an order on 16.05.2008 dismissing

the matter without holding an inquiry. This was because the learned Magistrate was of the

opinion that he had no jurisdiction to make a section 66 order when it came to state land.

Admittedly, the written submissions of the Appellant which were filed before the said order was

made raised an objection based on non-compliance with section 66(6) of the Act (Vide page 131

of the Appeal Brief).

Thus, the objection was not raised belatedly. Therefore, under normal circumstances the learned

High Court judge ought to have taken account of that objection. However, what has transpired

in the present matter is that the order of the Magistrate dated 16.05.2008 was revised by the

High Court judge of Kegalle in HCR No 3425 by order dated 2010.11.02. In the latter order, the

High Court judge has made a specific direction under section 6(a) of the High Court of the

Provinces Act of 1990 to take cognizance of the affidavits and documents filed and make an order

in terms of section 68(3) of the Act. Section 68(3) of Act is a provision which allows a Magistrate

to make an order after an inquiry has been commenced.

Page 10 of 13

Therefore, the directions given by the High Court judge in the exercise of that court's revisionary

jurisdiction, vested the Magistrate with jurisdiction to inquire into the matter and make an

appropriate order, although a settlement had not been attempted in terms of section 66(6} of

the Act. Therefore, the High Court judge in HCR No 4104 was justified in disregarding the

Appellant's contention that the learned Magistrate had failed to induce the parties to arrive at a

settlement before making his order.

Failure to Consider Points 0/ Fact and Law

The main contention of the Appellant is that the High Court had failed to consider the points of

fact and law canvassed by the Appellant in the revision application to show that he - and not the

Respondent - was in possession of the land two months prior to the filing of the information.

When a contention of this nature is raised, it is important to bear in mind the principle that the

right of appeal granted under Article 154P(3}(b} of the Constitution is a right to challenge the

judgment of the High Court exercising revisionary powers and not to impugn the Primary Court

judge's order by way of an appeal [Jayantha Gunasekera vs. Jayatissa Gunasekera and others

(supra)]. The appeal in the strict sense is not one against the determination of the judge of the

Primary Court but against the judgment of the High Court exercising revisionary powers. [See

also Case No. CA(PHC} 85/2007, C.A.M 07.12.2018]. Thus, what is at issue before us is the

propriety of the revisionary order.

A perusal of the learned Magistrate's order shows that there has been a careful and

comprehensive evaluation of the respective documents produced by both parties to determine

who had the stronger claim to having possessed the corpus two months prior to the filing of

information. The learned Magistrate has ultimately relied on documents made in the ordinary

course of business viz. receipts recording monthly payments made to the Respondent by the

Kithulgala Smallholders Tea Development Board to make use of a building on the land, to

conclude that the Respondent was in possession of the property two months prior to the filing

of information (Vide page 293 of the Appeal Brief).

Page 11 of 13

,

It is relevant to note that section 32(2) of the Evidence Ordinance attaches probative value to

such documents made in the ordinary course of business. These include acknowledgment written

or signed indicating the receipt of money, goods, securities, or property of any kind. Thus, the

learned Magistrate was justified in relying on the said documents to satisfy himself about the

possession of the Respondent. Therefore, I find no reason to conclude that the learned High

Court judge misconceived himself either in law or fact in associating himself with the findings of

the learned Magistrate.

The last contention that has been taken up by the Appellant is that the order of the learned High

Court judge is erroneous as its final conclusion does not accord with the reasoning made in the

same order. Indeed, a perusal of the order reveals the learned High Court judge at one point

stating that the petitioner before the High Court was in possession of the land two months

preceding the filing of information (Vide page 37 of the Appeal Brief).

Nevertheless, the order concludes by stating that the learned Magistrate was correct in holding

that the petitioner-respondent was in possession of the land. This discrepancy arises due to a

misapprehension by the learned High Court judge. The learned judge had mistaken the petitioner

before the High Court to be the petitioner before the primary court viz. Senanayake

Mudiyanselage Lalith Gunasili Senanayake (Vide page 36 of the Appeal Brief). However,

Senanayake Mudiyanselage Lalith Gunasili Senanayake was the Respondent before the High

Court. It is solely based on this misapprehension that the 'petitioner before the High Court' is

held to have been in possession of the land two months prior to the filing of information. As the

final paragraph of the order shows, the learned High Court judge meant to confirm the

Magistrates Courts conclusion that Senanayake Mudiyanselage Lalith Gunasili Senanayake viz.

the Respondent was in possession of the land two months preceding the filing of information.

The proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any

court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. [Victor and

another vs. Cyril De Silva (1998) 1 SrLL.R. 41; Gunasena vs. Kandage and others (1997) 3 Sri.L.R.

393].

Page 12 of 13

" ,

I am of the opinion that this principle must be applied in the instant matter to preserve the

learned High Court judge's order despite the defect in identifying the respective parties. In order

to clearly set out that pOSition I vary the order of the learned High Court Judge to read as

confirming the Magistrates Court's conclusion that Senanayake Mudiyanselage Lalith Gunasili

Senanayake viz. the Respondent was in possession of the land two months preceding the filing

of information.

For the aforesaid reasons and subject to the variation made above, I see no reason to interfere

with the order dated 20.04.2012 made by the learned High Court judge of the Sabaragamuwa

Province holden in Kegalle.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
