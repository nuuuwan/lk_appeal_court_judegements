The Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner filed this revision application seeking to set

aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of

Western Province holden in Negombo dated 14.06.2018 in Case No. HCRA

553/2017 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned

Magistrate of Negombo dated 23.10.2017 in Case No. L/24280. At the stage of

argument, both parties agreed to dispose this case by way of written submissions

and to abide by the same.

Facts of the case:

The accused-driver was arrested on or about 27.11.2010 with vehicle bearing No.

42 Shri 1683 for illegally transporting timber. The driver was charged before the

Learned Magistrate of Negombo and the driver pleaded guilty to the charge.

Page 3 of 9

Accordingly, the Learned Magistrate convict~d him and imposed a fine of Rs.l 0,

000/= and thereafter held a vehicle inquiry with regard to the vehicle in question.

The respondent-petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioner')

testified in the said inquiry. The Learned Magistrate confiscated the lorry by the

order dated 23.10.2017 since the petitioner failed to prove . that he took all

precautions to prevent an offence being committed utilizing his vehicle.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court of Negombo and~he Learned High Court

Judge dismissed the revision application due to defective prayer in the petition and

affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner filed this revision application.

The following grounds of revision were averred on behalf of the petitioner;

1. The lorry is the sole source of income of the petitioner and he is the sole

breadwinner of the family

2. Since the appellate Court was satisfied that the petitioner had taken all

precautions to prevent the commission of an offence, the only matter for

consideration is the correction of the error in his prayer.

It is submitted by the Learned Counsel for the petitioner that the Learned High

Court Judge was also satisfied that the petitioner had taken sufficient precautions

to prevent the commission of an offence but stopped short of granting relief

because of the lorry number in the prayer of petition. I observe that in the prayer of

the petition submitted to the High Court, the lorry number was mentioned as '226-

5618' instead of '42 Shri 1683' which was the subject matter of this application.

Further the date of the order was mentioned as '02.05.2013' instead of23.10.2017.

The Learned High Court Judge in his order held that even though there were

Page 4 of9

sufficient evidence to prove that the petition~r took all precautions to prevent an

offence being committed utilizing the vehicle bearing No. 42 Shri 1683, there was

no such evidence available with regard to the vehicle mentioned in the prayer.

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision application.

Subsequent to the dismissal, the Attorney at Law of the petitioner submitted a

petition dated 12.09.2018, to the High Court, praying for the correction of error in

the prayer. The Learned High Court Judge refused the said application.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that-J:he Learned High Court

Judge failed to address the submission that lorry No. 226-5618 was inadvertently

typed in the prayer. It was submitted thatlorry no. 226-5618 did not feature at any

time during the proceedings in both the Magistrate's Court and the Provincial High

Court except in the prayer and it added to the credence that the wrong lorry number

was inserted by an inadvertence. It was further submitted by the Counsel that the

source of the inadvertence was due to the practice of 'cutting and pasting' ill

Microsoft Word when drafting of pleadings are done.

I find this submission to be quite unreasonable and inappropriate. In the case of

Illangakoon Mudiyanselage Gnanathilaka Illangakoon V. Anuia Kumarihami

(S.C .H.C.C.A.LA 27712011) (SC minutes of 05.04.2013) [as followed in CA.

Case No.l118/1999 (F)], it was observed that,

''] must emphasize thai when accepting any professional matter from a

client, it shall be the duty of any attorney at law to exercise his skill with due

diligence in drafting the necessary papers with due regard to its duty to

Court and to the client. /I

Page 5 of 9

In the case of Surangi V. Rodrigo (2003) 3 S,ri L.R 35, it was held that,

"No court is entitled to or has jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a party which

are not prayed for in the prayer to the plaint ... "

In the case of Fer nan do V. Sybil Fernando (1997) 3 Sri L.R 01, it was held that,

"There is the substantive law and there is the procedural law. Procedural law

is not secondary: The two branches are complementary. The maxim ubi i~s, ibi

remedium reflects the complementary character of civil procedure law. The two

'~ branches are also interdependent. Halsbury (ibid.) points out that the interplay

between the two branches often conceals what is substantive and what lS

procedural. It is by procedure that the law is put into motion, and it IS

procedural law which puts life into substantive law, gives its remedy and

effectiveness and brings it into being. .. " "

An Attorney at Law who holds a twofold duty towards his client and the Court,

should not in any instance act in a reckless manner that would inevitably

jeopardize his client. I am of the view ~ that an Attorney at Law must be very

cautious in the process of drafting a petition which involves procedural law. Even a

slightest mistake on such petition would cost a client his whole case and of course

an Attorney cannot be excused for the same. I observe that a defective prayer was

submitted due to pure rec~essness on the part of the person who drafted the

petition and it cannot be simplified by any excuse. I wish to express my

disapproval on this position. The Counsel and the Attorneys at Law should not be

encouraged to expect that the Judges are always expected to rectify errors

committed by them. I am of the view that at least the Counsel who appeared for the

petitioner in the High Court would have realized these defects in the prayer if he

was cautious enough to peruse the petition and such error could have been easily

Page 6 of 9

rectified during the argument stage by amen.ding the petition. However none of

them failed to realize the mistake until the Learned High Court Judge came across

, the defective prayer and dismissed the petition due to the same. The Learned

Counsel for the petitioner submitted the case of Abeypala V. Abeyakirthi (1981)

1 Sri L.R 86, in which Ismail, J granted relief upon being satisfied that there was a

typographical error in the prayer. I am well aware that a court should not be

fettered by technical objections based on matters of procedure and/or a defect in a

petition of appeal will not fetter the jurisdiction of Court. [vide Colgan and

" "-. Others V. Udeshi and Others (1996) 2 Sri LR. 220; Podihamy V. Seimon

Appu 47 NLR 503]. However in the instant case, I observe that even though the

body of the petition refers to the lorry bearing No. 42 Shri 1683, the whole prayer

refers to an order dated 02.05.2013 and a vehicle bearing No. 226-5618 which do

not exist in the instant case.

At this juncture, I observe that the Learned High Court Judge m his order

mentioned that there were enough reasons to interfere with the order of the

Learned Magistrate if not for the defectIve prayer. However I observe that the

petitioner has failed to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances in order to

revise the order of the Learned Magistrate. It is trite law that revisionary powers of

this Court shall be exercised only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

Page 7 of 9

revisionary jurisdiction of this court wiU become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

c appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal ... "

In the case of W.M.F.G. Fernando V. Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.II08/99 (F)], it was held that,

"It is trite law that the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory in ..........

nature, and that the object is the proper administration of justice. In

Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice

and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a party who is entitled to it, may claim to have as

of right, and its object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order

, of court which is tainted by error . .. o /~'

In light of above, it is understood that the purpose of revisionary powers is to

correct any errors, irregularities or illegalities in lower court orders. I observe that

the Learned Magistrate had evaluated all the evidence placed before her and made

an order well within law. Therefore, I am of the view that the Learned High Court

Judge erred in stating that there were enough reasons to interfere with the order of

the Learned Magistrate if not for the defective prayer. I am of the view that the

petition should not have been dismissed only on the ground of defective prayer but

for the non-existence of exceptional circumstances as well. Since the final outcome

was the dismissal of the petition, I do not wish to interfere with the order of the

Learned High Court Judge other than expressing my view on the matter of

Page 8 of 9

exceptional circumstances. Therefore this application should stand dismissed due

to non-existence of exceptional circumstances. I affirm the order of the Learned

Magistrate ofNegombo dated 23.10.2017 in Case No. L/24280.

Accordingly the revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
