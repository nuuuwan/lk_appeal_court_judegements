Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner Bank filed this application against the

Commissioner General of Labour seeking to quash the decisions

marked P18 and P19 whereby the Petitioner was directed to pay

the 4th Respondent, a former employee of the Bank, an

enhanced gratuity of one months salary (instead of a months

salary) for each year of service as per P7, which is an internal

memorandum of the Bank.

Whilst the 4th Respondent was serving as a Senior Manager of

the Bank, he was, according to pages 8-10 of P3, caught red-

handed by the CID for facilitating a serious fraudulent act of

forging Bank Statements inter alia by providing Bank

Letterheads and Bank Statements for financial benefits in order

to facilitate third parties to obtain Visa from the British High

Commission. He was arrested and produced before the

Magistrate.

The 4th Respondents services were terminated by the Bank by

P4, which reads as follows:

You have been arrested by the Criminal Investigation

Department and produced before the Hon. Magistrate of

Fort when you were handing over certain documents and

details belonging to the Bank to a third party in order to

prepare forged documents.

As a Senior Manager of the Bank, your above conduct is a

gross violation of the rules and regulations of the Bank.

Further, you have aided and abetted a fraud and you have

3

committed a serious offence by allowing a third party to use

Bank documents for the said fraud.

Your said act has brought disrepute to the Bank and in the

circumstances your said conduct is unbecoming of an

employee of the Bank.

Therefore the Management has decided to terminate your

employment with the Bank with immediate effect.

The 4th Respondent did not challenge this decision to terminate

his services.

Instead, the 4th Respondent, by P5 addressed to the Chairman of

the Bank, whilst admitting guilt for what he did, sought mercy

to convert termination of services to resignation from service. In

that letter, the 4th Respondent has inter alia stated that: I

concede that it is I, and I alone who is responsible for my

unfortunate fate. Looking back, even I cannot comprehend how

and why that I acted with such indiscretion. This request of the

4th Respondent has been rejected by the Bank.

It is thereafter, the 4th Respondent has sent P6 to the

Commissioner of Labour seeking several reliefs including one

months salary (instead of a months salary) for each year of

service as gratuity.

The demand of one months salary for each year of service as

gratuity is based on P7, which says, The Board of Directors (of

the Bank) has approved in principle increased gratuity payments

for staff who have completed 10 years of unblemished service in

the Bank.

According to P13, the 4th Respondent has later been discharged

by the Magistrates Court from criminal proceedings on the

instructions of the Attorney-General.

Let me now have a look at the reasons adduced by the

Commissioner of Labour in arriving at the decision contained in

P19. They are:

a) the act of discharge of the 4th Respondent from criminal

proceedings;

b) no other evidence being presented at the inquiry to show

bad service record of the 4th respondent;

c) notwithstanding his services have been terminated on

preparation of fraudulent documents using Bank material,

the damage caused to the Bank has not been shown to

forfeit or reduce gratuity in terms of section 13 of the

Payment of Gratuity Act;

d) other employees who left the service during the relevant

period were granted enhanced gratuity.

The Commissioner of Labour has predominantly granted the

relief to the 4th Respondent on the basis of the said discharge

from the criminal proceedings. By looking at P13 nobody knows

on what basis the Magistrate was instructed by the Attorney

General to discharge the 4th Respondent.

All the officers who have completed over 10 years of service are

not entitled to enhanced gratuity. According to P7, only the

officers who have 10 years of unblemished service in the Bank

5

are eligible to enhanced gratuity. Discharging the 4th

Respondent on the Attorney Generals advice does not, in my

view, make him an officer having 10 years of unblemished

service in the Bank. Unblemished service cannot be equalized

to non-conviction for a crime.

The 4th Respondent never contested the contents and the

decision contained in P4, which is the Letter of Termination. By

P5, he acknowledged receipt of P4 and has indirectly, if not

directly, admitted the guilt. Hence there was no necessity to

adduce further evidence before the Commissioner of Labour to

say that he was disentitled to enhanced gratuity. There was no

necessity even to have a domestic inquiry.

Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act refers to gratuity

payable under the Act and not payable above that limit at the

discretion of the employer.

The fact that other unknown employees who left the service

during the relevant period were granted enhanced gratuity is

beside the point as the services of other employees were not

terminated on charges of fraud as seen from P4.

Although the present matter in issue is not in relation to the

dismissal from service, but in relation to the payment of

enhanced gratuity, the Judgment of Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva

in Bank of Ceylon v. Manivasagasivam [1995] 2 Sri LR 79 will

throw some light on resolving the matter. Whilst setting aside

the Judgment of the High Court, which reversed the order of the

Labour Tribunal and directed reinstatement of a Bank officer,

His Lordship at page 83 stated thus:

6

The High Court has failed to address its mind to a

significant fact, namely, the kind of institution in which the

applicant was employed. As observed by Siva Selliah, J. in

Sithamparanathan v. Peoples Bank [1986] 1 Sri LR 411 at

414-415, "It is needless to emphasize that the utmost

confidence is expected of any officer employed in a

Bank...he owes a duty both to the Bank to preserve its fair

name and integrity and to the customer whose money lies

in deposit with the Bank. Integrity and confidence thus are

indispensable and where an officer has forfeited such

confidence has been shown up as being involved in any

fraudulent or questionable transaction, both public interest

and the interest of the Bank demand that he should be

removed from such confidence."

It seems to be that by reason of the part played by the

applicant in two transactions which, to say the least, were

questionable, he has clearly forfeited the confidence

reposed in him as an employee of the Bank. In these

circumstances, the Bank should not and cannot continue to

employ him.

That means, more than other employees, a Bank employee falls

into a special category in terms of integrity and confidence, and

where such an employee involves even in a questionable

transaction as opposed to a prima facie fraudulent transaction,

he is not fit to be a Bank employee.

The case at hand is not a case the employer Bank denies

payment of gratuity which the 4th Respondent employee is

7

statutorily entitled to claim. The question relates to the

entitlement of the enhanced part of gratuity in accordance with

P7 whereby, if I may repeat, the staff officers who have

completed unblemished service in the Bank are eligible to

receive. I must also emphasize that this claim is made by the

employee not after retirement or resignation from faithful

service, but after dismissal, which was not contested by the

employee as he was entitled to do. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, the 4th Respondent does not have

unblemished service.

An employee cannot, in my view, claim, as of right, that he is

entitled to enhanced gratuity, or gratuity in excess of the normal

gratuity payable under the Payment of Gratuity Act. That does

not mean that the employee is at the mercy of the employer

when it comes to enhanced gratuity, or the employer can

wantonly and arbitrarily deny the fruits of the enhanced gratuity

scheme put in place, of which the other employees, similarly

circumstanced, are beneficiaries. The employers decision or

rather discretion, as one might call it, can be challenged before

the correct forum. In modern law the concept of absolute

discretion is unacceptable. However, in the instant case, the

Petitioner employer has not acted arbitrarily or unfairly when it

denied enhanced gratuity to the employee.

I unhesitatingly quash the impugned orders of the

Commissioner of Labour marked P18 and P19 by certiorari.

However I make no order as to costs.
