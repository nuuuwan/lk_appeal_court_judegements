M. M. Abdul Gaffoor, J.

The original Plaintiff had instituted this partition action against the

Defendants above named seeking to partition the land called

Kongahawatte alias Millagahawatte containing in extent of about

3 Acres.

The Defendants have filed their respective statements of claims

before the Trial Court denying the identity of the corpus and the

pedigree and they have also claimed that partition of a separate land

too had been surveyed at the Preliminary Survey. Therefore, they

have sought an exclusion of the said land from the corpus.

After the preliminary steps were concluded and the case was fixed for

trial, the 1A, 2, 9, 32 and 33 Defendant-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellants) have failed to appear before the Trial

Court on the date of the trial. Therefore, after hearing of the Plaintiff,

on 24.11.1988 the learned Judge entered his judgment allowing the

partition of the land as per the schedule of shares contained in the

judgment (vide Page 230-234 of the appeal brief).

3

The interlocutory decree had been entered accordingly and thereafter

a commission was issued for the purpose of preparing the final

scheme of partition. After the said commission was returned to Court

by the Court Commissioner, on or about 01.05.1990, the Appellants

had preferred an application under the provisions of Section 48(4) of

the Partition Law, Law No. 21 of 1977 as amended to vary the

judgment by establishing their claims.

Having received the application of the Appellants, the learned District

Judge fixed the case for inquiry and after the said inquiry, the learned

Judge (on 14.10.1996) refused to grant relief under Section 48(4) of

the Partition Law to the Appellants for the reasons stated therein in

the said order (vide pages 314-319 of the appeal brief).

Therefore, in the instant appeal, the Appellants seeking to challenge

the said order dated 14.10.1996 of the learned District Judge of

Gampaha.

It is to be noted that, when the appeal was taken for argument (on

09.07.2012) Counsel for the Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent had

raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the appeal

without leave of this Court first had obtained. At that time, both

parties were agreed to tender their respective written submissions on

that question and invite Court to rule on that matter first.

On the same day, both parties agreed to consider the propriety of the

impugned order to the extent as to whether the learned District Judge

is correct in his findings that the Appellants have failed to adduce

plausible explanation or excuse as to their absence. They further

4

agreed that, in the event of the Appellants succeeding in the above

two matters is to agree to argue the question as to whether the

Appellants should have been accommodated under Section 48(4) of

the Partition Law.

In case the Appellants are unsuccessful on the above two matters, this

Court decided to place on record for future reference that this appeal

would then come to an end. (Vide proceeding dated 09.07.2012 of the

Court of Appeal).

Having observed the above matrix of the case, now I would like to deal

with the fateful findings of the learned District Judge and the relevant

legal issues therein.

Section 26 as well as Section 48 of the Partition Law confers finality to

Interlocutory Decrees entered in a partition action. Accordingly, such a

decree becomes good and sufficient evidence of the title of any

person as to any right, share or interest awarded to him and it will be

considered as final and conclusive for all purposes against all persons

whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to

have, in the land to which such a Decree relates. However, such

finality would operate subject to the matters referred to in Section 48

of the Partition Law particularly to the matters in Sub-Section 4

thereof. Therefore, it is clear that an Interlocutory Decree entered in a

partition action binds the whole world subject to the matters referred

to in Section 48 of the Partition Law.

The statutory provisions in question may be examined as follows:

5

Section 48(4)(c)

"If upon inquiry into such application, after prior notice

to the parties to the action deriving any interest under

the interlocutory decree, the Court is satisfied:

(i) that the party affected had no notice whatsoever of the

said partition action prior to the date of the interlocutory

decree or having duly filed his statement of claim

registered his address, failed to appear at the trial owing

to accident, misfortune or other unavoidable cause, and

(ii) that such party had a prima facie right, title or interest to

or in the said land, and

(iii) that right, title or interest has been extinguished or such

party has been otherwise prejudicially affected by the

said interlocutory decree,

the Court shall upon such terms and conditions as the

Court in its discretion may impose, which may include an

order for payment of costs as well as an order for

security for costs, grant special leave to the applicant."

Section 48(4)(d)

"Where the Court grants special leave as herein-before

provided the Court shall forthwith settle in the form of

issues the questions of tact and law arising from the

pleadings and any further pleadings which are relevant

to the claim set up in the petition only, the Court shall

6

appoint a date for trial and determination of the issues.

The applicant, unless the Court otherwise orders, shall

cause notice of such date to be given to all parties whose

rights under the interlocutory decree are likely to be

affected or to their registered attorney in such manner

as the Court shall specify. The Court shall thereafter

proceed to hear and determine the matters in issue in

accordance with the procedure applicable to the trial of

a partition action."

In the light of the above mandatory requirements of the law, I now

proceed to examine the Appellants averment.

When the Appellants pleading on their absence before the District

Court to vary the order, they submitted that the alleged incident had

taken place in the year 1988 and the 32nd Defendant-Appellant had

suffered the ill effects of the said snake bite for a long period of time.

It is an important fact that the Medical Certificate tendered on behalf

of the said 32nd Defendant-Appellant had been issued in the year 1990

a date about two years after the date of the incident. It is also

revealed from the said evidence of the 32nd Defendant that the

Medical Practitioner had commenced treatments only in the year

1990 as the 32nd Defendant was presented to him to treat the ill

effects of the snake bite which had taken place some time back.

The reason for the absence of the 9th Defendant-Appellant at the trial

was attributed to the fact that his wife the 32nd Defendant-Appellant

was ill within the said period and he had to tend the needs of his wife.

7

He further stated that he had forgotten the dates of the trial under

the circumstances.

Further, the other Defendant who had not participated at the trial

stage is the 2nd Defendant-Appellant who claimed that he was

suffering from the ill effects of a blow to his head which had taken

place a considerable period prior to the date of the trial.

The learned District Judge in his order dated 14.10.1996 had stated

reasons for rejecting the excuses given by the defaulting Appellants

for not appearing before the Courts on the trial dates. He stated as

follows:

23.03.88 .

(Page 318 of the appeal brief)

Therefore, it is crystal clear from the fateful judgment that the learned

District Judge did not satisfy with the evidence adduced at the inquiry

and refused the Appellants Application. Further, the learned Judge

was reasoning that the 32nd Defendant-Appellant was not taking any

vigilant steps to appear by his personal capacity or by way of his

attorney.

I am of the view that the 32nd Defendant-Appellant has not acted with

the utmost promptitude when he decided to purge the alleged order

in the District Court. As held by several cases in our Courts, in the

absence of a satisfactory explanation as to why the alleged party could

not come before a Court of law in a reasonable period of time is

considered as an irreparable delay [vide: Babu Appu vs. Simon Appu

(1907) 11 NLR 44]. Thus, I fully subscribed with the learned District

Judge on the absence of plausible explanation or excuse as to their

absence.

As I mentioned earlier, Counsel for the Respondents took up a

Preliminary objection stating that the said order dated 14.10.1996 is

not a judgment and it is an order within the meaning of Section 754(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code, No. 2 of 1889, as subsequently amended,

which an appeal may be preferred with the leave of this Court.

9

Thus, this Court has to decide whether the questioned order dated

14.10.1996 is a final judgment or an order which comes under Section

754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. In order to decide this question, I

would like to consider certain judicial decisions.

In Shubrook vs. Tufnell [(1882) 9 QBD 621], where Jessel, MR and

Lindley, LJ held that, an order is final if it finally determines the matter

in litigation. Thus the issue of final and interlocutory depended on the

nature and the effect of the order made.

In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathie [(1998) 3 SLR 232], the Supreme Court

has held that the interlocutory decree is not final and the order of the

District Court is not a judgment within the meaning of Section 754(1)

and 754(5) of Civil Procedure Code for purpose of an appeal.

In Salter Rex and Co. vs. Gosh [(1972) 2 All ER 865] Lord Denning, M.

R. stated that:

If their decision whichever way it is given, will if it

stands finally dispose of matter in dispute, I think that for

the purpose of these Rules it is final. On the other hand,

if their decision, if given in one way, will finally dispose of

the matter in dispute, but, if given in the order, will allow

the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but

interlocutory.

As held in Wickremarathne vs. Samarawickrama [(1995) 2 SLR 212],

who did not appear at the trial and whose rights in the corpus have

10

been extinguished by the interlocutory decree may apply for special

leave to establish his rights.

Now, I again recall the decision of Ranjit vs. Kusumawathie and

others (supra). In this case the original 4th Defendant having filed his

statement of claim failed to appear at the trial and the evidence was

led for the Plaintiff, other parties been absent, the judgment and the

interlocutory decree were entered accordingly. The original 4th

Defendant applied to the Trial Court, in terms of Sub-Section 48

(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law, for special leave which permits a

defaulting party to make an application to enter the case. The

application for special leave was rejected by the District Court. The

appellant then preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal against the

order, in terms of Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code as if that

order made by the District Court was a judgment. The Court of

Appeal rejected the appeal on the basis that what was appealed from

was an order within the meaning of Section 754(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code from which an appeal that therefore an appeal could

lie only with leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

In Ranjit case, the main issue was whether the refusal of the

Application made under Section 48(4)(a)(iv) is a judgment

contemplated under Section 754(1) or an order under 754(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

Dheerarathne, J. in his judgment (at page 238) stated that:

A party to a partition action making an application in

terms of subsection 48(4)(a)(iv) in order to establish his

11

right, title or interest, has two hurdles to surmount. First

he has to satisfy court, in terms of subsection (c) that (i)

having filed his statement of claim and registered his

address, he failed to appear at the trial owing to

accident, misfortune or other unavoidable cause, and (ii)

that he had a prima facie right, title or interest in the

corpus, and (iii) that such right , title or interest has been

extinguished or such party has been otherwise

prejudicially affected by the interlocutory decree. Then

only the court will grant special leave. After granting

special leave, in terms of subsection (d), the court will

settle in the form of issues the questions of fact and law

arising from the pleadings relevant to the claim and then

appoint a day for trial and determination of the issues.

The second hurdle the party has to surmount is the

determination of those issues by court after trial, in

terms of sub-section (e).

The order appealed from is an order made against the

appellant at the first hurdle. Can one say that the order

made on the application of the 4th defendant is one such

that whichever way the order was given, it would have

finally determined the litigation? Far from that, even if

the order was given in favour of the appellant, he has to

face he second hurdle, namely the trial to vindicate his

claim

In the above mentioned case, Dheerarathne, J. followed the

judgments of Lord Esher in Salaman vs. Warner [(1891) 1 QB 734],

12

and Lord Dennings judgment in Salter Rex vs. Gosh (supra) which

adopted the application approach and held that the order appealed

from is not a judgment within the meaning of Sections 754(1) and

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In the circumstances, I hold that the order (dated 14.10.1996) given by

the learned District Judge of Gampaha is not a final order and the

Appellant should have filed a leave to Appeal Application under

Section 754(2) instead of filling an appeal under Section 754(1) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

For the forgoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned District Judge. Therefore, the appeal is

dismissed.

I make no order as to costs.

Appeal dismissed.
