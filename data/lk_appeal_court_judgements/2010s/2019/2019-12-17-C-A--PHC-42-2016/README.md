K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

o I. The above-named Accused was charged in the Magistrate's Court of Tangalle

under Section 3A of the Animals Act and under section 2 to be read with section

2(I)c of the Cruelty to Animals Act. Upon convicting the Accused on his own

plea of guilty, the learned Magistrate has sentenced the Accused by imposing

fines on both counts.

02. The Appellant as the Power of Attorney Holder for the registered owner had

made a claim for the vehicle that was used to transport the cattle. After holding

the inquiry, the learned Magistrate on 28.04.2015 ordered the vehicle to be

confiscated. The Appellant filed an application in the Provincial High Court of

Tangalle to get the order of confiscation of the vehicle revised. After inquiry, the

learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate by her

Judgment dated 25.05.2016. Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, the Appellant preferred this appeal.

03. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant has taken

necessary precautions to prevent the vehicle being used to transport cattle or to

be used for any other illegal activities. It was further submitted that the

Appellant had no knowledge of the Accused committing the offence. Further, it

was submitted that the learned Magistrate has erred when he rejected the

document marked as 'Xl '.

04. Counsel further submitted that there is no evidence to show that the Appellant

was present at the time of the detection and that he was privy to the offence. The

vehicle concerned was never involved in any offences of similar nature.

. . .

05. Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent submitted that the

document marked as 'Xl' has no legal validity. The Appellant has no locus

standi, counsel submitted.

06. At the vehicle inquiry before the learned Magistrate, only the Appellant gave

evidence. According to his testimony, the registered owner of the vehicle is one

Ms. R.A.P.P. Ranasinghe from whom he has taken over the vehicle on the

document marked as 'Xl'. In terms of 'Xl' said registered owner had already

obtained a facility from Citizens Development Bank for the vehicle and

therefore the absolute owner had been the said finance institution. 'Xl' doesn't

show that the absolute owner has consented or permitted to transfer or hand over

the vehicle to the Appellant. However, Appellant had taken over the vehicle on

the conditions stipulated in 'Xl'. The Appellant had thereafter, handed over the

vehicle to the Accused upon signing the agreement 'X3'. According to the

Appellant's testimony, the Appellant had given the vehicle to the Accused on

lease subject to the terms and conditions stipulated in the agreement 'X3'.

Section 3A of the Animals Act provides;

"where any person is convicted of an offence under this

part or any regulations made thereunder, any vehicle used in the

commission of such offence shall, in addition to any other punishment

prescribed for such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting

Magistrate, to confiscation;

Provided however, that in any case where the owner of the vehicle is a

third party, no order of confiscation shall be made, if the owner

proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has taken all precautions

5

Website Copy Website Copy

to prevent the use of such vehicle or that the vehicle has been used

without his knowledge for the commission of the offence. "

07. Appellant testified that he inquired from the Accused over the telephone as to

whether the Accused is using the vehicle as agreed. He said that he sometimes

inspected the vehicle and that he did not notice any alterations made to the

vehicle other than to transport firewood. However, in cross examination he

admitted that when he saw the vehicle after the detection by the police, there

were changers done to the lorry. He admitted that there were two wooden poles

fixed inside the lorry and also an iron rod was fixed on the floor behind. It is

obvious that those changes were done to transport cattle. The detection was

made by the police on 06.08.201l. The date on which the Appellant leased out

the vehicle to the Accused was 14.07.201l. Therefore, the alterations to the

vehicle to transport cattle had been made within those 21 days. If the Appellant

inspected the vehicle on and off as he testified, he could have observed the said

alterations made to the vehicle. It shows that the Appellant was not truthful

when he said that he inspected the vehicle on and off and he did not see the

alterations made.

08. In case of Mary Matilda Silva V. Inspector of Police, Habarana, rCA (PHC)

86/1997, 08.07.2010J, Court said;

"In my view, for the owner of the vehicle to discharge the

burden (1) that he/she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of

the vehicle for the commission of the offence (2) that the vehicle had

been used for the commission of the offence without his/her

knowledge, mere giving instructions is not sufficient. In order to

6

Website Copy Website Copy

discharge the burden embodied in the proviso to section 3A of the

Animals Act is it sufficient for the owner to say that instructions not to

use the vehicle for illegal purpose had been given to the driver? If the

courts of this country is going to say that it is sufficient, then all what

the owner in a case of this nature has to say is that he gave said

instructions. Evenfor the second offence, this is all that he has to say.

Then there is no end to the commission of the offence and to the use of

the vehicle for the commission of the offence. Every time when the

vehicle is detected with cattle all what he has to say is that he had

given instructions to the driver. Then the purpose of the legislature in

enacting the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act is frustrated. "

09. In Umma Habeeba V Ole Dehiattakandiya [1999/3 SLR 89, it was decided

that;

"What section 3A means is that the vehicle shall necessarily be

confiscated if the owner fails to prove that the offence was committed

without the knowledge but not otherwise. If, as contended, the

Magistrate was given a discretion to consider whether to confiscate or

not - the Magistrate could confiscate even when the offence was

committed without the knowledge of the owner taking into

consideration other damnable circumstances apart from knowledge or

lack of it on the part of the owner. "

10. When considering the above-mentioned facts and circumstances with the case

precedents, I find that the Appellant has failed to prove any of the two

requirements mentioned in the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act.

7

. . .

11. At this juncture, I find that it is also important to discuss the submissions made

by the learned DSG for the Respondent that the Appellant has no locus standi in

the matter.

12. Who is the 'owner' referred to in the provIso to section 3A? This was

extensively discussed by His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew in case of L. B.

Finance PLC V. O.Le. Police Station, Beliatta and others rCA (PHC) APN

4112009, 09. 12. 201 OJ where it was held;

"Who is the owner? Can it be said that the absolute owner (the

finance company) committed the offence or it was committed with the

knowledge or participation of him? The answer is obviously no.

Surely a finance company cannot participate in a commission of an

offence of this nature when the vehicle was not with it. Then the

owner envisaged in the law cannot be the absolute owner. If the court

is going to release the vehicle on the basis that the owner of the

vehicle is the absolute owner, then after the release it is possible for

the absolute owner to give the vehicle again to the registered owner

who can use it for the same purpose. In the event of the registered

owner using it for the same purpose and it being detected by the

police the same procedure will take place resulting in the vehicle

being handed over to the registered owner. Then there will be no end

to the commission of the offence. If the courts of this country take this

attitude, the purpose of the legislature in enacting the said provisions

of the law would be defeated. Further, courts would encourage the

offenders to commit offences of this nature. In my view, courts should

8

Website Copy Website Copy

not interpret the law to give an absurd meaning to the law. In this

connection, I would like to consider a passage from 'Interpretation of

Statutes' by Bindra 71h edition page 235. "It is a well known rule of

construction that a statute should not be construed so as to impute

absurdity to the legislature. " For these reasons I hold that the owner

envisaged in Section 3A of the Animals Act is not the absolute owner

and the owner, in a case of this nature, is the person who has control

over the use of the vehicle. A bsolute owner has no control over the

use of the vehicle except to retake possession of the vehicle for non-

payment of installments where the vehicle is on a hire purchase

agreement. Here too absolute owner cannot retake possession of the

vehicle if 75% of the price agreed has been paid. Vide section 20 of

the Consumer Credit Act No. 29 of J 982. Therefore, the principle that

'order of confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes on a

balance of probability that he has taken all precautions to prevent the

use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence or that the vehicle

has been used for the commission of the offence without his

knowledge' is not applicable when the absolute owner makes an

application for the release of the vehicle in cases where the allegation

is that animals have been transported in the vehicle in contravention

of the relevant legal provisions. The appeal of the Appellant should

therefore fail. "

13. In the above L. B. Finance case, the claimant was the absolute owner who had

no control over the vehicle. Although the claimant in this case is not the absolute

owner, the same principle would apply. The Appellant had already handed over

the possession of the vehicle to the Accused on the agreement X3. On that point

9

Website Copy Website Copy

. . ,

onwards until the raid in this case was conducted by the police, the vehicle had

been under the control of the Accused, not the Appellant. This is not a case

where the Appellant employed the Accused as a driver for a specific purpose. He

has given control of the vehicle to the Accused upon signing the agreement of

lease marked as X3. Therefore, as described in L. B. Finance case, in this case

the Appellant cannot be considered as the 'owner' envisaged in proviso to

section 3A of the Animals Act. Hence, I am of the considered view that the

Appellant had no locus standi in the Magistrate's Court as a claimant. Neither

the Accused under whose control the vehicle was, nor the registered owner has

given evidence at the claim inquiry in the Magistrate's Court. Further, it is

pertinent to note that the Appellant is claiming the vehicle as the Power of

Attorney Holder of the registered owner. Neither the registered owner nor the

Appellant had control over the vehicle at the time of the detection, but with the

Accused.

14. Counsel for the Appellant in his written submissions has referred to a portion of

the Judgment in case of Abubakerge Jaleel V. OIC ICA (PHC) 108/2010/,

where the court said that the owner cannot be seated all the time in the lorry to

closely supervise for what purpose the lorry is used. Further, court has referred

to supervision of personal drivers employed by the government servants,

Ministers and Judicial Officers and so on. However, in the instant case the

Accused was not the personal driver of the Appellant. Appellant had handed

over the possession of the vehicle to the Accused for one year on lease giving

him the control of the vehicle. Therefore, the above submission would not be of

any assistance to the Appellant's case.

For the reasons stated above, this appeal should necessarily fail.

15. Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 26.05.2016 and the order of the

learned Magistrate dated 28.04 2015 confiscating the vehicle are affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed. The Appellant is ordered to hand over the vehicle

immediately to the Registrar, Magistrate's Court, Tangalle.
