Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking several reliefs in the

nature of writs of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition

basically preventing the respondents from retiring the petitioner

from the Sri Lanka Army without promoting him to the rank of

Brigadier with effect from 21.03.2013.

The petitioners last substantive promotion was on 21.03.2008

to the rank of Colonel. The next promotion was to the rank of

Brigadier. Promotion is not automatic. The officer shall earn

the promotion on merits. The respondents in paragraph 24(i) of

their statement of objections have stated that the promotions in

the Sri Lanka Army are given on the criteria laid down under the

Army Officers Service Regulations (Regular Force), 1992 as made

by the President in his capacity as the Commander in

Chiefvide P13(a). This has not been denied by the petitioner.

In terms of Regulation 3(1)(b) of the Army Pension and

Gratuities Code, 1981, the petitioner ought to have been retired

on 21.03.2013, having served the maximum period in the rank

of Colonel without being promoted to the next rank.

In paragraph 11 of the petition, the petitioner says that the

Promotion Board convened in October 2009 to promote officers

to the rank of Brigadier did not promote him to the rank of

Brigadier.

The respondents in paragraph 24(iv) of their statement of

objections state that the Army Promotion Board No.2 which

assembled on 27.02.2013 had upheld the previous Promotion

Board recommendations not to promote the petitioner to the

rank of Brigadier due to inter alia poor disciplinary record, but

3

having regard to the full period of service, had recommended to

grant one-year extension upon the petitioner reaching the

maximum period in the substantive rank of Colonel, i.e. from

21.03.2013 to 20.03.2014. This extension has not been

divulged in detail by the petitioner in the petition.

The petitioner in paragraph 2.5(b) of the written submissions

seems to be stating that in view of Regulation 3(2)(b) of the Army

Pension and Gratuity Code, 1981, this extension is illegal as this

has not happened with the concurrence of the President.

According to paragraphs 20-22 of the petition, the petitioner has

met the new Army Commander on 24.12.2013 to tell his

grievances regarding denial of promotion, and thereafter he has

been summoned before the Army Advisory Board on 02.04.2014.

It seems to me that when he was summoned before the Advisory

Board on 02.04.2014, his term has already expired as his

extension was only up to 20.03.2014.

Be that as it may, the Advisory Board has recommended another

one year of extension of service from 20.03.2014 to 20.03.2015

and further recommended to promote the petitioner to the rank

of Brigadier at his retirement in order to award him the post-

retirement benefits. This extension is also may be illegal

according to the petitioners argument.

According to paragraph 24(vi) of the statement of objections,

upon further request made to the Commander of the Army, the

petitioner has been given another extension of six months from

20.03.2015 to 19.09.2015.

As seen from R4 and R5, His Excellency the President has

approved the promotion of the petitioner to the rank of Brigadier

with effect from 19.09.2015 and his retirement with effect from

20.09.2015. This has happened whilst the case was in progress.

The matter shall end there.

As seen from R2, R2(a)-(d), the past record of the petitioner is

not exemplary. He has been found guilty for some offences and

dealt with.

R3 certified by an Attorney-at-Law serving in the Legal

Directorate of the Army gives a description on the basis for

extensions given, promotion denied and later granted to be

effective from the date of retirement.

According R3, even the Advisory Board, which was convened

particularly to consider his grievances favourably, has come to

the conclusion that although the petitioners performances at his

early stage of career was praiseworthy, he has not maintained

the same consistency in the latter part and thereby has failed in

meeting standards in the required criteria to become eligible for

the next promotion. Nevertheless, the Advisory Board has

granted yet another one-year extension and the promotion to the

next rank of Brigadier at the time of retirement.

The petitioner himself has tendered P7(a) and P7(b) containing

allegations against him. The petitioner has given his

explanation in respect of P7(a) by P7(c). Even though this is not

the forum to look into that matter, for me, that explanation is

not very convincing. There is no explanation in respect of P7(b).

Unless there is a grave injustice or irregularity on the face of the

record, this Court in the exercise of writ jurisdiction will not

5

interfere with the promotions of the Army. I find no such

injustice or irregularity. The petitioners grievances have been

adequately heard by different fora at different times and granted

reliefs, sometimes, going out of the way, according to the

petitioners own showing.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed. No costs.
