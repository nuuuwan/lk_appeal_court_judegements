Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Harsha Soza, P.C., with Rajindh Perera for the

Petitioner.

Hiran de Alwis for the Respondents.

Decided on: 06.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a mandate in the

nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Sri

Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association contained in the

letter marked X6 dated 10.03.2015 whereby the petitioner was

banned from attending the first two Under 20 Seven League

Rugby Tournament matches in which St. Josephs College was

participating.

The petitioner, has attended (it appears, as an officer of the

Sports Committee of St. Josephs College) the quarter final

match on 01.02.2015 between St. Josephs College and

Isipathana College played at the Royal College Complex,

Colombo 7. Isipathana College has won.

The petitioner in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the petition states

that in the wake of the defeat of his College, a false allegation

has been made to the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football

Association that the petitioner abused the 4th respondent

referee. That means, the petitioner knew on that day that there

was an (unfounded) allegation against him that he abused the

referee.

3

Then in paragraph 21 of the petition the petitioner states that

the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association sent the letter

X4 to the 5th respondent-Principal of his College (St. Josephs

College) requesting the Principal to inform among others the

petitioner to attend an inquiry at the Royal College Conference

Room on 12.02.2015 at 6.00 pm regarding an incident of abuse

of the referee at the said match.

The petitioner in paragraph 23 admits that the Principal duly

informed of the said inquiry.

However, in paragraph 24 of the petition, the petitioner says that

he did not attend the said inquiry because he did not abuse the

referee, nor did he have any reason to think that the inquiry was

related to him, and also he did not know anybody else abusing

the referee.

According to paragraph 2 of X6, at the inquiry held on

12.02.2015, (among others) the Master in Charge, the Chief

Coach and the Assistant Coach of St. Josephs College have

participated.

Thereafter the petitioner through his lawyers has sent a strongly

worded letter dated 18.02.2015 to the 2nd respondent-Secretary

of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association stating inter

alia that:

This letter serves to put you and all those behind you and

those from whom you take instructions that my client will

not hesitate to take stern action and sue you and others

responsible for damages in the event there is an attempt on

your part to discredit and or harm my clients reputation

directly or indirectly by naming him in any inquiry or

4

publication regarding this matter without proper

investigation and cogent evidence.

It is clear from the above letter that the petitioner was not willing

to cooperate with the inquiry. Why I say so is that, if he wanted

to clear his name, without sending such a threatening letter, he

could have asked the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football

Association to give him another opportunity to place his side of

the story before coming to a conclusion, as by that time, no

decision has been taken by the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby

Football Association regarding the alleged incident.

Not being overawed by such threat, the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby

Football Association has sent X6 dated 10.03.2015 to the

Principal of the St. Josephs College stating that abusing the

referee is an offence in accordance with the Rules of the Under

20 Seven League Rugby Tournament 2015 signed by all the

Principals of the Colleges, and therefore the Disciplinary

Committee of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association

decided to ban the petitioner from attending the first two

matches of the said Tournament. In that letter the Principal has

been asked to convey it to the petitioner and also further asked

the principal not to issue tickets to the petitioner to watch the

said first two matches.

The petitioner in paragraph 27 of the petition states that he was

informed of the said ban and he complied with the said ban

under protest.

It is after more than four months, the petitioner has filed this

writ application challenging the decision in X6.

5

The learned counsel for the respondents has taken up several

preliminary objections to the maintainability of this application

including that invocation of writ jurisdiction of this Court

challenging the said decision is completely misconceived in law.

There is a great substance in that argument.

However, I think, I can dispose of this matter on more

fundamental principles of law.

It is common ground that writ jurisdiction of this Court cannot

be invoked as of right. It is a discretionary relief. In that regard,

the conduct of the party applying for writ is intensely relevant.

The petitioner may be completely innocent, but he cannot keep

it to himself and decide his own case. There is a complainant

(the referee) and a complaint. He knew it at least after the first

date of the inquiry to which the representatives of his school

participated. But he did not want to intervene and vindicate his

name. He will have to blame himself for it. After he was

informed of the punishmenta ban for two matcheshe says he

complied. At least at that time no attempt has been made

seeking an opportunity to place facts before the Association.

In any event, if the petitioner was not satisfied with the said

finding and punishment, there is a procedure to appeal against

such decisions. This is stated in page 11 of the Hand Book

2014 of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association

marked R2. That has not been followed by the petitioner. The

petitioner cannot come straightaway before this Court

challenging the decision of the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football

Association by way of a writ, which is a public law remedy

involving public duty. When there is an alternative remedy writ

will not generally lie. The argument of the learned Presidents

6

Counsel for the petitioner in that regard is that only schools can

appeal according to that procedure. If it is true, the petitioner

should have through the school which he represented (St.

Josephs) preferred the appeal. This has not been done.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner with costs which I fix

at Rs.25,000/=.
