****************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Negombo for

the murder of his wife Rajapaksha Nadeeka Damayanthi and also of his 7-

year-old daughter Warnakulasuriya Achala Roshini on or about 4th April

2009 at Kochchikade.

At the conclusion of the trial without a jury, the appellant was

convicted on both counts of murder and sentenced to death. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant sought to

challenge its validity on the following grounds of appeal;

a. the items of circumstantial evidence wholly inadequate to

support the conviction,

b. the trial Court erred in failing to apply the principles governing

the evaluation of circumstantial evidence, 2

c. the prosecution failed to exclude the possibility of a 3rd party

committing the deaths,

d. when evaluating the defence evidence the trial Court erred in

examining its legality and tenability in the light of prosecution

case,

e. the trial Court reversed the presumption of innocence when it

shifted the burden of proof on the appellant in his defence of

denial,

f. the trial Court has relied on inadmissible evidence,

g. the trial Court failed to consider evidence favourable to the

appellant.

In VIew of the scope of these several grounds of appeal, it is

necessary to refer to the evidence presented before the trial Court by the

parties, albeit briefly, for correct appreciation of them in the proper context.

The prosecution case is based entirely on items of circumstantial

evidence.

Of the several lay witnesses, whom the prosecution had relied upon

in order to prove its case before the trial Court, three of them, namely

Rohana Lal Silva, Dinesh Kumara Fernando and Roshan Fonseka were

neighbours of the appellant, while the other witness Rajapaksage Antony is

his father-in-law. IP Haroon Doole and 51 Milton Kumaranayaka of

Kochchikade Police have conducted investigations. Consultant Judicial

Medical Officers Channa Perera and Ajit Tennakoon had given evidence in

relation to the post mortem examinations they conducted on the bodies of

3

the deceased. Witness Peduru Fernando was also called by the prosecution

as a witness in rebuttal.

Lal Silva was woken up from his sleep by his wife at about 4.00. or

5.00 in the morning of 4th April 2009 as she heard a scream of a woman

coming from the direction of appellant's house. The witness had then run

towards that house. On his way he saw the wife of the deceased running

towards him. She then collapsed on the road. Witness saw she was

bleeding from her face. He immediately sent for a vehicle to rush her to a

hospital. When he was about to lift her to the vehicle, the appellant raised

cries that his daughter was cut. Hearing this, the wife of the appellant had

run back to the house. At the same time her daughter with a bended head

came running out of it. She collapsed at the feet of one Wimalawathie who

used to care for her. The girl had her neck slashed. When the wife of the

appellant went inside the house, there was a sound of some disturbance in

the kitchen. Later the witness saw the wife of the appellant lying in a pool

of blood in the kitchen.

The appellant was also seen inside the house apparently crying over

the incident.

Witness Roshan is the immediate neighbour of the appellant who

shared a common boundary with him. On the day of the incident, he too

was woken up to a screaming of a woman. He looked through his

window. There was a sound of a smash of a plate rack which came from

the kitchen of the appellant's house. He gauged from the sound of the

screaming, the woman was running towards the front of the house. He too

came out of his house to have a look as to what was happening. At that

4

point, he saw the 7-year-old daughter of the appellant collapsing near their

gate and died. She was holding her neck.

The witness saw Lal Silva, one of his neighbours, there. A crowd of

villagers also have gathered in front of the appellant's house by this time.

The appellant, who was inside his house, shouted at them not to come into

the house.

However, after awhile when the noises subsided Roshan went inside

the appellant's house with Lal's son. He saw the appellant seated on the

floor holding his head. He also saw the wife of the appellant lying on the

kitchen floor in a pool of blood. The appellant told Roshan that two persons

who held him at gun point had killed his wife using a "pointed stake for

husking coconut" (" @OJ@ (,@") and his daughter and thereafter fled through

the back door.

Dinesh Kumara Fernando too is a neighbour of the appellant who

rushed to the appellant's house after hearing the scream of the latter's

wife. He saw her fallen on the road. It was Lal who directed him to bring

his lorry to take the injured woman to hospital. When he returned with the

vehicle, he heard the appellant's shout that his child was cut and they [the

assailants] had left. At that time the appellant's wife was not there where

the witness saw her a few minutes ago.

Then he got off from the vehicle and walked up to the appellant's

house. He saw the appellant's daughter fallen in front of the house and her

neck had been cut. Since the appellant claimed that his family was

attacked by intruders, the witness and the others who have gathered there

5

had mounted a search in the surrounding area including the rear side of

his house, but it yielded no clue as to any intruder's presence.

Witness Antony is the appellant's father-in-law. His evidence relates

to the activities of the appellant and his wife in the previous evening. His

daughter, having spent the day with him, had left in the evening at about

9.00 p.m. with the appellant, who came there to accompany her. The

appellant, then requested the witness to keep his hand phone switched on,

so that he could contact him if there is an emergency. At about 5.00 a.m. in

the following morning, the appellant called him on his phone in order to

break the news that his daughter and granddaughter were cut to death by

intruders. This was the first time that the appellant had ever contacted the

witness over the phone.

Referring to the marriage of his daughter to the appellant, the

witness said there were regular problems in their relationship and when

the murdered grand-daughter was born, the appellant did not visit the

hospital to see her. It was the witness who had to accompany the wife of

the appellant and her new born baby to the appellant's house since he

showed no interest in taking them home.

Consultant JMO, Dr. Channa Perera had performed the post mortem

examination on the body of the daughter of the deceased. Of the two

injuries seen on her body, there was one 16 em long deep cut injury on her

neck severing her trachea and gullet. It also damaged her carotid vein. This

injury could have been inflicted with the manna knife marked P2A and the

probability of using the manna knife to inflict the said injury was "very

high". After receiving the said injury, the deceased could have walked a

6

few feet although she was unable to speak due to her tracheal injury. Her

death was clearly due to this injury.

He also observed another 14 cm long contused abrasion below the

deep cut injury on the neck.

Post mortem examination of the wife of the appellant was

performed by Consultant JMO. Dr. Ajit Tennakoon. There were 14 injuries

on her body. 1st to 6th injuries were located on and around head while 7th to

13th injuries were seen on her torso and legs. She had a 15 cm long cut

injury on top of her head with a contused margin. Corresponding to this

external injury, internally her skull was fragmented damaging her brain.

There were 5 cm and 4 cm long two superficial cut injuries on her face and

neck.

Of the injuries noted on her torso, there was 18 cm long curved cut

injury on her chest and another 7 cm long cut injury on the shoulder. She

had grazed abrasions on her hands and legs. The 12th, 13th and 14th injuries

were cut injuries on her hands which are termed by the Consultant JMO as

defensive injuries. Her death was due to injuries caused to her head with

sharp and blunt weapon. The head injuries suffered by the deceased are

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The Consultant

JMO is of the opinion that the 1st to 3rd injuries on her head, could have

been caused by attacking with the I/@OJ<5j GC3", marked P6 by the

prosecution, when she was in an upright position. The cut injuries could

have been inflicted with the manna knife marked as P2A.

7

.. It was IP Doole who conducted investigation into this incident. He

received the first information about the incident on 04.04.2009 at 5.10 a.m.

The police party led by him arrived at the scene which was located about 2

Vz km from the Station and within half an hour of receiving information.

The house in which the two deceased have sustained cut injuries was

standing on a ten perch land which had three of its boundaries secured

with barbed wire fences. No damage to the barbed wire fence was noted

by the witness. The rear boundary was a 6 feet high parapet wall. The

surrounding area of the house was kept well lit at that time with the light

of two bulbs.

The main entrance to the house was a door secured to its door frame

with clamps. The rear door of the kitchen had a bolt and both these doors

had no signs of any forcible opening by an intruder. The witness also

examined the roof of the house covered with Calicut tiles. His examination

of the fence, the parapet wall and the roof indicated that there were no

signs of any entry by an outsider.

In the bed room, there was a triple bed which lined up with a single

bed and a mosquito net covering both these beds. IP Doole observed large

blood patch on the bed, blood stains on the net and another blood patch on

the floor of the room. The net had no damage and the witness was of the

view that fact negates any surprise attack on the victims. There was a

blood stained sarong in the same room.

He noted a trail of blood, left by a person with a bleeding injury who

may have moved very swiftly away from the room in the direction of the

8

main door. He also saw blood stained foot prints of a small child also in

the same direction.

In the kitchen, between the plate rack and a table, a large blood

patch was noted and at its corner a blood stained "O)@ G~", which had

been kept against the wall was found.

When he visited the scene, the appellant, who was clad in a pair of

trousers, was also there. He had no visible injuries on his person.

IP Doole directed his officers to record appellant's statement and

thereafter to record statements of others who had taken the two deceased

to hospital. After the initial investigations were over, IP Doole decided to

record another statement from the appellant. This was due to the faint trail

of blood he noted starting from the kitchen and ending at the fire wood

shed located closer to the kitchen. The appellant was questioned at length

at that point of time and was arrested at 4.00 p.m. Thereafter the 2nd

statement was recorded from the appellant at 4.35 p.m. and a blood

stained manna knife (P2A) which had been kept concealed under set of

roofing tiles of the fire wood shed was recovered, upon being pointed out

by the appellant. A bottle of "poison" was also recovered from a suitcase

which was kept at a different location which claimed to have used on the

cow the appellant reared

IP Doole, in his evidence said that he made investigations about a

man from gas depot with multiple references as (" G)zo t::ilC)

@J8JISJ)/ e:DJ@~)/ gem") during investigations before he arrested the appellant

that evening. The person who is referred to as "G)zo ~C) @J8JISJ) " is one

Ahamed Uvais Ahamed Ismail. He was married to a Sinhalese woman called

9

Kariyakarawanage Mary Susan Krishanthi Fernando and was operating a

dealership of LP gas distribution from a depot adjoining the Police Station.

He had broken his hand about a week prior to this incident in a motor

cycle accident and was in bandages when the witness made enquiries

about him that afternoon. The witness was emphatic that said Ahamed

Ismail was incapable of carrying out such an attack due to his injuries to

hand following the motor cycle accident.

SI Kumanayaka's participation in this investigation is limited to

recording of the 2nd statement of the appellant after his arrest, on the

instructions of IP Doole. The relevant portion of the appellant's statement,

which led to the discovery of a manna knife, was tendered by the

prosecution marked P12. This witness too confirmed that the appellant

had no injuries on his person at the time of making this statement.

When the trial Court ruled that the appellant had a case to answer,

he opted to offer evidence under oath.

It is the appellant's position that his wife had assaulted the wife of

Ismail over an accusation of monetary fraud which had in tum angered

her husband. The assault by the appellant's wife led to a criminal

prosecution which was subsequently referred to the Mediation Board.

There were death threats to his wife and two weeks prior to the incident a

complaint was lodged in this regard at the Police Station.

On that night, the appellant was woken up by Ahamed Ismail who

then took him to the pantry. There was another person with him. The

appellant was threatened by pointing a pistol at him and was assaulted

"inhumanly" by the two intruders. They also used the "lOJ@ G(9" in

10

assaulting him. When he shouted out due to these assaults, his wife came

to the pantry. She was also assaulted by the other person. When he

struggled with his attackers, he was hit with the pistol on his head and due

to this he lost consciousness. When he regained his senses, he saw his wife

lying in a pool of blood in the kitchen. He then got up and walked out of

the house from the front entrance of his house. Although there were

people who have gathered at the gate, no one came in due to fear. Again

the appellant went inside. At that point of time, his daughter came out

calling his wife and was hit once by an assailant in his presence.

At the police, he was arrested and assaulted, forcing him to accept

liability to the murder. The police obtained his signature to a 19 page

document. Then they took him to his house and returned with a bottle. No

recovery of a manna knife was made by the Police.

The prosecution called the father of the appellant, who filed an

affidavit in support of the application for bail filed in the trial Court as a

rebuttal witness. His evidence is that it was his lawyer who did everything

in Court and his affidavit did not contain an averment indicating any 3rd

party involvement.

With this factual background in mind, it is appropriate to deal with

the several grounds of appeal that had been urged before us at the hearing

of the instant appeal and the contention of the learned Counsel for the

appellant in support of them.

It was the submissions of the learned Counsel that the trial Court

had fallen into error when it evaluated the defence evidence for legality

and tenability in the light of prosecution case in violation of the principles

11

enunciated in the judgments of James Silva v Republic of Sri Lanka (1980)

2 Sri L.R. 167 and Addara Arachchi v The State (2002) 2 Sri L.R. 312.

The judgment of the trial Court begins with the factual positions that

had not been challenged by the appellant. The fact that only the two

deceased, the appellant's infant son and the appellant were in the house at

the time of the incident is not disputed. The death of the two deceased

were due to the injuries they received and the type of weapons used in the

said attack was also not disputed. The trial Court had, thereafter

considered the pivotal question the prosecution placed before it being

whether it was the appellant who inflicted those injuries to the two

deceased. The trial Court, in the same process of analysis also considered

the claim of the appellant that whether it was the two intruders who

inflicted those injuries and not him.

In James Silva v Republic of Sri Lanka (supra) the statement of the

trial Court that had been frowned upon by their Lordships is "I had

considered the defence of the accused and I hold that it is untenable and false in

the light of the evidence led by the prosecution"(emphasis original). In

view of this approach adopted by the trial Court, their Lordships then

stated;

"It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct

himself that he examines the tenability and

truthfulness of the evidence of the defence in the light

of the evidence led by the prosecution. Our criminal

law postulates a fundamental presumption of legal

innocence of every accused till the contrary is proved.

12

This is rooted in the concept of inviolability of every

individual in our society; now enshrined in our

Constitution. There is not even a surface presumption

of truth in the charge with which an accused is

indicted. Therefore, to examine the evidence of the

accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is to

reverse the presumption of innocence.

A satisfactory was to arrive at a verdict of guilt or

innocence is to consider all matters before the Court

adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence

in its totality without compartmentalising and, ask

himself whether as a prudent man, m the

circumstances of the particular case, he believes the

accused guilty of the charge or not guilty."

In the matter before us, the trial Court had considered the claim of

3rd party involvement of the appellant by applying the test of probability

on it. Having considered the evidence as a whole, the trial Court had

rejected the appellant's evidence.

Learned Counsel for the appellant mounted another challenge on

the validity of the conviction on the basis that the prosecution failed to

exclude the possibility of a 3rd party involvement in the incident.

Therefore, it is convenient to deal with this ground of appeal along

with the one we have already commenced.

13

The considerations that had been utilised by the trial Court in its

decision to reject the appellant's claim of 3rd party involvement and the

items of circumstantial evidence upon which his conviction to the double

murder is based upon are clearly inseparably interwoven.

It is clear that the trial Court had first rejected the evidence of the

appellant before it ventured to consider the question whether the

prosecution had established its case against him. The judgment of course

had not dealt with the evaluation process it had undertaken of the

evidence of the appellant.

In applying the tests of spontaneity and consistency of his claim of

3rd party involvement, it is seen from the evidence of the appellant during

his examination in chief that he did not disclose the alleged involvement of

the" G:lZO !:j)a) G:lz.!DG:l @.!Dcm" until the whole incident is over. He claims that

he went out of the house during the short interval just before his daughter

was attacked. However, although there were people gathered in front of

his house, he did not shout that" G:lZO !:j)a) G:lz.!DG:l @.!Dro)" had attacked him

and his wife. He did not complain about" G:lZO !:j)C) G:lz.!DG:l @.!Dro{' initially to

the police officers who arrived there early morning. Having visited the

hospital and learnt that his daughter was killed, he never thought it fit to

lodge a formal complaint with the Police implicating "G:lZO !:j)C) G:lz.!DG:l

@.6)ro{' but has opted to return home after his wife was transferred to

Colombo National Hospital. He did not mention in his evidence that he

ever disclosed the identity of the assailants to any of his neighbours.

It is stated by the appellant that he was "inhumanely" assaulted

with a pistol on his head and then with the "O)@ G(~( by the assailants.

14

Strangely, the appellant had no injury on his person after this sustained

inhumane attack. When challenged during cross examination, the

appellant had watered down his claim of "inhumane" attack by stating

that he did not suffer any injury after the attack as he was not assaulted

with any weapon. His claim of losing consciousness after a pistol attack on

head therefore becomes only a figment.

The appellant's version of events clearly seemed improbable one

when considered in the light of average human conduct. The appellant's

unexplained failure to call out for help, when he regained his senses to see

that his wife was fatally attacked by the "G)zc5 t:i)C'l G)zroG) &em" and

another, is not the conduct of an average person if placed under similar

circumstances. The circumstances under which his daughter claims to

have suffered a necessarily fatal cut injury on her neck also tainted with

improbabilities. The appellant's position is that the assailants have

attacked his wife after he lost his consciousness. She was attacked in the

kitchen. His daughter was in their bed room and came out in search of her

mother. The appellant, although standing right there did not prevent the

child going to the assailants and thereby receiving the fatal cut injury.

The appellant mounted no challenge to the evidence of his

neighbours as to the conduct attributed to him during the incident. Of

course he did implicate the person from the gas depot to his neighbours

when they entered the house after the wife of the appellant was found in

the kitchen. But the motive attributed to "G)zc5 t:i)C'l G)z&G) rom{' to kill his

wife, even if it is accepted as probable one, has not disclosed to them and

15

it does not explain the deliberate attack on his daughter, totally an

innocent victim who posed no threat to anyone. There was no reason to

attack the small girl as the initial attack on the wife had clearly failed.

When she attracted attention of others with her scream any assailant

would have fled the scene after this failed attempt. The appellant's claim

that he was assaulted and was physically overpowered therefore seemed

an improbable explanation for his failure to make even a nominal attempt

to act in self-defence.

The judgment of Ariyasinghe and Others v The Attorney General

(2004) 2 Sri L.R. 357 provides clear guidance that are applicable to Courts

in presuming the existence of a fact, when considered in the light of

normal human conduct. Amaratunga J states thus;

"When section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance is

closely examined, a very significant feature, which is

highly relevant to the exercise of the discretion

available to Court, becomes apparent. In deciding to

presume the existence of any facts, the Court can take

into account the common course of natural events,

human conduct and public and private business in

their relation to the facts of the particular case. Those

highlighted words indicate the guiding factor. Those

words clearly indicate that the reasonableness and the

correctness of the Court's decision to presume the

16

existence of any fact would depend on the particular

facts of that case. The question of drawing

presumption of a fact is a matter to be considered on a

case by case basis. The use of words "in their relation

to the facts of the case" prevents the Courts from

laying down any general guidelines regarding the

situation in which a Court may be justified on

drawing a presumption under section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance. It is the unenviable task of an

appellate Court to examine the validity of the trial

Judge's conclusion in the light of particular facts of the

case. "

The trial Court, in coming to its conclusion that the evidence of the

appellant could not be accepted owing to its inherent weaknesses, had

applied the principle laid down in the said judgment. This Court, having

carefully considered the evidence of the appellant and the reasoning

adopted by the trial Court in rejecting it, concurs with the conclusion the

trial Court has reached that it should be rejected.

In convicting the appellant on two counts of murder, the trial Court

had considered the several items of circumstantial evidence that had been

placed before it by the prosecution.

Before this Court considers the question whether the trial Court

applied the correct legal principle in coming to the said conclusion, it is

relevant to consider the nature of the evidentiary burden that had been

17

imposed on prosecution in proving a charge upon items of circumstantial

evidence.

In Rajapakse and Others v Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113, it

is stated by the Supreme Court that:

"Circumstantial evidence is evidence of facts where

the principal or the disputed fact, or factum

probandum could be inferred".

Archbold Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice (2015 Ed at

p.1469) sought to define the instances where such inference or

presumptions that could be drawn upon proof of a particular fact, on

following terms;

"A presumption arises where from the proof of some

fact the existence of another fact may be naturally be

inferred without further proof from the mere

probability of its having occurred. The fact thus

inferred to have occurred is said to be presumed, i.e. is

taken for granted until the contrary is proved by the

opposite party ... and is presumed the more readily, in

proportion to the difficulty of proving the fact by

positive evidence, and to the facility of disproving it or

proving facts inconsistent with it, if it never really

occurred. "

18

The judgment of Ukkuwa and Others v The Attorney General (2004)

2 Sri L.R. 263, the apex Court adopted the below quoted pronouncement of

the English judgment of R v Exall ;

" It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be

considered as a chain, and each piece as a link in the

chain, but that is not so, for then anyone link breaks,

the chain would fall. It is more like the case of rope

comprised of several chords. One strand of rope might

be insufficient to sustain the weight, but three strands

together may be quite of sufficient strength. Thus, it

may be in circumstantial evidence there may be a

combination of circumstances, no one of which would

raise a reasonable conviction or more than a mere

suspicion, bu t three taken together may create a

conclusion of guilt with as much certainty as human

affairs can require or admit."

The Court of Appeal has a long line of judicial precedents dealing

with the principles upon which a trial Court should decide the culpability

of an accused on prosecutions presented on circumstantial evidence.

In Kusumadasa v The State (2011), a divisional bench of this Court

considered these principles. Sisira De Abrew J has reproduced the

applicable principles, as laid down in these precedents, as follows;

"In the case of King v Abeywickrama Soertz J

remarked as follows. "In order to base a conviction on

19

circumstantial evidence the jury must be satisfied that

the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable

hypothesis of his innocence. If

In King v Appuhamy Keuneman J held that " . m

order to justify the inference of guilt from purely

circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and

incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt. If

In Podisingho v King, Dias J held that "in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial judge

to tell the jury that such evidence must be totally

inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and

must only be consistent with his guilt."

In a judgment pronounced in 1989 by the Supreme Court of India,

their Lordships have crystallised the applicable principles in relation to

prosecutions based on items of circumstantial evidence. It is stated by

Pandian J, in Reddy v State of Andra Pradesh AIR 1990 SC 79 that;

"When a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such

evidence must satisfy the following tests;

(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt

is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly

established;

20

(2) those circumstances should be of a definite

tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the

accused;

(3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form

a chain so complete that there is no escape from the

conclusion that within all human probability the

crime was committed by the accused and none else;

(4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain

conviction must be complete and incapable of

explanation of any other hypothesis than that of

guilt of the accused and such evidence should not

only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but

should be inconsistent with his innocence."

These principles were re-iterated by the Supreme Court of India by

its recent judgment of Navaneethakrishnan v The State by Inspector of

Police- Criminal Appeal No. 1134 of 2013 - decided on 16.04.2018.

It is on these principles of law, the case presented by the prosecution

against the appellant must be considered and decided.

Of the many items of circumstantial evidence that had been placed

before the trial Court by the prosecution, the following are reproduced

below in a chronological sequence;

1. the appellant had continued problems with his wife since the

birth of their daughter,

ii. on the previous evening, the appellant wanted his father-in-

law to have his hand phone switched on at all the times, in

21

case he needed to call him. The appellant has never contacted

his father- in -law over the phone or made a similar request

prior to this incident.

111. appellant's neighbours woke up to screaming of a woman

coming from the appellant's house,

IV. appellant's immediate neighbour heard a crashing sound

from the kitchen and realised that the screaming woman was

running towards the front of the house,

v. appellant's wife ran out of the house and collapsed on the

road with a bleeding injury on her face,

VI. as the neighbours making preparations to transport the

injured woman to hospital, the appellant raised cries that his

daughter is cut (" ~C)C) ~gC))"),

Vll. hearing this, appellant's wife had run back into the house,

viii. as she entered the house, appellant's daughter ran out and

collapsed at the front of the house. She had a deep cut injury

on her neck,

ix. the appellant told his neighbours not to come into his house,

x. a noise, coming from the house, was heard by the neighbours

who later saw the appellant's wife lying in a pool of blood on

the floor of the kitchen. She had a gaping wound on her

forehead. A 11 @O)~ G~" was seen kept at a corner of the

appellant's kitchen, which had its door open to the back yard.

No manna knife was seen in the vicinity. 22

xi. the appellant was dressed in a paIr of shorts and was

apparently crying but did not do anything to take his wife

and daughter to hospital. He had no injuries. He told the

neighbours that he was held at gun point by the "G)zC'.5 tS)@)C)

G)z&i@)G) ~&i3:" who attacked his wife with the" @)OJ@ C<s" and

had then escaped through the back door. The appellant did

not cry out for help but on the contrary he had prevented his

neighbours coming into the house,

XlI. the neighbours who have gathered with the scream of the

woman did not see any intruder in the visinity although they

unsuccessfully mounted a search upon the appellant's claim.

The appellant's land was secured with barbed wire fence on

three sides and a 6 feet high wall at its back. His garden was

well lit. Clearly there were no signs of any forceful intrusion

into the appellant's house,

xiii. The appellant calls his father-in-law on his hand phone to

inform him of the incident,

XIV. The Police arrived at the scene and conducted their

investigations. There were blood patches in the bed room and

kitchen. Trails of blood which originated in the bed room and

leading to the front of the house were noted. Small foot prints

in blood were also noted originating from the bed room and

ending at the front of the house,

xv. the"@)oJ@ G<S" was kept in a corner of the kitchen where the

body of the woman was lying.

xvi. a faint trail of blood was seen leading to the firewood shed

from the kitchen and a blood stained manna knife was

recovered from there, kept hidden under a roofing tile upon

information provided by the appellant. Its highly probable

that the manna knife could have been used to cause fatal

injuries to the small girl. It could also have been used to cause

some of the injuries to her mother who had other injures

which may have been caused using a "pointed stake for

husking coconut" which also had a blood stained blade,

It is appropriate at this stage to consider the contention of the

learned Counsel for the appellant that the prosecution had failed to

exclude the possibility of a 3rd party involvement in the murder.

The evidence relied upon by the prosecution clearly indicated that

the neighbours who have gathered around the appellant's house were

vigilant of the appellant's claim about an attack mounted on his family

members by two assailants. They have arrived there before the death of the

daughter of the appellant and before his wife received her gaping wound

24

on her forehead. The slashing of the neck of the small girl had taken place

when the neighbours were already knew that the wife of the appellant was

attacked by someone as she ran out of the house to save her life. It could

well be due to her maternal instinct that she ran back to the house, when

the appellant had cried out that her daughter was cut. At that point of time

the neighbours have already made preparations to take the woman to a

hospital. When the child ran out of the house with the wound on her neck

and dropped dead at the gate, it is clear that her assailant was still inside

the house. The wife of the appellant had not sustained any fatal injury as

yet. The appellant did not call out for help or claimed that II (3)ZO e:i)C) (3)z&(3)

@&~:))" is killing them. Strangely he did not want any of his neighbours to

come inside of the house. At that time the prosecution witnesses have

gathered right in front of the house.

There is no possibility exists that two of the assailants getting away

through a barbed wire fence or upon scaling a 6 feet high wall without

being seen by the group of people who have gathered after the woman's

scream. They knew that some acts of deadly violence is taking place inside

the house and were on high alert. The attack on the wife of the appellant

took place in the kitchen when the neighbours have gathered around the

body of the girl. The neighbours have only seen the appellant inside the

house.

The appellant's knowledge as to place of the blood stained manna

knife could be found, a weapon which had been used to slash the neck of

the girl as per the expert evidence, which had been kept concealed under

25

set of roofing tiles, when considered in conjunction with the fact that

there was a faint trail of blood starting from the kitchen and ending at the

fire wood shed, gives rise to the reasonable inference that it was the

appellant who left this weapon there until its subsequent recovery as per

the reasoning in Ariyasinghe and Others v The Attorney General (supra).

The appellant had to put it there before the neighbours could come into his

house, who later saw his seriously wounded wife with a gaping hole on

her forehead. The neighbours were inside the house after the wife was

found in a pool of blood in the kitchen. The Police too had arrived there

soon after. After the wife was seen by the neighbours in the kitchen, the

appellant absolutely had no opportunity to put the manna knife under a

set of tiles in the firewood shed without being seen by them. The

neighbours who have already gathered in large numbers were around the

house at that time. In the circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the

appellant did not want any of them to come in before his daughter and

wife were sufficiently wounded because he is the only person inside the

house and he did not want others to see what was happening to them.

This inference is further fortified with the fact that after the initial

attack on his wife and after the slashing of the neck of his daughter the

manna knife was not used. The medical evidence is that the death of the

wife of the appellant was due to injuries that may have been caused using

a 1/ lO)@ (,@". The opening of the kitchen door is explained with the trail of

blood leading to fire wood shed. It had been kept open by the appellant to

have access to the fire wood shed in order to conceal the manna knife

after he cut his daughter's neck. He was only left with 1/ lO)@ Os" as a 26

weapon when his wife returned to the house unexpectedly. Clearly the

kitchen door was not left open by the alleged assailants to make their

getaway after the attack but by the appellant himself in his attempt to

conceal the manna knife.

The appellant's claim of the involvement of II G)zQ C)C) GlziDGl ~iD{5:))"

is clearly a fiction he created unsuccessfully to ward off suspicion that

would otherwise have justifiably pinned on him. The appellant had the

motive, opportunity and the ability to carry out the attack on the two

deceased. His claim of attack on his wife at the kitchen and not at the bed

room does not fit in with the observation of several large blood patches

inside the bed room.

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court confirms that it did

consider the claim of 3rd party involvement in great detail.

The appeal of the appellant revolves around an interesting question

of law. The prosecution presented a case based on items of circumstantial

evidence against him. The prosecution sought the trial Court to draw an

inescapable and irresistible inference on the guilt of the appellant of the

two murders on those items of circumstantial evidence.

The appellant, on the other hand relied on his alleged eye witness

account of the sequence of events culminating with the deaths of his wife

and daughter. It is his position that the husband of the woman who

operated a gas distribution depot in the company of another stranger, had

attacked them in his presence injuring them fatally after having entered

their house that night surreptitiously. This attack, the appellant claimed, 27

was due to a previous incident of assault by his wife on the said woman

who operated a gas depot, upon an allegation of financial fraud.

It is clear that, therefore the appellant did not rely on any of the

items of circumstantial evidence that had been placed before the trial

Court by the prosecution, in order to substantiate his version of events. As

already noted he relied on his eye witness account by which he adduced

direct evidence in support of his position.

The trial Court had correctly rejected his evidence.

In the appeal, the appellant did not challenge the decision of the trial

Court, in rejecting his evidence. Instead, he now seeks to impress upon this

Court that certain items of circumstantial evidence that had been

presented by the prosecution, supports an inference of a 3rd party

involvement in the alleged crime and therefore he is entitled to the benefit

of the said alternative inference which made the inference of guilt that had

been drawn against him by the trial Court is not the" irresistible, necessary

and inescapable inference guilt" as required by law, in order to found him

guilty in a case based on circumstantial evidence.

A similar contention has been considered in an English judgment of

R v Danells [2006] EWCA Crim 628 by Lord Kay. The contention before

their Lordships was" ... the prosecution evidence, taken at its highest, is such

that a jury properly directed could not properly convict on it because the

circumstances, whilst consistent with the prosecution case, are also consistent

with the defence case as disclosed in interview by the appellant."

28

Their Lordships have dismissed the appeal by rejecting this

contention, after considering the passages from the speech of Steyn LJ in

Moore (unreported, 92/2101.Y3, 20 August 1992) where it is said that in

order to succeed, the appellant's position should be " equally possible" and

since the inference' sought to be drawn on behalf of the appellant in that

instance is a " ... certainly a possible inference but it would be a logical jump to

say that it was the only reasonable inference" .

The speech of Lord Morris in Mcgreevy v DPP [1973] 1 WLR 276,

which states that;

"It requires no more than ordinary common sense for a

jury to understand if one suggested inference from an

accepted piece of evidence leads to a conclusion of guilt

and another suggested inference to a conclusion of

innocence a jury could not on that piece of evidence

alone be satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt

unless they wholly rejected and excluded the latter

suggestion ",

This part of the speech was considered by Lord Kay in Dannels and

recognising that Lord Morris's said statement" ... gave birth to the standard

direction on circumstantial evidence which is advised by the Judicial Studies

Board". The pronouncement of Steyn LJ is that the inference invited on

behalf of the appellant in Moore was a" ... reasonable one about one which any

jury, properly directed, would bound to have a doubt".

29

Reverting to the appeal before us, the inference that should be drawn

upon the items of circumstantial evidence as invited by the appellant on

the involvement of a 3rd party in the crime, should be a " ... reasonable one

about one which any jury properly directed would bound to have a doubt".

Whether the said contention of the appellant did satisfy the said test is the

issue we must consider next.

The prosecution, through its witnesses had adequately explained the

improbability of the claim of the appellant that it was the husband of the

woman who operated the gas distribution depot, who is responsible for

the two murders. The appellant's evidence on that too had been rightly

rejected.

In these circumstances, learned Counsel for the appellant now seeks

to highlight the fact that the prosecution has failed to explain the presence

of a pair of slippers and a blood stained sarong at the scene of crime and

therefore the said failure should be resolved in his favour. It is also her

contention that in order to exclude the person from the gas depot from the

accusation levelled by the appellant, he should have been called by the

prosecution as a witness.

The blood stained pair of slippers and a sarong that were noted by

IP Doole does not justify inferring that it belongs to the assassin who

attacked the two deceased that night. Doole concedes that he did not

conduct investigations as to the ownership of the slippers whether it

belonged to the wife of the deceased, the appellant or any other. There was

30

no suggestion to the witness that the appellant pointed to them as the pair

of slippers belonged to the assassin who murdered his wife by attacking

her with a spiked instrument. The blood stained sarong was seen inside

the bed room. The bed room floor was stained with patches of blood.

There is nothing unusual about finding a sarong inside the appellant's bed

room and its blood stains could easily be explained due to the amount of

blood that were found inside the room. The only individuals who could

testify before the trial Court as to whether these two items are not of the

inmates but the appellant and his wife. His wife is not among the living

and the appellant remained silent on this issue.

The failure to call the alleged murderer, as per the position taken up

by the appellant, has little or no significance to the instant appeal, in view

of the circumstances that were presented before the trial Court. The direct

evidence of such an involvement of a 3rd party had been rejected and the

alternate interference that could be drawn from the items of circumstantial

evidence that were highlighted by the appellant clearly failed to satisfy the

test as enunciated by Moore.

After a careful consideration of the evidence before the trial Court

as a whole, we are satisfied that they easily satisfy the requirements as laid

down by the superior Courts in the judicial precedents referred to above.

Therefore, we are convinced that the facts proved by the prosecution are

quite sufficient to draw the "one and only irresistible and inescapable

inference" as to the guilt of the appellant and that they are inconsistent with

his innocence.

31

In conclusion we hold that the several grounds of appeal, as raised

by the learned Counsel, are without any merit. The conviction and

sentence of the appellant is affirmed by this Court and therefore his appeal

stands dismissed.
