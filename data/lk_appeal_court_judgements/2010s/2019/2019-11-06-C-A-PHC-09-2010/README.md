Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application in the High Court of Kegalle

on 15.05.2009 against the Pradeshiya Sabha of Mawanella

seeking to quash by way of writ of certiorari the Gazette

Notification dated 18.07.2008 marked P3. The respondent filed

objections to this application. After the argument, followed by

filing written submissions, the High Court dismissed the

petitioners application on several grounds. This appeal by the

petitioner is against the said Judgment.

By the said Gazette, the disputed road, namely, Ananda

Maithriya Mawatha, was published as a Pradeshiya Sabha road,

in terms of section 24 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, No.15 of

1987. It was further stated in the Gazette itself that, any party

who objects to it, can take steps, in terms of section 24(2) of the

Pradeshiya Sabha Act, within one month from the date of the

Gazette.

Section 24(2) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act reads as follows:

Upon the publication of such notices any party claiming to

be the owner of land from which such road or path has

been demarcated shall within the time prescribed by such

notice institute action in the appropriate court for

establishing his title to such land.

The petitioner with his counter affidavit has tendered a letter

marked A dated 10.08.2008 addressed to the Pradeshiya

Sabha objecting to the said course of action of the Pradeshiya

Sabha.

The Pradeshiya Sabha has in their written submission tendered

to the High Court disputed this letter, if I understand correctly,

as a forgery.1 That matter cannot be decided in these

proceedings.

Even if it is not a forgery, according to section 24(2), what the

objecting party shall do is, not to write to the Pradeshiya Sabha

within the time prescribed by such Notice, but to institute an

action in the District Court to establish his title to such land.

This has not been done. Nor has any reason been adduced in

the petition for failure to do it.

The petitioner has filed this writ application challenging the

Gazette on 15.05.2009, that is, about 10 months after the

publication of the Notice in the Gazette. The petitioner has not

mentioned a word about this inordinate delay in the petition,

which, in my view, is fatal to the application. A person who

seeks a discretionary remedy such as a writ, shall act in

promptitude, and come to Court with least possible delay.

I am unable to accept the argument of the petitioner that, as the

Gazette Notification is illegal, delay is not a bar to the

maintainability of the application. The Gazette Notification is

not ex facie illegal or perverse. Such a strong position has not

been taken up in the petition. Hence the applicant for writ shall

pass the threshold test to proceed further. In my view, in the

facts and circumstances of this case, the petitioner has not

satisfied the threshold requirement.

The petitioner has explained the basis upon which he challenges

the Gazette Notification in paragraph 17 of the petition. The

main complaint of the petitioner is the violation of the principles

of natural justice. This question does not arise as the Gazette

Notification does not constitute a determination of the

Pradeshiya Sabha, which could be amenable to writ jurisdiction.

That Notice under section 24(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act is,

in my view, investigative in character. That was statutorily open

to challenge in the District Court.

The fact that section 24(1) is investigative in character is

manifest by reading subsections (3)-(5) of section 24, which spell

out the subsequent steps to be taken including further Notices

to be published, before such roads become vested in the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

This is akin to Section 2 Notice of the Land Acquisition Act. It

has been held by our Courts that seeking writ of certiorari to

5

quash Section 2 Notice of the Land Acquisition Act is premature

and not ripe for review.2

The Pradeshiya Sabha by tendering several documents has

informed Court that the disputed road has been using by the

villagers for some time, and the Gazette Notification was

published upon the consent of the Viharadhipathy of the temple,

namely, Rev. Meththananda.3 The road runs through the

temple property. The petitioner does not accept Rev.

Meththananda as the Viharadhipathy. The petitioner says that

he is the Viharadhipathy. These are disputed facts which

cannot be resolved in a writ application.

On that basis the Pradeshiya Sabha challenges the locus standi

of the petitioner to file this application.

Affidavits of a number of villagers have been tendered by the

Pradeshiys Sabha stating the necessity of this road. The

Pradeshiya Sabha also states that this road has been in

existence for a long time, and in support of it has inter alia

tendered V16 (a photograph of a wedding couple walking along

this road with the relations) and V17 (the Marriage Certificate of

them) to prove that it was there at least from October 2003.

Conversely, the petitioner has not tendered a single affidavit

from a villager in support of his application.

Writ is a discretionary as well as equitable remedy. A party

cannot ask for a writ as of right.

Taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I take the

view that the dismissal of the petitioners application by the High

Court is justifiable.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
