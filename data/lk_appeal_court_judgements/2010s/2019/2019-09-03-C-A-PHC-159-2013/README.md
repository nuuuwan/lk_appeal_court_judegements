A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

preferred this appeal to sct aside the decision of the High Court of the Southern

Province holden in Hambantota, dated 24/09/20 l3, inter alia, upholding the

decision by the 9'h Respondent to terminate the employment of the Appellant with

effect from 13/03/2009, marked P5.

According to the Petition, the Appellant while servmg as a teacher in

"Udamaththala School in the IIambantota district along with several other

students, teachers and parents had gone to see a film, where it was alleged that the

Appellant. while watching the film committed sexual abuse to the virtual

complainant student who was seated next to him. The Appellant was suspended

from his employment on l3/03/20 19, and was charged under 3 counts. Consequent

to a disciplinary inquiry, the 9th Respondent found the Appellant guilty of the 1st

and 3rd counts, which resulted in the termination of his employment. The

Appellant thereafter preferred an appeal against the said decision to the Public

Services Commission. Southern Province, (7'h Respondent). By letter dated

06/05/201 I, marked P8, the Appellant was informed that the appeal was

dismissed. Against the said decision the Appellant preferred an appeal to the

Governor of the Southern Province (I sl Respondent), which was also dismissed by

the decision reflected in document marked PI O.

7

The Appellant is seeking to quash the documents marked P5, P8, and P 10

by way of writ of Certiorari and has further sought a writ of Mandamus

compelling the 8th Respondent to reinstate the Appellant in his position with back

wages or legally offer him retirement.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant listed the following grounds for

consideration;

1. The learned High Court Judge has taken into consideration the finding of guilt

of the Appellant at the disciplinary inquiry by the 9th Respondent, which is

illegal and procedurally improper, thus, cannot stand in law.

2. The learned High Court Judge has not taken into consideration whether the

decisions reflected in documents marked P8 and PI 0 are contrary to the

principles of natural justice or whether the Respondents have acted ultra vires.

3. The delegation of authority to the 8th Respondent as per Section 5:1 of Chapter

48 in Volume II of the Establishment Code, has not been duly made.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has drawn attention of Court to the

statement made by the virtual complainant student (aggrieved student), marked

document No.1, at the preliminary investigation, where she has stated that she was

sexually harassed by the Appellant. The aggrieved student was called as a witness

on several occasions, but has failed to participate in the disciplinary inquiry. In the

absence of the aggrieved student, the statement given by her has been adopted at

8

the inquiry. The contention of the Counsel for the Appellant is that the adoption

and/or admission of the said statement at the disciplinary inquiry is contrary to the

provisions of Section 2 1(\3) read with Section 21(3) of Chapter XLVIII of the

Establishment Code. (Code).

Section 21:3 of the Code reads as follows;

"The Tribunal may, depending on the nature of the charges, arrive at a

decision on documentary evidence alone. Similarly, the tribunal may

arrive at a decision on oral evidence alone or on both documentary

and oral evidence led before the tribunal. "

Section 21: 13 .of the Code reads as follows;

"Where a witness accepts that a written statement made by him at a

preliminary investigation is true, matters contained in such statement

will be accepted as evidence led at the formal disciplinary inquiry. "

Section 21: 1 0 of the Code states;

"The Tribunal should direct itself by the best evidence which it. can

procure or which is led before it, whether or not such evidence is

admissible in a Court of Law. "

Relying on Section 21:3 and Section 21: 1 0 of the Code, the learned

Counsel for the Respondents argued that. the Establishment Code permits the

9

disciplinary authority to rely on statements made in the preliminary investigation

and therefore, the statement given by the aggrieved student is admitted evidence at

the hearing which can be relied upon by the Tribunal as best evidence.

Section 21 :25 of the Code reads as follows;

"The Tribunal may refer to any document even though it has not been

produced in evidence, which assists it in arriving at a decision.

Nevertheless, such a document should not properly be regarded as

evidence. "

Therefore, the Tribunal is also empowered to refer to any document even

though, it has not been produced in evidence.

Since the aggrieved student did not participate in the disciplinary inquiry,

her statement at the preliminary investigatiun was marked OIS, through a witness.

In terms of Section 21: 13 of the Code, where a witness accepts that a written

statement made by such witness at a preliminary investigation is true, matters

contained in such a statement. will be accepted as evidence. When a statement of a

witness is produced in evidence the truthfulness of the contents of the statement

would be best kn'own to the person who made the statement. Therefore, it is vital

to evaluate the ~redibili):y of the contents as contemplated by the said Section,

from the p.ersoll who made the statement" in order to formally adopt the contents

as evidence.

10

In support of the above contention the Appellant has cited John Keels Ltd.

v. Ceylon Mercantile Industrial and General Workers Union and others (2006) 1

SLR 48, where Sri Skandarajah, J. held that,

"A charge against a person has to be proved by direct evidence. But the

rules of evidence provided in the Evidence Ordinance permit evidence led in

a former judicial proceedings to be led in a subsequent judicial proceeding

in exceptional circumstances where the witness cannot be found or cannot

be brought without unreasonable delay or expenses or the witness is

prevented from giving evidence. Even though the Evidence Ordinance is not

strictly applicable to inquiries held under the Industrial Dispute Act, the

principle behind the admissibility of evidence should be borne in mind in

accepting such evidence. The purpose of leading direct evidence is to test

the credibility of a witness and to test the truthfulness of the facts given by

the witness when giving evidence. If this opportunity is denied to a tribunal

then only on exceptional circumstances, it can accept evidence subject to the

aforesaid test. "

The charges preferred against the Appellant are very serious in nature. The

Respondents relied on the contents of the statement made by the aggrieved student

at the disciplinary inquiry and thl;: statement made to the Police, both marked in

evidence as incriminating evidence against the Appellant, in the absence of any

other evidence. independent or otherwise. The Counsel for the Appellant has

11

drawn attention of Court to certain inconsistencies in the two statements given by

the aggrieved student which questions the admissibility of the said evidence.

As required by the Code, if a witness is not present before the Tribunal it is

incumbent upon the Tribunal to be satisfied that the contents of the statement is

true, before adopting such evidence at the inquiry. In the instant case, the

acceptanct: of the statement should have been by the aggrieved student, or at the

least, by a parent, a guardian or for reasons given by the investigating authority of

non-participation of the aggrieved student at the inquiry. The Respondent has

failed to call any witness to substantiate the absence of the aggrieved student.

The Appellant has also brought to the attention of Court that the ISland 7th

Respondents have violated the Appellants right to be heard, before the decisions

reflected in letter marked PIO and P8, respectively were given, which the

Appellant contends are contrary to the principles of Natural Justice.

The 7tl1 Respondent's letter marked P8, reflected the decision given by the

Provincial Public Service Commission (PPSC), which dismissed the appeal of the

Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said decision the Appellant has appealed to the

Governor of the Southern Province, (l51 Respondent). As reflected in the

impugned document marked P 10, the 1

51 Respondent has arrived at her decision

after a discussion with the 2"d to 7'h Respondents. The decisions given by the said

Respondents were challenged before the 1

51 Respondent. The Appellant submits

12

that when a committee fonned by the I st Respondent which includes the 2nd to 7'h

Respondents, who held against the Appellant, a main limb of Natural Justice, that

is, nemo judex in causa sua (No man may be a judge in his own case), the rule

against bias has been breached. The Appellant also contends that in the

circumstances, the denial of a hearing to the Appellant before the I st Respondent is

contrary to all basic principles of Natural Justice.

Before a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, a right to a hearing would

nonnally entail the right to an oral hearing and in certain circumstances even the

right to representation (Fernando v. University o/Ceylon (J956) 58 NLR 265). The

underlining presumption is that a person must be given an opportunity to reply to

an allegation brought against him.

In the instant case the Appellant appealed to the I st Respondent against the

decision given by the 7th Respondent. The 1st Respondent based her findings

contained in document PIO, upon consulting a committee consisting of the 7th

Respondent among others, of a decision made by the 7"' Respondent, reflected in

document marked P8, which was based on the findings of the 2nd to 6th

Respondents. Tn the circumstances, the committee fonned by the I st Respondent in

appeal, cannot be seen to be above suspicion of not having an interest in the

subject matter, which is contrary to the principles of Natural Justice. A mere

appearance of bias itsel f, is sufficient to question the impartiality of a Tribunal.

13

By way of further written submissions, the Respondents "additionally

urging as yet another ground inter alia, for dismissing the above styled appeal of

the Appellant", for not exhausting an alternate remedy provided by the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution which provides the Appellant a right of appeal to

the Public Service Commission. It is admitted by the Counsel for the Respondent

that the said legal submission is made in addition to the submissions made in the

Provincial High Court of Hambantota.

A Court may in its discretion refuse to grant permiSSIOn to apply for

judicial review if an adequate alternate remedy exists. The rule is not a rigid one.

If the applicant s.atisfies the Court that the decision has been made without

jurisdiction or in, complete disregard of the rules of natural justice, the writs will

lie even though an alternative remedy is available. "A writ of Certiorari was

granted to quash the award of an arbitrator made in flagrant excess of his

statutory jurisdiction under the Co-operative Societies Ordinance even though an

alternative remedy was available under the Ordinance ". (Sirisena v. Kotawera-

Udugama Co-operative Stores Ltd. (1949) 51 N.L.R. 262).

The Court would generally exercise its discretion taking into consideration,

inter alia, the time limits, public interest, the extent to which questions of

procedural error or breach of natural justice arise or deciding that the merits of the

case should be heard at the outset. Therefore, discretion should be exercised by a

Court at the initial stage taking into consideration the factual matters in a given

14

application. However, when exerting discretion of Court "the position is not as

straightforward as the diclQ suggest ". (See Judicial remedies in Public Law 5th

Edition, Lewis, at page 431-432).

The Respondents for reasons best known to them, chose not to raise the

issue of the availability as an alternate remedy and participated in the proceedings

before the Provincial High Court.

The Ha/sbury's Laws of Ellg/alld, 5th Ed. Vol 19 states as follows:

"An appilcation to challenge the jurisdiction of the court must be made

at the outset of the proceedings, for if the defendant takes any step in the

proceedings other than a step to challenge the jurisdiction, he will be

taken to have waived any opportunity for challenge which he might

otherwise have had, and to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the

court. "

[n To/ago/a v. Gallgodawi/a Co-operative Stores Society Ltd. 48 NLR 472

at 474 it was held;

"Where the question raised for the first time in appeal, however, .is a

pure qlles~ion oflrlw, and is not a mixed question of law and jact, it can

be dealt with. "

15

As noted earlier, the question of availability of an alternate remedy is a

discretionary remedy exercised, taking into consideration mixed questions of fact

and law in each particular case. Therefore, an objection of this nature, which goes

to the root of the case should be taken up at the earliest possible opportunity. The

Respondents did not raise this issue at any time during the proceedings before the

Provincial High Court.

Therefore, by not raising an objection of availability of an alternate remedy

before the Provincial High Court and participating in the hearing, the Respondents

in the process have acquiesced to waive their right to raise the said objection.

Therefore, the Respondents are estopped from raising the said objection at this

stage, before this Court.

F or all the above reasons, I find that the conviction of the Appellant to the

I Sl and 3rd charges at the diSCiplinary inquiry held by the 9th Respondent cannot

stand in law due to procedural irregularity and impropriety. Therefore, I find that

sufficient grounds exist to quash the decisions given by the Respondents reflected

in PS, P8 and PIO, due to the Appellant been denied of the rules of Natural Justice.

Since the merits of this case would df':cide the application before Court, it is

not necessary to deal with the 3rd ground of appeal raised by the Appellant.

16

The grounds for the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus as prayed for has not

been made out in the Petition nor in the subm iss ions made by the Appellant at the

argument stage and theretore, the said relief is denied.

Accordingly, I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated

24/0912013, and grand relief to the Appellant by issuing a mandate in the nature of

Writ of Certiorari to quash the determination reflected in P5, P8 and PIO as

prayed for in the prayer to the Petition.

Appeal allowed without costs.
