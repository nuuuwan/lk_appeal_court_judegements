ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Avissavella

along with another accused for committing robbery of a three wheeler and

for the murder of Magammanage Niroshan on or about 05.05.2002 at

Avissavella.

On 10.09.2010, after an inquiry under Section 241 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 the trial Court made order to

proceed with the trial against the appellant in absentia.

2

At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, the judgment of the trial

Court was pronounced on 24.01.2013 and the appellant was convicted on

both counts. He was sentenced to 7 years R.I. in respect of the first count

while death sentence was pronounced on account of the second count.

Thereafter an open warrant was issued on the appellant by the trial Court.

The appellant was arrested and produced before the trial Court on

17.06.2013. Upon an. application made under Section 241(3) by the

appellant, an inquiry was conducted by the trial Court. During this

inquiry, the appellant, his brother-in-law and his son gave evidence in

support of his position that he did not receive any communication from

Court. The prosecution called a former neighbour of the appellant, sister of

his 2nd wife and Grama Niladhari of the area and the police officer who

served process in support of their position that the appellant was

absconding, having left his last known address nine years ago.

The trial Court, having considered the evidence that had been

placed before it by the contesting parties, made its order on 25.05.2016,

refusing the appellant's application to set aside his conviction that had

been entered in his absence and to hold his trial de novo.

The appellant, by his petition of appeal on 31.05.2016 had invoked

appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to have his conviction set aside.

In support of the said appeal, learned Counsel for the appellant

however submitted to this Court that;

a. the order of the trial Court dated 10.09.2010 to proceed in absentia

against the appellant is bad in law since the trial Court relied on

hearsay material during the inquiry under Section 241(1), 3

b. the order of the trial Court dated 25.05.2016 is clearly erroneous

as it failed to note that the prosecution has failed to tender the

If summons report through the police officer who delivered summons

to the accused by calling him to give evidence."

The relief prayed by the appellant upon invoking the appellate

jurisdiction of this Court could be roughly translated to read as alter the

verdict of guilty to a verdict of not guilty (" O)) C)zo~ O)OlG)l 8 ~ GlO) dO@)6)G)

@a~c5 @O))() .tDalo~O)ol G)l8 dO@)6)G) O)O~ @@O"). Clearly the appellant seeks to

challenge the conviction that had been entered against him by the High

Court of Avissavella with his petition of appeal.

The said conviction was entered against the appellant on 24.01.2013

and the petition of appeal of the appellant is dated 31.05.2016. It was

endorsed by the Prison Authorities on 01.06.2016. The said petition of

appeal was received by the Registry of the High Court on 08.06.2016 as per

the journal entry of that day.

Section 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, whilst conferring

a right of appeal upon an aggrieved person to lodge an appeal to the

Registrar of the High Court "within fourteen days from the date when the

conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced, ... ".

In this instance, the appellant, although seeks to appeal against his "verdict

of guilty" I did not lodge an appeal within the stipulated fourteen-day

period. His appeal has been filed after a lapse of more than forty months

since his conviction. Therefore, the petition of appeal of the appellant is

clearly filed out of time as per Rajapakse v The State (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 161

and owing to this reason, it ought to be dismissed.

4

There is no appeal (if there is such a right) lodged by the appellant

against the order made by the High Court on his application under Section

241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The appellant failed to move

in revision of the said order either. In these circumstances, the submissions

made by the learned Counsel on his behalf could not be considered since

there is no basis for its consideration.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in her reply, relied on the

judgment of this Court in CA Appeal No. 155/00 - decided on 17.09.2007

where Ranjith Silva J has considered the scope of Sections 241(3) and 331(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 in view of a

preliminary objection taken on behalf of the Attorney General.

In the said judgment, it was held that;

" ... the High Court judge has rejected the explanation of the

appellant and refused to vacate the conviction and the

sentence. There had been no application for revision and the

appellant had the opportunity of moving in revision. On the

other hand, if we are to allow this application it 'would

amount to condescending or the Court lending its hand, to a

person guilty of contumacious conduct and thereby assisting

him. We are of the opinion that the discretionary power of

this Court invoking the revisionary jurisdiction should not

be used in a situation of this sort. Therefore, we hold that the

petition of appeal is not properly constituted and is out of

time. There is no right of appeal against the against the order

made on the 06.01.2002 under Section 241(3) because

Section 331 gives only the forum jurisdiction. We have

5

perused chapter XVIII (F) under the Heading of The trial in

the High Court in the absence of the accused and we find

that there is no provision made for appeals against the orders

made under Section 241 (3) "vide Martin v

Wijewardene(1989) 2 Sri L.R. 409."

In any event, the record bears the fact that the appellant was

committed by the Magistrate's Court on 24.09.2006. He was not successful

in obtaining bail from the High Court and therefore the learned

Magistrate, while making order remanding him after the committal, has

also ordered him to appear before the High Court when noticed, if he was

granted bail at a subsequent stage. The relevant part of the very

descriptive order made by the learned Magistrate is reproduced below;

1/(1) a~ ~~(5)() ~)aO)c~cl ~9 0~)(3)0 C'.jt;~) O)zt;B (gzQ)~ (5)O, ~j

oo03a ~0)030) 00 g~o."

Mysteriously the appellant claims that he was II released" by the

Prison Authorities from this prosecution and he thought that his release

was due to his matter reaching its conclusion as indicative by his release

6

from remand without even applying for bail. He stated to High Court

during the inquiry that he regularly visited his last known address but

never served with any notice to appear before the High Court.

The appellant had a series of cases pending against him at that time

and it is evident that he was quite familiar with the criminal justice process

due to his exposure to Court procedure with these several prosecutions.

He knew what to do when a warrant was issued and has obtained bail in

some other cases. The "release" from the prosecution and that too by the

Prison Authorities and not by any Court of law makes his explanation far

from being one made in bona fide.

Even if there was an application for revision against the said order,

powers of revision being a discretionary remedy, the appellant is unlikely

to obtain relief as the Supreme Court in Sudhannan de Silva v The

Attorney General (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 9, distinguished the entitlement under a

right and entitlement under a discretionary remedy with its statement of

law that;

" ... Contumacious conduct on the part of the applicant

is a relevant consideration when the exercise of a

discretion in his favour is involved, but not when he

asserts his statutory right to appeal and is not asking for

the favou r of any permission".

7

The trial Court was mindful of the applicable law under Section

241(3) when it considered the applicant's explanation in support of his

application, in order to determine whether it is a bona fide one and had

correctly decided that it is not.

In view of the above considerations, the appeal of the appellant is

dismissed as it is filed out of time.
