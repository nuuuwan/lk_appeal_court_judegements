Decided on: 10.09.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner being a limited liability company filed this writ

application against several Respondents including Mayor of

Anuradhapura, Divisional Secretary, General Manager of

3

Railways, Officer In Charge of Anuradhapura Police Station,

Director of Provincial Urban Development Authority, Provincial

Land Commissioner, Surveyor General seeking several reliefs on

the basis that notwithstanding the 1st-3rd Respondents are in

unlawful occupation of State Lands including 30 foot roadway1,

the 4th-12th Respondents do not enforce the law to eject them.

The Petitioner is a sub-lessee2 of one Rizvi to whom the subject

land (Lot 924) was given on a long-term lease by the State3. The

sub-lease, according to P10, is to expire by the year 2025.

The 1st-3rd Respondents, according to the Plans prepared by the

Surveyor General for the purpose of this case marked 12R1-

12R3, living on State Lands, which include Railway Reservation

to the east of Lot 924, having built permanent houses thereon.

These are, no doubt, unauthorized dwelling houses.

It appears that the authorities including the Divisional Secretary

are not keen to eject those unlawful occupiers by resorting to

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act or any other Statute for

reasons best known to them.

Then the question is whether this Court can compel the

authorities by way of mandamus to evict those unlawful

occupiers. This Court is aware that the State can regularize

unlawful occupation provided the occupiers fulfil the conditions

in the laid down procedure. I do not think that this Court can

compel the authorities to evict only the 1st-3rd Respondents as

1 Vide Plan P8. 2 Vide P10. 3 Vide P9.

4

unlawful occupiers of State Land using State machinery when

there are a number of unlawful occupiers in the neighborhood.

However, there is one matter which concerns me. It appears by

reading P9 and by looking at the addresses of the parties

(subject to correction) that this area, where Lot 924 and the

houses of 1st-3rd Respondents stand on, is in the Industrial

Zone. The land has been given to Rizvi on a long-lease only to

utilize for industrial purposes and not for residential purposes.

The land is now being used by the Petitioner for industrial

purpose, to be specific, to conduct the business of operating a

garage (mechanical workshop). If it is in the Industrial Zone, it is

not clear how to regularize the unlawful occupants for

residential purposes. Such a step not only be ill-conceived, but

also seems to me (subject to correction) to be against the Law.

As arguments in that line were not presented, I do not wish to

make any specific finding on that matter, and leave that matter

open to be decided probably in a future litigation.

The next matter to be considered is what prompted the

Petitioner to file this action. That is to seek redress to resolve a

private dispute between the 1st-3rd Respondents on one hand

and the Petitioner on the other. The Petitioner says that the 1st-

3rd Respondents always disturb the smooth functioning of the

motor vehicle garage business in his Lot No. 924 by various

means including pelting stones to his side on the basis that the

operation of the garage is a health hazard to their families and

also nuisance to them. On the other hand, it is the position of

the Petitioner that the presence of 1st-3rd Respondents is a

nuisance to the Petitioner. In the facts of this case, I am not

5

convinced that the Petitioner has filed this action as a public-

spirited person concerned to see that the law is obeyed in the

interest of all.4

In Weligama Multi Co-operative Society v. Daluwatte5, Full Bench

of the Supreme Court held that writ will not issue for private

purposes.

The Petitioner has not shown to the satisfaction of the Court

that he has a legal right to the performance of the legal duty by

the 4th-12th Respondents to evict the 1st-3rd unlawful occupiers

from the adjoining State Land when the law provides under

certain conditions for regularizing unlawful occupation of State

Lands. There is no legal duty on the part of the 4th-12th

Respondents to compulsorily eject all the unlawful occupants

from State Lands including the 1st-3rd Respondents. The

situation might be different if they unlawfully reside in an

Industrial Zone whilst being a nuisance to legitimate businesses

carried on in the Zone. Hence the Court expects that the

authorities will act responsibly.

When the authorities give State Lands with specific directions to

use for industrial purposes, it is the duty of the relevant officials

to facilitate them to carry out their businesses without

hindrances from unlawful occupiers.

As public law remedy in my view is not available to the Petitioner

in the manner the case was presented before Court, I dismiss

the application of the Petitioner without costs.

This shall not prevent the Petitioner from resorting to any other

legal remedy in order to seek redress.
