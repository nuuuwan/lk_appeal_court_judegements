18.07.2018

cr he Plaintiff instituted this action for the recovery from the Defendant bank a sum of eJ Rs.1,76S,34Sr due to the Plaintiff Provincial Council on a letter of guarantee

No.22/02 dated 17.06.1991 issued by the Defendant. bank in favour of the Plaintiff

provincial Council. Thesf reliefs have been prayed for in prayers 1 and 2 of the plaint.

The letter of guarantee was marked as PI and is admitted. The Defendant bank marked

the original of the guarantee as en.

The contention of the Defendant bank has been that the said letter of guarantee

automatically ceased to be valid after 31.10.1991. Another contention is that the Plaintiff

by letter dated 18.11.199) ot9 withdrew the claim made by it upon the said letter of

guarantee by its letter dated 24.10.1991 (P2) the Defendant further contended that the

said letter of guarantee w.q.s not extended after 31/12/1991 and therefore the Plaintiff has

no cause of action against the Defendant bank.

On the contrary the Plaintiff contended that the letter of guarantee PI was duly extended

for a period of two months after 31.12.1991. On the 31.12.1991 the Plaintiff Provincial

Council made a valid demand on the Defendant bank through the Plaintiff's lawyer (PI2)

for the said sum of Rs.1,76S,34Sr. The Defendant bank was requested to pay this sum on

or before 31.12.1991 while the Defendant bank has failed to do so it has even failed to reply

2

to the letter of 21.12.1991 (P12). The Plaintiff therefore argued that the Defendant bank

was bound and obliged in law honor the said guarantee PI.

. , Let me indulge in a narrative of facts to acquaint oneself with the nitty~gritty of this case.

The Plaintiff Provincial Council entered into a contract bearing No.87/G/01 dated

10.10.1990 with a contractor called Cashian Herath who had been carrying on the

business of a building contractor under the name style and firm of Cashian & Sons. This

contract was entered into for the purpose of constructing an office complex for the

Integrated Rural Development project at Nuwara Eliya which is a project funded by the

Netherlands Government. The contract was for a sum of Rs.5,429,795/- and was to be

completed by 30th June 1991.

The contractor Cashian Herath failed to dischargi~ and complete his contractual

obligations by 30th June 1991 and requested the Plaintiff to grant an extension of time to

complete the work. The Flaintiff granted an extension to the contractor till 3pt October

1991 to complete the work subject to certain conditions one of which was that the

contractor should provid::: an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee for a sum of

Rs.1,765,345/~ which was the amount advanced to the contractor as an advance on the

said contract by the Plaintiff.

At the request of the said contractor Cashian Herath, the Defendant bank furnished to

the Plaintiff the letter of guarantee PI executed at Nuwara Eliya.

MATERIAL FACTS TO THE ISSUE TO BE DETERMINED IN THIS CASE

The contractor Cashian Herath was unable to complete the work by 3pt October 1991 as

undertaken by him and the Plaintiff by letter dated 24.10.1191 (P2) duly made the

demand on the guarantee from the bank for Rs.1,765,345/-.

It was at this stage that Cashian Herath on 28th October 1991 filed an application in the

Court of Appeal No.924/I'991 for a temporary injunction against the Central Provincial

Council, the Chief Secretary of the Central Provincial Council and the Project Director of

the Integrated Rural Development Project under Article 143 of the Constitution

restraining them from making any demand from the Defendant bank for the said sum of 3

Rs.1,76S,34S/~ under the said letter of guarantee for a period of six weeks to enable the

said Cashian Herath to iL~stitute action against the Provincial Council after giving due

notice of action. The petition and affidavit filed in the Court of Appeal application

No.924/1991 have been marked as P3 and P4.

The Registrar of the Court of Appeal had granted Cashian Herath an injunction

operative till 28.11.1991 restraining the Central Provincial Council the Plaintiff in this

case and the other Resp:Jndents referred to above frlJm demanding payment from the

Defendant bank under. the said letter of guarantee and from receiving payment

thereunder. The said fax, was marked as PS and \vas received by the Plaintiff on

30.10.1991.

On receipt of the said faxPS the Plaintiff wrote to the Manager of the Defendant bank at

Nuwara Eliya two letters both dated 30.101991.

a. By a letter marked P6 the Plaintiff intimatt;d to the Defendant bank of the

restraining order against the Plaintiff made by the Court of Appeal and requested

that the said lettel" of guarantee be extended for a further period of two months

ending 31.12.1991 as per paras 8 and 9 of the letter of guarantee.

b. By the second letter P7 the Plaintiff requested the defendant bank to suspend

further action on the letter of 24.10.1991 by vvhich the Plaintiff had made a demand

of the Defendant bank in view of the restraining order of the Court of Appeal and

referred to above until a settlement from the Court of Appeal was determined.

Having received P6 and 'P7, the Defendant bank through its legal officer disp:atched a

letter dated 11.11.1991 (PSrto the Plaintiff wherein the bank informs the Plaintiff that if it

Were to accede to the Plaintiff's request to extend th\~ bank guarantee for a further two

months, the Plaintiff must make an express withdra\val of the claim made on the bank

under the guarantee (PI). The bank further stated in this letter (PS) if there was no

withdrawal of the claim, It would not be possible for the bank to extend the validity of

the guarantee.

4

It is pertinent to observe that this letter (P8) gives an express and clear undertaking by

the Defendant bank to the Plaintiff that if the claim was withdrawn by the Plaintiff, the

guarantee would be extended for a further two mmiths. No other consideration was , insisted upon for the extension of the guarantee (PI) by the Defendant bank.

In response to this letter P8 the Plaintiff by its letter dated 18.11.1991 wrote to the

Defendant bank that the Plaintiff was withdrawing its, demand on the guarantee (PI) by

its letter dated 24.10.1991 (P2).

At this stage I would observe that the Defendant bank wrote to the Plaintiff by P8

promising to extend the bank guarantee provided the Plaintiff withdrew its demand on

the Bank guarantee made on 24.10.1991. The Plaintiff acted upon this promise and

withdrew its claim by its letter dated 18.11.1991. But ;it is pertinent to observe that the

Bank reneged on its promise by writing to the Plaintiff on 28.11.1991 that the Defendant

Bank was unable to extttnd the guarantee since Cashian Herath the Contractor had

written a letter dated 04.11.1991 asking the bank not to extend the guarantee and that the

Defendant bank's liability under the guarantee (PI) was therefore completely at an end.

The learned President's counsel for the Plaintiff Respondent described it as a deception

practice upon the Plaintiff when one juxtaposed the _t'wo letters P8 and PH. The letter

PH refers to a letter from Cashian Herath dated 04)1.1991 informing the bank not to

extend the guarantee. It" is quite apparent that the Defendant bank would have had

Cashian Herath's letter (If 04.11.1991 when it wrote the letter P8 dated 11.11.1991 to the

Plaintiff. However, no reference was ever made by the Bank in letter P8 of 11.11.1991 to

Cashian Herath's letter of 04.11.1991. In other words the Defendant bank while

suppressing Cashian Herath's letter of 04.11.1991 in its letter P8 of 11.11.1991 sought by its

letter P8 to obtain a withdrawal of the demand made qy the Plaintiff on the guarantee PI , ' by making a promise to the Plaintiff that it would extend the guarantee for a further two

months if the Plaintiff withdrew the claim he had made by its letter of 24.10.1991(P2).

The learned President's counsel argued that by having deceived the Plaintiff into

withdrawing its claim, the bank instead of extending the guarantee as undertaken in

5

letter P8 wrote letter PH of 28.11.1991 stating that it could not extend the guarantee as

Cashian Herath by his Jerter of 04.11.1991 had requested the Bank not to extend the

guarantee.

In the circumstances the learned President's counsel for the Plaintiff Respondent

contended that the Defendant made a fraudulent misrepresentation to deceive the

Plaintiff into withdrawlng its demand and thereafter refused to extend the bank

guarantee for further tWG months with a view to relieving itself of the liability of having

to pay the said sum of Rs.1.76S,34Sr demanded by the Plaintiff on the said bank

guarantee PI.

The learned President's counsel for the Plaintiff Respondent contended that there had

been collusion between the Defendant Appellant ec1.nd Cashian Herath. The counsel

attempted to construct an argument on collusion beginning from the application of

Cashian Herath made in Jhe Court of Appeal for a temporary injunction.

Having obtained a temporc:ry injunction from the Court of Appeal, he later informed that

he would not be proceeding to extend the restraining order on the Provincial Council

and further obtained a dismissal of the said applica\~ion in the Court of Appeal. The

learned President's Counsel argued that the common design was to accomplish the net

result that both the Defendant and Cashian Herath would finally be relieved of their

liability to meet the lawful demand on the guarantee PI made by the Plaintiff.

If Cashian Herath's letter of 04.11.1991 had been available with the bank they cquld have

informed of Cashian He-Hlth's request in their letter P8. Instead the bank sought to

obtain a withdrawal of a due claim made by the Plaintiff on the guarantee PI. If they had

given to extend the guarantee provided the Plaintiff withdrew his claim it is crystal clear

that it was incumbent uron the Defendant bank to honour its undertaking to extend the

guarantee. These are serious omissions and failures on the part of the Defendant

Appellant which call for8n explanation at the trial. When all this evidence pertaining to

the conduct of the bank '0'1S placed by the Plaintiff's witness, the chief secretary of the

L'

6

Provincial Council the bank chose not to cross examine the Plaintiff's witness. In other

words the Defendant bank failed to explain its conduct by giving evidence in the case.

The only matters that was sought to be established by t~e Defendant bank were;

i. the claim was withdrawn by the Plaintiff;

; ii. the guarantee automatically ceased after 31.10.1991;

iii. the bank refused to extend the guarantee after 31.10.1991.

It would appear that except for cross examining th~ Plaintiff's witness on the above

matters there was no attempt made by the Defendant bank to offer any explanation for

their conduct by way of defense evidence. , ,

The learned additional District Judge of Nuwara Eliya by his judgment dated 11.08.1997

;'l" has pronounced judgment In favour of the Plaintiff~ Respondent.

The Defendant~ Appellant has preferred this appeal against the said judgment on the

following grounds: ~

a. the learned Judge in dismissing the Appellant's case has made the award as a

matter of course without any analysis of the relevant legal issues or the evidence;

b. the learned Judge failed to consider that the guarantee in question becomes

automatically null and void and ceases to be of any force or avail in law after the

31.10.1991 and thafthe liability of the Appellant would be completely extinguished

after the said date ~lnless a claim was made on the Appellant prior to the 31.10.1991.

c. the learned Judge erred in law in failing to consider that the guarantee in question

had expired prior to an application being made for its extension;

d. the learned Judge erred in law in failing to consider that the guarantee bond in

question expired on the 31.10.1991 and therefore the Respondent could not have

maintained his action as it was seeking to enforce a guarantee bond which had

expired;

e. the Respondent by document P9 withdrew the claim it made on the said

guarantee and it was so admitted by the Respondent's own witness but the

I 7

learned District Judge has not addressed her mind to the legal principals involved

in the said withdrawal;

f. the learned District Judge has not considered the relevant law with regard to

guarantees in that contacts of guarantee are strictly construed in favour of the

surety.

The bank had promised to extend the bank guarantee for a further period of two months

prOvided the Plaintiff made an express withdrawal of the claim that had already been

made on the bank. It is in tesponse to this representation that the Plaintiff withdrew the

claim that it had already made on 24.10.1991.

I take the view that if a representation is made and the representee acts on that

representation to hislher detriment, the representor is obligated to keep his promise

and not renege on it. Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance quite clearly lays down that;

"When one person has by his declaration, act, dr omission intentionally caused or

permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief,

neither he nor his representative shall be allowed in any suit or proceedings

between himself and such person or his representative to deny the truth of that

thing"

So it does not lie now in the mouth of the Defendant bank to contend that the guarantee

extinguished itself on thE; 31/10/1991. In fact on the 24.10.1991 the Plaintiff had already

made its call on the bank guarantee. The Plaintiff was compelled or induced to withdraw

its call on the guarantee by the representation made to it by the bank that it would

extend the guarantee provided the Plaintiff withdrew the demand made on 24/10/1991. It

was the Defendant~ Appellant bank that secured the withdrawal of the demand. It was

not a voluntary withdrawal made by the Plaintiff Respondent. It was a withdrawal

brought upon by the promise held out by the Defendant~Appeliant Bank. Estoppel

would operate against tht'; bank from going back on this promise .

..., Whichever name one might call it, promissory estoppel too would prevent the bank from

going back on the promise which it gave the Plaintiff.

Promissory Estoppel

The doctrine of promissory estoppel is not really based on the principle of estoppel but it

is a doctrine evolved by equity in order to prevent injustice. It is neither in the realm of

contract nor in the realm of estoppel. Its object is to interpose equity to mitigate the

rigour of strict law. The essential ingredients of a promissory estoppel are:~

(i) a party should have by his word or conduct given to the other party a clear and

unequivocal promise or assurance;

, .

(ii) this promise or ~~ssurance was intended to be acted upon so as to create a

binding legal relatIonship;

(iii) the promisee has in fact acted upon such promise and has significantly altered

his position as a result.

The essence of the doctrine of promissory estoppel is. the principle that when one party

has by his words or condus:t made to the other a promise or assurance which is intended

to affect the legal relatiops between them and to be acted upon accordingly, then, once

the other party has taken him at his words and acted on it, the party who gave the

promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal

relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but must accept their

legal relation subject to .the qualifications, which he himself has so introduced~See

Combe vs. Combe 1951 ~ E.R. 767 at 770. Whereas common law estoppel was confined , to representations of exi~ting fact, promissory estoppel is not so circumscribed in its

scope and may be founded upon a representation in regard to future conduct~ See

Halsbury, Laws of England 3rd cd. Vol. 15, p.175

A statement of intention or a promise not to raise further dispute would not operate as

I an estoppel according to the earlier view taken in PerdurupiUai vs. MariampiUai (1916)

9

2 C.W.R. 42. This view has now been revised and even a promise or a statement of

intention as to the futuremay found an estoppel. The decision of Denning LJ. in Central

London Property Ltd v.s. High Trees House Ltd (1956) 1 AER 256, has now become

an established authority. He followed this decision in the case of Lyle~Mellor vs. A. Lewis

&: Co. Ltd. (1956) 1 AER 247 (CA). Relying on the above two English cases, it was held in

the Indian case of Sat Narain vs. Union of India (1968) 2 SCWR 335, that 'there must

be a promise or assuranct: .intended to be acted upon which in fact must have been acted

. i upon and only then the question to honour it arises. No estoppel arose where there is no

" evidence to show that a party acted on the representation made by the other not to claim

compensation, if the property was released'.

So even this doctrine the promise to extend the letter of guarantee must have been

honored by the bank instead of offering a belated excuse that Cashian Herath had

objected it. If it had been extended, it would have enabled the Plaintiff to make a call

agam.

Fiduciary Duties

There is a catena of cases which impose fiduciary dutks on the part of banks and in view

of the extension of the term customer today as developed in banking law and recognized

by Section 33 of the Fin~ncial Transactions Reporting Act No.6 of 2006, the plaintiff

Provincial council would also be a customer of the Defendant Appellant bank as it was in

a contractual relationship of the beneficiary and surety vis~a~vis the bank guarantee

involved in this case.

In view of the fact that the Defendant Appellant bank had given a letter of guarantee to

the Plaintiff Respondent as far back as 17.06.1991 (P7), the Plaintiff Respondent became

its customer by virtue of Section 33 of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No.6 of

2006 and the customer is owed fiduciary duties by banks.

A bank cannot give advice when there is a conflict of interest. Once it has established a

contractual relationship such as the issuance of bank guarantee which imposes on it

duties to honour the promise of payment upon demand, it cannot offer advice to the

beneficiary to withdraw a demand in exchange for its prmise to extend the validity

10

period of the bank guarantee and later turn back on that promise~see Woods v Martins

Bank (1959) 1 Q.B. 55.

A definition is also offered on the meaning of a demand guarantee in Article 2(a) of the

ICC's Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees ('URDG') [publication 458].

"For the purpose of these Rules, a demand guarantee (hereinafter referred to as

"Guarantee") means any guarantee, bond or other payment undertaking, however

named or described, by the a bank, insurance company or other body of persons

(hereinafter called as ("Guarantor") given in writing for the payment of money on

presentation in conformity with the terms of th~~ undertaking of a written demand

for payment and SU<4~ other document( s) (for example, a certificate by an architect

or engineer, a judgrr:ent or an arbitral award) as may be specified in the Guarantee,

such undertaking being given:

(i) at the request or on the instructions and under the liability of a party

(hereinafter called 'the Principal"); or

(ii) at the request or on the instructions and under liability of a bank, insurance

company or any other body or person (hereinafter "the Instructing Party") acting

on the instructions 'of the Principal,

to another party (hereinafter the "Beneficiary")"

Article 2 of ICC's Unif6rm Rules for Demand Guarantees ('URDG') [publication 758,

2010] gives a concise definition of a demand guarantee. Demand guarantee or guarantee

means any signed undertaking, however named or described, providing for payment on

presentation of a complying demand;

As articulated in case~; such as Edward Owen_' Engineering Ltd. vs. Barclays

International Ltd. (1978) 1 All ER 976, the fact that a bank guarantee imposes on the

bank a duty to make the payment to the beneficiary according to its terms was adopted

by S.N. Silva]. (as His Lordship then was) in the case of Indica Traders (Pvt) Ltd. and

Others (1994) 3 SLR 387:;at page 398;

11

"It is thus clear that business transaction be~ween a bank and a beneficiary,

constituted in the :nature of a performance bond, a performance guarantee, letter of

guarantee or an irrevocable letter of credit, whereby the bank is obliged to pay

money to a beneficiary, are not tripartite transactions between the bank (surety),

the beneficiary (creditor) and the party at whose instance the bond, guarantee or

letter is issued (the principal debtor) but, simply transaction between the bank

and the beneficiary~ A bank thereby guarantees to the beneficiary payment of

money and is oblige:! to honour that guarantee according to its terms. Any dispute

that may arise between the beneficiary (creditor) and the party at whose instance

the guarantee or letter is given (the principal debtor), on the underlying contract,

cannot be urged to restrain the bank from honourig the guarantee or letter

according to its terms"

The above articulations ~how the autonomous nature of a bank guarantee and as the

demand was made by the,Plaintiff Respondent on the guarantee long before it was due to

expire, the restraining order issued by this court had no impact on the call made by the

Plaintiff~ Respondent because it was not a permanent restraining order.

In view of the passages that I have cited above on the autonomy of performance

guarantees and bank guarantees, the payment on them cannot be legally restrained by

~omeone like Cashian Herf/.th unless fraud was alleged; and proved. There is no allegation

of fraud on the part of the Plaintiff Respondent. The demand made by the Plaintiff

Respondent was in accordance with the terms of the letter of guarantee. Unfortunately

the demand was caused to be withdrawn at the instance of the bank when it was its

mandatory obligation to have honoured its obligations in response to the call made.

The withdrawal of the demand or call on the bank guarantee was secured by the bank on

, . . a promise but this prombe was not honoured. In my view the securing of the withdrawal

was vitiated by a misrepr~sentation which will nullify any attempt to tie the Plaintiff

Respondent to an obligation not to make a demand on the bank guarantee.

Since I find that the Defendant Appellant secured the withdrawal by a misrepresentation

in breach of its fiduciary duty, the demand made on 24JOJ991 still survives and the bank

12

cannot wrongfully and unlawfully refuse to make the payment on the demand made by

the Plaintiff Respondent Moreover, promissory estoppel engulfed to some extent in

section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance will estop the bank from reneging on its

obligations on the bank guarantee.

In the circumstances I hold that the Defendant Appellant bank cannot shy away from its

legal obligation on the letter of guarantee and it is obligated to make the payment on the

demand that has survived.

Accordingly, I affirm the judgment of the learned Additional District judge of Nuwara

Eliya and dismiss the app;:al of the Defendant Appellant with costs.
