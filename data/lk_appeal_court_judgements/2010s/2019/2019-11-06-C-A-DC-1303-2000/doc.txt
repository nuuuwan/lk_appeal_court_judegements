Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Rohan Sahabandu, P.C., for the Appellants.

Dr. Sunil Cooray for the Respondent.

Decided on: 05.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Prema Walisinghe was the owner of the land in suit by deed

No.2114 marked P1. She transferred the property for a sum of

Rs. 15,000/= to Rita de Silva by deed No.35 dated 27.02.1985

marked P2 subject to the condition of retransfer to her or her

successors in title upon payment of a sum of Rs. 15,000/= with

20% interest within one year from the execution of that deed1,

which is, on or before 27.02.1986.

Admittedly, the payment of a sum of Rs. 15,000/= with 20%

interest was not made within one year, and therefore Rita de

Silva transferred that property to the defendant by deed No.5242

dated 08.05.1988 marked P3.

It is interesting to note that, Prema Walisinghe was one of the

subscribing witnesses to deed No.5242, which was an outright

transfer with no conditions as in the earlier deed No.35.

Prema Walisinghe died in 1992, and the plaintiffs, who are the

successors of her intestate estate have filed this action in the

District Court in 1996 seeking declarations that Rita de Silva

could not have transferred the property as an absolute transfer

to the defendant by deed No.5242, and the plaintiffs are entitled

to get the said deed cancelled upon payment of Rs.16,500 with

interest of 20% per mensem to the defendant.

The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs

action and seeking a declaration that he is the owner of the

property.

After trial, the learned District Judge delivered the Judgment in

favour of the defendant. Hence this appeal by the plaintiffs.

In my view, the Judgment of the District Court is absolutely

correct. Although by deed No.35, conditional transfer was

created, once the conditions were not fulfilled within the

stipulated time, the transferee became the absolute owner to the

property without further ado.

I will only refer to the following dicta of Tissa Bandaranayake J.

in the Supreme Court case of Sanmugam v. Thambaiyah2 to

establish that position.

We have on P1 a legal obligation on the purchaser to

retransfer upon fulfilment of the contract within 2 years.

The terms of the deed show it is an outright sale or transfer

of interests in land subject to a condition to reconvey if the

sum of Rs. 5000/- owned by the vendor is paid in full

within the time stipulated. No question of trust arises in

such a context. Time is explicit. On the expiry of two years

the purchaser is relieved of the undertaking to retransfer

the property. The true construction of Deed P1 is that

property has been offered as security for the payment of a

sum of money within 2 years. It is not a pledge or mortgage.

It is well to remember the evidence of Sanmugam that the

bridegrooms parents wanted tangible security. The two

years for obtaining a retransfer lapsed on 4.1.66. It was

held by the Supreme Court in Maggie Silva v. Sai Nona (78

NLR 313) that when the condition underlying the

conditional transfer is not fulfilled the transferee becomes

absolute owner in terms of the agreement of parties free

from any obligation to retransfer. After the two years

lapsed the vendors remaining in possession of the property

without fulfilling the condition rendered themselves liable to

be ejected. On 4.1.66 the purchaser became absolute owner

of the property and consequently the plaintiff got good title

on P2 executed in 1970. In the premises the District Judge

was correct in entering judgment and decree for the plaintiff

as prayed for with costs. The appeal is dismissed with

costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.

For the aforesaid reasons, I affirm the Judgment of the District

Court and dismiss the appeal with costs.
