Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The police initiated these proceedings in the Magistrates Court

under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

No.44 of 1979, regarding a dispute over a right of way between

two parties. The first part consisted of 4 parties, and the second

part 2 parties. Parties of each part are close relations. Each

part was represented by an Attorney-at-Law in the Magistrates

Court and filed joint affidavits and counter affidavits.

Under section 66(6), once pleadings are complete, before the

matter is fixed for inquiry, a duty is cast on the Magistrate to

induce the parties to arrive at a settlement.

According to the journal entries dated 02.08.2012 and

24.08.2012 of the Magistrates Court case record, in compliance

with that provision, the learned Magistrate, in the presence of all

the parties, has decided to go for an inspection of the disputed

road on 27.09.2012.

According to the proceedings dated 27.09.2012, at the

inspection, both parties have been represented by their

3

respective Attorneys-at-Law, and the dispute has been settled

upon conditions until the matter is finally decided by a

competent Court1, which is the District Court. All the parties,

except the 3rd party of the first part who was absent, have signed

the case record in signifying the settlement.

More than 2 months after the said settlement, the 3rd party of

the first part has gone before the High Court by way of revision

seeking to revise the orders dated 27.09.20122 on the grounds

that: (a) she was not a party to the settlement as she did not

sign the case record in terms of section 66(6); (b) no order has

been made on the settlement in terms of section 66(6); and (c)

there is evidence that she has been using the disputed road for a

long time.3

The learned High Court Judge has dismissed that application by

Judgment dated 22.01.2015. The 3rd party of the first part

(hereinafter the appellant) has come before this Court against

the said Judgment of the High Court.

Let me first consider the first ground. That is, the appellant was

not a party to the settlement as she did not sign the case record

as dictated in section 66(6). If the appellant thinks that she was

not a party to the settlement as she did not sign the case record

and therefore she is not bound by the settlement/order, she

shall, in my view, first complain it to the Magistrates Court.

She cannot bypass the Magistrates Court and go straight before

the High Court to complain that an order has been made against

1 Vide last paragraph of page 1 of the said proceedings. 2 Vide prayer to the petition tendered to the High Court. 3 Vide paragraph 10 of the said petition.

her ex parte. The appellate Court has no wherewithal to initiate

an inquiry into that allegation.

The second ground is, no order has been made on the settlement

in terms of section 66(6). If the appellant is not a party to the

settlement, whether or not an order has been made on the

settlement is irrelevant to her. If she thinks that no order has

been made, and therefore the agreement is unenforceable, she

can remain silent. If no order has been made, it is difficult to

understand why she went before the High Court seeking to set

aside the orders dated 27.09.2012.

The third ground relates to the merits of the application. When

the matter is settled, there is no necessity to consider the merits

and demerits of the substantive matter.

Without prejudice to the above, I must state that, the nature of

section 66 proceedings is quasi civil. As the learned High Court

Judge has correctly stated, there is no necessity for a party to be

physically present before Court in an application under section

66. As the section 66(8)(a) provides, a party can enter

appearance by an Attorney-at-Law. That is what the appellant

has done in this case from the inspection. It is not her position

that she was not represented, as per the proceedings at the

inspection, by her Attorney-at-Law. Her complaint seems to be

that, notwithstanding she was represented by an Attorney-at-

Law, as she did not sign the case record, she is not bound by

the settlement. Although section 66(6) requires the settlement

to be signed by the parties, in my view, when parties are

represented by Attorneys-at-Law, the settlement does not

5

become invalid, merely because one absent party who was

represented by an Attorney-at-Law has failed to sign the case

record. The other three parties of the first part were physically

present and signed the case record despite two Attorneys-at-Law

have appeared for all the four parties of the first part. As I

stated at the outset, the four parties of the first part are closely

connected and made one voice and filed pleadings jointly. Hence

no prejudice whatsoever has been caused to the appellant for

her being absent at the inspection.

The appellant must remember that what she filed before the

High Court was not an appeal but a revision application. Unlike

an appeal, which is exercised as of right, revision is a

discretionary remedy, which the Court is loath to exercise unless

there is a grave miscarriage of justice, which shocks the

conscience of the Court.

In Sinna Veloo v. Messrs Lipton Ltd4 it was held:

When parties to an action enter into a settlement and are

represented by their Proctors, they need not be personally

present when the settlement is notified to the Court in terms

of section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code. Once the terms

of settlement as agreed upon are presented to Court and

notified thereto and recorded by Court, a party cannot resile

from the settlement even though the decree has not yet

been entered.

In Francis Wanigasekera v. Pathirana5, Weerasekera J. stated:

4 (1963) 66 NLR 214 5 [1997] 3 Sri LR 231 at 234

6

There has been a very pernicious practice among litigants to

resile from agreements merely because they have not

subscribed their signature to the record. This pernicious

practice in my view must be condemned and refuted with

all the contempt it deserves.

The words that an order made in accordance with the terms as

settled found in section 66(6) shall not be taken to mean that

the settlement will be ineffective unless a formal order is made

after the recording of the settlement. What is the order the

Magistrate is expected to make? In my view, a simple sentence

such as Parties shall comply with the above settlement, The

above settlement is to be considered as an order of Court.

When a case is settled there is no occasion for the Judge to

deliver a judgment or order. In an ordinary civil case, after the

settlement, decree is entered in terms of the settlement, and not

in terms of the judgment or order as judgment or order is non-

existent. Entering decree is a ministerial act and the

responsibility of the Court. The failure to do that ministerial act

does not make the settlement invalid. (Pathirana v. Induruwage

[2002] 2 Sri LR 63) A party shall not be made to suffer for lapses

on the part of the Court.

In Distilleries Company Ltd v. Kariyawasam6 Nanayakkara J.

rightly pointed out that construing or interpreting a provision of

law cannot be solved merely by adopting the literal interpretation

of a section or meaning given to a word in a dictionary as urged

by learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondent. A provision of law

6 [2001] 3 Sri LR 119 at 124-125

7

has to be interpreted contextually, giving consideration to the

spirit of the law.

Having considered the scheme and purpose, in my view, there is

no place for hair-splitting arguments and high-flown technical

objections in section 66 applications. The sole intention of

introducing this special piece of legislation is nothing but to

prevent breach of the peace arising out of land disputes and not

to determine the rights of the parties. Until the parties go before

a competent Court to have their substantive rights determined,

the legislature expects the Court to make a provisional order.

The appellant says that the settlement is irrational and absurd.

Even if it is correct, it shall not affect the validity of the

settlement. That is not a permanent order. The appellant can

go before the District Court to vindicate her rights. Until such

time she is bound by the settlement.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
