Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this application was taken up for argument on 4th October 2018, the

learned Counsel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its

judgment on the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

~---"----\I-1WR-~Fl- thi-s matter was called on 20th February 2019 for judgment, this Court

requested the learned Counsel to provide clarifications on certain matt~rs, - ___ _

--.---------------- ------ ---which were duly provided by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the

learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The Petitioner, who is a brother of the 4th Respondent, has filed this

application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the

letter dated 2nd September 2010, annexed to the petition marked 'P12', by

which the 1 st Respondent informed the 4th Respondent as follows:

The explanation offered by the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the issuance of

'P12', is that several errors had been committed in the recognition of the 4th

Respondent as the successor to the land that is the subject matter of this

application and with regard to the extent of the land, and that 'P12' was issued

to rectify the said errors.

3

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner and the 4th - 7th Respondents are the children of Jayasundera

Mudiyanselage Kiri Mudiyanse. The Petitioner has stated in paragraph 5 of the

petition that "his father Jayasundera Mudiyanselage Kiri Mudiyanse was

a oca ecraorock _of la~E in extent_}A 3R_ 37.9P" situate~ at Kob~igane iri~erms --~

-c>-t=~qni-t--Np.. 68218 -dated 14th Mar~h 1973. Even th~~a copy~J-_t~s~:ct_~- --=-

------------ --

permit has not been submitted by either party, there is no dispute between

the parties that Kiri Mudiyanse had been issued with a permit in 1973. It

appears that the extent of the land at the time the permit was issued was as

stated in paragraph 5 of the petition, although paragraph 8 of the petition

seems to indicate otherwise. 1

According to the Land Ledger relating to the said permit which has been filed

by t_~e 1st and 2nd Respondents marked 'Ri', the land referred to in the said

permit has been identified as Lot No. 7 of Final Village Plan No. 1574. The

extent of the land specified in 'Ri' is only 1A 3R OP. The Petitioner has

submitted a copy of Plan No. 1574 dated 16th October 1918 together with his

motion dated 30th April 2019. According to the Register of Settlements

annexed to the said Plan, the total extent of Lot NO.7 is lOA 1R 2P. The extent

of land given to Kiri Mudiyanse by the said permit is therefore only a part of

Lot NO.7 of Plan No. 1574.

This Court has examined the Land Ledger 'Rl' and observes that the following

endorsements have been made on 'Rl':

1 In paragraph 8, the Petitioner statt?s that 'in the said permit No. 68218 and the Jayabhoomi grant, the extent of the land was indicated as one acre and three roods (lA 3R OOP).'

4

1. Kiri Mudiyanse had nominated his wife, Dissanayake Mudiyanselage

Dingiri Menika as his successor under the Permit.

2. Part of the said land has been given by Kiri Mudiyanse to the 3rd

Respondent, the Kobeigane Multi Purpose Co-operative Society (MPCS) -

\

@cs~eDz;ffi@ rnz;S) ~eD) ei)>O~C) 6)QsmQ CDO erz:rn."

In terms of the said endorsement, the extent of the land given to Kiri

Mudiyanse in terms of the Permit has been reduced by approximately X acre

pursuant to an inquiry. This Court must observe at this stage that the State has

not issued the M PCS a permit in respect of the said land, although it is the

position of the MPCS that it constructed a building on the said land and is in

possession of the said X acre of land.

On 17th June 1996, HE the President had issued Kiri Mudiyanse a Grant in terms

of Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance. According to this Grant,

which has been annexed to the petition marked 'P1', the total extent of the

land is lA 3R OOP. This Court observes that there is no reference in 'P1' to a

survey plan, even though Plan No. 1574 and Supplement No. 1 of Plan No.

1574

3 prepared in November 1981, were available in respect of the land. This

Court observes further that the extent of land given in 'P1' is 37.9P less than

what the Petitioner has claimed in paragraph 5 of the petition as being the

extent of land that his father received in terms of the permit. In paragraph 8 of

his petition, the Pet itioner has admitted that, 'in the said permit No. 68218 and

2 This is a reference to the ,<o b ~ ig a n e MPCS.

3 Lot \Jo . 7 of Pla n ,\lo . 1574 w as r e- ~ ur v e y e d in 1981 .

5

the Jayabhoomi grant, the extent of the land was indicated as one acre and

three roods (lA 3R OOP).'

Thus, it is safe for this Court to conclude that Kiri Mudiyanse was initially given

an extent of lA 3R 37.9P, out of which he agreed to give X acre to the MPCS,

leavlng 1m \vitfl1A 3R and that the State issued 'P1'in r~sp~ct -of-1A- jR-wI1TCh --

is the exte+lt QTfa-ftO thatKiri M-ud~yanse \fia5 ja--=J;1QSes-siQn-at----me-rlffie-the ------ --- ---- ---

Grant was issued. This position is in fact confirmed by a statement made by the

4th Respondent on 10th December 2007, a copy of which has been tendered to

this Court by the 1st Respondent by way of a motion dated 30th May 2019.4

J<iri l\I1udiyanse had passed away on 8th December 1999 and his spouse, Dingiri

Menika, being his nominated successor, was entitled to succeed to the said

land. In terms of Section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, a

nominated successor fails to succeed to the holding gf an owner if he/she

refuses to succeed to that holding, or if the nominated successor does not

enter into possession of the holding within a period of six months from the

death of the owner. It is the position of the Petitioner that Dingiri Menika did

not enter into possession at all, either as the nominated successor or as the

spouse of Kiri Mudiyanse. Therefore, in terms of Section 72 of the Land

Development Ordinance, if the nominated successor fails to succeed, the title

to the holding shall devolve as prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

It is perhaps appropriate at this stage to refer to the fact that Lot NO.7 in Plan

No. 1574 was re-surveyed in 1981. The Petitioner has submitted with his

motion filed on 30

th April 2019, a copy of Supplement No.1 to Plan No. 1574

4 This statement forms part of the documents marked 'K' submitted in response to a clarification sought by Court.

6

dated 4th November 1981. This Court has examined this Plan and the

Supplementary Tenement List annexed thereto and observes that Lot NO.7 in

Plan No. 1574 has been sub - divided into the following lots:

Lot No. Extent

174 ---3A OR 22P --------- ----- --I-

~.

-175 ----- --2A_OR33E _____ --------

- --L7l. 3R 36P

--+--- ---\

177 1A OR 12P

178 OA 3R 19P

lOA 1R 02P Total

It is observed further that the total extent of the five lots is identical to the

extent of Lot NO.7 in Plan No. 1574.

The first of the two mistakes that the 1st Respondent claims led to the issuance

of 'P12' had occurred in 2003 with the issuance of a letter dated 29th

September 2003 annexed to the petition marked 'P3', by which the then

Divisional Secretary of Kobeigane (the 1st Respondent) had informed the Land

Registrar as follows:

"@eDtl> ffoCD ~eoeD ~~ ~emoQ) ~CDOl;c!cD ~6)C! C>>Q ~. 01 Otm. 03

@@@."

7

This Court must observe that 'P3' too does not have a reference to a lot

number or a Plan. 'P3' does not state the basis on which the Divisional

Secretary had come to the conclusion that the extent of the land should be

increased from the extent specified in the Grant. The only explanation appears

to be that when Supplement No.1 to Plan No. 1574 was prepared in 1981, Lot

No.7 hadbeen divided into five- Iot~. ~!,e-_ ~n_~rtnaJ-ls ffie su~ject ~~tte~ 0 fflis -

is 2A 3R 36P.5 Furthermore, 'P3', has failed to take into consideration the

endorsement made on 'Rl' that X acre has been given to the M PCS.

More importantly, the Divisional Secretary, by issuing 'P3', has acted contrary

to th~ provisions of Section 19(2) of the Land Developmel')t prdinqnce, ~hich

provides that a permit shall be issued in the first instance and a Grant is issued

inter alia only once the land has been developed by the permit holder. This

would necessarily mean tha_t the extent of the land given by way of a permit

shall be identical to the extent of the land for which a Grant is issued

sUbsequently.

What is most important however is that a Grant for a pre-determined extent of

land can only be issued by HE the President6 and thus, a Divisional Secretary

does not have the power, with or without any basis, to increase the extent of

land given by the State.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the increase of the extent

of land by 'P3' is ultra vires the powers of the Divisional Secretary and is illegal.

The ent itlement of Kiri Mudiyanse and his successors therefore should be

5 The extent specified in 'P3' is 3P more than the extent of Lot No. 176.

6 Vide Article 33(2)(f) of the Constitution.

8

limited to the extent of land specified in the Grant, namely 1A 3R and

accordingly, the explanation offered by the present Divisional Secretary that

'P3' had been issued by a mistake is an acceptable explanation.

According to the 1st Respondent, the second mistake that is sought to be

~~ctif~d by way of '~12' occurred _Ln ~OO~. T e Petltlonerh~~ an_nexecffo-tne

petition marked t-ps: an~ affRfavW-Gaf~Q=2-Sh -=Iu-Re-- 2Q04 - b-y which the 4th

- ---\ Respondent had stated that he is the eldest son of Kiri Mudiyanse and that he

is agreeable to share the land with his four siblings, who are the Petitioner and

the 5th -7th Respondents to this application.

Acting _probably on 'P6', the then Divisional Secretary, by a I~tte! dat~~ 8th April

2005, annexed to the petition marked 'PS', had informed the Registrar of

Lands as follows:

"A'ei)tl) qot ~oiI> ~eSotl) ~IDe B>oor; ~ d~~O ~OOecS@>ecsS

Having recognized the 4th Respondent, who is the eldest son of Kiri Mudiyanse

as the successor, the then Assistant Divisional Secretary, Kobeigane, by a letter

dated 8th September 2005 annexed to the petition marked 'PS', had granted

the following approval:

This Court observes that the aggregate of the above allocation together with

provision for a road, as depicted in the Plan annexed to the petition marked

'P7' is 2A 3R 37.9P. It is therefore clear to this Court that the mistake

committed by 'P3' with regard to the extent of the land continued with 'PS'.

Even though the learned Senior State Counsel has not disputed the right of the

Divisional Secretary to issue 'PS', this Court is of the view that the Divisional

Secretary had no right in terms of the law to grant approval to dispose of an

extent of land which was greater than the extent of land that had been

alienated by the Grant 'Pl'. To that extent, this Court is of the view that 'PS' is

ultra vires the powers of the Divisional Secretary, and is therefore illegal. '

10

According to the Petitioner, pursuant to the approval granted by 'PS', the 4th

Respondent had executed deeds in favour of the Petitioner and the 5th -7th

Respondents. The land that was alienated to the Petitioner is the land on

which the building of the MPCS is situated. The present dispute leading to the

issuance of 'P12' appears to have been triggered by steps that the Petitioner

took to evict the MPCS from- the and--tnar-wasaITocatecf to -fne Petitioner ------ ---

pursuant to 'PS'. It is t~~ _p<??!ti:ofl--of the P-etitfoner that his father Kiri

Mudiyanse had constructed a building on the land allocated to him and that

Kiri Mudiyanse, who was on the Board of Directors of the MPCS had allowed

the said MPCS to occupy the said building. This is however contrary to the

-- --

endorsement on the Land Ledger marked 'R1', according to which Kiri

Mudiyanse had surrendered an extent of X a1:re to be giv~n to the MPCS to

construct a building after an inquiry. This is in fact confirmed by the statement

that the 4th Respondent had made on 10th December 2007. 7 This Court must

observe that the southern boundary of the land referred to in 'P1' is the MPCS

land, which confirms the entry in the land ledger 'R1' that Kiri Mudiyanse had

surrendered part of the land to be given to the MPCS. The position of the

Petitioner therefore cannot be accepted.

The Petitioner states that he filed action in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya in

February 2009 to evict the MPCS from the land allocated to him and that while

the said case was pending, certain officials had attempted to survey the said

land. The Petitioner states further that although he requested the 1st

Respondent to hold an inquiry, and an inquiry was in fact scheduled for 20th

August 2009, the inquiry was not held as the other parties were not present.

The Petitioner states that it is only thereafter that 'P12' had been issued on 2nd

7 Supra.

11

September 2010. The result of 'Pl2' is that the 4th Respondent as well as the

Petitioner does not have any right to the land that is the subject matter of the

Grant 'Pl' and has culminated in this action.

This being the background to this application, this Court would now consider

the three grounds on which ttie learned C0l.!ns~1 for the Petitioner is see_king a

Writ of Certiorari to quash 'Pl2'. Firstly, the Petitioner states that an inquiry

was not held prior to 'Pl2' being issued. Secondly, the Petitioner states that

the 1st Respondent had no power to cancel the devolution of ownership to the

4th Respondent. Thirdly, the Petitioner states that in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance, the land should devolve on the 4th Respondent by

virtue of the 4th Respondent being the eldest son, upon Dingiri Menika

relinquishing her rights as nominee.

A consideration of the above grounds requires this Court to re-visit the

position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, which is that the increase in the extent

of the land from 1A 3R to 2A 3R 37.9P as borne out by 'P3' is inadvertent and is

a mistake. Quite apart from being inadvertent, this Court reiterates its view

that the 1st Respondent has no legal authority to increase the extent of the

land, over and above what has been allocated by the Grant. Furthermore, by

the Petitioner's own admission in paragraph 5 of the petition, Kiri Mudiyanse

only had 1A 3R 37.9P, of which X acre had been given to the MPCS, resulting in

Kiri Mudiyanse only having 1A 3R, for which extent of land he was given the

Grant 'Pl'. By a written statement made under oath by the 4th Respondent in

2005, produced by the Respondents marked 'R2', the 4th Respondent had in

12

fact admitted that the extent of the land is only 1A 3R.8 The 1st and 2nd

Respondents have stated further that the extent of the land was increased on

the basis of a private survey done by the parties, which however does not

appear to be correct in view of Supplement No.1 to Plan No. 1574.

Be _that as it may, this Court is in agree~ent with the submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel that Kiri Mudfyanse was entitled to hold only 1A 3R and

therefore, the extent of land that his successors are entitled to receive is

limited to lA 3R. This Court is of the view that once this discrepancy was

discovered, the 1st Respondent was entitled to take steps to rectify the several

--

mistakes committed by his predecessors in office. This Court is of the view that

such a course of action does not affeg: the rights of the 4th Respondent and/or

the Petitioner as neither of them could have held any expectation of receiving

an extent of land greater than what is specified in the Grant 'Pi'. The 1st and

2nd Respondents have stated that for the purpose of rectifying the said

mistakes, an inquiry was held on 22nd October 2007, a fact which has not been

disclosed to this Court by the Petitioner. In response to the clarifications

sought by this Court, the learned Senior State Counsel has filed the statements

recorded at the said inquiry, which clearly demonstrates that the Petitioner

too made a statement at the said inquiry. Thus, there is no merit in the first

ground urged by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents failed to conduct an inquiry prior to issuing 'P12'.

8 'R2' dated 30

th August 2005 reads as follows: "@~ &) ~e1) J.M ~~~ c"e1) ~ eDesS {'fd~ 85585 t;,osnJ ~@e5))oQJ@cl <YcOG@'" {'f,6) {'fmc ~ 1999.12.08 ~e1) (!)a, (J(!Q {'f(;0). (JCS)(j~(!<JesS Q). <J@.

13

The '1 st and 2nd Respondents have produced three letters written by the 2nd

Respondent to the 1st Respondent marked 'RS,9, 'R6,lO and 'R7,ll, the

cumulative effect of which are as follows:

a) The alienation of an extent of land over and above what is in the grant is

wrong;

b) The alienation of the land to the 4th Respondent, prior to it being

allocated to Dingiri Menika is wrong;

c) The granting of approval to sub-divide a land in extent of 2A 3R 37.9P is

misconceived as Kiri Mudiyanse never held an extent in excess of 1A 3R;

d) The boundaries of the land assigned to Kiri Mudiyanse by the Grant

should be demarcated on the ground;

e) Steps must be taken to cancel the registration effected in favour of the 4th

Respondent and to register the name of Dingiri Manika as the successor.

This Court observes that even though the decision was to implement all of the

above, which fact has been reiterated in the Statement of Objections of the 1st

and 2nd Respondents as well, the 1st Respondent had merely issued 'P12'

cancelling the entitlement that the 4th Respondent had to the land. This Court

is of the view that upon the death of Kiri Mudiyanse in 1999, his spouse Dingiri

Manika was entitled to succeed as she was the nominated successor. As she

st July 2007.

10 Issued in August 2008. 11 'r. Dated 18' September 2008 .

14

failed to succeed to the said land, the Divisional Secretary was entitled to

resort to Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance and take steps to

register the 4th Respondent as the successor. However, all this could only be

done in respect of the extent of land set out in the Grant, namely, lA 3R. The

1st and 2nd Respondents have sought to explain 'P12' on the basis that it was

issued in order to regularise the mistakes that had been committed, as set out

in 'RS', IR6' and 'R7'. This result has however not been achieved, as 'P12' was

\ limited to the cancellation of the registration of the name of the 4th

Respondent.

This Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the decision in 'P12' to cancel the devolution of ownership to

the 4th Respondent is misconceived and illegal as the 4th Respondent, by virtue

of being the eldest son of Kiri Mudiyanse, was entitled to succeed to the land

specified in the Grant 'Pi' once his mother Dingiri Manika failed to succeed to

the said land upon the death of Kiri Mudiyanse.12 In the said circumstances,

this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (b) of the

prayer to the petition, quashing the decision contained in 'P12', subject to the

condition that the 4th Respondent shall only be entitled to hold the extent of

land specified in the Grant, namely lA 3R.

The above conclusion of this Court that the 4th Respondent is only entitled to

lA 3R would necessarily mean that the approval granted by 'PS' and the

subsequent transfer of part of the land to the Petitioner and to the 5th -7 th

Respondents over and above the entitlement of the 4 th Respondent in terms of

the Grant is bad in law and is a nullity_ The 4 th Respondent may, if he so

desires, seek fresh approval from the 1st Respondent to alienate the land

among the Petitioner and the 5th -7th Respondents but subject to the extent

specified in the Grant, and the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance.

The 1st Respondent shall be entitled to take steps in terms of the Law to

demarcate on the ground, the boundaries specified in the Grant and to

re_g~l~rise any unauthorized po~~e~si<?~ by _th~ Petitioner and the 4th -7th

_ Respondents. This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
