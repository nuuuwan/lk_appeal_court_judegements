Decided on: 08.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

This is an application filed by the two petitioners against the two

respondents under section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, No.44 of 1979, alleging dispossession of a portion

of a land described in the schedule to the petition within two

months before filing of the application in the Magistrates Court.

The information has been filed on 05.02.2014 and the

dispossession has taken place on 18.12.2013.1 As the police

have referred the matter to the Mediation Board before reporting

facts to Court to see whether settlement is possible, the

petitioners have gone to the Magistrates Court by way of a

private information before two month period from the date of

dispossession is lapsed. Upon being satisfied with the material

placed before Court, the learned Magistrate has held with the

petitioners and granted relief under section 68(3) by restoring

them in possession. This order has been affirmed by the High

Court in revision. The respondent-appellants (appellants) have

come before this Court against the said Judgment of the High

Court.

The learned counsel for the appellants raises only one point in

appeal. That is, the learned Magistrate has pronounced the

order without calling for the observation notes relating to this

dispute from the police. According to the journal entry dated

04.04.2014 of the Magistrates Court case record, the learned

Magistrate, whilst accepting counter affidavits, on his own, not

for any apparent special reason, but, as a matter of course, has

called for observation notes from the police. That order

routinely made, has not been pursued, nor such notes have ever

been tendered. Nobody knows whether the police have ever had

a scene visit after the complaints were made for them to have

made observation notes. In my view, that order calling for

police observation notes is an unspecific and irresponsible

order. Thereafter, upon both parties filing written submissions,

the learned Magistrate has pronounced the aforesaid order.

I observe that in the written submissions tendered to the

Magistrates Court, the appellants have not taken up the

position that without police observation notes being tendered

to Court, the Court cannot make an order or something to that

effect.2 Not a word has been mentioned about police observation

notes in the said written submissions. What the counsel for the

appellants in that written submissions has stated is, that,

although it was incumbent on the part of the petitioner-

respondents (respondents) to tender an observation report (not

police observation notes) through the respondents lawyer in

order to prove breach of the peace, such notes have not been

produced.3 I emphasize that the counsel for the appellants has

2 Vide pages 186-189 of the brief. 3 Vide last paragraph of page 2 of the written submissions of the appellants tendered to the MC which continues to the next page (at pages 187-188 of the brief).

expected the lawyer for the respondents to tender observation

report in order to satisfy the Court on breach of the peace and

nothing else. The counsel for the appellants before this Court

does not take up the position that there was no likelihood of a

breach of the peace and therefore the Magistrates Court could

not have proceeded with the application. The reason why the

counsel for the appellants before this Court insist on police

observation notes is not clear. In the written submissions

counsel says that by failure to call for police observation notes,

there was an infringement of natural justice on these

appellants! I am unable to understand that argument. It is

clear from the police complaints that there was a grave

likelihood of a breach of the peace over this dispute.

As the learned High Court Judge has pointed out, there is no

necessity to call for police observation notes even though upon

his discretion the Magistrate can call for a report. However

there is no such mandatory legal requirement. Both parties

have field copious documentary evidence to substantiate their

positions, and therefore the Magistrate had enough material

before him to decide the matter without police observation

notes, the existence of which is not known.

This appeal is devoid of merits.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
