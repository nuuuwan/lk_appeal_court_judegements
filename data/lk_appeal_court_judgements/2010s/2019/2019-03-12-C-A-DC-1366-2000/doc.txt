Plaintiff-Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: A.K. Chandrakantha for the Defendant-

Appellants.

S. Jayathillaka for the Plaintiff-Respondents.

Decided on: 11.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of

Pugoda seeking declaration of title to the land described in the

second schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendants

therefrom and damages. The defendants filed an answer

seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action. After trial the learned

District Judge entered Judgment for the plaintiff. Hence this

appeal by the defendants.

The sole contention of the defendants in appeal is that the

learned District Judge erred in entering the Judgment for the

plaintiff without properly identifying the land. This contention,

in the facts and circumstances of this case, is well-founded.

3

The plaintiffs in the first schedule to the plaint described a land

named as Galabadawatta in extent about 10 acres. They say

that this land was amicably partitioned among the co-owners in

1933 and one of the co-owners, namely, Podinona, got the

portion of land described in the second schedule to the plaint.

The second schedule to the plaint described a land known as

Galabadawatta in extent 3 Roods and 21 Perches, shown as Lot

K in Plan No. 518 dated 13.12.1933 made by D.W. Edirisinghe,

L.S. This Plan No. 518 is said to be the amicable Partition Plan.

It is the position of the plaintiffs that upon Podinonas death, the

rights of Podinona devolved on Misinona, and Misinona

transferred the said Lot K in Plan No. 518 dated 13.12.1933 in

extent of 3 Roods and 21 Perches to the two plaintiffs by deed

marked P1 dated 27.02.1989. That means, this transfer has

been done, more than 55 years after preparing the said Plan.

However, after the said purchase, the plaintiffs have not been

allowed to clear the land by the defendants and thereafter in a

section 66 Application filed under the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, the possession of the defendants has been confirmed.

The plaintiffs admit that when executing the deed P1, Misinona

did not have the Plan referred to in the deed, i.e. Plan No. 518

dated 13.12.1933, and also referred to in the second schedule to

the plaint. The details of the Plan have been written down in a

piece of paper by Misinona and given to the Notary.1 Up to the

conclusion of the case, the said Plan was not produced. It is not

to be found.

The plaintiffs have got a Plan prepared for the purpose of this

case. That Plan was marked as P2. The surveyor who prepared

that Plan in his report has stated that the land surveyed is 36.4

Perches less than the land described in the second schedule to

the plaint. The surveyor in his evidence has stated that he is

unable to state from which side, the land has got reduced. The

surveyor further states that he is unable to state that the land

surveyed and depicted in Plan P2 is the same land described in

the second schedule to the plaint because the Plan No. 518

described in the second schedule to the plaint was never

produced to him. This is critical. It is clear that the boundaries

described in the second schedule to the plaint do not tally with

those in Plan P2.

Despite these glaring discrepancies and infirmities in respect of

the identification of the land, the learned District Judge has

entered Judgment for the plaintiff substituting the land depicted

in Plan P2 for the land described in the second schedule to the

plaint. This conclusion is plainly unacceptable on the evidence

of the surveyor, who made Plan P2.

When I read the Judgment of the learned District Judge, which

runs into 24 pages, it is clear that she has tried her best to give

equitable reliefs to the plaintiffs. This is made amply clear by

reading the paragraph of the Judgment which appears just

before the answers to the issues.2 At the end of that paragraph

the learned Judge says that once the Plan No. 518 is found, the

plaintiff can re-demarcate the boundaries! That means, the

learned Judge has given a temporary order until the Plan No.

518 mentioned in the second schedule to the plaint is found.

This is a rei vindicatio action, and not a section 66 Application

filed under the Primary Courts Procedure Act. That itself goes to

show that the boundaries in Plan P2 are not correct and Plan P2

does not depict the land the plaintiffs claim in this action. Let

me quote that paragraph of the Judgment in full.

It is essential in a vindicatory action, as much as in a partition

action, for the corpus to be identified with precision. This

becomes extremely important for the execution of the decree in

the event the plaintiff succeeds. (David v. Gnanawathie [2000] 2

Sri LR 352, Gunasekera v. Punchimenika [2002] 2 Sri LR 43)

It was held in Peeris v. Savunhamy (1951) 54 NLR 207 that a

plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action such as this, not only must

prove dominium to the land, but also the boundaries of it by

evidence admissible in law.

In Hettiarachchi v. Gunapala [2008] 2 Appellate Law Recorder 70

at 79 it was held that if the plaintiff fails to identify the land

which he claims dominium with the land on the ground, his

action must fail.

Justice Marsoof in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 378

had this to say on this matter: The identity of the subject matter

is of paramount importance in a rei vindicatio action because the

object of such an action is to determine ownership of the property,

which objective cannot be achieved without the property being

clearly identified. Where the property sought to be vindicated

consists of land, the land sought to be vindicated must be

identified by reference to a survey plan or other equally

expeditious method. It is obvious that ownership cannot be

ascribed without clear identification of the property that is

subjected to such ownership, and furthermore, the ultimate

7

objective of a person seeking to vindicate immovable property by

obtaining a writ of execution in terms of Section 323 of the Civil

Procedure Code will be frustrated if the fiscal to whom the writ is

addressed, cannot clearly identify the property by reference to the

decree for the purpose of giving effect to it. It is therefore essential

in a vindicatory action, as much as in a partition action, for the

corpus to be identified with precision.

Then it is abundantly clear that the plaintiff is not entitled to

succeed in this action.

The learned District Judge in the Judgment has found fault with

the defendants for not producing the Plan No. 518, which she

says was with the first defendants father, Romanis.3 The

defendants do not accept that it was with Romanis. The learned

District Judge has also found fault with the defendants for not

superimposing their Plan V2 on Plan P2 to identify the land

claimed by the plaintiffs. This is unknown to our law. The

learned Judge has expected the defendants to prove the

plaintiffs case.

It is well settled law that in a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff

must strictly prove his title as pleaded and relied upon by him

no matter how weak the defendants case is. The defendant need

not prove anything, still less his own title. If the plaintiff fails to

prove his title, his action must fail. (vide Dharmadasa v.

Jayasena [1997] 3 Sri LR 327 at 330, Loku Menika v. Gunasekare

[1997] 2 Sri LR 281, Jayatissa v. Gunadasa [2008] BALR 293 at

295)

The Judgment of the District Court cannot be allowed to stand,

and the same is set aside. The plaintiffs action in the District

Court shall stand dismissed.

According to the plaintiffs, their father and the first defendants

father and several others are co-owners of the larger land of

Galabadawatta. Even assuming that there was an amicable

partition in 1933, it appears that, it has not been acted upon.

The parties to that amicable partition have not separated off

their portions and possessed them as distinct and different lots

thereafter. Had it been done, there would not have been any

difficulty to identify the portion of Podinona. Under those

circumstances, this Judgment shall not prevent any party filing

a partition action to partition the larger land, if so advised.

Appeal is allowed. I make no order for costs.
