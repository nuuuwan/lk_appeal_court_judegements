Decided on: 05.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the Commissioner of the Department

of Revenue of the Western Provincial Council (appellant) against

the Judgment of the High Court dated 14.09.2010 whereby the

Notice of Assessment (X18) served on the petitioner (respondent)

on the ground that the petitioner is liable to pay Turnover Tax

was quashed by way of a writ of certiorari on the premise that

the said decision is ultra vires.

When this matter came up for argument, the learned Additional

Solicitor General for the appellant and the learned Presidents

Counsel for the respondent agreed to dispose of the argument by

way of written submissions.

This appeal revolves around the question of charging Turnover

Tax by the Western Provincial Council.

Section 3 of the Financial Statute of the Western Province (R4),

insofar as relevant to the present purposes, reads as follows:

3

3(1) Subject to such limits and exemptions as may be

prescribed by lawthere shall be charged for every

quarterfrom every person who carries on any business in

the province a tax (hereinafter referred to as the turnover

tax) in respect of the turnover made by that person from

that business.

3(2) For the purpose of this chapter business shall mean

selling by wholesale or retail of any commodity or article

but shall not include a sale by a manufacturer.

Accordingly, the appellant can charge turnover tax only from a

person who is not a manufacturer carrying on the business of

selling by wholesale or retail of any commodity or article.

Hence the argument of the appellant in the written submission

that A business thus becomes liable to turnover tax where it is

not carried out by a manufacturer and where it secures a turnover

within the meaning of the statute, is not incomplete, if not

incorrect. A business not carried out by a manufacturer to

become liable to turnover tax, such business shall be selling by

wholesale or retail of any commodity or article.

The commodity involved in this case is beer; and the

manufacturer is The Lion Brewery Ceylon PLC (the Lion

Brewery); and the respondent is, according to Agency Agreement

(X1), a Commission Agent of the Lion Brewery who was paid a

commission for the services rendered.

Section 3 quoted above does not permit the appellant to impose

turnover tax on commission income.

4

The appellant seems to be admitting that, if the said Agency

Agreement is enforced as it is, the respondent is not liable to pay

turnover tax. This I say because the appellant in the written

submission states that These appellants submit with respect

that the said parties had in fact not abided by the tenure of this

agreement thereby rendering the respondents liable to turnover

tax.

Even if the appellant does not admit it, in my view, if the

respondent and the Lion Brewery acted in terms of X1, the

respondent cannot be made liable pay turnover tax as the

respondent did not carry on the business of selling beer either

wholesale or retail.1

The respondent was a Commission Agent acting on behalf of the

Principal, the Lion Brewery.

The argument of the respondent that the business of the

respondent, as per X1 Agreement, is that of a Commission Agent

and that its income is the commission income has been

accepted by the Central Government in relation to charging

Economic Service Charge.2

The invoices marked by both the appellant and the respondent

to establish their cases state that they are the invoices of the

Principal-the Lion Brewery and the respondent is only the Agent

of the Principal. The Agent was acting on behalf of the Principal,

and the sale by the respondent reflected in those invoices was

1 Vide inter alia clauses 4.1(xvi), (xxxix), 5.1(ii), 7.1-7.6 of X1.

2 Vide X10 at page 150 of the brief.

the sale of the Principal and not of the Agent. To facilitate that

sale, the respondent Agent was given a commission. What has

transpired at the interview and reflected on the Notes of

Interview (R6) makes no difference.

The appellant states that there are two VAT registration

numbers in the invoices, one for the Principal and the other for

the Agent indicating the respondent indulges in selling. The

respondent in his counter affidavit, drawing attention to X21-

X21(viii) has clearly stated that VAT was paid by the respondent

not on the sales but on the commission income.3 This has not

been denied by the appellant.

The appellant in the written submissions states that Section

2(1) of the Economic Service Charge Act No.13 of 2006 imposes on

persons a charge in respect of every part of the relevant turnover

of such person or partnership for that relevant quarter. The said

Act defines relevant turnover in section 3(2) to mean, the

aggregate turnover for that relevant quarter of every trade,

business carried on or exercised by such person or partnership as

the case may be in Sri Lanka whether directly or through an

agent.

The appellant then states that the respondent has lodged the

return in relation to Economic Service Charge for the relevant

period in question wherein the respondent himself has declared

that the turnover for the said period was Rs.130,503,295/=4,

and therefore the respondent is now estopped from taking up a

3 Vide paragraph 6 at page 317 of the brief.

4 Vide the said return at pages 195-198 of the brief.

different position when it comes to Turnover Tax, which is

against the doctrine of approbate and reprobate.

I need to stress two matters on that point.

One is, as the appellant has stated in the written submissions

which I quoted above, Economic Service Charge shall be paid on

the turnover of every trade and business whereas the Turnover

Tax shall be paid only on the sale by wholesale or retail of any

goods. Hence those two cannot be equalised.

The other is, the said return in respect of Economic Service

Charge for the quarter 2008/09(1) had later been found by the

respondent to be on the wrong turnout. Hence the respondent

has by letter dated 06.08.2008 made an appeal for a refund.5

The impugned Notice of Assessment X18 is dated 10.09.2008, a

date subsequent to the said appeal. Hence the appellant cannot

base his case on the said (erroneous) return in relation to

Economic Service Charge.

The respondent in paragraph 14 of his counter affidavit whilst

tendering supporting documents has stated that, in respect of

Economic Service Charge for the quarters 2008/09(2),

2008/09(3), 2008/09(4), 2009/10(1), the respondent filed

returns on the correct basis, which is, the commission received

by the respondent from the Principal for his services as a

Commission Agent, and they have been accepted by the

Department of Inland Revenue. This has not been denied by the

appellant.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the appeal without costs.
