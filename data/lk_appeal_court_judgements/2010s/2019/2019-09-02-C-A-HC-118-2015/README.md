The Accused-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 29.07.2015 in case No. HCE

273/2006.

Facts of the case:

The accused - appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was indicted in

the High Court of Embilipitiya for causing death of one Kadawathagama

Arachchilage Jayawardana on or about 13.04.2002, an offence punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant was

convicted for Murder and was sentenced to death on 26.1l.20 1 O. Thereafter, the

appellant preferred an appeal to this Court and the Court decided to send the case

back for re-trial since the appellant was not given a jury option at the beginning of

the trial. Accordingly, a fresh trial commenced on 29.07.2013 and the Learned

Page 2 of8

High Court Judge by the judgment dated 29.07.2015, convicted the appellant for

Murder and sentenced him to death.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 29.07.2015, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The Leamed Trial Judge has not properly evaluated the evidence of the eye

witness, Amarasinghege Indrani

2. The evidence of the witness Indrani is not constant and does not corroborate

with the evidence of the Judicial Medical officer

3. The 27(1) recovery of the production has not been proved beyond reasonable

doubt

4. The evidence available is not sufficient to convict the appellant for a capital

punishment

It is observed that the prosecution called 07 witnesses for the prosecution case

whereas the appellant made a dock statement and concluded the case for defence.

The prosecution led the evidence of an eye witness, namely Amarasinghege

Indrani, who was the wife of the deceased. As per the evidence of said Indrani

(hereinafter referred to as the 'PW 0 I '), the appellant is the son of her mother's

brother. The appellant and the deceased were employed in the same place as

masons in Deniyaya. The PW 01 testified that, about one week prior to the incident

in question, the appellant visited her and told that the deceased was having an

affair with another woman. Thereafter, the appellant pulled the hand of the PW 01

and she had shut him out of the house. She later had informed this incident to the

deceased when he returned home. On the date of the incident, the PW 0 I and the

deceased had heard footsteps outside their house when they were getting ready to

Page 3 of8

sleep. The deceased had gone out with a torch and a club whereas the PW 01

followed him with a bottle lamp. Both of them had gone around the house and the

deceased stopped in front of the house to observe a ditch that was in the

compound. The witness had heard a noise similar to a cracker when the deceased

bent down to inspect the said ditch. At the same time of the noise of the cracker,

the deceased had fallen. The PW 01 had seen the appellant with a gun in hand as

she looked towards where the noise came. She had seen him about 10 to 12 feet

away from the direction she heard the firing. Thereafter, the PW 01 had seen the

appellant was leaving with a gun in his hand. Even though the PW 01 raised cries,

nobody came to help and therefore she ran with her child to the house of her

mother who was living in a very close distance. The PW 01 further testified that

she heard another shot being fired while she was running towards the house of the

mother.

As per the evidence of the PW 02 (the mother of the PW 01), on the date of the

incident, the PW 01 came running to her house shouting that the appellant shot the

deceased.

The Judicial Medical Officer (PW 06) testified that there had been 07 injuries on

the deceased's body caused by firearm injuries. There had been an entry wound on

the face of the deceased and a bullet had been found in the brain. There had been

injuries on the neck and chest and corresponding exit wounds which fractured the

ribs of the deceased. It was further explained that the brain, lungs and bones were

damaged due to these injuries. The JMO further testified that these wounds could

be inflicted even from a single firing and the said injuries were capable of causing

instantaneous death. (Page 498 & 499 of the brief)

Page 4 of 8

Two investigation officers testified with regard to the receiving of the complaint,

inspection of the crime scene and recovery of the weapon used for the offence,

upon a statement made by the appellant.

I wish to consider grounds of appeal 01, 02 and 04 together. All these grounds of

appeal address the issue of evaluating the evidence. The Learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge has not properly evaluated the

evidence of the eye witness Indrani and her evidence does not corroborate with the

evidence ofthe Judicial Medical officer.

It is imperative to note that the Learned High Court Judge has thoroughly

evaluated each and every contradiction marked in the testimony of the PW 01, by

the defence. The Learned High Court Judge made the following observation with

regard to the evidence of the PW 01;

" ... 5zsitl", 58Z51' @ ~J2SiQ", C'!l-E:iO!5)J tJ)J o6eOo6!5)J CD-E:i025'lJEl2Si <;2SiElJ tl-E:iO<;

Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge made the following observation;

" ... 5zsitl2Sl~ ~@o ~62Sl 88 @Elc)zsi 0l.~J. 01 5825i ~Z51' ~J2SiQ", @@El<;JS

tJ)~25'lJ CD1~<; Ele:lJzsi @tJ)J~25i !5)tJ)~~ 5@ ... " (Page 596 of the brief)

I observe that the JMO testified that there had been 07 injuries on the deceased's

body caused by firearm injuries and there were burning marks around the entry

wound on the face of the deceased. Accordingly, the JMO was of the opinion that

such burning marks could be found when firing was taken place within a close

Page 5 of8

proximity of 02-03 meters (Page 495 of the brief). The PW 01 testified that the

appellant was standing of a distance of 10 - 12 feet from the deceased at the time

of firing. Therefore, the evidence of the PW 01 tallies with the findings of the

JMO. Accordingly, the Learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion that the

evidence of the PW 01 was reliable and in fact corroborated with the medical

evidence. Further, it is noteworthy that the identification of the appellant by the

PW 01 was not challenged and even the PW 02 testified that the PW 01 mentioned

about the appellant to her.

In the case of Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka (2010) 2 Sri LR 241, it was

held that,

"Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge. Court of

appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of trial Judge with regard to the

credibility of a witness unless such findings are manifestly wrong. This is

because the trial Judge has the advantage of seeing the demeanour and

deportment of the witness ... "

In the case of The AG V. Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2 Sri L.R. 144, it was

observed that,

"When faced with contradictions in a witness's testimonial, the court must

bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions, viwed in light

of the whole of the evidence given by the witness. The court must also come

to a determination regarding whether this contradiction was an honest

mistake on the part of the witness or whether it was a deliberate attempt

to mislead court ... "

Page 6of8

In the case of A.K.K. Rasika Amarasinghe V. Officer-in-Charge, Special

Investigation Unit and another [S.C. Appeal 140/2010 -decided on

18.07.2018], it was held that,

"We note that learned Magistrate who heard the case has considered all the

above contradictions and the learned High Court Judge has also considered

the said contradictions. We note that the learned Magistrate who heard the

case has convicted the Accused. Therefore the learned Magistrate who saw

the deportment and demeanor of the witnesses has the opportunity to assess

the evidence ... "

In light of above, it is understood that an appellate court shall not disturb findings

of a trial Judge unless such finding is manifestly wrong. I observe that the Learned

High Court Judge, in the instant case, had the opportunity of hearing the whole

trial from the very beginning and had the advantage of observing the demeanour

and deportment of witnesses who testified before him. Upon perusal of the

proceedings and the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge, I am satisfied that

the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly evaluated the evidence placed

before him (Page 593 to 599 of the brief) and therefore, the above mentioned three

grounds of appeal should fail.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the 27(1) recovery of the

production has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The PW 08 testified that

he recovered the gun used for the commission of this offence, subsequent to a

statement made by the appellant. The relevant portion of the said statement was

marked as 'P.02". The PW 08 further testified that the gun was in working

condition and he even smelt the gun powder at the time he recovered the weapon. I

observe that the defence was unable to mark any contradiction or omissions in the

testimony of the PW 08, other than making several suggestions in the cross-

Page 7 of 8

examination that the said recovery of the weapon subsequent to the statement of

the appellant was false. Therefore, I see no merits in the above ground of appeal

for the appellant.

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was

correct in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the appellant, by the Learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is hereby dismissed.
