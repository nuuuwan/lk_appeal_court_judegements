K. PRIY ANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. I" to 5th Accused Appellants (Appellants) were indicted in the High

Court ofBadulla on the following counts;

Count No. I: Against all 5 Appellants, offence punishable under

Section 315 of the Penal Code.

Count No.2: Against all 5 Appellants, offence punishable under

Section 357 of the Penal Code.

Counts No.3, 4, 5, 6, 7: Against I '\ 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Appellants

respectively, offence punishable under

Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code.

02. After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted all Accused Appellants

for a lesser offence punishable under section 314 of the Penal Code on

count No.1 and convicted all Appellants on count No.2. On count No.3, 1st

Appellant was convicted for a lesser offence punishable under section 365

b (2) a of the Penal Code. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Appellants were convicted on

counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively. All appellants were sentenced

accordingly.

03. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentences, the Appellants

preferred the instant appeal. At the argument the following four grounds of

appeal were urged by the counsel for the Appellants.

I. The learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the medical evidence

properly.

3

2. The learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the dock statements of

the Appellants properly.

3. The learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the contradiction marked

as V7.

4. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the possibility of a false

allegation against the Appellants.

04. Main witness the prosecution relied on is the alleged victim of rape

Kandaiah Manjula. At the time of the incident she had been about 19 years

of age and at the time she gave evidence she had been 26. According to her

evidence she had been living in the line room with her brother, sister, sister

in law and their children. There had been about fourteen-line houses and

the line house of the 2 nd Appellant had been the 3rd from their house. All 5

Appellants had come around 9.30 pm asking for her brother. As her brother

had not been at home at that time, the Appellants had gone back and had

come again after some time. They had been carrying weapons like knives

and axes.

05. As they all came inside the house, they had assaulted her sister. Then,

according to her, she was assaulted on her head with a knife. Then she had

felt dizzy. She was then dragged to the line house of the 2nd Appellant. Her

hands were tied and a piece of cloth was put in her mouth to prevent her

from shouting. All five Appellants had sexually assaulted her taking turns.

She could not remember the order the Appellants sexually assaulted her

when they took turns. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Appellants had raped her and 1st

Appellant had sexually assaulted her. After raping her, the 2nd Appellant had

dropped her home. She had made a complaint to the police the same night.

4

06. Grounds of appeal I to 4 will be considered together. Counsel for the

Appellant submitted that the injuries observed by the Medical Officer are

consistent with a fight. The contention of the counsel for the Appellants is

that in their dock statements, Appellants admitted that there was a fight

between the families. No fresh injuries were observed in the vagina. No

semen in the vagina was observed by the doctor, although the Complainant

was examined by the doctor the following day. Counsel further submitted

that the Complainant lied in Court about her previous sexual behavior.

07. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the learned Trial Judge has

rightly laid down the position of the dock statements. Further it was

submitted that according to the Medical Officer, the injuries he observed on

the Complainant is consistent with the history given by her.

08. Complainant had been consistent when she related the short history to the

doctor (PW3) who examined her. PW3 had observed 5 injuries on the

Complainant. There had been an old healed rupture in the hymen that was

consistent with sexual intercourse that had occurred some time ago. PW3

gave clear evidence that the other 5 injuries he observed are fresh ones and

injuries No. 4 and 5 can cause by pressing with hands. As her hymen was

already ruptured, intercourse by 5 men without her consent could happen

without injuries to the vagina being caused, provided she let them do it due

to fear, PW3 testified.

09. The evidence of the Complainant was clear and consistent. She had made

the complaint to the police the same night without delay. She also had told

the doctor who examined her the following day. Her evidence was that she

was dazed after she was hit on the head. It is natural that she could not have

5

been in a state to struggle with the Appellants due to her injury to her head.

Physical resistance may have been limited due to her injuries.

10. Complainant said in her evidence, the sexual acts performed on her by each

Appellant. She testified that she could not remember the numerical order of

the Appellants who sexually assaulted her. Her evidence was recorded in

Court after a lapse of about 7 years. As stated in case of Bharwada

Bhoginbltai Hirjibltai V. State of Gujarat 1983 AIR 753, a witness cannot

be expected to possess a photographic memory and recall the details of an

incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.

II. The Appellants have made very short dock statements merely denying the

charge and admitting that there was a quarrel. The learned Trial Judge in

page 17 of his Judgment has analyzed the dock statements of the

Appellants. PW2 gave clear evidence that the I Sl to 4th Appellants took the

Complainant to 2nd Appellant's house. When she heard the Complainant

screaming, she had come out of her house. She had not gone to help the

Complainant due to fear.

12. Complainant in her evidence has denied that she had sexual intercourse with

anybody prior to this incident. However, the medical evidence proved

otherwise. It is quite natural for a young unmarried girl in our culture to be

reluctant to expose her sexual activities, more so sexual intercourse. In the

circumstances, denying having previous sexual intercourse with any man,

under cross examination, would not in any way affect her credibility.

13. In case of Samaraweera V. Attorney General {1990J 1 Sri L.R at page 260,

referring to the maximfalsus in uno falsus in omnibus Court said;

6

'Where however the maxim set out above is applicable it

must be borne in mind that all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors

of memory, faulty observation or lack of skill in observation upon

any point or points, exaggeration or mere embroidery or

embellishment must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood. '

14. The learned Trial Judge has sufficiently reasoned out as to why this would

not affect the credibility of the Complainant at pages 24 and 25 of his

Judgment.

Hence, the learned Trial Judge has rightly accepted the evidence of the

Complainant, rejecting the defence.

15. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the contradiction marked as V7 in

the evidence of the Complainant was not considered by the Trial Judge. V7

contradiction refers to the sexual act done by the 1 sl Appellant. Counsel for

the Appellants in the High Court has cross examined the Complainant at

length on the sexual acts performed by each of the Appellants and also on

her previous sexual activities. Learned High Court Judge has recorded that

the Complainant was feeling faintish in Court. (Page 70 ofthe brief)

16. Question No. 7 from the top of page 71 of the brief which led to

contradiction V7 that was put to the Complainant in cross examination is

clearly unfair and misleading.

17. Upon that questioning V7 contradiction was marked. It is clear that what

was put to her as she said in examination in chief was not what she said in

Court (page 57 of the brief). What she said in examination in chief on the

acts committed by 151 Appellant was;

c: wD.

c: wD.

18. Therefore, it is clear that the questions put to her had been misleading and

unfair. It is for the Trial Judge to decide whether the evidence of the witness

read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

In case of Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka f2010j 2 Sri L.R. 241

Court said;

8

'Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the Trial

Judge. Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of Trial

Judge with regard to the credibility of a witness unless such

findings are manifestly wrong. This is because the trial Judge has

the advantage of seeing the demeanour and deportment of the

witness ... '

19. The learned High Court Judge in his Judgment has carefully considered the

evidence adduced before him and given good and sufficient reasons to

accept the evidence of the Complainant as credible. I have no reason to

interfere with the findings of the learned Trial Judge. I find no merit in all

grounds of appeal urged by the Appellants and all grounds of appeal should

necessarily fail.

Convictions and the sentences imposed on the Appellants by the learned

High Court Judge are affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
