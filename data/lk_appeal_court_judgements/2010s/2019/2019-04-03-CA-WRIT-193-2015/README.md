1. Introduction

The petitioner Trade Union filed this application against the

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) seeking to quash by way of

certiorari the decision contained in the Circular No.

2014/GM/46/Pers dated 27.11.2014 marked P11 whereby a

category known as Unified Engineering Service was created and

a special salary scale known as E Salary Scale was introduced

for the Engineers and Engineering Assistants in the CEB. The

petitioner says that this is unmistakably illegal and arbitrary,

which created a great salary anomaly between the Engineering

employees and the other employees of the CEB gravely

endangering industrial peace.

The 1st respondent CEB and the other respondent Trade Unions

supporting the Engineers filed objections and tendered written

submissions against the petitioners application. The remaining

respondents including Ministers of Power and Energy, Finance,

3

and National Pay Commission filed objections and tendered

written submissions, in support of the petitioners application.

2. Merits of the Application

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the contesting

respondents took up several preliminary objections seeking

dismissal of the application in limine without going into the

merits. To understand the said preliminary objections in the

proper perspective, it is necessary to know the facts of the case.

Hence I decide to consider the merits of the application first.

2.1. The Crucial Board Meeting of CEB on 26.11.2014

A Board Meeting of the Ceylon Electricity Board was held on

26.11.2014 at 4.00 pmvide P5. The Minutes of this Board

Meeting is crucial to decide this matter. The said Minutes under

the heading PROGRESS OF THE PROPOSED COLLECTIVE

AGREEMENT AND THE SALARY INCREASE FOR THE

EMPLOYEES OF THE CEB read as follows:

Before the commencement of the formal proceedings of the

meeting the Chairman brought to the notice of the meeting the

present position of the progress of the proposed Collective

Agreement and the salary increase for the employees of the

CEB. He appraised the Board that he continued to further

negotiated settlement on the proposed Collective Agreement

and the salary increase.

After extensive negotiations with the Trade Unions at several

occasions the Management was able to get the consent of most

of the Trade Unions for a salary increase of 30% and to retain

4

LKR 1,000/= monthly allowance which is being paid for the

last several years. The committee has also proposed to

increase the annual bonus of 1 month salary by 50% (1

months salary) with effect from January 01, 2015 for the next

3 years.

The Board after careful consideration of the contents of the

proposed Collective Agreement and 30% increase of salary and

the proposed bonus decided to consider them favourably as

against the following.

(i) Improvement of overall efficiency and enhancement of

productivity of services by the employees arising out the

proposed salary increase.

(ii) Financial position of the CEB during the coming 3 years

will be satisfactory due to low expenditure resulting from

the low cost generation through coal power and improved

hydro situation.

(iii) Adoption of performance appraisal scheme within the

organization has been improved and will continue to

maintain a higher standard of customer service.

(iv) Entering into Collective Agreement at least with a limited

scope is a remarkable achievement in maintaining the

industrial peace within the CEB during the next 3 year

period.

In view of the above the Board decided to accept the proposed

Collective Agreement which includes the above mentioned

salary and bonus increase and recommend to the

Secretary/Ministry of Power and Energy, Secretary/Ministry

5

of Finance and Planning and the Cabinet of Ministers for

approval.

The following can be deducible from the above Minutes:

a) There shall be a consensus between the Board and the

Trade Unions for a salary hike, which shall be included in

the Collective Agreement to maintain industrial peace

within the CEB (which happens one in three years), and;

b) If there is such a consensus, for it to take effect, the

approvals from the Secretary/Ministry of Power and

Energy, Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Planning, and

the Cabinet of Ministers are necessary.

Further, according to the said Minutes, the Committee has

proposed salary increase of 30%, retaining of LKR 1,000/=

monthly allowance and increasement of annual bonus by 50%,

with effect from 01.01.2015-31.12.2017.

This has been incorporated in the Collective Agreement marked

P6 signed on 01.12.2014 for the period 01.01.2015-31.12.2017

between the CEB and the Trade Unions of the CEB including the

petitioner.

What is the Committee above referred to? That is the

Committee on Salary Revision of CEB Employees-2015

appointed by the Chairman of the CEB comprising of five

Members, as per 1R9, to consider Next salary revision due from

01st of January 2015, which need to be processed through the

proposed Collective Agreement. Professor Perera, Vice

6

Chairman of the CEB has been appointed as the Chairman of

the Committee.

2.2. Unusual Decisions soon after the Main Decision

After the said decisions (subject to the approvals) by the Board

inter alia for 30% salary increase across the board effective from

01.01.2015 for the next three years, the Minutes of the same

day, under the heading UNIFIED SERVICES IN THE CEB, read

as follows:

During the discussion Chairman sought instructions from

the Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy with regard to

Engineering Scale issue and in response Secretary, Ministry

of Power and Energy advised that this request may be

considered positively and requested the Board to consider

setting up a Unified Service for Technical, Financial IT and

other professional grades and further requested the Vice

Chairman to submit a report on this matter based on his

committee report dated November 18, 2014, urgently.

Accordingly, an addendum to the committee report was

submitted to the Board by the Chairman of the committee

Prof. K.K.C.K. Perera, Vice Chairman, before the Board

Meeting was adjourned for the day. The Board considered

the contents of the addendum along with the committee

report submitted to the Board on November 18, 2014 and

requested the GM to issue the necessary circular

instructions accordingly as recommended in the addendum

dated November 26, 2014 submitted by the Vice Chairman

7

and directed the Vice Chairman to submit further proposal

with regard to other professional services as well.

The Committee Report above referred to is the Report of the

Committee on Salary Revision of CEB Employees-2015 marked

1R10, and Addendum is 1R11.

It is noteworthy that in the said Committee Report 1R10, the

proposed E Salary Scale by the Engineers Union has neither

been recommended nor approved but only accepted as a policy.

In Annexure 6 thereof, it is particularly mentioned that, the

proposed E Salary Scale for the Engineers is a matter to be

considered separately, and it is beyond their mandate to make

recommendations on the E Salary Scale.

In the first place, I must say that, soon after the Board decided

to accept the proposed Collective Agreement for 01.01.2015-

31.12.2017 (P6), which included the 30% salary increase across

the board subject to the approval of the Secretary/Ministry of

Power and Energy, Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Planning,

and the Cabinet of Ministers, the Board cannot, immediately

thereafter, and out of the blue, hurriedly formulate another

salary revision for the Engineers. That is plainly ultra vires.

According the said Minutes under the heading UNIFIED

SERVICES IN THE CEB, the following very unusual things have

happened in the Board Room while the Board Meeting in

progress.

a) The Chairman of the Board has taken instructions,

During the discussion at the Board Meeting, from the

8

Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy regarding

Engineering Salary Scale issue.

It may be noted that, according to the Minutes, Board

Meeting started late in the evening at 4.00 pm, and this

has happenedpresumably at night, after main business

of the Board Meeting under the heading PROGRESS OF

THE PROPOSED COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT AND THE

SALARY INCREASE FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CEB

was over.

b) The Vice Chairman of the CEB (who was the Chairman of

the Committee on Salary Revision of CEB Employees-

2015) has been asked to submit a Report on the

Engineering Salary Scale urgently. The Vice Chairman

also would have been attending the Board Meeting.

c) Then the Vice Chairman has, in a great hurry, prepared

the addendum 1R11 recommending a separate salary

scale known as E Salary Scale for Engineers and

Engineering Assistants before the Board Meeting was

adjourned for the day! That means, without consulting

the other Members of the Committee.

It may be recalled that this Committee was appointed to

consider Next salary revision due from 01st of January

2015 for the next three years, and the Committee had

already by their Report 1R10 has informed the Board that

the proposed E Salary Scale for the Engineers is a matter

to be considered separately, and it is beyond their

mandate to make recommendations on the E Salary

9

Scale notwithstanding the Committee accepts it as a

policy.

This decision to create a new salary scale only for the Engineers

has been given effect to by the Circular No. 2014/GM/46/Pers

purportedly dated the following day, i.e. 27.11.2014 marked

P11. Why I stated purportedly dated 27.11.2014 was because

this has been first made known by way of an email on

08.01.2015 marked P10(a), i.e. on the date of the Presidential

Election. This Board Meeting was held and the Circular was

dated after the nominations for the Presidential Election were

called on 21.11.2014. The modus operandi is clear.

When P6 Collective Agreement was signed on 01.12.2014

between the CEB and the Trade Unions including the

petitioners one, they were unaware of this salary revision

contained in P11!

According to the first part of the Minutes under the heading

PROGRESS OF THE PROPOSED COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT AND

THE SALARY INCREASE FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CEB,

the Board recommendation or decision alone is not enough for a

salary increase, the approval of inter alia the Minister of Power

and Energy, Minister of Finance and Planning, and also the

Cabinet of Ministers is necessary.

The 2nd respondent-Minister of Power and Energy, 36th

respondent-National Salaries and Carder Commission, 37th and

38th respondents-Minister of Finance and its Secretary, 15th-36th

respondents-National Pay Commission by their statements of

objections/written submissions/document marked CA1 to the

10

Counter Affidavit state in unison that their approvals were not

taken for the said Special Salary Scale for the Engineers. How

can the CEB then enforce the E Salary Scale except by force?

How can they enforce it without it being incorporated in the

relevant Collective Agreement P6?

I do not say for a moment that creation of a Unified Engineering

Service and a special salary scale known as E Salary Scale for

Engineers is outrageous. They can be distinctly treated in terms

of salary and otherwise for the unique nature of their duties in

the CEB. Comparison of an officer in Class II Grade II of the

Engineering Service with that of in the same Class and Grade of

any other service of the CEB may be highly unreasonable. But

there is a procedure to do it. That procedure has outrageously

been violated by the CEB in this instance when they arbitrarily

created Unified Engineering Service and a special salary scale

known as E Salary Scale for Engineers. I have no scintilla

doubt that, on merits, the petitioner must succeed in this

application.

3. Technical Objections

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st respondent-CEB and

the 12th respondent-Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union

have taken up several technical objections to the maintainability

of this application.

Despite the petitioner being entitled to succeed on merits, is the

petitioner disentitled to the relief on those technical objections?

11

3.1. Locus Standi

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 12th respondent-Ceylon

Electricity Board Engineers Union, in his ingenuity, strenuously

argues, as a threshold matter, that the petitioner being a Trade

Union has no locus standi to file this application. It appears

that this argument has not been mounted in writ applications

before.

The learned Presidents Counsel relies on The Ceylon Mercantile

Union v. The Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka (1977) 80 NLR

309, Environmental Foundation Limited v. Urban Development

Authority of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 Sri LR 123, Ceylon Electricity

Board Accounts Association v. Minister of Power and Energy (SC

FR No.18/2015 decided on 03.05.2016) in support. In my view,

those three cases have no application to the case at hand.

The first one, The Ceylon Mercantile Union v. The Insurance

Corporation of Sri Lanka (1977) 80 NLR 309, is a case filed by a

Trade Union in the District Court on an alleged violation of a

contract by the defendant corporation. Sharvananda J. (later

C.J.) at pages 313-314 first recognized the quasi corporate state

given to a Trade Union by statute in this manner:

In this case, the plaintiff is a registered Trade Union. While

it is not a legal person, it is endowed by the legislature with

many rights characteristic of a Corporationrights which an

unincorporated Corporation does not possess. It can own

property through its trustees. (Section 42 of the Trade Union

Ordinance, Chap. 138). A registered Trade Union may sue

or be sued in its registered name (section 30). Every Trade

12

Union shall be liable on any contract entered into by it or by

any agent acting on its behalf (section 28). It can be sued

by its own member for wrongful expulsion, i.e. breach of

contract. (Bonsor v. Musicians Union (1956) AC 104; (1955)

AER 518) A registered Trade Union might sue in its own

name for defamation where the defamatory statement

touches its collective reputation. (General and Municipal

Workers v. Gillian (1945) 2 All ER 593) A registered Trade

Union may thus be described as having been given a quasi

corporate status by the legislature which has however

carefully avoided conferring corporate personality on a

Trade Union. A registered Trade Union has thus been given

recognition by law as a body distinct from individuals who

from time to time compose it, although it is an

unincorporated body. By registration, the Trade Union

acquires some existence in law apart from the members. It

is thus a statutory legal entity capable of rights and duties.

A Trade Union (which is a body unincorporate) is a

separate entity. per Lord Denning in Willis v. Association of

Universities (1964) 2 All ER 39 at 42.

Then it is clear that the attempt to equalize a Trade Union with a

Partnership on the basis that both are unincorporated bodies is

not entitled to succeed. A Partnership has no such legal

recognition where the members of a Partnership are personally

liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. A

Partnership is not at all a separate entity like a Trade Union

before the eyes of the law.

Having stated so, Sharvananda J. posed the pertinent question:

13

The question that arises in this case is whether the plaintiff-

Union has, as a quasi-Corporation, a cause of action which

would entitle it to the declaratory judgment prayed for.

Thereafter the following answer was given:

The plaintiff is an Association having as its members,

among others, 77 percent of the non-executive staff of the

defendant-Corporation, each one of whom entered into

individual contracts with the defendant-Corporation on the

basis of the specimen agreement referred to as X and Y.

But the plaintiff-Union has as such not entered into any

such contract. The dispute complained of in the plaint is the

dispute of each member with the Corporation. The plaintiff-

Union has no direct interest in the said dispute. In the

circumstances, it has no locus standi at all and is not

entitled to come to Court for any relief based on the

contracts of its members.

Then at page 315 it was held that:

Thus, though the legislature is aware of the status and

function of a Trade Union, it has to date failed to make

statutory provision for a registered Trade Union to represent

its members in civil proceedings in a Court of Law.

It is then abundantly clear that the Supreme Court decided that

the plaintiff Trade Union had no locus standi to institute that

action in the District Court because the plaintiff did not have a

cause of action against the defendant. The instant action, which

is a writ application, is clearly distinguishable.

14

One does not need to have a cause of action accrued to him as

in a civil action, to file a writ application, which is a public law

remedy. Civil Procedure Code has no applicability in writ

applications. Writ application is not a civil action. It was held by

the majority of the Supreme Court in Silverline Bus Co. Ltd. v.

Kandy Omnibus Co. Ltd. (1956) 58 NLR 193 that an application

for a writ of certiorari does not fall within the ambit of the

expression civil suit or action.

The other two cases, Environmental Foundation Limited v. Urban

Development Authority of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 Sri LR 123 and

Ceylon Electricity Board Accounts Association v. Minister of

Power and Energy (SC FR No.18/2015 decided on 03.05.2016),

are Fundamental Right Applications filed under Article 126(2) of

the Constitution. Article 126(2) reads as follows:

Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right

or language right relating to such person has been infringed

or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative

action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on his

behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such

rules of Court as may be in force, apply to the Supreme

Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such Court

praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement.

Such application may be proceeded with only with leave to

proceed first had and obtained from the Supreme Court,

which leave may be granted or refused, as the case may

be, by not less than two judges.

15

Environmental Foundation Limited v. Urban Development

Authority of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 Sri LR 123, S.N. Silva C.J.

extended the word person to include incorporated bodies.

In Ceylon Electricity Board Accounts Association v. Minister of

Power and Energy (SC FR No.18/2015 decided on 03.05.2016),

Sripavan C.J. stated that the Court has extended the meaning of

person to incorporated bodies by judicial decisions. I am unable

to extend the meaning of person to unincorporated bodies like a

trade union as that was never the intention of the legislature.

Therefore it was held that a Trade Union has no locus standi to

file a Fundamental Right Application. As I will explain later,

Fundamental right jurisdiction is different from writ jurisdiction.

For whatever it is worth, I must mention that, section 2(s) of the

Interpretation Ordinance, No. 21 of 1901, as amended, states

that: In this Ordinance and in every written law, whether made

before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, unless there

be something repugnant in the subject or context person

includes any body of persons corporate or unincorporate. And

also, there are instances where the Trade Unions have

successfully filed Fundamental Rights Applicationsvide for

example, Augustine Perera v. Richard Pathirana, Minister of

Education [2003] 1 Sri LR 125.

Be that as it may, writ jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court

by Article 140 of the Constitution. It reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of

Appeal shall have full power and authority to inspect and

examine the records of any Court of first instance or

16

tribunal or other institution and grant and issue, according

to law, orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the

judge of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other

institution or any other person.

Unlike Article 126(2) of the Constitution where the word

person has been given a unique place, in Article 140, there is

no personalization of the application, or rather the applicant.

The word person has no place in Article 140. The word

person used there at the end is referable not to the applicant,

but to the person against whom writ is sought.

In Sri Lanka, fundamental right jurisdiction exists apart from

and independent of writ jurisdiction where the latter is exercised

independently by the Court of Appeal subject to appeal to the

Supreme Court, and the former exclusively by the Supreme

Court. Fundamental right jurisdiction is invoked in relation to

violation of fundamental rights expressly stated in the

Constitution whereas the writ jurisdiction is, broadly speaking,

invoked to control the power of the bodies, which discharge

duties of public nature. The acts complained of in a writ

application do not necessarily give rise to complain of violation

of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

In Pathirana v. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police) [2006]

2 Sri LR 281 at 284-285, Sriskandarajah J. stated:

In applications for writs the courts have relaxed the rules of

standing even wider than the rules of standing in

17

fundamental rights applications in order to ensure good

administration.

In Shell Gas v. Consumer Affairs Authority CAM

22.08.2014, Marsoof J. (P/CA) observed:

Courts in Sri Lanka as well as in other jurisdictions have

liberally interpreted rules of standing in regard to matters of

vital concern to society....Time and time again, our Courts

have repeated that the fact that the irregularity or the

grievance for which redress is sought is shared by a large

number of people or society as a whole would not prevent

one of the many affected persons from seeking relief from

the court. There can be no doubt that a consumer such as

the intervenient-petitioner will have locus standi to

challenge an order or action of a statutory body such as the

Consumer Affairs Authority in an appropriate case.

An association or group that seeks to represent some or all

of its members were also said to have standing in relation

to the matters affecting the interest of their members;

Consumers Association of Lanka v. Telecommunications

Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and others [2006] 1 Sri

LR 174. In Jayathilaka v. Jeevan Kumarathunga and

Others CA 1312/2004-BASL News August 2004 a person

who has a long standing association and interest in a

particular field such as sports was given standing to

challenge an appointment of the Chef De Mission for

Olympic Games. A movement called Green Movement of Sri

Lanka was given standing in C.A. (writ) Application No.

18

2047/2003 C.A. Minutes 06.06.2006 where the Green

Movement of Sri Lanka having the objects of preserving the

environment and natural resources of Sri Lanka, instituted

proceedings on the complaint of the villagers who are

directly affected but do not have sufficient resources to

present their grievance before a court of law.

In Wanasinghe and others (Citizens Movement for Good

Governance) v. University of Colombo [2006] 3 Sri LR 322 at 327-

329 also Sriskandarajah J. took the same view.

Who can file a writ application? The short answer isany

person (as defined in section 2(s) of the Interpretation

Ordinance) who has sufficient interest as opposed to the

outdated requirement of personal interest because of the

element of public interest. This includes a Trade Union. High-

flown technical objections regarding locus standi have no place

in the modern administrative law. (Vide Wijesiri v. Siriwardene

[1982] 1 Sri LR 171, Perera v. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka

[2006] 1 Sri LR 83, Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority [2003] 3 Sri LR 146, Premadasa v. Wijewardena [1991]

1 Sri LR 333, Vasudeva Nanayakkara v. Governor, Central Bank

of Sri Lanka [2009] BLR 41)

In Wijesiri v. Siriwardene [1982] 1 Sri LR 171, Wimalaratne J. on

behalf of the Supreme Court at page 175 stated:

In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the views

of an eminent jurist on the question of locus standi. Soon

after the decision of the Privy Council in Durayappah Vs.

Fernando (1967) 3 WLR 289, in an Article entitled Unlawful

19

Administrative Action in (1967) 83 L.O.R. 499, H. W. R.

Wade expressed the view that one of the merits of Certiorari

is that it is not subject to narrow rules about Locus standi,

but is available even to strangers, as the Courts have often

held, because of the element of public interest. In other

words it is a genuine remedy of public law, and all the more

valuable for that reason (at p. 504). As regards the

applications for Mandamus they should, in his view, in

principle be no more exacting than it is in the case of the

other prerogative remedies, because public authorities

should be compellable to perform their duties, as a matter

of public interest at the instance of any person genuinely

concerned; and in suitable case, subject always to

discretion, the Court should be able to award the remedy on

the application of a public spirited citizen who has no other

interest than a due regard for the observance of the

law-Wade-Administrative Law (4th Ed) 608. The result of a

restrictive doctrine of standing, therefore, would be to

encourage the government to break the law; yet this is

exactly what the prerogative writs should be able to prevent

(p. 609). To restrict Mandamus to cases of personal legal

right would in effect make it a private law remedy (p 610).

These observations, with which I am in respectful

agreement, appear to make the second requirement,

insisted upon by Tambiah J. i.e.: some personal interest in

the matter complained of, unnecessary. But the first

requirement ought, in my view, to be satisfied and it is

satisfied if the applicant can show a genuine interest in the

matter complained of, and that he comes before Court as a

20

public-spirited citizen concerned to see that the law is

obeyed in the interest of all, and not merely as a busy body

perhaps with a view to gain cheap publicity. As to whether

an applicant satisfies this second requirement will depend

on the facts of each case.

In Perera v. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka [2006] 1 Sri LR

83 at 89-90, Marsoof J. stated:

As Lord Denning noted in R v. Inland Revenue

Commissioners ex p. National Federation of Self Employed

and Small Business Ltd., (1982) AC 617 English Courts

have orchestrated the generous view that if there is good

ground for supposing that a government department or

public authority is transgressing the law, or is about to

transgress it, in a way which offends or injures thousands

of her Majesty's subjects, then anyone of those offended or

injured can draw it to the attention of the court of law and

seek to have the law enforced. In the course of his

judgment in the same case, Lord Diplock observed as

followsIt would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our

system of public law if a pressure group, like the federation,

or even a single public spirited taxpayer, were prevented by

outdated technical rules of locus standi from bringing the

matter to the attention of court to vindicate the rule of law

and get the unlawful conduct stopped."

The change in legal policy reflected in the decision of the

House of Lords in this case was considered by Lord Diplock

to be a major step towards a comprehensive system of

21

administrative law which he regarded as the greatest

achievement of the English Courts during his life time.

The rationale for the expanding canvas of locus standi in

the context of certiorari and prohibition was explained by

H.W.R. Wade-Administrative Law (8th Edition) pages 362 to

363 in the following words-

The prerogative remedies, being of a public character as

emphasized earlier, have always had more liberal rules

about standing than the remedies of private law.

Prerogative remedies are granted at the suit of the Crown,

as the titles of the cases show; and the Crown always has

standing to take action against public authorities, including

its own ministers, who act or threaten to act unlawfully. As

Devlin J said: Orders of certiorari and prohibition are

concerned principally with public order, it being the duty of

the High Court to see that inferior courts confine themselves

to their own limited sphere. In the same sense Brett J. had

said in an earlier case that the question in granting

prohibition is not whether the individual suitor has or has

not suffered damage, but is, whether the royal prerogative

has been encroached upon by reason of the prescribed

order of administration of justice having been disobeyed.

Consequently the court is prepared to act at the instance of

a mere stranger, though it retains discretion to refuse to do

so if it considers that no good would be done to the public.

Wade further goes on to observe at page 683 that-the

House of Lords is clearly now determined to prevent

22

technicalities from impeding judicial review so as to protect

illegalities and derelictions committed by public

authorities.

Sri Lankan Courts too have been quick to recognize

standing of any citizen to seek relief against public

authorities that stray outside their legitimate bounds.

The question whether a Trade Union can file a writ application

has been answered by Professor Wade (Administrative Law, 9th

Edition, page 686) positively in the following manner:

Lord Denning added: The court would not listen, of course,

to a mere busybody who was interfering in things which

did not concern him. But it will listen to any one whose

interests are affected by what has been done. The same

tendency is illustrated by the courts willingness to grant

certiorari to a trade union acting on behalf of one of its

members [as] in Minister of Social Security v. Amalgamated

Engineering Union [1967] AC 725. This practice is now

common.

If a total stranger can successfully file an application for writ in

the spirit of public interest, why cannot the petitioner Trade

Union, which represents (as seen from inter alia the relevant

Collective Agreement marked P6) a segment of employees

affected by the decision reflected in P11, which is sought to be

quashed by certiorari, file this writ application?

23

I overrule the preliminary objection regarding standing of the

petitioner to file this application, and hold that a Trade Union on

behalf its members can file a writ application.

3.2. CEB is an Independent Entity

The principal preliminary objection taken up by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 1st respondent-CEB is that the CEB

is an independent and autonomous entity created and governed

by the Ceylon Electricity Board Act, No.17 of 1969, as amended,

and therefore the Board of Directors can take decisions as to

remuneration of employees as an independent institution. The

unsustainability of this objection can easily be demonstrated by

the Board Minutes of the fateful day (26.11.2014) marked P5,

which I quoted above. If I may repeat a portion, it reads:

In view of the above the Board decided to accept the

proposed Collective Agreement which includes the above

mentioned salary and bonus increase and recommend to

the Secretary/Ministry of Power and Energy,

Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Planning and the

Cabinet of Ministers for approval.

This has again been emphasized inter alia in the Minutes of the

Board Meeting held on 11.02.2015 marked P17. It reads as

follows:

The Chairman-CEB stated that publicity has been given

that some CEB trade unions have lodged a complaint with

the CID and Bribery Commission highlighting a financial

fraud with regard to the newly introduced E-Scale.

24

The Board emphasized that the required approvals should

be obtained from the Management Services Department and

the Finance Ministry by the CEB in order to regularize the

salary revisions and the proposed E-Scale.

If the Board could decide the remuneration of the employees of

the CEB without any interference and sanction from any

quarter, there is absolutely no necessity to talk about Collective

Agreements and approvals from the Secretary/Ministry of Power

and Energy, Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Planning, and

the Cabinet of Ministers for the salary increase. From the above

it is abundantly clear that the Board cannot, on its own, decide

on remuneration of the employees of the CEB.

The CEB is estopped in law from taking up a different position

now.

The Minister of Power and Energy in paragraph 11 of his

affidavit filed with the statement of objections of the 2nd and 3rd

respondents states:

Answering the averments contained in paragraph 28 of the

petition I admit that the approval of my Ministry, the

Ministry of Finance, and the approval of the Salaries and

Cadre Pay Commission and the Cabinet approval has not

been obtained for this revised salary scale.

Although it is not necessary, let me add the following for

completeness. The CEB is a Government-owned corporation,

which is fully controlled by the Government. It comes under the

Ministry of Power and Energy. The Members to the Board of

25

Directors of the CEB are appointed, in terms of section 3 of the

Ceylon Electricity Board Act, by the Ministers of Power and

Energy, and Finance. It is a waste of time to quote the sections

of the Act extensively to convince that the CEB is not an

independent and autonomous entity where the Board of

Directors has been given a free hand to take any decision

including salary enhancement according to the whims and

fancies of the directors. Let me touch upon a few sections in

passing. Section 9 of the Act says that all officers and servants

of the Board shall be deemed to be public servants within the

meaning the Penal Code. Section 40 says that after the coming

into operation of the Act, there may be granted to the Board,

with the prior approval of the House of Representatives, from the

Consolidated Fund such sum of money and on such terms as

may be determined by the Minister in charge of the subject of

Finance in consultation with the Minister. Sections 41, 42,

43,44 etc. provide for borrowings by the Board with consent and

concurrence of the Finance Minister and the Subject Minister,

which are guaranteed by the Government and charged on and

paid out of the Consolidated Fund. Section 49(2) says that the

accounts of the Board for each financial year shall be audited by

the Auditor-General. Section 57 provides for acquisition of

immovable property under the Land Acquisition Act for the

Board, and section 61 provides for special Grant or Lease of

immovable property to the Board under State Lands Ordinance.

It is absolutely clear that the CEB is not the private property of

its Board of Directors. The money which the CEB needs is

raised not by issuing shares, but by borrowing. Borrowing from

whom? Predominantly from the Treasury. When borrowed from

26

others, the guarantor is the Government. If the CEB cannot

repay, the loss falls on the Consolidated Fund, which means the

tax-payer, i.e. the general public. If the Board mismanages the

affairs of the CEB, thereby inevitably causing huge losses, what

is the end result? The public would be forced to bear the burden

including payment of higher amount for electricity. Then it is

clear that the CEB is discharging functions of public nature.

Their decisions have a direct bearing on the general public.

Hence their decisions shall be subject to judicial review.

Professor WadeAdministrative Law 9th Editionat 145-146

states The actions of public corporations are judicially reviewable

in the same way as those of other bodies, where they have

powers of a public law character.The modern law of judicial

review is, in this regard, guided by function rather than form.

It is common knowledge that the frontiers of certiorari have

extended with the passage of time. It started against inferior

courts, and then extended to statutory bodies, and now covers

non-statutory bodies which discharge duties of public nature.

In Harjani v. Indian Overseas Bank [2005] 1 Sri LR 167 at 172-

173, Marsoof J. stated:

The dynamism of law has driven the traditional remedy of

certiorari away from its familiar moorings by the impetus

of expanding judicial review (H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth,

Administrative Law, 8th Edition, page 627). As Professor

Wade observes, Courts have through their decisions

extended the pale of judicial review to bodies which, by

the traditional test, would not be subject to judicial review

27

and which, in some cases, fall outside the sphere of

government altogether. (ibid.) A variety of commercial,

professional, sporting and other activities are regulated by

powerful bodies which are devoid of statutory status, and

Courts in Sri Lanka and elsewhere have demonstrated a

willingness to recognize the realities of executive power

and to review the decisions of a number of such bodies. In

their desire to prevent the abuse of executive power in the

hands of these powerful non-statutory bodies, the courts

have ventured to review the decisions of these bodies. The

limits of this new jurisdiction have been explored in a series

decisions such as R v. Criminal Injuries Compensation

Board, ex parte Schofield [1971] 1 WLR 926, ex parte Tong

[1976] 1 WLR 1239, ex parte Cummins [1992] 4 Admin. LR

747, R v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board ex parte P

[1995] 1 WLR 845. As Lord Parker, C.J. observed in R v.

Criminal Injuries Compensation Board ex parte Lain [1967]

2 All ER 770 at 778:

The exact limits of the ancient remedy by way of certiorari

have never been and ought not to be specifically defined.

They have varied from time to time, being extended to meet

varying conditions. At one time the writ only went to an

inferior Court. Later its ambit was extended to statutory

tribunals determining a lis inter partes. Later, again it

extended to cases where there was not lis in the strict

sense of the word, but where immediate or subsequent

rights of citizens were affected.

28

It is noteworthy that the decision in R v. Panel on Takeovers

and Mergers ex parte Datain [1987] 1 QB 815 extended the

application of prerogative remedies to the London Takeover

Panel, which is a non-statutory body regulating the conduct

of takeovers and mergers in the London Stock Exchange on

a voluntary basis through a process of self regulation. In R

v. International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and

the Republic of Ireland Limited [1993] 1 All ER 422, the

English Courts have held that the London Stock Exchange,

which has been constituted as a limited liability company,

is subject to judicial review. In decisions such as the

Governor and Company of the Bank of Scotland, Petitioners

[1989] BCLC 700, R v. FIMBRA, ex parte Cochrane [1991]

BCLC 106, SIB Anor v. FIMBRA & Anor [1992] Chancery

268 and R v. LAUTRO, ex parte Ross [1992] 1 All ER 422

the Courts have held that although judicial review is not

available in the context of purely contractual powers, the

authority of a contractual nature which various self-

regulating organizations have over their members help

these organizations to perform their public functions, and

accordingly the failure of such an organization to perform a

contractual obligation may be subjected to judicial review.

The rationale for making such non-statutory bodies

amenable to prerogative remedies appears to be that they

are discharging functions of a public nature.

I hold that the decision contained in circular P11 is amenable to

judicial review. I overrule that objection.

29

3.3. Futility

The learned Presidents Counsel for the CEB took up another

preliminary objection on futility. This was based on the

developments said to have taken place subsequent to the filing

of this application. The Court allowed the learned Presidents

Counsel for the CEB to tender the documents in that regard by

way of a motion with copies to the Attorneys-at-Law of the

opposite parties with the sole object of seeing whether

settlement is possible, and, simultaneously, fixed the matter for

the Judgment allowing the parties to file written submissions in

between. Before filing writing submissions, the learned counsel

for the petitioner informed Court that the petitioners grievance

has not been addressed by the alleged subsequent developments

and therefore there was no compromise.

The CEB cannot now seek dismissal of the petitioners

application in limine stating that status quo has changed

subsequent to the filing of the application.

It is well settled law that rights of the parties shall be

determined at the time of the institution of the action. (Talagune

v. De Livera [1997] 1 Sri LR 253 at 255, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd

v. Minister of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235

at 248, Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank [1998] 3 Sri LR 197 at

198)

In the application for writ of mandamus, in Abayadeera v. Dr.

Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo

[1983] 2 Sri LR 267 at 280, it was held that:

30

The petition in this case was filed on 30.6.83. The

Emergency (Universities) Regulations No. 1 of 1983, cited

by learned counsel for the petitioners, and on which he

founded an argument, were made on 21.7.83. In our view

these regulations have no application, for, rights of parties

are their rights at the date the petitioners application was

made (Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268,

272, Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499, 500) and must be

decided according to the law as it existed when the

application was made (10 NLR 44 at 51); Ponnamma v.

Arumugam 8 NLR 223, 226.

In Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour & Vocational

Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248, the petitioners sought to

quash the arbitral award by certiorari and prohibition.

Dismissing that application, Jayasuriya J. inter alia stated:

It is trite law that a court or tribunal must determine and

ascertain the rights of parties as at the date of the

institution of the action or as at the date of the making of

the reference for arbitration. Commencement of the action is

the time at which the rights of the parties are to be

ascertained. Vide Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499 (PC),

Mohamed v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268, Bartleet v. Marikkar

40 NLR 350. The claim and demand on behalf of the

workers who were members of the fourth respondent trade

union had been made on 12th of March, 1988. The

reference by the Minister of Labour for settlement by

arbitration had been made on the 24th of November, 1989

and the statement of the matter in dispute has been framed

31

by the Commissioner of Labour and specified on the 24th of

November, 1989. In the circumstances, the arbitrator had

jurisdiction, authority and right to decree the grant of a

salary increase of Rs. 250 with effect from 24.11.89.

The petitioner does not admit, nor was the Court convinced,

what was improperly and forcibly done by P11, was undone

subsequent to filing of this application.

It appears that what has been done is in order to keep the said

arbitrary salary increase for Engineers intact, some attempts

have been made to increase the salaries of the other employees.

Is that the solution to the problem? Who will ultimately bear the

burden?

Even if it were undone, this Court does not act in vain by

formally quashing that decision by certiorari to impress upon

the other bodies who discharge functions of public nature that

the same fate will befall on them if they also behave in the

manner the CEB did in this instance.

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 the petitioner-

appellant applied for certiorari and mandamus against the

refusal to issue a liquor license for 1987. When it came before

the Supreme Court the matter was only academic as the year

1987 had lapsed. Nonetheless, whilst allowing the appeal,

Amarasinghe J. took the view that The court will not be acting in

vain in quashing the determination not to issue the licence for

1987 because the right of the petitioner to be fully and fairly

heard in future applications is being recognised.

32

In Nimalasiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela [2003] 3 Sri LR 85,

Sripavan J. (later C.J.) stated:

Learned State Counsel urged that it is a futile exercise to

issue a writ of certiorari because the decision complained of

related to the year 2002 which had already expired.

However, following the decision in Sudakaran v. Barathi

and others [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 this Court issues a writ of

certiorari quashing the decision of the second respondent

contained in the letter dated 27.08.2002 marked (P4). Thus

this Court is not acting in vain because the right of the

petitioner to be fully and fairly heard in future application is

recognized.

I overrule the objection on futility.

3.4. Administrative Inconvenience

The learned Presidents Counsel for the CEB also states that, if

this Court is to quash P11 at this juncture, there will be serious

consequences. I do not anticipate such dire consequences.

In any event, if the decision is patently illegal, the decision is a

nullity. It is null and void ab initio. There is no legal

requirement to quash a decision which is null and void ab initio

although Courts formally do so out of abundance of caution to

manifest the intention of the Court in unambiguous terms.

When the decision is ex facie illegal, Court cannot turn a blind

eye on the basis that, making it right, would cause grave

inconvenience to the ones who are already beneficiaries of that

illegal decision.

33

In Pathirana v. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police) [2006]

2 Sri LR 281 at 291, Sriskandarajah J. quashed the impugned

circular by way of certiorari overruling a similar objection taken

up by the State:

The learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents

objected to the relief claimed by the Petitioner on an

additional ground urged at the time of argument namely;

that the impugned circular was in operation from 2001

January and if it is quashed by this court now it will cause

administrative inconvenience. In view of this submission

this court requested the Counsel for the Respondent to

produce the list of officers who were benefited by the

impugned circular. Document X, Y and Z were produced by

the respondents giving the list of officers. A perusal of this

list shows that twelve officers were reinstated after the

circular came into effect and one of them were reinstated

after this action was instituted. In Consumers Association

of Lanka v. Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of

Sri Lanka and three Others [2006] 1 Sri LR 174 this Court

held, citing the Judgment of Congreve v. Home Office (1976)

QB 623 that when an order is ultra vires, the order was

acted upon and the quashing of that order would cause

administrative inconvenience cannot be a criterion to refuse

a writ of certiorari.

I reject that objection.

4. Conclusion

The preliminary objections taken up against the maintainability

of the application are not entitled to succeed.

The decision contained in P11 is badincurably bad. Illegalex

facie illegal. Null and voidnull and void ab initio. I quash P11

by certiorari, which I do unhesitatingly.

The 1st respondent CEB shall pay the petitioner a sum of Rs.

200,000/= as costs of the application.

Application allowed.
