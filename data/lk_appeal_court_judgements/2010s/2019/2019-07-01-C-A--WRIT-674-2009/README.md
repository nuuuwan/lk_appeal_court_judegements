A.H.M.D. Nawaz.J.,

No Counsel appears for the petitioner. This was a matter that was argued before Her

Ladyship Justice Rohini l\1arasinghe on 1711 0/20 11 and Her Ladyship Justice Rohini

Marasinghe had fixed thi, matter for Written Submissions to be filed on 15111/2011.

The Written Submissim s were tendered only on 27/01/2012 and thereafter Her

Ladyship had fixed this matter for judgment to be delivered on 27/04/2012. When this

matter come up on 270412012, the delivery of the judgment was re-fixed for

14/05/2012. On 14/05/2012 the Petitioner was absent and unrepresented but he

appeared and the Court made order to have this matter mentioned on 30.05,2012 for

judgment. On 30.05.2012 the judgment was re-fixed for 28/1112012.

On 28/1112012 after having perused the petition, the objections and the Written

Submissions, the Court had taken the view that this matter could be settled between the

Public Authority and the Petitioner. The Court had given time till 11.01.2013 for terms

of settlement to be intimated to the parties. 11/01/2013. Thereafter this case had never

come up in Courts. It had not been listed at all until by a motion dated 13/1112017 filed

1 , by the Attorney at Law for the 1 st - 3rd respondents the 1 st - 3rd respondents moved that

this matter be mentioned on one of the three dates given in that motion. This matter was

mentioned before A.H.M.D Nawaz, J and E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J on 30/1112017 and

since the Petitioner was absent and unrepresented. he was noticed to appear in court and

a notice was dispatched to 'the Attorney at Law for the i1etitioner to be present in Court

on 1110112018. When this matter came up on 1110112018, S.N. Vijith Singh the

Attorney at Law for the Petitioner informed Court that he had no instructions from his

client. In interest of justice the Court wanted to go through the pleadings that were filed

in this case and make an appropriate order. This order was undertaken to be made by

me and after having gone through pleadings I observe that the petitioner sought a writ

of certiorari and prohibition challenging his expulsion Hom his party and his subsequent

vacation of membership from Manmunai South Eruvill Pattu Pradeshiya Sabha. This

application had been filed on 08/10/2009 in this court seeking inter alia:

A) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions contained in the letter dated ,

30.07.2009.

B) A Writ of Prohibition preventing 1 st /2nd Respondents from publishing a Gazette

notification under Section lOA (1), (2) and (3) of the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance;

C) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the Gazette notification under Section lOA (1), (2)

and (3) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance if it has been published.

Section lOA of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended reads as follows:

"( 1) If the elections officer of the district in which a local authority area is situated, is

satisfied that any person whose name has been included as a candidate for election as a

member of that local authority, in the nomination paper of a recognized political party,

has ceased to be a member of that party, the elections officer shall, subject to the

provisions of subsection (2), by notice published in the Gazette declare that such person-

(a) Has vacated his office of member, ifhe had been elected as a member of that

local authority; or

(b) Has forfeited his rights to have his name retained in the nomination paper of

that recognized political party for filling any casual vacancy, and thereupon,

such person shall vacate his office as member of that local authority or the

name of such person shall be expunged from the nomination paper of that

recognized political party, as the case may be, as from the date on which such

< ' declaration is published in the Gazette.

(2) The elections officer shall not publish the notice referred to in subsection (1)

except after-

(a) notice to such person and such recognized political party;

And

(c) Expiry of a period of twenty-one days from the date of such notice. Every

such notice shall be sent by registered post.

(3) Whenever any person whose name has been included in the nomination paper of

a recognized political party ceases to be a member of such party the secretary of

that party shall furnish such information to the elections officer of the district in

which the local authority, to which that nomination paper relates, is situated.

The effect of these provisions is that a person who ceases to be a member of the

recognised political party from which he contested the local authority elections shall

cease to be a member of that local authority ipso jacto, The purpose of giving him 21

days in terms of Section lOA (2) is to allow him to challenge the decision of the

recognised political party to expel him in the appropriate forum.

These provisions have been interpreted both by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme

Court on a number of occasions.

Farook v Siriwardena (Returning Officer) [(1995) 2 Sri.L.R. 124

The Petitioner's name was included in the Nomination paper submitted by the Sri Lanka

Muslim Congress, a recognized political party as a candidate for election as a member

of the Colombo Municipal Council at the local elections held in 1991, in terms of S.

28(2) of the Local Authoni:ies Elections Ordinance. The Petitioner was declared elected

as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council.

Sometime later the General Secretary of the Party the 2nd Respondent informed the

Petitioner with a copy to the Returning Officer - 1 st Respondent, that he has been

expelled from the Party. Upon receipt of this ietter, the 1st Respondent gave the

Petitioner notice by registered letter that in terms of S.l OA (2) of the Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance he would be taking steps after the expiry of 21 days to publish a

Notice in the Gazette dec~aring that he has vacated his office as a Member.

The Petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1 st Respondent.

It was held:

S. 10A(I) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, enacted by Law No 24

of 1977, provides that whenever any person whose name has been included in the

Nomination paper of a recognized Party ceases to be a member of such Party, the

Secretary of the Party should furnish such information to the relevant Elections

Officer.

S. 1 OA(1) states that if he Elections Officer is satisfied that any person whose

name has been included as a candidate for election as a member of that Local

Authority in the Nomination Paper of a recognized Political Party, has ceased to

be a member of that Party, the Elections Officer should, after Notice to such

person and such recognized Political Party and after the expiry of 21 days from

the date of such Notice published in the gazette declare that such person has

vacated his office and forfeited his right to have his name retained in the

Nomination Paper.

(i) There is nothing in the above provisions to indicate that the Elections Officer

should himself take steps to ascertain whether the member has been lawfully

removed from the Party.

(ii) The Elections Officer has a ministerial duty to perform on receipt of the said

information.

(iii) There is no further duty cast on the Elections Officer other than to give Notice

under S. 10A(2) and declare by publishing in the gazette that such person has

vacated his office.

This case was appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld the judgment of the Court

of Appeal. The decision of the Supreme Court went as follows.

Farook v. Siriwarena, Election Officer and Others [1997) 1 Sri.L.R. 145

The appellant was a member of the Colombo Municipal Council. After calling

for his explanation" the recognized Political Party to which he belonged expelled

him from the membership of the Party by writing. A copy of the Communication

addressed to the appellant was sent to the Election Officer who gazetted the

requisite notice of vacancy in the membership of the Council, in terms of the of

Section lOA (1) (a) of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance. Consequently,

the recognized political Party nominated a new member in terms of Section 65A

(2) of the Ordinance.

This Court also draws attention to Azmy and another v Attanayake and 5 Others (2010)

B.L.R 42 wherein it was emphasized that a ministerial function (performance of duty)

is not amenable to writ jurisdiction. What is meant by a "ministerial function" is

described in Jain and Jain in The Principles of Administrative Law (1998) 4th Ed.at page

325 as follows:

. I Functions dischargeable by the administration may either by ministerial or

discretionary. A ministerial function is one where the law prescribes the duty to be

performed by the concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving nothing to

the discretion or Judgment of the authority. It does not involve investigation into

disputed facts or making of choices. The authority concerned acts in Strict Obedience

to the law which imposes on it a simple and definite duty in respect of which it has no

choice.

The thrust of the cases and the principle is that a minbterial function (performance of

duty as prescribed by the law and not a discretionary function) is not amenable to the

~ ~ prerogative writ jurisdiction.

In the circumstances I take the view that there is no merit in this application and in any

event it is common ground that the aforesaid Pradeshiya Sabha has since been dissolved

and a new Pradeshiya Sa~ha has been constituted.

I

In the circumstances it would futile to issue the Writs sought and having regard to the

fact that the Petitioner himself has not exhibited due diligence to prosecute this

application. This court proceeds to dismiss the application.
