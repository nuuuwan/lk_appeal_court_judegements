This is a case where the Plaintiff alleged that soon after he was placed in possession,

consequent to a partition suit, of a portion known as 5B of a larger land called

Dematagahamula Watte, he was dispossessed by the original Defendant ... Leelawathie. So he

instituted this Rei Vindicatio action which restored him back to possession and the appeal

arises out of the judgment delivered in the Rei Vindicatio action. The previous partition

suit bearing No.l645/P wherein both the Plaintiff and the Defendant had been allotted

2 .

. ".

0. their respective lots figures prominently in this appeal along with the final partition plan

bearing No.1333A.

In the schedule to the plaint filed in the Rei Vindicatio action, the original Plaintiff Francis

described Lot 5B to which he wanted restoration as Dematagahamula Watte and the corpus

had in fact been described as such in the final partition decree. When the writ was

executed in consequence of the partition decree and possession of lot 5B in the final

partition plan No.l333A was given to the Plaintiff on the 29th of September 1993, the

Defendant~Leelawathie had objected but after the fiscal explained, she relented.

But the Plaintiff avers in his plaint filed in the Rei Vindicatio action that no sooner had the

fiscal gone away after having placed him in possession on the 29th September 1993 than

the Defendant entered Lot 5B around 6.30 pm on the same day and dispossessed him.

This gave rise to the Rei Vindicatio action.

Prior to the institution of the civil action, the breach of the peace ended up in

Magistrate's Court, Rattotta, wherein parties were directed to seek their civil remedy. It

is in these circumstances that the Plaintiff averred that he instituted this Rei Vindicatio

action and sought a declaration of title to Lot 5B and ejectment of the Defendant, her

servants and all those who claimed rights under her.

In the answer, the Defendant~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Defendant") sought a cross claim that Lot 5B was Dematagahamula Rena and therefore the

plaint must be dismissed. The Defendant also averred in her answer that she had

objected to possession being handed over to the Plaintiff in the presence of the fiscal and

that the Plaintiff, had not had any possession of the land.

The trial in the Rei Vindicatio action

It would appear that the Plaintiff's action had at one stage been dismissed on account of

his default on the 4th of June 1988~vide Journal Entry No.20. The case was however

restored back to trial and the trial began afresh~see page 74 of the appeal brief.

".

Issues No. 1~6 were formulated by the Plaintiff, whilst Issues No. 7 ~ 15 were framed by the

Defendant. On behalf the Plaintiff's case, the substituted Plaintiff, S.A.A. Majid (the

Registrar of the District Court of Matale), S.P.M. Sunitha Menike (a clerk of the Primary

Court) and a licensed surveyor gave evidence, whilst documentary evidence P2~P6 was

also adduced in evidence. On behalf of the Defendant, the Defendant and a Gramaseva

Niladhari of Rattotta,Madurawala testified, marking in evidence documents marked Dl~

D9, excluding the document marked D3.

On the 20th of October 2000, the learned District Judge of Matale pronounced judgment

in favour of the substituted Plaintiff~Respondent and granted the relief prayed for in the

plaint namely a declaration of title and ejectment of the Defendant~Appellant.

The learned District Judge of Matale concluded that the Defendant was estopped from

denying that the corpus in Case No. P/1645 is the land called "Dematagahamulawatte" and

the Defendant cannot challenge the final partition decree in the said case as it was a

decree in rem and also because the Defendant was a party in the said Case No. P/1645. It is

against this judgment that the Defendant~ Appellant has preferred this appeal in order to

have the said judgment set aside.

Some of the salient arguments that were taken on behalf of the substituted Defendant,

Appellant in order to challenge the judgment of the learned District Judge can now be

itemized.

1. Rejection on the part of the learned District Judge of Matale to issue a commission.

2. Refusal to permit calling a witness.

3. Failure to identify the corpus.

I would now focus on these three principal grounds of appeal that were urged before me.

l. Rejection on the part of the learned District Judge of Matale to issue a

commission.

It was submitted on behalf of the substituted Defendant~Appellants that the learned

District Judge erred in law by refusing the Defendant's application for a commission to

survey the subject matter.

4

When the trial began afresh before the District Judge of Matale on the 29th of February

2000, the learned Counsel for the original Defendant moved for a commission to have the

disputed lot (SB) surveyed. This application was objected to by the Counsel for the

Plaintiff and the learned District Judge in his order adverted to the long delay in making

this application and rejected this application on the ground that this application was

never made in the answer nor was it made on any of the subsequent dates until this was

made for the first time when the first trial began on 29th February 2000. I must state that

the learned District Judge was indeed wide off the mark in his decision to refuse the

application.

The learned Counsel for the substituted Defendant~ Appellants Mr. Shantha J ayawardene

quite correctly submitted that as per Section 428 of the Civil Procedure Code, there is no

specific stage for an application for a commission to be made~see CanapathipilJai v.

Adannappa Chetty 21 N.LR 217 wherein the Supreme Court held that a Court has the

jurisdiction to issue a commission even after the conclusion of the trial. So there was no

requirement that an application for a commission must be made at an anterior stage of a

trial as the learned District Judge has concluded in his order.

Be that as it may, the attempt of the original Defendant to prove that the disputed lot is

Dematagahamula Hena cannot succeed as the final decree in the Partition Case No. P/164S

quite clearly shows that it was only Dematagahamula Watta that was partitioned. Even the

final Partition Plan bearing No.1333A makes this crystal clear. The Plaintiff in this Rei

Vindicatio action had been allotted L.ots SA.and SB of the final Partition Plan No.1333A in

the partition suit. The Defendant who had been the 5th Defendant in the Partition suit

was allotted Lot No.6 of Plan No.1333A by the final partition decree.

All these lots were carved out of a land called Dematagahamula Watta. In other words, the

lots allotted to the Plaintiff and the Defendant all came out of Dematagahamula Watta.

Having accepted a Lot in Dematagahamula Watta, it would be preposterous for the

Defendant now to argue that Lot SB is not part of Dematagahamula Watta. He cannot blow

hot and cold and seek to argue that Lot SB is Dematagahamula Hena.

5

",

The Defendant accepted a lot in the very plan, which described the land as

Dematagahamula Watta and not Dematagahamula Hena. Having accepted Lot No.6 in the land

that is described as Dematagahamula Watta, could the Defendant now argue that Lot SB is

Dematagahamula Hena? It would be an abuse of process to ask for a commission to survey

Lot SB.

This case is chock,full of inconsistent and contradictory stances on the part of the

Defendant. The statement of claim filed by the Defendant displays another example of

such an inconsistency per se.

The statement of claim filed by the Defendant in the partition case was marked in

evidence as P4 in the subsequent Rei Vindicatio action which has given rise to this appeal.

In this statement of claim, the Defendant admitted the devolution of tide as set out in the

relevant paragraphs to the plaint and claimed to be entided to an undivided 1/21 share in

the land called Dematagahamula Watta as depicted in preliminary Plan No.l1l3. In her

statement of claim that was filed in the partition suit, the Defendant, Leelawathie did not

claim Lot SB as Dematagahamula Hena. In other words, she was not saying the same thing

in the Partition action as she did in the Rei Vindicatio action.

Therefore, she cannot seek to prove in the Rei Vindicatio action that Lot SB is

Dematagahamula Hena. Even in regard to her statement of claim in the Partition suit vis,a'

vis her subsequent answer in the Rei Vindicatio action, it could be said that she was

blowing hot and cold.

This conduct on the part of the original Defendant harks back to the principle that,

"She/He who alleges contradictory things is not to be believed",Allegans contraria non est

audiendus.

In the circumstances, since the Defendant has accepted this corpus as Dematagahamula

Waua,she is estopped from asserting that it is Dematagahamula Hena. There is also another

factor that would militate against permitting this Defendant to establish the land as

Dematagahamula Hena for the reason that the Defendant never sought to cross,exarnine the

6

Plaintiff in the Partition Case bearing No. P/1645. In other words, though the Plaintiff in

his evidence described the land as Dematagahamula Watta, the Defendant never dared to

challenge the Plaintiff on this position in the partition trial.

Failure to cross .. examine the Plaintiff on a material point

There is thus a failure to cross examine the Plaintiff on a material point and as Peter

Murphy on his Murphy on Evidence (8th Edition, 2003), page 597 .. 598 observes, there are 2

distinct consequences of a failure to cross .. examine a witness. One is purely evidential in

that, "failure to cross .. examine a witness who has given relevant evidence for the other side is held

technically to an acceptance of the witness's evidence .. in .. chief" The other is a technical one, but no

less important for that, ''where a party's case has not been put to witnesses called for the other side,

who might reasonably have been expected to be able to deal with it, that party himself will probably be

asked in cross examination why he is giving evidence about matters which were never put in cross

examination on his behalf"

Both these two direct consequences of failure to cross .. examine a witness on a material

point, as expounded by Professor Peter Murphy, ensue in this case and they cast a pall of

gloom on the testimonial trustworthiness of the original Defendant. Because the

Defendant had not cross .. examined the Plaintiff in the previous partition case on the

assertion of the Plaintiff that the land sought to be partitioned was Dematagahamula Watta,

that failure to cross .. examine entails the consequence that the Defendant has admitted

that Lot 5B is in Dematagahamula Watta.

Since the Defendant had not put to the Plaintiff in the partition suit his position that the

land is Dematagahamula Rena, the 2nd consequence as identified by Professor Peter Murphy

follows namely he is precluded from asserting in the Rei Vindicatio action that the subject ..

matter of contention is Dematagahamula Rena.

The wisdom encapsulated in Professor Peter Murphy's adumbration on failure to cross ..

examine a witness was long recognized by Lord Herschell, LC in the celebrated House

of Lords decision of Browne v. Dunn (1893) 6 R.67 and the requirement to challenge the

7

evidence by putting the contradictory matter to a witness is sometimes called the rule in

Browne v. Dunn.

The essence of the rule in Browne v. Dunn is a general duty on a party to put a matter

directly to a witness if he is going to later adduce evidence to impeach the witness'

credibility or offer contradictory evidence. The purpose of the rule is well~grounded;

witnesses should be given an opportunity to respond to competing versions of claims or

events. If this has not happened, in assessing the weight to be given to the

uncontradicted evidence, judges may properly take into account the fact that the

opposing witness was not questioned about it.

This is exactly what R.N.G. Fernando C.] couched in a different formula in the election

petition case from Balapitiya~ Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de Silva 70 N.LR 169 at p

174.

"If the Petitioner leads evidence and the Respondent does not contradict it, this is an additional

"matter before the Court," which the definition in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the

Court to take into account."

So be it. In the partition suit nary a question was put to the Plaintiff on Dematagahamula

Hena. When the partition decree materialized, it became res judicata against the whole

world signifying the fact that what was partitioned was Dematagahamula Watta and not

Dematagahamula Hena.

It can thus be said that the Defendant, Leelawathie had accepted that Lot SB is a part of

Dematagahamula Watta and she cannot go behind this admission. In the circumstances, the

Defendant~Appellant cannot complain of any prejudice in the refusal of her application

for a commissioned survey. The attempt to show via the new survey that the land is

Dematagahamula Hena is repudiated by her admissions emanating from her failure to cross~

examine the Plaintiff and the doctrine of res judicata in the form of a judgment in rem.

8

:

2. Refusal to permit summoning of witnesses

This is another complaint that was made on behalf the Defendant'Appellant. It was

submitted that the learned District Judge of Matale refused the application of the

Defendant'Appellant to call another witness and as a result the Defendant'Appellant

was compelled to close her case on the 29th of June 2000. When one examines the order

of rejection made by the learned District Judge of Matale on the 29th of June 2000, it is

clear that he has rejected the application to summon another witness on the basis that

the said action had been instituted in 1994 and therefore, there was an urgency to

dispose of this action. In addition, the learned District Judge stated that between the

dates 29th of February 2000, the previous date of proceedings and 29th June 2000, the

date on which the application was made to summon a new witness, there was a period of

4 months which was quite sufficient for the defense to have had that witness ready and

since the witness was not ready to give evidence despite the availability of sufficient

time, the District Judge stated that he was not inclined to allow the application.

It is not clear from the proceedings dated 29th June 2000 that the witness sought to be

called was on the list of witnesses. The Counsel for the Defendant just intimated to

Court that he wished to call another witness and the witness sought to be called was not

indicated with certainty. So this Court cannot ascertain with precision that the refusal of

the learned District Judge pertained to a witness on the list of witnesses.

Even if this witness was not on the list of witnesses, the first proviso to Section 175(1) of

the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) vests the discretion in the Trial Judge to permit

witnesses to be called "i/ special circumstances appear to it to render such a course advisable in the

interest a/justice".

There must be material placed on record for this Court to ascertain the relevance and

admissibility of the evidence sought to be led through the new witness. In other words,

the Counsel must urge "special circumstances" as postulated in the proviso to Section

175(1) of the cpc. Therefore if the witness sought to be called was vital to the case of the

Defendant, there must be material on the record to indicate the nature, content and

9

: . . relevance of the evidence sought to be led. In the absence of such a clarification as to

these requirements in the submissions made by counsel as reflected in the record, this

Court is hard put to assess the strength of the evidence sought to be led. Therefore, there

is no merit in the complaint made by the learned Counsel for the Defendant~ Appellant as

to the prejudice caused to the Defendant in the conduct of his trial.

Further, it was also submitted that when the Defendant gave evidence, a witness named

Samarawikrama Wasala Mudiyanselage Victor Wickremasinghe who gave evidence

after the Defendant had been inside the Court. Upon noticing the presence of this

witness in Court while the Defendant was giving evidence, the learned District Judge

proceeded to record that the said witness had been inside the courthouse while the

Defendant was giving evidence~see page 144 of the appeal brief.

Though the Defendant summoned this witness to the stand, the record shows that the

defence suspended the examination in chief of this witness in midstream. It is thereafter

that the Defendant~ Appellant made the application to call another witness and it is this

application that was rejected. The complaint that the learned District Judge deprived the

defence of leading a new witness seems to be groundless having regard to the facts and

circumstances of the case.

I have already commented on the absence of sufficient material as to the relevance and

admissibility of this witness's evidence. In, any event no new evidence could have

challenged the Partition decree which was a judgment in rem. It is as plain as a pikestaff

that a partition decree binds not only the parties to the case, but also outsiders subject of

course to the challenges given under Section 48 of the Partition Law. If these challenges

are not made, the final partition decree is Res Judicata against the whole world and the

effect of Res Judicata is to shut the jurisdiction of another Court to needlessly to

adjudicate upon the same issues in a subsequent trial.

Improper rejection of testimony ... Section 167 of the Evidence Ordinance

In regard to this ground of appeal I would also draw in aid Section 167 of The Evidence

Ordinance which spells out the following: ...

10

. .

"The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or

reversal of any decisions in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is

raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to

justify the decision, or that if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied

the decision."

Section 167 is applicable to civil as well as criminal cases. This section deals with two

important aspects of the admission and rejection of evidence in proceedings, namely, (1)

evidence that should not be admitted if it is improperly admitted, and (2) evidence that

is to be admitted is improperly rejected. The object of the section is that the Court of

Appeal, in appeal or in revision, should not disturb a decision of a lower court on the

ground of improper admission or rejection of evidence, if in spite of such evidence, there

is sufficient material in the case to justify the decision. In other words, technical

objections will not be allowed to prevail, where substantial justice appears to have been

done. The appellant in such a case must, therefore, show not only that there has been an

improper admission or rejection of evidence, but also that it has been resulted in a

miscarriage of justice~ Mohar Singh v. Ghariba (1870) 6 Beng. L.R. 495 at 499 (P.C).

As I said before, rights of the parties as to their respective Lots in Dematagahamula Watta

had been determined in the Partition suit and notwithstanding the estoppel effect of this

judgment in rem, the Defendant~Appellant was attempting to challenge it by seeking to

call another witness. In my view, this witness could not have advanced the case of the

Defendant and assuming that the rejected evidence ought to have been received, it would

not have varied the decision of the District Court.

Therefore the refusal of the learned District Judge of Matale to deny the right to call a

witness has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

3. Failure to identify the corpus

This argument of the Defendant~ Appellant is also slated to fail as the corpus had been

correctly identified as Dematagahamula Watta and the complaint is that the licensed

surveyor Sugathadasa Ranchagoda who had prepared the final Partition Plan bearing

11

No.1333A had been called to give evidence by the Plaintiff but the Plaintiff stopped

questioning this witness after having posed a few questions. The Counsel for the Plaintiff

informed Court that he did not wish to call this witness to give evidence anymore,see

page 105 of the Appeal brief. The Counsel for the Defendant, Appellant argued that by

giving up the idea to call the said licensed Surveyor as a witness even after bringing him

to the witness box, an inference could be drawn that if the said licensed surveyor had

given evidence, his evidence would have been adverse to the Plaintiff's case. In other

words, the submission of Mr. Shantha Jayawardena, the learned Counsel for the

Defendant,Appellant is that the failure to carry on with the evidence of the said licensed

Surveyor would lead to the presumption being drawn in terms of Section 114(f) of the

Evidence Ordinance.

The illustration (f) to Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance states the follOwing: "that

evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced, be unfavourable to the person who

withholds it."

I am afraid I cannot help but disagree with the submission that an adverse inference

under Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance should be drawn against the Plaintiff.

This witness,the Surveyor who prepared the final plan in the Partition suit was already

there in Court and if he was being sent away by the Plaintiff after having been posed a

few questions, the Defendant could have objected to this course being adopted. He could

have asked Court for an opportunity to cross'examine this witness. When the Defendant

himself had an opportunity of cross,examining this witness and eliciting relevant

evidence, one cannot draw an adverse inference against the Plaintiff by virtue of Section

114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance. There is no withholding of this witness, when it lies in

the power of the Defendant to lead the evidence of the witness. For the presumption

under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance to arise, the evidence must not be

available or is withheld by the opposite party. The presumption will not arise if it is

available within the control of the party who wishes to lead that evidence. In other

words no inference can be drawn where the witness in question is equally available to

both, particularly when he is actually in Court.

12

.. . ~ The Plaintiff in this case is not at par with a party who wrongfully withholds evidence in

his possession. An adverse inference can be drawn only in cases of refusal to bring forth

the best evidence in Court and merely because the Defendant failed to grab the

opportunity to cross~examine a witness brought to the witness box by the Plaintiff, that

omission cannot be palmed off to the Plaintiff. It is equally possible for the Plaintiff to

argue that the Defendant failed to cross~examine this witness because he was not likely

to support the case of the Defendant. It is moot whether in such circumstances an

adverse inference can be drawn against the Defendant because there is a culpable failure

to establish through the surveyor the veracity or otherwise of the story pertaining to

Dematagahamula Rena, be it fanciful or otherwise.

In the circumstances, there is no misdirection on the part of the learned District Judge

and there is no prejudice caused to the Defendant~Appellant who was only trying to take

two bites at the old cherry by posing a challenge to the partition decree that had already

been entered in D.C. Matale Case No. P/1645.

The judgment of the learned District Judge of Matale dated 20th October 2000 has to be

necessarily affirmed and whilst affirming it, I would dismiss the appeal of the Defendant~

Appellant with costs.
