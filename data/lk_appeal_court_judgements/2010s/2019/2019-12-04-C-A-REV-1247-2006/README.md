Decided on: 29.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the five defendants seeking

declarations that (a) she is a co-owner of the land described in

the first schedule to the plaint and (b) she is entitled to a right of

way over the land of the defendants described in the second

schedule to the plant. Pending determination of the action, the

plaintiff also sought an interim injunction preventing the

defendants from obstructing the said right of way.

There is no dispute that, insofar as the application for interim

injunction is concerned, both parties agreed to abide by an order

given by the learned District Judge after an inspection. The

plaintiff and all five defendants also signed the case record

signifying their consent.

Thereafter, the learned District Judge, having visited the place

and making written observations in the presence of the parties

and their respective Attorneys, pronounced the order on

12.06.2006, directing the defendants to allow the plaintiff to use

a right of way of three feet wide along the south-western

boundary of Plan No.3148 prepared by the Court Commissioner

for the purpose of the case.

The 1st-4th defendants have filed this revision application

seeking to set aside that order.

The principal submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the defendants is that such a mandatory order could be made

only after the trial, but not in an interim injunction inquiry.

The learned District Judge, in the observation notes and the

impugned order has stated that the old road used by the

plaintiff has been made practically unusable by the defendants

by making constructions, digging pits etc. It is against that

backdrop the alternative road has been suggested by the learned

District Judge as a temporary measure until the conclusion of

the case.

The learned Presidents Counsel states that when the earlier

land action (20411/L) filed by the plaintiff has been withdrawn,

the application filed under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act has been decided against the plaintiff, the learned

District Judge could not have legally made that impugned order.

He emphasizes that the order has been made not on law but on

equity.

The learned Presidents Counsel further states that what was

granted to the plaintiff is not what was prayed for in the prayer

to the plaint, and the learned District Judge could not have

made that order without the consent of the defendants.

I am not inclined to agree with these submissions.

The Court has power to conduct a local inspection under section

428 of the Civil Procedure Code.

It is well settled law that where parties agree to abide by an

Order or Judgment given by Court after an inspection, all the

defences which have been taken or which could lawfully be

taken recede to the background. Then, the decision of the Court

is based not on strict adherence to the letter of the law, but

upon the observations made by the Judge at the inspection. The

test is subjective, as opposed to objective.

In Walliammai v. Selliah (1970) 73 NLR 509, at the date of the

trial both parties agreed to abide by the decision of Court by the

Judge inspecting the place. When the final order was made after

the inspection, the defendant tried to resile from the agreement

and moved in revision to have the order set aside.

Victor Tennakoon J. with G.P.A. Silva J. agreeing (both of whom

later became Chief Justices) at pages 512-513 held:

Parties to a civil action are free to withdraw defences taken

in their pleadings; and if the parties, fully represented by

counsel, submit to Court that the only outstanding

differences between the parties are such as are capable of

being elucidated and resolved by a local inspection, I can see

nothing in the Code that prevents such a thing being done.

Section 428 of the Civil Procedure Code provides as follows.

In any action or proceeding in which the court deems a local

investigation to be requisite or proper for the purpose of

elucidating any matter in dispute, or of ascertaining the

market value of any property, or the amount of any mesne

profits or damages or annual net profits, and the same

cannot be conveniently conducted by the Judge in person the

court may issue a commission to such person as it thinks fit,

directing him to make such investigation and to report to the

court.

It is thus fully within the powers of a Judge in a civil case to

conduct a local investigation in person for the purpose of

elucidating any matter in dispute or of ascertaining any other

matters referred to in the section. Courts are frequently

called upon to examine exhibits produced in Court and to

form an opinion on disputed questions relating to such

exhibit. But where the real evidence is incapable of being

produced in Court, the Judge can, acting under section 428,

go and see it himself; and it seems to me that the procedure

is the same as if it had been brought into Court and made an

exhibit when it would unquestionably form part of the

evidence. Local inspection by the Judge is of course primarily

intended to enable a Judge to understand or follow the

evidence. But if parties are agreed that the issues between

them can be answered by the Judge on the evidence

afforded by a view of the place, I can see no illegality in the

parties informing the Court that the only evidence in the case

would be that afforded by a local inspection by the Judge.

A useful parallel is to be found in the English rules of Civil

Procedure. Order 35 rule 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court

gives to a Judge by whom any cause or matter is tried power

to inspect any place or thing with respect to which any

question arises in the cause or matter; and similar provision

also exists in the County Court Rules. In Buckingham v.

Daily News Ltd. (1956) 2 QB 534 the Court of Appeal held

that the power to inspect exists not merely to enable the

Judge to follow the case; that an inspection is just as much

Website Copy Website Copy

6

part of the evidence as is the testimony of witnesses; and

that unless the nature of the dispute is such that the

testimony of experts or other witnesses is required the Judge

may form a conclusion based on the inspection alone, or even

in some cases contrary to the evidence of the witnesses. Lord

Denning in a brief judgment agreeing with Birkett and Parker

L.JJ. said-

Every day practice in these courts shows that where the

matter for decision is one of ordinary common sense, the

judge of fact is entitled to form his own judgment on the real

evidence of a view just as much as on the oral evidence of

witnesses

and in refusing to give leave to appeal to the House of Lords

he added-

We do not give leave to appeal to the House of Lords. We

are simply reaffirming the settled practice of the courts for

many years.

I think that Lord Dennings remarks in regard to the position

of a judge of fact acting on the evidence of a view in a civil

case can be applied to a Judge making a local investigation

in Ceylon under section 428 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Accordingly, Tennakoon J. dismissed the revision application in

limine, without even issuing notice on the respondents.

This mode of concluding cases by way of local inspection by the

Judge at the invitation of the parties to the case is not a new

phenomenon. As Seneviratne J. with Tambiah J. agreeing stated

in the year 1982 in Perera v. Belin Menike [1982] 1 Sri LR 206 at

Website Copy Website Copy

211: This practice as is well known still continues. Thus, this

mode of settlement has prevailed for eight decades.

In the said case (Perera v. Belin Menike), as the head note of that

case states:

Plaintiff instituted action for a declaration of a right of

roadway by prescription over two lands owned by the 2nd

defendant. In the alternative Plaintiff claimed a way of

necessity. First Defendant filed answer denying the

plaintiffs right to a roadway. During the course of the trial

the parties agreed to abide by a decision of the Judge after

he made a personal visual inspection of the lands. In

pursuance of this agreement the Judge visited the lands in

the presence of the parties and their lawyers and decided to

award the plaintiff a right of way. The first defendant

respondent filed this action for restitutio in integrum on the

grounds that the agreement was of no force or avail and the

District Judges order should be reversed.

It was held:

[T]he inspection of premises is provided for in Section 428 of

Civil Procedure Code and an agreement to abide by the

decision of the Judge is a valid agreement (following decision

in Walliamme v. Selliah).

In Suriapperuma v. Senanayake [1989] 1 Sri LR 325, Palakidner

J. with the concurrence of P.R.P. Perera J. held:

The Court has full power to conduct a local inspection under

section 428 of the Civil Procedure Code. Where parties agree

to abide by the Courts decision after an inspection, there is

implied in it a waiver of all defences taken in the answer and

a total acceptance of the outcome of the Courts decision after

the agreed inspection.

In this case, there is no complaint by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the defendants that the learned District Judge acted

as an arbitrator and not as a Judge.

From the above dicta of the decided cases, it is clear that the

dismissal of the earlier case of the plaintiff upon withdrawal, the

denial of the plaintiffs relief in section 66 application, and the

failure to stick to the pleadings and legal principles etc. by the

Judge are beside the point when the decision is to be arrived at

after inspection. In such circumstances, the Court can certainly

make an equitable order to meet the ends of justice.

Contrary to the suggestion of the learned Presidents Counsel,

the Court need not get the consent of both parties to make a

valid order at the inspection. If the consent of both parties is

necessary, there is no necessity for the Judge to have an

inspection. The parties can have a joint inspection and tender

the written settlement to Court for the Court to enter decree

accordingly. Consent is only necessary to go for an inspection

and then to abide by the decision given after the inspection.

There is no complaint that such consent was not given by the

defendants.

The learned Presidents Counsel submits the Court has granted

the interim injunction in a manner not pleaded in the plaint. I

am unable to agree. What the plaintiff has sought in the prayer

to the plaint is to grant the right of way over the land of the

defendants, which is described in the second schedule to the

Website Copy Website Copy

plaint. No specific road has been identified in the second

schedule. Therefore, it is not correct to say that what has been

given is not prayed for in the plaint. The road has been given

along the boundary of the defendants land described in the

second schedule to the plaint.

The cases cited above are cases where final Judgments have

been given after inspections.

In the instant case, the impugned order was made after the

agreed inspection in respect of the interim injunction inquiry.

That order is a provisional order valid until the Judgment is

delivered.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

petitioner with costs.
