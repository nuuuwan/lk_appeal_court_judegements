The Petitioner-Appellant appeared in person

Nayomi Wickremasekara, SSC for the Respondents-Respondent s

The Petitioner-Appellant - did not file The Respondents-Respondents - On 30.08.2018

16.10.2019

The Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Southern Province

holden in Tangalle dated 29.04.2013 in Case No. HCRA 03/2012 and seeking to

set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of Walasmulla

dated 02.03 .2012 in Case No. 17601. Both parties agreed to dispose this case by

way of written submissions and to abide by the same.

Facts of the Case:

The accused-persons (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused') were charged in the

Magistrate's Court of Walas mull a for transporting bamboo worth ofRs. 3525/= on

or about 09.05.2011, utilizing a vehicle bearing No. SPGN - 0443 and thereby

committed an offence punishable under the Forest Ordinance. The accused pleaded

guilty to the charge and the Learned Magistrate convicted them and imposed a fine

of Rs. 2500/= on each accused with a default term of 03 months imprisonment.

Page 3 of 8

Thereafter, a vehicle inquiry was held with r~gard to the vehicle bearing number

No. SPGN - 0443 and the petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

'appellant') claimed the vehicle in the said inquiry. At conclusion of the inquiry,

the Learned Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by order dated 02.03.2012.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision application in the

Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden in Tangalle, which was

dismissed by the Leamed High Court Judge on 29.04.2013.

Thereafter, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The appellant has submitted following grounds of appeal, in the petition of appeal;

1. The Leamed High Court Judge has not considered grounds averred in the

appeal

2. The Learned Magistrate has not accepted the evidence of the appellant

even if it was not challenged in the cross-examination

3. The appellant was not given sufficient opportunity to call witnesses in the

vehicle inquiry

4. There had been no fair trial

5. The Learned High Court Judge erred in affirming the order of the

Learned Magistrate even if the appellant had taken precautions to prevent

an offence being committed.

The appellant did not file written submissions even though the opportunity was

given.

Upon reading of the petition, I find that the grounds averred by the appellant in the

petition submitted to the High Court and the petition submitted to this Court are

different. Accordingly, it is observed that the 3'd and 4th grounds of appeal are fresh

Page 4 of8

grounds which were not brought before the J;.,earned High Court Judge. Since an

appellant is not allowed to raise fresh grounds at the appeal stage from a revision

application filed in the High Court, I will not consider the said 3rd and 4th grounds.

The 1 sl and 2nd accused were arrested while transporting pieces of bamboo without

a valid permit. At the vehicle inquiry, the appellant and a representative of the

absolute owner gave evidence. The appellant was the registered owner of the

vehicle. The appellant testified that the vehicle in question was used for the

purpose of transporting goods for his shop. Apart from that, the appellant allowed

the I sl accused to take vehicle for other hires undertaken by him. The appellant

further testified that the vehicle was kept in his residence and the accused-driver

sought his permission prior to taking the vehicle for hire.

The appellant further testified that he did not have knowledge about an offence

being committed and he had advised the accused driver to refrain from using the

vehicle for any illegal purpose.

The Learned SSC for the respondents-respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondents') argued that the evidence of the appellant clearly demonstrated that

he was not vigilant of his property rights.

I observe that the Learned Magistrate had evaluated all the evidence placed before

him. The Learned Magistrate was of the view that even though the appellant and

the absolute owner company testified that they took precautions to prevent an

offence being committed, no evidence was produced in the vehicle inquiry, to

prove the same.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeal l05A12008] , it was held that,

Page 5 of 8

"On a consideration of the ratio dl?cidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to

the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has

to establish the said matter on a balance of probability. " (Emphasis added)

In the case of K.W.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer,

Anuradhapura and another rCA (PHC) 89/2013], it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance,

making use of that vehicle ... Nothing is forthcoming to show that he has

taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being committed by

using this vehicle though he was the person who had the power to exercise

control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore, it is evident that

no meaningful step had been taken either by the owner or his power of

attorney holder, of the vehicle that was confiscated in order to prevent an

offence being committed by making use of this vehicle. "

It is settled law that a vehicle owner in question is required to prove to the

satisfaction of Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent an offence being

committed utilizing his vehicle. Our Courts have held that mere denying of the

Page 6 of 8

knowledge about an offence being committ<;d is not sufficient to discharge the

burden, set out in section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. This view was taken in the

case of W. JaJathge Surasena V. O.I.C, Hikkaduwa and 3 others rCA (PHC)

APN 100/2014], in which it was held that,

" ... A mere denial by the of Registered Owner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge, of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle

laid down in the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of a vehicle

which had been used for a commission of an offe.nce for an unauthorized

" purpose ...

I observe that both, the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge,

were of the same opinion that the appellant had failed to discharge the said burden

cast on him, to the satisfaction of Court.

The Learned High Court Judge had made the following observation,

" ... ccozsi 0@we:l'~~zsilO~~ 58251 .yro15l z\3 ~co025)~Cl ~G@oo@~ .y~5ozsi 8

d3." (Page 45 & 46 of the brief)

Upon perusal of the both orders, I am satisfied that both the Learned Magistrate

and the Learned High Court Judge had made well-reasoned orders, following due

procedure. Therefore, I see no reason, which amounts to exceptional

circumstances, to interfere with the said orders.

Page 7 of 8

Further, as per journal entries, the appellant ,as absent and unrepresented in many

occasions when the case was taken up. The notices were issued on the appellant

and his Registered Attorney on three occasions. The appellant failed to tender

written submissions as well. Therefore, it is apparent that the appellant was not

interested in maintaining this appeal anyway.

Considering above, I affirm both orders of the Learned Magistrate and the Learned

High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is hereby dismissed without costs'.
