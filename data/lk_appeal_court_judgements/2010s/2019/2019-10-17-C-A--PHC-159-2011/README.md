The App I icant -Responden t -Respondent (Respondent), instituted

proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Colombo, in terms of section 28 A (3) of

the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended) (referred to

as the Act), against the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant), regarding an

illegal structure constructed by the Appellant in premises bearing No. 37/8, 2nd

Lane, Rajamahavihara Road, Pitakotte, within the limits of the Sri

Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council. The learned Magistrate by order dated

12/06/2009, directed that the impugned construction be demolished. The

Appellant being aggrieved by the said order preferred a revision application to the

High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo, which was dismissed by

the learned High Court Judge and hence this appeal.

The main issue of contention put forward by this application is whether the

Appellan( is possessed with a valid legal permit to construct a building in the said

premises.

Section 28A (3) (a) of the Act provides that;

"where any person has failed to comply with any requirement contained in any

written notice in pursuance of a notice issued under subsection (1), any building

or work is not demolished or altered within the time specified in the notice or

within such extended time as may have been granted by the Authority, the

Authority may apply to the Magistrate to make a mandatory order authorizing the

Authority to demolish or alter the building or work, and the Magistrate on serving

notice on the person who had failed to comply with the requirement of the

Authority under Subsection (I) to demolish or alter the building or work, may, ifhe

is satisfied to the same effect, make order accordingly. "

In terms of section 23(5) of the Act, the Urban Development Authority

(UDA) acting in terms of subsection (1) of section 28A of the Act issued a written

notice to the Appellant, marked P4, to demolish the unauthorized construction.

The Appellant has not denied receiving the said written notice, and has failed to

respond.

The Appellant has drawn attention of Court to document No. 546, marked

P2, a plan which the Appellant contends has been approved by the UDA.

However, there is no authentication on the face of the document as contended by

the Appellant.

When an application is filed under Section 28A (3) of the Act, the burden

of showing a valid permit to commence, continue resume or complete a

development activity shifts to the party noticed.

This position was clearly illustrated by Gamini Amaratunga J. in the case of

Urban Development Authority vs. H. W. Kulasiri (CA 2226/2003), where it was

held that,

"in a situation where an application made under Section 28(A) (3) of the UDA

Law had been made the relevant question is whether the structure in question has

been erected upon a valid permit. The existence of a permit is the only valid

answer to the application under Section 28(A) (3). The burden of showing that the

construction had been done on a valid permit is on the person noticed. "

The Appellant has constructed an unauthorized structure in premises

bearing No.37/8, 2nd Lane, Rajamahavihare Road, Pita-Kotte, within the municipal

council limits of Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte, in contravention of Section 3 of the

said Act as depicted in plan marked P3. The proceedings contained in the brief

makes it manifestly clear that the Appellant had not obtained a valid permit. It is

an essential requirement that a person obtains a valid permit under the provisions

of the UDA Act before the commencement of any construction. In terms of

Section 23(5) of the Act, the Respondent is statutorily empowered to file an action

against a person responsible for an illegal construction, as defined in the Act.

,

Accordingly, the Respondent duly noticed the Appellant, by document marked P4.

The Appellant neither responded to the notice nor demolished the said

construction. The Appellant has failed to produce any document that proves the

impugned construction was carried out upon a valid permit. In the circumstances,

the application of the Appellant must fail.

Accordingly, T affinn the orders made by the learned High Court Judge and

the Court below.

Petition is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-
