Respondents.

Decided on: 18.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action seeking declaration of title to the

land described in paragraph 2 of the plaint, ejectment of the

defendant therefrom and damages. The defendant filed the

answer seeking dismissal of the action. After trial, the learned

District Judge of Galle dismissed the plaintiffs action. Hence

this appeal by the plaintiff.

The land described in paragraph 2 of the plaint is a land known

as Lot A of Mahagedarawatta in extent 33 perches. Boundaries

to the said Lot have been given in the plaint, but the plaintiff

never produced a Plan to identify the said Lot.

According to the plaint, Arnolis Perera was the original owner of

the land, and upon his death, his rights devolved on his

children, namely Cyril and Violet, and then, Cyril and Violet

gifted it to the plaintiff by Deed P1 dated 20.10.1988. The plaint

is dated 23.03.1990.

In the answer the defendant whilst seeking dismissal of the

action stated that his father was the owner of the said Lot in

extent 33.06 perches by virtue of the Final Partition Decree in

3

Galle District Court partition action No. 17105/P marked V3,

and upon his death, his rights devolved on his children

including the defendant, and thereafter all of them gifted their

rights by Deed V12 dated 14.11.1989 to Godvin Dias

Abeygunawardena, one of the aforementioned children, and

therefore the said Godvin Dias Abeygunawardena is a necessary

party to this action.

Despite this revelation, the plaintiff did not think it fit to make

Godvin Dias Abeygunawardena a party defendant, which, in my

view, goes to the root of the plaintiffs case. At least, by that

time, the plaintiff would have realized that he has filed the

action against a wrong party, or, to say the least, without

making Godvin Dias Abeygunawardena his action is futile.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant during the course

of argument stated that the defendant could have made Godvin

Dias Abeygunawardena a party to the action. There is no such

burden or necessity on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff

shall prove his case.

Although the plaintiff during the course of cross examination

admitted his knowledge about the said partition action and the

fact that the defendants father was allotted Lot A by the Final

Partition Decree1, he never presented his case either in the

plaint or in his evidence in chief in that manner. Further,

although he did not identify the land in suit by way of a Plan,

during the course of cross examination he admitted that the

Final Partition Plan was with him, which was marked by the

1 Vide page 122 of the Appeal Brief.

defendant through the plaintiff as V2.2 The Final Partition

Decree has been marked as V3. This itself shows the mala fides

of the plaintiff and the untrustworthiness of the plaintiff as a

witness.

The plaintiffs position was, as I stated earlier, that Arnolis

Perera, his grandfather, was the original owner of Lot A, and

upon his death, rights devolved on the two children, and then

they gifted it to him by Deed P1. In Deed P1 the donors state

that they acquired title to the land by prescription. As I also

said earlier, the plaintiff filed this action less than 1 years

after the execution of that Deed. Therefore, if he is to succeed in

this action, he should have proved prescriptive title of the

donors. But the plaintiff did not call either of the donors to give

evidence.

A person who claims prescriptive title against the rightful owner

who has the paper title has a very heavy burden to prove all the

requirements prescribed in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Mere possession over ten years is not prescriptive

possession. The possession shall be by title adverse to or

independent of that of the rightful owner. The plaintiff knew the

rightful owner.

The plaintiff does not say from when his predecessors started

prescriptive possession against the defendants father who was

admittedly the owner of the disputed Lot A by a Partition Decree.

This is crucial if the defendant is to succeed on prescription.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the

2 Vide pages 100 and 101 of the Appeal Brief.

5

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests

squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or

her acquisition of prescriptive rights.3 He is not entitled to do so

by forming a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of

ouster.4

In addition to Deed P1, the plaintiff has marked Assessment

Rate Payment Receipts as P2-P14. Some of them are not

relevant to Lot A, the assessment number of which, according to

paragraph 2 of the plaint, is 306/2. In any event, they are not

conclusive evidence to prove possession.5

The Judgment of the District Court is affirmed and the appeal is

dismissed but without costs.
