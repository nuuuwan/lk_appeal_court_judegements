Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

certiorari the decision of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya

Sanwardana Bank marked P14 and the affirmation thereof by

the General Manager marked P15 whereby the petitioner

employee was sent on compulsory leave pending investigation of

alleged acts of grave misconduct. Now she has been reinstated

and disciplinary inquiry has formally commenced by serving the

charge sheet. To that extent, this application has now become

academic. However, the acceptability or non-acceptability of the

argument taken up by the petitioner has a direct bearing on the

maintainability of the disciplinary inquiry. Hence the necessity

to consider the application on merits.

P14 decision has been taken in terms of sections 15, 15.1, 16,

16.4 of the Disciplinary Code marked R2.

It is the contention of the petitioner that the said Disciplinary

Code has no force or avail in law as it has not been published in

the Gazette in terms of section 39 of the Pradeshiya Sanwardena

Bank Act, No.41 of 2008. It is solely on that basis, the petitioner

says that P14 and P15 are null and void.

Section 39 reads as follows:

39(1) The Board may make rules in respect of all or any

matter for which rules are required or authorized to be

made under this Act or any other matter necessary to

enable the Bank to effectively carry out and perform its

powers and duties under this Act.

3

(2) Every rule made by the Board shall be published in the

Gazette and shall come into operation on the date of the

publication or on such later date as may be specified in the

rules.

The contention of the petitioner is that the Disciplinary Code

contains Rules which are necessary to enable the Bank to

effectively carry out and perform its powers and duties under this

Act and therefore publication of the Disciplinary Code/Rules in

the Gazette is necessary to make them enforceable.

I am unable to agree.

Section 1.5 of the Disciplinary Code is the introductory section.

It says that it is issued by the General Manager of the Bank in

terms of section 28 of the Act, and approved by the Board of

Directors in terms of section 9, and all the employees of the

Bank are bound by it.

Section 28 reads thus:

28(1) The General Manager shall issue guidelines in respect

of age of retirement, disciplinary control and any other

matter as may be necessary for the proper administration

of the affairs of the Bank.

(2) The employees of the Bank shall comply with such

directions.

That means, the discipline of the employees is a matter for the

General Manager, who shall issue guidelines in that regard.

When the subject of discipline is provided for by a separate

4

section as such, general provisions shall be understood subject

to the special provisions. That is a basic canon of interpretation

of statutes.

The equalization of the said Guidelines formulated by the

General Manger to Rules which could be made by the Board of

Directors under section 39(1) to enable the Bank to effectively

carry out and perform its powers and duties under the Act is

unacceptable.

Section 39 speaks of Rules made by the Board. P2 Disciplinary

Code was not made by the Board but by the General Manager in

terms of section 28 and approved by the Board of Directors in

terms of section 9.

Under the heading Usage, especially in section 2.2, it says that

the Disciplinary Code is only a set of Guidelines, which shall

never undermine or supersede the authority of the Board, and

the Board at any time can amend it.

If they are Rules as contemplated in section 39, there is no

necessity to say that it shall never undermine the authority of

the Board because Rules contemplated under section 39 are

made by the Board and no other.

The petitioners whole argument depends on the Sinhala word

used in several places in the Disciplinary Code

drafted in Sinhala. The use of the word cannot be

decisive and cannot decide the whole matter.

The sole argument of the petitioner fails.

5

The application of the petitioner which is based on a highly

technical ground is devoid of merits. At least, from the point she

was reinstated, the application became futile. Nonetheless, the

petitioner wanted to proceed with the application.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner with costs.
