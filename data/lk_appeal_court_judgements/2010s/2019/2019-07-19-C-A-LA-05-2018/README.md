Farook Miskin with M.W. Selvarani and Shirin Miskin for the Respondent' Petitioner' Petitioner

M.S.M. Faris with S.Z. Nazeer for the Applicant' Respondent' Respondent

27.02.2019

By way of this application, the Respondent,Petitioner,Petitioner (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as "the Petitioner") seeks Leave to Appeal from the decision

of the Board of ~uazis dated 28.07.2018 wherein the Board of ~uazis had issued a notice on

the Applicant' Respondent' Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Respondent") returnable for 15.09.2018. The order of the Board of ~uazis dated 28.07.2018

has been appended to this application for Leave to Appeal as 'P8'. The decision of the

Board of ~uazis merely states the following:,

2

"Mr. Farouk Miskin AAL appears for the Respondent~Petitioner.

Counsel for the Respondent~ Petitioner was heard in support.

Issue notice on Applicant~ Respondent.

Notice returnable on 15.09.2018."

It is against the above order that the Respondent~ Petitioner~ Petitioner seeks Leave to

Appeal in terms of Section 62(1) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951 as

amended read with Rule 4 of the 5th Schedule of the said Act. Upon this matter being

supported in this Court on 03.09.2018, this Court issued notice of this application on the

Respondent and an interim order staying the operation of the order made by Board of

~uazjs was also issued.

Subsequendy, this matter was argued before this Court for Leave to be granted and I find

that the grounds that have been urged in the application for Leave to Appeal have not

been fully argued before the Board of ~uazis. The Board of ~uazjs has only issued notice on

the Respondent and they are yet to hear the merit of the Appeal that has been preferred

to them against the order of the learned ~uazj of Colombo North. In other words, such

grounds as the absence of the signature of the Respondent in the application she made to

the ~uazi and the legality or otherwise of the ex~parte order made by the ~uazj are yet to

be tested in the Board of ~uazjs.

When the first tier Appellate forum has not yet exercised its jurisdiction, it is an abuse of

process to vex this Court with the same grounds of Appeal on which hearing is yet to

take place in the Board of ~uazis.

Section 62(1) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951 as amended makes it

quite clear that only an order made by the Board of ~uazjs under Section 60 becomes

appealable with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained. If the Board of

~uazjs exercises revisionary jurisdiction under Section 44 of the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951 as amended and makes an order, that order too shall have the

same effect as an order made on appeal. In other words, whether it is an order of the

Board of ~uazjs made in its appellate jurisdiction under Section 60 or it is an order made

3

I

in the revisionary jurisdiction of the Board of ~uazis under Section 44 of the Muslim

Marriage and Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951 as amended, either order is appealable to this

Court with the leave of this Court first had and obtained.

The precondition to the exercise of the Appellate jurisdiction of this Court with the leave

first being granted is that there must be an adjudication on an issue by the Board of

~uazis and the Petitioner before this Court must be aggrieved by the order of the Board of

~uazis. The only order that the Board of ~uazis has so far made is the issuance of a notice

on the Respondent after having heard the Petitioner.

This order cannot give rise to an application for Leave to Appeal as this order confirms

that the Board of ~uazis is satisfied with the prima facie case made out by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner cannot be aggrieved by the issuance of his notice by the Board of ~uazis, as

it is an order in his favor. By issuing notice, the Board of ~uazis has opened the gateway to

the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction under Section 44 of the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act No.l3 of 1951.

The further exercise of the revisionary jUrisdiction of the Board of ~uazis cannot be

frustrated by this application, which is premature, futile and vexatious.

The order dated 28.07.2018 does not contain any other order, which is unfavorable to the

Petitioner. The Board of ~uazis should be free to continue to exercise their jurisdiction

untrammelled by an application of this nature, which invites this Court to exercise a

jurisdiction which it does not have at this stage of this litigation.

In the circumstances, I proceed to affirm the order made by the Board of ~uazis dated

20.07.2018 and direct them to conclude this matter as expeditiously as expeditious could

be.

Therefore, the application for Leave to Appeal is refused.
