The plaintiff father instituted these proceedings against the

defendant daughter in the District Court of Monaragala seeking

to eject her from the premises in suit and for damages. On the

summons returnable day, the defendant came to Court, and the

proxy was filed. The Court granted a date, 26.05.1993, for the

answer. On 26.05.1993 also the defendant came to Court, and

the registered Attorney for the defendant moved for another date

to file the answer. This was vehemently objected to by the

counsel for the plaintiff who appeared on the instructions of the

registered Attorney of the plaintiff who was the Acting District

Judge on that day.

As seen from the proceedings on 26.05.1993, the objection was

purely technical, which is, according to section 80 of the Civil

Procedure Code after the amendment by Act No. 79 of 1988, the

Court had no jurisdiction or discretion to grant a further date to

file the answer, and if the answer is not filed on the first date

fixed for the filing of the same, the Court shall mandatorily fix

the case for ex parte trial against the defendant.

The instructing Attorney for the defendant had disagreed with

that interpretation given to section 80 and stated that the

discretion given to the District Judge to grant extension of time

to file the answer had not been taken away by the said

Amendment. Although that was the first date and not the final

date for the answer, the instructing Attorney has given two

reasons for the failure to file the answer on that date. One is the

fact that he contested as a candidate at the recently concluded

Provincial Council elections thereby not being able to take

proper instructions from the client; and the other is closing

3

down the Land Registry for the election thereby not being able to

obtain copies of Deeds relevant to this land in order to prepare

the answer.

As seen from the proceedings, the counsel for the plaintiff has

not denied or objected to those two reasons as false, but

reiterated that the Court has no discretion to grant a further

date for the answer after the aforementioned Amendment to the

Civil Procedure Code.

This objection raised by the counsel for the plaintiff has been

upheld by the District Judge by order dated 28.06.1993 and

fixed the case for ex parte trial against the defendant.

In that order the District Judge has further stated that, there

was however no prohibition in granting a date provided the

plaintiff did not object to it. The reasoning of the District Judge,

on the one hand, there is no discretion to grant a date, and on

the other hand, a date can be granted if there is no objection by

the plaintiff, is contradictory.

Thereafter, on a subsequent date, scanty evidence of the plaintiff

had been led and ex parte judgment had been delivered.

Thereupon the defendant has made an application under section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code to vacate the ex parte

judgment, and at the inquiry the registered Attorney for the

defendant has given evidence to reiterate what he told in Court

when he asked for another date to file the answer. This

application has also been refused by the District Judge by order

dated 07.02.1996 stating inter alia that the failure to file the

answer is attributable to the negligence of the registered

4

Attorney of the defendant. It is against this last order, the

defendant has preferred this appeal.

First, I must make this point clear. A judge makes several

incidental orders in the course of proceedings before the delivery

of the final Judgment. It is sometimes practically impossible to

file leave to appeal applications against each and every order. It

is better, if the incidental order goes to the root of the case to file

a leave to appeal application as that will decide the whole matter

at once without further ado. The classic example is the

incidental order made by the District Judge in this case dated

28.06.1993 whereby the case was fixed for ex parte trial on the

basis that the Court has no jurisdiction or discretion to grant

another date to file the answer. But that does not mean that the

party affected cannot canvass the said incidental order in the

final appeal.

In Mudiyanse v. Punchi Banda Ranaweera1 it was held by

majority decision of the Supreme Court that:

A party aggrieved by an order made in the course of the

action, though such order goes to the root of the case, has

two courses of action open to him, namely (a) to file an

interlocutory appeal or (b) to stay his hand and file his

appeal at the end of the case even on the very same ground

only on which he could have filed his interlocutory appeal.

If he adopts the latter course, he cannot be shut out on the

ground that his appeal being against the incidental order is

out of time.

The said statement of law has been expressed in several other

cases including Abubakker Lebbe v. Ismail Lebbe2, Perera v.

Battaglia3, Cornel & Company Ltd v. Mitsui and Company Ltd4,

Dominic v. Jeevan Kumaratunga5.

This appeal depends on the interpretation given to section 80 of

the Civil Procedure Code after the amendment by Act No. 79 of

1988 (which has now been repealed and replaced by a new

section by Act No. 8 of 2017). Section 80 as it stood at that time

reads as follows:

On the date fixed for the filing of the answer of the

defendant or where replication is permitted, on the date

fixed for the filing of such replication, and whether the same

is filed or not, the court shall appoint a date for the trial of

the action, and shall give notice thereof, in writing by

registered post to all parties who have furnished a

registered address and tendered the cost of service of such

notice, as provided by subsection (2) of section 55.

It is interesting to note that, section 80 only states that on the

date fixed for filing of the answer of the defendant, whether the

same is filed or not, the court shall appoint a date for the trial of

the action. It is noteworthy that, it does not state on the date

first fixed for filing of the answer.

This difference can be appreciated by making a comparison of

section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code with section 93 of the

Civil Procedure Code (after the amendment of Act No. 9 of 1991)

2 (1908) 11 NLR 309 3 (1956) 58 NLR 447 4 [2000] 1 Sri LR 57 5 [2011] 2 BLR 503 at 509

where in the section 93 which deals with the subject of

amendment of pleadings the words on or after the day first

fixed for trial has been used instead of on or after the day fixed

for trial. Even by amendment Act No. 9 of 1991, section 80 had

not been amended by interpolating the word first before the

word fixed to give the meaning to section 80, which the District

Judge wanted to give.

Further, when section 80 was so amended by Act No. 79 of

1988, section 84 stood as follows:

If the defendant fails to file his answer on or before the day

fixed for the filing of the answer, or on or before the day

fixed for the subsequent filing of the answer or having filed

his answer, if he fails to appear on the day fixed for the

hearing of the action, and if the court is satisfied that the

defendant has been duly served with summons, or has

received due notice of the day fixed for the sub-sequent

filing of the answer, or of the day fixed for the hearing of

the action, as the case may be, and if, on the occasion of

such default of the defendant, the plaintiff appears, then

the court shall proceed to hear the case ex parte forthwith,

or on such other day as the court may fix.

If the intention of the legislature when amending section 80 by

Act No. 79 of 1988 was to remove the discretion of Court to

grant any more dates other than the first date given to file the

answer, the legislature would not have left section 84 in that

manner as section 84 speaks of the day fixed for the filing of the

answer and the day fixed for the subsequent filing of the

answer.

Then it is abundantly clear that the interpretation given to

section 80 by the District Judge is erroneous. I must emphasize

that the District Judge fixed the case for ex parte trial only on

that ground and not on any other ground. If not for that

misinterpretation of the section, I have no doubt that the

District Judge would have given another date to file the answer

following the normal practice of the Court.

The District Judge who wrote the last order refusing to vacate

the ex parte Judgement has stated that, when perusing the

proceedings, it is seen that the registered Attorney has not

stated any reason when he moved for another date to file the

answer, which is totally wrong. I have already adverted to the

two reasons given by the registered Attorney for the failure to file

the answer on the first date given for that purpose. It seems

that the District Judge has not seen those proceedings.

I set aside the impugned order of the District Judge and allow

the appeal with costs.

After the objection was taken for granting a date to tender the

answer, but before making an order on that objection, the

defendant has filed the answer dated 23.06.1993, which has not

been accepted by Court. Let the District Judge now give a date

to file a fresh answer, in which the defendant can take up any

defence including that of res judicata, which the defendant

wanted to make submissions on, before this Court.
