'The issue that arises in this appeal is whether there is evidence of acceptance of a

1 deed of gift executed as far back as the 19th century and subsequent possession on

the part of the donee. This became the bone of contention because it is through the deed

of gift that the Plaintiff-Respondent in this partition action derived title and the

Appellants in the case contend that their devolution prevails over as a result of the

invalidity of the deed of gift. Admittedly Muslim Law applies in regard to the deed of gift

and this issue raised for the first time in appeal remains to be disposed of by reference to

Muslim law.

2

Let me first deal with the facts in the case which pertain to the land located in Gintota,

Galle. The facts are so intricate that they have to be understood having regard to the

pleadings and pedigrees that the parties filed. Though the facts assume importance and I

would set them down, the appeal was argued by Mr. Sandamal Rajapakse the learned

Counsel for the 6th and 7'h Defendant-Appellants on the Single point-Is the Muslim

dowry deed which was known as Kaduttham in olden times and which was produced in

the case, valid in Muslim Law?

Factual Matrix

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

this action to partition a land called "Lot A ofSellamarrikkar Thottam" which is in extent of 1

Rood and 30 Perches. The Plaintiff pleaded the following pedigree-one half share of the

land was owned at one time by 3 persons namely Alia Marrikkar Mohamed Thahir, Alia

Marrikkar Mohamed and Alia Marrikkar Ayesha Umma. These 3 persons transferred the

one half share of the land to 2 persons namely, Abdul Rahuman Mohamed and Abdul

Rahuman Ahamed. Abdul Rahuman Ahamed transferred his 1/4th share to Abdul

Rahuman Mohamed. Thus, Abdul Rahuman Mohamed became the owner of one half

share of the land to be partitioned. Later by a deed of gift, Abdul Rahuman Mohamed

gifted the same to his daughter who was the Plaintiff in this case namely Mohamed

Kadija Beebi.

A commission was issued to one Dayananda Weerasekara Licensed Surveyor who

depicted the said land in Plan No.2906 dated 27'h, 28th and 30th of October 1990. The

corpus was depicted as AI, A2, A3 and A4 in Plan No.2906.

The 3rd, 4th and 8 Defendants filed a joint statement of claim and pleaded the following:-

They admitted the fact that the land depicted as AI, A2, A3 and A4 in Plan No.2906 is

the land to be partitioned in the action. They also stated that at one time, one half share

of the land was owned by Pathumma Nachchiya (one of the children of the original

owner) and out of this ~ share, 1/4th share was transferred by Pathumma Nachchiya to

Mohamadu by Deed No.4120 dated 18.05.1945 and consequently the yd and 4th

3

Defendant-Respondents became the owners of that l/4th share jOintly. Then with respect

to the other 1/4th share, Pathumma Nachchiya transferred the same to Abdul Kafoor

Pathumma Hanoon by Deed No.4100 dated 25.04.1945. Consequently, 1/3 shares of the Y<I

share was owned by the 1st Defendant and 2/3 shares of 1/4th share was owned by the 8th

Defendant.

These Defendants also contended that the 1st Defendant transferred his share to the 8th

Defendant and thereby the 8th Defendant became the owner of V<! share of the land. Thus

eventually the 3rd, 4th, and 8th Defendants claimed one-half share of Abdul Rahuman

Pathumma Nachchiya. In other words the 3rd and 4th Defendants got l/4th of one-half

share of Rahuman Pathumma Nachchiya, whilst the 8th Defendant became entitled to the

remaining 1/4th of Rahuman Pathumma Nachchiya.

The 6th and 7"h Defendant-Appellants also filed a statement of claim and their pedigree

began with the original owner of the land called Asana Marrikkar Abdul Rahuman. He

had 4 children according to the pedigree namely, i) Abdul Azeez ii) Ahamed iii)

Pathuma Nachchiya iv) Kadija Umma. Upon the death of the original owner Asana

Marrikkar Abdul Rahuman, the devolution of the rights of Asana Marrikkar Abdul

Rahuman would be governed by the law of intestate succession under Muslim law and

the parties agreed that Muslim law would be the governing law for this partition action.

Accordingly the 2 sons obtained 2/6 shares each and the daughters inherited 1/6 shares

each.

According to the 6th and 7"h Defendants, after the death of the original owner Asana

Marrikkar Abdul Rahuman, his 4 children became the owners of the entire land to be

partitioned in the action. However, according to their statement of claim, Abdul Azeez

died issueless and left no heirs. Therefore, his 2/6 share devolved on the other 3 remaining

siblings. As per the said statement of claim of the 6th and 7"h Defendants, after Ahamed's

death (the 2nd son of the original owner) his wife and his four children obtained rights to

2/6 shares.

4

The two children of Ahamed from among his 4 children are Zackeriya the 6th Defendant

and Mathloob the 7'h Defendant who are the appellants in the case. However by a Deed

of Transfer 4105 dated 31.08.1964, all the heirs of Rukiya Beebi (one of the deceased

sisters of the 6th and 7'h Defendants) and the mother of the 6th and 7'h Defendants, the 7'h

Defendant himself and one of the sisters of the 6th and 7'h Defendants, transferred all their

rights to the 6th Defendant. By a Deed of Transfer NO.2431 dated 10.04.1990, the 6th

Defendant transferred all his rights to the 7'h Defendant and the 7'h Defendant became

entitled to the said share. Apart from the ownership from their ritle deeds, these

Defendants also claimed prescriptive rights to the entire land.

In the midst of all this intricate and labyrinthine devolutions that could only be

understood with reference to the pleadings and the pedigrees filed in the case, the appeal

though revolves around a dowry deed marked as P4 that raises the question I set out at

the beginning of this judgment. Was there acceptance of the Kadutham by the donee?

Abdul Azees-a son of the original owner Abdul Rahuman, by way of a dowry deed

known in times of yore as Kadutham bearing No.24 and dated 22.06.1894 donated

among many other heirlooms to his beloved sister Kadeeja Umma an undivided 2/6th

share of the land called Sellamarikkar Thottam, situated in Welipity, Modara. It is this

deed of gift that was challenged in this Court as a conveyance that did not transfer the

said 2/6 share because the donee Kadeeja Umma had not, to all intents and purposes,

signed this deed to signify her acceptance. If this is true, the Plaintiff, the yd, 4th and 8th

Defendants would not derive their interests. If the Kadutham is invalid for want of

acceptance by Kadeeja Umma, then the 6th and 7'h Defendant-Appellants are bound to

succeed to their shares.

The learned Additional District Judge of Galle accepted the validity of the Kadutham and

pronounced his judgment dated 03.11.2011 in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent, 3rd, 4th

and 8A Defendant-Respondents.

5

In their statement of claim, the 6th and "(th Defendants claimed the interest of Abdul

Azeez but it was the contention of the Plaintiff that Abdul Azeez's interest had long

been transferred to Kadeeja Umma through the dowry deed known as Kadutham.

Dr CG. Weeramantry (later Judge and Vice President of the International Court of

Justice) in his magnum opus The Law of Contracts Vol-1 page 170 alludes to a Kadutham

thus:-

"A kadutham (a Muslim dowry deed) reciting a gift of property, although a non-

notarial document and therefore inadmissible as a document of title, may be

received in evidence to prove an overt act and a change in the character of

possession on which to base a title by prescription-Nachchia v. Nachchia (1909) 1

Cur.L.R 77; Ibrahim v. Rahiman (1906) 1 Matara 175; Umma v. Abdulla (1912) 2

Matara 114.

The use of Kadutham was quite widespread and unique to the nuptial settlement of

Muslim marriages in days gone by particularly duting the 1880s. It has since fallen into

desuetude and its treatment in most of the textbooks is sparse. Its legal validity as a non-

notarial document was reiterated in the aforesaid cases and Dr. M.S. Jaldeen in his well

known work The Muslim Law of Succession & Waqf Law in Sri Lanka makes reference to the

simple requirements of Muslim law, if a gift were to be made:-

"In Muslim law a gift could be made orally as well as in writing. No attestation is necessary. The

requirement of registration has not been the practice. The more important aspect of donation in

Muslim law is that the gift has to be accepted by the donee. In fact the offer and acceptance

according to Minhaj, should be in explicit terms. If the donor is a parent or guardian and the donee

is a child or ward there need not be ....... Therefore in Muslim law a gift is valid if all three elements

are present, i.e the declaration or tender, acceptance and transfer of possession."

It was during the course of the evidence of the Plaintiff's husband Nasoordeen that the

Kadutham in favour of P4 was led in evidence. This gift of property was from the brother

Abdul Azeez to his sister Kadeeja Umma on the occasion of her marriage on 22.06.1894.

6

By way of this Kadutham, Abdul Azeez gifted an undivided 2/6th share of the land called

Sellamarrikkar Thottam to his sister Kadija Umma.

The learned Counsel for the 6th and 7'h Defendant-Appellants argued that this Kadutham

(P4) is invalid in Muslim Law because the ingredients necessary to constitute a gift

under Muslim Law were not satisfied.

According to the argument of the learned counsel, the donee of this Kadutham, Kadija

Umma did not Signify the acceptance of the gift by affixing her signature on the

Kadutham. The learned counsel for the Appellants argued that a gift in Muslim Law has to

be accepted by the donee and since the bride has not accepted the gift, the gift would

automatically become invalid.

I had occasion to discuss the constitution of a valid gift in Muslim Law in C.A. Case

No.470/1996 (F) &: 470/1996 (F) (A) (D.C. Kalutara Case No.5203/P CA minutes of

31.08.2018) and in the course of the judgment I pointed out that gifts known as Hibath

contains the follOwing characteristics.

1. The manifestation of the wish to give.

2. The acceptance by the donee expressly or impliedly.

3. The taking of immediate possession of the subject-matter of the gift.

In the case of Kuiu Beg Afzal Beg v. Guizar Beg La1 Beg, AIR 1946 NAG 357 it was held:

"once the donor upholds the gift and the donee accepts it, it is a valid gift, and a stranger

cannot question its validity on the grounds of want of delivery of possession". This

judgment confirms acceptance as a fundamental requirement for there to be a valid gift.

However, one finds that it was only the bridegroom who had placed his signature and

accepted the Kadutham. In the course of the argument, this Court posed the question

whether the bridegroom could have accepted the Kadutham on behalf of the bride.

Mr. Sandamal Rajapakse, the learned Counsel for the 6th and 7'h Defendant-Appellants

brought to the notice of the Court that this important question of Muslim Law that

7

figured prominently in this case was not addressed by the learned Additional District

Judge of Galle in his judgment dated 03.11.2000.

Ms. Sudharshani Coorey who appeared for the Plaintiff-Respondent and 3M, 4th, and 8A

Defendant-Respondents stated that the only question that was answered by the learned

Additional District Judge was in relation to the non-compliance of the Kadutham with the

imperative requirements of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and the

learned Counsel pointed out that the question of non-compliance has been adequately

dealt with by the learned Additional District Judge in his judgment wherein he stated

that when P4 (Kadutham) and PS (its English translation) were produced in Court, it was

admitted without any objections. Thus, Ms. Sudharshani Coorey, the learned counsel for

the Plaintiff-Respondent, 3M, 4th and 8A Respondents argued that the said Kadutham had

become admissible evidence against the 6th and the 7'h Defendant-Appellants. She further

argued that the invalidity of the Kadutham was never an issue in the Court a quo.

But in any event, there is evidence that the bride Kadija Umma had not signed the

Kadutham and therefore it becomes a question of law for this Court to consider whether it

constituted a valid gift in Muslim law.

As is apparent, the Kadutham is dated 22.06.1894 and as such this Court is confronted

with a 19th century deed of gift. The executor of this Kadutham Abdul Azeez was long

dead when the trial came about in 1996 and none of the witnesses to the attestation of

this document were alive when this document was produced in the trial.

As correctly submitted by Ms. Sudharshani Coorey, this document will attract the

operation of Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance and moreover the 6th and 7'h

Defendant-Appellants had not objected to, nor did they allow the marking of the

document subject to proof.

The applicability of Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance in relation to a deed in a

partition suit surfaced to the fore in c.A. 1247/2000 (C.A. minutes of 28.06.2018) and I

had occasion to comment on the provision thus:-

8

" ..... The principle underlying Section 90 is that if a document, 30 years old or more, is produced

from proper custody and is, on its face, free from suspicion, the court may presume that it has been

signed or written by a person whose signatures it bears or in whose handwriting it purports to be.

The ground of the rule is the great difficulty, indeed in many cases, the impossibility of proving the

handwriting, execution and attestation of documents in the ordinary way after a lapse of many

years.

Another ground is the circumstances of age, or long existence of the document, together with its

place of custody, its unsuspicious appearance, and perhaps other circumstances, suffice, in

combination, as evidence to be submitted to Court.

Proof of custody is required as a condition of admissibility to afford the court reasonable

assurance of the genuineness of the document as being what it purports to be.

Section 90 does away, ordinarily, with the necessity of proVing those documents,for documents 30

years old are said to prove themselves, that is, no witnesses need, unless the court so requires, be

called to prove their execution or attestation.

This section does away with the strict rules of proof enforceable in the case of private documents

by giving rise to a presumption of genuineness with regard to documents more than 30 years

old ........ "

But the question remains whether the bridegroom could have signed the deed in order to

signify the acceptance on behalf of his bride. When I peruse the English translation of

the Kadutham (P5), I find the word 'assigned' appearing just after the word 'signed' opposite

the name of the bridegroom. It is arguable that the husband was assigned the task of

affixing his signature on behalf of his bride, having regard to the fact that a woman of

Islamic faith, cloistered or otherwise in the 19th century would have hardly ventured out

to sign a Kadutham in front of men particularly on a day her betrothal (Nikah) was taking

place. There is also the probability that the gift may have been aSSigned to the

bridegroom.

9

Quite germane to this aspect of the matter, Ms. Coorey pOinted out that even in the trial

court, the Plaintiff never came forward to give evidence and instead it was her husband

who took the witness stand. Her argument was that time and tide had marched on since

1894 but notwithstanding the march of times, in the trial that began in 1996, the Plaintiff

Kadija Beebi never put her best foot forward to testify.

In my view the Indian case which I have cited above Kulu Beg Afzal Beg v. Guizar Beg

La] Beg, AIR 1946 NAG 357 validates an implied acceptance and the bridegroom's

signature must be treated as an acceptance of the deed of gift on behalf of the bride, given

the times of yore in which the Kadutham came to be executed. I have said that the use of

the word "assigned" in the Kadutham may mean two things. Either the bridegroom was

aSSigned the task of accepting the gift on behalf of his bride or the gifted land was

aSSigned to the bridegroom.

Otherwise why should the word "assigned" appear beside the name of the bridegroom? In

Black's law Dictionary (Tenth Edition, 2014), Assignment has been defined to be a

transfer of rights or property. In other words an assignment is a transfer or making over

to another of the whole of any property, real or personal. So when this word is used in

the Kadutham opposite the signature of the bridegroom, it is intentional and connotes an

assignment of the dower to the bridegroom, which he had accepted by appending his

signature to the Kadutham on 22.06.1894. I must acknowledge that the assignment is as

non-notarial as the gift itself. But despite the informality Kadutham was recognized in

this country and informality of these documents arises because a gift (Hiba) does not

require formalities.

Though a Muslim woman is a feme sole, there is nothing in Muslim law that prevents a

Kadutham being assigned to her husband. In the circumstances I hold that the gift was

validly accepted and on the question of whether the 2nd requirement of a valid gift

namely the donees went into possession, evidence is rife for their possession to be

inferred from attendant and concomitant circumstances.

10

In fact the learned Additional District Judge has himself come to the conclusion that the

Plaintiff who traces her title to the donee Kadeeja Umma had obtained her prescriptive

rights on the land and it is singularly pertinent to point out that the 6th and 7'h Defendant

Appellants have failed to prove possession on their part nor have they adduced any

evidence of possession on the part of their predecessors in title.

One has only to look at the report of the surveyor who conducted the preliminary survey

to gather the extensive possession that the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant (the predecessor in

title of the 8th Defendant) and 4th Defendant. Only those who had long standing interests

in the land had claimed before the surveyor and the 6th and 7'h Defendants were nowhere

there near the surveyor to assert any rights to the land. Neither the 13th nor the 14th

Defendant was present at the survey. Some of the improvements on the land are so old

that it is no wonder that the learned Additional District Judge came to the right

conclusion that the Plaintiff had prescribed to the land. The prescriptive rights would

not have been possible, had Kadeeja Umma and her husband not gone into possession.

The finding of the learned Additional District Judge that the Appellants had not

preSCribed to the land is flawless having regard to the fact that they were conspicuous by

their absence from the preliminary survey and there is want of evidence at the trial of any

prescriptive title accruing to them.

In the circumstances I would perforce affirm the judgment of the court a quo dated

03.11.2000 and proceed to dismiss this appeal.
