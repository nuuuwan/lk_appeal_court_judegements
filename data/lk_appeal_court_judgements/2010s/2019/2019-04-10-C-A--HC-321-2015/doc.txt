ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an appeal by the Accused-Appellant Gampola Vithanage

Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda, (hereinafter referred to as the

1/ Appellant") against his conviction for the counts of possession and

trafficking in 7.05 grams of heroin on or about 04.12.2008 at Mt. Lavinia

and the sentence of death imposed by the High Court of Colombo. The

Appellant invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, seeking to set

aside his conviction and sentence of death.

2

The indictment presented by the Hon. Attorney General, in its

original form, had named the Appellant as the 1st accused, while one

Devamullage Malith Sameera Perera alias Amila was named as the 2nd

accused. Therefore, the allegation by the prosecution against the two

accused at that stage was that they jointly possessed and trafficked the

said quantity of heroin.

Pending trial, the 2nd accused had died, whilst being incarcerated in

Welikada Jail allegedly due to a riotous situation that erupted there.

It appears from the proceedings of 18.05.2015, that the prosecution

sought to amend the indictment with the said change of circumstances, by

the addition of the words "t;z.roo ~O@(3))c3 ElO.ro @~C)ro fJ~aJ @~C)~@(9@<33 (d

o~o @0(60) O(3)" and instead of the word " g~q~" insertion of the word

" g~O". However, the amended indictment only contained the insertion

of the word "g~aJ)". This ambiguous position was noted by the trial Court

and the learned Prosecutor offered a clarification for the basis of liability

as reflected in the proceedings of 10.08.2015.

Thus, it is clear that the case against the Appellant was presented by

the prosecution not on the basis of joint possession and trafficking but on

the basis of his individual act of possession and trafficking.

The prosecution case is IP Rangajeewa, who was attached to Police

Narcotics Bureau at that time, had received information from one of his

private informants at about 8.30 a.m. on 04.12.2008, which he recorded on

page 194 of his Pocket Note Book. The information disclosed that the

Appellant has planned the packeting of heroin in a house at Maharagama

and is waiting near a culvert at Attidiya with one of his associates called

3

Amila who will come there riding a motor cycle bearing registration

number WPMO 2532. The informant also conveyed information about

another group of individuals who would join these two.

Rangajeewa conveyed this information to his superiors and upon

their direction, made preparation to conduct a raid. He directed 51

Wijesinghe to prepare a team of officers. They left their office with a team

of three other police constables and a police driver in a van bearing

registration number HD 2726. The team set off for the raid at about 10.00

a.m. and as they reached Colpetty, the informant had rung up Rangajeewa

to convey the information that the Appellant and Amila have left for Mt.

Lavinia Courts at about 9.15. The Said informant further disclosed that

upon reaching the Courts, the Appellant had gone inside while Amila too

had left in the direction of Watarappola Road. Rangajeewa then instructed

his informant to follow them. When the team reached Dehiwala junction,

the informant had rung up for the 3rd time to inform Rangajeewa that Amila,

having returned from Watarappola Road went again in the direction of the

sea. It was clarified by the prosecution that Watarappola Road is on the

opposite side of Mt. Lavinia Courts, which is situated on the sea side of the

Galle Road. With this information, Rangajeewa decided to turn to Hotel

Road from Galle Road. They travelled along the Hotel Road and upon

arriving at the intersection of College Avenue, observed a motorcycle

bearing number WPMO 2532 was parked along the Hotel Road. They have

reached there at about 10.30 a.m. Rangajeewa saw a male person seated on

the parked motorcycle and while wearing a "full face helmet" he was also

carrying a spare helmet.

4

Upon seeing the motorcyclist, Rangajeewa instructed his driver to turn the

vehicle from the intersection to its right, and proceeded along the other

part of the College Avenue, that leads up to the sea shore. They stopped

the vehicle about 50 meters away from that intersection. Rangajeewa then

got off from the vehicle and walked towards the intersection with 51

Wijesinghe. They have positioned themselves in a way they could have a

clear view of the motorcyclist. A little later, Rangajeewa saw the Appellant,

whose identity was known to him due to the latter's detention at PNB

some time back, coming down College Avenue, whilst engaged in a

telephone call on his hand phone.

The motorcyclist then started the engine of his motorcycle and the

Appellant had walked up to him. The motorcyclist had taken out a parcel

from his back pack. The parcel which could be kept in the clenched fist of a

person was then given to the Appellant. The Appellant was intercepted by

Rangajeewa, when he was about to wear the helmet. 51 Wijesinghe then

helped out the motorcyclist who had toppled over with his motor cycle.

When Rangajeewa took the parcel from the Appellant's hand, he saw

a light blue cellophane bag inside of it. Its top was tied into a knot. To

examine its contents, Rangajeewa had to untie its knot. The parcel had some

brown coloured powder as its contents, and upon smelling and inspection

of the substance, Rangajeewa suspected it to be heroin with his experience.

He put the parcel into his left trouser pocket.

He had then arrested the Appellant and the motorcyclist for

possession of and trafficking in heroin at about 10.50 a.m.

5

The party has then set off to Madiwela house of the Appellant in the

van, with PC 50142 Asela following them with the motorcycle, that had

been taken charge after the arrest of its rider. Having reached the premises

at 33/25, Obewatta Road, Madiwela, Rangajeewa conducted a search of the

two storied house which was being renovated at that time. Rangajeewa has

issued a receipt confirming the arrest of the Appellant to one of the

inmates of this house, Bogahawattage Siriyawathie, who was identified as

one of the Appellant's aunts.

The search of that house yielded nothing, and the party then set off

to Kalubowila in order to carry out a search of a relatively small upstair

house of the 2nd Accused, who was arrested along with the Appellant.

There too the Police made no recoveries. After the two searches, the party

returned to their office at 2.45 p.m., subsequent to refuelling the vehicle at

Narahenpita.

When Rangajeewa tested the contents of the parcel with the test kit it

was positive for heroin and it had a gross weight of 84.2 grams. He

thereafter retied the knot which he untied at the time of initial inspection.

The parcel was sealed at that stage in the presence of the Appellant, after

obtaining his signature on the identification tag. The 2nd Accused was also

present at the time of sealing the parcel.

The productions were handed over by Rangajeewa to the Reservist of

PNB SI Samarakoon on 07.12.2008 at 10.30 a.m., keeping them in his

personal locker since its sealing on 04.12.2008. Samarakoon handed over the

production to Ms Kanchana Ratnapala of the Government Analyst

Department on 08.12.2008 under reference No. C.D. 3605/08 and Senior

6

Assistant Government Analyst Ms K. T. Chandrani commenced her

chemical analysis of its contents on 18.05.2009. Her analysis and report

indicated the parcel had a gross weight of 84.2 grams. The brown powder

had a gross weight of 82.46 grams and the analysis revealed it contained

7.05 grams of pure heroin.

The Prosecution led the evidence of 51 Wijesinghe who assisted

Rangajeewa in the detection of heroin and also of the Officer-in-Charge of

the PNB, Chief Inspector Ludowyk.

When the High Court ruled that there was a case to answer the

Appellant gave evidence under oath denying the charge while claiming it

is an introduction after arresting him near the Court premises. He was

subjected to a lengthy cross examination by the prosecution.

The trial Court, in delivering its 135-page judgment on 14.10.2015

convicted the Appellant on both counts. He was sentenced to death and in

the allocutus the Appellant has reiterated his claim of introduction.

At the hearing of the appeal, learned President's Counsel for the

Appellant contended that he was denied a fair trial and the protection of

the presumption of innocence by the High Court of Colombo. He relied

upon the following factors in support of that contention;

a. the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt,

b. the trial Court failed to properly evaluate the prosecution

evidence for its credibility,

c. prosecution has failed to establish joint possession,

d. prosecution has failed to prove the identity of productions, 7

e. the trial Court misdirected itself when it rejected the

evidence of the Appellant, which was given under oath, by

not affording equal weight the Court had attached to

prosecution evidence.

f. the trial Court was prejudiced with the adverse media

publicity the Appellant received.

The ground of appeal based on the applicability of the provisions of

Section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 was not

urged before us during the hearing of the Appeal but brought up only

with the written submissions which only meant to highlight the "material

points" taken up before us and supporting judicial precedents. Thus, there

was no oral submissions in support of this ground of appeal and no reply

by the Respondent.

Of the several grounds the Appellant has urged before us in support

of his appeal, the complaint that the prosecution has failed to prove its case

and the failure of the trial Court to properly evaluate the prosecution

evidence could conveniently be dealt simultaneously to avoid repetition of

some of the relevant considerations.

Learned President's Counsel founded his argument that the

prosecution has failed to prove its case, on the following factors:-

i. the allegation against the Appellant is a total fabrication by

Rangajeewa as indicative by the facts that there was no identity

of the production detected off the Appellant by the detecting

officer. To impress upon this Court of this point, the

Appellant invited our attention to page 172, where Rangajeewa

8

admitted that the he did not make any entries on the sealed

envelope.

11. the absence of any signature or thumb impression of the 2nd

Accused in the identification tag, that had been included in

the sealed parcel sent for analysis is a clear indication that he

was never there at the time of sealing and is in support of the

Appellant's claim that he was not arrested

111. the prosecution has also failed to produce several other items

said to have been taken charge by the officers at the time of

the alleged arrest of the Appellant,

In support of the contention that the trial Court has failed to

properly evaluate the evidence presented by the prosecution, learned

President's Counsel relied on the following factors:-

1. the prosecution version of events that led to the detection is

improbable,

ii. the trial Court failed to take note of a material contradiction in

the evidence of Rangajwa and Wijesinghe,

iii. it was the position taken by the State that Rangajeewa entered

false entries in the information books.

The contention of the Appellant that Rangajeewa did not make any

entries on the envelope which contained the detected parcel of heroin

9

.~-------------------------------------------------------------------------, .

would not make him disentitled to make a positive identification of the

same. The reason being, he has delegated that task to 51 Wijesinghe who

fulfilled it in his presence. Rangajeewa recognised his own signature and

date which appeared on the same envelope along with the signature of the

Appellant. The Appellant has identified his signature on the envelope

(marked as P3A).

In order to impress upon the falsity of the prosecution version of

events, the Appellant relied heavily on the fact that beyond the point of

sealing there was no evidence in relation to the 2nd Accused before the trial

Court. Rangajeewa admittedly failed to obtain the thumb impression of the

2nd Accused on the identification tag although he obtained it from the

Appellant, who relies on that fact to challenge the reliability of the

evidence of the said witness.

The death of the 2nd Accused occurred when the trial against both of

them was pending before the High Court. At that time the trial Court had

already decided to proceed with the trial in the absence of the Appellant

as it was satisfied that he had absconded after his enlargement on bail.

When Rangajeewa was giving evidence before the trial Court, the case

against the 2nd Accused had already abated due to his death and with the

subsequent amendment to the indictment, the trial proceeded on the basis

of individual criminal liability of the Appellant. It could well be due to this

reason, learned Prosecutor had not probed into this serious lapse by the

witness, in the process of sealing the productions which they claim in the

"joint possession" of both, seeking an explanation from Rangajeewa the only

person who could provide one.

10

If the 2nd Accused was alive and after trial was found guilty to the

two counts along with the Appellant on the basis of joint possession and

joint trafficking, certainly there is merit in what the Appellant submitted.

As already noted, after the amendment, the trial proceeded on the basis of

the Appellant's individual liability. The trial Court had proceeded to

consider the case against the Appellant also on that basis. Therefore, the

mere absence of the 2nd Accused's thumb impression or signature on the

identification tag does not give rise to a reasonable doubt about the

integrity of the production, owing to the claim that it is an "introduction".

The Appellant also contended that the absence of thumb impression

or the signature of the 2nd Accused is a clear indication that he was never

there at the time of sealing the envelope and it is a factor which is in

support of the Appellant's claim that he was not arrested under the

circumstances that the prosecution claims. However, the Appellant himself

admits that the 2nd Accused was arrested by the PNB Officers, thus

negating any significant impact that could result from this lapse by

Rangajeewa.

The contention of the Appellant, that the evidence of the prosecution

in relation to the detection is improbable, is based upon following factors:-

1. that it is not probable to reach Mt. Lavinia from Fort, within

the time span of thirty minutes, with busy Galle Road traffic,

ii. the arrest was made in front of the three wheel stand situated

along College Avenue and therefore it is more probable that

11

the Appellant, who needed to get into a three wheeler taxi to

have come there.

111. Rangajeewa knew that the Appellant was due to arrive at the

Magistrate's Court of Mt.. Lavinia since the case filed by PNB

against him was to be called on that day and therefore

Rangajeewa's claim of a private informant giving out the

details of his planned packeting of heroin is a total fabrication.

The improbability of reaching Mt. Lavinia in thirty minutes would

obviously depend on the intensity of vehicular traffic along the direction of

the journey. It is stated that Rangajeewa received information about the

Appellant's planned activity by 8.30 a.m. As the Learned Deputy Solicitor

General submitted, the party left their office only about 10.00 a.m. It is

common knowledge by that time in the morning, office and school traffic

peak was over. Besides, the officers have travelled out of Colombo and not

towards Colombo. In such a situation, it is not possible to reject the evidence

presented by the prosecution on a mere estimation of the intensity of

vehicular traffic in the absence of specific evidence to justify such a view.

In relation to the improbability of the version of events relied upon

by the prosecution, the Appellant contended that, when considered in the

light of the claim of the Appellant that his arrest was made in front of the

three wheel stand which is located along College Avenue and not near the

Hotel Road intersection as claimed by the prosecution, it is more probable

that he was arrested near the taxi stand as he needed to get into a three

wheeler taxi in order to return home after the Court case.

12

The prosecution version is that the Appellant walked along College

Avenue until he reached the place where the 2nd Accused was waiting for

him with a parcel of heroin. The Appellant, in his evidence claimed that he

was walking along College Avenue to go to the taxi stand, when he was

stopped by Rangajeewa who wanted him to accompany them to record a

statement. When the Appellant suggested to Rangajeewa that he was

arrested near the taxi stand, the witness rejected it.

When the Appellant gave evidence, it was suggested that he need

not walk down College Avenue to secure a taxi and all he needed to do

was to wait along Galle Road to flag down one. It was also suggested to the

Appellant by the prosecution that he was arrested near the intersection, he

denied it.

The incident of detection and arrest as spoken to by the prosecution

took place near the intersection, but along Hotel Road. Clearly the place of

arrest as claimed by the two sides differs to each by few meters. It is

claimed by the prosecution, the Appellant, having walked up to the 2nd

Accused who arrived there on a motorcycle with an extra helmet, had

received a parcel containing heroin just before his detection and arrest.

If the prosecution were to fabricate a false version of events,

suppressing what actually happened at the time of arrest, there must be a

compelling reason for such a fabrication. Shifting the place of arrest by few

meters down the College Avenue will not place the prosecution at any

advantage over the Appellant. If Rangajeewa wanted to concoct a story

against the Appellant, he could well have done that. But in this instance,

the involvement of the 2nd Accused who brought in several other items of

13

productions into the detection. Therefore the shifting of place of arrest

does not place the prosecution at an advantage nor it places it at a

disadvantage. The detection could still be made at the taxi stand.

However, the prosecution evidence is that after the detection,

Rangajeewa instructed one of his officers to follow them on the motorcycle

taken charge from the 2nd Accused after his arrest. The Appellant, although

claimed in his evidence, that the 2nd Accused was already arrested and

kept in the van, however, admitted in his examnation in chief that the

motorcycle followed them on their journey to the Bureau after the

detection and thereby lending credence to the prosecution's claim that it

was taken into their possession along with the detection and arrest.

Nowhere in the Appellant's version did a motorcycle ever feature. Only

the prosecution claimed that the 2nd Accused arrived at the intersection in

a motorcycle where they were eventually arrested.

The other improbability that was highlighted by the Appellant is

based on the fact that Rangajeewa knew that the Appellant was due to

appear before the Magistrate's Court that morning and therefore the

alleged role of the informant is clearly a concoction by the witness. This

position was not suggested to Rangajeewa by the Appellant during cross

examination. After SI Wijesinghe's evidence was concluded, the parties

recorded certain admissions under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. One of the admissions so recorded was that

the Appellant was arrested in Mt. Lavinia "area". In the said admission

14

there was no reference to a Court case to which the Appellant was named

as a suspect, and it was due to be called on that day.

In making the submissions in support of this point, the Appellant

relied on the inference that Rangajeewa, being an officer attached to PNB,

should have known that the case against the Appellant was filed by PNB

was to have called on that day.

This contention needed to be considered against the backdrop of the

relevant evidence to this point that had been placed before the trial Court.

Rangajeewa, in planning the detection upon the information provided by

his private informant, was anticipating a situation where the Appellant

along with several others would engage in packeting of heroin at a place in

Maharagama and at the time of receiving information, the Appellant was

seen near Attidiya culvert.

The informant, by two of his subsequent calls, has shifted the

location of the Appellant to Mt. Lavinia Courts. This change of location

took place only after the police party left their office. Nowhere in the

evidence has a reference been made that the Appellant had a Court case to

attend. There is no evidence that the Appellant was produced before the

Mt. Lavinia Court by Rangajeewa or any of his team mates at any point of

time.

It would certainly be categorised as mere conjecture if the trial

Court was to consider any possibility that has no evidentiary support

either in favour of the prosecution or the defence. Hence, the contention

advanced by the Appellant is not sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution case.

15

The trial Court, after considering the totality of the evidence

presented before it decided to reject the version of events as narrated by

the Appellant and opted to accept the prosecution evidence as a truthful

and reliable account of what happened there at the time of detection.

The Appellant complained about the failure of the prosecution to

lead other items that had been taken charge at the time of his arrest. He

relied on Premaratne v Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 341 in support

of this contention.

In Premaratne v Republic of Sri Lanka (ibid) this Court, having

noted that the officer to whom the accused has surrendered the key to the

padlocked bag, in which heroin was found, and the chief house holder, in

whose house the said bag was recovered, were not called by the

prosecution, held that;

"There was a noteworthy lacuna in the prosecution case in that

no evidence has been led in regard to the other items that were

contained in the bag marked as P4. The truth or otherwise of

Sumanadasa's could have been tested and evaluated had such

evidence been led and if material was elicited about the other

contents of the bag alleged to belong to the accused-appellant."

When the reasoning of this judgment is considered in relation to the

circumstances of the appeal before us, we are not inclined to hold with the

Appellant that the failure to mark the several items that had been taken

charge by the Officers of PNB from the possession of the Appellant and

16

the 2nd Accused at the time of their arrest would cast a serious doubt

about the evidence for the below mentioned reasons.

The list of items are listed out by the witness Mohottige who was the

Court clerk in charge of productions in the Magistrate's Court of Mt.

Lavinia. The list of productions consists of parcel sealed by the

Government Analyst, a motorcycle and its ignition key, a revenue licence,

a drivers licence, an insurance certificate, a deposit slip, a distribution list,

five 51M cards, a back pack with some clothes, and a bank card. These

items had been handed over to the Court Registry by 51 Samarakoon of

PNB on 11.12.2008.

Admittedly the prosecution did not mark any of these items as

productions, although they have itemised them in the indictment as the

productions they intend to produce at the trial.

In its judgment, the trial Court considered marking of these items

as productions as a meaningless exercise since they are not relevant to the

determination of the fundamental issue that must be decided by it. We are

in agreement with this view. These production items, if at all, are relevant

to add credence to the prosecution evidence. Those items could add

consistency and probability to the version of events the prosecution

presented. There were no items among these that the Appellant relied on

in support of his position. Hence, the non production of these items under

these circumstances, could not be equated with that of the situation

considered under Premaratne v Republic of Sri Lanka (supra) .

In supplementing this ground of appeal, the Appellant submitted

that the trial Court has failed to consider the material inconsistencies in

17

. r-------------------------------------------------------------------------~

the prosecution case. The Appellant invited attention of this Court to the

said inconsistencies. One such inconsistency referred to by the Appellant is

in relation to the house of the 2nd Accused. The inconsistency relates to

how many stories it had. This being a trivial inconsistency will not shake

the witness's testimony on its credibility. The other inconsistency

highlighted by the Appellant is that Rangajeewa did not state that he

handed over the productions to Samarakoon. In fact Rangajeewa said in

evidence that he handed over the productions to Samarakoon on 07.12.2008

at 10.30 a.m. Smarakoon confirms this fact in his evidence.

In dealing with the credibility of these witnesses, the trial Court was

mindful of the fact that they are trained and experienced officers and that

is a factor it should take note of. In fact the trial Court stated so in its

judgment.

The Appellant, in a rather strange attempt to impeach the credibility

of Rangajeewa, sought to rely on a submission made by the prosecutor in a

case where the said witness was apparently cited as a suspect. Learned

President's Counsel for the Appellant tendered a photo copy of the said

submissions in which apparently a reference had been made to an instance

where Rangajeewa has made a false entry to show that he was in Chilaw

when he was seen near Nalanda College, Colombo.

There was no objection by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General to

this attempted introduction of new material without following the

procedure laid down in Section 351 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979.

18

~------------------------------------------------------------------------~

We do not think it is appropriate for this Court to consider a

submission of a prosecutor in an unrelated case, in determining the issue

whether the trial Court has arrived at a correct decision to accept

Rangajeewa's evidence as truthful and reliable account. This kind of

unorthodox methods should be discouraged and frowned upon sending

out a clear message to stem a possible influx of similar applications. The

matter referred to by the Appellant is still pending before a Court of law

on one hand and on the other, it is manifestly unreasonable by the

witness, to challenge his credibility in his absence without affording an

opportunity to offer his explanation.

The ground of appeal of the Appellant that the prosecution failed to

establish joint possession is clearly a misconceived one. In the preceding

paragraphs we have dealt with this issue in different contexts. Clearly the

prosecution presented its case before the High Court alleging the

Appellant as the only accused with its amendment to the indictment upon

the death of the 2nd Accused. The word "g~~" was amended to read

" g~O)". The trial Court, at the very commencement of its judgment,

clearly indicate that the trial has proceeded on an allegation of conscious

and exclusive possession of heroin of the Appellant and not on joint

possession. Therefore, the failure to lead evidence in relation to the 2nd

Accused and failure to consider the evidence that had been placed in

relation to the 2nd Accused by the trial Court has no relevance to the appeal

by the Appellant against his conviction which was based on individual

liability.

19

Learned President's Counsel for the Appellant relied heavily on the

ground of appeal that the prosecution failed to prove the identity of

productions.

It was urged before us that after opening the cellophane bag by

untying its top, Rangajeewa had put it in his trouser pocket without retying

the knot. He has retied the top of the cellophane bag only at the point of its

sealing at the PNB. This was after inspecting two houses and spending

several hours in carrying out further investigations. Thus, the learned

President's Counsel stressed the point that due to this fault on the part of

the detecting officer, the integrity of the production was gravely

compromised.

In addition, it was contended that after the sealing of the envelope

on 04.12.2008, it was kept in the personal locker of Rangajeewa without

handing it over to the Reservist of the PNB, 51 Samarakoon. The envelope

was eventually handed over to Samarakoon by Rangajeewa only on

07.12.2008 at 10.30 a.m. The learned President's Counsel was critical on the

conduct of the prosecution for its failure to clarify from Samarakoon during

his evidence as to the reason why the envelope could not be taken charge

on 04.12.2008 itself, but sought to introduce hearsay explanation through

CI Ludowyk, who was not the Officer-in-Charge at that time, by

producing entries made by Samarakoon.

Learned President's Counsel relied on another alleged gap in the

production chain by placing reliance on the judgment of Kunja v Attorney

General in CA 92/2007 - decided on 06.07.2018 where this Court thought

it fit to interfere with the conviction, upon the failure of the prosecution to

20

lead the evidence of the officer who received the productions at the

Government Analyst Department from the Police officer. It was contended

that the officer who received the parcel at the Government Analyst

Department, Ms Ratnapala from 51 Samarakoon was not called by the

prosecution before the trial Court, and thereby causing a break of an

"essential link" in the production chain.

In relation to Court proceedings, learned President's Counsel

highlighted that the parcel containing heroin, marked as PS, was never

shown to and identified by the Additional Government Analyst Ms.

Chandrani who claims to have analysed its contents and issued a report.

The Appellant relied on the reasoning of the judgment in Premaratne v

Republic of Sri Lanka(1998) 3 Sri L.R. 341 in support of his contention.

Further it was submitted by the Appellant that during the trial it

was elicited from the Police Officers that the substance they claimed to

have detected from the Appellant appeared at that point of time as brown

powder is not found in the parcel shown to them in Courts. Instead what

was found there appeared as a black sticky Tar like substance. The

Appellant was critical of the attempt by the prosecution in offering a

clarification to the transformation in appearance of the substance, through

the partisan Police witnesses, when an expert's opinion could have been

easily presented before the trial Court for its consideration.

In countering the submissions of the Appellant in respect of the

delay in sealing and the failure to place a knot, Learned Deputy Solicitor

General submitted that during the four-hour gap between the detection

and sealing of the parcel containing heroin, there was no opportunity for

21

any other person to tamper with the production since it remained in the

exclusive personal custody of Rangajeewa. He further submitted if

Rangajeewa's evidence is accepted as credible in respect of the detection,

then his evidence in relation to the custody of productions is also equally

acceptable.

He added that Samarakoon who reported to work as PNB Reservist

on 04.12.2008, had left for Wellawaya on that day to attend Court and only

upon his return on 07.12.2008 the sealed parcel that had been kept in the

personal locker of Rangajeewa was handed over. Here again, the evidence

of Rangajeewa on the safe custody of productions is acceptable if his

evidence is believed on the detection. It was also submitted by the

Respondent that the explanation of gradual transformation of the brown

powder into a tar like substance is based on the experience of the officers

who are regularly involved with the handling of such substances and the

prosecution merely relied on the change of physical appearance of the

substance rather than its chemical composition, when it led that evidence

before the trial Court.

Before this Court ventures to consider the submissions of the parties

on this particular ground of appeal in the light of the evidence presented

before the trial Court, it is appropriate to undertake a survey of the

principles laid down by relevant judicial precedents in relation to the

matters that should be proved in support of the production chain.

In Perera v Attorney General (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 378, it was held that:

22

lilt is a recognised principle that in a case of this nature, the

prosecution must prove that the productions had been

forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody without

allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no

opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production

till they reach the Government Analyst. Therefore it is

correct to state that the most important journey is the

inwards journey because the final Analyst report will be

depending on that. The outward journey does not attract the

same importance."

Delivering the Judgment of The Queen v Kularatne 71 NLR 529, the

Court of Criminal Appeal observed that " ... the identity of productions must

be accurately proved by direct evidence, which is available, and not by way of

inference. "

It appears that these judgments have laid down somewhat of an

inflexible and absolute rule in proving the identity of productions and its

proper custody.

In English Courts, the question of proof of "chain evidence" and the

applicable considerations are spelt out, by adopting a more pragmatic

approach as seen in a relatively recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in

DPP v Hawkins [2014] IECCA 36, which states thus:

"No doubt, in very many cases, the prosecution wish to

exercise a counsel of prudence, whereby everything that is

capable of mathematical proof will be testified to in that way.

This approach, however, does not mean that there is any

23

higher standard in criminal cases than that the jury should

be satisfied of the provenance of relevant exhibits beyond

reasonable doubt and that such facts as are proven beyond

reasonable doubt must ultimately be analysed as to whether

these prove the guilt of the accused persons beyond

reasonable doubt on any or more counts. There can be some

instances where the writing of an appropriate name and

number on a bag may suffice to establish its provenance to

that standard. The failure to call a chain of evidence in

between to explain to the jury how that physical evidence

came to be in one place when it was found to be an another

may not otherwise be necessary. In circumstances where

gaps are left by the prosecution, however, these may be such

that a reasonable doubt as to the provenance of physical

evidence, or their relationship to the proof of the offence, may

be absent."

A similar and more accommodative approach was adopted in local

jurisdiction as well when one considers the following judicial precedents.

The judgment of Prins v Sabaratnam 34 N.L.R. 164 deals with a

situation where opium and" ganja" was detected at Skinner Road and the

productions were sealed at Kotahena Police Station only on the next day.

Rejecting the contention advanced by the Appellant on the procedure

adopted by the Police in sealing them, Jayawardene, J. was of the opinion

that:

24

"After examining authorities, I am of the opinion that there

is no imperative or inflexible rule that the articles or things

seized should be sealed immediately after seizure in the

presence of the accused and before they are removed to the

Police Station. The delay in sealing, and informalities in the

manner in which the search is conducted, are circumstances

to be weighed in the consideration of the case and often

diminish the weight of the evidence given as to the possession

of the incriminating articles, and have seriously affected the

credit to be attached to the evidence in many cases. They do

not however preclude the admission of such evidence. it

seems desirable, nevertheless, that the articles found should

be sealed, wherever practicable, immediately after search in

the presence of the accused and before removal to the Police

Station. Failure in this respect is not an irregularity fatal to

a conviction for unlawful possession, provided that the oral

evidence is otherwise satisfactory. /I

The judgment of a divisional bench of this Court in Hultes v

Attorney General (1989) 1 Sri L.R. 204, considered the question of any

discrepancy in the weight and size of the production in a case where

possession of heroin was alleged and concluded that they are insufficient

to cast a doubt on the evidence of identity of productions.

We must consider the grounds of appeal on the identity of

productions, as raised by the Appellant, in the light of the above principles.

The claim by the Appellant that the failure of Rangajeewa to maintain

the "integrity of the substance" when he took the parcel off the Appellant

25

poses a serious challenge to the credibility of the production chain needs to

be considered first.

This complaint stems from the evidence that Rangajeewa did not put

a knot after examining the brown powder that was found inside the

cellophane bag until he returned to his station after four hours since its

detection. The Appellant, in his cross examination of Rangajeewa only

suggested that he had nothing in possession at the time of his arrest.

During his evidence before the trial Court, the Appellant testified that after

his arrest near the Courts, he was taken in the van to pump fuel at

Narahenpita, and thereafter brought back to Badowita of Watarappola area.

Having stopped the vehicle in front of a house, Rangajeewa climbed to its

roof, after a brief telephone conversation with someone, and picked up a

parcel. When the Appellant was produced before the Oicer-in-Charge of

PNB later in the day, he was told there was heroin.

Thus, it is clear that the Appellant's position is that the parcel

containing the prohibited dangerous drug was retrieved from a roof top

and was later produced to PNB along with him. The Appellant thereby

implies that the parcel containing heroin was introduced on him by

Rangajeewa whilst being produced at the PNB.

Irrespective of the Appellant's position, the prosecution must prove

that what had been analysed by the Government Analyst had been

recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the Appellant

beyond reasonable doubt.

In order to establish this important fact in issue, the prosecution

presented oral evidence of Rangajeewa, Wijesinghe and Samarakoon who

26

have made contemporaneous records of the detection, sealing, custody and

handing over of the prohibited substance.

It is obvious, the prosecution relies on the oral evidence of

Rangajeewa and Wijesinghe to establish the conscious and exclusive

possession of 7.05 grams of heroin by the Appellant. As the Learned

Deputy Solicitor General submits, if their evidence is accepted by the trial

Court in relation to the detection as truthful and reliable account of the

sequence of events, then Rangajeewa's evidence that he kept the untied

parcel of heroin in his trouser pocket until its presentation to the PNB after

retying the knot and sealing it with the signature of the Appellant also

should be accepted in support of the integrity of the substance. The

Appellant did not challenge the evidence of the prosecution that the

integrity of the substance of the parcel that had been taken from his

possession was compromised by introduction of some other substance.

Similarly, the same logic applied to the period in which the sealed

parcel was kept in the personal locker of Rangajeewa until it was handed

over to the Reservist Samarakkon three days later.

Having carefully examined the available evidence on the point, we

are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the integrity of the substance

was not compromised during the brief period it was kept in the trouser

pocket of Rangajeewa before it was properly sealed and the three-day

period during which it was lying in his personal locker. We further hold

that there was no basis 'for any suspicion that there had been an opportunity for

tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the Government

Analyst" as per Perera v Attorney General (supra). The prosecution is

27

bound only to establish proper custody beyond reasonable doubt and

not on absolute proof.

The fact that the prosecution has failed to call the Assistant

Government Analyst Ms. Ratnapala to whom the sealed envelope was

handed over by SI Samarakoon on 08.12.2008, in the light of the

pronouncement of the judgment of Kunja v Attorney General (supra)

should be considered next.

In the said judgment Wickremasinghe J stated that II one K.P.

Chandrani had handled productions at a subsequent stage of inward journey and

she had not been called to give evidence. Therefore, the prosecution had failed to

establish the chain of the custody of production beyond reasonable doubt." Her

Ladyship was guided by the unreported judgment of Nilam v Attorney

General- CA 98/2002 where it has been held that " ... the prosecution cannot

escape from the responsibility of proving the inward journey of the production

beyond any reasonable doubt and establish the inward journey in order to show

that the productions were never tampered with at any stage of the inward journey

which is much more significant and relevant than the outward journey."

The circumstances that are presented in relation to the instant appeal

are clearly different to that of Kunja v Attorney General (supra). The

prosecution presented clear and unambiguous evidence before the trial

Court, until Ms. Chandrani opened the envelope to commence her analysis

of its contents on 18.05.2009, its seals were intact as it was received by Ms.

Ratnapala on 08.12.2008 from SI Samarakoon of PNB. Unlike in Kunja v

Attorney General, the prosecution has presented Ms. Chandrani's evidence

by calling her as a witness.

28

After consideration of the above, one other matter raised by the

Appellant remains to be considered. That is the complaint by the Appellant

that although the Government Analyst had analysed the contents, the

prosecution had failed to prove P5 through the expert witness. The

prosecution marked the substance inside the cellophane bag as P5 through

Rangajeewa. At the time of the trial, the said substance appeared as a wad

of tar although at the time of detection it appeared as a quantity of brown

powder. Rangajeewa provides an explanation to this transformation in

appearance of the substance he detected. According to the witness, the

brown powder, over the passage of time, transforms itself into a substance

like tar. He therefore claims to have identified P5 with the help of the

envelope which contained his signature and the identification tag which

also contained signatures of him and the Appellant.

The Government Analyst, in her evidence also identified the same

identification tag and envelope by her signatures placed on them. She

inserted her signatures (P2X) on these items at the time of her analysis. She

also identified the blue cellophane bag in which the substance she analysed

was found (P4) on which also she has placed her signature. She identified

her signature on the identification tag (P3) that had been inserted along

with the blue cellophane bag containing heroin. She confirms that after

analysis of the substance using several chemical tests, it was concluded

that the brown powder contained 7.05 grams of pure heroin.

It is correct that the prosecution has failed to identify the heroin

(now turned to a wad of tar) through the expert witness since P5 was not

shown to her. It is the consistent practice of all prosecutors that the

quantity of heroin is shown to the expert witness and elicit evidence as to 29

its identification. Perhaps due to an oversight, the learned prosecutor has

not shown P5 to the expert witness.

In the circumstances, this Court must now decide the effect of that

failure in relation to the prosecution case.

As referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the substance that had

been shown before the trial Court to Rangajeewa has undergone physical

changes and therefore does not appear to be the substance he detected in

the possession of the Appellant in appearance. The brown powder that was

there at the time of detection has now transformed itself into a wad of tar

like substance. In its strict sense, if not for the associating documentary

evidence which contained his signature and handwriting, even Rangajeewa

might not be able to identify P5. Similarly even if P5 is shown to

Government Analyst Ms Chandrani, she would identify P5 only, with such

supporting documentary evidence. When considered in the light of the

said reasoning, although it is highly desirable for the prosecution to have

theP5 identified by the expert witness as the substance that he or she has

analysed, the mere non-identification of the substance does not necessarily

affect the prosecution case adversely. Clearly there was evidence before

the trial Court that Ms. Chandrani has identified the cellophane bag in

which the substance was contained and its identification tag. This evidence

is sufficient to decide the fact in issue before the trial Court

In expanding his submissions on this point, learned President's

Counsel complained that the trial Court had quite mistakenly considered

that P5 was proved by the prosecution through the expert witness. Clearly

it is an erroneous assumption that P5 was identified by the expert witness

30

on the part of the trial Court. However, in view of the above-mentioned

considerations, we are of the view that this erroneous conclusion reached

by the trial Court would not have any adverse effect on its judgment, since

clearly it had not prejudiced the Appellant. Hence, we hold that non-

identification of P5 by the expert witness, does not create a reasonable

doubt as to the identity of the production. There is no possibility of the

Appellant's interests being prejudiced due to this obvious lapse on the part

of the prosecutor and the mistaken view of fact by the trial Court.

Another complaint, connected to the same issue, presented before us

by the Appellant was that the tar like substance has not been explained

through the expert while an attempt was made through Rangajeewa to

explain the transformation in appearance of the substance detected. The

evidence of the witness reveals that he too received specialised training in

the detection and identification of the dangerous drugs including heroin.

He claims to have field experience, over a period of seven years, as an

officer of the PNB.

In any event, he has claimed that brown powder would over the

years transform itself into a tar like substance and in this particular

instance too, the production marked P5 has undergone that natural

transformation. The prosecution did not elicit from this witness of the

chemical details of this transformation but limited it to the mere physical

changes that occur to brown powder containing heroin, over time.

Therefore, we do not consider the evidence of Rangajeewa as a scientific

explanation for the changes that had taken place in the substance he has

detected some seven years back. It would have been most appropriate if

the prosecution has provided a scientific explanation for the appearance of 31

the substance in P5, through the opinion of an expert, under Section 45 of

the Evidence Ordinance. This attempt by the prosecution to provide an

explanation through Rangajeewa is something akin to a police officer

smelling the barrel of a gun and stating that it had been fired recently. It is

a mere observation that needed no expertise in a particular field.

Moving our attention to the evidence of the Appellant that had been

placed before the trial Court, learned President's Counsel contended that

it has misdirected itself to reject the evidence of the Appellant, which was

given under oath, by affording unequal weight with the evidence of the

prosecution, thereby acting contrary to the principle laid down in the

unreported judgment of this Court, Sisira Bandula alias Mahatun v

Attorney General CA 122/2006 - decided on 09.10.2014, where Gooneratne

J observed that;

"It is very unfortunate that this Court has to observe that

the trial Judge has not considered and given his mind to the

defence case properly. If there were contradictions, it is the

duty of the trial Judge to deal with them in the same manner

he dealt with the prosecution case and decided as to whether

such infirmities go to the root of the defence case. The prime

duty of the trial Judge is to weigh the evidence correctly and

decide whether the defence case is capable of creating a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. Instead he has

allowed himself to be influenced by importing his personal

knowledge. However good or bad the witness or whether he

has a bad track record should be forgotten and not the 32

~~-------------------------------------------------------------------------,

deciding factor. Trial Judge should only concentrate on the

evidence before Court."

It is submitted that the trial Court did not consider the Appellant's

evidence on its credibility and if acceptable whether it would create a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. It was also contended that the

trial Court has compared the prosecution case along with that of the

Appellant, an approach that had been frowned upon by this Court in

James Silva v The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 167, with the

following pronouncement;

"It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct himself

that he must examine the tenability and the truthfulness of

the evidence of the defence in the light of the evidence led by

the prosecution. Our criminal law postulates a fundamental

presumption of legal innocence of every accused till the

contrary is proved. This is rooted in the concept of legal

inviolability of every individual in our society, now

enshrined in our Constitution. There is not even a surface

presumption of truth in the charge with which an accused is

indicted. Therefore to examine the evidence of the accused in

the light of the prosecution witnesses is to reverse the

presumption of innocence."

The trial Court, in its impugned judgment has considered the

prosecution and defence evidence for its credibility and then arrived at the

33

conclusion that the evidence of the Appellant is unworthy of any credit

and rejected the same. In relation to the prosecution evidence it has arrived

at the conclusion that they are worthy of credit and therefore could be

acted upon. In view of the complaint by the Appellant that his evidence

was rejected on the "unequal" consideration, we consider it appropriate at

this juncture to examine the reasoning of the trial Court in rejecting his

evidence.

In its 135-page judgment, the trial Court has devoted 56 pages to

consider the evidence of the Appellant which has spread over 532 pages of

proceedings. The trial Court has applied the tests of spontaneity,

consistency and probability in evaluating the Appellant's evidence in

order to determine his testimonial trustworthiness. The trial Court noted

that the Appellant's evidence is inconsistent, improbable and false.

Learned President's Counsel was critical that during the Appellant's

evidence, the prosecution has cross examined as if the matter before Court

was a "money laundering charge" and as a result, many irrelevant

considerations were brought in as evidence which tended to cloud the

mind of the trial Judge.

The Appellant was admittedly subjected to a session of intense cross

examination by the prosecution which continued over several days.

Coomaraswamy in his treatise The Law of Evidence (Vol.II, Book 2,

page 722) identifies two categories upon which cross examination of a

witness is to be conducted. He states that "facts which are relevant to the

issue" and "facts which affect the credibility of the witness" as those two

categories. He further lays down the following 10 areas (at p.723) under

34

which the cross examination as to facts affecting credibility could be

conducted since" relevance to credit is a very elastic concept";

"(a) The knowledge of the witness of the facts to which he testifies

and his means of knowledge;

(b) His Intelligence, and powers of memory and perception;

(c) His disinterestedness or bias;

(d) His integrity;

(e) His veracity;

(j) His understanding of the fact he is bound to speak the truth

by his oath or affirmation;

(g) His opportunities of observation;

(h) His reasons for recollection or belief;

(i) His experience and any special circumstances affecting his

competency to speak to the particular case,

(j) The errors, omissions, contradictions, and improbabilities in

his testimony."

The Appellant, although founded his complaint on general terms,

citing them as irrelevancies, however did not make any specific references

to evidence. When the cross examination of the Appellant is considered it

has spread from the detection to his acquisition of considerable wealth

35

consisting of houses in the more affluent residential areas of Colombo city

within a comparatively short span of time, a fleet of luxury vehicles and

millions of Rupees in cash kept in lockers of commercial banks, which he

attributed to as income derived from the sale of his share of coconuts from

a 15 acre estate, sale of eggs and pineapple. He also claims his wife was

engaged in money lending business which yielded a substantiate profit

He was cross examined on his stint of self-exile in India and Pakistan due

to perceived threat to his life from then Member of Parliament Duminda

Silva with whom he maintained a relationship which deteriorated when he

wanted his money back. During cross examination, the Appellant, in order

to impress upon Court of the nature of his relationship with Duminda Silva,

claimed that Silva introduced him to another Member of Parliament Sarana

Gunawardana, in order to secure a contract for a fuel distribution depot,

during the period during which their relationship flourished. He was also

cross examined on his knowledge about the continuing drug trafficking

activities of one Siddique in India whilst being under his care.

Given the accepted broader view of its scope, the approach adopted

by the prosecution in cross examination of the Appellant could not be

faulted, if it had not transgressed beyond the limitations that have been

imposed in order to protect an Accused in his capacity as a witness for the

defence. There were no such complaints by the Appellant.

The specific instance that was highlighted by the Appellant was that

the prosecution cross examined him on the detection only once which

could be found at p. 1027 although he was cross examined extensively on

many other matters. However, a closer examination of the proceedings of

the Appellant's evidence revealed that this is not the case. The prosecution 36

has cross examined the Appellant on the incident at pages 897, 1007, 1012

and 1022, in addition to page 1027.

It is our view that the rejection of the Appellant's evidence as false

by the trial Court is justified. In doing so it has considered them under the

accepted tests on credibility.

The fact in issue before the trial Court was whether the Appellant

consciously and exclusively possessed 7.05 grams of heroin on 04.12.2008

at Mt. Lavinia.

The Appellant, in his evidence claimed that his arrest did not take

place at the place where the prosecution alleged, but at a point several

meters up in the College Avenue near the taxi park. In relation to the

detection, his position is he did not possess any heroin, and it was

introduced to him at the PNB by Rangajeewa, who retrieved a parcel from a

roof top of a house in Badowita. He further elaborated that when he was

kept in front of that house one of his aunts had given him a bottle of water

to drink. He further claimed that the 2nd Accused, having already been

arrested by PNB Officers, was there in the van when he was put into it

after his arrest near the taxi park.

It is strange that the Appellant did not put any of these positions he

had explained so descriptively in his evidence in relation to the detection

by Rangajeewa and the arrest of the 2nd Accused when the learned defence

Counsel cross examined Ranjeewa and Wijesinghe. This evidence is

important to decide the fundamental fact in issue before the trial Court.

He only suggested to Rangajeewa that he was arrested near the park. No

37

~------------------------------------------------------------------------~

suggestion was made to Wijesinghe on the introduction of drugs, except to

suggest that nothing was recovered from the Appellant at the time of his

arrest. Therefore, the claim of introduction of drugs is clearly an

afterthought by the Appellant, when he raised it at the very end of the

trial for the first time.

The complaint by the learned President's Counsel was that the trial

Court has compared the evidence of the prosecution and defence in

deciding his guilt erroneously as per the judgment of James Silva v The

Republic of Sri Lanka (supra).

In consideration of the manner of presentation of evidence in the

judgment by the trial Court, we are of the view that it adopted the

following approach, that had been recommended by the said judgment, in

following decision of the Privy Council in Jayasena v The Queen 72 N.L.R.

313.

/I A satisfactory way to arrzve at a verdict of guilt or

innocence is to consider all the matters before the Court

adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in its

totality without compartmentalising and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the

particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charges

or not guilty.

The contention that the trial Court was prejudiced with the adverse

media publicity the Appellant received has no merit. It has not been

brought to the notice of the trial Court of any such adverse media

references to the Appellant during the pendency of his trial. The trial

38

. ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------,

..

against the Appellant has proceeded before a Judge and in the absence of a

jury, whose members lack any legal training unlike professional Judges.

This ground would have some relevance if the trial was before a Jury.

In the concluding paragraphs of the judgment under the heading

"@ajc;~)C)~ <!log B qlO)QlC)", the trial Court has considered the issue whether

the Appellant had the conscious and exclusive possession of heroin and

having satisfied itself of that issue, proceeded thereafter to convict him on

the two counts. This conviction is based on the evidence of the witnesses

who have given evidence before the trial Judge who delivered the

judgment. In accepting their evidence as truthful and reliable, the trial

Court had clearly had the benefit of observing the demeanour and

deportment of the witnesses when they gave evidence before it.

When a trial Court decides a question of fact and credibility of

witnesses, on that demeanour and deportment the Appellate Courts are

slow to interfere with such determinations, as per the judgment of

Attorney General v. Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292.

The several grounds of appeal as raised by the Appellant are

therefore clearly without merit.

This prosecution relied on the judgment of Ekanayaka v Attorney

General CA 203/2013 - decided on 02.09.2015, cited the judgment of

Prasad and Another v State (Delhi Administration) where it was iterated

that:

39

. ~----------------------------------------------------------------------~

II A criminal trial is meant for doing justice to the accused,

victim and the society so that law and order is maintained. A

Judge does not preside over a criminal trial merely to see that

no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see

that a guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the

other. Both are public duties."

It is our view that the trial Court has adequately fulfilled its duty by

the Appellant, the State and the society at large in arriving at a finding that

has evidentiary support. We concur with the conclusion of the trial Court

that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, we affirm the conviction of the Appellant and the sentence of

death imposed on him.

The appeal of the Appellant is therefore dismissed.
