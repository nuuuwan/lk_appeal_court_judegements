ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the "Respondent") made an application to the Magistrate' s Court of

Embilipitiya, under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act No. 7 of 1979 as amended, seeking an order of ejection of the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"Appellant") upon her failure to hand over the State land described in its

schedule.

The appellant was thereafter summoned to show cause by the

Magistrate's Court. She has tendered an affidavit in support of her claim

2

that the State land in respect of which she was summoned to show cause

had been in their possession since 1879. She also relied on the deed of gift

No. 1420 of 08.09.1925 to impress upon the Court that she had title to the

said State land.

Having considered the material placed before it, the Magistrate's

Court of Embilipitiya concluded that she has failed to satisfy Court that she

has a "valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law" and proceeded to issue the impugned order of

ejection on 27.06.2014.

The Appellant thereafter invoked revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Embilipitiya

to set aside the said order of ejection. After an inquiry the Provincial High

Court refused the Appellant's application to set aside the order of ejection

and proceeded to dismiss her petition on the premise that there were no

exceptional circumstances disclosed, warranting its intervention.

Being aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, the Appellant now

invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the order of the

Provincial High Court as well as the order of ejectment issued by the

Magistra te' s Court.

The Appellant was represented in Court upon notice and has

obtained her copy of the appeal brief on 05.09.2018. When her appeal was

taken up for hearing before us, on 01.12.2018 the parties indicated their

willingness to dispose this matter on written submissions. The parties

were then directed by this Court to tender written submissions on or

before 25.02.2019 and they were also informed that the judgment would be

pronounced today. However, the Appellant opted not to comply with the

direction of Court.

In these circumstai,.ces, this Court will consider her appeal on the

grounds that are raised in her petition. Although the appellant described

her grounds of appeal under five separate heads, the underlying complaint

is that the land has not properly been identified by the Magistrate's Court

when it issued the impugned order of ejectment.

The basis of the Appellant's submission is that the land in dispute is

not properly identified by the Respondent and that it is not State land since

she has independent title to it by way of a deed.

If this submission is accepted as the correct statement of the

applicable law, then it places a duty on the Magistrate's Court to inquire

into the question whether the land in question is in fact a State land or not.

Clearly the applicable relevant statutory provisions do no support such a

proposition.

4

Once an application is made to the Magistrate's Court by a

Competent Authority in compliance with the relevant statutory provisions

of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, it has no

jurisdiction to inquire into the question whether the land in dispute is in

fact a State land or not. It has been held by this Court in Farook v

Gunewardene, Government Agent, Amparai (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 243 that:-

"Section 9(2) is to the effect that the Magistrate cannot

call for any evidence from the Competent Authority in

support of the-application under Section 5, which mean

the Magistrate cannot call upon the Competent

Authority to prove that the land described in the

schedule to the application is a State land (Section

5 (1)(a) (ii)). Therefore, the Petitioner will not have an

oppor,tunity raising the question whether the land is a

State or private land before the Magistrate."

It is further held that:-

"structure of the act also make it appear that where

the Competent Authority had formed the opinion that

any land is State land, even the Magistrate is not

competent to question his opinion."

Thus, it is clear that the both Courts have employed the relevant

statutory provisions in determining the dispute presented before the

5

respective Courts and have arrived at legally valid determinations at the

end.

Another complaint of the Appellant is that the description of the

land in the quit notice and the application for an order of eje'ctment are

different. This particular complaint was in fact considered and rejected by

the Magistrate's Court after reproducing the two schedules in its order

which clearly indicates that the boundaries are identical. We have

considered the reasoning of Court and found that it had arrived at a

correct finding of fact.

In view of this con~lusion, we are unable to accept the validity of the

submission of the Appellant. Therefore, we affirm the orders made by both

Courts.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs.15,OOO.OO.
