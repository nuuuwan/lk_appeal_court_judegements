Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner company filed this application seeking to quash

P25 whereby the Conservator General of Forests directed the

petitioner to obtain, in terms of the Gazette Notification

No.1161/6 dated 2000.12.05 marked P19, Export Permit for the

exportation of consignments of MDF (Medium Density Fibre)

Boards mainly made of rubber wood.

It is the contention of the petitioner that Export Permit is not

necessary for exportation of the said finished product.

Section 24(1)(p) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance, which

was introduced for the first time by the amending Act No. 23 of

1995, read as follows:

The Minister may make regulations respecting the transit of

all forest produce by land or water. Such regulations may,

among other matters

(p) regulate the import and export of timber and seeds

of forest, tree species and other forest produce and

provide for the issue of permits for the same.

By the amending Act No. 65 of 2009, which became law on

16.11.2009, the above quoted section 24(1)(p) was repealed and

replaced with the new sub sections (p), (q) and (r).

After the last amendment by Act No. 65 of 2009, section 24(1),

insofar as relevant to the present purposes, reads as follows:

24(1) The Minister may make regulations respecting the

transit of all forest produce by land, air or water. Such

regulations may, among other matters:

3

(p) regulate the import and export of timber and forest

produce and the levying of fees;

(q) prohibit the export from Sri Lanka of any timber or

forest produce, except under the authority of a permit

issued for such purpose by the Conservator-General

of Forests; and

(r) prohibit the export of any specified timber or forest

produce.

The Minister may direct that any regulation made under

this section shall not apply to any specified class of timber

or other forest produce or to any specified local area.

The learned counsel for the petitioner for the first time in the

written submissions has mounted the argument that, after

repealing of section 24(1)(p) by the amending Act No. 65 of 2009,

the regulations made by the Minister under the repealed section

and published in the Government Gazette No. 1161/6 dated

05.12.2000 under Export of Timber Seeds of Forest Tree Species

or Other Forest Produce Regulations No.1 of 2000 marked P19

are invalid. This is a valid argument which cuts across the 1st-

3rd respondents case/defence.

The Gazette P19 referred to by the Conservator General of

Forests in P25 dated 02.12.2015 which is sought to be quashed

in these proceedings contains Regulations made by the Minister

of Forestry and Environment by virtue of the powers vested in him

by section 24(1)(p) of the Forest Ordinance (Chapter 451) as

amended by Act, No. 23 of 1995. Those Regulations made

under the repealed section 24(1)(p) of the Forest Ordinance as

amended by Act, No. 23 of 1995 have no force in law after the

amending Act No. 65 of 2009, which became law on 16.11.2009.

4

No Regulations under the new section 24(1)(p)-(r) regarding

import and export of timber or forest produce have been made

up to now by the Minister.

By the last amending Act No. 65 of 2009, section 64 was also

repealed and replaced with a new section, to which, inter alia,

the following new sub sections were added.

64(3) Every regulation made by the Minister shall be

published in the Gazette and shall come into operation on

the date of such publication or on such later date as may be

specified in the regulation.

64(4) Every regulation made by the Minister shall, within

one month after its publication in the Gazette, be brought

before Parliament for approval.

64(5) Every regulation which is not so approved shall be

deemed to be rescinded as from the date of such

disapproval but without prejudice to anything previously

done thereunder.

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that, for the time being, there is

no law, which requires Export Permit to be obtained for the

exportation of timber or forest produce, and therefore P25

decision of the Conservator General of Forests is ultra vires.

Hence I quash the same by certiorari.

Even though this is sufficient for the present purposes, for

completeness, I must deal with the other arguments put forward

by the learned counsel for the petitioner.

Another argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is

that:

5

Section 24(1)(p) of the amending Act No. 65 of 2009 does

not vest any power on the Minister to make regulations for

the issue of permits to export forest produce. Instead, the

Minister has been given the power only to make regulations

for levying of fees.1

I am unable to agree.

What section 24(1) says is that the Minister can make

regulations, among other matters, to regulate the import and

export of timber and forest produce and the levying of fees. List

is not exhaustive, and the power to make regulations in respect

of issuance of permits for importation and exportation of timber

and forest produce has not been excluded or prevented. By the

said amendment, enforcement has not been curtailed but

strengthened in many respects. Empowering the Minister to

make regulations for levying fees for importation and exportation

of timber and forest produce is an additional feature which was

not there before the amendment. Levying a fee is not a

substitution for an export licence.

By this amendment the following new section was also

introduced as 24A.

24A (1) It shall be lawful for an officer of the Department of

Customs to levy a fee in respect of all timber or forest

produce exported from Sri Lanka, at the port of shipment, at

such rates, as are prescribed from time to time.

(2) This section shall be enforced as if it forms part of the

Custom Ordinance (Chapter 235) and the provisions of that

Ordinance shall apply accordingly.

1 Vide paragraph 39 of the written submissions.

The next argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is

the finished product of the petitioner made mainly of rubber

timber does not fall into the category of timber or forest

produce. According to the learned counsel In terms of the

Forest Ordinance, timber includes trees when they have fallen or

have been felled, and all wood.2 However I find that, this

definition is incomplete. According to section 78:

timber includes trees when they have fallen or have been

felled, and all wood, whether cut up or fashioned or

hollowed out for any purpose or not;

That means, even a finished product made out of wood, such as

the petitioners one, falls into the category of timber.

According to section 78, forest produce also, among other

things, includes timber.

I reject that argument.
