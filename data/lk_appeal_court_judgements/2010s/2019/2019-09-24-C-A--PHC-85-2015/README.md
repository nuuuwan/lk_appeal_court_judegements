The Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed action against the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in

terms of Section 28(A)(3), of the Urban Development Authority Law (as

amended), (Act) praying for an order for demolition of an unauthorized

construction by the Appellant. The learned Magistrate by order dated 17/06/20 II ,

dismissed the action of the Appellant on the basis that the present owner of the

building should be made a party and therefore, inter alia, directing that the case be

reinstituted against the present owner of the building, the husband of the

Appellant. The Respondent filed a Revision Application against the said order,

where the learned High Court Judge by Order dated 13/03/2015, held that the

Appellant is estopped from denying her ownership to the said building and

accordingly set aside the order of the learned Magistrate.

Page 2 of 10

The Appellant has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter alia, to set

aside the said Order dated 13/03/2015, given by the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo, which revised the Order of the learned

Magistrate of Colombo.

The main ground of appeal of the Appellant is that the principle of Res

Judicata will apply in this case since the cause of action between the parties are the

same. At page 154 of the brief, the learned High Court Judge in her order dated

13/0312015. held that the question of Res Judicata was not looked into since the

Court was not invited to do so.

The Appellant submits that the question of Res Judicata anses from a

previous action filed by the Respondent bearing No. 4922515, in the Magistrate's

Court of Colombo against the Appellant, where the learned High Court Judge has

set aside the order of the learned Magistrate, which was based on the same cause

of action between the same parties. However, as pointed out by the learned

Counsel for the Respondent, the learned Magistrate correctly decided that since

the case was not adjudicated on the merits of the case, Res Judicata would not

operate. "a decision, pronounced by a judicial tribunal having jurisdiction over

the cause and the parties, that disposes once and for all the mat/errs) so decided,

so that except on appeal it cannot be relitigated between the parties or their

privies" (Res Judicata, 4'" edition, (Spencer- Bower & Handley, 2009)

Page 3 of 10

The thrust of the doctrine is to prevent a party from re-litigating an issue or

a defence which has already been determined or which could have previously been

litigated.

[n Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. vs. Zodiac Seats UK Limited (2013) UKSC

46, a recent judgment on res judicata, Lord Sumption (with whom all members of

the Supreme Court agreed) identified six principles which make up the doctrine.

I. A party is prevented from bringing subsequent proceedings to challenge an

outcome that has already been decided (cause of action estoppel)

2. [f a claimant succeeds in the first action and does not appeal the outcome,

he may not bring a subsequent action on the same cause of action

3. The doctrine of merger treats a cause of action as having been extinguished

once judgment has been provided and accordingly, the claimant's only right

is the judgment itself

4. A party may not bring subsequent proceedings on an issue that has already

been determined (issue estoppel)

5. A party may not bring subsequent proceedings which should and could

have been dealt with in earlier proceedings

6. There is a general procedural rule against abusive proceedings.

In Stassen Exports Ltd. v. Lipton Ltd. And Another (2009) 2 SLR 172 at

page 186, Dr. Shira"i A. Bandarallayake J. (as she was then), stated that;

Page 4 of 10

"The constituent elements of res judicata estoppel is clearly described by

Spencer Bower (The Doctrine of Res Judicata, supra, pg. 10), where he has

stated thus;

"A party setting up res judicata by way of estoppel as bar to his

opponent's claim, or as the foundation of his own, must establish the

constituent elements, namely;

I. the decision was judicial in the relevant sense;

ii. it was in fact pronounced;

Ill. the tribunal had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject

matter;

IV. the decision was -

a) final and

b) on the merits;

v. it determined the same question as that raised In the later

litigation; and

VI. the parties to the later litigation were either parties to the earlier

litigation or their privies or the earlier decision was in rem"

Therefore, it is clear that the application of doctrine of Res Judicata is to

confer finality to a dispute, considering the merits of an action, where in the

present case it is evident that the Court has not gone into the merits of the case in

order to reach finality to the dispute between the parties. Accordingly, the doctrine

of Res Judicata will not apply in the instant case.

The Appellant also question's the authority to institute this action in terms

of Section 23(5) of the Act on the basis that the present owner of the premises is

her husband and not the Petitioner and therefore, action cannot be maintained

against the Appellant.

In terms of Section 28 A (3) (a) of the Act;

"(3) (a) Where any person has failed to comply with any requirement contained in

any written notice issued under subsection (1), any building or' work is not

demolished or altered within the time specified in the notice or within such

extended time as may have been granted by the Authority, the Authority

may apply to the Magistrate to make a mandatory order authorizing the

Authority to discontinue the use of any land or building demolish or alter

any building or work, to do all such other acts as such person was required

to do by such notice, as the case may be

and the Magistrate on serving notice on the person who had failed to comply with

the requirement of the Authority under Subsection (/) to demolish or alter

the building or work, may, if he is satisfied to the same effect, make order

accordingly. "

[n terms of Section 28 A (3) (a) of the UDA Act, any person who fails to

comply with any requirement contained in any written notice issued under

subsection (I) of Section 28A of the Act can be brought before Court. The

Respondent submits that the Appellant is the life interest holder of the said

property. and the transfer of the property has taken place in 200 l. However, the

Appellant has failed to raise the said objection even at the time when this

Page 6 of 10

application was pending before the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in 2004.

According to letter dated 20112/2002, at page 211 of the brief, the Appellant as the

life interest holder of the property has been aware of the unauthorized construction

at the time the ownership of the property was transferred to her husband.

Therefore, there is no basis for the Appellant to challenge the application against

her at this stage and hence, the objection raised is untenable.

Section 23 (5) of the Urban Development Authority Law as amended by

Act No.4 of 1982 provides as follows;

"(5) The Authoritv mav delegate to anv officer of a local authority in

consultation with that local authority, any of its powers, duties and

functions relating to planning, within any area declared to be a

development area under Section 3, and such officer shall exercise, perform

or discharge any such power, duty or functions so delegated, under the

direction, supervision and control of the Authority. "

The question whether the Mayor had any lawful authority to make an

application for a demolition order under the provisions of the Act was looked into

by this Court in CA (PHC) No. 2/97, where, Gamini Amaratunga J. cited with

approval the case of Piyasena Vs. Wijesooriya CA. Application 119/90- CA.

Minutes of 4/11/1994, where this Court held that "functions of planning would

include the taking of steps to enforce planning procedure" and was of the view

that "the delegation of the functions of planning would include the taking of steps

Page 7 of 10

to enforce planning procedure and accordingly the Mayor had the authority to

institute proceedings against an owner of an unauthorized building for an order to

demolish such building. "

In M. P. Selvam v. K.H. Perera (SC Appeal No. 123/09), the Court held that,

"The "Planning Procedure" is governed by the amending Act No. 4 of

1982. This Amending Act brought into force Section 28A as well which

deals with the "procedure to be followed in respect of certain development

activities commenced, continued, resumed or completed contrary to any

terms or conditiuns of a permit. The scope of Section 28A is therefore free

from obscurity that the legislature intended to secure compliance with the

development plan so that proper implementation of the said plan is carried

out. The "Planning Procedure " referred to in Part IIA in Section 8B

identifies mailers pertaining to the

I. Preparation;

II. Implementation and

iii. Enforcement of a development plan.

Hence, implementation of a development plan falls within the broad

caption of "Planning Procedure ". While Sections 8A -8H deal with the

manner in which a development plan has to be prepared, Section 8J makes

it clear that the purpose of issuing a permit is to ensure that all

development activities in development areas should conform to the

development plan.

Page 8 of 10

The provisions contained in Section 28A (3) fall within the scope of the

term "planning" and therefore the powers, duties and functions referred to

therein could be delegated by the UDA to any officer of a local authority. "

Therefore, the contention of the Appellants that the powers duties and

functions of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) could be delegated in

relation only to planning and not to the development activity does not hold ground.

Even though the Appellant contends that the order of demolition is related

to a development activity, the Appellant has failed to submit a permit issued by the

UDA authorizing the construction of the building ordered to be demolished. Part II

A of the Act provides that in terms of Section 80) of the Act, development activity

in any development area can be undertaken only under and in terms of a permit

issued by the UDA.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent has submitted the case of Urban

Development Authority vs. S. W. Kulasiri, CA No. 2226/2003, where it was held

that;

"In a situation where an application under Section 28 A (3) of UDA had

been made the relevant question is whether the structure in question has been

erected upon a valid permit. The existence of a permit is the only valid answer to

the application under Section 28 A (3). The burden of showing that the

construction had been on a valid permit is on the person noticed. "

Page 9 of 10

The unauthorized building is shown on the sketch marked P I at page 44 of

the brief. However, the Appellant has failed to produce a valid permit issued by

the Authority. The Appellant must prove that their construction is according to

law. Section 80) of the Amending Act has clearly stated that if any person is

carrying out or engaged in any development activity in any development area,

there must be a valid permit issued by the Authority.

F or all the above reasons, the judgment of the learned High Court Judge is

upheld and the application is dismissed.

Petition dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 20,0001-
