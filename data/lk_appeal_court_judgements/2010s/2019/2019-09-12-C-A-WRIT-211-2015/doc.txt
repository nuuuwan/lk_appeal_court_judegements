Decided on: 12.09.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash the order of

the Commander of the Army marked P6 whereby the petitioner

was discharged from service.

In P6 the Commander has enumerated several reasons why that

decision was taken for the greater benefit of the Sri Lanka Army.

The main reason is committing a criminal offence by getting

married to a Tamil lady posing himself as an unmarried man

whilst his lawful marriage is in existence. There are two boys

out of the lawful marriage and two girls out of the aforesaid

second marriage, which is a nullity in the eyes of the law. The

Tamil lady had filed a divorce action in the Mt. Lavinia District

Court, and it appears from P7 that the lawful wife has filed a

maintenance case against the petitioner seeking maintenance in

respect of the wife and the two children. In addition, it seems

from P7 that Colombo Fraud Bureau has also filed an action in

the Chief Magistrates Court against the petitioner on a criminal

charge wherein, I assume, upon pleading guilty and upon

conviction, the petitioner has been warned and discharged upon

payment of Rs. 100,000/= as compensation presumably to his

3

lawful wife. The Magistrate has acted under section 306 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Again, I assume, the charge is

the criminal offence of bigamy under section 362C of the Penal

Code where a person convicted shall be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extent

to ten years and shall be liable to fine.

I shall pause for a while to state that writ is a discretionary

remedy and therefore the petitioner when presenting facts to

Court shall act with uberrima fidesutmost good faith. He must

make full disclosure of facts material to the case. But the

petitioner in this case when producing P7 had been extremely

careful to tender only the parts of the legal proceedings which

are favourable to him. P7 consists of parts of two criminal

proceedings, but the Court is unaware what the real charges are

or the offences committed. It is also relevant to note that even in

the body the petition the petitioner does not disclose the

offences. That is a material fact for this Court in exercising writ

jurisdiction.

Suppression of material facts warrants dismissal of the writ

application in limine without going into the merits of the matter.

In the Supreme Court case of Namunukula Plantations Limited v.

Minister of Lands1 it was held that:

It is settled law that a person who approaches the Court for

grant of discretionary relief, to which category an

application for certiorari would undoubtedly belong, has to

4

come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all

the material facts which have any bearing on the

adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other

words, he owes a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima fides)

to the court to make a full and complete disclosure of all

material facts and refrain from concealing or suppressing

any material fact within his knowledge or which he could

have known by exercising diligence expected of a person of

ordinary prudence.

The Supreme Court2 further held that:

If any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a court

of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to

disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to

pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not only has the

right but a duty to deny relief to such person.

Paragraphs 46 and 47 of the petition read as follows.

46. The petitioner states that a case was filed in the

Magistrate Court of the Colombo by Fraud Bureau bearing

the number 24536/1 before the Hon Chief Magistrate of

Colombo and the said case had concluded with the Hon

Magistrate warning and discharging the petitioner under

section 306 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which

order was made after his wife the said Thushari Apsara

Modarage informed Court that she did not want to pursue

the matter any further or seek any other redress.

47. The petitioner states that the civil courts had found the

petitioner guilty of the above charges as framed against the

petitioner in the above case before the Magistrates Court of

Colombo and a penal order issued on the petitioner, and

therefore, that any further imposition of penal sanctions on

the petitioner is against the rule of Double Jeopardy

which recognizes that a person should not be punished

more than once for the same offence or wrong doing.

According to these two paragraphs, a case was filed in the

Magistrate Court of Colombo by Fraud Bureau and had found

the petitioner guilty of the above charges as framed against the

petitioner and a penal order issued on the petitioner. Hence

the petitioner says that he cannot be punished for the second

time by the Commander of the Army by discharging him from

service.

I cannot agree with that argument. If that argument is to

accepted, even after serving a custodial sentence for a grave

crime, the petitioner shall be allowed to continue to serve in the

Army.

What matters is not the sentence, but the fact of being found

guilty for a criminal offence.

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner is that a person subject to Military Law could only be

punished either consequent to a summary trial or a Court

Martial but not upon findings of a Court of Inquiry.

6

In this case, it is true that only a Court of Inquiry has been held.

But, according to the own admissions of the petitioner, he has

been found guilty for one or more of criminal offences and penal

sanctions have been imposed by Court of Law.

The petitioner was admittedly an officer of the Volunteer Force of

the Army.

A copy of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer

Reserve) Regulations 1985 made by the President under section

155 of the Army Act read with Article 44(2) of the Constitution

and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 476/26 dated

20.10.1987 has been marked as R9.

According to Regulation 11(7) thereof No person who has been

convicted of criminal offence shall be commissioned into a Regular

or Unit of the Volunteer Force. Notwithstanding it appears to be

applicable at the stage of recruitment, there is no reason why it

shall be inapplicable to an officer in service.

Regulation 62(3) states that:

On completion of the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry, the

Commanding Officer shall forward a copy of the

proceedings, together with his recommendations thereon,

through the usual military channels to the Commander of

the Army, who shall decide what further action should be

taken.

I do not say that the power so given to the Commissioner is

unfettered. He shall exercise that power on sound, time-tested

7

principles. That power is reviewable by this Court in a properly

constituted writ application.

It is my considered view that, in the facts and circumstances of

this case, the Commander of the Army has taken the correct

decision. That decision, in my view, is not arbitrary or

capricious. That decision has been taken on proved facts and

not on assumptions.

Unlike in any other institution, if there is no discipline in the

members of the Armed Forces including the Police Force, those

institutions cannot possibly run. Discipline shall be the top

priority in the Armed Forces. In short, if there is no discipline,

there is no Army, Navy or Air Force. This is equally true to the

Police Force.

I am fortified in this view inter alia by Article 15(8) of the

Constitution, which states:

The exercise and operation of the fundamental rights

declared and recognized by Articles 12(1), 13 and 14 shall,

in their application to the members of the Armed Forces,

Police Force and other Forces charged with the maintenance

of public order, be subject to such restrictions as may be

prescribed by law in the interests of the proper discharge of

their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.

Article 12(1) primarily deals with right to equality; Article 13

with freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment;

and Article 14 with freedom of speech, assembly, association,

occupation and movement.

Anil Gooneratne J. in Mangala Pushpakumara v. Air Chief

Marshal Roshan Gunathilake (CA/WRIT/448/2009) decided on

28.3.2013, held that such discharge from service is not made as

a punishment and therefore does not violate the doctrine of

double jeopardy.

Punishments have been given to the petitioner separately for

separate offences by Civil Courts. This discharge from service is

to maintain discipline for the greater benefit of the Army.

This Court cannot and shall not interfere with the internal

administrative decisions of the Armed Forces unless there are

cogent compelling reasons to do so. There are no such

circumstances in this case.

For the aforesaid reasons, I proceed to dismiss the application,

which I do without costs.
