M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) above

named instituted the aforesaid partition action by a Plaint dated 13.10.1980

to partition the land called Kahatagawatte which had been described in the

schedule to the said Plaint as having an extent of 2A-3R-0P.

The corpus sought to be partitioned in the above action was depicted in terms

of Preliminary Plan No. 2528 dated 01.09.1981 and 04.12.1981 made by U.M.

De Silva, Licensed Surveyor produced marked as X and the report annexed

to the said Plan had been produced marked as X1 (page 269 of the appeal

brief). In terms of the said Preliminary Plan X, the corpus sought to be

partitioned in the action had been depicted as Lots A to F in the said Plan

having a total extent of 2A-2R-18.72P.

The 11th Defendant-Appellant distinctly filed his Statement of Claim dated

25.05.1992 (vide page 234 of the appeal brief), wherein he sought an

exclusion of the premises described in schedules A and B of his Statement of

Claim from the corpus sought to be partitioned in this action, on the basis that

the said premises were not co-owned, that he and his predecessors in title

had independently possessed the said premises as a divided entity from the

time it was vested in the Urban Council of Kaluthara for non-payment of rates

in terms of the Certificates of Purchase Nos. 11 and 12 (marked as 11V9 and

11V8 respectively) dated 27.05.1932 in respect of premises bearing

assessment Nos. 50 and 51 Jeddah Street, Kaluthara presently bearing

assessment Nos. 129 and 131 Marikkar Street, Kaluthara.

4

In spite of the said Sale to the Municipal Council, the 11th Defendant-Appellant

in the said Statement of Claim, further pleaded that he and his predecessors in

title had possessed the said premises described in the said schedules A and B

of his Statement of Claim as separate divided lot independently undisturbed

and uninterrupted for over a period of 10 years, therefore, he claimed to have

possessed the said land and premises and acquired prescriptive title to the

same.

According to above contentions, in the District Court, the 11th Defendant-

Appellant prayed for the issue of a commission to depict the lands described

as A and B in the Schedule to the said Statement of Claim in terms of Plan, to

exclude the said land from the corpus sought to be partitioned in the action,

and dismissal of Plaintiff-Respondents action.

Thereafter, the District Court on the above application of the 11th Defendant-

Appellant issued commission to depict in terms of a Plan the lands that had

been described in schedules A and B of the 11th Defendant-Appellants

Statement of Claim. The Commissioner (B. K. P. W.Gunawardena) had

executed his commission by submitting to Court Plan No. 468 dated

06.08.1992 (marked as 11V4 at page 280 of the appeal brief) and the report

annexed to the said Plan (marked as 11V5 at page 292) wherein he had

depicted the said separate land as Lot E2 in his Plan by superimposing the

premises depicted in Plan No. 451. It is seen from the record that the said Lot

E2 of Plan No. 451 dated 07.08.1958 made by Stanly N. D. Silva, Licensed

Surveyor and in Plan No. 786 dated 30.01.1968 made by U. M. De Silva,

Licensed Surveyor and described in the schedules to Deed No. 1009 (11V15),

Deed No. 2976 (11V19) and Deed No. 3441 (11V20).

When this matter came up for trial, the 11th Defendant-Appellant did not

accept the corpus sought to partitioned in this action as depicted in

Preliminary Plan No. 2528 X made by U. M. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor.

The contention of the 7th, 8th and 10th Defendant-Respondents were filed

Statement of Claim dated 22.09.1983 and averred that they were entitled to

half of the interest of the land and premises in suit.

After conclusion of the trial the learned Additional District Judge delivered his

judgment on 03.10.1996 with the Plaintiff-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the

judgment dated 03.10.1996, this appeal preferred by the 11th Defendant-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) to set aside the said

judgment of the learned District judge, and direct that Lot E2 in Plan No. 468-

11V4 be excluded from the corpus sought to be partitioned in this action and

for costs.

Having heard the parties in this case, it is clear that the Appellant has claimed

his rights mainly by way of prescription. It is well known accustomed rule that

the prescriptive title can be claimed only in respect of well-defined definite

boundaries. Therefore, it was the main contention of the Plaintiff-Respondent

that at the time of the Preliminary Plan X was made, there were no

boundaries demarcating what the Appellant claimed.

After careful perusal of the Certificates of Sale Nos. 11 (11V9) and 12 (11V8)

dated 27.05.1932, it is clear that the schedules of these certificates have not

been identified in Plan 11V4 which was made by the Court Commissioner on

the application of the Appellant by direction of the Court.

6

Further, it is seen from the records, the said Surveyor, B. K. P.

W.Gunawardena in his evidence admitted that the Northern, Eastern and

Southern boundaries of Lot E2 had not been clearly identified (vide page 375

of the appeal brief). Therefore, the learned Additional District Judge correctly

has taken the position that according to above said evidence he cannot

exclude E2 depicted in Plan 11V4 from the corpus of the land sought to be

partitioned.

In DE SILVA vs. COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF INLAND REVENUE [80 NLR 292],

Sharvananda, J. clearly and deeply observed that,

The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the

possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The

acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the

rights of the true owner; the person in possession must claim to

be so as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no

hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can be no

adverse possession... (Emphasized added).

In SIRAJUDEEN AND TWO OTHERS vs. ABBAS [(1994) 2 SLR 365], G. P. S. De

Silva, C. J. held that,

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

7

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is

necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and

the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court.

Therefore, in the above mentioned lacunas in the claims of the appellant, I

hold that the prescriptive title of the Appellant cannot be stand.

The learned Additional District Judge in his judgment had analyzed the

evidence of the parties and correctly held that Lot E2 cannot be excluded from

the corpus sought to be partitioned in this action.

In these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment. Hence, I dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
