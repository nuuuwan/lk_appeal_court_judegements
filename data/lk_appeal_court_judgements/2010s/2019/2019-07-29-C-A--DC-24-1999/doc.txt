'The original Plaintiff one S.M. Ukkuhamy filed this partition suit in order to partition 1 the land described in the 1st schedule to the plaint as Galgodewatta and the contiguous

land described in the 2nd Schedule as Galgodahena, both being demarcated in Final Village

Plans as Lots 64 and 65 respectively. In the amended plaint dated 30th June 1985, the

Plaintiff pleaded a pedigree and sought to partition the aforesaid contiguous lands among

her and the 1st to 5th Defendants in terms of the share allotment given in paragraph 7 of the

amended plaint. She cited 12 Defendants in the amended plaint but sought partition to

take place only among herself and 1st to 5th Defendants.

The 6th Defendant'S Statement of Claim

The 6th Defendant Punchi Menika put forward her claim to Lot 64 (Lot 1 in the

preliminary plan) before the surveyor who went to perform the preliminary survey. The

surveyor confirms her presence on Lot 1 in his report. Admitting that the land had

originally belonged to one S.M. Bandaappuhamy and S.M. Mudalihamy, the 6th Defendant

pleaded that S.M. Mudalihamy had been exclusively possessing only Lot 65 and since

1932, the 6th Defendant Punchi Menika had been in possession of Lot 64 (Lot 1 in the

preliminary plan). The claim of the 6th Defendant had been one of prescription

accompanied by undisturbed and uninterrupted possession. The possession of Lot 64 (Lot

1) had been continuing even at the time of the institution of this action and as I said before,

the surveyor confirms this in his report. Punchi Menika (the 6th Defendant) had built a

house on Lot 1 and planted trees thereon. The Lot in her possession--Lot 1 had been

separated from Lot 2 by a live wire fence. By virtue of her long possession and prescriptive

6

rights, the 6th Defendant sought an exclusion of Lot 1 from the corpus. Alternatively the 6th

Defendant sought a declaration of ownership to Lot 1 if Lot 1 is included in the corpus and

claimed the house and the plantation thereon. Prior to the commencement of the trial, the

6th Defendant passed away and the 6A Defendant ... Respondent was substituted.

Substituted 2A and lOA Defendant ... Appellant

It has to be stated at the inception that the 2nd Defendant was one Adhikari

Mudiyanselage Kirimudiyanse who was substituted with her daughter Adhikari

Mudiyanselage Dingiri Amma (substituted 2A Defendant ... Appellant). It has to be borne in

mind that the Substituted 2A and lOA Defendant ... Appellant is one and the same person ...

Adhikari Mudiyanselage Dingiri Amma.

It is crystal clear that the 2A Defendant and lOA Defendant ... Appellant (the one and the

same person) had not filed a statement of claim in the case but her father Adhikari

Mudiyanselage Kirimudiyanse (the 2nd Defendant) had been allotted the 1/4th share by the

Plaintiff in the plaint. Even in the amended plaint the Plaintiff showed share allotments

only up to the 5th Defendant, whilst the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, lOth, 11th and 12th Defendants were

not given any shares at all in the amended plaint. The share allotments up to the 5th

Defendant in the plaint went as follows: ...

Plaintiff 1/8

1st Defendant 1/4 2nd Defendant 1/4 3rd Defendant 1/8

4 th Defendant 1/8

5th Defendant 1/8

In fact one S.E. Thennakoon the lOth Defendant who was the predecessor in title of lOA

Defendant ... Adhikari Mudiyanselage Dingiri Amma claimed before the surveyor that he had

derived his interests from the 1st Defendant. Before I deal with the case of the Appellant

namely Adhikari Mudiyanselage Dingiri Amma, let me first deal with the claim of the 6th

Defendant which was to the effect that Lot 1 must be excluded from the corpus. The four

7

issues that had been raised on behalf of the 6th Defendant Punchi Menika had put in issue

the question of exclusion of Lot 1.

Whilst giving evidence at the trial, the substituted Plaintiff (the husband of the original

Plaintiff) admitted in examination in chief that the house standing on Lot 1 was in the

occupation of the 6th Defendant who also enjoyed the cultivation therein. The substituted

Plaintiff expressly admitted that the house and cultivation in Lot 1 belonged to the 6th

Defendant. The 2A and lOA Defendant (one and the same person Dingiri Amma) also gave

evidence to the effect that the house and cultivation in Lot 1 belonged to the 6th Defendant.

These two admissions emanating from the substituted Plaintiff and the 2A and lOA

Defendant-Appellant would amount to statements against their proprietary interest and

the distinctive aspect of these statements against proprietary interest was that it was an

intra curial statement made in Court. Thus the Court could act on these statements on the

basis that they are true.

The 6A Defendant too testified in order to bolster his claim that Lot 1 has to be excluded.

There was also another witness Irene Somawathie who supported the testimony of 6A

Defendant. Both testified that Lot 1 and the house in Lot 1 had been in the occupation of

the 6th Defendant and later the 6A Defendant for more than 30 years.

In addition to these items of evidence there was the testimony of 2A and lOA Defendant

(Dingiri Amma) to the effect that Punchi Menika (the 6th Defendant) had been living in

Lot 1 and that Dingiri Amma would not claim any interest in Lot 1. Thus it is evident that

the evidence for exclusion of Lot 1 in favour of 6A Defendant was overwhelming.

Upon a totality of the evidence in the case, the learned Additional District Judge of

Kuliyapitiya arrived at the conclusion that Lot 1 of the preliminary plan bearing No.763

must be excluded and I see no reason to disturb that finding.

As for the claim of the 2A Defendant-Appellant it was contended by Mr. M.C. Jayaratne

that even though the 2A Defendant-Appellant had not filed a statement of claim, she gave

evidence at the trial and produced deeds in order to establish the fact that she had 1/2 share

in the land sought to be partitioned. She had not raised any points of contest but had been

8

represented right throughout the trial by counsel. She was summoned to give evidence and

nobody had objected to 2A Defendant--Appellant testifying in court though there was no

statement of claim nor were there any points of contest raised on her behalf.

Her half a share in the land was quite convincingly established by the adduction of deeds

marked as 12Vl, 12V2 and 12V3. A 1/4th share had devolved on her from her father, whilst

the other 1I4th share devolved on her from her mother. It was established that one half of

the subject--matter had devolved on her with the house in Lot 2.

The learned Additional District Judge of Kuliyapitya took into account the fact that 2A

Defendant--Appellant had not filed a statement of claim nor was there any point of contest

on the record. The learned Additional District Judge took the view that now that Lot 1 had

been excluded, one half of Lot 2 along with the house must be kept unallotted and ordered

the balance one half of Lot 2 to be partitioned among the Plaintiff, 3rd, 4th, 5t\ 8th and 9th

Defendants. Having gone through the share allotment made by the learned Additional

District Judge, I take the view that he arrived at the right decision but as for his decision to

keep unallotted one half of Lot 2, I take a different view.

No doubt 2A Defendant--Appellant is debarred from filing a statement of claim without the

leave of court and Section 25(2) of Partition Law No.21 of 1977 reiterates that a party in

default shall not be entitled, without the leave of court, raise any contest or dispute the

claim of any other party to the action at the trial.

It would appear that this provision had not been borne in mind by any of the parties and

even at the hearing before me no contention was raised as to the invalidity or otherwise of

the proceedings that took place. Nobody argued that when 2A Defendant--Appellant

placed her evidence before the learned Additional District Judge asserting her right to one

half of the corpus, it was an improper reception of evidence. Needless to say, the deeds

produced by the 2A Defendant--Appellant established her interest and right in one half of

the property but this documentary evidence came up on the record with the leave of the

learned Additional District Judge though the leave was implied. I do not see any adverse

interest to this one half and no party has been substantially prejudiced.

. ..

Section 167 of the Evidence Ordinance enacts: The improper admission or rejection of

evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decisions in any case,

if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is raised that independently of

the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the

decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the

decision.

Section 167 is applicable to both civil as well as criminal cases. This section deals with two

important aspects of the admission and rejection of evidence in proceedings, namely, 1)

evidence that should not be admitted if it is improperly admitted, and 2) evidence that is to

be admitted is improperly rejected. The object of the section is that the Court of Appeal, in

appeal or in revision, should not disturb a decision of a lower court on the ground of

improper admission or rejection of evidence, if in spite of such reception, there is sufficient

material in the case to justify the decision.

In my view there cannot be multiplicity of suits or proceedings and if the decision to keep

the shares un allotted is allowed to remain, it will only add to the woes of the 2A

Defendant and lead to protracted proceedings. The appeal before me is not a case which

throws up the same issues as were, encountered in the case of David Dantanarayana v.

Nonahamy 79 (2) N.L.R 241. In that case it was held that a practice has evolved in our

Courts for allotting unallotted shares on proof of title even after interlocutory decree has

been entered. In contrast, in this case there is clear proof of title long before interlocutory

decree and the party claiming title to such an unallotted share has already given evidence

in proof of her title. There had been an implied grant of leave on the part of the learned

Additional District Judge to the adduction of evidence and it is bound to wreak injustice if

this Court denies 2A Defendant the one half share merely because there were no points of

contest or a statement of claim. The testimony led with the permission of court had

supplied the omission with no objection having been raised to the adduction of evidence.

In any event Section 167 of the Evidence Ordinance validates the evidence for the Court to

take it into account and the Court itself had arrived at its findings on the evidence. The

trial Court has acted on the evidence.

10

No objection was raised to the maintainability of this appeal on the basis that the 2A

Defendant has suffered only damnum absque injuria or damnum sine injuria/Damage without

wrongful act--Loss or harm that is incurred from something other than a wrongful act-- a

usual argument that is taken to show that the Appellant is not an aggrieved party because

he had not complained by way of a statement of claim--see Dheeraratne, J. in Mendis v.

Dublin de Silva and two others (1990) 2 Sri L.R 249.

The truth is to the contrary in this case and I take the view that whilst affirming that part

of the judgement dated 24.11.1998 excluding Lot 1 in favour of 6A Defendant--Respondent, I

proceed to set aside the other part of the judgment that keeps the one half unallotted.

Accordingly I would allow the appeal of the 2A Defendant--Appellant and direct the

learned District Judge of Kuliyapitya to enter the interlocutory decree in the following

manner:--

1. Lot 1 of the preliminary plan bearing No.763 must be excluded in favour of the 6A

Defendant--Respondent.

2. One half of Lot 2 with the house therein must be allotted to the 2A Defendant--

Appellant.

3. The balance one half of Lot 2 has to be allotted among the Plaintiff, 3rd, 4th, 5th. 8th

and 9th Defendants (1/12 share each).
