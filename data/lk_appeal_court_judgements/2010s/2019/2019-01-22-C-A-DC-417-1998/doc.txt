Respondents.

Decided on: 18.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the two defendants seeking

declaration of title to the land described in the 2nd schedule to

the plaint, ejectment of the defendants therefrom and damages.

The defendants sought dismissal of the plaintiffs action and also

made several contradictory claims in reconvention including (a)

a declaration that the plaintiff is holding the property in trust for

the defendants and (b) the defendants have acquired prescriptive

title to the land. After trial the learned District Judge dismissed

the plaintiffs action and entered Judgment for the defendants

on the basis that the defendants have prescribed to the land.

Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.

3

It shall be emphasized that the defendants did not file a cross

appeal against the Judgment. Nor did they file objections in

terms of section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code before the

hearing. They have filed purported objections after argument

was concluded,1 which is clearly an afterthought.

By way of a formal admission, the defendants have admitted

that the plaintiff became the absolute owner of the land by Deed

marked P1.2

It is the position of the defendants that they paid the full

purchase price in a sum of Rs.47,000/= to buy the land from

the plaintiff, but the plaintiff did not transfer the land in their

name. It is on that basis they state that the plaintiff is holding

the land in trust for them. The learned District Judge has

rejected this claim.

The 1st defendant is the brother in law of the plaintiff3, and the

2nd defendant is the wife of the former. The learned Judge has

come to the finding that the defendants came into the land with

the leave and licence of the plaintiff. Having come to that

conclusion, quite surprisingly, the learned Judge states that

from the date on which they came into possession of the land,

they have started prescriptive possession against the plaintiff.4

The latter conclusion is plainly untenable in law. If they have

come as licensees, how can they maintain adverse possession

from day one?

Permissive possession, however long it may be, is not

prescriptive possession. Permissive possession to become

adverse possession to claim prescriptive possession, there shall

be compelling cogent evidence. In that setting, firstly, the

defendants must establish a starting point for their acquisition

of prescriptive rights. The defendants are not entitled to do so

by forming a secret intention unaccompanied by an act of

ouster.5

When the relationship between the two parties is so close such

as in the instant action, the overt act manifesting the

commencement of adverse possession and strong affirmative

evidence to establish continuance of adverse possession are all

the more important.6

The defendants have not proved when they started adverse

possession against the plaintiff, which is a sine qua non for a

successful claim of prescription.

When one looks at the answer it is clear that the defendants

have not put forward the prescriptive claim with seriousness.

What they seek is a declaration that the 1st defendant and or the

2nd defendant has or have acquired prescriptive title to the land.7

They are not certain in favour of whom the prescriptive title shall

be claimed. Further, they claim prescription by a title adverse

to or independent of that of the plaintiff for a period of more than

ten years previous to the date of action.8 Be it noted that the

defendants claim to have maintained adverse possession only

against the plaintiff (and not against the plaintiff and his

predecessors in title). Admittedly, the plaintiff became the

owner by Deed P1 dated 21.03.1985, and the action has been

filed on 22.02.1995. That means, even if the defendants have

maintained adverse possession against the plaintiff from

21.03.1985, the defendants have not had adverse possession for

ten years prior to the institution of the action.

The defendants both before the District Court and before this

Court deny that they were licensees of the plaintiff. If that is so,

the defendants should not have been allowed to raise an issue,

be it noted, after the conclusion of the trial9 that the plaintiffs

action is not maintainable as the licence given to the defendants

has not been terminated.

It is settled law that a party cannot be inconsistent in his

approach in legal proceedings. He cannot blow hot and cold,

affirm and disaffirm the same transaction simultaneously to suit

the occasion. The doctrine of approbate and reprobate forbids

him from doing so.10 Whilst holding that the defendants have

prescribed to the land, I fail to understand how the learned

District Judge has also held that the plaintiff cannot maintain

this action as the licence given to the defendants have not been

terminated.11

The positions taken up not only by the defendants but also by

the learned District Judge are contradictory.

As I stated earlier, the paper title of the plaintiff has been

admitted by the defendants by way of a formal admission.

It was held by Sharvananda C.J. in Theivandran v. Ramanathan

Chettiar12 that:

In a vindicatory action the claimant need merely prove two

facts; namely, that he is the owner of the thing and that the

thing to which he is entitled to possession by virtue of his

ownership is in the possession of the defendant. Basing his

claim on his ownership, which entities him to possession,

he may sue for the ejectment of any person in possession of

it without his consent. Hence, when the legal title to the

premises is admitted or proved to be in the plaintiff, the

burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he is

lawful possession.

The same position was reiterated in a long line of decisions

including Beebi Johara v. Warusavitharana13, Candappa nee

Bastian v. Ponnambalam Pillai14, Wijetunge v. Thangarajah15.

It is my considered view that the defendants have not discharged

that burden.

I unhesitatingly set aside the Judgment of the learned District

Judge and allow the appeal with costs both here and the Court

below.

Let the present District Judge enter Judgment as prayed for in

the prayer to the plaint.
