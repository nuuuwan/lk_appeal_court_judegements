Decided on: 22.11.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the original 1st and 2nd respondents

seeking to set aside:

a) The order of the Magistrates Court dated 31.01.2013

b) The order of the Magistrates Court dated 16.09.2013

c) The order of the High Court dated 25.09.2014

The police reported facts to the Magistrates Court seeking an

order under section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to

immediately prevent a tense situation arising from some alleged

unbefitting conduct of the appellant Buddhist monks living in a

religious place in a State land.

After giving a hearing to all the parties, the Magistrates Court by

order dated 31.01.2013, inter alia, directed the appellants to

hand over possession of the place to the Divisional Secretary

and vacate the place; and then the Divisional Secretary was

directed to hand over possession of the place to a suitable party.

In compliance with that order, the appellants handed over

possession of the place to the Divisional Secretary and vacated

3

the place; and the Divisional Secretary took steps to hand over

the place to a suitable party.1

The revision application filed in the High Court by the appellants

against the said order of the Magistrates Court was withdrawn

unconditionally, and the High Court accordingly dismissed the

said application on 25.06.2013 without reserving the right to file

a fresh application.2

Thereafter the appellants made an application to the

Magistrates Court to restore them in possession by exercising

inherent powers of the Court as the order of the Magistrates

Court dated 31.01.2013 is ex facie bad in law, in that, the

Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction (a) to make an order in

terms of section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to be

operative for a period more than 14 days and (b) to direct the

Divisional Secretary to hand over the place to a suitable party.3

This application of the appellants to restore them in possession

was rejected by the Magistrates Court by order dated

16.09.2013 inter alia on the premise that the Divisional

Secretary had already taken steps in accordance with the earlier

order of the Magistrates Court, and the Court cannot put the

appellants back in possession in violation of the said order,

which would again cause breach of the peace.

The revision application filed against this second order of the

Magistrates Court was dismissed by the High Court by order

dated 25.09.2014.

1 Vide documents (April and May 2013) at pages 475-481 of the brief for the latter. 2 Vide page 466 of the brief. 3 Vide, in particular, pages 13-14 of the written submissions of the appellant dated 30.07.2019.

4

I think I do not need to give so many reasons to dismiss this

appeal.

Once the appellants withdrew the revision application filed

against the first order of the Magistrates Court dated

31.01.2013, they cannot canvass the same order in a

subsequent application. That is exactly what the appellants did

when they made the application to restore them in possession

on the basis that the first order was ex facie wrong. If the first

order was ex facie wrong, they should not have withdrawn the

revision application filed against it.

In my view, having withdrawn the revision application filed

against the first order of the Magistrates Court, the second

application made by the appellants to restore them in

possession on the basis that the first order is ex facie erroneous,

is misconceived in law.

The order of refusal of the Magistrates Court to restore the

appellants in possession, and the order of the High Court which

affirmed it are correct.

I dismiss the appeal with costs.
