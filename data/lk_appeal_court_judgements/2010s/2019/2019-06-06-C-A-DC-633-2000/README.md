Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District judge of Kuliyapitiya dated

19.09.2000.

The Plaintiff instituted the above styled action to partition the land morefuliy described in the

schedule to the plaint One Acre extent. The 5th and 7th Defendants sought a dismissal of the

action or in the alternative to partition only Lots 2 and 3 morefully described in the preliminary

plan no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] and Lot 1 therein to be excluded. The other parties

did not dispute either the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff or the identity of the corpus.

It is trite law in partition actions that the trial judge is under a "supervening duty to satisfy itself

as to the identity of the corpus" [Wickremaratne v. A/penis Perera [1986] 1 Sri. L.R. 190 at 199]

as "clarity in regard to the identity of the corpus is fundamental to the investigation of title in a

partition case." [Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi and two others (2010) 1 Sri.L.R. 87 at 106]

Page 4 of G

Since the Plaintiff and the 5th and 7th Defendants were disputing the identity of the corpus it was

incumbent on the learned Judge to clearly identify the corpus sought to be partitioned. The

identity of the corpus assumes greater importance on the facts as the preliminary survey report

of the surveyor indicates that he was not in a position to state clearly to court whether the land

surveyed is the land sought to be partitioned [Appeal Brief page 270]

However, this is a result of two divergent positions taken by the Plaintiff and the 5th and 7th

Defendants during the preliminary survey where the Plaintiff pointed out Lots 1 and 2 of

preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] as the corpus in the partition action

whereas the 5th and 7th Defendants pointed out Lots 2 and 3 therein as the corpus in the partition

action.

However, during the trial, the SA and 7A Defendants agreed to exclude Lot 3 of preliminary plan

no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] from the corpus sought to be partitioned [Appeal brief

page 177]. Hence the remaining issue was whether Lot 1 of preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87

[Appeal Brief page 268] should be partitioned along with Lot 2 therein.

The preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] identifies the corpus as

Paranawatta. The position taken up in the statement of claim by the 5th and 7th Defendants is

that Lot 1 of preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] is called

Ambagahamulawatta and is not part of Paranawatta.

The SA and 7A Defendants rely on deeds no. 3494 (Sll) and 43905 (Sl2) [Appeal Brief pages

258-263] to prove their title. However, the lands referred to therein are Ambagahamulawatta

and Halambagahakumbura and they have failed to take out a commission to prove that these

two lands are part of the corpus in the partition action.

The learned District Judge has carefully considered the evidence led and correctly concluded that

Lot 1 of preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] is part of Paranawatta. In

particular the learned Judge has accepted the evidence of the p t Defendant that although there

were three lines of barbed wire on the western boundary of Lot 1 of preliminary plan No.

113/kuli/87 [Appeal Brief page 268] previously they were not there when the preliminary survey

was done. The learned judge has concluded that Lot 1 of the preliminary plan no. 113/kuli/87

[Appeal Brief page 268] is part of Paranawatta.

I have given careful consideration to the evidence led in this matter and the conclusions thereon

of the learned District Judge. I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

District judge of Kuliyapitiya dated 19.09.2000.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
