*************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"Appellant") invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set

aside an order of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo dated 30.04.2014. With the pronouncement of the said

order in case No. HCRA 183/2011, the Provincial High Court has

dismissed the Appellant's application to revise the issuance of writ of

possession by the Magistrate's Court of Mt. Lavinia in case No.5475 /S/ll.

Case No. 5475/S/11 of the Magistrate's Court of Mt. Lavinia refers to

an application made by the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") under Section 6(1) of the

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act), to recover possession of a

2

unit of Government quarters that had been placed under the control of

Irrigation Department, situated at No. 77/ A, Irrigation Housing Complex,

Ratmalana.

The Appellant has been transferred out of the Irrigation Department

under which he was permitted to occupy the said unit of the Government

Quarters. His agreement to occupy the quarters too had passed its terminal

date. The Respondent thereupon issued a notice dated 07.02.2011 on the

Appellant to handover vacant possession of said quarter he occupies, on or

before 08.04.2011. Upon his failure to hand over vacant possession of the

said quarters on the due date, the Respondent moved Court seeking writ

of possession.

The Magistrate's Court has issued writ of possession on 25.11. 2011

under Section 7(1) of the Act, upon the said application by the Respondent.

It appears that the Magistrate's Court has issued notice on the

Appellant and upon his request, afforded an opportunity for him to raise

"preliminary objections" for the application of the Respondent. In the said

"preliminary objections" the Appellant challenged the competency of the

Respondent to make an application before the Magistrate's Court seeking

his ejectment. However, the Magistrate's Court, having rejected his

challenge to the standing of the Respondent as the Competent Authority,

issued the writ of possession by its order on 25.11.2011.

3

At that stage the Appellant has invoked revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court seeking to challenge the validity of the issuance

of writ of possession. In dismissing the Appellant's application for

revision, the Provincial High Court has held that there was no illegality in

the issuance of writ of possession by the Magistrate's Court. It also held

that the Respondent is the Competent Authority who could move for the

issuance of writ of possession against the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said order of dismissal the Appellant sought

intervention of this Court.

The Appellant was represented before this Court on 15.03.2018,

upon being noticed and his appeal was fixed for hearing on 13.09.2018. He

has obtained his copy of the appeal brief on 31.05.2018. Thereafter, the

Appellant was represented when his appeal was taken up for hearing on

13.09.2018. On 13.09.2018 parties moved Court to pronounce its judgment

on the written submissions and they were afforded an opportunity to

tender the same on or before 01.11.2018. Judgment was to be pronounced

on 16.11.2018. On that day the judgment could not be pronounced due to

the failure of both parties to tender their submissions. However they

reiterated their desire to have a judgment pronounced on the written

submissions. Accordingly, they were given yet another opportunity to

tender submissions on or before 08.03.2019, after re-fixing judgment for

today. However, the Appellant, displayed his lack of interest to prosecute

4

this appeal, by the repeated non compliance of the direction to tender

written submissions.

In spite of the continuation conduct of the Appellant, this Court

would nevertheless consider his appeal.

Perusal of his petition of appeal reveals that he sought to challenge

the validity of the order of the Provincial High Court in its failure to

consider the Respondent's competency as the Competent Authority to seek

his eviction.

When an application for ejectment is made under Section 7(1) of the

Act against an 1/ occupier" of any Government quarters, a Magistrate must

issue a writ of possession. The Magistrate's Court was not conferred with a

discretion by the said section to consider any ground other than what is

stated in the application. Whether the Respondent is the Competent

Authority or not could not be decided by the Magistrate's Court in view of

the statutory provisions contained in Section 6(1)(a)(i) and Section 6(4) of

the said Act. Section 6(4) is clear as it states that 1/ Every application for

ejectment shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein." Therefore,

when the Respondent stated that he is the Competent Authority in the

application seeking a writ of possession against the present Appellant, the

Magistrate's Court has no power to allow the Appellant, who was the

Respondent before it, to contest that fact.

In these circumstances, when the Provincial High Court examines

the validity of the issuance of a writ of possession by a Magistrate's Court,

there was no basis for it to hold such an order as illegal or improper. If the 5

issuance of writ of possession is not tainted with any error on law, then

there was no justification for the Provincial High Court to interfere with

the issuance of writ of possession. The other ground stated by the

Appellant in his petition regarding a Government policy are relevant

considerations if he sought judicial review of the quit notice before a

competent Court. In Dayananda v Thalwatte (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 73, it was

held that revisionary jurisdiction cannot be combined with writ

jurisdiction of this Court.

Therefore, it is our considered view that the appeal of the Appellant

is devoid of any merit and accordingly it ought to be dismissed.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000.00.
