for the Respondent.

Argued on: 03.12.2019

Decided on: 20.12.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an application initially filed before the Magistrates Court

of Kegalle, under section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, No.44 of 1979, by the petitioner-respondent-

respondent (hereinafter the respondent) against the

respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter the appellant),

seeking restoration of possession to the land in dispute, on the

basis that the respondent was forcibly dispossessed by the

appellant within a period of two months immediately before the

filing of the application. The appellant took up the position that

there was no forcible dispossession. After inquiry, the

Magistrates Court, by order dated 13.03.2015, held with the

respondent. This decision was affirmed by the High Court of

Kegalle by the Judgment dated 26.04.2018. This appeal by the

appellant is against the Judgment of the High Court.

The facts leading to this appeal are briefly as follows:

Karunaratne Liyanage was the original owner of the land in

dispute. He sold it to the respondent. The respondent sold it to

Milton Silva but retained possession as Milton Silva was abroad.

In the meantime, Karunaratna Liyanage filed a case in the

District Court (7732/L) against the respondent, on the basis

that he was the owner of the land and the respondent was

holding it in trust for him. Pending determination of the case,

Karunaratne Liyanage obtained an interim injunction whereby

the respondent was dispossessed from the land. After

Karunaratne Liyanage obtained possession of the land by way of

the said interim injunction, he withdrew the case.

The respondent filed a revision application in the High Court of

Civil Appeal of Kegalle (28/2010/Rev), seeking to restore him to

possession of the land after the withdrawal of the District Court

action by Karunaratne Liyanage. This was allowed by the High

Court of Civil Appeal. The application of the appellant to

intervene in that revision application was refused.

The Supreme Court by Judgment dated 12.11.2013 (in case No.

SC Appeal 98/2011) affirmed the Judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeal.

Thereafter, as seen from the Fiscal Report (at pages 275-279 in

the Brief), on 16.07.2014, in the execution of the writ, the Fiscal

of the District Court of Kegalle removed the agents of

Karunaratne Liyanage from the land and handed over

possession to the respondent.

According to the respondent, the appellant (as the agent of

Milton Silva) forcibly dispossessed the respondent the next day,

i.e. 17.07.2014.

Website Copy Website Copy

The respondent made a lengthy complaint to the police on

18.07.2014 setting out the history of the case.

It is the position of the appellant that there was no forcible

dispossession, but the respondent voluntarily handed over

possession to the appellant as the Power of Attorney holder of

Milton Silva.

This position of the appellant has been rightly rejected both by

the Magistrates Court and the High Court.

There is no evidence to prove that the respondent peacefully

handed over possession to the appellant except the ipse dixit of

the respondent himself.

If possession was voluntarily handed over by the respondent to

the appellant on 17.07.2014, there was no reason for the former

to make a complaint to the police on 18.07.2014 alleging forceful

dispossession.

It is significant to note the appellant unsuccessfully attempted

to intervene in the revision application filed by the respondent in

the High Court seeking restoration of possession. The

intervention was sought by the appellant in order to have

possession delivered to him as the Power of Attorney holder of

Milton Silva.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is difficult to

believe that having obtained possession through a protracted

legal battle, the respondent voluntarily handed it over to the

appellant.

The learned counsel for the appellant has challenged the order

of the Magistrates Court and the Judgment of the High Court on

three grounds. Let me now consider them one by one.

The first submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is

that the learned Magistrate did not have jurisdiction to make the

impugned order, as there was no threat or apprehension to a

breach of the peace.

The learned counsel, drawing attention to the Judgment of this

Court in Velupillai v. Sivanathan [1993] 1 Sri LR 123, states that

when the information is filed by a party to the dispute such as in

this case, as opposed to it being filed by the police, the

Magistrate shall exercise a higher degree of caution in deciding

to proceed with the matter.

In this case, when the appellant appeared before the

Magistrates Court in response to summons, the appellant took

up a preliminary objection that the Court had no jurisdiction to

proceed with the matter as there was no likelihood of the breach

of the peace. After inquiry, by order dated 13.11.2014, the

learned Magistrate overruled this objection by giving reasons.

Breach of the peace does not mean fisticuffs, grievous hurt or

attempted murder. It is sufficient, if there is a present fear that

there will be a breach of the peace stemming from the dispute

unless the Court takes control of the matter.

I have no doubt, in the facts and circumstances of this case,

there was a real likelihood of a breach of the peace when the

Website Copy Website Copy

6

Magistrate issued summons on the appellant upon the first

information filed by the respondent.

In any event, it is my considered view that the Judgment of this

Court in Velupillai v. Sivanathan (supra) does not correctly

represent the law in this regard. In that case, Ismail J. sitting

alone stated as follows:

In Kanagasabai v. Mylvaganam (1976) 78 NLR 280, 283,

Sharvananda, J. observed Section 62 of the Administration

of Justice Law confers special jurisdiction on a Magistrate

to make orders to prevent a dispute affecting land

escalating and causing a breach of the peaceThe section

requires that the Magistrate should be satisfied, before

initiating the proceedings, that a dispute affecting land

exists and that such a dispute is likely to cause a breach of

the peace.

Under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

the formation of the opinion as to whether a breach of the

peace is threatened or likely is left to the police officer

inquiring into the dispute. The police officer is empowered to

file the information if there is a dispute affecting land and a

breach of the peace is threatened or likely. The Magistrate

is not put on inquiry as to whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely. In terms of section 66(2) the Court is

vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and make a

determination on the dispute regarding which information is

filed either under section 66(1)(a) or 66(1)(b).

Website Copy Website Copy

7

However when an information is filed under section 66(1)(b)

the only material that the Magistrate would have before him

is the affidavit information of an interested person and in

such a situation without the benefit of further assistance

from a police report, the Magistrate should proceed

cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there is a

dispute affecting land and whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely.

The same sentiments were echoed by Ismail J. in Punchi Nona v.

Padumasena [1994] 2 Sri LR 117 as well.

This view of Ismail J. has been followed in later decisions.

In the above dicta, In terms of section 66(2) the Court is vested

with jurisdiction to inquire into and make a determination on the

dispute regarding which information is filed either under section

66(1)(a) or 66(1)(b) is correct, but what follows thereafter is not,

i.e. However when an information is filed under section

66(1)(b)the Magistrate should proceed cautiously and ascertain

for himself whether there is a dispute affecting land and whether

a breach of the peace is threatened or likely.

Let me explain why I say so.

Under the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, by

sections 62-65, a special procedure was introduced for

Magistrates Courts to deal with disputes affecting lands where a

breach of the peace is threatened or likely.

Website Copy Website Copy

8

These provisions were repealed by the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, and replaced by sections 66-76 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979.

There is a significant difference between the provisions of the

Administration of Justice Law and the Primary Courts

Procedure Act on conferment of jurisdiction to the Magistrates

Courts in this regard.

Section 62(1) of the Administration of Justice Law provides as

follows:

Whenever a Magistrate, on information furnished by any

police officer or otherwise, has reason to believe that the

existence of a dispute affecting any land situated within his

jurisdiction is likely to cause a breach of the peace, he may

issue a notice (a) fixing a date for the holding of an inquiry

into the dispute; and (b) requiring every person concerned in

the dispute to attend at such inquiry and to furnish to the

court, on or before the date so fixed, a written statement

setting out his claim in respect of actual possession of the

land or the part in dispute and in respect of any right which

is the subject of the dispute.

It is noteworthy that section 62 of the Administration of Justice

Law conferred jurisdiction on the Magistrate only after the

Magistrate formed an opinion that the dispute relating to the

land is likely to cause a breach of the peace. According to this

section, the Magistrate shall have reason to believe that the

existence of a dispute affecting any land situated within his

jurisdiction is likely to cause a breach of the peace. This is a

Website Copy Website Copy

9

prerequisite for the Magistrate to assume jurisdiction to proceed

with the application. In other words, jurisdiction on the

Magistrate was not automatic upon the filing of the first

information. There was a legal requirement on the part of the

Magistrate to properly invoke jurisdiction.

This was applicable, as seen from section 62, irrespective of

whether the information [was] furnished by any police officer or

otherwise. Here, otherwise includes a party to the dispute.

Section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,

corresponds to section 62 of our Administrative Justice Law.

Section 145 of the Indian Code reads as follows:

Whenever an Executive Magistrate is satisfied from a report

of a police officer or upon other information that a dispute

likely to cause a breach of the peace exists concerning any

land or water or the boundaries thereof, within his local

jurisdiction, he shall make an order in writing, stating the

grounds of his being so satisfied, and requiring the parties

concerned in such dispute to attend his Court in person or

by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in

written statements of their respective claims as respects the

fact of actual possession of the subject of dispute.

Even under section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in

India, an essential condition for the assumption of jurisdiction

by the Magistrate is that he shall be satisfied from a report of a

police officer or upon other information that a dispute likely to

cause a breach of the peace exists. If he does not do so, the

proceedings shall be void in terms of section 461 of the Code of

Website Copy Website Copy

10

Criminal Procedure in India. Section 461 deals with fatal

irregularities that vitiate proceedings before the Magistrate. Vide

The Queen-Empress v. Gobind Chandra Das (1893) ILR 20 Cal

520.

Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam (1976) 78 NLR 280 is undoubtedly

the leading local authority on section 62 of the Administration of

Justice Law. Sharvananda J. (later C.J.), who delivered the

Judgment in that case, at pages 286 and 287, had this to say on

invocation of jurisdiction under section 62 of the Administration

of Justice Law:

It is essential for the assumption of jurisdiction under

section 62 that the Magistrate should have reason to

believe from a Police report or other information that a

dispute relating to land, which is likely to cause a breach of

the peace, exists. The report or other information should

contain sufficient material to enable the Magistrate to form

the belief that the dispute is likely to cause a breach of the

peace. The jurisdiction conferred on a Magistrate to institute

an inquiry under this section can be exercised only when

the dispute is such that it is likely to cause a breach of the

peace. It is the apprehension of a breach of the peace, and

not any infringement of private rights or dispossession of

any of the parties, which determines the jurisdiction of the

Magistrate. It is sufficient for a Magistrate to exercise the

powers under this section if he is satisfied on the material

on record that there is a present fear that there will be a

breach of the peace stemming from the dispute unless

proceedings are taken under the section. Power is conferred

Website Copy Website Copy

11

by section 62 in subjective termsthe Magistrate, being the

competent authority, is entitled to act when he has reason

to believe that the existence of a dispute affecting land is

likely to cause a breach of the peace. The condition

precedent to the exercise of the power is the formation of

such opinionthe factual basis of the opinion being the

information furnished by any Police officer or otherwise. A

Magistrate is not bound to take action on a Police report or

upon an expression of opinion by the Police. But, before he

takes action, he should have a statement of facts before

him so that he may exercise his own judgment in arriving at

a conclusion as to the necessity of taking action under this

section. The question whether, upon the material placed

before him, proceedings should be instituted under this

section is one entirely within the Magistrates discretion. He

may form his opinion on any information received. In my

view, he can base his action on a complaint filed by any of

the parties, or on a Police report. The Magistrate should

however proceed with great caution where there is no Police

report and the only material before him are statements of

interested persons. (emphasis mine)

It is against this backdrop that Ismail J. in Velupillai v.

Sivanathan (supra) stated that when the first information is filed

by a party to the dispute and not by the police, the Magistrate

should proceed cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there

is a dispute affecting land and whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely, little realising that the law in relation to

jurisdiction has been completely changed with the enactment of

the new Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Website Copy Website Copy

12

What was stated by Sharvananda J. in Kanagasabai v.

Mylvaganam (supra) under section 62 of the Administration of

Justice Law on invocation of jurisdiction is inapplicable under

section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Under section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law, a lot of

judicial time was wasted on the question of jurisdiction, in that

the Magistrate had to first embark upon an inquiry to ascertain

whether a breach of the peace was imminent before he issued

process. Also, under the Administration of Justice Law, there

was reluctance on the part of the parties to the dispute to

initiate action under section 62 in instances where police officers

were loath to report facts to the Court within the stipulated

period of two months from the date of dispossession due to

various reasons. The legislature addressed these two issues

when enacting the Primary Courts Procedure Act, which is a

home-grown Act.

Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, which replaced

section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law, reads as follows:

66(1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach

of the peace is threatened or likely-

(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute-

(i) shall with the least possible delay file an information

regarding the dispute in the Primary Court within

whose jurisdiction the land is situate and require

each of the parties to the dispute to enter into a bond

for his appearance before the Primary Court on the

Website Copy Website Copy

13

day immediately succeeding the date of filing the

information on which sittings of such court are held;

or

(ii) shall, if necessary in the interests of preserving the

peace, arrest the parties to the dispute and produce

them forthwith before the Primary Court within

whose jurisdiction the land is situate to be dealt with

according to law and shall also at the same time file

in that court the information regarding the dispute; or

(b) any party to such dispute may file an information by

affidavit in such Primary Court setting out the facts and

the relief sought and specifying as respondents the

names and addresses of the other parties to the dispute

and then such court shall by its usual process or by

registered post notice the parties named to appear in

court on the day specified in the noticesuch day being

not later than two weeks from the day on which the

information was filed.

Thus, under section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

the legislature has made it abundantly clear that the first

information can be filed either by the police officer inquiring into

the dispute under section 66(1)(a) or by any party to such

dispute under section 66(1)(b).

Then, under section 66(2), it has been enacted that when the

first information is filed under section 66(1), irrespective of

whether it is filed by the police or a party to the dispute, the

Website Copy Website Copy

14

Magistrate is automatically vested with jurisdiction to inquire

into and determine the matter, without further ado.

Section 66(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act runs as

follows:

Where an information is filed in a Primary Court under

subsection (1), the Primary Court shall have and is hereby

vested with jurisdiction to inquire into, and make a

determination or order on, in the manner provided for in this

Part, the dispute regarding which the information is filed.

(emphasis mine)

Hence, with all due respect, the dictum of Ismail J. in Velupillai

v. Sivananthan (supra) that, when an information is filed under

section 66(1)(b)the Magistrate should proceed cautiously and

ascertain for himself whether there is a dispute affecting land and

whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely does not

represent the correct position of law, and therefore, need not be

followed.

Under section 66(1), the formation of opinion as to whether a

breach of the peace is threatened or likely is left to the police

officer inquiring into the dispute or to any party to the dispute.

Both are on equal footing. Who files the information is beside the

point.

This is in consonance with the literal rule of interpretation,

which is the primary rule of interpretation of statutes. The

intention of the legislature is best achieved by giving the words

Website Copy Website Copy

15

of the Act their natural literal meaning unless it creates

absurdity.

The first argument of the learned counsel for the appellant fails.

Let me now consider the second argument advanced by the

learned counsel for the appellant.

The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the forcible

dispossession took place outside the period of two months before

the filing of the case.

Let me briefly state the orders the Magistrate is required to make

when the dispute is in relation to possession of land.

The substantive orders the Magistrates Court is required to

make when a dispute relating to land is reported to Court are

contained in section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Under section 68(1), the Court shall confirm possession of the

party who was in possession of the land on the date of the filing

of the first information in Court. This general rule is subject to

an exception, as provided for in section 68(3). That exception is,

if a party can prove that he was forcibly dispossessed within two

months immediately before the filing of the first information by

the party now in possession of the land, the former shall be

restored to possession.

In this case, the respondent filed the first information in the

Magistrates Court by way of an affidavit on 12.09.2014. On this

date, admittedly, the appellant was in possession of the land.

The respondent sought relief under section 68(3) on the basis

that he was forcibly dispossessed by the appellant on

Website Copy Website Copy

16

17.07.2014, which is within two months immediately prior to his

coming to Court.

The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that

after the first affidavit dated 12.09.2014, the respondent filed a

further affidavit dated 05.12.2014, which seems to be an

amendment of the original affidavit, and, therefore, the two-

month period should be calculated not from 12.09.2014 but

from 05.12.2014. Hence the learned counsel argues that the

respondent has not come before the Court within a period of two

months to seek relief under section 68(3).

I am afraid I am unable to agree with this argument.

As I stated earlier, the first information can be filed by the police

or a party to the dispute. If the first information is filed by the

police, in terms of section 66(1)(a), it can be filed by way of a

Report. However, if the first information is filed by a party, in

terms of section 66(1)(b), the information shall be filed by way of

an affidavit. Either way, according to section 66(3), the Court

shall, as the next step, give a date to the parties to file affidavits

with supporting documents if any to establish their respective

cases. The affidavit mentioned in section 66(3) applies both to

cases filed by the police and by a party. It is not confined to

cases filed by the police. Therefore, the second affidavit spoken

about by the learned counsel for the appellant is not an

amended affidavit. It is the affidavit required under section

66(3) of the of the Act. The first affidavit filed by the respondent

is the first information filed by way of an affidavit, as required by

section 66(1)(b) of the Act. According to section 68(3), the two-

Website Copy Website Copy

17

month period shall be counted not from the date of the affidavit,

but from the date on which the information was filed under

section 66. There is no dispute that the first information was

filed on 12.09.2014, and, therefore, the respondent was within

the stipulated period when he came to Court.

Therefore, the second argument is not entitled to succeed.

This leads me to consider the final argument of the learned

counsel for the appellant.

The final argument of the learned counsel relates to the

character of possession of the respondent in relation to the land

in dispute.

The learned counsel, referring to the pleadings filed by the

respondent in the District Court Case No. 7756/L and Revision

Application No. 28/2010 filed in the High Court of Civil Appeal,

submits that the respondent in those pleadings accepted that he

was a licensee of Milton Silva and had taken care of the land on

his behalf, and therefore, Milton Silva, being the owner, had

constructive possession of the land through the respondent and

the appellant who is the Power of Attorney Holder of Milton

Silva. The learned counsel cites the Judgment of Gunawardana

J. in Iqbal v. Majedudeen [1999] 3 Sri LR 213 in support.

In the first place, Milton Silva is not a party to this case to claim

constructive possession.

The respondent does not seem to me to be now accepting that he

is a licensee of Milton Silva.

Website Copy Website Copy

18

Even if he is an overholding licensee, he can only be ejected from

the land through due process of law. Vide Reginald Fernando v.

Pabilinahamy [2005] 1 Sri LR 31, Edirisuriya v. Edirisuriya (1975)

78 NLR 388. Milton Silva cannot forcibly eject the respondent.

In section 66 proceedings, it is not the task of the Magistrate to

decide the case on merits. That is the task of the District Court

in a properly constituted civil case. In section 66 proceedings,

what shall be looked at is possession and not title. Title is

foreign in section 66 applications. Possession here means not

the right to possession but actual possession.

Sharvananda J. in Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri LR

693 at 699 stated:

Evidence bearing on title can be considered only when the

evidence as to possession is clearly balanced and the

presumption of possession which flows from title may tilt the

balance in favour of the owner and help in deciding the

question of possession.

Such cases are indeed rare.

In section 66 proceedings, the character of possession does not

play a pivotal role. The object of these proceedings is to make a

provisional order to prevent a breach of the peace stemming

from the dispute, until a contrary order, as seen from sections

68(2), 68(3) and 69(2), is made by a competent court; or, as

seen from section 74, until the substantive rights of the parties

are established in a civil suit. In Podisingho v. Chandradsa

[1978/79] 2 Sri LR 93 at 96, Atukorala J. gave an extended

Website Copy Website Copy

19

meaning to the term competent court to encompass Tribunal

of competent jurisdiction.

In Kanagasabai v. Mylvaganam (supra), decided under the

Administration of Justice Law, Sharvananda J. at page 285

emphasised actual possession.

The inquiry under section 62 is directed to the determination

as to who was in actual possession of the land or part, in

dispute on the date of the issue of the notice under section

62(1), irrespective of the rights of the parties or their title to

the said land or part. The Magistrate, acting under section

62, is not deciding the rights of parties. The proviso to section

63(7) postulates the determination being made without

reference to the merits of the claims of the persons to the

possession of the land or part in dispute. The Magistrate is

concerned only with finding who was in actual possession

on that date and with maintaining the status quo.

Ramalingam v. Thangarajah (supra) is a case filed under section

66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. In the said case,

Sharvananda J., at page 698-699, heavily underlined the term

actual possession in section 66 proceedings.

In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land,

where a breach of peace is threatened or is likely under Part

VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the main point for

decision is the actual possession of the land on the date of

the filing of the information under section 66; but, where

forcible dispossession took place within two months before

the date on which the said information was filed the main

Website Copy Website Copy

20

point is actual possession prior to that alleged date of

dispossession. Section 68 is only concerned with the

determination as to who was in possession of the land or the

part on the date of the filing of the information under section

66. It directs the Judge to declare that the person who was

in such possession was entitled to possession of the land or

part thereof. Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the

Judge can come to a definite finding that some other party

had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two

months next proceeding the date on which the information

was filed under section 66. The effect of this sub-section is

that it enables a party to be treated to be in possession on

the date of the filing of the information though actually he

may be found to have been dispossessed before that date

provided such dispossession took place within the period of

two months next proceeding the date of the filing of the

information. It is only if such a party can be treated or

deemed to be in possession on the date of the filing of the

information that the person actually in possession can be

said not to have been in possession on the date of the filling

of the information. Thus, the duty of the Judge in

proceedings under section 68 is to ascertain which party

was or deemed to have been in possession on the relevant

date, namely, on the date of the filing of the information

under section 66. Under section 68 the Judge is bound to

maintain the possession of such person even if he be a rank

trespasser as against any interference even by the rightful

owner. This section entities even a squatter to the protection

of the law, unless his possession was acquired within two

Website Copy Website Copy

21

months of the filing of the information. That person is entitled

to possession until he is evicted by due process of law. A

Judge should therefore in an inquiry under Part VII of the

aforesaid Act, confine himself to the question of actual

possession on the date of filing of the information except in a

case where a person who had been in possession of the land

had been dispossessed within a period of two months

immediately before the date of the information. He is not to

decide any question of title or right to possession of the

parties to the land. (emphasis added)

In fact, the term actual possession was used in section 62(1) of

the Administration of Justice Law as well as in the

corresponding section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal

Procedure.

In Sohonis The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Vol.2, 18th

edition (1985), at page 1128, the learned author states:

The object of the section (145 of the Indian Code of Criminal

Procedure) is to bring to an end by a summary process

disputes relating to property, which are essentially of a civil

nature, with a view to prevent breach of peace. Orders

under the section are mere police orders which do not

concern question of title. The section is primarily meant for

the prevention of breach of peace where the dispute relates

to the possession of immovable property, and to provide a

speedy remedy by bringing the parties before the Court and

ascertaining who of them was in actual possession and to

maintain status quo until their rights are determined by a

Website Copy Website Copy

22

competent Court. Enquiry under this section is limited to

the question as to who was in actual possession on the

date of the preliminary order irrespective of the rights of the

parties, and not determine the right and title of the parties.

Ratanlal & Dhirajlal in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 21st

edition (2013), equate actual possession to physical possession.

At page 217 they say:

Actual possession means actual physical possession, that

is, the possession of the person who has his feet on the

land, who is ploughing it, sowing it or growing crops on it,

entirely irrespective of whether he has title or right to

possess it. It is not the same as a right to possession nor

does it mean lawful or legal possession. It may be that of a

trespasser without any title whatever. The aim and object

of the section is the maintenance and preservation of the

public peace.

It is significant to note that, unlike under section 62 of the

Administration of Justice Law, under section 68 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, the word possession has not been

qualified by the word actual, suggesting that possession need

not necessarily be actual.

In any event, actual possession does not mean actual physical

possession at all times. Actual physical possession will vary

with the subject matter. The owner of unworked minerals was

held in Ranchi Zamindari Co. Ltd. v. Pratab Udainath Sahi Deo

(AIR 1939 Patna 209) to be in actual possession of the same if he

is in a position, at any moment, to work them or to permit

others to do so. Sarker on Criminal Procedure, 6th edition

(1992), (citing Nabin, 25 WR 18, Mahesh, 26 CRLJ 398), states,

at page 311, Receiving rents of tenants is actual possession.

Whilst the right to possession resides in the owner, another can

of course be in actual possession. Servant, manager, agent are a

few examples of the latter. In such cases, the former can claim

actual possession of the latter against third parties in section 66

proceedings. This can be termed actual possession through

subordinates, or else, constructive possession.

In Iqbal v. Majedudeen (supra), the case cited by the learned

counsel for the appellant, upon the death of her husband, the

respondent went to live with her mother, locking up and leaving

the premises in question where she was living earlier. The

appellant, after returning to Sri Lanka, broke open the door of

the premises and entered into possession. This happened within

two months of filing the first information in Court. All three

Courtsthe Magistrates Court, the High Court and the Court of

Appealcorrectly held with the respondent.

In my view, the respondent in that case was in actual possession

of the premises because actual possession does not, as I stated

earlier, mean uninterrupted physical presence throughout the

day.

In the course of the Judgment, Gunawardena J., at pages 215-

216, observed:

The test for determining whether a person is in possession

of any corporeal thing, such as a house, is to ascertain

Website Copy Website Copy

24

whether he is in general control of it. Salmond observes that

a person could be said to be in possession of, say, a house,

even though that person is miles away and able to exercise

very little control, if any. It is also significant to note that in

her statement to the Police, the 2nd respondent-appellant

had admitted that the 1st respondent lived in the relevant

premises during the life-time of the latters husband. It is

interesting to notice that the 1st respondents position that

she was in possession and was ousted by 2nd respondent-

petitioner-appellant is largely proved, as explained above,

on the statement that the 2nd respondent-petitioner-

appellant herself has made to the Police.

The law recognizes two kinds of possession:

(i) when a person has direct physical control over a thing

at a given time, he is said to have actual possession of

it;

(ii) a person has constructive possession when he, though

not in actual possession, has both the power and the

intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control

over a thing either directly or through another person.

In this case in hand, perhaps, it cannot be said that the 1st

respondent has actual physical possession because she

was not in physical occupation of the house in question; but

she clearly had, at least, constructive possession because

she, by keeping the premises locked, clearly exercised not

only dominium or control over the property in question but

also excluded others from the possession thereof. By

25

keeping the premises locked, she, i.e. the 1st respondent,

had not only continued to retain her rights in respect of the

property in question but also was exercising a claim to the

exclusive control thereof, and her affidavit evidence is that

she had not terminated her intention to revert to the

physical occupation of the relevant premises.

In Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th edition (2004) by P.J.

Fitzgerald, at page 266, the learned author says that the concept

of possession is difficult to define as it is an abstract notion and

not purely a legal concept. He opines:

Whether a person has ownership depends on rules of law;

whether he has possession is a question that could be

answered as a matter of fact and without reference to law at

all.

Salmond at page 282 states:

In law one person may possess a thing for and on account

of someone else. In such a case the latter is in possession

by the agency of him who so holds the thing on his behalf.

The possession thus held by one man through another may

be termed mediate, while that which is acquired or retained

directly or personally may be distinguished as immediate or

direct.

At pages 285-286, he further says:

In all cases of mediate possession two persons are in

possession of the same thing at the same time. Every

mediate possessor stands in relation to a direct possessor

through whom he holds. If I deposit goods with an agent,

he is in possession of them as well as I. He possesses for

me, and I possess through him. A similar duplicate

possession exists in the case of master and servant,

landlord and tenant, bailor and bailee, pledgor and

pledgee. There is, however, an important distinction to be

noticed. For some purposes mediate possession exists as

against third persons only, and not as against the

immediate possessor. Immediate possession, on the other

hand, is valid as against all the world, including the

mediate possessor himself. Thus if I deposit goods with a

warehouse man, I retain possession as against all other

persons; because as against them I have the benefit of the

warehousemans custody. But as between warehouseman

and myself, he is in possession and not I. So in the case of

a pledge, the debtor continuous to possess quoad the world

at large; but as between debtor and creditor, possession is

in the latter. The debtors possession is mediate and

relative; the creditors is immediate and absolute. So also

with landlord and tenant, bailor and bailee, master and

servant, principal and agent, and all other case of mediate

possession. (emphasis mine)

Sharker on Criminal Procedure, 6th edition (1992), at page 311,

(citing Venugopal, A 1945 M 255, Karnadhar, 1948 1 Cal 150),

states:

As between rival landlords or between a landlord and the

tenants of another landlord, the possession of the tenant is

the possession of the landlord.

In Jaikrit Singh v. Sohan Raj (AIR (46) 1959 Punjab 63 at 69) it

was held that:

It is true that the possession of a servant of his masters

property on his behalf is the masters possession with

regard to third persons. But, if there is a dispute between

the master and the servant, themselves, about the

possession of the property, the word possession will have

to be interpreted in the sense of actual physical possession.

The term possession connotes an intricate and subtle legal

conception, which changes with circumstances.

Sohoni (op. cit., page 1184) (citing Shaikh Munshi v. Balabhadra

Prasad Das, 1961 Cut. L.T. 10, Dasrathi v. State of Orissa, 1971

Cut. L.T. 270), states:

Even where a servant is in possession over property

belonging to his master on his behalf, the possession will

become his own when he continuous to remain in

possession after leaving the service of his master, or even

otherwise. His possession, therefore, even though wrongful,

will be maintained if it has continued for over two months

prior to the institution of the proceedings.

The master, principal, licensor, lessor, landlord and the like, in

my view, are not without immediate remedy. They can

appropriately file a civil suit in the District Court to eject the

unlawful occupier, and, pending determination of the action,

can obtain an interim injunction preventing the delinquent from

taking advantage of his wrongdoing on the Roman-Dutch Law

principle spoliatus ante omnia restituendus est, which is for

Website Copy Website Copy

28

convenience known as the wrongdoer principle: A wrongdoer

shall not be allowed to benefit out of his own wrongdoing. Vide

Seelawathie Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne [1982] 1 Sri LR 384,

Subramanium v. Shabdeen [1984] 1 Sri LR 48, Kariyawasam v.

Sujatha Janaki [2013] BLR 77.

In Seelawathie Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne (supra), Victor

Perera J., at page 391, stated:

[I]f a person in unlawful possession could not be ejected

pending trial, he could still be restrained from taking any

benefits arising out of such wrongful possession, otherwise

the Court would be a party to the preserving for the

defendant-appellant a position of advantage brought about

by her own unlawful or wrongful conduct.

In The Public Trustee v. Cader (1963) 66 CLW 109 it was held:

Where an employee willfully continuous to remain in control

of a place of business, the administrator of the deceased

owners estate has a right to an interim injunction under

section 86 of the Courts Ordinance restraining that

employee from continuing in control.

Let me now epitomise the requirement of possession expected in

section 66 proceedings.

In section 66 proceedings:

(a) What is required is actual possession. Actual

possession means actual physical possession. That is

direct or immediate possession.

Website Copy Website Copy

29

(b) Possession of persons who entered into possession in a

subordinate character such as tenant, lessee, licensee,

agent, servant, can be relied upon by landlord, lessor,

licensor, principal, master, respectively. That is

constructive or mediate possession.

(c) Nevertheless, if the dispute regarding possession is

between the two categories mentioned in (b) above,

possession of the former shall prevail over the latter.

Constructive possession, as discussed in Iqbal v. Majedudeen

(supra), shall be understood subject to (c) above.

Then, it is clear that even if the respondent is considered an

agent of Milton Silva, the latter cannot claim possession through

the former, as the dispute to possession is not between Milton

Silva and a third party but between Milton Silva and his agent.

Therefore, I regret my inability to agree with the final argument

of the learned counsel for the appellant as well.

During the course of argument, it was revealed that Milton Silva

later filed a civil case in the District Court against the

respondent in order to vindicate his rights to this land and eject

the respondent therefrom. The parties shall have their

substantive rights decided in the said civil case.

For the aforesaid reasons, I affirm the Judgment of the High

Court, which affirmed the order of the Magistrates Court, and

dismiss the appeal, but without costs.
