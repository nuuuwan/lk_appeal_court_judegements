Written Submissions tendered on:

Appellant-Petitioner on 04.09.2018

Respondents on 08.10.2018

Decided on: 03.05.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Appellant-Petitioner (Petitioner) was appointed as a teacher in 1970 and at all times material

to this application was serving at Richmond College, Galle. By letter dated 22.12.1998 she

requested for two weeks leave from 24.12.1998 to 07.01.1999 travel to Canada to attend the

funeral of a relation (P6). This was approved by the Secretary Ministry of Education and Higher

Education by letter dated 29.01.1999 (11R2).

The Petitioner claims that while she was in Canada, she fell sick and was not in a fit state to travel

and informed the relevant authorities including the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canada along

with medical certificates (P8, P9, Pl0 and Pll). However, the Secretary, Ministry of Education

has in his affidavit stated that there is no record ofthe ministry having received these documents.

However, by letter dated 08.07.1999 (P12) the Southern Province Zonal Director has

recommended the application of the Petitioner for the extension of overseas leave from

07.01.1999. The overseas leave of the Petitioner was then extended until 08.02.1999 (P13).

Thereafter, the Petitioner sought a further two months extension of her overseas leave by letters

dated 10.02.1999 and 16.03.1999 (P14 and PiS). It appears that no decision was taken on these

requests. By letter dated 30.04.1999 (P18) the Petitioner applied to retire from service with effect

from 23.03.1999. The Petitioner was issued a vacation of post notice dated 23.03.2001 (P23) to

be effective from 08.02.1999, the last date of her approved overseas vacation leave.

The Petitioner denies receiving the vacation of post notice and states that she came to Sri Lanka

for the first time on 31.03.2006 after leaving for Canada in 1998 and was interested in finding out

what happened to her application for retirement and then found out that a vacation of post

notice had been issued to her. The Petitioner states that thereafter she appealed to the

Secretary, Ministry of Education (P26) who informed that the appeal cannot be entertained as it

was not made within time (P28). She has then appealed to the Public Service Commission (PSC)

by appeal dated 03.09.2007 (P30) which had been refused as it was made 8 years after the

vacation of post notice (P31).

The Petitioner then appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) by letter dated

04.03.2008 (P32) which was dismissed (P3S). Hence this application.

The Petitioner has sought the following reliefs:

(b) Issue a writ of certiorari quashing and setting aside the decision of the AAT dated

04.05.2009 marked P3S;

(c) Issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision marked as P23 issued by the Zonal Director

of Education of Southern Province, vacating the post of the Petitioner;

(d) Issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision marked as P28 issued by the Secretary to

the Ministry of Education rejecting the appeal of the Petitioner for reinstatement and

retirement;

(e) Issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision marked P29 issued on behalf of the

Southern Province Director of Education rejecting the appeal dated 20.05.2006 of the

Petitioner for reinstatement and retirement;

Page 5 of 8

(f) Issue a writ of certiorari quashing the decision marked as P31 issued by the Senior

Secretary of the PSC rejecting the appeal dated 03.08.2007 of the Petitioner for

reinstatement and retirement;

(g) Issue a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent-Respondent, p t and 2nd Respondents

and 11th to 13th Respondents to reinstate the Petitioner to work and to retire from

23.03.1999 with all pension rights as of 23.03.1999;

(h) Issue a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent-Respondent, p t and 2nd Respondents

and 11th to 13th Respondents to take all necessary steps to reinstate the Petitioner to work

and retire from 23.03.1999, with all pension rights as of 23.03.1999 according to the Class

she was in, with all arrears of pension up to date, from 23.03.1999.

On 08.09.2015 the learned counsel for the Petitioner informed court that she is not pursuing the

relief seeking to have pension rights since the Petitioner had not been made permanent in the

post she held.

Before considering the merits of the application I wish to set out the scope of the judicial review

that this Court must venture to perform in the circumstances of this matter. Article 61A of the

Constitution reads:

"Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article 126, no court or

tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any

manner call in question any order or decision made by the Commission, a Committee, or

any public officer, in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such

Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under

any other law."

In Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawla and Others [(2004) 2 SrLL.R. 180 at 190] Marsoof J. held:

"In view of the elaborate scheme put in place by the Seventeenth Amendment to the

Constitution to resolve all matters relating to the public service, this Court would be

extremely reluctant to exercise any supervisory jurisdiction in the sphere of the public

service. I have no difficulty in agreeing with the submission made by the learned State

Counsel that this Court has to apply the preclusive clause contained in Article 61A of the

Page 6 of 8

Constitution in such a manner as to ensure that the elaborate scheme formulated by the

Seventeenth Amendment is given effect to the fullest extent."

However, in Ratnayake v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Others [SC (Spl/LA) No. 173/2011,

S.C.M. 22.02.2013] the Supreme Court decided that Article 61A of the Constitution does not

prevent the Court of Appeal from exercising judicial review in respect of orders made by the AAT

since AAT is not a body exercising any power delegated to it by the PSC, and is an appellate

tribunal constituted in terms of Article 59(1) of the Constitution.

Nevertheless, it is an established rule of interpretation that a court cannot do indirectly what it

is prohibited from doing directly [Bandaranaike v. Weeraratne and Others (1981) 1 SrLL.R. 10 at

16]. Accordingly, I hold that this Court is not empowered to grant any of the relief (c) to (h)

claimed in the petition.

The Supreme Court has taken two different approaches to legislative attempts at restricting or

ousting the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal set out in Article 140 of the Constitution otherwise

than by way of constitutional provisions. On one hand it has been held that section 22 of the

Interpretation Ordinance restricted the Court of Appeal exercising judicial review in certain

circumstances [Edmond v. D.S. Fernando (1995) 1 SrLL.R. 407; Withanaratchi v. Gunawardena

and Others (1996) 1 SrLL.R. 253]. However, in Atapattu v. People's Bank [(1997) 1 SrLL.R. 208]

the Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal set out in Article 140 of the

Constitution can only be ousted by a constitutional provision. Thereafter, in Moosajees Limited

v. Arthur and Others [(2006) 1 SrLL.R. 65] the Supreme Court held that Article 140 of the

Constitution prevails over section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance.

Although the earlier decisions were not overruled, I am in respectful agreement with the

approach taken by the Supreme Court in Atapattu v. People's Bank (supra) and Moosajees

Limited v. Arthur and Other (supra) and hold that section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal Act NO. 4 of 2002 which states that a decision made by the Tribunal shall be final and

conclusive and shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings in a court of law does not

oust the jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution to

exercise judicial review over orders made by the AAT.

,

Therefore, there is no impediment to this Court considering the relief claimed in prayer (b) to the

petition. The basis of relief if any must be based on Illegality, Irrationality or Procedural

Impropriety.

The AAT in its order P35 has considered the failure on the part of the Petitioner to tender an

appeal against the vacation of post notice within three months from the date on which it was

served on her as stipulated in Section 37.1 Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code. The

Petitioner contends that she was never served with the vacation of post notice and obtained a

copy only in 2007 when she was inquiring into her application for retirement. Her appeal to the

PSC is 8 years after the date of issue of the vacation of post notice.

I find it difficult to accept the version of the Petitioner. In any event, if that is the correct position

it shows a complete lack of diligence on her part in not checking on the status of her application

to retire. The Petitioner has sought discretionary relief from court and it is established law that

the conduct of the Petitioner is relevant in such context. The Petitioner has been sleeping over

her rights and I am not inclined to exercise the discretion of court in her favour. In any event, I

see no illegality, irrationality or any procedural impropriety in the order of the AAT.

Applications is dismissed with costs.
