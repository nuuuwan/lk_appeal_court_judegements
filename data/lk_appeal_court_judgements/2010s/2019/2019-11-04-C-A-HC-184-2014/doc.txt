The Accused-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge of Badulla dated 10.11.2014 in case No. 4912011.

Facts of the case:

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was indicted in

the High Court of Badulla, for committing rape on one Was ana Sandamali on or

about 28.11.2008 at Bandarawela, an offence punishable under section 364 (1) of

the Penal Code as amended. After the closure of the case for the prosecution, when

the defence was called, the accused opted to testify and three more witnesses

testified for defence. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

convicted the accused for the offense ofrape, by judgment dated 10.11.2014 and

sentenced the appellant as follows;

1. A term of 12 years rigorous imprisonment.

Page 2 of 11

2. A fine of Rs 10,000/= with ~ default tenn of six months simple

imprisonment.

3. Compensation of Rs. 150,000/= to be paid to the victim and if

default one year tenn of rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal, in

the written submissions and submitted that the conviction is not safe .

. I. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by failure to consider that the

version of the prosecutrix is highly improbable when she states that she had

to pretend she is going to see a movie with the accused appellant who raped

her.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has completely misdirected himself with

regard to the conflict of evidence between medical expert and the

prosecutrix which completely diminish the tenability of the prosecution

version and thereby casts a doubt on the prosecution case.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself with regard to the

per se contradictions in the testimony of the prosecutrix and her eyidence is

not corroborated by any material witnesses.

4. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself with regard to the plea

of alibi and failed to duly analyze the plea of alibi according to established

principles of law and thereby the conviction is bad in Law.

5. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to evaluate the

defence evidence judicially and thereby caused miscarriage of justice and

conviction is therefore bad in Law.

6. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by speculating evidence

which are not in record and thereby the conviction is bad in Law.

The incident is summarized as follows;

The prosecutrix, Was ana Sandamali (hereinafter referred to as the 'prosecutrix'

and/or 'PW 01') was an 18 year old woman who was separated from her husband.

The prosecutrix was living with her parents at the time of the incident. The

accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was one of her

neighbours. On the day in question, her parents had left for work and-her sister had

gone to school and the prosecutrix was alone at home. The appellant had walked in

to the room, where the prosecutrix was reading a book and asked her whether she

was feeling lonely without her husband. Thereafter, the appellant had thrown her

on the bed and had removed her underwear and raped her. The prosecutrix had

tried to escape, but the appellant had continued the act until ejaculation. The

prosecutrix had then escaped and had gone to her grandmother'S house which was

nearby. She had returned to her house about 15 minutes later and the appellant too

had returned to her house. The appellant had told her that he would find her

employment and give money and asked her not to tell anyone about this incident.

Thereafter, the appellant had suggested the prosecutrix to come to see a movie. The

prosecutrix had agreed and gone out of the house to board a bus and the accused

too had boarded the same bus. When the bus reached Bandarawela town, the

prosecutrix had got out of the bus and run to her mother's work place and had told

her about the incident in question. The prosecutrix had referred to the appellant as

Mahathun Mama and he was known to the prosecutrix as a neighbour. Thereafter,

the prosecutrix had also met her father in the town and he had asked the mother

and the prosecutrix to go to Police. Accordingly, around 3.45pm on the same day,

they had lodged a complaint at the Police Station, Welimada.

Page 4 of 11

Subsequently, the prosecutrix was referred. to the Judicial Medical Officer of

Badulla Hospital. The JMO testified at the trial as prosecution witness No. 07 and

the medical report was marked as 'P 01'.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge

misdirected himself by failing to consider the fact that the version of the

prosecutrix is highly improbable when she stated that she had to pretend to go for a

movie with the appellant who raped her. The prosecutrix, in her evidence, has

explained the reason why she had to pretend to go for a movie with the appellant.

The prosecutrix testified that she agreed to go for a movie since she felt that the

appellant would not let her leave the house (Page 32 of the brief). The Learned

High Court Judge was of the view that any victim in a situation like this would try

to inform the incident to a close relative and therefore, the prosecutrix in the instant

case had acted in the same manner which is justifiable. PW 3 Nalini Mallika

(victims' mother) testified that, on the day in question, the prosecutrix had come to

meet her at the hotel where she worked and told mother that the appellant harassed

her. There had been no contradiction marked in her evidence. Therefore, I am of

the view that the prosecutrix had explained her reason to act under a pretense, to go

for a movie with the appellant, to the satisfaction of Court. Therefo're, the 1st

ground of appeal should fail.

Now I wish to consider the 20d and 3'd grounds of appeal together. It is argued for

the appellant that there was a conflict of evidence between the medical expert and

the prosecutrix and the evidence of the prosecutrix is not corroborated by any

material witnesses. The JMO, at the trial, reproduced the short history of the

prosecutrix, in which she had described the incident in detail. The JMO had

observed that there were no new injuries in the hymen of the prosecutrix and

however, there was a contusion on her labia. The JMO testified that injuries of the

Page 5 of 11

prosecutrix were 100% consistent with the sh9rt history given by the victim (Page

55 of the brief). At the same time, it is important to mention that our law, as it

stands today, does not require corroboration from a prosecutrix unless her version

of evidence appears to be unreliable and inconsistent.

In the case of Sunil and another V. The Attorney General (1986) 1 Sri L.R 230,

it was held that,

"It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could

be acted on even in the absence of corroboration ... "

In the case of Premasiri V. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R 106, Justice E.

Basnayake observed that,

"The learned counsel complained that the accused was convicted on

uncorroborated evidence. There is no rule that there must in every case, be

corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. (Gour on Penal

Law of India 11th Edition page 2657 quoting Raghobgr Singhe vs. State(2);

Rameshwar, Kalyan Singh vs. State of Rajas than (3)). It is well settled law

that a conviction for the offence of rape can be based on the sole. testimony

of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there is no infirmity.

(Bhola Ram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (4)). If the evidence of the

prosecutrix inspires corifidence, it must be relied upon without seeking

corroboration of her statement in material particular. The testimony of the

prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the

trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing

with cases involving sexual molestation. State of Punjab vs. Gurmit

Singhe(5).

Page 6 of 11

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of corroboration as a matter

of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to dispense with

it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath Biswas vs.

State(6) ... " (Emphasis added)

In the case of B. Bhoghinbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat (AIR) 1983 SC

753, it was held that,

" ... in the Indian setting, refUsal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to the

injury. "

In Premasiri V. The Queen [77 N.L.R 86] it was held that,

"In a charge of rape it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as

to convince the Jury that she is speaking the truth ... "

In light of above, it is understood that law does not prevent a Judge from entering a

conviction on a sole testimony of a victim, if the Judge is completely satisfied that

the victim is speaking the truth and the testimony of the victim is reliable.

It is pertinent to note that there had been no contradictions marked in the testimony

of the prosecutrix in the instant case. Even though the Learned Counsel for the

appellant at the High Court, made several suggestions to the prosecutrix that she

was making a false allegation, he was unable to mark any major contradiction

which go to the root of the case. Further, the version of the prosecutrix was

corroborated by the testimonies of her parents and the JMO and the police

evidence. I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was correct in being

Page 7 of 11

satisfied that the testimony of the prosecutri~ was reliable and credible, in such a

backdrop.

Therefore, I see no merits in the above mentioned grounds of appeal.

Now I wish to consider the 4th and 5th grounds of appeal which basically address

the issue of failure to evaluate the defense evidence judicially by the Learned High

Court Judge.

The appellant denied his involvement in the incident in entirety. The appellant

testified that on the day in question, he went to his vegetable plot around 9.00 am

and returned home around 1.00pm. The wife of the appellant testified that she

accompanied him. Two other witnesses who lived in neighbourhood testified that

they did not hear any screaming for help, on the date of the incident even though

they were in a close proximity at that time. I observe that the Learned High Court

Judge had evaluated the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant at pages 124

to 126 of the brief. The Learned High Court Judge was of the view that there was

no cogent evidence to prove that the above said two witnesses were in fact in

proximity at the time of the incident and the evidence of the defence did not

discredit the PW 01 (prosecutrix) or other prosecution witnesses. I observe that the

Learned High Court Judge has given reasons for his decision to refuse the defence

version and therefore, I see no merits in the 4 th and 5th grounds of appeal as well.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Learned High Court

Judge misdirected himself by speculating evidence which are not in record.

However, the Learned Counsel has not elaborated or specified what those evidence

were. Upon perusal of the judgment, I am unable to find any such evidence, which

were not in record, evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge. Therefore, the

final ground of appeal too should fail.

Page 8 of 11

Further, I am mindful of the fact that the Lewped High Court Judge who delivered

the judgment had the benefit of assessing the demeanour and deportment of the

witnesses from the very beginning of the trial.

In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh V. M. K. Anthony (AIR 1985 SC 48], it

was held that,

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undo.ubtedly necessary for the

court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and irifirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief "

In the case of Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa (S.C.

Appeal No: 7912008 - Decided on 06.05.2010], it was held that,

"Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the

trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established tha~ the Court

must exercise its judgment on the nature tenor of the inconsistency or

contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too much importance (Vide, Boghi

Bhai Hirji Bhai v. State ofGujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753).

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies and

omissions (Vide, Dashiraj v. the State AIR (1964) Tri. 54). When

contradictions are marked, the judge should direct his attention to whether

Page 9 of 11

they are material or not and the witness should be given the opportunity of

explaining that matter (Vide, State of UP v. Anthony AIR 1985 SC 48; A.G.

v. Visuvalingam 47 NLR 286) ... "

It is trite law that the appellate Court will not interfere with the findings of the

Trial Judge who in fact has a better opportunity of observing the demeanour and

deportment of witnesses, unless it is proved that the Trial Judge was misdirected.

I observe that, in the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge has made a well-

reasoned judgment evaluating all the evidence placed before him and I see no

reason to interfere with the same. Therefore, I affirm the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the appellant, dated 10.11.2014, by the Learned High Court

Judge of Badulla.

The appeal is dismissed without costs.
