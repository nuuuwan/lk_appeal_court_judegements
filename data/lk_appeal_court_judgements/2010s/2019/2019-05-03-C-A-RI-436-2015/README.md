Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court against the

two defendants 10 years ago seeking ejectment of them from the

premises in suit as overholding lessees, and damages. The

defendants whilst admitting in paragraph 3 of the answer that

the plaintiffs are the owners of the premises, sought dismissal of

the action. When the trial was in progress, parties arrived at a

settlement and written terms of settlement signed by the parties

dated 17.03.2015 were tendered to Court1, and also parties

signed the case record signifying the settlement.2 This was

followed by entering the decree.3

According to the settlement, the plaintiff has agreed to sell and

the defendants have agreed to purchase by way of a deed of

transfer to be executed on or before 30.06.2015 whatever

interests would be allotted to the plaintiff in the pending

partition action (No.20404/P) before the same Court for a sum of

Rs.3.5 million. Admittedly the premises in question falls within

the corpus of the said partition action. The parties have inter

alia further agreed that, in the event the defendants fail to pay

the said money on or before 30.06.2015, the plaintiffs are

entitled to take out a writ, after 07.07.2015, to evict the

defendants from the premises without notice and also to recover

damages, costs of the action and expenses for execution of the

writ.

The defendants have defaulted payment on or before the due

date, i.e. 07.07.2015. Thereafter, they, through their Attorney,

by way of petition and affidavit dated 07.07.2015, whilst

reaffirming the said settlement, have moved time till 17.08.2015

to make the payment purely on sympathetic grounds.4

This application has been supported on 09.07.2015 and the

plaintiff has objected to it and the Court has refused the

application.6

To my amazement, thereafter, the same Attorney for the

defendants has made an application by way of petition and

affidavit dated 14.08.2015 seeking to set aside the said

settlement on the basis that, as the Final Decree had not been

entered in the partition action, the plaintiffs did not have a legal

right to enter into the said settlement!7 In that application, the

Attorney has sought to stay the proceedings until the

determination of that application. This application has been

supported on 28.08.2015 and the learned District Judge has

very correctly refused to stay the proceedings by giving copious

reasons and issued only notice.8

It is thereafter, whilst the said application is pending

determination before the District Court, the defendants have

come before this Court by way of revision and/or restitutio in

integrum seeking to set aside the settlement in the District Court

on the same basis. Because of this application, upon an

undertaking given, proceedings of the District Court case have

been stayed from 2015 up to now!

I must mention without mincing words, this is absolutely abuse

of the process of Court in the highest degree, which shall be

condemned in the strongest possible terms.

It is my considered view that, if the defendants wanted to set

aside the settlement entered before the District Court, they

cannot bypass the District Court and come before this Court to

achieve that objective. They must first make the application

before the District Court (as they have already done), and appeal

against that order if the order is unfavourable to them. They

cannot maintain parallel proceedings in two Courts in order to

achieve their ulterior motives.

As I have mentioned before, the complaint of the Attorney of the

defendants is that, as the Final Decree had not been entered in

the partition action, the plaintiffs did not have a legal right to

enter into the said settlement. If that is correct, the same

Attorney is responsible for misleading his clients and the Court

to enter into an illegal settlement. However this argument is

devoid of any merit and makes obviously for collateral purposes.

A party in a partition action can sell, pending partition, whatever

the interests he might ultimately be allotted in the final decree of

partition. Sale of contingent rights pending partition is

5

absolutely permitted in law. (Rajapakse v. Dassanayake (1928)

29 NLR 509, Salee v. Natchia (1936) 39 NLR 259)

In Manchanayake v. Perera (1945) 46 NLR 457 it was held:

A conveyance executed after the institution of a partition

action, and before the entering of the final decree,

purporting to sell, assign, transfer, and set over to the

vendee the interest to which the said vendor may be

declared entitled to in the final decree to be entered into in

the said case from and out of all that land (i.e., the subject

of the partition suit) is valid and not obnoxious to section 17

of the Partition Ordinance. It passes an immediate interest

in the property and is not merely an agreement to convey in

the future.

In Wijesinghe v. Sonnadara (1951) 53 NLR 241 it was held:

The sale by a co-owner in land of whatever interests might

ultimately be allotted to him under the decree in a pending

partition action may be construed as a conventio rei

speratae. In such a case, if some benefit, even to a far

smaller extent than the parties had originally hoped for,

accrued to the seller under the partition decree, the

purchaser is not entitled to claim a cancellation of the sale

on the ground of failure of consideration.

In that eventuality, the transferee need not be added as a party

to the partition action. (Abeyratne v. Rosalin [2001] 3 Sri LR 308)

Nor is there any necessity to execute another deed after entering

the Final Decree as the Lot will automatically pass to the

transferee without any further conveyance. (Sillie Fernando v.

Silman Fernando 64 NLR 404, Karunaratne v. Perera 67 NLR 529)

The settlement entered into in the District Court is not illegal. I

unhesitatingly dismiss the application of the defendant-

petitioners. The defendant-petitioners shall pay a sum of

Rs.200,000/= as costs of this application to the plaintiff-

respondent.
