A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Respondent-Appellant, (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the determination dated

25/0912017, of the 2nd Respondent, Land Survey Council (hereinafter referred to as

the Counci I) that the Appellant has trespassed into lands belonging to the

Complainant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent), and

demarcated a roadway over the Respondent's land at the request of one Dulip

Kolombage. It is alleged that the Appellant by plan bearing No. 5220, had annexed

land allotments marked Lots 2 and 3B of plan No. 2052, without the consent of the

Respondent. The Council determined that plan bearing No. 5220 made by the

Appellant was defective and the Appellant by certifying sllch plan discharged his

Page 2 of 13

professional duties contrary to provisions set out in Section 45 (1) (c) (ii) (A), of

the Survey Act No. 17 of 2002, (hereinafter referred to as the Act), and was found

guilty of professional misconduct.

The Appellant has filed this application under Section 49 of the Act, which

states as follows;

"Every person who is dissatisfied with -

a) any decision of the Council relating to an application by him for

registration or the issue of an Annual Practicing Licence; or

b) any order of the Council under section 47 relating to him,

may, within thirty days after notice of the decision or order has been

communicated to him by the Secretary, appeal to the Court of Appeal against the

decision or order, as the case may be. "

When this case was taken up for argument, the learned State Counsel

appearing for the Council took up a preliminary objection that this application

made in terms of Section 49 of the Act does not envisage an order the Council can

make in terms of Section 47 of the Act. In particular, the learned State Counsel has

drawn attention to Section 47(f) of the Act and submits that,

the order under reference does not qualifY to be "any appropriate order as to

costs" within the 1st limb of subsection (f) of Section 47, and

Page 3 of 13

the order under reference does not qualify to be "any appropriate order as to

costs or otherwise" within the 2nd limb of subsection (0 of Section 47, therein,

the generic term "otherwise" is submitted to be 'ejusdem generis' to the

classification of any appropriate orders the Council is empowered to make

under Section 47(0 of the Act.

The contention of the learned Counsel is that, where generic phrases follow

specific phrases the interpretation of the generic phrase should be restricted to the

category/ genus to which the specific phrase belongs to and the Court should not

give a wider construction to such words unless there is something to show that a

wider interpretation is intended.

Therefore, it is contended that;

Firstly,

"the generic term "otherwise" is submitted to be 'ejusdem generis' to the

classification of any appropriate orders the Land Survey Council is empowered to

make under subsection 47(f).

Secondly,

by the application of the ejusdem generis rule, the generic term, 'otherwise ' has to

be construed in the same genus as costs and! or as something relating to costs or

incurring of costs by the Land Survey Council. "

Section 47 of the Act is as follows;

Page 4 of 13

(1) "Where the Council, after conducting an inquiry in accordance with this Part

is satisfied that a registered surveyor is guilty of professional misconduct the

Council may, make one or more of the following orders -

(a) make an order that the registration of the registered surveyor be cancelled

and name of such surveyor be removedfrom the register;

(b) make an order that the registration of the registered surveyor be suspended

for a period not exceeding three years;

(c) make an order that the annual Practising Licence issued to a Registered

Surveyor be cancelled;

(d) make an order that the annual Practising Licence issued to a Registered

Surveyor be suspended;

(e) make an order that the registered surveyor may, for a period not exceeding

three years, engage in the practice of land surveying subject to such

conditions as the Council may impose;

(f) make any other appropriate order as, to costs or otherwise as the Council

considers appropriate.

(2) ---------- "

In Brindra's "Interpretation of Statutes" (7'h Ed. 1984) at page 339, it is

stated that;

"The rule of ejusdem generis is that where general words follow particular and

specific words of the same nature, the general words must be confined to the

Page 5 of 13

things of the same kind as those specified. But it is clearly laid down by decided

cases that the specific words must form a distinct genus or category. It is not an

inviolable rule of law, but is only permissible inference in the absence of an

indication to the contrary. "

"The ejusdem generis rule is one to be applied with caution and not pushed too

far ... .... To invoke the application of the ejusdem generis rule, there must be a

distinct genus or category. The specific words must apply not to different subjects

of a widely differing character but to something which can be called a class or

kind of objects. Where this is lacking, the rule cannot apply, but the mention of a

single species does not constitute a genus. " (Craies on Statute Law, 6th Ed.,

p.l8l)

Section 47 of the Act contemplates one or more orders which could be

made by the Council. The Appellant, a registered surveyor was found guilty of

professional misconduct after a formal inquiry. In terms of Section 47(f), the

Council is empowered to make "any other appropriate order as, to costs or

otherwise as the council considers appropriate ". Therefore, the Council is

-empowered to make an order for costs, in terms of the Act. The submission of the

learned State Counsel IS that "or otherwise" preceding the word "as to costs", be

read as comprehending only to orders of the same kind related to costs, in other

words, the generic term "otherwise' should be construed in the same genus and/or

category "as to costs" and to that extend the specific word costs, be given a

restrictive interpretation.

In Sollli Eduljee Captain Vs. Commissioner of Inlaml Revenue, S.C. 2/73-

Income Tax case BRAlBTT/3, Wijayatilake J. cited with approval the case of

National Association of Local Government Officers Vs. Bolton Corporation

1943 A.C 166 at page 176, where it was held that "the use of the words 'or

otherwise' does not bring into play the ejusdem generis principle, for 'manual

labour' and 'clerical work' do not belong to a single limited genus. The ejusdem

generis doctrine is by no means an absolute one, and i/it can be seenJrom a wider

inspection of the scope of the legislation that the general words ought to be

construed generally, they are so construed notwithstanding that they follow more

particular expressions. The wording of the statute may also show that the general

language is to be construed generally. "

Maxwell on the Interpretation of statutes, 12''' Edition, at page 297, states

that, "in the abstract, general words, like all others, receive their fitll and natural

meaning, and the courts will not impose on them limitations not called (or bv the

sense or obiects o(the enactment. "(The emphasis is mine)

In Rallulan Vs. Attorney General CA. 10112002, the Court, in order to.

achieve the objectives of the legislation, attached the widest possible meaning to

the long title and the provisions of the statute.

The Court is entitled to look at the long title of the Act in order to ascertain the

ends and purposes which Parliament had intended to achieve through that

legislation. It is quite permissible for the Courts to use the long title to ascertain

Page 7 of 13

the clear and unambiguous meaning of a section. If a section is ambiguous the

long title may also be consulted to discover the intention of Parliament in order to

resolve an ambiguity. (Maersk (Lanka) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Minister of Ports and

Aviation ami Others, (2012) 1 SLR 9)

The exceptions to the rule of ejusdem generis may in the words of Francis

J. McCaffrey, be stated as below:

1. If the preceding term is general, as weLL as that which foLLows, the

doctrine can have no application.

2. When the particular and specific words exhaust the whole genus, there

is nothing ejusdem generis left, and the general words foLLowing must be

given a meaning outside the class designated by the particular words.

3. There is no place of the rule to apply where the specificaLLy enumerated

objects are essentiaLLy diverse in character. 1n this situation the

meaning of the general term remains unaffected by its connection with

the preceding particular terms and it is given its natural meaning.

4. The general term shaLL not be restricted in meaning by the specific

words with which it is associated if the legislative intent is plain to the

contrary, Such intent may be gathered from the general object of an Act,

its legislative history, the context, Acts in pari materia, and other

recognized sources of assistance.

The preamble of the Survey Act reads as follows;

"An Act to provide for the powers and jimctions of the Surveyor-General; to

regulate the carrying out of the land Surveys; to provide for the establishment of a

land Survey Council to regulate the professional conduct of Surveyors; to repeal

the land Surveys ordinance and the Surveyors; and to provide for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto. "

In AG Vs. Prince Ernest A ugustlls of Hanover 1957Al 436, Lord Norm

observed that "where there is a preamble it is generally in its recitals that the

mischief to be remedied and the scope of the Act are described. It is therefore

clearly permissible to have recourse to it as an aid to construing the enacting

provisions. The courts are concerned with the practical business of deciding a lis;

and when the plaintiff puts forward one construction of an enactment and the

defendant another, it is the courts business in any case of some difficulty, after

informing itself of what 1 have called the legal and factual context including the

preamble, to consider in the light of this knowledge whether the enacting words

admit of both the rival constructions put forward. If they admit of only one

construction, that construction will receive effect even if it is inconsistent with the

preamble, but if the enacting words are capable of either of the constructions

offered by the parties, the construction which fits the preamble may be preferred. "

When considering the long title of the Act, one of the main objectives of

this statute was "to provide for the establishment of a land Survey Council to

Page 9 of 13

regulate the professional conduct of Surveyors. At the formal inquiry held in terms

of Section 45(1) (c) (ii) (A) of the Act, the Council came to a finding that the

contested plan bearing No. 5220 was defective and therefore, determined that the

Appellant had discharged his professional duties contrary to the said provision of

the Act, which amounts to professional misconduct. The Council was well within

its statutory I imits, when making such order.

The Appellant is dissatisfied with an order made by the Council regarding

his professional conduct. A party aggrieved by an order in terms of Section 47

subsection (I) (a) to (e) and! or under subsection (f) to make any other order as, to

costs or otherwise as the Counci I considers appropriate, can appeal against such

decision in terms of Section 49 of the Act. In the circumstances, if the

interpretation to the generic and! or not specific term "otherwise" is to be ejusdem

generis "to costs", it would certainty narrow and/ or limit the scope of an inquiry

into the professional conduct of a Surveyor, which would be contrary to the

intendment of the enacted provision. The purpose of the legislation, inter alia, was

to regulate the professional conduct of the surveyors. Therefore, a restrictive

interpretation to the generic term "otherwise", in my view would defeat the wider

scope and application to deal with surveyors found guilty of professional

misconduct.

[ am of the view that, the interpretation of the generic term "or otherwise"

In Section 47( I )(f), should not be restricted "to costs" but to have a wider

Page 10 of 13

construction which fulfils the general object of the statute and accordingly, I find

that the ejusdem generis principle does not apply in this case.

The Appellant has urged to set aside the decision of the Council dated

25109/20 17, marked I, on the basis that;

"the 2nd Respondent- Council has failed to carry out the inquiry in accordance

with the law, without following the basic principles of natural justice,

that the Appellant was not given a fair hearing and not allowed to submit his

defence in person or through his representatives required by Section 46 (4) of the

Act. "

The main contention of the Appellant is that when making its order the

Council failed to carry out the inquiry according to law and is contrary to the

principles of natural justice.

In Gregory Fernando and others Vs. Stanley Perera, Acting Principle,

Christ The King National School and others, (2004) 1 SLR 346), Sri Pavan J. (as

he then was) held, that;

"It is vital that fairness demands that a person whose rights would be adversely

affected must be given an opportunity for a fair hearing. One would not go to the

merits of a case withoUI hearing necessary parties. "

By letter dated 05/07/2017, (at page 212 of the brief) the Appellant was

informed to be present before the Council on 21 /07/2017, for a formal inquiry.

Page 11 of 13

The said letter also informed the Appellant to bring along all documents and plans

relevant to the complaint.

Section 46 of the Act clearly states the manner in which the inquiry should

be held by the Counci l. The Appellant states that he was not given a fair hearing

and was not allowed to submit his defence through his reprcsentatives as required

by Section 48 of the Act. It is observed that by letter dated 13/07/2017, marked

'G', the Appellant has informed the Council that he considers it appropriate for the

Council to call his client and also an Attorney at Law, who has been identified by

name, to participate at the said inquiry. However, there was no request by the

Appellant to call witnesses or to present evidence in any manner before the

Council, which was turned down, as alleged. The Council having gone into the

merits of the case has given reasons, before arriving at its conclusions.

With reference to the said inquiry, the Appellant by a letter addressed to the

Council, dated 21 /07/2017, has acknowledged the right of the Council to take an

appropriate decision in terms of Section 47 of the Act. However, after a lapse of

over 2 months, by letter dated 24/09/2017, the Appellant complains about the

procedural impropriety of the said inquiry.

By the said letter dated 21 /07/2017, the Appellant, of his own accord,

informed the Council that he was awaiting the determination of the inquiry, and

did not put in issue any violation of his rights or any procedural irregularity when

Page 12 of 13

conducting the said inquiry. Therefore, agreeing to abide by the said decision of

the Council, the Appellant has waived his right to object, by his own conduct.

The Council when considering the merits of this case observed that the

Appellant was not certain whether the complainant-Respondent, who owns the

land was present at the time, the survey was conducted. The Appellant was also

unable to explain as to why the said survey was conducted at the request of a

lawyer and has also failed to explain that the land surveyed by him belonged to his

client who had title to Lot No.2. Therefore, taking into consideration the totality

of the evidence available, 1 do not see any reason to interfere with the

determination of the Council dated 25/09/2017.

For all the above reasons, the Appeal is dismissed without costs.
