10.l2.2018 by the Respondent. 16.05.2018, 28.06.2019 by the Accused Appellant

06.08.2019

01. I st Accused Appellant (Appellant) and the 2nd Accused were indicted in the

High Court of Balapitiya. Out of the 3 counts in the indictment, count

No.OI was against both Appellant and the 2nd Accused, and counts No. 02

and 03 were against the Appellant. On 27.04.2017, the indictment was

served on both Appellant and the 2nd Accused, and both pleaded not guilty

to the charges. Both accused persons have moved for postponements on

several occasions to consider the possibility of tendering a plea of guilty,

and on 26.09.2017, both accused persons have not come to Court. On

2

27.09.2017 both accused surrendered to Court by way ofa motion filed by

counsel and moved Court to withdraw the earlier plea and to plead guilty.

Upon reading and explaining the charges in the indictment to the Appellant

and the 2nd Accused, they pleaded guilty to their respective charges. The

learned High Court Judge after convicting the Appellant and the 2nd

Accused on their own plea of guilty, sentenced both accordingly.

02. On count No. 03, the charge against the Appellant was having in possession

of a gun in contravention of Section 22( I) read with Section 22(3) of the

Fire Arms Ordinance and the learned High Court Judge sentenced him to

imprisonment for life. Being aggrieved by the said sentence of

imprisonment for life on count No.03, the Appellant preferred the instant

appeal.

03. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that, the charge did not specify the gun

the Appellant was in possession and therefore the charge is misleading.

Appellant pleaded guilty expecting a lenient punishment, he submitted.

04. Section 22(1) of the Firearms Ordinance provides;

'No person shall have in his custody, or possess or use, any gun, unless he shall hold a licence therefore in accordance with this

Ordinance (herein referred to as a gun licence). '

05. The penal section (Section 22(3)) as amended by Act No.22 of 1996

provides;

3

'(3) Any person contravening the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence against this Ordinance and shall on conviction be punishable-

(a)for the first offence with afine not exceeding ten thousand rupees

or with rigorous imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or with both such fine and imprisonment; (b)for the second or any subsequent offence. with rigorous imprisonment for a period not less than 10 years and not exceeding 20 years;

Provided that where the offence consists of having the custody or possession of, or of using, an automatic gun or repeater shot gun, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for life; ... '

06. Count No. 03 in the indictment clearly specifies the penal section as

"punishable under section 22(3) to be read with section 22(1) of the

Firearms Ordinance n.

07. Indictment contains the I ist of productions that the prosecution intends to

produce and also the list of witnesses that the prosecution intends to call.

No.OI and No.03 in the list of productions are, a gun, and a government

analyst report, respectively. They are not only disclosed to the defence by

the prosecution, but also copies are handed over to the Accused with the

indictment. Government analyst report that was disclosed clearly specifies

that the gun sent for analysis is a T56 Automatic Rifle. Counsel had

appeared for the Appellant in the High Court. During the sentencing

submissions in the High Court, State Counsel had clearly stated about the

automatic gun that was in possession of the Appellant and also the

prescribed punishment by law. Counsel for the Appellant never disputed the

same. Therefore, the contention of the counsel that the Appellant was

4

misled as the charge did not specifY the gun, is untenable. Possessing any

gun without a licence is an offence in terms of section 22(1). When it

comes to sentencing, section 22(3) applies and that was clearly mentioned

in the charge. I am of the view that the Appellant was not misled by the

charge as mentioned before. It has not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant.

08. Counsel for the Appellant in his written submissions filed on 28.06.2019,

after the oral arguments, submitted that the learned Trial Judge failed to

satisfY himself that the Appellant rightly comprehended the effect of his

plea, and therefore had not followed the procedure laid down in section 197

of the Criminal Procedure Code.

09. The journal entry dated 27.09.2017 clearly demonstrates that the leamed

Trial Judge had read and explained the charges to the Appellant. Further, as

I explained before in paragraph 01 of the judgment, when considering the

sequence of events that had taken place between 27.04.2017 and

27.09.2017, it is clear that the Appellant was well aware of what he was

charged for. It was on application by his own counsel that the charges were

again read and explained to the Appellant on 27.09.2017, at which point the

Appellant pleaded guilty. Therefore, the contention above by the counsel

for the Appellant is untenable.

10. Counsel for the Appellant further contended that, however, the sentence

imposed by the learned Trial Judge is excessive. Inviting the attention of

the Court to S.C. Appeal No. 17/20 13 and S.C. Reference 03/2008, counsel

submitted that notwithstanding the prescribed minimum mandatory

5

sentence, learned High COUlt Judge should have imposed a lenient sentence

in the given circumstance.

II. Decided cases from the Superior Courts that the Counsel for the Appellant

invited the attention of this Court are, cases of sexual offences where young

offenders got involved with underage victims with consent. Circumstances

of those cases are quite different to this case. This is a case where the

Appellant possessed a T56 automatic gun without a licence. Committing

serious offences including murder and robbery using automatic guns are

very prevalent in this country. Court has to take serious cognizance of that

fact in sentencing such offenders. Intention of the legislature is clear when

the amendment was brought in the year 1996, to the Fire Arms Ordinance,

prescribing severe sentences. The mitigatory factors mentioned on behalf of

the Appellant are more of personal in nature, and I do not see any reason to

deviate from the mandatory sentence prescribed by law. Therefore, I see no

reason to interfere with the mandatory sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
