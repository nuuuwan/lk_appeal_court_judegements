PLAINTIFF;RESPONDENT

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j

Manohara Desilva PC with Pubudum Wickramaratne for the Defendants Appellants

Harsha Soza PC Walgampaya . for Respondent

10.12.2018

with the Upendra Plaintiff

The Plaintiff; Respondent in this case was given at the end of the trial an 8 feet

right of way over the land of the Defendant--Appellant, in order to access his land:

The Defendant; Appellant Impugns this grant of 8 feet on the basis that a previous

partition action (DC Kandy P /7050) had resulted in the grant of only a 3 feet right

of way and this previous decree operates as a res judicata and the widening of the

right of way to a 8 feet cart way could not have been granted in the 2nd action;

which is the current action.

2

In the previous Partition Action bearing No. P/70S0 of the District Court of

Kandy, the plaintiff's predecessor in title Pathirana Wanigasekara had purchased

the dominant tenant as the 2nd added Defendant in the aforesaid partition suit.

The said dominant tenant which is depicted as Lot No.7 in the preliminary Plan

bearing No.1049 was excluded, when the trial had come up on 18.03.1970, upon

an agreement that the Plaintiff confined the corpus to be partitioned to Lots 1 to

6. It was recorded by way of a settlement that a right of way to Lot 7, in favour of

the 1st and 2nd added Defendant~ Appellants (predecessors in title f the Plaintiff in

this case) was reserved and thereafter the 1st and 2nd added Defendants had been

discharged from the case and they had also been awarded costs.

The interlocutory decree dated 30.07.1970 ordered that Lot 7 were excluded but

the added Defendants who owned Lot 7 were given a right of way from the main

road. The right of way straddled the lands of the Plaintiffs in that case (who

become Defendants in the,~nd case). The interlocutory decree also discharged the

added Defendants and they were ordered to be paid costs.

It was further ordered and decreed that the land and premises should be sold by

auction among the co~owners and the proceed divided.

Roadway reduced to 3 feet

The interlocutory decree only described a roadway. It 'did not mention a width.

It is only in the order dated 26.11.2976 that the learned District Judge had decided.

that the added DefendanL would be entitled to a road"ay of 3 feet width~see V8

at p. 4 34 of the brief.

Moving away from the introductory matrix, let me start from the beginning.

The Plaintiff~ Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") by a

plaint dated 07.01.1993 filf~d this current action against the pt to 5th Defendant~

Appellants (hereinafter s6metimes referred to as "the rsr, 2nd, yd, 4th and 5th

Defendants") praying, inter alia,:~

3

I';

(a) for a declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to the 10 foot wide road

way described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint and entitled to drive

vehicles over the said roadway to access the land and premises

described in the pt schedule to the plaint;

(b) as the Plaintiff has no other means of access to the land described in the

1 st schedule to the plaint, a permanent injunction preventing the

Defendants from obstructing the said road way and for an interim

injunction and, an enjoining order in lik(~ manner until the said

permanent injunction is issued;

(c) as the said righ!~ of way over the said road\vay described in the 2nd

schedule to the:,plaint is a right of way of necessity for an interim

injunction directing the removal of the obstructions placed by the

Defendant on the said road way.

The Defendants filed answer dated 17.03.1993 (at page 72) and prayed, inter alia.

for a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action, for a declaration that the Plaintiff is

entitled to the user of a right of way of 3 feet as declared in Case No. P/7050, and

for damages in a sum of ~s50,000(.

The Plaintiff by replication dated 16.09.1993 (page 75) demined the counter claim

of the Defendants and sought a dismissal of the said counter claim.

The trial commenced on 29.04.1994 (page 81) and . the parties framed their

respective issued. Howe"/cr, when the case came up (in 22.03.1995 both parties

moved to record admissib~l and issues afresh and the le,lrned trial Judge allowed

the said joint application? The parties recorded 2 admissions and the Plaintiff

framed issues 1 to 8 while the Defendants framed issues 9 to 31 (page 87). After

the said issues were framed the Plaintiff's Counsel moved to amend the plaint

and the learned trial Judge allowed the said application.

,I Rajapaksa and they gifted the same to their son, the Plaintiff, on Deed

No.l4092 dated 18.06.1990 who became entitled to the said land

described in the yt schedule to the plaint and the right of way described

in the 2nd schedule to the plaint to access the sciid land;

(ix) The Plaintiff and his predecessors in title have by user of the said road

way for over 10 years acquired prescriptive rights to use the said road

way;

(x) Case No.70S0/P vlhs instituted seeking to partition the land described in

the yd schedule v>11ich is adjoining the Plaintiff's land describe in the pt

schedule and the Plaintiff in the said action had wrongfully included the

Plaintiff's land as part of the corpus in the said partition action;

(xi) The Plaintiff's predecessor in title, the said E.P.P. Wanigasekera,

intervened in the said partition action nay by order dated 30.07.1970

obtained an exclvsion of the land described in the pt schedule to the

plaint from the corpus in the said action;

(xii) In the said partition action the corpus consisted of Lots Nos.1 to 6 in the

said Plan No.1049 )vide page 419) and Lots Nos. 2, 3 and 5 therein

consisted of the 10 foot road way in question (described in the 2nd

schedule to the amended plaint) along which the Plaintiff in the present

plaint; ]".

(xiii) The Plaintiff in the said partition action sougllt to reduce the width of

right of way leading to the Plaintiff's land described in the pt schedule to the

plaint. Iii

jt.; The Defendants by Statement of Objections dated 17.05.1995 (page 77) objected

to the said amended plaint stating that the Plaintiff is guilty of laches and moved

for the said amended plaint to be rejected.

The learned trial Judgel:-:,y his order dated 14.07.1995 (page 93) allowed the

amended plaint subject to costs.

The Defendants thereafter Filed amended answer dated 15.08.1995 (page 68) once

again praying for a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action, for a declaration that the

7

Plaintiff is entitled to the user of a right of way of 3 feet as declared in Case No.

Pi7050 and for damages in a sum of Rs.50,000i~. It was pleaded in the said

amended answer, inter alia, that by Order in Case No.7050iP dated 20.11.1976 the

learned District Judge had restricted the right of way in question to a width of 3

feet and the writ of possession in Case No.7050iP had been executed on or about

27.10.1992 demarcating thr:: right of way as been 3 feet in width.

The plaintiff filed Replication dated 12.09.1995 (page 79) seeking a dismissal of

the claim in reconvention prayed for by the Defendants in the said amended

answer.

The trial commenced afresh on 25.03.1997 (page 96) with the Plaintiff framing

issues 1 to 15. The Defenda'nts objected to issues 3, 4, 5,9 and 10 framed on behalf

of the Plaintiff and the lec1tned trial Judge overruled the said objection by order

dated 08.07.1997 (page 101). The defendant framed his issues on 08.097.1997

(page 103) as Issues Nos, 16 to 30.

Therefore, the trial proceeded on Issues Nos. 1 to 15 framed by the Plaintiff on

25.03.1997 (page 96) and Issues Nos. 16 to 30 framed by the Defendants on

08.07.1997 (page 103). (I

One Kalukotuwegedera @unasena (pages 106 to 110) (Administrative Officer

from the Kandy Municipal Council), one Srimathie Rajapaksa (pages 119 to 207)

(the mother and power 01 attorney holder of the Plaintiff), one Hector Navaratne

(pages 208 and 214) (Licensed Surveyor and court Commissioner), one Alfrious

Ian Jayatilake (pages 214 to 229) and M.R.M. Gunar~tne Banda (pages 229 to

235) (Grama Niladhari of Velata Division) testified on behalf of the Plaintiff

marking in evidence docmpent a~1 to a~17.

The 4th Defendant (pages 235 to 281), one Chithrasome Adihettie (pages 282 to

285) (Licensed Surveyor. and Court Commissioner), ope Satyavel Balakrishnan

(pages 286 to 291) and one Anula Disnayake (pages 291 to 294) (nominee of the

, ! 8

\ 1

registrar of the District, Court of Kandy) gave evidence in support of the

Defendants' case and marked in evidence documents en to E)ll.

The evidence in the case

When the house on Lot 7 in Plan No.1049 (vide page 392 and 419) was

constructed, the said 10 feet roadway has been shown to the Kandy Municipal

Council as the access road~vide pages 107~1l0. Srimathie Rajapaksa is the

Plaintiff's mother. In the'course of her evidence she produced Plan No.441 of

07.04.1959~ez;4 (page369)'which shows the said acce'ss road off the Colombo~

Kandy road from the point shown as Peradeniya Road to the Plaintiff's property-

videez:2 at page 363.

Srimathie Rajapaksa in t he course of her evidence produced the relevant title

deeds, viz., Deeds Nos.2569 (ez;3) (page 365), 2571 (ez;5) (page 370), 833 (ez;6)

(page 374), 876, (ez;7) (page 378), 831 (ez;8) (page 382), 4040 (ez:9) (page 386),

and 14092 (ez;10) (page 388)~vide also Deed No.4041 (en) at page 414. All these

title deeds confirm the sakI right of way which is claimed by the Plaintiff. In Plan

No.1049 (ez;ll) and (E)3) (pages 392, 419) the said roadways is shown as Lots 2, 3

and 5.

Srimathie Rajapaksa produced the aforesaid title documents to establish the

Plaintiff's entitlement to the dominant tenement which is the said Lot 7, and the

servient tenement over \\r~ch the servitude of way exists which the Plaintiff is

seeking t broaden out of sheer necessity.

Srimathie Rajapaksa testified that when they purchased the property in suit in

1989 the said roadway existed just as it has previously existed as shown in Plan

No.441 of 07.04.1959 (ez;4) (page 369)~videpage 124. The same roadway is shown

in Plan No.1040 of 03.04.l969 (ez;ll and E)3) (pages 392 and 419)~vide also Plan

No.1462 (E)2) at page 418. j,

h

Srimathie Rajapaksa's husband Dr. Reginton Rajapaksa's was a professor in the

Peradeniya University, and Srimathie Rajapaksa was a lecturer, and they

occupied their official residence in the campus. By Deed No.14092 (az;lO) of

]8.07.1990 (page 388) Srimathie Rajapaksa and her husband Dr. Reginton

Rajapaksa gifted the said property to their son the Plaintiff together with the

said right of way to the s(1;d house.

According to SrimathieRajapaksa's evidence after she and her husband Dr.

Reginton Rajapaksa purchased the said property in 1989 by Deed No.4040 of

22.06.1989 (az;9) (page 386) her husband Dr. Reginton had used his car over the

said roadway to access the said house. There had been an old house on the said

property at the time it was purchased by Dr. Reginton and Srimathie Rajapaksa-

vide pages 139-140. When ,~hey used the said roadway to access the house by car

there had been no protest ,from any quarter.

Dr. Reginton and Srimathie Rajapaksa had prior to purchase of the said property

gone by car over the said roadway to see the said property. It has transpired in

evidence that the said house had been let to one Nir. Dissanayake and one Mr~

Wijeratne-vide page 125. They too had used their vehicle over the said roadway

to access the said house. /cHter these twp tenants left, the house had been let to

the Timber Corporation,f and it was then that th~ 4th Defendant-Ananda

Dharmawardena had fixed a concrete post to obstruct vehicular passage along

the said roadway. Srimanhie Rajapaksa has complained to the Kandy Police-vide

az;12 at page 393. Thereafter, there was a Primary Court Case, and the Defendants

were ordered to remove the concrete post-vide Primary Court Case az;13 dated

21.05.1992, az;14 and az;15~ages 394 to 401). The result of this dispute was that

the tenant reduced the re:r~t to Rs.1,OOO/-, and eventually left. As at the date of

az;12, namely, 20.01.1992 the house was unoccupied. If there is no right of

vehicular passage, the aid premises are of no use to the Plaintiff-vide page 128. The

, (

\, :

r

10

Plaintiff would face numerous difficulties if no vehicular passage could be had to

the said house.

Not long after the said order of the Primary Court, however, it would appear that

the final decree in D.C. Kandy Case No.7050/P had been executed, and the width

of the disputed roadway had been restricted to 3 feet-vide pages 139, 140, 147, 148

and 149 and final decree E>6 in D.C. Kandy Case No.7050/P at pages 425, 426 and

427; vide also pages 431, 432, 433 and 434 to 437. It would seem that by order of

the District Court of Kandy dated 26.11.1976 (E)8 pages 434 to 437) in D.C. Kandy

Case No.7050/P the disppted roadway has been restricted to a 3 feet wide

roadway by consent apparently given by some oversight.

The said 3 feet wide road'Nay is shown in the final partition Plan No.595 in D.C.

Kandy Case No.7050/P (E)5 at page 424). The final partition decree is dated

27.08.1989 (page 427), and it has been implemented on 27.10.1992-vide page 43l.

It will be observed that these events have taken place after Dr. Reginton and

Srimathie Rajapaksa purchased the said property by Deed No.4040 on

22.06.1989 (al9 at page 386). In fact the evidence of Srimathie Rajapaksa at pages

148,149,177,180 is that she came to know of the said final decree in D.C. Kandy

Case No.7050/P only during the course of the proceeding in the said Primary

Court Case.

The Timber Corporation:lficial who was occupying the house had not objected

to the execution of the w~r-tOvide page 245. The 4th Defendant had not accepted

-,'it -the Plaintiff's position tha-c they used a 10 feet wide roadway-vide page 247. The

4th Defendant states in evidence that if there is a 10 feet wide roadway they will

not be able to open out their windows-vide page 250.

Ian Jayatilake, a close relative of the Plaintiff's predecessor-in-title, testified that

as far as he knows vehiclc:s have gone over the roadway in question-vide page 126:

Grama Niladhari Gunara6~'e Banda who has worked in the said area around 1993

said he has personal knmvledge of the dispute in this case. He said in evidence

11

n that vehicles could have g?ne over the roadway in question~vide page 231. Even

the 4th Defendant admitted that a small car could go over a 10 feet wide roadway

but nor over a 3 feet wide roadway~vide page 272. He conceded that in certain

occasions the use of vehicles is necessary~vide page 273.

After the conclusion of the trial the parties tendered their respective writen

submissions. Thereafter tt ~.~ learned Additional District Judge of Kandy delivered

judgment dated 14.01.2009 (page 295) granting the Plaintiff a right of way of

necessity which is 8 feet in width.

In a nutshell the learned Additional District Judge held as follows>

(i) When comparing the right of way depicted as Lot No.2 in plan marked

as E)5 (Plan No.595 page 424) with the right of way depicted as Lots

Nos.2 and 3 in plat\ marked ol;ll (Plan No.l049 pages 392 and 410) there

is no doubt that l~e right of way depicted in plan marked ol;ll is much

wider than the 3 feet roadway depicted in plan marked E)S.

(ii) The interlocutoI} decree (ol;16 page 402) in Case No.7050/P does not set

out the width oh:he said right of way leading up to the Plaintiff's land.

(iii) After and inquiry' held into the width of the said right of way in Case

No.70S0/P the sai~right of way has been reduced to a width of 3 feet by

order dated 26.11}976 (E)8 page 434). The width of the said roadway has

not been restricted to 3 feet in a proper assessment of the evidentiary

material in the aid order dated 26.11.1976 marked E)8 (pages 434, 436,

437).

(iv) Conditions may change later, and a wider roadway would become a

necessity. . j'

j: " (v) The doctrine of res judicata has no application iri this case.

12

.,

, !.

(vi) The fact that there is an order of Court restricting the right of way to a

width of 3 feet is not bar on the Plaintiff to institute an action at a later

stage for the said right of way of necessity to be widened depending on

the necessity at the time~ Boteju v. Abilinu Singho 7 CWR 36~vide page

335.

(vii) Evidence proves that prior to the obstruction by the Defendants the right

of way was wide enough to access the Plaintiff's land by car~vide Plan

No.441~Ol;4 and Plan No.l040~Ol;1l; that by Deeds ol;5 to ol;10 it is the

wider roadway shown in Plan No.441~ol;4 which has been conveyed~vide

pages 304, 308, 3Hl, 311.

(Viii) That even after the restriction of the said rbadway to a 3 feet wide

roadway the wider roadway has been used without opposition~vide

pages 312~ 314; even the Defendants' witness Balakrishnan confirmed this

fact in evidence~v~de pages 286, 315.

(ix) That the dispute ::l'rose because a concrete post was fixed to prevent user

.J of the wider roadway~vide page 314.

(x) Court was satisfied that prior to D.C. Kandy Case No.7050/P the wider

roadway existed~vide page 315; that even after the final decree in the said

Case No.7050/P tJ.e winder roadway has been used.

(xi) Considering that a two~storied house has been constructed on the said

premises, a right ~f vehicular passage thereto is a necessity.

(xii) Court in the circumstances considered that an 8 feet wide roadway

should be given to the Plaintiff, and accordingly entered a 'decree giving

the Plaintiff an 8 feet wide roadway on the ground of necessity.

13

Being aggrieved by the ;:aid judgment of the District Court of Kandy the

Defendant'Appellants has preferred this appeal seeking, inter alia, to have the

said judgment set aside.

In my view the learned Additional District Judge brought to bear on his

assessment of evidence tbe facts and circumstances of this case and concluded

that there was necessitv that made the grant of an 8 feet wide roadway

imperative. s.

In fact it has to be recalled that until the said roadway was restricted to a 3 feet

wide roadway by the final decree in the said D.C. Kandy Case No.7050/P, the

roadway in question was c. much wider roadway than a 3 feet wide roadway. The

Plan Nos.441 of 07.04.1959 (el:4 page 369) and 1040 (oz:ll and!)3 pages 392 and

419) together with the ntle el:5 to edO all point to this fact and it must be

observed that the learned,l\.dditional District Judge has taken into account this

fact. Even the roadway shown in Plan No.1049 (el:Jl) and (!)5) which is the

preliminary plan in D.C. Kandy Case No.7050/P shovls a much wider roadway

than a 3 feet wider roadway. So there was ample evidence before the learne~

Additional District Judge that when the property was purchased by Dr

Reginton and Srimathie Rajapaksa in 1989, the said roadway both physically, and

l . in terms of the documentE, of title was a much wider roadway than a 3 feet wide

l '. roadway, and that vehicles passed and repassed down that roadway without let

or hindrance.

It cannot be gainsaid that even after the final partition decree in the said Cas~

No.7050/P wherein the said roadway was restricted to a 3 feet wide roadway, the

said roadway in dispute continued to be used as a much wider roadway until

January, 1992 when th~ .;4th Defendant fixed a concrete post to prevent the

passage of vehicles on the~"aid roadway.

Even though the preliminary Plan No.1049 (el:ll and !)3) in the said Case

No.7050/P did not show the 3 feet wide road, but rather showed a much wider

14

road, and there was no iss'~e, or evidence or adjudication regarding the matter in

the said partition case, it would appeal that the matter ,was raised at a later stage

upon a motion after entry of the interlocutory decree, and the order dated

1 26.11.1976 (E>8 page 434) had been made apparently on the basis of consent given

for the restriction of the said roadway to a 3 feet wide roadway-vide pages 303,

308. The learned Additional District Judge has consiJered these matters, and

taken the view that there is nothing, however, to preclude the Plaintiff from now

claiming a wider roadway to take vehicles to the dominant tenement. This

conclusion reached by th~ learned trial Judge is unassailable and as was held in

the case of Boteju v. Abijil1u Singho (1979) 7 CWR 36, the previous case cannot

.~ ~ be res judicata as was submitted on behalf of the Defendant-Appellant in this case.

The learned District Judge arrives at the conclusion that if the road existed as a

3 feet wide road, it would have been unnecessary to suddenly fix a concrete post

on the said roadway-vide page 315. The learned Judge has also considered the fact

that there is a two-storey building on the dominant tenement, and that access

thereto by vehicle could b~ considered to be a necessity. The wider road after all

physically existed at the time the property was purchased by Dr. Reginton and

Srimathi Rajapaksa. I quite agree with the submissions made that the wider

roadway was a servitude which appertained to the property. I

The condition of the dominant tenement, the original physical state of the

roadway, the manner in which the roadway has been used are all relevant

considerations when an aG;don is filed for broadening of an existing right of way

on the ground of necessity-vide the cases of Boteju v. Abi]inu Singho (1979) 7
