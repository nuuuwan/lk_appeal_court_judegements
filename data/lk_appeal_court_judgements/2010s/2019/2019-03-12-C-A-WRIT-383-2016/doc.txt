Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Jinaprith Fernando for the Petitioner.

Virum de Abrew, Senior D.S.G., for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 11.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

certiorari the determination of the Commissioner of Labour

marked P5 whereby the petitioner was asked to pay a sum of Rs.

98,700/= as Employee Provident Fund contribution to the 3rd

respondent, and to compel the Commissioner of Labour by way

of mandamus to refund the said sum deposited with the

Commissioner (P10).

The only question to be decided is whether or not the 3rd

respondent is an employee of the petitioner to be entitled to

claim EPF from the latter.

The petitioner says that it is a company incorporated under the

laws of Sri Lanka and is a part of the International Non-

Governmental OrganizationWorld Vision International, which

has several community development projects initiated in Sri

Lanka.

According to the petitioner such community development

projects are carried out through the Government Agent of the

area with the help of the Community Based Organizations.

According to the 3rd respondent (vide 1R1), World Vision

International has started development programs in the village

3

relevant to this case through Bogahawawe Grama Sanwardhena

Samithiya, and she, along with others, has implemented the

programs of the World Vision International on a monthly

allowance (not salary) paid by the Grama Sanwardhena

Samithiya.

The contention of the 3rd respondent is her monthly allowance

was paid by the Grama Sanwardhena Samithiya out of the funds

allocated to the Grama Sanwardhena Samithiya by the World

Vision International.

As seen from 1R2, issued by the former Chairman of the Grama

Sanwardhena Samithiya, not only these allowances, all the

moneys for development activities in the village have been paid

out of the moneys credited by the World Vision International to

the Grama Sanwardhena Samithiya.

The World Vision International being a Non-Governmental

Organization is doing some benevolent/voluntary work to uplift

the living standard of the villagers.

The petitioner (World Vision Lanka (Guarantee) Limited) has not

recruited the 3rd respondent as an employee to carry out their

projects. If at all, she has been recruited by the Grama

Sanwardhena Samithiya although her monthly allowances have

been paid out of the funds released by the petitioner to the

Samithiya. There is no formal Letter of Appointment issued to

the 3rd respondent either by the petitioner or the Grama

Sanwardhena Samithiya. According to 1R1, that monthly

allowance is also not a handsome amountstarted at Rs.2500/=

and ended at Rs.8000/=. The petitioner has not supervised her

4

work. In short, the petitioner has had no control over the 3rd

respondent.

It is the position of the petitioner that the petitioner has a staff

of around 516 throughout the country, and the petitioner pays

EPF to those employees. The petitioner further says that there

may be several hundreds of people employed by Community

Based Organizations such as Bogahawawe Grama

Sanwardhena Samithiya to carry out their projects, and if the

3rd respondents request is allowed, everybody who has

contributed to carry out development activities in the villages

would make similar applications.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear that there

had not been any employer-employee relationship between the

petitioner and the 3rd respondent.

The reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer

to the petition are granted.

Application allowed. No costs.
