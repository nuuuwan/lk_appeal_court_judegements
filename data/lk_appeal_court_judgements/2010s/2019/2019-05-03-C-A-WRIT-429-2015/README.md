Decided on: 02.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner as the liquidator of Dart West Asia Holdings (Pvt)

Ltd. filed this application seeking to quash by way of certiorari

the decision P5 made by the Commissioner General of Labour

directing the Managing Director of the said company to pay EPF

and Gratuity to the 3rd respondent-a former employee of the said

company.

At the argument learned Senior DSG for the respondent inter

alia took up a preliminary objection regarding standing of the

petitioner to file this application.

In the 1st paragraph of the petition, although the petitioner gives

the impression to Court that the said company is presently

under liquidation, the petitioner in paragraphs 32-34 has stated

with supporting documents P20-P22 that winding up procedure

is now concluded and Final Account of the liquidator has also

been sent to the Registrar General of Companies.

From those documents it is clear that, it was a voluntary

winding up of the company, and P22 is the Final Accounts sent

3

by the liquidator to the Registrar General of Companies under

section 331(3) of the Companies Act, No.7 of 2007 on or around

16.06.2015 after the affairs of the company were fully wound up

and Final General Meeting was held.

In terms of section 331(4) of the Companies Act, the Registrar

General of Companies upon receiving the Final Accounts shall

forthwith register them and on the expiration of three months

from the date of the registration of them, the company is

dissolved automatically.

It is clear that this application has been filed by the petitioner

several months after the company is dissolved on the purported

basis that he is still the liquidator of the company.

The petitioner has no locus standi to file this application.

Application is dismissed with costs.
