Plaintiffs-Respondents.

Decided on: 23.10.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of

Colombo naming four defendants, but seeking reliefs only

against the 1st defendant, the Attorney-General, basically

challenging the order of the Sri Lanka Customs made on

22.10.1992 whereby the textile material relevant to this case

3

was forfeited and a penalty of Rs. 10.8 million on the 2nd

defendant company and Rs. 100,000 each on the 2nd plaintiff,

the 3rd and 4th defendants as directors of the said company were

imposed. The forfeiture of textile material has taken place and

the penalties have been paid.

This order by the Customs has been made after due inquiry, in

which, during the investigation period as well as at the customs

inquiry, several prominent counsel have appeared for the alleged

preparators.1

This action has been filed in the District Court by the two

plaintiffs as shareholders of the 2nd defendant company in the

nature of a (Common Law) derivative action for and on behalf of

the company on the basis that the 3rd and 4th defendants have

acted in their own personal interest in respect of the subject

matter of this action set out hereinafter causing wrongful loss to

the 2nd defendant company and its shareholders including the

plaintiffs.2 In paragraph 6 they further state that the plaintiffs

apprehend and have reason to apprehend that the 3rd and 4th

defendants who constitute the majority in the Board of Directors

and have been and are in control of the 2nd defendant company

will not make any claim on behalf of the 2nd defendant company

1 During the investigation period of this customs inquiry, Mr. D.S. Wijesinghe, P.C. (vide page 443 of the brief), and during the customs inquiry, Mr. Prasanna Jayawardena, (I assume, presently, a Judge of the apex Court) (vide page 496 of the brief) have appeared. It has also been suggested to the 1st plaintiff that Mr. Ameen, P.C. also appeared for them, which has not been denied by the 1st plaintiff (vide page 361 of the brief). 2 Paragraph 5 of the plaint at page 47 of the brief.

in respect of the subject matter of this action.3 But this alleged

apprehension, in the facts of this case, is a pretence.

At the trial, the 2nd plaintiff who paid the penalty did not give

evidence, but the 1st plaintiff did give evidence. But, the 3rd

defendant, the alleged wrongdoer, who caused wrongful loss to

the company, gave evidence for the plaintiffs.

After trial, the District Judge has granted all the reliefs to the

plaintiffs. They are basically that the forfeiture and penalty

imposed are illegal, the textile material and the penalty paid

shall be returned to the company.

Being dissatisfied with this Judgment, the 1st defendant has

filed this appeal.

The pivotal argument of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General for the 1st defendant is that the plaintiffs have no locus

standi to file this action. This matter had inter alia been raised

in the District Court by way of issues, but the learned District

Judge has answered it against the 1st defendant. In my view,

the learned District Judge has erred on that threshold issue. If

the plaintiffs do not pass that test, consideration of merits of the

case does not arise.

Although the plaintiffs have not highlighted in the plaint, as the

1st plaintiff who gave evidence at the trial admitted, at all times

material to this action, the 2nd plaintiff was not only a director of

the 2nd defendant company, but also the majority shareholder

3 Paragraph 6 of the plaint at page 47 of the brief.

holding nearly 60% of the shares of the company.4 The 1st

plaintiff, who is also a shareholder of the company holds 100

shares, and also a director of the company from 05.01.1994.5

The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are very close relations6, and are living

in the same address/place.7 The 1st plaintiff is the Power of

Attorney holder of the 2nd plaintiff.8

At one time, in evidence, the 1st plaintiff has admitted that,

being the majority shareholder, the 2nd plaintiff controlled the

affairs of the company, but thereafter, changed it and stated

that the 3rd and 4th minority shareholders controlled the

company.9

Although the plaintiffs in the plaint state that the 3rd and 4th

respondents caused wrongful loss to the company, no action has

been taken against them by the 1st and/or the 2nd plaintiffs as

majority shareholders/directors of the company. No meeting has

been called in order to pass a resolution against alleged wrongful

acts of the 3rd and 4th defendants.10 No attempt has been made

by the plaintiffs who have the majority shareholding to remove

the errant 3rd and 4th directors by an ordinary resolution at a

General Meeting of the company and to appoint new directors.

They were admittedly serving as directors of the company even

at the time of the 1st plaintiff giving evidence without any

hindrance whatsoever.11

Notwithstanding the plaintiffs in the plaint state that the

forfeiture and penalty are illegal, the 1st plaintiff knows nothing

about the factual matters relating to the transaction in issue.12

All what the 1st plaintiff says is that the forfeiture of textile

material and imposing fines are illegal, and what the customs

could have done was to impose custom levies and not fines.

Had that been done, according to the 1st plaintiff, it was lawful.13

Ironically, the same position was taken by the 3rd defendant,

who is the alleged culprit, in his evidence given as the plaintiffs

witness.14 If the penalty was recovered as custom levies,

according to them, there is no wrongful loss to the company!

How can that happen, I am unable to comprehend!

If that contention is taken at its best, the wrongful act has been

done not by the 3rd and 4th defendants, but by the Sri Lanka

Customs. In that backdrop, I cannot understand why the

company cannot take action against the alleged wrongful acts

done by Sri Lanka Customs.

This position of the plaintiffs, and the 3rd and 4th defendants

(who are father and son respectively) cannot be believed in view

of the fact that they were fully represented by eminent lawyers at

the customs inquiry.

The Sri Lanka Customs has raided the bonded ware house of the

2nd defendant company on 20.07.1990 for alleged violation of

Customs Ordinance. The 1st plaintiff in his evidence stated that

the 2nd plaintiff knew about that incident in 1990.15 The 2nd

plaintiff did not contest the matter and after the customs inquiry

paid the penalty of Rs. 100,000 imposed on him as a director of

the company. It is not the position of the plaintiffs that the 3rd

and/or 4th defendants paid the penalty for the 2nd plaintiff

against the wishes of the 2nd plaintiff.

When the 1st plaintiff was asked why the plaintiffs and the 3rd

and 4th defendants did not contest the matter, his answer was

that it was due to fear.16 Same was stated by the 3rd defendant

who was called by the plaintiffs to give evidence on behalf of the

plaintiffs.17 The plaintiffs in their written submissions also state

that Evidence was also adduced with regard to the undue

pressure and/or harassment and/or duress brought upon the 4th

and 5th defendant-respondents (should be 3rd and 4th defendants)

by certain custom officers including Gamini Rajapakshe, who

gave evidence leading to the payment of the purported forfeitures

imposed through fear.

This purported fear/pressure/harassment/duress is

unbelievable, I repeat, as they were, at that time, represented by

eminent lawyers.

On the other hand, if the story of fear is correct, the 3rd and 4th

defendants have not acted fraudulently to the detriment of the

15 Page 348 of the brief. 16 320-322, 351-355, 402 of the brief. 17 Page 449 of the brief.

company. They could have got the company to file the action to

get the order made by the Customs quashed. If that argument of

the plaintiffs is correct, the foundation of the plaintiffs action is

wrong.

At this stage, it is interesting note that, the 3rd defendant, in his

evidence, in fact, admitted the violation of Customs Ordinance in

regard to this particular transaction. He admitted that the 2nd

defendant company was obliged to store the textile material,

imported under a special scheme without the payment of duty,

in the bonded warehouse, and send within the given time the

finished products made from the said textile material to the

foreign supplier, who is the owner of the said material, but it

was not done.18

It is trite law that a company is a legal person separate from its

shareholders who own it and directors who run it. Therefore, if a

wrong is committed against a company, only the company can

sue against the wrongdoers for redress. This fundamental

principle is known as proper plaintiff principle.19 However, one

cannot assume wrongdoing directors in control of the company

would bring an action in the name of the company alleging

wrongdoing against themselves. Hence proper plaintiff principle

cannot be an inflexible principle.20 The right to derivative

actions was developed as an exception to this proper plaintiff

principle. Derivative action allows a shareholder to sue on

behalf of the company if the company is unwilling to sue against

18 Pages 457-460 of the brief. Vide also pages 719-723 of the brief. 19Foss v. Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 46, Gray v. Lewis (1873) 8 Ch App 1035, Burland v. Earle [1902] AC 83 (PC) 20 In Foss v. Harbottle four exceptions were identified.

the wrongdoers because wrongdoers are in control of the

company.

Are the 3rd and 4th defendants wrongdoers? According to the 1st

plaintiff who gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs, and

according to the 3rd defendant who was called by the plaintiffs to

give evidence in support of the case for the plaintiffs, the 3rd and

4th defendants are not wrongdoers who acted to the detriment of

the company and its shareholders. The 3rd and 4th defendants

fought their case to the maximum retaining best lawyers at the

customs inquiry and paid the penalty. At best, the 3rd and 4th

defendants agreed to pay the penalty in fear of death threats.

That does not amount to committing a fraud or wrongdoing by

the 3rd and 4th defendants to the detriment of the company,

which entitles the plaintiffs to sue the 1st defendant on behalf of

the company.

On the other hand, if the 3rd and 4th defendants committed a

wrongdoing against the company, why no reliefs are sought

against them?

Are the 3rd and 4th defendants in control of the company? In the

facts and circumstances of this case, it is not possible. They are

in the minority. The majority shareholders are the plaintiffs.

The fact that the plaintiffs called the 3rd defendant to give

evidence for the plaintiffs present ample testimony that the

plaintiffs action is misconceived in law.

In view of that conclusion, consideration of merits of the case

does not arise.

For the aforesaid reasons, I answer issue No. 10 on locus standi

of the plaintiffs to file this action in favour of the 1st defendant-

appellant, and set aside the Judgment of the District Court, and

allow the appeal with costs.
