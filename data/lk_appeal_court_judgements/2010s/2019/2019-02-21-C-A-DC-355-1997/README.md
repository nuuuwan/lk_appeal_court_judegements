3 M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Walasmulla in respect of a partition action bearing Case Number 533/P.

The Plaintiffs-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs)

instituted this action seeking to partition the land called

Katuimbulahena in extent of 1 Acre 1 Rood and 26 Perches situated in

Hambantota.

The Defendants-Appellants stated that the original owner of the land

was one Senerath Pathiranage Don Davith Vas and he transferred to

Senerath pathiranage Etanahamy and she died leaving her widow

husband G. M. D. D. Hendric and son Peneris.

Hendrick sold his undivided half share to Andirishamy and Andirishamy

transferred his shares to the 1st Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the 1st Defendant). Also, Peneris transferred his

undivided half share to the 1st Defendant. Then the 1st Defendant

transferred the entire land to the 2nd Defendant-Appellant.

The Plaintiffs submitted that apart from Peneris, Ethanahamy who had

another child called Heenhamy alias Hamina and she had sold her

undivided shares to the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent by virtue of Deed No.

742 on 28.10.1970.

Upon conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge had delivered his

judgment on 29.05.1996 and allocated the shares as follows;

4

1st Plaintiff- undivided share 1st Defendant- undivided share and to enter a partition decree accordingly.

Defendants-Appellants being dissatisfied with the judgment of the

learned District Judge of Walasmulla have preferred this appeal and

prayed to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge on the

ground stating that the learned District Judge of Walasmulla has failed to

evaluate the evidence correctly and as a result he has misdirected

himself on the law and facts.

It is to be observed that the Plaintiffs submitted Heenhamy and Hamina

is the same person and she is one of the children of Ethanahamy. Her

birth certificate was produced and marked as P2.

Further, both Peneris and Heenhamy were called to give evidence and

established that their parents were Ethanahamy and Hendrick.

2nd Defendant-Appellant submitted that he is the owner of the entire

land in dispute according to Deed No. 6142 dated 30.05.1991 and also

upon the ground of prescription.

It is important to consider the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance 2 of 1889 the claimant must prove,

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession 2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant

plaintiff and 3. Ten years previous to the bringing of a such action

5 In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a change in

the nature of the possession and the party claiming prescriptive right

should show an ouster.

In Kanapathipillai Vs. Meerasaibo 58 NLR 41 Sansoni, J. with N. J.

Fernando, J. concurring has held as follows,

The rule is well settled that, when a co-owner conveys the

entire land held in common to a stranger, and the latter

enters into possession of the entire land under the

conveyance, he can, by possession adverse to all the co-

owners for ten years, acquire a prescriptive title. But where

such a stranger is aware, at the time he obtains the

conveyance, that his vendor was only a co-owner and was

not the sole owner of the land, ten years possession by him

will not give him a prescriptive title. Such a purchaser

cannot be said to have entered into possession as sole

owner, for he had knowledge that there were others who

owned shares in the land, and he will be presumed to have

possessed the land as a co-owner. The ordinary rule which

applied to possession by co-owners will then apply, viz., that

before one can prescribe against the others, there must be

an ouster or its equivalent, such as notice to those other co-

owners that he was setting up a title adverse to them.

I opinioned that the 2nd Defendant- had not fulfilled the requirements

set out to prove his prescriptive title in accordance with section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

6 Further, that Heenhamy alias Hamina is one of the children of

Ethanahamy has been suppressed and who also legal heir and entitled to

the specific land.

I am of the firm view that learned District Judge of Walasmulla had

carefully examined the title and the evidence placed before him and

correctly delivered his judgment.

For the foregoing reasons, I affirm the judgment delivered by the

learned District Judge of Walasmulla and dismiss the appeal with cost.

Appeal dismissed.
