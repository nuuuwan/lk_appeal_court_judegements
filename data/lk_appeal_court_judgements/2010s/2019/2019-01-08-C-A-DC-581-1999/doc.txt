M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J

This is a rei-vendicatio action filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as Plaintiff-Respondent) in the District Court of Kandy against the

1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Appellants seeking for following reliefs inter alia;

I. A declaration that the Plaintiff-Respondent is the owner of the

premises which was described in the schedule to the Plaint.

II. For ejectment of the 3rd Defendant-Appellant.

In this matter, Plaintiff-Respondent stated in her Plaint inter alia that the land

and premises described in the Plaint was belonged to W. N. Henricus Fernando

(3rd Defendant). The said W. N. Henricus Fernando executed the Deed of

Conditional Transfer bearing No. 2327 dated 15.10.1959 marked as P1 attested

by C. M. L. De Silva, Notary Public to one M. M. Punchi Banda upon the

condition that a sum of Rs.5000/- to be paid within four years from the date of

the said deed. And also, there is no interest mention in the said deed on the

repayment of Rs.5000/-. However the said 3rd Defendant-Appellant failed to

pay the sum of Rs.5000/- before the lapse of the said four years period, hence

the said M. M. Punchi Banda became the lawful owner of the said property.

Thereafter, the said M. M. Punchi Banda gifted the said property to his wife

Biso Menike, the Plaintiff-Respondent by Deed No. 2826 dated 17.05.1978

marked as P4 attested by T. A. Shahabdeen, Notary Public of Kandy.

Thereafter, on an application made by the 3rd Defendant-Appellant to the 1st

Defendant-Appellant bank requesting to acquire the said land under Finance

Act No. 11 of 1963. After finishing an inquiry, 1st Defendant-Appellant bank,

published in Gazette bearing No. 1481/1 dated 01.02.1969 and had acquired the

said property under Section 72 of the Finance Act No.11 of 1963. Thereafter

the appellant bank had made an attempt to take over possession of the said

property from the said M. M. Punchi Banda and it was prevented by him.

Thereafter the appellant bank filed an action in the Magistrate Court against the

4

Plaintiff-Respondents predecessor the said Punchi Banda to eject from the said

land under Section 72(5) of the Finance Act No.11 of 1963. However the

learned Magistrate of Kandy by the order dated 02.02.1976 rejected the

application of the appellant bank and discharged the said Punchi Banda.

Thereafter the appellant bank on or about 09.06.1983 filed an action against

Plaintiff-Respondent in this matter by case bearing No. 13839/L and had

obtained an ex-parte order to eject from the said property after the Plaintiff-

Respondent made an application to vacate the ex parte order, parties entered

into a settlement on 08.06.1984. The said case was laid by subject to the

Plaintiff-Respondent filing action against the appellant bank before 1st of

December 1984 and accordingly, the Plaintiff-Respondent filed this action

within the said period on the 27th of November 1984. In the interim period, the

appellant bank contrary to the undertaking executed the ex parte decree in the

said Case bearing No. 13839/L and ejected the Plaintiff-Respondent from the

property and took over the possession.

Therefore, the Plaintiff-Respondent filed this action for a declaration of title

and to restore the Plaintiff-Respondent in possession and to eject 3rd

Defendant-Appellant from the said property. The learned District Judge gave

judgment dated 12.03.1999 in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Thereafter

being aggrieved by the said judgments the appellants have appealed against the

same to this Court.

In an action for rei vendicatio, the plaintiff must prove and establish his title.

And the plaintiff action is for a declaration of title alleging that the defendant

was disputing his rights as the owner. In such case when the title is admitted

the burden is on the defendant to establish the legality of his possession.

5

In Abeykoon Hamine vs. Appuhamy [(1950) 52 NLR 41], Dias, SPJ. quoted

with approval, the decision of a Bench of four judges in De Silva v.

Goonetilleke [(1931) 32 NLR 27] where Macdonell, C.J., had occasion to

observe that-

There is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration

of title must have title himself. -To bring the action rei

vindication plaintiff must have ownership actually vested in

him- 1 Nathan p.362, s.593..This action arises from the

right of dominiumThe authorities unite in holding that

plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute, and that if he

cannot, the action will not lie.

In this matter, it was an admitted fact that the Plaintiff-Respondent proved her

title. In the case of Gunasekara & another vs. Latiff [(1999) 1 SLR 365], it

was held that ordinarily the plaintiff has the right to begin, but where the

defendant admits plaintiffs story and contends on some point of law or

additional facts to be alleged by him that the plaintiff is not entitled to any part

of the relief he claims, the defendant has the right to begin. (Also see:

Kathiramathamby vs. Arumugam [38 C.L.W. 27])

However, the Defendant-Appellants in this matter have taken up the position

that the 1st and 2nd Appellants were acted upon the statutory power vested on

them under Section 71 of the Finance Act.

Section 71 of the Finance Act No. 11 of 1963 states as follows,

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2),the Bank is hereby

authorized to acquire the whole or any part of any agricultural,

residential or business premises, if the Bank is satisfied that those

premises were, at any time before or after the appointed date but

not earlier than the first day of January, 1956,-

6

(a) sold in execution of a mortgage decree entered by a court

against the owner of such premises (hereafter in this Part of this

Act referred to as the " original owner"); or

(b) transferred by the owner of those premises (hereafter in this

Part of this Act referred to as the " original owner ") or his heirs,

executors or administrators to any other person or the heirs,

executors or administrators of any other person in satisfaction of

a debt which was due from the original owner or his predecessor

in title to that other person and which was secured by a mortgage

of those premises subsisting immediately prior to the transfer; or

(c) transferred by the owner of those premises (hereafter in this

Part of this Act referred to as the " original owner") or his heirs,

executors or administrators to any other person, at the request of

a mortgagee of those premises, in satisfaction or part satisfaction

of a debt which was due from the original owner or his

predecessor in title to that mortgagee and which was secured by

a mortgage of those premises subsisting immediately prior to the

transfer; or

(d) transferred by the owner of such premises to any other person

after receiving from such other person a sum of money as

consideration for such transfer and upon the condition that, on

the repayment by the transferor, (hereafter in this Part of this Act

referred to as the " original owner ") of that sum together with

interest thereon within a specified period such other person will

re-transfer those premises to the original owner.

(2) No premises shall be acquired under subsection (1) -

(a) unless an application in that behalf has been made to the

Bank by the original owner of such premises or, where such

7

original owner is dead or is of unsound mind or otherwise

incapable of acting, by the spouse or any descendant of such

person; or

(b) unless the Bank is satisfied that the average statutory income

of the person making the application and of the other members of

the family of which he is the head, computed under the provisions

of the written law relating to the imposition of income tax, for the

three years of assessment immediately preceding the date on

which such application was made by him, does not exceed a sum

of ten thousand rupees; or

(c) if the Bank is satisfied-

(i) that the premises to which the application relates are

reasonably required for occupation as a residence for the owner

of those premises or any member of the family of such owner or

for the purposes of any trade, business, profession, vocation or

employment of such owner or any member of his family and that

such owner or member of his family has no other premises which

could be used for the purpose for which the premises to which the

application relates are being used, or

(ii) that the premises to which the application relates were, prior

to the date of registration of the notice referred to in paragraph

(b) of subsection (4), purchased bona fide for valuable

consideration by the owner of such premises from the person to

whom such premises were sold or transferred in any of the

circumstances specified in subsection (1) or from any other

person to whom such premises were subsequently transferred by

such person; or

8

(d) unless, in the case of an application relating to any

agricultural premises, the Bank is satisfied that the applicant is

not the owner of any other agricultural premises exceeding ten

acres in extent.

(3) The question whether any premises which the Bank is

authorized to acquire under this Part of this Act should or should

not be acquired shall be determined by the Bank and every such

determination of the Bank shall be final and conclusive and shall

not be called in question in any court.

(4) Where the Bank has determined that any premises shall be

acquired for the purposes of this Part of this Act, the Bank shall-

Every notice under paragraph (b) shall be registered by the

Registrar of Lands in the manner provided in the Registration of

Documents Ordinance for the registration of an instrument

affecting or relating to land and shall be deemed for such

purposes to be an instrument affecting or relating to the premises

the prescribed particulars of which are set out in such notice.

(a) notify such determination to the owner of such premises; and

(b) cause a notice to be delivered or transmitted to the proper

Registrar of Lands for registration, setting out the prescribed

particulars relating to those premises and stating that those

premises are to be acquired under this Part of this Act.

According to this section, it is clear that the appellant bank has the right to

acquire a property which belongs to Section 71(1) of the said Act. However,

the said Subsection 1(d) clearly claims that the bank has right to acquire a

property in the event of conditional transfer on the repayment by the transferor,

of that sum together with interest thereon within a specified period such other

person will re-transfer those premises to the original owner.

9

However, this section was amended by No. 16 of 1973 Finance and Ceylon

State Mortgage Bank (Amendment Act (No. 16 of 1973) would not apply for

the same property since the acquisition taken place in 1969 under Finance Act

No. 11 of 1963.

Therefore, it is clear that there is no interest mentioned in the conditional

transfer to acquire by the appellant bank under Section 71(d) of the Finance

Act No. 11 of 1963. Therefore it is clear no right exists to acquire the said

property by the appellant bank under this Act.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the learned District Judge has

very carefully and correctly analyzed all the evidence placed before him for his

conclusion.

In this appeal, Plaintiff-Respondent raised Preliminary objection and submitted

that the Section 72(7) of the Finance Act No.11 of 1963 is a speedy Jurisdiction

and therefore it has not created or granted a right of appeal against an order

made in the exercise of such special jurisdiction.

In Bakmeewewa Authorised Officer of the Peoples Bank vs. Konara Raja

[(1989) 1 SLR 231], it was held by Justice G. P. S. De Siva that,

The jurisdiction exercised by the District Court under Section

72(7) and (8) of the Finance Act as amended is a special

jurisdiction and there is no right of appeal from an order in the

exercise of such jurisdiction, unless a right of appeal is expressly

provided for in the Act. No right of appeal is provided in the Act.

Hence the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an

application for stay of execution pending appeal under Sec.

763(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

10

This was further discussed by Justice S. Eva Wanasundera PC J. in the recent

case of Hetti Kankanamlage Gunasingha vs. Peoples Bank & Don

Wimalasiri Dissanayake, [bearing No. S. C. Appeal No. 77/15, which was

decided on 13.07.2017].

Therefore, in the above-stated reasons, I dismiss this appeal with cost fixed as

Rs. 15,000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
