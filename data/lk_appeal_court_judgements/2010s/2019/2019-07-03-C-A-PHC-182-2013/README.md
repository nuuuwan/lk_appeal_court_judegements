A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner-Appellants (Appellants), are seeking to set aside the

judgment dated 18112/2013, delivered by the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Gampaha and inter alia,

has sought a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the approval of

the building plan marked P 17 and P 18, approved by the 1 st and 2nd Respondent-

Respondents (Respondents), permitting to construct an 8 storey apartment building

by the 3rd and 4th Respondents.

When this case was taken up for inquiry, the Appellants alleged that the 3rd

and 4th Respondents together with the 1st and 2nd Respondents, maliciously and

unlawfully acted in order to construct a building without an approved building

plan which the Appellants submit is illegal. The learned High Court Judge

dismissed the said application on the basis that the Appellants were guilty of

laches and the availability of alternate relief.

The Respondents have raised several preliminary objections. The most

salient objection been that the Appellants are guilty of laches and has failed to

adduce any acceptable reason to excuse the delay in coming before Court.

The Appellants are lawful owners of the land adjoining premises bearing

No. 110 Sri Bodhi Road, Gampaha, where the disputed building is constructed.

The Appellants allege that since the said building consists of more than 4 floors, in

terms of Gazette Notification No. 1585/27, dated 23/0112009, and the relevant

planning and construction regulations applicable to the Gampaha development

area valid for 2006-2026, marked P8 and P6, respectively, the maximum floors

allowed to construct against a blind wall is 4 floors and for buildings over 4 floors,

1 meter space from either side to separate the building for access, construction and

maintenance. Therefore, it is submitted that the non-fulfillment of the required

criteria amounts to gross violation of the said regulations and the building

5

presently constructed is in violation of the said Regulations and therefore, contrary

to law.

The Appellants invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court by

Petition dated 12th October 2012, and thereafter, has filed an amended Petition

dated 1411112012. At the time of submitting the amended Petition, the building

had been constructed up to the 3rd floor. The Appellants submit that they raised

their grievance at the first available opportunity with the Respondents by their

letters of demand marked P20-P22. However, it is observed that Letters of

Demand marked P20 and P21 are not supported with proof of registered postal

article receipts. It is also observed that the letter seeking instructions from the 6th

Respondent marked P 16a, is an undated document.

The Appellant on 04/08/2011, by the information book extract marked

P19a, complained to the police of an illegal intrusion to the land by certain

unknown persons. A further statement to the police by the Appellant on

02/1112011, marked 19b, makes it clear that the Appellant was aware that the 3rd

Respondent was using heavy equipment in preparation of a construction in the

land. By letters dated 15/09/2011, 1311012011 and 0311112011, marked P13a, P13b

and P13c, the Appellant has drawn the attention of the Urban Development

Authority (5th Respondent), regarding the damage and the hardship caused to the

Appellant, as a result of the said construction by the 3rd and 4th Respondents.

6

Letter dated 15/09/2011, addressed to the 5th Respondent marked P13a,

clearly indicates that the Appellant was aware that the 3rd and 4th Respondents

were preparing the site to construct a building consisting of 8 floors, however, the

Appellant has not taken any objection to the said construction. The Appellants

concern was to protect the boundary wall of the land and also to protect the earth

been washed away, causing damage to the land due to the said construction. It is

noted that by letter dated 14/12/2011, the Appellants have been summoned for an

inquiry regarding this matter by letter dated 3111012011, marked P15, and

accordingly, the 5th Respondent has advised the respective parties to prevent any

harm that could cause damage to the Appellants land.

In the above context, notably, when the Appellant addressed letter dated

15/0912011, to the 6th Respondent, the Appellant was aware that the building to be

constructed in the adjoining land consisted of 8 floors. However, it is admitted that

by the time the Appellant supported the case in the High Court, the construction

consisted of 3 floors. The Appellants delay in filing Petition is attributed to the

Respondents failure to provide the necessary information and acting mala fide.

The Appellants also contend that the delay in filling the objections by the

Respondents in the High Court, has resulted in the construction reaching 8 floors.

As observed earlier, even though the Appellant, was aware in September

2011, (P13a) that a building consisting of 8 floors is to be constructed, the

7

Appellant came before the High Court when the building construction had reached

3 floors. By amended Petition dated 14/11/2012, the Respondents appeared before

the High Court on notice, on 01/03/2017.

"the claimant must apply for permission promptly, and in any event,

within three months of the date on which grounds for the claim first

arose. When the claim is made outside these limits, the claimant must

apply for an extension of time and provide adequate reasons for the

delay. " (Judicial remedies in Public Law 5th Ed. Lewis at page 336.)

The Appellants attribute the delay on the Respondents for not filling

objections on time in the High Court, however, has failed to explain the delay on

the part of the Appellant coming before the High Court without undue delay. It is

the duty of the Appellants to diligently prosecute an application filed before Court

and if not should necessarily bare consequences of default. "The court would also

take into consideration the consequences which the issue of the writ will entail".

(Pradeshiya Sabawa, Hingurakgoda, and others v. Karunaratne and others

(2006) 2SLR 410)

Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services (1996) 2 SLR

70, the Court held that,

"A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a

I

matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief,

still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to his

conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief"

In Bisomenika vs. C.R. de Alwis, 19821 SLR 368, the Court held that;

"A writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the court. It cannot be

held to be a writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The

exercise of this discretion by court is governed by certain well accepted

principles. The court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party

aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he

has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own

conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver ... The

proposition that the application for writ must be sought as soon as

injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine that

delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his

rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in writ

application dwindles and the court may reject a writ application on the

ground of unexplained delay ... An application for a writ of certiorari

should be filed within a reasonable time. "

Therefore, taking into consideration the delay on the part of the Appellants

In filling this application and the prejudice that could be caused to the

Respondents in granting the relief prayed for at this stage, the application for a

writ of Certiorari should be refused.

Accordingly, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
