This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Western Province

holden in Panadura dated 20.04.2005.

The Wadduwa Police instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Panadura in the above

styled application in terms of section 66{l)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act). The

report stated that there was a dispute affecting a right of way between the 1st Party Respondents-

Appellants (Appellants) and the 2nd Party Petitioners-Respondents (Respondents).

Page 3 of 6

After due inquiry the learned Magistrate held that the Appellants were entitled to the right of

way and made order accordingly. Aggrieved by the said order the Respondents moved in revision

to the High Court of the Western Province holden in Panadura where it was set aside and order

was made in favour of the Respondents. Hence this appeal.

When this matter was taken up for argument parties agreed to dispose it by way of written

submissions.

The Respondents brought to the notice of Court that the Respondents had filed an action in the

District Court of Panadura bearing no. 1672/L where a declaration of title to the land in dispute

was sought in addition to orders preventing the Appellants from entering into the said land. The

Appellants made across-claim for a right of way which is the same issue that was before both the

Magistrate Court and High Court. The learned Additional District Judge dismissed both the action

of the Respondents and the cross-claim of the Appellants.

On this basis the Respondents now submit that the Appellants cannot maintain the present

appeal.

Section 69(2) of the Act enables the Primary Court Judge to make order declaring that any person

specified therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any part of the

land as may be specified in the order until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of an

order or decree of a competent court and prohibit all disturbance or interference with the

exercise of such right by such party other than under the authority of an order or decree as

aforesaid. In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [(1982) 2 SrLL.R. 693 at 699] Sharvananda J. (as he was

then) stated as follows:

"On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than right

of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to section 69(1), is who

is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle" here connotes the

ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the parties has acquired

that right or is entitled for the time being to exercise that right. In contradistinction to

section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine the question which party is entitled

to the disputed right preliminary to making an order under section 69(2)." (emphasis

added)

In Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam (78 N.L.R. 280J Sharvananda J. (as he was then) held that the

pendency of a civil suit in respect of the right in question is no bar to action being taken under

section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law (analogous to section 66 of the Act). However, he

also held (at page 283):

"Section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law confers special jurisdiction on a

Magistrate to make orders to prevent a dispute affecting land escalating and causing a

breach of the peace. The jurisdiction so conferred is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The

primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred on the Magistrate is the prevention of a

breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The section enables the

Magistrate temporarily to settle the dispute between the parties before the Court and

maintain the status guo until the rights of the parties are decided by a competent civil

Court." (emphasis added)

Section 74(1) of the Act clarifies this position in stating:

"An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in any land or

part of a land which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit; and it shall be the

duty of a Judge of a Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry under this Part to

explain the effect of these sections to the persons concerned in the dispute."

The Act was intended to prevent any breach of peace arising as a result of any dispute affecting

land. It does not in any way seek to preserve final orders made by both the Primary Court and a

civil court on the rights of parties on the same issue.

The dispute as to the right of way claimed by the Appellants was put in issue in the civil action,

District Court of Panadura case no. 1672/L, by way of cross-claim which was dismissed. The

Appellants have not preferred any appeal against the said judgment. In any event, moment the

cross-claim was dismissed by the District Court the alleged right of way claimed by the Appellants

stands rejected by a competent civil court.

The Appellants are now seeking to resurrect the order made in their favour by the learned

Magistrate on the right of way in order to overcome its rejection by a civil court. That is not

permitted by law.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Western Province holden in Panadura dated 20.04.2005 which is now in any event

overshadowed by the judgment in District Court of Panadura in case no. 1672/L. That judgment

was delivered on 01.09.2014 but yet the Appellants chose to maintain this appeal which is a

matter to be taken into consideration with regard to costs.

I hold that the Appellants cannot maintain this appeal and dismiss it with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000/=.
