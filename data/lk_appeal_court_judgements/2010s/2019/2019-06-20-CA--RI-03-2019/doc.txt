Order

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

Heard Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this application.

The Petitioner states that the central issue of this case is to determine

whether the Rent Act applies to the premises in suit, and if so was the Petitioner

entitled to the protection of the Rent Act.

By Judgment dated 19/02/2010, the learned District Judge held that the

premises in suit were not exempted premises in terms of the provisions of the Rent

Act and therefore the Respondent becomes a tenant under the Petitioner after the

expiration of the Lease Agreement marked Pl.

Against the said Order, the Petitioner filed an appeal in the Civil Appellate

High Court of the Western Province holden at Gmnpaha, the said appeal was

dislnissed. Thereafter the Petitioner filed a Leave to Appeal Application, where

the Supreme Court refused to grant leave.

The Petitioner heavily relies on the document marked P5, in order to decide

the annual value of the premises, which was a matter put in issue at the trial stage.

However, the Petitioner admits that the said document which the Petitioner claims

to be a deciding factor for the Court to have concluded that the premises in suit

was exempted premises, was not submitted to the trial court or even at the appeal

stage to the Civil Appeal High Court.

4

The Petitioner having exhausted the appeal process now cannot be

permitted to reagitate a Inatter already put in issue by an application in the nature

of Restitutio-In-Integrum. We are mindful that if such an application is permitted

at this stage there would be endless litigation with no finality. Therefore, we refuse

notice on the Respondent.

Petition is dismissed without costs.
