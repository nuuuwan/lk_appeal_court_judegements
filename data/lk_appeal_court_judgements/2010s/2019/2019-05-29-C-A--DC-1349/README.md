Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs-respondents filed this action in the District

Court of Ambilipitiya seeking declaration of title to the land

described in the schedule to plaint in favour of the 2nd plaintiff,

ejectment of the defendant-appellant therefrom, and damages.

The defendant whilst seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action

sought declaration of title to the land in her favour by way of a

claim in reconvention. After trial, the learned District Judge

entered Judgment for the plaintiffs except for damages. Hence

this appeal by the defendant.

A Permit under section 19(2) of the Land Development

Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935, as amended, has been issued to

Podimanike, who was the mother of the 1st plaintiff and the

defendant, and the grandmother of the 2nd plaintiff. This Permit

has been marked subject to proof by the 1st plaintiff in his

evidence as P1. According to P1, Permit has been issued in the

name of Podimanike on 06.07.1990 and Permit-holder

Podimanike has, on 17.07.1990, nominated her grandson, the

2nd plaintiff, as her successor. As this was marked subject to

proof, a Land Officer of the Mahawali Authority has been called

to give evidence and that officer who had brought the relevant

file regarding issuance of this Permit has in his evidence clearly

confirmed the aforesaid nomination. He has further stated in

evidence that upon the claim made by the defendant regarding

this land, an inquiry was held at the Mahaweli Authority, but

they could not grant any relief to the defendant, because

Podimanike had nominated the 2nd plaintiff as her successor. It

appears that spouse of Podimanike has predeceased her.

Therefore, in terms of section 49 of the Land Development

3

Ordinance, the 2nd plaintiff, as the nominated successor is

entitled to succeed to the land.

The pivotal argument of the learned counsel for the defendant-

appellant before this Court is that there is no proper nomination

in terms of section 56 of the Land Development Ordinance and

therefore the said nomination is invalid. According to section

56, the nomination of a successor shall be in the prescribed

form executed in triplicate before a Government Agent or a

Registrar of Lands or a Divisional Assistant Government Agent

or a Notary or a Justice of Peace. Page 4 of P1, of which the

Land Officer gave evidence, clearly shows that the nomination

has been made by the Permit-holder Podimanike by placing her

thumb impression before the same officer (the Divisional

Manager of the Mahaweli Authority, Ambilipitiya) by whom the

Permit P1 was issued and the said officer has also countersigned

the nomination. No question has been put to the Land Officer in

cross examination about the requirements of section 56

aforementioned for the said officer to satisfy the Court of

compliance with that section with the documents should have

been available with him in his file. Without putting that matter

in issue in the trial Court, in my view, it is too late in the day to

raise that matter for the first time in appeal.

In any event, at the closure of the case for the plaintiffs, reading

in evidence the documents marked P1-P3, which includes the

Permit P1, no objection has been raised stating that P1 has not

been duly proved. Then it is settled law that P1 becomes

evidence for all intents and purposes without qualificationVide

Judgments of Chief Justice Samarakoon in Sri Lanka Ports

Authority v. Jugolinija Boat East [1981] 1 Sri LR 18 and Chief

4

Justice G.P.S. de Silva in Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v. Talalle

Methananda Thero [1997] 2 Sri LR 101. If P1 is to be accepted

without qualification, the nomination stated in P1 has to be

admitted without any further proof. Accordingly, main

submission of the defendant-appellant fails.

The next submission of the learned counsel for the defendant-

appellant is that the 2nd plaintiff does not become entitled to

succession in terms of rule 1 of the third schedule read with

section 72 of the Ordinance. Succession under the third

schedule becomes relevant if no successor has been nominated

or if the nominated successor fails to succeed. Here the

consideration of the third schedule does not arise as successor

has been nominated from the group of relatives enumerated in

the third schedule as stated in section 51 of the Ordinance.

Connected to this argument, the learned counsel also takes up

the position that the 2nd plaintiff as the nominated successor

failed to succeed. This argument in my view can be advanced

provided the defendant-appellant accepts the 2nd plaintiff was

the nominated successor. She cannot approbate and reprobate.

But the defendant-appellant did not accept it and did not allow

the two plaintiffs, father and son respectively, to continue with

possession or take possession of the land. In the said

circumstances, it does not lie in the mouth of the defendant-

appellant now to say that the 2nd defendant-appellant failed to

succeed. I reject the second argument.

The third argument of the learned counsel is that the main relief

prayed for in the prayer to the plaint, which is paragraph (a) of

the prayer to the plaint, whereby the 2nd plaintiff seeks a

(title declaration) to the land in suit is misconceived in

5

law. It is not the submission of the learned counsel that the

plaintiffs cannot seek a declaration of title on the Permit. The

learned counsel admits that Palisena v. Perera (1954) 56 NLR

407 allows the plaintiffs to maintain a vindicatory action on a

Permit. His argument is regarding the phraseology used seeking

that relief. Title declaration, to my mind, means, declaration of

title. It is clear from paragraph 3(a) of the Petition of Appeal

that, that is how even the defendant-appellant has understood

that relief. I am not impressed by that argument.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
