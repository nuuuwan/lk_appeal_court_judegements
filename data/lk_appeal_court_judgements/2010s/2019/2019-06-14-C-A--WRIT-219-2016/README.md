Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner, a Viharadhipathi of a temple, filed this

application seeking to quash the order dated 04.05.2016 made

by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development under

section 90(1) of the Agrarian Development Act, No.46 of 2000, as

amended, whereby the petitioner was directed to reopen the

agricultural road used by the farmers to have access to their

paddy fieldsHirikumbura Kidali Yaya. After the case was filed,

with the consent of the learned counsel for the petitioner, a fresh

inquiry was held by the Commissioner General and made a

detailed fresh order dated 15.05.2017. However no application

has been made on behalf of the petitioner amending the original

relief.

The position taken up by the petitioner before this Court is that

such an agricultural road was non-existent across the temple

land and the neighbourhood famers gained access to their

respective paddy fields along the ridge (niyara).

When I read the evidence of the petitioner priest (88 years of age

at that time) given at the inquiry before the Commissioner

General, it appears to me that the position of the petitioner at

that time was that there was no motorable road across the

temple through which land master tractors were taken by the

farmers to gain access to their paddy fields.

This assertion has been proved untrue at the inquiry where

several farmers have given convincing evidence to say the said

road which had been using by them for long time for agricultural

purposes was obstructed by the petitioner priest since lately.

The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is

that there is no cogent evidence to establish a servitude and also

there is an alternative road (as stated by farmer Damayanthi at

the inquiry) to go to the paddy fields.

When I read the evidence of the said farmer Damayanthi, it is

seen that she has not clearly admitted that there is an

alternative road. Instead, in the order of the Commissioner

dated 15.05.2017, it has been stated that the petitioner priest

never showed an alternative road, and the road which the priest

told was used by the farmers, i.e. through the ridge (niyara),

cannot be used to take land master tractors to the paddy fields

for their agricultural purposes.

In the backdrop of the aforementioned contention of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner, let me consider what is expected by

the legislature from the Commissioner General in making the

order.

The question in this case revolves around some complaints

made around 17 farmers to the Commissioner General about

obstructing an agricultural road. Their complaint seems to be

that because of the closure of the road they could not cultivate

the paddy fields for two seasons as they could not take land

master tractors to the paddy fields for agricultural purposes.

In section 101 of the Act, which is the interpretation section,

agricultural road has been given a broader interpretation. It

reads as follows:

agricultural road means a road used to transport

agricultural crops or to transport the harvest or to drive or

transport animals, or to transport agricultural equipment

4

and machinery or for the purposes of supplying agricultural

services or for any other agricultural activity and includes a

road used for the purpose of gaining access to agricultural

land and includes a road which prior to this date had been

used for any of the purposes stated above.

Section 90(1) of the Act under which the Commissioner General

made the order reads as follows:

Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner General by

any owner cultivator or occupier of agricultural land that

any person is interfering with or attempting to interfere with

the cultivation rights, threshing rights, rights of using a

threshing floor, the right of removing agricultural produce or

the right to the use of an agricultural road of such owner

cultivator or occupier, the Commissioner-General after

inquiry may if he is satisfied that such interference or

attempted interference will result in damage or loss of crop

or livestock, issue an order on such person, cultivator or

occupier requiring him to comply with such directions as

may be specified in such order necessary for the protection

of such rights:

Provided that an order under this section shall not be made

for the eviction of any person from such agricultural land:

Provided further that an order issued under subsection (1)

shall not prejudice the right, title or interest of such person,

cultivator or occupier to such land, crop or livestock in

respect of which such order is made.

Section 90(3) reads as follows:

5

An order under subsection (1) shall be binding on the

person in respect of whom it is made until set aside by a

court of competent jurisdiction.

Leaving alone the other sections of the Act, when the second

proviso to section 90(1) read with 90(3), it appears to me that,

the Commissioner General is expected to make a provisional

order which will not prejudice the substantive rights of the

person or persons concerned.

Further, according to section 90(1), the test is whether the

interference to the right will result in damage or loss of crop or

livestock.

Same section provides for an occupier to make such complaint

to the Commissioner General, and according to section 101,

occupier means the person for the lime being entitled to the use

and occupation of agricultural land.

That shows the provisional nature of the order expected to be

made by the Commissioner General.

Hence I am unable to accept the argument of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner that a servitude right of access over

temple land was not strictly proved by the farmers at the

inquiry.

When I read the inquiry notes, it is seen that such a high-

handed position was never taken up by the Attorney-at-Law who

appeared for the petitioner priest at the inquiry before the

Commissioner General.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
