Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking

declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the

plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom, and damages. The

defendant filed the answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs

case. After trial, the District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs

action with costs. This appeal by the plaintiff is against that

Judgment.

This is a rei vindicatio action and therefore the burden is entirely

on the plaintiff to prove his case.

The plaintiff relied on the Final Decree of Partition marked P2,

entered in District Court Colombo Case No. 7150/P, to claim

title to the land.

The plaintiff cannot claim prescriptive title to the land as the

plaintiff has filed this action on the basis that the defendant is

in forcible possession of the land at least from 1985.

The defendant produced the Deed No.3196 marked V1 to say

that, the plaintiff, who was the 1st defendant in the said partition

case, during the pendency of the partition case, sold his rights,

which he would get from the Final Partition Decree, to his father,

Jayasena, who was the 2nd defendant in the partition case, and

therefore the plaintiff has no title to the land.

Although the plaintiff in his plaint has not mentioned about this

deed, and in the replication boldly stated that it is a forged

document, he has admitted that deed in his evidence in chief

itself.

Thereafter the plaintiffs position was that it is an invalid deed,

in terms of section 66 of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977, as

amended, as it was executed during the pendency of the

partition case. This argument is unsustainable.

A party in a partition action can sell, pending partition, whatever

the interests he might ultimately be allotted in the final decree of

partition. Sale of contingent rights pending partition is

permitted and not obnoxious to the Partition Law. (Rajapakse v.

Dassanayake (1928) 29 NLR 509, Salee v. Natchia (1936) 39 NLR

259, Sirisoma v. Saranelis Appuhamy (1950) 51 NLR 337)

By this deed marked V1, what the plaintiff sold was, as seen

from the schedule thereof, The Lot or Lots that may be allotted to

me with the buildings thereon and the compensation under the

Final Decree for partition that may be entered in case No.7150/P

of the District Court of Colombo. That is not prohibited or in

contravention of section 66 of the Partition Law.

In Manchanayake v. Perera (1945) 46 NLR 457 it was held:

A conveyance executed after the institution of a partition

action, and before the entering of the final decree,

purporting to sell, assign, transfer, and set over to the

vendee the interest to which the said vendor may be

declared entitled to in the final decree to be entered into in

the said case from and out of all that land (i.e., the subject

of the partition suit) is valid and not obnoxious to section 17

of the Partition Ordinance. It passes an immediate interest

in the property and is not merely an agreement to convey in

the future.

In Wijesinghe v. Sonnadara (1951) 53 NLR 241 it was held:

The sale by a co-owner in land of whatever interests might

ultimately be allotted to him under the decree in a pending

partition action may be construed as a conventio rei

speratae. In such a case, if some benefit, even to a far

smaller extent than the parties had originally hoped for,

accrued to the seller under the partition decree, the

purchaser is not entitled to claim a cancellation of the sale

on the ground of failure of consideration.

In that eventuality, the transferee need not be added as a party

to the partition action (Abeyratne v. Rosalin [2001] 3 Sri LR 308),

although in the instant case, the transferee, Jayasena, was a

party to the partition action.

There is also no necessity to execute another deed after entering

the Final Decree as the Lot will automatically pass to the

transferee without any further conveyance. (Sillie Fernando v.

Silman Fernando (1962) 64 NLR 404, Karunaratne v. Perera

(1966) 67 NLR 529)

I dismiss the appeal with costs.
