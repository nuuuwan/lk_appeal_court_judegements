Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st plaintiff-petitioner filed this unique application for

revision in the nature of restitutio in integrum seeking to set

aside four specific orders dated 22.11.2007, 23.11.2007,

29.11.2007 and 11.01.2017 of the District Court of Kalutara

delivered in Partition Case No. 1701/P.

The case has been instituted in the District Court 30 years ago

in the year 1989. The Final Decree (P8) has been entered in

2003. According to the Final Decree, Lot 8 of the Final Plan

(P7A) has been left unallotted. This has been done pursuant to

the order dated 18.11.1993 (P3), which has been affirmed by

this Court in appeal. In that order P3, it has inter alia been

stated that in case the 1st and 2nd defendants later prove their

entitlement to the said unallotted shares, Court can consider to

allot those shares to the said defendants.

In the meantime, the 1st defendant has died and, according to

the JE No.100 (of the District Court case record) dated

22.11.2007, his two children, namely, Rohana Bandula

Keerthisinghe Perera and Chandra Jayantha Perera have been

added as 10th and 11th defendants. This is the first order the 1st

plaintiff seeks to set aside. It is significant to note that this

addition has been made, as seen from the journal entry, without

any objection from the plaintiff. It says: No objections from the

plaintiff. Appointment made. Hence the plaintiff cannot, 12

years thereafter, challenge that order by an application for

revision in the nature of restitutio in integrum. In any event, that

order, whether set aside or not, has no significance whatsoever

either to the plaintiffs case or to the 1st defendants case as no

steps thereafter have been taken on that basis.

3

The second order which the 1st plaintiff seeks to set aside is the

order made on the following day, i.e. 23.11.2007 reflected in JE

No.101 whereby upon petition and affidavit being filed, the

aforesaid Rohana Bandula Keerthisinghe Perera was appointed

as the 1A defendant (instead of the 10th defendant). There was

no reason for the plaintiff to object to it as only the defendants

number has been changed from 10 to 1A. The 1st plaintiff

cannot now challenge that order after 12 years.

The third order which the 1st plaintiff challenges is the order

dated 29.11.2007 (P12). According to the proceedings, that was

the date of inquiry into the application in respect of the claim for

unallotted shares. It is noteworthy that, according to the

proceedings, the plaintiff has been fully represented by his

Attorney-at-Law on that day. At the inquiry, the 1A defendant,

namely, Rohana Bandula Keerthisinghe Perera has given

evidence and he has not been cross examined by the Attorney-

at-Law of the plaintiff. Having satisfied with that uncontroverted

and unchallenged evidence, the Court has made order allotting

Lot 8 of the Final Plan to the 1st and 2nd defendants in common,

2/3 and 1/3 share respectively, and further ordered to amend

the Final Decree accordingly. The 1st plaintiff has no right

whatsoever to challenge that order after 12 years.

The 2nd defendant has later died leaving behind his wife and two

children, and the 1A defendant has purchased their rights on

Lot 8 by way of a Deed, and made an application to appoint him

as the legal representative of the deceased 2nd defendant1 and

deliver possession of the entire Lot 8 to him. This application

has been allowed by the District Judge by order dated

1 Vide pages 134-144 of the DC Brief.

4

11.01.2017. This is the last order which is being canvassed in

this application.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the 1st plaintiff

that under section 52 of the Partition Law, the 1A defendant is

only entitled to an order for delivery of possession for 2/3 share

of the 1st defendant, and he is not entitled to take possession of

the 1/3 share in Lot 8 allotted to the deceased 2nd defendant.

If the learned counsel accepts that the substituted 1A defendant

can take possession of the 2/3 share in Lot 8 allotted to the

deceased 1st defendant, the 1A defendant can be substituted in

place of the deceased 2nd defendant (on the application already

made before the District Judge with the consent of the heirs of

the deceased 2nd defendant) and take possession of the balance

1/3 share as well.

In any event, the 1st plaintiff does not explain why she waited

more than 1 year and 2 months to challenge this order. The

order is dated 11.01.2017 and she came before this Court on

20.03.2018.

Revision or restitutio in integrum is a discretionary relief. It is

granted not as a matter of right but as a matter of grace at the

discretion of Court.

A party seeking a discretionary relief must act with utmost

promptitude and come to Court without delay.

It appears from P13 that the 1st plaintiff has gone before the

High Court of Civil Appeal by way of revision just before her

coming to this Court and withdrawn that application for reasons

best known to her. As a copy of the said revision application

5

has not been tendered to this Court, it is not clear on what

grounds and challenging which orders, the 1st plaintiff went

before the High Court.

It is trite law that a party seeking a discretionary relief must also

act with uberrima fidesutmost good faith. If he is later found to

be in lacking in that respect, the Court will not hesitate to

dismiss the application in limine on that ground alone without

going into the merits of the matter.

By looking at the JE No.111 it appears that the Fiscal could not

hand over possession of Lot 8 to the 1A defendant as a part of a

building put up in the adjoining Lot has encroached on Lot 8. It

is this matter which has triggered the 1st plaintiff to file this

applicaton.

Then by JE No.112 dated 05.06.2017 and the petition and

affidavit relevant to that application2 it is clear that the 1st

plaintiff has sold her portion of land which she got from the

Final Decree as far back as in 2007 to a third party by way of a

Deed of Transfer and after several transactions, it has been

purchased by the petitioner in the application relevant to JE

No.112 (who has not been made a party to the present

application), and the said third party by that application sought

not to demolish the part of the building gone to Lot 8 until

common boundary between Lot 8 and adjoining Lot 6 is

demarcated with the assistance of a surveyor. The 1A defendant

has filed objections to this application3 with documents to prove

that, when the construction was about to be made by the said

third party encroaching on Lot 8, he made a complaint to the

2 Vide pages 145-191 of the DC Brief. 3 Vide pages 192-205 of the DC Brief.

6

police and despite objections, construction was carried out at

their own peril. It appears from JE No.113 and 115 that the

District Court has dismissed that application of the third party

on 25.09.2017 on a preliminary objection.

However the 1st plaintiff did not tender a copy of the said order,

nor did he highlight those events in the instant application, and

presented this case on a different complexion giving the

impression to this Court that still she is the owner of Lot 6. This

is a suppression or misrepresentation, if not deliberate

distortion, of the real facts.

The 1st plaintiff on that ground and also on merits is not entitled

to succeed this application.

I unhesitatingly dismiss the application with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000/= payable by the 1st plaintiff to the 1A defendant.
