The Accused-Petitioner - On 22.10.2018 The Respondents ~ On 04.09.2018

1(.1.01.2019

The Accused-Petitioner has filed this rJ d sion application seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge }fGampaha dated 26.10.2016 and seeking

to impose the default sentence in the j _ldgment dated 23.03.2016 under case No.

HC 74/2010.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioner') was indicted in

the High Court of Gampaha as follows; I

1) The accused committed Grave Sexual Abuse, by oral penetration, on a

boy who was under 16 years of age and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code (as amended)

Pagl 2 of 16

I .

, '

2) The accused committed Grave Sexual Abuse, by anal penetration, on a

boy who was under. 16 years of age and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code (as amended).

On 23.03.2016, the petitioner had plead~d guilty to the said charges and the

Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha had convicted the petitioner. Accordingly

the Learned High Court Judge had impos~ j following sentences for two charges;

Charge 01:

i) A tenn of 24 months rigorous imprisonment that was suspended for

10 years,

ii) A fine of Rs.5000/= and if default a tenn of 4 months simple

imprisonment,

iii) A compensation of Rs.30, 000/= to be paid to the victim and if <J.tfault

a tenn of 10 months rigorous imprisonment.

Charge 02:

.. ~ i) A tenn of 24 months rigoro~Js imprisonment that was suspendff for

10 years,

ii) A fine of Rs5000/= and if default a tenn of 4 months simple

imprisonment, i

I , ~'14" iii) A compensation of Rs.20, 000/= to be paid to the viCtim and if cltrault

a term of 10 months rigorous,:imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge had further directed that the imprisonment of

\ charge 01 and charge 02 to run concurrently. Thereafter the case was called on

17.05.2016 and 21.06.2016 for the purpose of paying the compensation to the

victim. The petitioner had moved further time to pay the compensation and

I'

'i, however was absent on the next date i.L. 26.09.2016. Therefore a warrant was

issued on the petitioner and he was arrested and produced before the succeeding

Learned High Court Judge of Gampal.aon 26.10.2016. The petitioner had

informed Court that he was unable to pa~( the compensation on that day as well.

Thereafter the Learned High Court Judgci had set aside and varied the judgment

.-dated 23.03.2016 by imposing the following sentences;

::i

i) A term of 07 years rigorous iplprisonment for the 1 st charge,

ii) A term of 07 years rigorous i)'J.prisonment for the 2nd charge,

iii) A compensation ofRs. 50,OJ")/= to be paid to the victim and if default

a term of 6 months simple imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge had furth;~r directed the terms of imprisonment to

run consecutively.

, -,-

j

Being aggrieved by the said order dateU 26.10.2016 the petitioner preferred a

revision application to this Court.

,I

" The Learned Counsel for the petitioner r.as submitted following two grounds of

revISIOn;

, I, 1) The judgment dated 23.03.2016 was not illegal,

I 2) Per incuriam rule was not applic~ble to the judgment dated 23.03.2016

'. and therefore the succeeding High Court Judge was not empowered to

vary the said judgment.

-, The Learned State Counsel for the complrl.inant-respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the 'respondent') contended that b; ~th judgments dated 23.03.2016 and

26.10.2016 are infact illegal. Accordingly the Learned State Counsel seeks to set

aside both sentences and to impose a legai'sentence on the petitioner.

f Page 4 Jf 16

, .

We observe that section 365B (2) (b) oT the Penal Code carnes a mInImUm

, mandatory sentence of a tenn of 07 years. IIowever the Supreme Court, in cases of

.' S.C reference No. 03/2008-H.C. Anut adhapura 334/2004 and Ambagala

Mudiyanselage Samantha Sampath VJ1Attorney General [S.C. Appeal No.

I .. 17/2013], was of the view that Court can impose a sentence below the minimum

!I '

\l mandatory sentence depending on the circumstances of each case.

'1 In the case of Ambagala Mudiyanselag~~ Samantha Sampath (supra), it was

. held that,

"In the present case, we must look at the big picture with the victim of rape

the Appellant, the father of the child born, and the 10 year- old girl child

who was born into this world as a vesult of the victim having been raped.

. ,~ The victim of rape never complaine~ to the Police until after a pregnancy of

5 months when Police on its own c~me to the victim in search of her when

an outsider informed the Police o/ .. her missing from home. There was no

chance for the victim to give eviden~e as the Appellant pleaded guilty to the

charge of statutory rape of the victil.'1. There is a bar for the victim and the

1 Appellant to enter into a marriag~ as the Appellant is already legally

1 married to the victim 's sister who is'!iving abroad. The child is being looked

after by the Appellant father in th~ eyes of the sOclety, and the child is

dependent on the income earned by (lie Appellant ...

I agree with the decision of the Suj,"reme Court in S. C. Reference 0312008

and uphold the conclusion of thqt case that the minimum mandatory

sentence in Section 364(2) (e) is in ;. ~onflict with Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12(1)

i of the Constitution and that the Hig~i Court is not inhibited from imposing a

sentence that it deems appropriate {n the exercise of its judicial discretion

notwithstanding the minimum mand~itory sentence ... "

In the case of Hirimuthugoda Sanjeewa, Shantha alias Ran Mama V. Attorney

~ f . " General (C.A. 150/2010), Justice A. GObneratne observed as follows;

"In S. C 03/2008 the Accused and] the complainant though under age had a

love affair. and both parties Md eloped and had sexual intercourse ..

\ . ':( Thereafter the respective parentsJntervened and brought the complainant

J back home. To arrive at a decisio~the Supreme Court considered numerous

'1 , authorities and decisions inclus~1'e of Article 4 (c), 11 & 12(1) of the,

\ Constitution. What is paramount /s the nature of the offence/age and the

judicial discretions that need to be exercised by a court of law, in the

circumstances and the context of the case before court and I think the

decision in S. C. 03/2008 cannot bind any other court where the offence is of

a very serious nature as in that judgment (s. C. 03/2008) court emphasis the

fact of the nature of the offence and judges' discretion. It could be used in an

appropriate case to impose a ~entence below the minimum mandatory

sentence, but not in each and ev~ry case of grave sexual offence. I would ,

I refer to the following excerpts frorrf the judgment in S. C. 03/2008 ...

(However there may well ~e exceptional cases in which an offence

may be so serious in natur:c that irrespective of the circumstances a

I Court may never exercis"e judicial discretion in favour of a

punishment that is less than an appropriate minimum mandatory

punishment. The reasoning fn Re: Prevention of Organized Crime Bif/

(supra) relates to such an exceptional case. The Supreme Court in Ref

Prevention of Organized "rime Bill (supra) in fact contrasted the

serious nature of the offenc,f!s in Re: Prevention of Organized Crime

Bill (supra) with far lesse'", serious offences in Re: Prohibition of

I I Ragging and Other Forms 9f Violence in Educational Institutions Bill

.'

f.

I

(supra). A minimum manda 'ory punishment of appropriate severity

for such serious offences wOHld not be inconsistent with Articles 4(c),

11 and 12(1). " t "

I In light of the above decisions, it is unde~stood that Court has discretion to impose , an appropriate sentence, even if it is\Jelow a minimum mandatory sentence,

considering the facts of each case. We ob!Jcrve section 303 of the Code of Criminal

.. Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 as amended by Act No. 47 of 1999 which stipulates

that; L

303. (1) Subject tu the provisions 9f this section, on sentencing an offender

to a term of imprisonment, a court }nay make an order suspending the whole

or part of the sentence if it is satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing,

that it is appropriate to do so in the. circumstances, having regard to -

(a) the maximum penalty prescrib'd for the offence in respect of which the

sentence is imposed ;

I (b) the nature and gravity of the ojj.ince;

(d) the offender's previous charact~!r;

(h) the need to deter the offender d'i' other persons from committing offences

of the same or of a similar charactt r;

0) the need to protect the victim m the community from the offender;

(2) A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment if-

(a) a mandatory minimum senten,:e of imprisonment has been prescribed

by law for the offence in respect 0/ which the sentence is imposed; or

Page t) of 16

(b) the offender is serving, or is yet to serve, a term of imprisonment that has

not been suspended; or ... " (Emph4sis added)

Since section 365B (2) (b) carries a minimum mandatory sentence we are of the

( view that, in the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge should have imposed ~

custodial sentence. We observe that w11en the Learned High Court judge was

.'1 imposing the sentence, he had considere(,.. 'the age of the petitioner, the fact that the

petitioner had no previous convictions , and the fact that the petitioner pleaded

guilty to the offence at first instance tHereby saving the valuable time of Court.

! However upon perusal of the proceediugs we observe that the indictment was

handed over to the petitioner on 28.1 0.201 0 and the petitioner was ordered to be

" released on bail. On next date i.e. 13.'12.2010 the petitioner was absent and a

warrant was issued on him. According~y he was arrested and produced before

Court on 12.05.2011. On 17.06.2011 "tile case was called in order to consider

granting bail and the Learned State Counsel had objected to the same. On

01.07.2011 the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha had cancelled previous baH

conditions and had imposed heavy bail c(,mditions (Page 39 of the brief). (,

On 25.10.2011 the Learned High Courf;Judge had fixed the trial for 11.05.201i

On that day the indictment was served in open Court and a Counsel was assigned

for the petitioner by the Government. Th1ereafter the trial was fixed for 30.07.2012

and the witnesses were summoned as w'~11. However we observe that the trial waS

not commenced on that day. On 28.08.2013 and 15.11.2013 the Learned Counsel

, . for the petitioner who appeared in High qourt had moved for further time since he

, had not received instructions from the peritioner.

(Page 46 and 47 of the brief)

Thereafter on 23.03.2016 the petitioner hhd infonned his willingness to adopt a

shortcut and the petitioner had pleaded guilty to the amended indictment. We

observe that on every occasion the witnesses and the victim were present in Court.

The petitioner had decided to plead guilty only after moving dates for a period of

almost 05 years. Therefore we are unal:'le to agree with the reasoning of the

Learned High Court Judge that the pet~.(oner saved valuable time of Court by

" pleading guilty at first instance.

In the case of Attorney General V. Mayagodage Sanath Dharmadiri Perera

[CA (PHC) APN 147/2012], it was held that,

I "On the other hand this is not a fit. case to order suspended sentence. The

nature and the gravity of the offence;,have to be ~onsidered before ordering a

suspended sentence. The victim is distant relation of the accused. She has

referred to the accused as "Sanath J1ama" which means uncle. A person in

'\ that position is expected to protect a'person like the victim who was a school

.~

Page 9 iof 16

.

I

~ going child at the time of the incident. Instead of protecting her, he has

committed a sexual offence, rape, on her. At that time also he was a married

person with two children. Thesefactors necessitate the imposition of a ) custodial long term punishment, nq( a suspended sentence.

The counsel for the Accused submitted that the accused had pleaded guilty

;:'. I and it has to be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing. There is no

doubt that it is. It has shortened the trial 'and it helps to clear the backlog of

cases in Court. But as per the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

Accused in the High Court, he had pleaded guilty only for the purpose of

\. preventing the wastage of the pre ~ious time of Court. He has not pleaded

guilty on admitting the crime that! ~e has committed and on being regretful

of what he has done. Pleading g~~lty can be considered under section 303

(1) (k) only if he is sincerely andftruly repentant of what he has done. The

,I sec section reads thus;

\ (k) the fact that the person arcused of the offence pleaded guilty to the

offence and such person is sij'1cerely and truly repentant; or

The time of Court is precious, but';.ttilizing that precious time for dispensing

justice is not wastage. Therefore, tile Accused will get only a minor discount

for pleading guilty to prevent the W(A.stage of Court's time. "

, We observe that the victim in the instar:.t case was a boy of 13 years at the time of

\ offence and the petitioner was a 39 ye . .lrs old married person. The victim was

subject to grave sexual abuse when he :,wasflying kites in the evening and the

". I!' petitioner had threatened the victim after'abusing him. The Medico-Legal report (at

page 07 of the brief) reveals that the fil!ldings were compatible with recent anal

, penetration.

It was held in the case of Attorney General V. Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and

another [1995] 1 Sri L.R 157 that;

"In determining the proper sentenr~'e the Judge should consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from th(; nature of the act itself and should have

i, regard to the punishment provided /n the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the . , punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature o/which the offender has been found guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The Judge should also take into account the nature of the loss

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

detection ... "

In the case of The Attorney General V.JI.N. de Silva [57 NLR 121, it was held

that,

"In assessing the punishment that ~ hould be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sent;ence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offenc.er. A Judge should, in determining th(~

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and 'should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or o!Aer statute under which the offender is , charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will i e effective ... "

I

In the case of Hirimuthugoda Sanjeew.~ l Shantha alias Ran Mama (supra) it

was further held that,

"The damage caused to the vict.:'m mentally and physically cannot be

compensated by payment of moneY'lllone. It is the mental trauma that could

:i shape or destroy or weaken the lif~ of the victim in the subsequent year of

victim IS life ... "

After considering the gravity of the offeri:e and the physical and mental damage

caused to the child, we are of the view that only paying compensation to the victim

will not be sufficient and a perpetrator wjth such a mentality should be confined

for a certain time as well. 1 The Learned Counsel for the petitioner c/mtended that per incuriam rule was not

applicable to the judgment dated 23.03.2016 and therefore the Learned succeeding

High Court Judge was not empowered to \ ary the said judgment.

We observe that dates were granted fOft, the petitioner to pay the fine and the

',\ ;. compensation but he had failed to do )~;o. The case was postponed on three

occasions and the victim was present in Court to collect the compensation on all

I three days. On 26.09.2016 the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha had issued a

warrant on the petitioner and accordingly he was arrested and produced before

Court on 26.10.2016. After considering the gravity of the offence and the

behaviour of the petitioner, the Learned High Court Judge had set aside the order

., dated 23.03.2016 and had imposed a term pf 7 years imprisonment for each charge

(which is the minimum mandatory fentence) and directed the terms of

imprisonment to run consecutively. Additionally a compensation of Rs. 50,0001=

\ was ordered to be paid to the victim.

Page 1~ . of 16

..

In the case of Hettiarachchi V. Senevi ratne, Deputy Bribery Commissioner

and others (No.02) [1994] 3 Sri L.R. 29J, it was held that,

1

"It is a well-established rule in general a Court cannot re-hear, review,

alter or vary its own judgment ond~ delivered. The rationale of that rule is

{ that there must be finality to litigation ... it may, of course, have a limited

power to clarify its judgment and tf correct accidental slips or omissions ... "

' . If In the case of Jeyaraj Fernandopulle ,T. Premachandra De Silva and others

[1996] 1 Sri L.R 70, it was held that,

"As a general rule, no Court has power to rehear, review, alter or vary any

judgment or order made by it ajter !U has been entered ... However all Courts

have inherent power in certain ci~cumstances to revise an order made by

them such as -~,

1

(i) An order which has not attained finality according to the law or practice

obtaining in a Court can be revokid or recalled by the Judge or Judges who

made the order, acting with discretion exercised judicially and not

capriciously.

(ii) When a person invokes the exercise of inherent powers of the Court, two

" questions must be asked by the Coui~t.

(a) Is it a case which comes ,:vithin the scope of the inherent powers of

court?

(b) Is it one in which those puwers should be exercised?

i';

(iii) A clerical mistake in a judgment or order or some error arising in a .. judgment or order from an accid(ntal slip or omission may be corrected. .

tf' Page n of 16

(iv) A Court has power to vary its own orders in such a way-as to carry out

its own meaning and where the 1C}. :~guage is doubtful, to make it plain or to

amend it where a party has beeniwrongly named or described but not if it

would change the substance of thr/judgment ... "

i.

. \

In the case of Senarath V. Chandraratne, Commissioner of Excise and other$

I . [1995] 1 Sri L.R. 209, it was held that, . !

"In general the Court cannot re-hear, review, alter or vary such decision.

However the Court has limited po. ~er to clarify its judgment and to correct

accidental slips or omissions ... " ~

In light of the above it is understood that Court has a very limited power to clarify

its own judgments other than given in per incuriam. The Learned succeeding High

Court Judge should have either imposed the default sentence or imposed the

custodial sentence or should have done both. Therefore we are of the view that the

Learned succeeding High Court Judge was not empowered to set aside the

judgment delivered by the preceding Hi~h Court Judge.

'i In the case of W.M.F.G. Fernando V. Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.1108/99 (F)], it was held that,

"It is trite law that the purpose 0 . revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory il1

i ' nature, and that the object is i he proper administration of justice. In

Attorney General v GunawardefJa (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

"Revision, like an appeal, is direc(~d towards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its ~~ject is the due administration of justice

.. ', and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a partY 'who is entitled to it, may claim to have a~

Page ,j 4 of 16 '.

, .

of right, and its object is the grant Gfreliefto a party aggrieved by an order

of court which is tainted by error. .. '1

In the case of Mariam Beebee V. Seyed l\:Iohamed [68 NLR 36] it was held that,

., , "The power of revision is an extraohiinary power which is quite independent

,-of and distinct from the appellate jtirisdiction of this court. Its object is the

due administration of justice anq the correction of errors, sometimes

\ committed by this court itself, in ordqr to avoid a miscarriage of justice ... "

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel ,.ind others [2004] 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionalY jurisdiction the order challenged must , have occasioned a failure of justic~; and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order cf mplained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience :~f court. "

\ Considering above, we are of the view thit there had been a miscarriage of justice

which warrants this Court to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore we

decide to set aside both judgments dated~ \ 23.03.2016 and 26.10.2016 in case No.

HC 74/2010.

, We impose the following sentences on thej petitioner;

Charge 01 - A term of 7 years rigor;ous imprisonment

Charge 02 - A term of 7 years rigorpus imprisonment

Fine of Rs. 5000/= for each char5e with a default sentence of 6 months

_ simple imprisonment.

Page 1,s. of 16

.'

"

We order the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently. Additionally we order the

1 petitioner to pay compensation of Rs. 50,600/= to the. victim on each charge and if

default a term of 12 months rigorous impr~,sonment on each charge.

I Subject to above variation of the sentence ~ the revision application is allowed.
