Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court to partition the

land known as Hitinaawatta between the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant. At the preliminary survey the 2nd defendant presented

himself as a claimant. The Preliminary Plan was marked as Y at

the trial.1 The 2nd defendant does not claim any rights from

Hitinaawatta. He claims rights from the lands known as

Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura lying to the South of

Hitinaawatta.2 The only issue raised by the 2nd defendant before

the District Court was to exclude Lots 3-5 of the Preliminary Plan

from the corpus on the basis that those three Lots belong to

Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura. The learned District

Judge in the Judgment has rejected that claim and decided that

those three Lots also form part of the land sought to be partitioned,

that is, Hitinaawatta. It is against that Judgment the 2nd

defendant has preferred this appeal.

It is clear from the evidence of the 2nd defendant that, at the time

he was giving evidence, there had been a partition case pending

before the same District Court (Case No. 25255/P) to partition the

said lands known as Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura.

The 2nd defendant is also a party to that partition action. The

Preliminary Plan prepared for that partition case has been marked

as P6 through the evidence of the 2nd defendant.3 The 2nd

defendant in his evidence has clearly admitted that Lots 3-5 in the

Preliminary Plan of the present case was not shown as part of

Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura in that partition action 1 Vide page 198 of the Brief. 2 Vide the southern boundary of the Preliminary Plan at page 198 of the Brief. 3 Vide page 151 of the Brief.

No. 25255/P which was filed to partition Aluthwatta and

Delgahapurane Kumbura.4 The plaintiff in that partition action is

one Tikiri Appu Wijesinghe. The 1st defendant in the present

action also seems to be a party to that partition action. Tikiri

Appu and the 1st defendant do not say that Lots 3-5 in the

Preliminary Plan of the present case are parts of Aluthwatta and

Delgahapurane Kumbura. This is relevant for the reason that the

2nd defendant is not the sole owner of Aluthwatta and

Delgahapurane Kumbura. It is a co-owned land. It appears from

the evidence of the 2nd defendant that the 2nd defendant sought to

take out a commission to show Lots 3-5 of the Preliminary Plan of

the present case as part of Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane

Kumbura in the other partition case.5 However, it is not clear

whether the 2nd defendant pursued that application. By now that

partition action, which was filed to partition Aluthwatta and

Delgahapurane Kumbura, must have been concluded. If the 2nd

defendant thought that Lots 3-5 of the Preliminary Plan of the

present case are parts of Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura

which is the subject matter in the then pending partition action

No.25255/P, he should have made that application in that case.

There is no doubt that the land depicted in Plan P6, which is the

Preliminary Plan in the other case, is the southern boundary of the

Preliminary Plan in this case marked Y. That has been admitted

by the 2nd defendant in cross examination.6 There is no necessity

to have a superimposition done to understand it.

Against that strong evidence, in my view, there is no necessity to

consider the exact location of the Endaru fence, which separated

Hitinaawatta from Aluthwatta and Delgahapurane Kumbura. The

plaintiff has given evidence to say that it was along the southern

boundary of Plan Y, but the 2nd defendant in 1970s destroyed it,

and he complained it to the police. The position of the 2nd

defendant is that the Endaru fence was along the northern

boundary of Lots 3-5 of the Preliminary Plan of this case and the

plaintiff destroyed it, and he made a complaint to the Grama

Sevaka about it. Neither party has marked the said complaints at

the trial. In the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned

District Judge cannot be found fault with accepting the version of

the plaintiff in that regard.

This appeal of the 2nd defendant is dismissed with costs.
