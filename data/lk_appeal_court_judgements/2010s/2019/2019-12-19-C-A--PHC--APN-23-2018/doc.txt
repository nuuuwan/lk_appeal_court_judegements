K.K.WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Accused-Petitioners filed this revision application seeking to revise and set

aside the sentencing order of the Learned High Court Judge of dated 17.10.2017 in

case No. HC 287/2006.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioners') with 06 others

were indicted in the High Court of Negambo under 05 charges, which were

punishable under sections 140, 296 and 300 read with section 146 and 32 of the

Penal Code. The petitioners pleaded not guilty for the charges and stood for trial.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court judge found that the 01 st,

03'd, 04'h, OSlh, 06'\ 07'h and 081h accused persons were guilty for lessor culpability

of Culpable homicide not amounting to Murder, an offence punishable under

section 297 of the penal code.

Thereafter, the following sentences were imposed on the said petitioners;

For the 01s' charge (Section 140 of the Penal Code) - One year rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2S00/= with a default sentence of 3 months

simple imprisonment

For the 2nd charge (Section 296 read with 146 of the Penal Code) - 07

years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.SOOO/= with a default sentence

of 6 months simple imprisonment. Further, a sum of Rs.IO,OOO/= was

ordered to be paid as compensation to the wife of the deceased with a default

sentence of 0 1 year simple imprisonment.

For the 3'd charge (Section 300 read with 146 of the Penal Code) - One

year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2S00/= with a default sentence

Page 3 of 13

of 3 months simple imprisonment. Furtber, a sum ofRs. 2500/= was ordered

to be paid to the PW 02 with a default sentence of 3 months simple

imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge directed the said sentences to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 04th, 06th and osth accused-petitioners

preferred this revision application.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners submitted that since the

petitioners were committed to prison custody immediately after the conviction,

they could not instruct either their Counselor members of the family to file

petitions of appeal against the sentencing order and therefore, they filed this

revision application challenging the sentencing order.

The Learned SSC for the complainant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') raised preliminary objections including the delay in filing the

application. It was submitted that there is a delay on months.

However, since I observe that there is a question of law that needs to be addressed,

I decide to go to the merits of the case after overruling the preliminary objections

raised by the Learned SSC.

The incident in question can b~ summarized as follows;

The deceased person (Nimal Wijesiri) and the injured person, Ranjith Premalal

(PW 02) were two brothers. As per the prosecution evidence, there had been

quarrels between the victimized party and the petitioners. On the date of the

incident, the petitioners had come to the deceased's house and attacked the

deceased and his brother with clubs. The 1 st accused had stabbed the deceased. The

prosecution led evidence of eye witnesses and medical evidence.

Page 4 of 13

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitipners, mainly raised two questions in

the written submissions;

1. Whether the sentence imposed on the petitioners for charge 01 is legal.

2. Whether sentencing all the convicted accused including petitioners for 07

years rigorous imprisonment for 2nd charge is excessive and/or irrational.

It was submitted that the sentence imposed for the first count is illegal and

excessive since section 140 of the Penal Code prescribes that "Whoever is a

member of an unlawful assembly shall be punished with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to six months or with fine, or with both. "

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge has imposed a term of one-year

rigorous imprisonment on the petitioners, for the charge No. 01. However, as the

Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners pointed out, section 140 only

allows imposing a term of imprisonment which may be extended to six months.

Therefore, it is manifestly clear that the Learned High Court Judge erred by

imposing a term of one year imprisonment for the charge 01, which is contrary to

section 140 of the Penal Code. Therefore, I answer the first question of law in

affirmative.

In the second question, it was argued that petitioners' acts and/or participation is

different from other accused persons and therefore, their liability would have been

considered in a different manner. The Learned President's Counsel for the

petitioners brought to the attention of this Court about the difference as to

sentencing in Murder and Culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Further,

the differences on Common Intention and Unlawful Assembly with implication on

sentencing were submitted. The Learned President's Counsel submitted that in

order to find liability under section 32, intention must be shared and all the accused

Page 5 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

persons must have not only a guilty mind, put must actively take part with its

presence. Accordingly, it was submitted that Mens Rea of Unlawful assembly is

lesser than the mindset of Common intention.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners further contended that all the

petitioners have been punished with the same sentence even when the evidence

clearly shows it was the 01

51 accused who stabbed with a dangerous weapon. It was

submitted that the petitioners never used a "dangerous weapon".

As per the judgement, the Learned High Court Judge found the petitioners guilty of

committing an offence punishable under section 297, while being members of an

unlawful assembly.

Section 146 reads that;

"If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in

prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members

of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that

object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a

member of the same assembly is guilty of that offence. "

In the case of Vithanalage Anura Thushara De Mel and 03 others V. The

Attorney General [SCITAB/2A - D/2017 - decided on 11.10.2018], it was held

that,

"The first requisite for imposing liability under section 146 of the Penal

Code is that the person sought to be held liable for the act of another should

have been at the time of the commission of the offence a member of the

unlawful assembly. The liability will extend not only to offence committed in

prosecution of the common object but also to offences which the members of

the assembly knew to be likely committed in prosecution of that object ... "

Page 6 of 13

Therefore, if an accused knew common obje<;t is likely to be happened, then such

person shall be liable under section 146 of the Penal Code. As stipulated in section

146, if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in

prosecution of the common object of the assembly, every person of the same

assembly is guilty of the offence.

It is observed that as per charge 01 to 03, the common object of the instant case

was to cause injury to Nimal Wijesiri (the deceased), and to Ranjith Premalal (PW

02). Since the accused-persons had acted and conducted themselves in furtherance

of achieving the common object of the assembly, I am of the view that the fact that

these three petitioners did not use a dangerous weapon is irrelevant. Therefore, I

answer the above contention of the Learned President's Counsel in negative.

The Learned SSC for the respondent submitted that the Learned High Court Judge

rightfully analyzed the evidence and having considered all aggravating factors and

migratory factors, has imposed the rightful sentence on the petitioners. It was

further argued that the petitioners have committed the offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder and the circumstances transpire that the

petitioners had committed the offence of criminal trespass and offences of this

nature should not be considered lightly.

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment has mentioned that

the petitioners were convicted under section 297 of the Penal Code considering the

4th exception to section 294 of the Penal Code. Section 297 of the Penal Code

which deals with the punishment of Culpable homicide states that "Whoever

commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to twenty years,

and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is caused is done with

Page 7 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

the intention of causing death, or of causing slJch bodily injury as is likely to cause

death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten

years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is

likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such

bodily injury as is likely to cause death. "

The mentioned section 297 gives a wider discretion to the judge to impose a

sentence which is either extends to twenty years or ten 'years, depending on the

culpability of the accused.

Even the Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners submitted that in both

situations of culpable homicide not amounting murder, the Learned Trial Judge has

a wider discretion of sentence of imprisonment from even a single day extending to

10 or 20 years.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioners further submitted that the

petitioners took part to commit the offence described in charge 03 (not murder) and

therefore, their sentence should be focused on 3rd charge than on the 2nd charge.

However, since the petitioners had only challenged the sentence imposed, I am

inclined to consider whether the Learned High Court Judge had imposed a lawful

sentence.

In the case of W.M.F.G. Fernando V. Rev Sr. Marie Bernard and others

[C.A.ll08/99 (F)], it was held that,

"It is trite law that the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory in

nature, and that the object is the proper administration of justice. In

Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that:

Page 8 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed to}Vards the correction of errors, but it

is supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice

and not, primarily or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An

appeal is a remedy, which a party who is entitled to it, may claim to have as

of right, and its object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order

of court which is tainted by error ... "

The purpose of revisionary power is to correct errors committed by lower Courts

and such power shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances like miscarriage of justice. Therefore, this Court shall not interfere

with an order of lower Court unless there had been an illegality or irregularity and

revisionary powers cannot be invoked to relieve grievances of parties. The

revisionary powers cannot be exercised in a similar manner like in an appeal and

therefore, I wish to consider only the legality of the sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge in the instant case.

It was held in the case of Attorney General V. Jinak Sri U1uwaduge and

another [1995] 1 Sri L.R 157 that,

"In determining the proper sentence the Judge should consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The Judge should also take into account the nature of the loss

Page 9 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

detection ... "

In the case of The Attorney General V. H.N. de Silva [57 NLR 121), it was held

that,

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective ... "

In,the case ofPitiduwa Gamage Sumith Rohana V. Hon. Attorney General and

two others [CALA 06/2013 - decided on 25.01.2016), it was observed that,

"Some of the aggravating and mitigatory factors identified by our courts in

the cases referred to above can be summarized as follows,

Aggravating factors,

a) Use of violence when committing crime

b) Use of weapons when committing crime

c) Drug related offences

d) Member of an organized gang

e) Repeating acts of similar offence

j) Previous convictions or pending cases of the similar type

g) Effect upon victims physical or mental condition

Page 10 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

h) Obstruction of justice

i) Commission of an offence while on bail

j) Willful damage to state or private property

k) Disruption of governmental functions

I) Commits the offence in order to conceal another offence

m) Using high office to commit the offence

Mitigatory factors,

a) First offender

b) Good character

c) Determination to quit the criminal life

d) Serious medical condition

e) Victims conduct

j) Lesser harm (crime committed to avoid greater harm)

g) Coercion and/or duress

h) Voluntary disclosure of offence"

In the case of Sevaka Perumal etc. V. State of Tamil Nadu [AIR 1991 S.c.

1463], it was held that,

" ... Protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the

object of law which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.

Therefore, law as a corner-stone of the edifice of order should meet the

challenges confronting the society ... Therefore, undue sympathy to impose

inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine

the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long

endure under serious threats. If the court did not protect the injured, the

ihjured would then resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore, the duty of

Page 11 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

"

every court to award proper sentence. having regard to the nature of the

offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc ... "

In light of above, it is understood that after convicting an accused, the Trial Judge

has a duty of imposing a proportionate sentence on the convicted person, keeping

in mind about the aggravating and mitigatory factors.

In the instant case, the petitioners had initially committed criminal trespass by

entering into the property of another with common objective of causing injury to

the deceased and his brother. Upon perusal of the evidenc-e and the judgment, I am

of the view that the instant case has more aggravating factors than mitigatory

factors. The Learned High Court Judge has mentioned that she proceeded to

impose the sentence, after considering the fact that a 40-year-old person, who was

a father of 04 children had lost his life due to the acts of the petitioners. The

Learned High Court Judge was empowered to impose a term which may be

extended to 10 years or to 20 years and she had accordingly imposed a term of 07

years rigorous imprisonment on the petitioners. The said sentence is clearly within

law.

Therefore, I am of the view that revisionary powers should not be invoked to

interfere with the decision of the Learned High Court Judge where she had

judicially exercised the discretionary powers vested on her.

The Learned SSC for the respondent invited this Court to consider enhancing the

sentences imposed on the petitioners. However, I am of the view that the Learned

High Court Judge has imposed adequate sentences on the petitioners. Therefore, I

do not wish to make any order on that point.

As I have mentioned under the first question of law raised on behalf of the

petitioners, I order to bring down the one-year rigorous imprisonment to a term of

Page 12 of 13

Website Copy Website Copy

06 months rigorous imprisonment, for charge,No. Ol. Sentences on the other two

charges are affirmed.

Subject to the above variation, the revision application is hereby dismissed without

costs.
