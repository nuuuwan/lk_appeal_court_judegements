The Registered Owner-Petitioner-Petitioner filed this revision application seeking

to set aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle dated 31 st

October 2018 bearing case No. 5266/2017 and seeking to set aside the confiscation

order of the Learned Magistrate of War aka pol a bearing Case No. 90515 dated 27th

September 2017.

Facts of the case:

The Vehicle bearing No. 68-4469 was taken into custody by the Complainant for

allegedly transporting timber without a valid permit on or about the 26th of April

2017.

The driver of the vehicle was charged for transportation of timber which IS

punishable under Section 25 (2) (b) of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

The driver (Accused) pleaded guilty for the c,harge and was convicted on his own

plea and accordingly, the Learned Magistrate of Warakapola convicted him and

imposed a fine of Rs.25, 0001-, in default 3 months rigorous imprisonment.

Further, the case was fixed for inquiry regarding the aforesaid vehicle on the 28th

of June, 2017.

On the 3rd May 2017, the aforesaid vehicle was released to the petitioner

(Registered-Owner of the vehicle) after furnishing the vehicle registration

certificate, on a bond ofRs. 1,500,0001-.

The inquiry regarding the vehicle commenced on 28 June 2017 and evidence of the

Registered-Owner was led. After the inquiry on 27thSeptember 2017, the learned

Magistrate confiscated the Vehicle bearing No. 68-4469.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court of Kegalle. Thereafter, by Order dated 31 st

October 2018, the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the Revision Application

on the basis that no exceptional circumstances have been alleged by the petitioner

and affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the Petitioner

filed this revision application to invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court.

The following grounds of revision were averred on behalf of the petitioner;

I. That the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the totality of

evidence lead at the inquiry.

11. That the learned High Court failed to consider that the learned Magistrate

came to a finding on the element of knowledge based on evidence that

Page 4 of 8

had been led, namely that the Pet\tioner did not have any knowledge

when committing the alleged offence.

Ill. That the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the

Petitioner did not have knowledge is sufficient to release the vehicle to

the Petitioner..

IV. That the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the Petitioner

failed to aver exceptional grounds which warrants the jurisdiction of the

High Court.

I observe that the first ground of appeal was correctly addressed by the Learned

High Court Judge in his order. The Learned High Court Judge has compared law

relevant to confiscating a vehicle under the Forest Ordinance prior to, and

subsequent to the Amending Act No. 65 of 2009. Furthermore, this question oflaw

was addressed in light of case law. The Learned High Court Judge was of the view

that the burden cast on a vehicle owner under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as

amended by Act No. 65 of 2009, is not very different from previously held law, in

which an owner had to prove: that he either took all precautions to avert such a

situation, or that he had no knowledge of an offence being committed. It is

observed that proving all necessary precautions having been taken by the owner of

a vehicle has in fact remained a requirement under both past and present law.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge arrived at the correct conclusion that no

prejudice had been caused to the petitioner.

When considering the fourth ground of appeal referring to the existence of

exceptional circumstances, Rasheed Ali Vs Mohamed Ali (1936, 6 CLW) held,

"The powers 0/ revision con/erred on the Court 0/ Appeal are very wide and

the Court has the discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not

or whether an appeal had been taken or not. However, this discretionary

Page 5 of8

Website Copy Website Copy

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the Court. "

Furthermore, in the case of Caderamanpule Vs Ceylon Paper Sacks ltd. 2001

(3) SLR 112, It was held that "the existence of exceptional circumstances is

precondition for the exercise of the powers of Revision"

Thus, I observe that the learned High Court Judge had not erred in Law, as there

had been no exceptional circumstances brought to light that would justify the

exercise of the powers of Revision.

The Witnesses who testified at the Vehicle inquiry are as follows:

1. The registered owner of the vehicle

2. The accused

3. The owner of the timber

Mallika Wijelath, the registered owner, in her evidence, she confirmed that she is

the registered owner of the Vehicle bearing no. 68-4469 and had hired the Driver

(accused) 2 months prior to the said incident. Further, she testified that she had

provided the accused with instructions to refrain from doing any illegal acts whilst

using the aforementioned vehicle.

However, she had not taken or purported to take any further steps in ensuring the

driver not commit such an offence.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on a balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was

Page 6 of 8

Website Copy Website Copy

committed without his knowledge nor h,e was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

In terms of Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended, if the owner of the

vehicle in question was a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that

owner has proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions

to prevent the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence.

Accordingly, it would be necessary for the owner to show the steps he had taken to

prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the .offence and that the said

offence had been committed without his knowledge.

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva, V. P.R De Silva ICA (PRC) 86/971]

Sisira De Abrew, J has stated that,

"For these reasons I hold that giving mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the

instructions ... "

However, Section 40 of the principal enactment has been amended by the repeal of

subsection (l) and thereby the petitioner must only prove that she has taken

necessary precautions to avert such wrongdoing.

In the case of W. JaJathge Surasena V. O.I.C, Rikkaduwa and 3 others ICA

(PRC) APNIOO/2014], it was held that a mere denial by the registered owner of

the fact that he did not have knowledge of the alleged commission is not sufficient.

I observe that it is evident that the petitioner had failed to take all reasonable

precautions to ensure the said vehicle was not used in commission of the offence,

since merely instructing the accused to refrain from partaking in illegal activities

does not suffice in ensuring the proper use of a vehicle.

Therefore, I observe that the Learned Magis~rate has correctly followed the legal

principles governing a claim made by the Registered Owner.

F or the aforesaid reasons, the order of the High Court dated 31 st October 2018 is

therefore affirmed.

The revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
