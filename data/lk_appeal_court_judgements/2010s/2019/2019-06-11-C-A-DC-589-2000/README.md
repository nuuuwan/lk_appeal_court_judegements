Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against her husband (who were

living separately at that time and later divorced) seeking a

declaration that she is the owner of the premises in suit or the

defendant is holding the premises in trust for her, ejectment of

the defendant therefrom and damages. The defendant filed the

answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a

declaration that he is the owner of the premises. After trial the

learned District Judge held with the plaintiff. Hence this appeal

by the defendant.

The plaintiff was an employee of the Central Bank. The

premises were purchased from the Commissioner of National

Housing. All correspondence with the Commissioner of National

Housing both before and after the purchase was by the plaintiff.

It is the plaintiff who mortgaged the premises to the Central

Bank to obtain a loan.

It is significant to note that in all correspondence marked at

trial, the plaintiff has used as her name, her husbands name,

N.L.A. Karunaratne, with the prefix Mrs. in front as that had

been the practice of the Central Bank for administrative

purposes, which has later been changed by the Bank because of

this disputevide P51 (at page 897 of the brief).

By P12 dated 03.01.1977 (at page 541 of the brief), the plaintiff

in reply to the letter P11 sent by the Commissioner of National

Housing, has given her full name as Mrs. Nilakarawasam

Lankadewa Ariyapala Karunaratne to be included as the

grantee in the instrument of disposition (the deed). However in

the said instrument of disposition marked P19 dated 21.04.1977

3

(at page 550), obviously by clerical mistake, the prefix Mrs. has

been omitted, and the name of the grantee has been mentioned

as Nilakarawasam Lankadewa Ariyapala Karunaratne. This

has later been rectified by the Commissioner of National

Housing by deed of rectification marked P18 (at page 547).

The defendant has tried to take advantage of this mistake and

claimed that he is the owner of the premises and the deed of

rectification is illegal. The defendant has not invoked writ

jurisdiction of this Court against that move if he thought that

the said rectification of the Commissioner of National Housing

was illegal.

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

defendant-appellant before this Court is that, in terms of section

59 of the National Housing Act, No.37 of 1954, as amended, any

rectification to the original instrument can be made only (a) with

the participation of the grantee and (b) on the instrument itself,

and, in this instance, as the defendant has not been informed,

and the rectification has not been done on the instrument itself,

the deed of rectification is bad in law.

I am unable to agree with this argument.

Section 59 reads as follows:

Where the instrument of disposition of any State land under

this Act contains any clerical or other error or requires

amendment in respect of the description of that land or in

respect of the inscription or recital of the name or

designation of the grantee under such instrument or of any

other material fact, such error may be rectified or such

amendment may be made by an endorsement on such

4

instrument signed by the appropriate authority and such

grantee; and any endorsement so signed shall be sufficient

for all purposes to rectify the error or to effect the

amendment; and the instrument on which any such

endorsement is made shall have effect as though it had

been originally executed as so rectified or amended.

Firstly, if that argument to be considered, the Commissioner of

National Housing shall be a necessary party. But he has not

been made a party. Without him being given a hearing, his

decision cannot be reversed.

Secondly, in terms of section 59 of the National Housing Act,

only the grantee shall participate in the process of rectifying the

clerical or other error in the instrument. The grantee of the

instrument, according to the Commissioner of National Housing,

is the plaintiff, and therefore there was no necessity to notice the

defendant about it.

Thirdly, rectification, in terms of section 59, can be done on the

instrument itself by way of an endorsement. But there is no

prohibition for the Commissioner of National Housing to do it by

way of a deed of rectification if he has the necessary wherewithal

at his disposal.

There is no necessity to consider the trust pleaded by the

plaintiff as an alternative cause of action.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant further draws

the attention of this Court to the issue No.10 raised in the

middle of the trial (at page 359 of the brief) whereby it was

suggested that the plaintiff cannot maintain the action as her

name has been changed. In that regard what I have to state in

5

short is actions are filed not by or against the names but against

the parties designated by names and therefore if there is no

dispute regarding identification of the party change of the name

is immaterial.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
