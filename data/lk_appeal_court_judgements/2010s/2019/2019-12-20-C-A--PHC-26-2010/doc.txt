The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter-alia, to have the judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy, dated 09/02/20 lO,

set aside and for relief in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions

contained in documents marked 'X13' and 'XIO' made by the 2nd and 3rd

Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Respondents)

respectively.

The Appellant was employed as a store keeper by the 1

st Respondent from

1110511987 to 14/0211998. Due to a loss in stock, in store, the Appellants services

were terminated on 14/0211998 (as reflected in the impugned decision marked

XIO at page 341 of the brief). The Appellant thereafter instituted action in the

Labour Tribunal, where it was held that the termination of service is unjustified

and accordingly, the Appellant was awarded compensation. The appeal instituted

in the High Court was dismissed with a variation to the compensation awarded to

the Appellant. At the time the said proceedings were pending the 1st Respondent

preferred an application to the 2nd Respondent to recover the amounts due on the

short fall in stock as constituted in charge No. 6.1 of the charge sheet.

The 2nd Respondent referred the said matter to Arbitration In terms of

Section 58(1) of the Cooperative Societies Statute of the Central Provincial

Council No. 10 of 1990. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Arbitrator made

award making the Appellant liable to pay Rs. 365,5001- . The Appellant appealed

against the said award to the 2nd Respondent in terms of the said statute and after

consideration, the matter was referred to a fresh Arbitration to be conducted by the

3rd Respondent. By documents marked 'Rl ' and as stated in proceedings marked

'R3', Appellant objected to the legality and fairness of proceeding to commence a

Page 3 of 9

fresh arbitration. At the conclusion of the said arbitration by award dated

20109/2004, the Appellant was made liable to pay Rs. 414,865/25 together with

interest thereon at 18% per annum. The above stated chronology of events are not

in dispute.

The Appellant is before this Court to challenge the following that;

the order of the Labour Tribunal and the judgment of the High Court would

operate as res-judicata on the Arbitrator.

the 2nd Respondent had no right in law to refer the same matter for a second

Arbitration.

The main contention of the Appellant is that the orders given by the Labour

Tribunal and the High Court operates as Res Judicata and binds the 2nd and 3'd

Respondents making further orders on already determined issues and therefore, the

impugned orders marked 'XIO' and 'X13' are invalid in law. In support the

learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the alleged shortage of goods was

inquired into and the Appellant after due process was exonerated by the Labour

Tribunal and the High Court and therefore, the Arbitrator appointed by the 2nd

Respondent did not have the power to re-commence proceedings since the former

proceedings against the appellant would operate as Res Judicata.

It is not disputed that the reference to a fresh arbitration was on the

identical charge No. 6.1 served on the Appe llant at the inquiry held by the 2nd

Respondent. where the Appellant was found guilty of the charges and accordingly,

Page 4 of 9

his services were terminated. The Appellant thereafter filed action in the Labour

Tribunal against the termination of employment. With a variation to the number of

years of back wages due, finality was reached in the said action in the High Court.

Charge No. 6.1 of the charge sheet refers to inter-alia, the time period of the short

fall due to misappropriation of goods and the amount to be recovered as a result of

losses suffered by the 1st Respondent. The said charge quantifies the loss suffered

by the said Respondent, which contemplates the alleged fraudulent act committed

by the Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant relying on Stassen Exports Ltd. Vs.

Lipton Ltd. and another (2009) 2 SLR 172, submits that the said case is on all

fours on the issue before Court, where a judicial pronouncement would act as a bar

against the 2nd Respondents authority to hear and determine a matter that had been

already decided by the Labour Tribunal and the High Court. It is to be noted that

in the cited case "the dispute between the Appellant and the ]st Respondent was

fully decided by the Court of Appeal on the identical questions which later came

up before the 2nd Respondent ".

In this context the learned State Counsel submits that, the proceedings held

before the Labour Tribunal and the Arbitrator needs to be considered in its

perspective and submits that the proceedings relate to two separate and

distinguishable actions brought against the Appellant. It is further submitted that

"the core issue revolves around the fact as to whether the Appellant is liable for

Page 5 of 9

loss of stocks subsequent to the material time period which is from 1410211998 to

191021 1998 n The subsequent proceedings before the Arbitrator dealt with the

issue of recovery of money which were due from the Appellant to the I sl

Respondent for loss of goods after termination of service, as retlected at the time

of closure of the stock account. Therefore, the impugned award marked 'X I 0',

relating to the subsequent proceeding inter-alia, dealt with transactions authorized

by the Appellant after his termination of service.

By order dated 27/0112004, the learned High Court Judge has clearly

identified 0110111998 to 1910211998, as the time period which the alleged offence

was committed by the Appellant (at page 242 of the brief). Therefore, it is

absolutely clear that the evidence considered by the learned High Court Judge

covered the period subsequent to the termination of service of the Appellant, ie

14/0211998 . The learned High Court Judge in the said order held that the

Appellant cannot be responsible for any short fall of stocks causing loss to the 15t

Respondent subsequent to his termination of service. Soon after, the 2nd

Respondent referred the same matter back to an arbitrator to inquire into the

alleged loss caused by the appellant covenng the period, VIZ., 14/0211998 to

1910211998, which was already inquired into by the High Court and the Labour

Tribunal.

The term res judicata is of use to prevent frequent attempts to determine the

same point. Thus, if an applicant attempts to obtain a decision from one tribunal,

Page 6 of 9

fails, tries later on the same point, still fails, and then seeks appeal or review, res

judicata is an appropriate label to apply provided that the original decision was

intra vires. (Administrativ(! Law, 2nd Ed. by P.P. Craig, pg. 489)

It is noted that, if the Respondents were not satisfied with the said order

delivered by the learned High Court Judge, the proper course of action would have

been to canvass the said order in an appropriate forum, instead, the issue was

referred back to a fresh arbitration.

In the written submissions filed of record, the learned State Counsel

submits with approval that the subsequent arbitrator has no legal duty to consider

the previous judicial proceedings.

In Stassen Exports Lts. Vs. Lipton Ltd. and Another (supra), Dr. Shirani

Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) held that;

"A Carejid study of the doctrine of res judicata clearly indicates that, if the parties

are allowed to re-agitate a question, which has been settled before a higher Court

finally, again before a quasi judicial tribunal to make order affecting the rights of

parties, then the purpose of the doctrine of res judicata would become

meaningless and there would never be any finality in any dispute. Considering

such practrical difficulties, P. Narayanan (Law of Trade Marks and Passing off,

5'h Edition, 2000, pg. 709) had stated thai,

Page 7 of 9

"The words 'court' and 'suit' have been given a wide interpretation and the

application of the rule of res judicata has been extended 10 proceedings before

tribunals other than courts. "

Accordingly judicial precedent, which is part of the law of this country, is to be

applied not only to Courts, but also to other Tribunals and authorities, which have

the power 10 make orders affecting the rights of other parties. A decision of the 2nd

Respondent would be binding on parties only until a decision is taken by a Court

of law and the doctrine of res judicata, which enables to ensure that there would

be a finality in a final determination in a dispute before Court by prohibiting the

re-agitation of such disputes would become meaningless and having no force, if

the identical matter, which had earlier been considered by the District Court and

the Court of Appeal is to be reviewed once again by the Director-General of

Intellectual Property. "

Charge 6.1 (at page 185 of the brief) clearly stipulates the time period of the

offence as 01/0111998 to 19/02/1998, which covers the period subsequent to the

date of tennination of service of the Appellant. Having considered the available

evidence relevant to the said period, the Labour Tribunal and the High Court

which had jurisdiction over the said Issue made a judicial pronouncement by

which the question agitated reached finality.

. ,

I find that to re-agitate the merits of the same question decided by two

previous proceedings in the Labour Tribunal and the High Court acts as "a bar to

any claim or afoundation to an action" between the same parties.

Since the above findings would dispose of the substantive application

before Court, the necessity to make a judicial pronouncement on the second issue

would not arise.

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and grant relief as prayed for by the Appellant.

Appeal allowed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree.
