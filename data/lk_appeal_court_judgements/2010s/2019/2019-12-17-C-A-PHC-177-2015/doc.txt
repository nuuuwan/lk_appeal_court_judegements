Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This appeal was filed by the 2nd party respondent-petitioner-

appellant (hereinafter the appellant) against the Judgment of

the High Court dated 19.11.2015, which affirmed the order of

the Magistrates Court dated 10.10.2013.

The police filed the first information in the Magistrates Court of

Negombo under section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

No.44 of 1979, as amended.

The dispute relates to a roadway along the northern boundary of

the fisheries harbour ( ), depicted in the police

sketch tendered to the Magistrates Court with the first

information.1 The building marked B therein is the appellants

business premises. The dispute, to be more precise, is the

1 Vide page 34 of the brief.

appellant using the said stretch of the coast to go to his

business premises by vehicle. The 1st party respondents

(hereinafter the respondents) dispute the appellant doing so.

It is significant to note that, as the learned counsel for the

respondents stated at the argument, the respondents do not

object to the appellant using that roadway to go to his business

premises on foot. According to the respondents, there is only a

footpath and not a motorable road.

As seen from the affidavits tendered by several people in the

neighbourhood, this roadway is used not only by the appellant,

but by several fishing families.2

The position of the respondents is that allowing the appellant to

use such motorable roadway along the boundary of the fisheries

harbour to have access to his place of business, hinders the use

of this part of the coast as a fisheries harbour or boat yard.3

There is no dispute that both parties are in the fishing trade. If I

may say so, the respondents catch fish, whereas the appellant is

engaged in fish processing in his business premises, which

abuts the disputed road.

The appellant provides employment to several fishing families

through this business.4

The Divisional Secretary of the area, by 1P1, has stated that

although there is no documentary evidence to say there is a

2 Vide 2V3-2V6 tendered by the appellant with his affidavit. 3 Vide 1P6 at pages 87-90 of the brief. 4 Vide 2V11 at page 110 of the brief.

roadway across this fisheries harbour, upon local inspection it

was revealed that the residents of the area walk across the

fisheries harbour for their daily activities.5

The Divisional Secretary, by 2V9, has also stated that the fishing

community of the neighbourhood is greatly benefited by the said

fish processing factory run by the appellant, and, therefore, the

Divisional Secretary has no objection to allowing the appellant to

use a vehicle to transport his products along the disputed road,

without disturbing the activities of the fisheries harbour.6

The Director of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic

Resources, by 2V10, has also expressed the same.7

The Chairman of the Negombo Lagoon Management Authority

has issued a letter marked P9, strongly in support of the

appellant, stating that the said Authority has no objection to the

appellant using his vehicle to go to his factory along this road,

as other fishing families do.8

The learned Magistrate, in the impugned order, has come to the

conclusion that the subject land, or rather the part of the shore,

is a fisheries harbour, and the appellant shall not disturb the

respondents use of it as a fisheries harbour. The learned

Magistrate has further held that the appellant has failed to prove

that the subject land has been used as a road.9

There is no issue whether or not this is a fisheries harbour.

Everybody, including the appellant, accepts that it is so.

Similarly, there is no issue that the stretch of the coast along the

northern boundary, as per the police sketch, is used by the

fishing community at least as a footpath.

The real issue is whether the appellant can be permitted to use

that path to take his vehicle(s) to his factory, where he conducts

his fish processing business.

It is not clear by reading the impugned order, under which

section of the Primary Courts Procedure Actsection 68 or

69the learned Magistrate came to that conclusion; nor is it

clear on what basis the learned Magistrate disregarded the

aforementioned letters of the State officials, which are in favour

of the appellant. It appears to me that those letters were issued

on the basis that both parties are in the same trade and the

fishing community is also benefited by the said business of the

appellant.

There is no argument that a dispute relating to a right of way

falls within the ambit of section 69.

The learned Magistrate seems to have taken the view that the

appellant failed to produce evidence that he has been using this

stretch of the coast as a vehicular access road for some time.10

In my view, long use is not decisive in resolving this matter.

Let me first explain the legal position in this regard and then

apply it to the facts of this case.

When an application under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act is filed, a Magistrate can largely make two orders.

One is under section 68, which relates to possession of any

land; the other is under section 69, which relates to any right to

land other than the right to possession. The key word under

section 68 is possession, whereas the key word under section

69 is entitlement.

Section 69 reads as follows:

(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or

any part of a land, other than the right to possession of

such land or part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court

shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is

the subject of the dispute and make an order under

subsection (2).

(2) An order under this subsection may declare that any

person specified therein shall be entitled to any such right

in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as may

be specified in the order until such person is deprived of

such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent

court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference with the

exercise of such right by such party other than under the

authority of an order or decree as aforesaid.

This section corresponds to section 147 of the Indian Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973, which reads as follows:

Website Copy Website Copy

7

(1) Whenever an Executive Magistrate is satisfied from the

report of a police officer or upon other information, that a

dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists

regarding any alleged right of user of any land or water

within his local jurisdiction, whether such right be claimed

as an easement or otherwise, he shall make an order in

writing, stating the grounds of his being so satisfied and

requiring the parties concerned in such dispute to attend his

Court in person or by pleader on a specified date and time

and to put in written statements of their respective claims.

(2) The Magistrate shall then peruse the statements so put

in, hear the parties, receive all such evidence as may be

produced by them respectively, consider the effect of such

evidence, take such further evidence, if any, as he thinks

necessary and, if possible, decide whether such right

exists; and the provisions of section 145 shall, so far as

may be, apply in the case of such inquiry.

(3) If it appears to such Magistrate that such right exists, he

may make an order prohibiting any interference with the

exercise of such right including, in a proper case, an order

for the removal of any obstruction in the exercise of any

such right.

It may be seen that as much as there is a notable difference

between section 68 and 69 of our Primary Courts Procedure Act,

there is a remarkable difference between section 69 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act and section 147 of the Indian

Code of Criminal Procedure.

Under section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the party

who asserts such right shall establish that he is entitled to that

right.

Section 147 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure refers to

right of user of any land. It requires the Magistrate to decide

whether such right exists and then make an order prohibiting

any interference with the exercise of such right.

Whereas the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure looks for the

existence of a right, our Primary Courts Procedure Act looks for

the entitlement to a right. It appears that our section expects a

heavier proof than its Indian counterpart.

In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri LR 693 at 699,

Sharvananda J. (later C.J.), had this to say on the scope of

section 69 of our Act:

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to

any land other than right of possession of such land, the

question for decision, according to section 69(1), is who is

entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word

entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court

has to determine which of the parties has acquired that

right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that right.

In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the

Court to determine the question which party is entitled to

the disputed right preliminary to making an order under

section 69(2). (emphasis mine)

Website Copy Website Copy

9

This means, in order to succeed under section 69, in respect of a

right other than the right to possession, a party shall satisfy the

Court:

(a) that he acquired that right; or

(b) that he is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right.

There is a common misbelief that a high degree of proof of all the

necessary ingredients to establish such right is necessary even

under section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. It must

be emphasised that a party seeking relief under section 69 need

not establish entitlement to the right in the manner required

before a District Court. For the purpose of this section, it would

be sufficient for such party to satisfy the Magistrate that he is

entitled for the time being to exercise that right.

It must be made clear that whether under section 68 or 69, the

inquiry before the Magistrates Court cannot be converted to a

full-blown civil trial. The jurisdiction of the Magistrate cannot

exceed the objective of this special piece of legislation, which is

to make a provisional order, in terms of law, to prevent a breach

of the peace until the substantive rights of the parties are

established, as seen from section 73 of the Act, in a civil suit.

If the same is expected to be established before the Magistrates

Court in section 66 proceedings, there is no necessity to go

before the District Court for the second time. If that is what is

expected, it is meaningless to say in section 73 that the order of

the Magistrate shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in

Website Copy Website Copy

10

any land or part of a land which any person may be able to

establish in a civil suit.

In my view, the word entitled appearing in section 69 need not

be given undue weight or importance. It is interesting to note

that the word entitled appears in section 68 as well, although

we never give any importance to it. Section 68(1) expects the

Magistrate to make order as to who is entitled to possession of

such land or part thereof. Similar words are found in section

145 of the Indian Code, which corresponds to section 68 of our

Act. Referring to the term entitled to possession found in the

Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, Sarker on Criminal

Procedure Code, 6th edition (1992), at pages 323-324 states:

Entitled to possession obviously means to retain possession

until eviction by law. It does not of course mean that the

Magistrate is given power to decide title or right to possession.

The term entitled to the right found in section 69 shall be given

a liberal meaning and not an overly restrictive meaning.

For completeness I must state the following. Under section 68,

in relation to the right to possession, the party dispossessed, if

he is to be successful, shall come before the Magistrates Court

within two months from the date of dispossession. Under section

69, when it comes to any right other than the right to

possession, there is no such time stipulated in the Act.

In India, this has been provided for by the proviso to section

147(3) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, which runs as

follows:

Website Copy Website Copy

11

Provided that no such order shall be made where the right

is exercisable at all time of the year, unless such right has

been exercised within three months next before the receipt

under sub-section (1) of the report of a police officer or other

information leading to the institution of the inquiry, or

where the right is exercisable only at particular seasons or

on particular occasions, unless the right has been exercised

during the last of such seasons or on the last of such

occasions before such receipt.

According to the Indian Code, section 147 comes into play if the

right is exercised within three months of the filing of the action

in cases of rights exercisable at all times of the year or exercised

on the last particular occasion or season of periodically

recurring rights.

Then the question is whether a party who was disturbed or

denied such other right under section 69 of our Primary Courts

Procedure Act can come before the Magistrates Court at any

time. This shall be answered in the negative, given the intention

of the legislature in enacting this Act, which is solely to prevent

breach of the peace from land disputes of this nature. Such

party shall come before the Magistrates Court within reasonable

time. What constitutes reasonable time shall be decided on the

unique facts and circumstances of each individual case.

Let me now revert to the instant case.

Long use or long possession, which the learned Magistrate laid

emphasis on, is not the only basis for establishing a right of

way. There are other ways of establishing the appellants

Website Copy Website Copy

12

entitlement for the use of that right of way, at least, for the time

being.

In my view, in the facts and circumstances of this case,

especially in view of the letters issued by the State agencies

including the Divisional Secretary, the appellant has established

that he is entitled to use the disputed road, for the time being, to

take his vehicles to his business premises.

The next question is the scope of that right established by the

appellant. During the course of argument, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant drew the attention of the

Court to the photographs marked 2V12 and 2V13 and the

affidavit of the building material supplier marked 2V7, to argue

that two small lorries travelling in opposite directions can pass

by each other easily on this road.

However, the appellant in his statement to the police dated

10.04.2013 has spoken about taking his small lorry (commonly

known as Batta Lorry) and three-wheeler to his factory, and the

obstruction caused by the respondents.

Hence, I decide that the ends of justice will be met by allowing

the appellant to take his small lorry and the three-wheeler along

the disputed road.

The learned counsel for the respondents at the argument made a

passing observation that new laws have been enacted to protect

coastal areas and, therefore, the approvals/recommendations

given by the said State agencies need to be reviewed. In these

section 66 proceedings, which are provisional in nature, there is

Website Copy Website Copy

13

no necessity to go into minute detail of those new laws, which

the learned counsel did not particularly mention except by way

of a passing remark.

The respondents, if they are so desirous, can make

representations to the proper authorities in that regard and

request that they reconsider their standpoints.

This order will not be an impediment for the proper authorities

in charge of the coastal zone to take any decision on this

specialised subject in accordance with the law.

It may be noted that, in terms of section 69(1), the order made

by the Magistrate in favour of a party is valid until such person

is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or decree of a

competent court. In Podisingho v. Chandradasa [1978/79] 2 Sri

LR 93 at 96, Atukorala J. gave an extended meaning to the term

competent court to encompass Tribunal of competent

jurisdiction.

The Judgment of the High Court is without substance. The High

Court has merely dismissed the revision application on the

grounds that (a) the appellant has not established a servitude of

right of way and (b) no right has been accrued to the appellant

by the letters of the State agencies, as they have been issued in

their official capacity. I fail to understand how those letters lack

validity if they have been issued by the respective State officials

in their official capacity. There is no room for consideration of a

servitude of right of way. The servient tenement does not belong

to the respondents. The owner of the servient tenement, the

coast, belongs to the State. The State has no objection to the

Website Copy Website Copy

14

disputed road being used by the appellant as a means of ingress

to and egress from his workplace by his vehicles.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the order of the

Magistrates Court and the Judgment of the High Court, and

allow the appeal of the appellant without costs.

Until another directive is given by the proper authorities or until

a contrary order is made by a competent Court, the appellant

can use the disputed road to take his small lorry and the three-

wheeler to and from his fish processing factory.
