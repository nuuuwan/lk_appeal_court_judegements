Samayawardhena, J.

The 7th defendant-appellant has filed this appeal against the

Judgment of the District Court of Bandarawela dated

16.08.2000.

In the petition of appeal, the appellant has sought to exclude Lot

3 in the Preliminary Plan marked X at the trial.

The learned counsel for the appellant before this Court makes

submissions seeking exclusion of Lot 4 in Plan marked 7V1 at

the trial.

The Plan marked 7V1 is not the Preliminary Plan. Lot 4 of the

Plan marked 7V1 has not been superimposed on the Preliminary

Plan to identify the portion to be excluded.

More importantly, no issue has been raised by the appellant

regarding exclusion (or any other matter) at the trial

notwithstanding the appellant has been represented by a senior

counsel, who has expressly stated, according to the proceedings,

that no issue would be raised on behalf of the appellant. If such

an issue has not been raised at the trial, it is elementary that no

such position seeking exclusion of a part of the corpus can be

taken up for the first time in appeal.

This is the only point raised by the learned counsel for the

appellant during the course of argument.

This appeal is clearly devoid of merit. I dismiss the appeal with

costs.
