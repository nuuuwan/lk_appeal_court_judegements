M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent above named (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted this partition action (on 16.12.1981) bearing case

No. 16551/P to partition the land called Nanawalagawa Owitta Watta more

fully described in the schedule to the plaint in extent of 1A-1R-30P amongst

the Plaintiff - 4/7 shares, 1st to 3rd Defendants - 1/7 shares each of the corpus.

The Respondent in her Plaint set out the pedigree and stated that the land

was given to Namalgamuwage Lokuhamy by Namalgamuwage Brampi Singho

for the purpose of plantation and 4th to 8th Defendants are in possession of a

small portion of the land at the time of the institution of this case, however,

they have only entitled to said plantation share. It was the further position of

the Respondent that, the 9th Defendant without any rights over the corpus

was forcibly trying to construct a building in the land.

The case thereafter fixed for trial on 14 issues raised by parties and at the trial

on behalf of the Respondent, the husband of the Respondent, P. K.

Sumanadasa, the Licensed Surveyor who prepared the Preliminary Plan were

gave evidence and concluded the case of the Respondent. On behalf of the

Defendants, the 5th, 9th, and 11th Defendants were gave evidence and

concluded the case of the contesting Defendants.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge allocated shares in the

following manner:

Plaintiff : 4/7 shares

1st Defendant : 1/7 shares

3

2nd Defendant : 1/7 shares

3rd Defendant : 1/7 shares

The 5th, 9th and 11th Defendants are entitled to only 25 perches by way

of prescription.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment and the allotting shares, the present

appeal preferred by the 5th and 11th Defendant-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellants) on the following grounds:

1. The Respondent was not identified the land properly; and

2. The Appellants have prescribed the land.

In this appeal, contesting Appellants had taken a position that the land in

dispute is not correctly depicted in Preliminary Plan; it was their contention

that only a portion of the land is surveyed and shown in Preliminary Plan and

the land sought to be partitioned is larger than the land shown in the

Preliminary Plan. Therefore, in the District Court they have requested for a

fresh commission. It is to be noted that the above request was allowed by the

Court, even the Appellants failed to submit required documents for a fresh

commission (vide page 222 of the appeal brief).

The above said Licensed Surveyor in his evidence stated that there had been

no objections from the parties with regard to his survey of the land and he

gave evidence that the depicted in the commission has been properly

identified and surveyed.

The meats and bounds of the land to be partitioned have been correctly

defined by Plan X. The learned District Judge noted that the 3 boundaries of

the land had been correctly identified as reasonably required in a partition

4

action. The Surveyor in his evidence has refused the position taken up by the

Respondents that they objected to the extent of the land surveyed by him

(observation of the learned District Judge at page 2226 of the appeal brief).

The Appellants another submission was that, they have prescribed the land. In

contrast the Respondents position is that (in the District Court of Avissawella,

Case No. 8996) the Appellants have admitted the ownership of Brampi Singho

the predecessor in title of the Respondent and the 1st to 3rd Defendants.

Therefore, the Respondent further submitted that the Appellants were only

permissive possessors.

Thus the Counsel for the Respondent correctly submitted that to overcome

the permissive nature of their possession, the Appellants should adduce

cogent evidence before court and thereafter they should establish their

uninterrupted, peaceful, and continuous possession for more than 10 years.

But the Appellants failed to do so.

In DE SILVA VS. COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF INLAND REVENUE, [80 NLR

292], Sharvananda, J. clearly and deeply observed that:

The principle of law is well established that a person who bases

his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the

possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The

acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the

rights of the true owner; the person in possession must claim to

be so as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no

5

hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can be no

adverse possession In deciding whether the alleged acts of the

person constitute adverse possession, regard must be had to the

animus of the person doing those acts, and this must be

ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each case and

the relationship of the parties. Possession which may be

presumed to be adverse in the case of a stranger may not attract

such a presumption, in the case of persons standing in certain

social or legal relationships. The presumption represents the

most likely inference that may be drawn in the context of the

relationship of the parties. The Court will always attribute

possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where the

possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be assumed,

in the absence of evidence, that the possession is lawful. Thus,

where property belonging to the mother is held by the son, the

presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son was on behalf

of and with the permission of the mother. Such permissive

possession is not in denial of the title of the mother and is

consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the possession

to acquire title by adverse possession.

Where possession commenced with permission, it will be

presumed to so continue until and unless something adverse

occurred about it. The onus is on the licencee to show when and

how the possession became adverse. Continued appropriation of

the income and payment of taxes will not be sufficient to convert

permissive possession into adverse possession, unless such

conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the perimeters title. In

order to discharge such onus, there must be clear and affirmative

6

evidence of the change in the character of possession. The

evidence must point to the time of commencement of adverse

possession. Where the parties were not at arms length, strong

evidence of a positive character is necessary to establish the

change of character. (Pages 295 and 296)

In D.R. KIRIAMMA V. J.A. PODIBANDA AND 8 OTHERS Udalagama J. adverted

to some important points to be borne in mind in considering a claim of

prescriptive title:

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the

party claiming prescriptive possession. Importantly, prescription

is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum probandum.

I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is

necessary to recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it

deprives the ownership of the party having paper title. It is in fact

said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due to

the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri

Lanka prescriptive title is required to be by title adverse to an

independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff.

In this regard, the observation of the Hon. G. P. S. De Silva, C. J. in ALWIS VS.

PIYASENA FERNANDO [(1993) 1 SLR 119] is noteworthy:

"..It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial

Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly

disturbed on appeal.

7

In ARIYADASA VS. ATTORNEY GENERAL[ (2012) 1 SLR 84] the Court observed

as follows:

Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a Judge with

regard to the acceptance or rejection of a testimony of a witness,

unless it is manifestly wrong, when the trial Judge has taken such

a decision after observing the demeanor and the deportment of

a witness...

Therefore, in the light of the above backdrop, I see no reason to interfere with findings of the learned District Judge.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal with Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
