Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed against the Judgment of the learned District

Judge of Horana dated 02.11.2000.

Notices of Appeal have been filed only by the 12th defendant and

the 22nd defendant. Thereafter, in addition to the said 12th and

22nd defendants, Petitions of Appeal have been filed by the 23rd,

24th, 36th, 38th, 40th-47th defendants. Without first Notices of

Appeal being filed, 23rd, 24th, 36th, 38th, 40-47th defendants cannot

file Petitions of Appeal.

The 22nd defendant did not participate at the argument.

At the argument, counsel for the parties agreed to dispose of

argument by way of written submissions.

Some parties, who have neither filed Notice of Appeal nor Petition

of Appeal, have filed written submissions challenging the

Judgment. That is not possible.

The only outstanding appeal to be considered is the 12th

defendants appeal. In paragraph 5 of the Petition of Appeal, the

12th defendant-appellant has stated her grievance.

At the trial, the 12th defendant has raised 14-19 issues. All those

issues have been answered in the affirmative. However, the

learned Judge in the Judgment has given only 0.014286 share to

the 12th defendant. It is the position of the 12th defendant that she

should have been given 0.2 share in the manner the issues have

been answered. That position is acceptable.

The District Judge has accepted that Adonis Silva to be the original

owner of the land and he had 11 children and one of them died

issueless making the remaining 10 children to be entitled to 1/10

share to the land. The plaintiff, 1st-5th defendants are 6 of Adonis

Silvas children. The District Judge in the Judgment has given

each of the said 6 children, except the 4th defendant, 0.1 share.

The District Judge, in answering the plaintiffs issues in the

affirmative, accepts that Viyonis is a child of Adonis Silva. The

said Viyonis by Deed marked 12D1 (at page 217 of the Appeal

Brief) transferred his rights to the 12th defendant. Issue No.14 is

on that transfer and the learned Judge has answered that issue in

favour of the 12th defendant. As a child of Adonis Silva, Viyonis

also shall get 0.1 share and that share shall go to the 12th

defendant.

The 4th defendant, Yasonona, is also a child of Adonis Silva and

therefore she also, as the other children, is entitled to 0.1 share.

The 4th defendant, by Deed marked 12D4 (at page 229 of the

Appeal Brief), has transferred her share to the 12th defendant.

Accordingly, the 12th defendant shall get 0.2 share and not

0.014286 share given by the District Judge.

The 12th defendants appeal is allowed. Subject to the above

variation on the 12th defendants share, the Judgment of the

District Court is affirmed. No costs.
