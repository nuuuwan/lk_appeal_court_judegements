A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

Vikum de Abrew, DSG with Chaya Sri Nammuni, SC for the 1st Defendant~Appellant

Priyantha AbeyrJ.thne for the Plaintiff~ Respondent

19.07.2018

The Plaintiff~Respondents (hereinafter sometimes-referred to as "the Respondents")

filed an action in the District Court of Bodulla clahning, inter alia damages in a sum of

Rs.500,000/~ jOintly or severally from the pt Defendant--Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the App~llant"), the Hon. Attorney General and the 2nd Ddendant~

Respondent, Nimal Wijenanda, a driver of the Girandwllkotte Police Station, for the death

of the husband and father of the Plaintiff~ Respondent" allegedly caused by the negligent

driving of the 2nd Defend,.nt~Respondent.

The Hon. Attorney General was made a party on the basis 'of the alleged vicarious

I liability attached to the State since the vehicle driven by the 2nd Defendant~ Respondent

belonged to the Girandumlwtte Police Station.

Having filed the plaint, snmmons was served on the Appellant on 07.07.1995 and upon a

perusal of the summons it was returnable on 15.09.1995, which also was designated to be

a date for Answer. , . , .

It has been the inveterate of the Attorney General's pepartment from time immemorial

that an Attorney~at~Law of good repute form the private bar is chosen to function as the

Registered Attorney on behalf of the Attorney General in designated courts. Section 27 of

the Civil Procedure Code recognizes this practice.

At this stage I would delvt;:: into the chronology of events as quite compendiously briefed

to this Court by learned 6eputy Solicitor General. It is also manifest from the record.

Chronology of events

The Proxy along with a covering letter (marked PI and PI (a) respectively), had been

"L dispatched to the Registered Attorney to reach him on 12.09.1995 requesting him to

obtain a long date to file Answer.

One observes that the State Attorney had thereafter sent a letter to the State Attorney

inquiring as to the statt. of the case as there had nnt been any response. This letter

marked P2 inquired whether a proxy was filed and a date obtained to file answer.

One finds Mr. Perera replying to P2 on 09.10.1995 stat\ng that he had not been in Badulla

during the week of the 15th of September and that this had been notified in wTiting to the

District Judge of Badulla By this response P3, Mr. Perera further informed the State

Attorney that he had not received the proxy and covering letter (PI and PI( a and since

he had not filed the proxy nor had he been present in court, the matter had been fixed for

ex parte trial against the Hon. Attorney General. He went on to state in P3 that he had

already obtained the cOl1~ent of the Plaintiff-Responc/tents' counsel to have the ex parte

order set aside and he w(luld file the necessary papers 1 a fresh proxy was sent since the

former had been misplaced by him-vide page 86 of the Appeal Brief.

As requested, the relevant Assistant State Attorney had duly sent another coving letter

along with a fresh proxy on 19.10.1995 requesting the Registered Attorney to obtain a

long date for answer-see P.4page 88 of the Appeal Brief.

By a letter dated P5 Mr. Perera informed the Assistant State Attorney that the order for

the ex parte trial had been vacated and the case would sent be called 011 03.11.1995.

Thereafter another letter had been stating that Answer was due on 19.01.1996-see P6.

Thus this machinery tried and tested for years on end has been in existence in order to

ensure the appearance and defence of the Hon Attorney General in civil litigation and

this contractual relationsl-ijp with the State attorney designated in the circuit imposes on

him the duty to appear on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General and keep him posted of

the progress of the case every step of the way.

4

In this instance one next observes a letter sent by Mr. Perera (P7) dated 25.03.1996

wherein he states that he had sent the Attorney~General's Department several letters

dated 11.11.1995; 04.12.1995 (P6) and 18.01.1996 out ot which the State Attorney in the

Department had only received the letter dated 04.12.2005 marked P6. Mr. Perera states

in the letter dated 25.03.1996 that although by the aforementioned letters he had

informed the department that the next date for answer was 22.03.1996 and that he had

not received the answer and that he could not have fled answer himself since he did not

have even a copy of the plaint with him and that although he had tried to move' for time

to file answer on behalf of the 2nd Defendant the matt~r was fixed ex parte against the 2nd

Defendant on 17.03.1996 .. Thereafter, Mr. Perera had sent two consecutive letters dated

08.04.1996 and 22.04.199h requesting for the answer to be sent.

It is apparent upon a perusal of the record that the Att'Jrney General was not informed of

the next date for answer, namely the 22nd March 1996 and that he was the pt Defendant

and not the 2nd Defend,mt as mentioned in the lett(~r marked P7. The relevant State

Attorney in the Attorney--General's Department had sent three copies of the answer of

the pt Respondent to Nir. Perera by letter dated 30.,04.1996 and had, by letter dated

09.05.1996 inquired as to tne correct position, whether the trial had been fixed ex parte

against the 2nd Defenda~lt or the pt Defendant who was the Hon. Attorney General.

Thereafter it would appear that the position that the JIlatter was fixed ex parte against the

Hon. Attorney General. had been confirmed and it transpired that the Plaintiffs had

refused to consent to alll1w an the answer to be file~~ on behalf of the Hon. Attorney

General.

The case was taken up for trial on 08.07.1996 where the Counsel for the Plaintiffs had

made the application to 'conduct the ex parte trial a~~ainst the pt Defendant, the Hon.

Attorney General and dl1t he would conduct the case against the 2nd Defendant the

driver if necessary. With the adduction of evidence of two witnesses, the case for the

Plaintiff had been concluded.

5

On the very same date the learned district Judge made order that the accident had . . occurred due to the negligent driving of the 2nd Defendant and an ex parte judgment was

" entered against the lstDefendant~videpage 37 of the Appeal Brief.

Afterwards, once the ex parte decree was served on the 1st Defendant, the Hon. Attorney

;':;eneral made an application to vacate the ex parte judgment and at the purge~default

inquiry, the evidence of th~ Senior State Attorney regarding the correspondence between

the State and Mr. Perera had been led before the District Court. One also finds written

submissions filed on beh(i:lf of the Attorney~General~vide page 61 of the Appeal Brief. The

principal grounds for the vacation of the ex parte decree that had been urged before the

District Court are inter alia the following:~

1. the Hon. Attorney General had not been informed that the matter had been

fixed for answer on 22.03.1996 and therefore there was no opportunity to

prepare answer and transmit it to Mr. Perera so that it could have been filed on

that day;':

11. that, within the structural framework of the Attorney General's Department,

all measures were taken to attend to this case diligently;

iii. that the Han. Attorney General, should not be made to suffer for the

mistakes/inadvettence of his Registered Attorney (Mr. Perera).

The learned District Court Judge refused to vacate the ex parte judgment and adumbrated

the following at page 50 of the appeal brief:~

. ,

1. Mr. Perera had been negligent from the very commencement of the case as

evident from the correspondence marked by the 1st Defendant;

ii. that a mistake could have been excused but negligence cannot, and that as

there is negligence by the client as well, the Indian case cited would not apply;

Ill. that the Hon. Attorney General has numerous officers working for him so that

anyone of them could have been utilized to file answer;

6

IV. that the Attorney General's Department should be more proactive and eager in

a case than any other Department.

Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the above order, the Hon. Attorney General has

preferred this appeal.

, After preliminary written submissions, oral submi,ssions were made and written

submissions have since been filed by the parties setting out the cracks of the oral

submissions.

Section 86(2) of the CivjJ Procedure Code is quite clear that if reasonable grounds are

shown for the default, the Court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the

defendant to proceed with his defence as from the state of his default upon such terms as

to cost or otherwise as to;the Court shall appear proper.

The question before the learned District Judge at the purge~default inquiry was whether

the Attorney General had satisfied Court that there were reasonable grounds for the

default that had occurred in this case.

Moreover an inquiry intO' an application to set aside aD ex parte decree is not regulated by

any specific provision of the Civil Procedure Code. Such inquiries must be conducted

consistently with the p::-inciples of natural justice and the requirement of fairness.

Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code recognizes the inherent power of the court to

make an order as may be necessary for the ends of justice. De Fonseka v.

Dharmawardene (l994~l\ 3 Sri LR 49. Fairness and Reasonableness dictate the

overarching ambit of a purge~default inquiry and one has to bear in mind the useful

guidelines given in the C<ls:e of Rev Sumanatissa v. Barry 2009 (1) Sri LR 31 wherein

this Court held that what IS to be decided is whether ~he default in question was willful

or not. It was further heJd in this case that: "Negligence may in certain circumstances constitute , reasonable grounds within thc, meaning of Section 87(2) of the Code".

Thus this Court in CA l!04100 (F) (decided on 17.03.2017) explored the reasonableness

of an order to dismiss the plaint in an action where the registered Attorney~at:-'Law and

Counsel were both present in Court but the Plaintiff was absent from Court because he

7

was away in the United 3tates having met with an accident. This Plaintiff pad been

, . present in Court on previous occasions. This Court emphasized to look upon, 'previous

conduct of a party in attellding Courts before proceedmg to treat absence on a particular

day as willful default.

Willful default has to be decided taking into consideration the past conduct of the

parties and the circumst2nces which gave rise to the default and whether the Plaintiff

has concocted fraudulent' reasons to explain his absenLe~see similar strands of thought in

the case of Altha! v. Perera CA No.l5S7/200S dated 12.07.2007 which has been cited by

the learned Counsel from the State.

There was abundant evidence before the learned District Judge to conclude that there

was no willful default or the part of the Attorney General in proceeding to undertake a

defence in this case as the relevant State Attorney has diligently acted in communicating

with the recognized agentin this case. Merely becausf;': a Registered Attorney~at~Law of

the Attorney~General ha~,misplaced his communicatic)ns from the Attorney~General the

Attorney~General cannot be visited with the sanction of nonparticipation in the trial by

virtue of an ex parte trial being fixed against him when the course of correspondence

between the State Attorney in the office of the Attorney~General and its Registered

Attorney in the outstation courts quite clearly manifests due diligence on the part of the

, State Attorney. The learned District Judge has evidently held that the Registered

Attorney had been neglie;ent and in my view that wOl1ld constitute a reasonable ground

for the default on the part of the 1 st Defendant~ Appellant in not filing answer on the due

date and in the circumstances the learned District Judge ought to have vacated the

decree that had been ent~red after trial ex parte.

1 see a palpable error of law on the part of the learned District Judge to have refused to

set aside the judgment entered upon default and accordingly I set aside the judgment

dated refusing to vacate the ex parte judgment dated 23.09.1997 and in the process the ex

parte judgment dated OS.07. 1996 is also set aside.

8

I allow the appeal and remit this case to the District Court of Badulla with a direction to

the learned District Judge to permit the Attorney-General to file answer and thereafter to

hear and conclude the trh1.
