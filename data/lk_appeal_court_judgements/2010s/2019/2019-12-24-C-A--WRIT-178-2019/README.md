Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner had joined the Sri Lanka Army on 2nd May 2011. The Petitioner

states that having entered into an agreemen ~ with the Commander of the Sri

Lanka Army, the Petitioner had followed a course on X-ray Technology from

20th January 2014 - 21st January 2016. The Petitioner has not produced a copy

of the agreement that he signed, but has produced marked'Pl', a specimen of

an agreement that is usually executed when such training is provided. The

Petitioner states that in terms of the said agreement, he was required to serve

the Sri Lanka Army for a period of 10 years after the completion of the course

or else pay a sum of Rs.100,000/= if he was to resign from the Sri Lanka Army

prior to the completion of the said period.

The Petitioner has been absent without leave from the Sri Lanka Army since 7th

April 2016, and continues to remain so. He states that even though he made an

application to be discharged from the Sri Lanka Army at the time a general

amnesty was offered to all persons who had been absent without leave, the

Petitioner had not been considered for such an amnesty.

The Petitioner states further that he made a request that he be discharged

from the Sri Lanka Army upon the payment of the course fee, but that his

request was turned down by the Sri Lanka Army, by its letter dated 16th

October 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'pg', which reads as follows:

The Petitioner claims that although his application was refused, Sri Lanka Army

had allowed two other Corporals, namely Karunaratne ,nd De Alwis, who were

similarly circumstanced as him, to resign under the general amnesty. According

to 'pg', Corporal Karunaratne had been sacked from Sri Lanka Army upon a

directive by the Ministry of Defence. Corporal De Alwis had been sacked from

the Sri Lanka Army on the basis that his services are no longer required. 'pg'

goes on to state that "@eD ereDq)Otel @9 I;,cDelJ ~eDrn ~ @~ elJrnBl1:l) ~&1l

Aggrieved by the fact that his application for a discharge had been refused

while the applications of the above Corporals had been allowed, the Petitioner

has complained to the 3rd Respondent, the Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka (HRC).

The power of the HRC to investigate complaints received by it has been set out

in Section 14 of the Human Rights Commission Act No. 21 of 1996, and reads

as follows :

4

Website Copy Website Copy

"The Commission moy, on its ')wn motion or on a complaint made to it by

an aggrieved person ... , investigate an allegation of the infringement or

imminent infringement of a fundamental right of such person or group of

persons caused

(a) by executive or administrative action; or

(b) as a result of an act which constitutes an offence under the Prevention

of terrorism Act. No.48 of 1979, committed by any person."

I In terms of Section 15(1) of the HRC Act, "Where an investigation conducted by

the Commission under section 14 does not disclose the infringement or

imminent infringement of a fundamental right by executive or administrative

action or by any person referred to in paragraph (b) of section 14, the

Commission shall, record that fact, and shall accordingly inform the person

making the complaint within thirty days."

By letter dated 29th November 2018, annexed to the petition marked 'Pll', the

HRC had informed the Petitioner as follows:

"~ OI:El!ill<90'B c:o;,eool P.llOl:if;!) (:fO E)&D Clt@fD(g@0 ~ @t~ (:ftllO, (i)Q) E)&D

Dissatisfied by the said deci ~ ion in 'Pll', the Petitioner has filed this

application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

5

J' !

Website Copy Website Copy

1) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in 'PH';

2) A Writ of Mandamus directing the HRC to conduct an inquiry into the

Petitioner's complaint.

The Petitioner admits that he has been absent without leave since April 2016.

Having joined the Sri Lanka Army, and having entered into an agreement to

undergo specialised training and thereafter serve Sri Lanka Ar-my for a period

of ten years, the Petitioner is now attempting to unilaterally withdraw from

the said agreement. The fact that the Sri Lanka Army has sacked two other

Corporals, whether similarly placed or otherwise, is irrelevant and does not

mean that the Sri Lanka Army must also allow the Petitioner to leave the Sri

Lanka Army. As pointed out in 'pg', having spent large sums of money on

training the Petitioner, it is important that the services of such trainees are

available to the Sri Lanka Army. In this background, this Court does not see any

illegality or unreasonableness in the decision of the HRC in 'PH' that the

complaint of the Petitioner does' not disclose an infringement of the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner.

In any event, this Court is of the view that the conduct of the Petitioner in

absenting himself from the Sri Lanka Army since April 2016 disentitles the

Petitioner to a discretionary remedy such as Writs of Certiorari or Mandamus.

This position was upheld in Selvamani vs Dr. Kumaravelupillai and Others

l

where this Court held as follows:

1 (2005) l 5LR 99; per Sisira de Abrew J.

"A person who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of

certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right

or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a

discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches,

waiver submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments, which stand

against the grant of relief."

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.
