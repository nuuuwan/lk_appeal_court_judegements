01. Accused Respondent (Respondent) was indicted in the High Court of Kandy

for one count of kidnapping punishable in terms of section 354 of the Penal

Code and one count of grave sexual abuse punishable in terms of section

365(B)2(b) of the Penal Code. Upon serving the indictment, Respondent

pleaded not guilty to the charges and the learned High Court Judge fixed the

case for trial. On 15.10.2015 counsel for the Respondent moved to re-fix the

case for trial on personal grounds. Witnesses were warned to appear on the

next date and the trial was re-fixed for 17. 12 2015.

02. On 17.12. 2015 the Respondent moved to withdraw his early guilty plea and

to plead guilty. Upon reading the charges and Respondent pleading guilty,

2

learned High Court Judge proceeded to sentence the Respondent after

hearing the counsel for the State and the Respondent in mitigation. For both

counts 1 and 2, the learned High Court Judge sentenced the Respondent for

1 year rigorous imprisonment suspended for 15 years and fine of Rs.

10,0001- on each count and in default 1 year rigorous imprisonment.

FUl1her the Respondent was ordered to pay Rs. 250,0001- as compensation

to the victim child and in default 4 years rigorous imprisonment. Being

aggrieved by the above sentence, the Petitioner preferred this application to

get the sentence revised and substituted with an adequate sentence

according to law.

03. Notices were sent to the Respondent by this court on several occasions by

registered post and also served through process server of the District Court.

However, Respondent failed to appear and therefore the case was fixed for

argument. I have carefully considered the proceedings in the High Court,

application and the submissions made by the counsel for the Petitioner and

the relevant legal provisions.

04. Prescribed sentence for the offence of kidnapping (Count No.1) in terms of

Section 354 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of either

description which may extent to seven years and also be liable to a fine.

05. Prescribed sentence for the offence of grave sexual abuse (Count No.2) in

terms of section 365 B(2)b of the Penal Code is a term of rigorous

imprisonment of not less than seven years and not exceeding 20 years and

with a fine and also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount

determined by coul1 to the victim for the injuries caused to that person.

Injuries to the victim includes psychological or mental trauma.

06. Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that when the legislature has clearly

prescribed the minimum mandatory term of imprisonment of 7 years for the

offence in count No.2, the learned High Court Judge has given a term of

imprisonment for 1 year suspended for 15 years which is illegal and grossly

inadequate in the circumstances.

07. Learned High COUli Judge in his sentencing remarks has not given any

reason to deviate from the sentence prescribed by law, other than to say that

the Respondent is being remorseful and that he is not a registered criminal.

Learned High Court Judge has further said that he is also giving

consideration to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in case No. 17/2013.

08. Facts and circumstances of this case are totally different to that of case

No.SC Appeal 17/2013. In that case the victim of rape has delivered a baby

as a consequence of sexual intercourse between the victim and the Accused.

Accused had been looking after the child and supporting the mother (victim)

right through out. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court were of the view in

that case in the circumstances, in the best interest of the child, the Appellant

should not be incarcerated as the Appellant was supporting the victim and

the child genuinely. The facts and circumstances in SC Appeal 17/2013

have no application to this case other than to say that the court has the right

to use its discretion. That discretion has to be used judicially.

09. It is the duty of the court to give effect to the law enacted by the legislature.

To deviate from the prescribed minimum mandatory sentence, there has to

be compelling reasons. Reasons have to be so compelling unless otherwise

the couli would not be acting in the best interest of Justice.

10. The only mitigatory circumstances submitted and available for the

Respondent were that he was a first offender and that he tendered an early

guilty plea. Those mitigating factors would make the Respondent entitle to a

sufficient discount in his sentence, but would not be a compelling reason to

deviate from the prescribed minimum mandatory sentence of imprisonment.

11. The aggravating factors override the mitigating factors in this case. The

victim child had been 4 years old. The Respondent is her granduncle who

was 46 years old at the time the sexual offence was committed on the victim

child. Being her granduncle (mother'S sister's husbands' father), what is

expected of him is to protect the grandchild, not to sexually abuse her.

Respondent has therefore breached the trust reposed on him which is a

serious aggravating factor. Hence, I am of the firm view that the sentence

imposed on the Respondent by the learned High Court Judge is illegal,

wrong in principle and grossly inadequate. Therefore, we set aside the

sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge and taking into account

the sentence prescribed by law, the aggravating and mitigating factors, the

following sentence is substituted.

Count No.1. Rigorous imprisonment for 1 year

fine of Rs. 10,0001-, in default of payment 3 months

simple imprisonment.

Count No.2. Rigorous imprisonment for 8 years

fine of Rs. J 0,0001-, in default of payment 3 months

simple imprisonment.

5

Rs.250,OOOI- to be paid to the victim as compensation,

in default of payment simple imprisonment for 2

years.

Revision application allowed.
