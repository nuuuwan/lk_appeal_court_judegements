Decided on: 23.09.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application for restitutio in integrum

under Article 138 of the Constitution in 2002 seeking to set aside

the Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree entered in the

Partition Case No. 2163/P of the District Court of Panadura and

to make the Petitioner a party to the case and allow him to file

his Statement of Claim and to procced with the trial thereafter.

Upon the application being supported ex parte for Notice and

Stay Order, a previous Bench of this Court has allowed both,

and the Stay Order is in operation to date.

This application cannot be maintained on two grounds.

Firstly, it is settled law that an application for restitutio in

integrum can only be filed by a party to a case1, and a Partition

Case is not an exception.2

It was held in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v.

Shanmugam3 that:

1 For example: Perera v. Wijewickreme (1912) 15 NLR 411, Menchinahamy v. Muniweera (1950) 52 NLR 409, Fathima v. Mohideen [1998] 3 Sri LR 294 at 300, Velun Singho v. Suppiah [2007] 1 Sri LR 370 2 Dissanayake v. Elisinahamy [1978/79] 2 Sri LR 118, Ranasinghe v. Gunasekera [2006] 2 Sri LR 393 3 [1995] 1 Sri LR 55 at 59

The power of restitution differs from revisionary power of

this court in that the latter is exercised where the legality or

propriety of any order or proceedings of a lower court is

questioned. Restitution reinstates a party to his original

legal condition which he has been deprived of by the

operation of law. Thus it follows, the remedy can be availed

of only by one who is actually a party to the legal

proceeding in respect of which restitution is desired.

It is clear from the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner himself which

I quoted above that he was not a party to the case.

According to section 69(1) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, as

amended, the District Court can add parties only until the

Judgment is delivered.4

However, in terms of section 48(3) of the Partition Law, the

Court of Appeal can add parties even after the Interlocutory or

Final Decree being entered by way of revision to avert

miscarriage of justice when it is found that proceedings were

tainted by fundamental vice.5

Addition of a new party cannot be done by way of an application

for restitutio in integrum. It has to be upon an application for

revision. This is an application for restitutio in integrum and not

revision.

Secondly, according to section 66 of the Partition Law, any

voluntary alienation of the land to be partitioned after the lis

pendens is duly registered is void.

4 Gnanapandithen v. Balanayagam [1998] 1 Sri LR 391 at 394 5 Somawathie v. Madawala [1983] 2 Sri LR 15

4

However, it is not obnoxious to section 66, if parties transfer the

interests which they would acquire upon the conclusion of the

Partition Case.6

But those persons who acquire such rights pending partition after

lis pendens is registered need not be made parties to the case.7

The Petitioner in this case has not purchased interests from the

parties to the case, which they would acquire upon the conclusion

of the Partition Case.

Assuming he has, the lis pendens in this Partition Case has been

registered on 29.03.20078, and the Petitioner has acquired rights

by Deed No. 216 executed on 08.04.2007 and registered on

17.04.20079. That means, the Petitioner has acquired rights by

way of a Deed after the registration of the lis pendens, which is not

valid in the eyes of the Partition Law.

Petitioners application is clearly misconceived in law. I dismiss the

application with costs.
