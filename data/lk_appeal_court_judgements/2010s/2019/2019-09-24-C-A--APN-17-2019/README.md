K. PRlY ANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. The Accused-Petitioner-Petitioner (Petitioner) was charged In the

Magistrate's Court of Kuliyapitiya in case No. 32513 for committing an

offence punishable under section 78 (5) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

02. On 12.06.2017 Petitioner tendered an unconditional plea of guilty that was

recorded and moved for time to make sentencing submissions. On

31.07.2017, Petitioner moved further time to make submissions and on

04.09.2017 Petitioner filed an affidavit moving to withdraw his previous

unconditional plea of guilty. On 15.02.2018 learned Magistrate has

delivered the order refusing the application of the Petitioner to withdraw his

earlier plea of guilty.

03. Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, Petitioner

preferred an application to the High Court of Kuliyapitiya to get the order of

the learned Magistrate revised. The learned High Court Judge, for given

reasons refused the revision application on 08.01.2019 without issuing

notice to the Respondents. Being aggrieved by the said order of the leamed

High Court Judge, the instant application was filed by the Petitioner to get

both orders of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

revised.

3

04. I have carefully considered the application by the Petitioner, objections filed

by the Respondents and submissions made by counsel for both Petitioner

and the Respondents.

05. Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the learned Magistrate erred in law

by not allowing the Petitioner to withdraw his earlier plea for the reasons set

out in the affidavit.

06. Proviso to Section 183( I) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act provides

for withdrawing of a plea in the Magistrates' Court. Section reads;

"If the accused upon being asked if he has any cause to show

why he should not be convicted makes a statement which amounts to

an unqualified admission that he is guilty of the offence of which he is

accused, his statement shall be recorded as nearly as possible in the

words used by him; and the Magistrate shall record a verdict of guilty

and pass sentence upon him according to law and shall record such

sentence:

Provided that the accused may with the leave of the Magistrate

withdraw his plea of gUilt at any time before sentence is passed upon

him, and in that event the Magistrate shall proceed to trial as if a

conviction has not been entered. ..

4

07. Proviso to section 183 (1) makes it clear that the withdrawal of the plea has

to be with the leave of the Magistrate. It is the discretion of the Magistrate

whether to grant leave or not. As to how a Judge should use his discretion

was discussed in case of Fathima RillSa and another V. Attorney gel/eral

CA(PHC) 48/2009, 30.03.2019. In that case Court referred to case of

WijelVardene V. Lenora 60 NLR 457 at 463 where Court said;

"The mode of approach of al/ appellate Court to an appeal

against an exercise of discretion is regulated by well established

principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellale

Court consider thai, if they had been in the position of the trial Judge,

Ihey would have taken a differenl course. II musl appear Ihal some

error has been made in exercising the discretion. It must appear that

the Judge has acted illegally, arbitrarily or upon a wrong principle of

law or allowed extraneous or irrelevant considerations to guide or

affect him, or that has mistaken the facts, or not taken into account

some material consideration. Then only can his determination be

reviewed by the appellate Court. "

08. Tn the instant case, admittedly, the plea of guilty by the Petitioner had been

unequivocal. Nowhere the Petitioner says that he was misled or that he could

not understand the charge. The reason adduced in the application for

withdrawal of his guilty plea is that later he found that the sentence imposed

would affect his employment. The learned Magistrate has not acted illegally

or arbitrarily. He has not acted upon a wrong principle of law. Hence, the

learned High Court Judge had no reason to interfere with the order of the

learned Magistrate.

5

09. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned Magistrate has failed to

comply with section 182 (I) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. In that,

counsel submitted that the learned Magistrate has failed to sign the charge

sheet.

10. A similar situation was discussed in case of Imiyagamage GUllawatftie V

Aftomey general CA (PHC) 1391200909.10.2018.

In that case Court found that although the learned Magistrate has not put his

signature on the charge sheet, he had signed the journal entry, which showed

that the learned Magistrate has framed the charge.

11 . The main requirement and the purpose of a charge is that the Accused must

understand what he is charged for. In the instant case there is a charge sheet

filed of record. The Petitioner has produced a certified copy of the same.

Certi fied copy of the journal entry dated 12.06.2017 filed by the Petitioner

clearly indicates that the learned Magistrate has read and explained the

charge to the Petitioner. Petitioner has pleaded guilty and the learned

Magistrate has signed the journal entry. This position is not challenged by

the Petitioner. Petitioner admits that he was charged and that he pleaded

guilty to the charge unconditionally (paragraphs 2 and 3 of the petition).

Therefore, it is admittedly clear that the learned Magistrate has acted in

terms of section 182 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The learned

Magistrate merely not putting his signature underneath the charge sheet does

not mean that he has violated section 182(1). In this case it has not caused

any prejudice to the Petitioner.

6

In the above premise, I find no reason to interfere with the order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 08.01.2019, and the order of the learned

Magistrate dated 15.02.2018.

Application is dismissed.
