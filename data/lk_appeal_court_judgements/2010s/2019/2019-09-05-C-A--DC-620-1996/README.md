06.08.2019

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

on 19th September, 1973 to partition a land called

Kolongahamulawatta situated in Dambedeniya and morefully described in the plaint

containing about 3 lahas kurakkan sowing extent which is depicted as Lots 1, 2 and 3 in Plan

No.1713 dated 20.05.1974 prepared by K. Sivagnanasunderam, Licensed Surveyor,

containing in extent 3 Roods and 36 Perches. The said Plan is marked as 'x' and it's

Report as 'Xl'. Originally, the plaint was filed against the 1st and 2nd Defendants only and

the 3'd Defendant had been added subsequently.

In paragraph 11 of the plaint, the Plaintiff has given the shares as follows:-

The Plaintiff is entitled to an undivided J,4 share;

The 1st Defendant is entitled to an undivided 1;2 share, and

2nd Defendant is entitled to an undivided J,4 share.

Identity of the Corpus

In a partition action the identity of the land is very important because unless the identity

of the corpus is established, the title of the parties cannot be ascertained. The Court

cannot give judgment in respect of a land which is not part of the corpus. The Defendants

based their title on several deeds (VI to VlO) which refer to a different land in the village

except Deed NoVI0. The Defendant had also submitted a Plan bearing No.254 dated

3

20.06.1972 and 28.09.1972 (about one year prior to the institution of this action by the

Plaintiff) made by one R.A. Gunasoma Ratnayake, Licensed Surveyor. This Plan was not

one prepared on a Commission issued by the Court. However, the Surveyor K.

Sivagnanasunderam has made use of this Plan No.254 for identification of the corpus.

Surveyor K. Sivagnanasunderam, states in his report as follows: -

"I have superimposed Plan No.254 made by Mr. R.A. Gunasoma Ratnayake, Licensed

Surveyor, on a true copy of Plan No.1713 prepared by me. The disagreement of the

boundaries are shown in red. There is a slight disagreement along the northern boundary.

Superimposition discloses that Lots 1 &; 2 in Preliminary Plan No.1713 are identical to Lots

I, 2 &; 3 in Plan 254. Lot 3 in Plan No.1713 falls outside and is not covered by the corpus

depicted in Plan No.254". From this statement, it is clear that the boundaries and extent of

the land claimed by the Defendants are different from that of the land described in the

Plaint.

As it is, there are discrepancies between the two plans. When the Defendants claim a right

to a different land, it is imperative that they should move for a Commission from Court to

identify the land claimed by them, which they had failed to do so in this case. When the

Surveyor says that Lot 3 in Plan No.l713 falls outside the land depicted in Plan No.254, the

Court must find out where this Lot 3 is located in relation to the land depicted in Plan 254.

This is important from the standpoint of the court investigating the title of the parties. On

02.05.1990 when the trial commenced, the parties admitted that the land depicted as Lots

I, 2 and 3 in Plan No.1713 as the corpus. If that be so, the land depicted in Plan No.254 is

not the corpus. According to Surveyor Sivagnanasunderam, the Defendants' land depicted

in Plan No.254 is smaller than the land that is described in the plaint and depicted in his

Plan No.1713.

Hence, it is clear that the judgment entered in this case, diSmissing the Plaintiff's action

had been entered without identifying the real corpus which is sought to be partitioned

and proper investigation of the title of the Defendants to the land claimed by them.

Title of the Parties

In a partition action it is the bounden duty of the Court to investigate the title of the

parties. According to the Plaintiff's evidence, the Plaintiff's father Wawanna Mohammadu

Ismail became entitled to a J,4 share of the land called Kolonganawatta by Deed No.l426

dated 20.07.1939 marked (P3) and thereafter his father had donated the said J,4 share of the

land in extent 3 lahas kurakkall to the Plaintiff by Deed No.14570 dated 25.04.1968, marked

(P4). In his evidence in chief the Plaintiff had traced his pedigree, according to which his

father and his predecessors in title had been in possession of the undivided J,4 share,

another J,4 share to the 1" Defendant and an unclivided Y2 share to the 2nd Defendant. He has

also claimed plantations on the land.

It would appear that the Plaintiff and the 1" and 2nd Defendants belong to different

communities and therefore one cannot expect the Plaintiff to know the relationship of the

Defendants' predecessors in title or the Defendants cannot be expected to possibly know

the Plaintiff's predecessors in title. In the circumstances when the Plaintiff says in his

answer that he did not know the relationship of his predecessors, the Court cannot take

treat that answer as adverse answers to the Plaintiff's title. Since his father had bought this

land, the Plaintiff may not know these persons.

The Plaintiff said in his evidence under cross-examination that one Podisingho was in

possession of the land but he did not know how long he was in possession. This evidence

was given on 22.Ol.1991-that is after 18 years after the date of institution of the plaint. He

says further that Podisingho gave coconuts or money to his father. This shows that after

the Plaintiff's father had become the owner of 1/4th share, Poclisingho treated him as his

landlord and paid him money or coconuts as rent. This evidence was not contraclicted.

It must be noted that the Plaintiff father Wawanna Moharnedu Ismail, who became

entitled to an undivided J,4 share of the corpus in 1939, had been in possession of that land

and had been in receipt of produce and income from the said land.

Later, when Poclisingho threatened the Plaintiff not to enter the land, the Plaintiff made a

complaint to the "Sama Mandalaya". This was in 1968. Thereafter within a short period of

5

five years, in 1973, the Plaintiff instituted this action against the 1st and 2nd Defendants for

partition. The Plaintiff says in his evidence that he lives in the same area where the land is

situated.

Prescriptive possesslOn of the land need not be by the current owner only. His

predecessor's possession is also added to the possession of the present owner. In this

respect, even if the Plaintiff was not in possession of the said land, yet, his predecessors'

possession must be added. In Umma v. Ismail Lebbd Clarence, J. held that, "In a possessory

action the plaintiff might take advantage of the possession of his predecessor in title, and that it is

unnecessary that he himself should have had a year and a day's possession where that is one of the

requirements for bringing a possessory action". This decision was approved by Bonser C.J. in the

District Court of Negombo Case No.2795 (1898) S.c. Minutes 30.8.1898, and by Wendt, J. in

Goonewardene v. Pereira, (1902) 5 N.L.R. 320.

The above view of Clarence, J. in Umma v. Ismail Lebbe (supra) was followed in the case of

Silva v. Saranelis Appuhamy,2 by a Court consisting of Lascelles c.J. and Wood Renton,

J. and it was held that, "in a possessory action a Plaintiff might take advantage of the

possession of his predecessor in title and that it is unnecessary that he should himself have

had a year and a day's possession". In this case Lascelles C.]. had not followed the later

view that 'for a possessory action proof of possession for a year and a day is not necessary'.

On the contrary he expressed the view that: "The rule that possession for a year and a day

is necessary has been repeatedly acknowledged by the decisions of this Court, and it is at

any rate unlikely that it was intended in Silva v. Dingiri Menika (1910) 13 N.L.R. 179 to

over-rule all these decisions.

I am therefore, of the view that the Plaintiff has not only paper title to the 14 share claimed

by his but also prescription possession through his predecessors. Hence, the assumption of

the learned District Judge that the Plaintiff was not in possession of the corpus to entitle

him to rights in the corpus is wrong and is not tenable in law.

When considering the claim of the Defendants, most of the witnesses who had given

evidence on theit behalf, were speaking from knowledge commencing after the action was

instituted, or just about a few years before the date of the plaint. It must be noted that the

possession of the parties after the action is instituted cannot be taken into consideration

as if they have had long possession. The uninterrupted possession must over ten years

prior to the institution of the action. The Plaintiff says that he became entitled to 14th

share in 1968 and in the same year he had made a complaint to the "Sarna Mandalaya".

This partition action was filed in September, 1973, trial commenced in 1990 and the

judgment was pronounced in 1996. Taking these dates into consideration, the Defendants'

possession after institution of this action in 1973 does not inure to the benefit of the

Defendants as it is not the uninterrupted possession alluded to in Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

The witnesses for the Defendant had given evidence with short memories, i.e., almost closer

to the date of the plaint, and having regard to the possession of the Defendants, that

possession of the land cannot be accepted to give rise to prescriptive possession in favour

of the Defendants.

It must be noted that except the Deed marked as VlO, all the other deeds denote different

boundaries which refer to a different land. The Deeds VI to V9 cannot be accepted as

deeds relevant to the corpus in this action. Even if the Defendants had been in possession

of a land, as they claimed, that land is not the corpus. Theit land is not properly identified.

As stated by Surveyor Sivagnanasunderam, Lot 3 in his Plan falls outside the land depicted

in Plan No.254. The recent Deed No.l7323 dated 14.05.1973 (VIO) is an amicable partition

deed entered into between Podisingo (Ist party), Podi Appuhamy (2nd Party) and

Perisingho and Podimahatmaya (3rd party) in respect of an extent 3 Roods as depicted in

Plan No.254. The Plaintiff's counsel alleged this Deed No.YlO was executed after search in

the Land Registry. This might have been executed after the complaint of the Plaintiff

against Podisingho. After executing the amicable partition Deed No.l7323 the Defendants

are attempting to show that Plan 0.254 relates to the corpus in this action.

7

The learned Judge's contention that since the deeds are about 100 years old, the boundaries

may differ cannot be accepted. The purpose of a preliminary survey is to identify the land

even if the boundaries are now different. The Plan No.l713 is to be accepted as correct.

Accordingly, the Defendants have failed to identify their land and thereby failed to

establish their prescriptive possession to the corpus in this case. Furthermore, the

Defendants miserably failed to state clearly as to when their possession commenced. This

is important to count the prescriptive period, leaving aside the period after the

commencement of action. Only the period before the institution of the action shall be

counted.

Considering all the matters set out above, I am of the VIew that the Plaintiff has

established paper tide as well as prescriptive possession to \4 share of the corpus. The

Defendants have failed to prove that they are entitled to the corpus by prescriptive

possession. Accordingly, I set aside the judgment entered in this case and remit the case

back to the District Court to enter fresh judgment as prayed for in the plaint and to

proceed with further steps in the action
