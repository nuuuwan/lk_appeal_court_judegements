12/2003. The petitioner further seeks the case to be sent for a fresh trial before a

different High Court Judge.

Facts of the case:

The accused-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused') was indicted in

the High Court of Gampaha under section 296 of the Penal Code, for committing

Murder of his wife, Shiromi Renuka De Silva, between l3.12.1995 and

19.01.1996. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge acquitted

the accused, by the judgment dated 29.11.2006.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the petitioner preferred this application for

reVISIOn.

The incident relevant to the case is as follows;

The petitioner is the father of the deceased in the instant case. The accused was

married to the daughter of the petitioner on a marriage proposal.

As per the evidence of the petitioner (PW 01), the deceased and the accused got

married in May, 1995. After about a month ofthe marriage of the accused and the

deceased, the petitioner and his wife had visited the couple at the accused's house.

On that occasion, the deceased had shown the petitioner few photographs of the

accused lying with another woman in a compromising position. The petitioner had

tried to keep those pictures with him, but failed to do so since the accused

threatened that he would suicide if the pictures were not given to him. However,

the petitioner had kept three negative copies of the pictures which were later

produced in the Magistrate's Court. The petitioner had informed about this incident

to the parents of the accused, and subsequently, the accused had apologized to the

petitioner and the wife of the petitioner (mother of the deceased).

The petitioner further testified that on l3.12.1995, the accused had brought and

given the deceased a packet of murukku which the petitioner had seen deceased

consuming and only the deceased had consumed said murukku. Subsequently, the

Page 3 of 17

deceased was taken to a doctor, Dr. H.B. Perera, since she had started to feel a

stomach pain and vomited. The said doctor had advised them to admit the deceased

to a hospital to do further examination. Accordingly, she was admitted to a co-

operative hospital where she was examined by Dr. Heen Nilame (PW 13) and the

deceased remained in hospital for 3 days. The deceased returned home from the

hospital on 15.12.1995 (P 16 - Page 59 to 61).

The deceased had again fallen ill and admitted to the hospital for the second time

on 20.12.1995 (after 05 days from returning home). On that occasion, she had left

for office and petitioner was informed later at 9.30am that the deceased was

admitted to Gampaha Hospital. The deceased was unconscious and was transferred

to General Hospital, where she was in hospital for about 18 days till 08.01.1996.

Again on 14.0 l.l996, she was hospitalized for the third time on which occasion

she passed away. On this day, the deceased and the accused were in the house of

the petitioner. Additionally, a son of the petitioner's younger brother, wife of the

petitioner's younger brother and a house maid named Nalani were also at home.

The said son of the petitioner's younger brother is Mewan Sampath who testified

in the Magistrate's Court. Evidence of Mewan sampath was led in terms of section

33 of the Evidence Ordinance at the High Court trial since he was not available at

that time. As per evidence of Mewan Sampath, on the fateful day, prior to taking

breakfast at around 8.10 am, he had gone to the room of the deceased to take a

water jug. Mewan Sampath witnessed the accused giving some medicine to the

deceased and the accused tried to hide that medicine in his hands as Mewan

entered the room. Thereafter, Mewan had seen the deceased swallowing few

tablets. Subsequently, the deceased had fallen ill about 30 minutes after taking

medicine and 10 minutes after having breakfast. On the same day (14.01.1996), the

deceased was admitted to Gampaha hospital and she passed away on 19.01.1996.

Page 4 of 17

One W. Violet Wamakulasuriya (PW 22) who was the wife of the petitioner's

younger brother, testified at the trial. PW 22 had gone to the mortuary in the

Hospital Colombo with another relative, after the deceased passed away and they

had inquired about a necklace of the deceased. The accused had stated that the said

necklace was taken back since it was given to the deceased by his mother.

Thereafter, the accused had threatened to kill the petitioner and his wife if he had

been remanded for even one day in connection with the death of the deceased (P 13

-Page 13).

The prosecution led evidence of the house maid named Nalani. The said Nalani

testified that once the accused asked her to make a cup of tea for the deceased in

order to mix some medicine to be given to the deceased. Nalani had questioned the

accused as to why the medicine needed to be mixed in tea and not taken with

water. The accused had threatened her since she refused to make a cup of tea (P 14

- Page 236 & 237). It was further revealed that the accused promised to give a lot

of land to Nalani if she made a cup of tea. She had written a letter to her husband

informing the same, in her own handwriting.

As per evidence of Dr. L.B.L. De Alwis (PW 15), the death of the deceased was

due to Barbiturate poisoning. Dr. Alwis was the Judicial Medical Officer, Colombo

who issued the post mortem report dated 16.05.1997. In the said report, Dr. Alwis

has specifically mentioned that stomach contents, blood, liver, kidneys, bile and

hair of the deceased were sent to the Government Analyst for toxicological

analysis and the said analysis had revealed that Barbiturate had been identified in

all the specimens except for the hair which was not analyzed. Dr. Alwis testified

that based on the analysis of the Government Analyst's report, the clinical findings

and the post mortem examinations, he was 100% certain that the death of the

deceased was caused by Barbiturate poisoning (P 05 - Page 383).

Page 5 of 17

As per the evidence of Dr. Heen Nilame (PW 13), the only way a barbiturate can

enter a human body is through human intervention (P 11- Pag~ 223). According to

him, the barbiturate is a colorless, odorless and tasteless substance which can

easily be dissolved in water. Under cross-examination, Dr. Heen nilame was

questioned as to whether birth control pills contained Barbiturate, to which the

Doctor had answered in negative (P 11 - page 241). Upon perusal of the evidence

of the expert witnesses i.e. Dr. Alwis, Assistant Government Analyst and Dr. Heen

Nilame, it is understood that a little amount of barbiturate can put a person to sleep

for couple of days, about 600mg of barbiturate can cause unconsciousness and

1800mg of barbiturate can cause death.

It is imperative to note that Dr. Alwis had testified that as per blood reports

obtained from the deceased when she was last admitted to Gampaha Hospital, it

was revealed that there was Barbiturate in her blood. It was observed that even

after 4 days of treatments, there were still barbiturates in her organs.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner contended that the outset that

the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is totally irrational, unreasonable

and explains away the various items of evidence adduced in court, which

demonstrates the approach of the Learned High Court Judge was not with an open

mind but with a set of acquitting the accused. It was argued that the cause of death

of the deceased was established and however, the Learned High Court Judge was

of the opinion that the same has not been established since the prosecution failed to

call a pharmacist to give evidence.

The Learned Counsel for the accused argued that it is unfair to draw attention of

this Court only to JMO's evidence in examination-in-chief since his evidence under

cross-examination was different and inconsistent. It was further contended that the

Government Analyst's report and evidence of the Assistant Government Analyst

Page 6 of 17

are also inconclusive due to its failure to disclose the quantity of barbiturate found

in the deceased's body.

However, it is observed that even though the said witnesses were cross-examined

in a lengthy manner, the cause of death was not disputed. Other possibilities such

as the effect of birth control pills were ruled out.

In the case of Mobomed Uvais alias Paraniam Suresb V. Tbe Republic [2014

BASL LR 514], it was held that,

"In the light of the above judicial decisions, I hold that whenever evidence

given by a witness on a material point is not challenged in cross-

examination, it has to be concluded that such evidence is not disputed and is

accepted by the opponent subject of course to the qualification that the

witness is a reliable witness ... "

Even though the Learned Counsel for the accused argued that the Assistant

Government Analyst's incompetency of drugs and on barbiturate and their toxic

effect was evident from her evidence, it is noteworthy that the Counsel for the

accused in the High Court had admitted the qualifications of the Assistant

Government Analyst at the beginning of her evidence. Further, I observe that even

though Dr. Alwis and the Assistant Government Analyst were cross-examined on

the quantity of Barbiturate found in the body, the fact that it was found in certain

parts of the deceased's body was not disputed. Therefore, I am of the view that the

Learned High Court Judge should not have required the prosecution to call further

witnesses to establish something which had already been established.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner pointed out certain portions in

the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge being irrational and unreasonable.

Page 7 of 17

It was argued that the evidence in relation to the behaviour of the accused when the

accused cleaned the deceased's toes and rubbed her head had been taken out of

context. The Learned High Court Judge had not taken into consideration the fact

that the petitioner stated that the accused was acting under a pretense. It was

further submitted by the President's Counsel that the Learned High Court Judge

explained away the position of the prosecution that the accused had adulterated the

murukku with Barbiturate on the grounds that the accused was not such an

advanced person to carry out such a thing.

The Learned Counsel for the accused, III answenng the above contention,

submitted that even though the prosecution endeavored to draw an inference that

the relationship between the accused and the deceased was a pretense, the

prosecution failed to do so.

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge was easily convinced that there was a

loving relationship between the accused and the deceased. However, I observe that

the version of the accused on the incident related to the photographs with another

woman was full of inconsistency. Surprisingly, the Learned High Court Judge was

very convinced that the relationship with the other woman had ceased after the

marriage even in the absence of any evidence to prove so. The Learned High Court

Judge made the following observation;

' .... OlO& @oel153<!l e.:l@lco e.:lOJIB <:fZlf~@lC) col5i ~J<!lJ6to @025i~ ~O erzl53

@025i~ ~oZlf@25i ZS)lZSl ... " (P 02 - Page 13 of the brief)

The Learned Counsel for the accused submitted that the Learned High Court Judge

concluded that an inference of a strained and dexterously manipulated relationship

Page 8 of 17

where the accused had a hidden motive with a need to get rid of the deceased could

not be drawn legitimately. However, it is noteworthy that the accused was married

to that woman in the said photographs, subsequent to the death of the deceased.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Learned High Court

Judge failed to analyze evidence of Mewan Sampath correctly. The Learned

Counsel for the accused submitted that it is justified that evidence of Mewan

Sampath was rejected since the prejudicial effect of his evidence against the

accused is out proportion to its probative value.

The Learned High Court Judge made the following observation;

However, I observe that the petitioner was the uncle of Mewan Sampath and he

was 19 years of age at the time of incident. He was 23 years when he gave

evidence at the non-summary proceedings. I am of the view that the Learned High

Court Judge erred in rejecting the evidence of Mewan since his evidence was

consistent and was not contradicted in any manner. The decision of the Learned

High Court Judge to reject his evidence was not justifiably explained as well.

The Learned High Court Judge decided to reject the evidence of house maid,

Nalani since it is inconceivable that the accused would ask a domestic aid who had

been with the family for less than a month to make a cup of tea in order to mix

some medicine to be given to the deceased.

Nalani in her letter written to the husband had mentioned that she would receive a

lot of land if he continued to stay with the deceased. While testifying, she had

stated that the accused promised to give her a land of 10 perches if she made a cup

of tea to be given to the deceased. The Learned High Court Judge was of the view

that evidence of said Nalani was unreliable since aforesaid portion of evidence

amounted to a major contradiction. Upon perusal of the proceedings, I find it

difficult to agree with the above conclusion of the Learned High Court Judge.

In the case of The AG V. Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2 Sri L.R. 144, it was

observed that,

"When faced with contradictions in a witness's testimonial, the court must

bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions, viwed in light

of the whole of the evidence given by the witness. The court must also come

to a determination regarding whether this contradiction was an honest

mistake on the part of the witness or whether it was a deliberate attempt

to mislead court ... "

In the case of Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka (2010) 2 Sri LR 241, it was

held that,

"Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge. Court of

appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of trial Judge with regard to the

credibility of a witness unless such findings are manifestly wrong. This is

because the trial Judge has the advantage of seeing the demeanour and

deportment of the witness ... "

Page 10 of 17

In the case of State of UP V. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48), it was held that,

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

court to scrutinise the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief Minor

discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there

from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed

by the investigating officer not going to the: root of the matter would not

ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before

whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion

about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation

of evidence by the trial court and unless there are reasons weighty and

formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of

minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details ... "

In light of above, it is understood that undue importance cannot be attached to

minor contradictions and discrepancies. I observe that the Learned High Court

Judge had attached such undue importance to unnecessary portions of evidence in

the prosecution case. I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge clearly

erred in rejecting the evidence of Nalani in the absence of any material

Page 11 of 17

contradiction and clearly her evidence created a ring of truth when taken as a

whole.

Further, I observe that Violet Warnakulasuriya, testified that the accused had

threatened to kill the petitioner and his wife if he had been remanded for even one

day in connection with the death of the deceased (Pl3 - Page 13). The Learned

High Court Judge rejected this too, on the basis that such statement could be made

by a person who has been 'angered' due to the death of his wife. It is shocking to

have such a comment by the Learned Trial Judge. At that time, it was not even

suspected that the deceased was murdered. I find it quite unreasonable that the

Learned High Court Judge proceeded to reject evidence of prosecution, including

expert witnesses, without proper reasoning.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner contended that the Learned

High Court Judge interrupted the cross-examination of the accused in an extensive

manner, and thereby his line of questions was disturbed.

The Learned Counsel for the accused, in reply to the above contention, submitted

that intervention of the Learned High Court Judge did not cause a miscarriage of

justice. The Learned Counsel for the accused submitted the cases of The Queen V.

A. Nimalasena de Zoysa [60 NLR 97J and Rex V. Wijedasa Perera [52 NLR

29] in support of his submission.

As per section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance,

"The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant

facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness,

or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant, and may order the

production of any document or thing and neither the parties nor their agents

shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor,

Page 12 of 17

without the leave of the court, to cross examine any witness upon any

answer given in reply to any such question.

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this

Ordinance to be relevant and duly proved ... "

The Learned Counsel for the accused submitted the case of The Queen V. A.

Nimalasena de Zoysa [60 NLR 97], in which it was held that,

" ... that the mere fact that the trial Judge has, by availing himself of the

power vested in him by section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, put a large

number of questions to a witness is not a ground for quashing a conviction,

even if the number of questions is greater than that put by the prosecution or

the defence. To quash the conviction the Court of Criminal Appeal must be

satisfied that the multiplicity of the questions asked by the trial Judge

resulted in a miscarriage of just ice ... "

In the case of The Queen V. Abeyratne (1962) CLW 69, it was held,

"section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance undoubtedly empowers a Judge, in

order to discover or to obtain proper proof or relevant facts, to ask any

question he pleases in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties

about any fact relevant or irrelevant; but in the instant case some of the

questions put by the Learned Commissioner do not seem to fall within the

ambit of that section, which wide as it is, has its limitation in the words

order to discover or to obtain proper proof or relevant facts " ... "

" . In

In the case of E.L. Senanayake V. G.B. de Silva and 2 others (1972) 75 NLR

409, it was held,

Page 13 of 17

"that the power conferred on the Court by section 165 of the Evidence

Ordinance to put questions to a witness is subject to inherent limitations ... "

In the case of The Queen V. M.L.P. Mendis Appu and another [60 CLW 11], it

was held that,

"The powers conferred by section 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code

should be used with caution. In a trial by jury the functions of the

prosecution, the defence and the Judge are laid down in the Code and the

Court should take care not to leave room for any impression that the court is

using its power under section 429 to help the prosecution to discharge the

burden that rests on it. The powers conferred by section 165 are limited

and are not meant to be used for the purpose of discrediting a witness or

an accused person. For, to do so would not be 'to discover or to obtain

proper proof of relevant facts '. " (Emphasis added)

In light of above, I am of the view that even though a Judge is empowered to

question a witness in certain circumstances, he is not empowered to go on a voyage

of discovery. I observe that in the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge had

interfered with the cross-examining of the accused, sometimes even asking

questions on facts like previous romantic relationships of the deceased. I find most

of these questions to be irrelevant and prejudicial.

The Learned Counsel for the accused submitted that the petitioner has failed to

prove any complaint against the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge which

falls within exceptional circumstances.

In the case of M.Roshan Dilruk Fernando V. AG rCA (PHC) 03/2016], it was

held that,

Page 14 of 17

"It is settled law that the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision can be

invoked only on establishing the exceptional circumstances. The requirement

of exceptional circumstances has been held in a series of authorities. Ameen

v. Rasheed 3 CLW 8, Rastom v. Hapangama [19787-79J 2 Sri L R 225,

Cader (on behalf of Rashid Kahan) V s Officer - In - Charge Narcotics

Bureau, [2006J3 Sri LR 74, Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and others V.

Commissioner of Labour [1998J 3 SriLR 320 are some of the authorities

where it has been emphasized that unless the existences of the exceptional

circumstances are been established in cases where an alternative remedy is

available, revisionary jurisdiction cannot be invoked. .. "(Emphasis added)

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others (2004) 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

In the case of Mariam Beebee V. Seyed Mohamed [68 NLR 36] it was held that,

"The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent

of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Its object is the

due administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes

committed by this court itself, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice ... "

After a careful consideration of all the facts mentioned above, I am of the view that

there had been a miscarriage of justice due to the failure of the Learned High Court

Judge to evaluate evidence of the prosecution with a judicial mind. Most of the

Page 15 of 17

incriminating evidence were unreasonably rejected whereas unnecessary evidence

were admired out of context. I am of the view that these circumstances do in fact

amount to exceptional circumstances in order to invoke the revisionary powers of

this Court.

Considering above, I set aside the judgment of acquitting the accused-respondent

by the Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha dated 29.1l.2006, and order the

case to be sent for re-trial before a different High Court Judge.

The Learned High Court Judge is directed to hear and determine the case

expeditiously.
