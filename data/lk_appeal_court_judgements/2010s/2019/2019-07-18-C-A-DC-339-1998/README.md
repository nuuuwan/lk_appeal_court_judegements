01. Plaintiffs Respondents (Plaintiffs) instituted the above partition action in the

District Court ofKalutara to partition the land called 'Heendiganowitawatta'

in extent of about 01 Acre, more fully described in the schedule to the plaint.

The only dispute among the Plaintiffs and the Defendant Appellant

(Appellant) was the identity of the corpus. Disputes with regard to the

pedigree were settled among the parties. After trial, the learned District

Judge delivering his judgment on 30.03.1998 accepted the identity of the

corpus as shown in the preliminary plan No. 4887 prepared by Licensed

Surveyor W. Seneviratne marked as 'X', and made order to partition the

land as prayed for by the Plaintiffs. Being aggrieved by the said judgment,

Appellant preferred this appeal.

02. Contention of the Appellant is that the preliminary plan No.4887 does not

show the land sought to be partitioned correctly. Appellant's position is that

lots Oland 02 in the preliminary plan 4887 consists of portions of another

land called 'MahathottamOwita' alias 'Mahathotaowita', which is the

subject matter of the partition case bearing No. 5143P pending in the same

District Court which has been instituted prior to the instant partition case.

Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the lands sought to be partitioned

in this case in plan 4887 (lots Oland 02), are the lots D and B shown in the

plan No. 3102 which is the preliminary plan in case No. 5143P. Therefore,

Appellant has sought the lots Oland 02 in plan 4887 should be excluded

from this case.

03. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that in terms of the schedule in the

plaint in case No. 5183P the extent of the land 'HeendiganowiteWatta' is

around 01 acre. According to the schedule in the plaint in case No. 5183P,

land 'MahathottamOwita' is the land adjoining the land sought to be

partitioned and it is to the northern boundary of 'Heendiganowite Watta'. It

is further submitted that in terms of the schedule in the plaint in case No.

5143P, land sought to be partitioned is 'MahathottamOwita', which is to the

Northern boundary of 'HeendiganOwita' .The extent of 'MahathottamOwita'

as per the schedule is 03 acres 0 roods and 32 perches. It is submitted further

that in almost all the deeds submitted, the extent ofland 'HeendiganOwita is

about 01 acre. There are no deeds to show that 'MahathottamOwita' is a

land with extent of 03 acres except deed No. 61 dated 14.11.1987. However,

the said deed refers to deed No. 178 which described the land

'MahatottamOwita' has an extent about 03 roods. Hence, it is submitted that

it is erroneous to accept that 'MahatottamOwita' has an extent of 03 acres.

04. In case No 5143P, Plaintiffs Respondents in this case had been the 3rd and 4th

Defendants, and the Appellant in this case had been the Plaintiff. The

learned Trial Judge in that case has delivered the judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff. Judgment in case No. 5143 was marked as IV6 in case No. 5183P.

Counsel for the Appellant with his written submissions has filed the copy of

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in case No. 5143P (C.A. No. 58/95F)

delivered on 20.08.2008. It is pertinent to note that Court of Appeal has set

aside the judgment on case No. 5143P and has ordered a trial de novo. In

paragraph 35 of his submission dated 30.11.2018, counsel submitted that the

proceedings in case No. 5143P are laid by until the conclusion of the instant

appeal.

05. In case No.5183P, on behalf of the Appellant, surveyor Alexandor Fonseka

who prepared plan No. 1075 had been called to testify. According to him, he

has assisted Surveyor V.M.de Silva to survey the land in plan 3102 (1 V7).

He has prepared the plan No.l075 (lVI0). However, in cross examination

he admitted that he did not have the original of old plan No.6125 which was

superimposed on plan No.l075. He admitted that he did not have that old

plan even at the time of survey (Page 221 of the brief). He then admitted that

he had not mentioned in his report on plan No. 1075, the fact that he

superimposed the said old plan. Then he admitted that there were no land

marks found in respect of plan 6125 when he surveyed. He also admitted

that he did not superimpose the preliminary plan No. 4887 on his plan No.

1075. He therefore admitted that he is unable to say what lots in plan No.

4887 are in his plan No. 1075. On this evidence of the surveyor Alexandor

Fonseka, the learned Trial Judge in his judgment in this case (51831P) has

rightly concluded that the Court cannot act on his evidence.

06. Boundaries to the land mentioned in the schedule to the plaint in this case

tallies with the boundaries mentioned in the preliminary plan 'X'.

07. When deciding on the corpus to be partitioned, not only the boundaries but

also the extent of the land would be useful. When the 2nd Plaintiff Vijitha

Hemawathi de Silva gave evidence on the pedigree, she referred to the deed

No. 25703 dated 26.06.1936. As she could not obtain a certified copy of that

deed, she submitted a letter from the Land Registry Kalutara as P6, stating

that a certified copy could not be issued as the deed is destroyed (Page 128

and 129 of the court record). At that stage the Defendant (Appellant)

submitted the original deed as '1 VI' from their custody. On perusing the

said deed 1 VI which is admitted by the Appellant, it is clear that both

5

."

'MahathottamOwiteWatta and 'HeendiganowiteWatta' are adjoining lands.

Both these lands are mentioned in the schedule in 1 VI. Also it is clear that

the extent of 'MahathottamOwiteWatta is around 02 acres, not 03 acres as

mentioned by the Appellant. It is also clear that the extent of the land,

HeendiganOwitewatta' which is the corpus in this case is about 01 acre.

Schedules of all other deeds marked as PI, P2, P4, P5, P7, P8 shows that the

extent of the land 'Heendiganowitawatta' is around 01 acre. It is also

pertinent to note that according to the schedules of the deeds marked

P3,P7,P8 as well as IVI (submitted by the Appellant), the extent of the land

'MahatottamOwitaWatta', which is adjoining 'HeendiganOwitawatta, is

around 02 acres, not 03 acres as mentioned by the Appellant. Hence, on the

basis of the boundaries as well as the schedules of the deeds, the learned

Trial Judge was right when he found that the land 'Heendiganowitawatta' is

depicted in the preliminary plan No.4887 marked as 'X'.

Hence the appeal is dismissed with costs.
