Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Respondents.

Decided on: 13.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners, mother and son respectively, filed this

application seeking (a) to quash by way of writ of certiorari the

Quit Notice served on the 1st petitioner under the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act to evict the 1st petitioner from the

land described in the said Quit Notice and the Magistrates

Court proceedings initiated thereon; (b) to prohibit the

respondents by way of writ of prohibition from taking any steps

under the said Law to evict her from the land until a Land

Kachcheri is held; and (c) to direct the 1st respondent, Divisional

Secretary of Madhu, by way of writ of mandamus, to hold a Land

Kachcheri in respect of this land.

Notwithstanding the petition is running into 37 pages with 99

paragraphs (except the prayer), and 50 documents annexed, the

matter to be decided is very simple. I make use of this

opportunity to make the general observation that pleadings shall

be presented to Court without prolixity for otherwise Court will

not be able to see the wood for the trees.

The petitioners admit that the land described in the Quit Notice

is a State Land. That is why they want this Court to compel the

Divisional Secretary of Madhu to hold a Land Kachcheri and to

take steps to convey the land to the petitioners by way of a

Grant.

The 1st petitioner in paragraph 20 of the petition admits that by

Permit dated 25.01.1983 marked P9 issued under the Land

Development Ordinance, the 1st petitioner got the land identified

as LDO 24 Madhu Road, about 1 Acre in extent, which is the

3

adjoining premises to the one described in the Quit Notice. She

is admittedly in possession of that LotLDO 24 Madhu Road. If

she says that she has not been placed in full possession of that

Lot, the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st respondent was

prepared to put her in full possession of that Lot. But she did

not accept that offer for obvious reasons.

The parcel of land described in the Quit Notice in extent about 1

Acre, according to paragraph 51 of the petition, lies to the West

of her Permit landLDO 24 of Madhu Road.

It is her contention that they possessed that land with a

successful business of a bakery and eatery for a long time until

they were forced to flee due to LTTE problems.

In paragraph 45 of the petition she says that, after the civil war

was over, when she returned to Madhu Road in June 2010

under the Government sponsored resettlement scheme to settle

the internally displaced persons, she found that the said parcel

of land which is now in dispute was being possessed by two

former LTTE activists. In paragraph 57 she says, up to date,

those two former LTTE activists are in possession of that land.

Writ is a discretionary remedy. The 1st petitioner has been given

a parcel of land about 1 Acre in extent along Madhu Road by

way of a Permit issued under the Land Development Ordinance.

Now she wants the adjoining land also about 1 Acre in extent

along Madhu Road. These are commonly known as business

premises due to famous Madhu Church being close by.

This Court cannot by way of mandamus force the 1st respondent

to hold a Land Kachcheri in respect of this land (and consider

the application of the 1st respondent favourably). Land

Kachcheris are conducted according to established procedures

with strict guidelines to followvide inter alia R3-R5. They

cannot be held in an ad hoc manner. Court cannot supervise

the Land Kachcheris.

The allegation of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the

land described in the Quit Notice is not identifiable is beside the

point as the petitioner herself admits that the said State land

lies to the West of her Permit LandLDO 24. So long as her

Permit land is secured, she does not need to worry about other

State lands.

In paragraph 91 of the petition the learned counsel for the

petitioners states that the affidavit filed before the Magistrates

Court is defective for the reason that, in the jurat, there is no

mention whether the facts were affirmed to or sworn. At the

beginning of the affidavit it is stated that the 1st respondent

affirms to the facts therein. Hence there is no necessity repeat it

in the juratvide De Silva v. L.B. Finance Ltd. [1993] 1 Sri LR

371.

I see no reason to quash the Quit Notice and Magistrates Court

proceedings initiated thereon.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
