Tendered on behalf of the 1st Respondent on 5th

December 2018 and 3rd June 2019

17th June 2019

When this matter was taken up on 13th May 2019, the learned Counsel for all

parties moved that judgment be delivered on the written submissions that

would be filed by the parties. While written submissions have been tendered

on behalf of the Petitioners and the 1st Respondent, written submissions have

not been tendered on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, inspite of being afforded

several opportunities of doing so.

2

The Petitioners have filed this application, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to cancel the registration granted by the 1st

Respondent to three organisations, namely Masjid-un-Noor Jummah

Mosque, Masjidun Noor Jummah Mosque and Madrasathun Noor;

b) A Writ of Mandamus to inquire into the registration of the said

organisations and the activities of the said organizations;

c) A Writ of Mandamus to accept the application of the 1st Petitioner to

register the Weliwita Jumma Mosque.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 2nd Petitioner states that he is the President of the Jama-athul Muslimeen,

an Islamic call and guidance centre which the Petitioners state is registered

with the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs as a Muslim

welfare association. The 1st Petitioner states that he is the President of the

Kaduwela Branch of the said Jama-athul Muslimeen, which the Petitioners

claim is responsible for the operation of a mosque at premises No. 37C, Araliya

Mawatha, Weliwita, Kaduwela. The 1st Petitioner states that he is the owner of

the said premises and that he has donated the said premises to the Jama-athul

Muslimeen, subject to his life interest. This Court must observe that the

Petitioners have not produced any documentary proof to support their

position that a Mosque is being carried out at the said premises by them.

3

The 1st Petitioner states that he made an application to the 1st Respondent to

register the Weliwita Jummah Mosque at the aforementioned address. The

Petitioners state that one of the requirements for the registration of a mosque

is that the land on which the Mosque is situated should belong to the person

making the application for the registration of the Mosque. The Petitioners

sta-te that they have complied with this require-me-Rt. The 1st Petitioner states

lurthe-r-t1;l-at_the 1 s~ ~ Respondent has refused to accept the said application a

three other organizations, namely Masjid-un-Noor Jummah Mosque, Masjidun

Noor Jummah Mosque and Madrasathun Noor have been registered by the 1st

Respondent at the same address as that of the Petitioners. The Petitioners

claim that the registration of the aforementioned Mosque and other

organisations at the said address is utra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent

as the said Mosque and the organisations do not have any ownership to the

said land and that consequently, the refusal by the 1st Respondent to accept

the application of the 1st Petitioner on the basis that a Mosque and other

organisations have been registered at the said address is illegal. It is in these

circumstances that the Petitioners have sought the aforementioned relief.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the 1st and 3rd Respondents

have taken up the position that granting approval for the registration of a

Mosque is the function of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs

Board and that the failure on the part of the Petitioners to name the said

Board and its members is fatal to the maintainability of this application.

The learned Senior State Counsel has also taken up the position that approval

has not been granted by the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs

Board for the registration of the Mosque belonging to the Petitioners and

4

therefore, the 1st Respondent is under no legal obligation to register the said

Mosque.

The long title of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Board Act

No. 13 of 1956, as amended (the Act) specifies that it is an Act to provide for

the regi-s-tration of Mos-ques, Muslim shrines and places of religiO-us resort.

-Whlle---S-e-etiQn_2(lLof the Act provides for the appointment of a Directar--Di __

Mosques and Muslim Charitable Trusts, in terms of Section 5(1) of the Act, the

Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Board has been established

for the pu rposes of th is Act.

Section 10(2) of the Act requires the trustee for the time being of a Mosque, or

if there is no such trustee, the person for the time being in charge of a

Mosque, opened for public worship on or after the appointed date1 to make a

written application to the Board for the registration of that Mosque within six

months after the date on which that Mosque is so opened. Section 11(1) of the

Act specifies that upon receipt of an application under Section 10, the Wakfs

Board may, require the applicant to furnish to the Wakfs Board, within such

time as may be specified in the notice, all such information and documents

regarding the Mosque to which that application relates as the Wakfs Board

may consider necessary. In terms of Section 13 of the Act, after obtaining any

such information that the Wakfs Board may require, the Board shall cause that

Mosque to be registered in the register of Mosques by the entry therein of the

prescribed pa rticulars relating to that Mosque.

1 Section 58 - appointed date means th e 1

st of May, 1957.

5

This Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel that the responsibility of granting approval for the registration of a

Mosque is vested with the Wakfs Board. Thus, it is paramount that the Board

and/or the members of the Board should have been named as parties to this

application. This Court is of the view that the Board and/or their members are

necessary parties for a proper determination of the Writ of-Mal1d_?i!ll!s soug_~t

hy the~-e:-tit~~Fi~ccept their applicatioo to register their Mosque and-=-tllat --

an order in this regard cannot be made in the absence of the Wakfs Board.

This Court would nonetheless consider each of the relief prayed for by the

Petitioners, especially in view of the serious allegations that the Petitioners

have made against the 2nd Respondent and the aforementioned Mosque and

the organisations.

This Court would first consider the Writ of Mandamus sought by the

Petitioners directing the 1st Respondent to register the Weliwita Jummah

Mosque.

The Petitioners have not submitted any material to this Court to establish that

they have in fact submitted an application to the Wakfs Board, in terms of

Section 10(2) of the Act or that approval has been granted by the Wakfs Board

for the registration of their Mosque in terms of Section 13 of the Act. In the

absence of any proof of registration by the Wakfs Board of the Weliwita

Jummah Mosque which the Petitioners claim is operated by them, this Court is

of the view that the 1st Respondent is under no statutory obligation to register

the Mosque of the 1st Petitioner. Hence, this Court is of the view that the

6

Petitioners are not entitled to seek a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

Respondent to accept their application.

This Court would now consider the Writ of Certiorari sought by the Petitioners

to cancel the registrations of the aforementioned Mosque and other

organisations.

The 2nd Respondent has submitted with his Statement of Objections marked

'R1'1 a letter dated 19th November 2012 issued by the 1st Respondent, which is

re-produced below:2

"The Trustees,

Masjidun Noor Jummah Mosque,

No. 37, Araliya Mawatha,

Weliwita,

Kaduwela.

Registration of Masjidun Noor Jummah Mosque

I am pleased to inform you that the Wakfs Board of Sri Lanka has

approved the registration of the above named Mosque with this

Department.

Subsequently, t he Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs

has registered the aforesaid Mosque with effect from 2012.09.16 and

assigned with Registration No. R/2017/C 103./1

2 This letter has been produced by the 1,t Respondent marked 'lR3a'.

7

The 2nd Respondent has also produced marked 'R2', the certificate of

registration issued by the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs

certifying that, "the Wakfs Board has been pleased to register the Masjidun

Noor jummah Mosque situated at No. 37, Araliya Mawatha, Weliwita,

Kad-uwela in terms ot-Section 13 of the Wakfs Act."

The 1st Respondent has submitted with his Statement of Objections marked

'lR3' the minutes of the meeting of the Wakfs Board held on 16th September

2012 granting approval to register the Masjidun Noor Jummah Mosque.

However, it appears from 'lR2' that approval has been granted

notwithstanding the fact that the deed to the land on which the Mosque was

to be situated was not in order.

The 1st Respondent has also produced with his Statement of Objections

marked 'lR6' a letter dated 3rd July 2008 issued by the Department of Muslim

and Cultural Affairs confirming that the 'Madarasathun Noor' situated at No.

37, Araliya Mawath, Weliwita, Kaduwela has been registered with the said

Department.

This Court is at a loss to understand how the registration of the said Mosque

and the 'Madarasathun Noor' was recognized and effected by the 1st

Respondent as borne out by 'Rl' and 'lR6' respectively, if the requirement for

registration stipulated by the 1st Respondent that the applicant must have title

to the land had not been complied with.

8

It is in the above factual background that the Petitioners have alleged that the

registration of the Masjid-un-Noor Jummah Mosque, Masjidun Noor Jummah

Mosque and Madrasathun Noor is not in accordance with the law. While

claiming that the above organisations are not operating at the said address and

are fake organisations, the Petitioners have also made serious allegations of

fraud ag~~-n~! the 2nd Re-spondentw_ho _is a T~~stee _ of ~~e !Y1asjid-un-~oor

Jumma~Mru;M-e-,-~~_ _ __ _ _ ___ _

This Court observes that the Petitioners ought to have complained to the

Wakfs Board if they were dissatisfied with the registration granted by the

Wakfs Board to the aforementioned Mosque and other organizations. In fact, if

such a complaint had been made, the Wakfs Board could have acted under

Section 13C of the Act after a proper inquiry.4 In these circumstances, this

Court is not inclined to grant the Writ of Certiorari to quash the registrations

that have been issued by the 1st Respondent pursuant to the approval granted

by the Wakfs Board.

However, in view of the serious allegations made by the Petitioners against the

2nd Respondent and the Mosque of which he is a Trustee, and the other

organisations, it is the view of this Court that the 1st Respondent has a public

duty to inquire into the activities of the said organisations, instead of merely

granting registration and turning a blind eye to complaints made against such

organisations.

3 Paragraphs 8 and 11 of the Written Submissions filed by the Petitioners on 13th May 2019,

4 Section 13C reads as follows : "If at any time the Board is satisfied that it has caused a mosque to be

regist ered by reason of a mistake of law or of fact, it shall be lawful for the Board to cause the entry relating to that mosque to be deleted from the register of mosques, and such mosque shall be deemed to be not regist ered with effect from the date of such deletion,"

9

In these circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Mandamus in terms of

paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition, directing the 1st Respondent to

conduct an investigation in terms of the law into the affairs of the 2nd

Respondent, the Masjid-un-Noor Jummah Mosque, the Masjidun Noor

Jummah Mosque and the Madrasathun Noor and to take steps thereafter in

terms of the law.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
