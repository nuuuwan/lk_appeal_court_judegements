Counsel: W. Dayaratne, P.C., with Nadeeka Arachchi for

the Petitioners.

Defendant-Respondents.

S.N. Wijithsingh for the 23rd Defendant-

Respondent.

Decided on: 18.10.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners to this revision application are the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th,

30th and 31st Defendants in a partition case pending in the District

Court of Mt. Lavinia. They filed this application seeking to set aside

the Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree entered in that case.

The Plaintiff filed the action by plaint dated 25.03.1991 to partition

the land among the Plaintiff and the 1st-10th Defendants in the manner

stated in paragraph 25 to the plaint, and leave the remining portion of

the land unallotted as he was unaware of the entitlements to the said

portion of the land.

There is no dispute that the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st

Defendants were served with summons. According to the Journal

Entry No. 7 dated 27.04.1992, the summonses have been served and

the Notice on the land has been affixed by the Fiscal. The same

4

Journal Entry also points to the fact that the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th and

30th Defendants were present in Court on that summons returnable

date. The Journal Entry No. 10 dated 10.08.1992 confirms the filing

of the proxy of the 31st Defendant.

The original petition of the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st

Defendants is dated 31.12.2001. This has later been amended by the

amended petition dated 20.01.2002. However, no documents have

been annexed to the amended petition to substantiate their case.

Nevertheless, when I have a look at the original petition, in paragraph

13 thereof, the said Defendants have given a full description of the

supporting documents tendered with the petition. According to that

paragraph, out of the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants,

only the 28th and 30th Defendants have filed statements of claim, and

others have not. But I find that, according to paragraph 7 of the

statement of objections of the Plaintiff dated 01.07.2002, the 29th

Defendant has also filed a statement of objection.

According to P3, on 20.05.1997, the case has been taken up for trial,

and the Plaintiff, the 32nd Defendant and the 34th Defendant have

given evidence. Page 1 of P3 reveals that, out of the 17th, 27th, 28th,

29th, 30th and 31st Defendants, except the 17th, 27th and 31st

Defendants, other Defendants had been represented by an Attorney

at Law. Trial has been concluded on the same day, without contest, in

that, disputed matters have been sorted out or settled during the

course of evidence.

As seen from Journal Entries 50-56, after the conclusion of the trial,

the case had been called in open Court for 5 times for corrections,

tendering documents etc., and at last, the Judgment had been

delivered on 08.12.1997.

By that Judgment, undivided rights have been given to the Plaintiff,

the 1st-3rd, 7th-10th, 18th-23rd, 33rd-35th Defendants; and out of 35348

shares, 6419 shares have been left unallotted. That means, the 17th,

27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants have not been given any

shares.

Then the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants have filed this

application seeking to set aside the Judgment and the Interlocutory

Decree, 4 years after the said Judgment. This delay is unreasonable,

unexplained and unjustifiable. Needless to emphasize that a party

seeking a discretionary relief such as revision shall come to Court with

promptitude.

Out of the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants, the 28th-30th

Defendants cannot, in my view, complain anything as they were

represented by an Attorney-at-Law at the trial.

The 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants, in their counter

objections dated 10.08.2002 state that, the 17th, 27th and 31st

Defendants were neither present nor represented at the trial date. So

what? The Plaintiff correctly made them parties to the case, but

stated that their entitlements to the land are not known to him. The

17th, 27th and 31st Defendants seem to have filed proxies, but

6

remained silent without filing statements of claim. If they did not file

statements of claim, claiming their entitlements to the land, in terms

of section 25(2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, as amended,

they become parties in default who cannot participate in the trial

without the leave of Court. Section 25(2) of the Partition Law reads

as follows:

If a defendant shall fail to file a statement of claim on the due date, the

trial may proceed ex parte as against such party in default, who shall not

be entitled, without the leave of court, to raise any contest or dispute the

claim of any other party to the action at the trial.

That means, even if the 17th, 27th and 31st Defendants were present

and represented on the trial date, there would not have been a

material difference as they could not have, as of right, contest the case

of the Plaintiff.

But the District Court can, upon a proper application under section

25(3) being made, allow a defaulting party to file a statement of claim

and participate in the trial subject to conditions, until the Judgment is

delivered. (vide section 48.)

Section 25(3) reads as follows:

The court may permit a party in default to participate in the trial after

notice to the other parties to the action affected by the claim or dispute set

up or raised by such party in default, on being satisfied of the bona fides of

7

such claim or dispute, and upon such terms as to costs and filing of a

statement of claim or otherwise as the court shall deem fit.

Such an application has not been made to the District Court by the

defaulting parties.

When the Plaintiff makes the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st

Defendants parties to the case and states that he is unaware of the

entitlements of those Defendants; and the said Defendants fail to

state Court on what basis they claim to have rights to the land to be

partitioned; it cannot now lie in the mouth of the said Defendants to

say that: this is a partition action, and the District Judge has failed to

investigate title of the said Defendants to the land, and therefore the

Judgment shall be set aside.

In Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan1, Anandacoomaraswamy J. stated:

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant cited several authorities

Goonaratne v. Bishop of Colombo2, Peries v. Perera3, Neela Kutty v.

Alvar4, Cooray v. Wijesuriya5, Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas6 and

Sheefa v. Colombo Municipal Council7, and stated that it is the duty of

the Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the

judgement is a judgement in rem.

We are not unmindful of these authorities and the proposition that it is the

duty of the Court to investigate title in a partition action, but the Court

can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest,

evidence both documentary and oral. Court cannot go on a voyage of

discovery tracing the title and finding the shares in the corpus for them,

otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and expect the Court to do

their work and their Attorney-at-Law's work for them to get title to those

shares in the corpus.

If the said Defendants think fit, they can make an application to the

District Court to secure their rights from the portion of the corpus

left unallotted. (Dantanarayana v. Nonahamy8, Sapin Singho v. Luwis

Singho9)

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not think that this is a

fit and proper case for this Court to invoke the extraordinary

jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the Judgment and the

Interlocutory Decree entered thereon.

Application of the 17th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th and 31st Defendants is

dismissed but without costs.
