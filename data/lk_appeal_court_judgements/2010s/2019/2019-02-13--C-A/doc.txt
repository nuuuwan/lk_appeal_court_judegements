BEFORE : M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J. COUNSEL : S. A. D. S. Suraweera for the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant Rohan Shabandu P.C. for the Plaintiff-Respondent

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TENDERED ON : 29.08.2018 (by the 2nd Defendant-Appellant) 12.07.2018 (by the Plaintiff-Respondent) DECIDED ON : 07.02.2019

M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent)

instituted this partition action on 03.10.1991 against the Defendants

seeking to partition the lands called Lots 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10A and 10B of

Mahagedarawatte alias Kopiwatta containing in extent 2 Roods and 13

Perches.

The original plaint was subsequently amended by the Respondent on

23.02.1994. As per the said amended plaint, the Respondent stated that as

per the final decree marked P1, entered in the Partition Case beating No.

5590 the Lots 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10A and 10B were allotted as follows:

Lot 4 T. Araliyas De Silva Lot 5 T. Owishamy

3

Lot 7 Kalugala Corenelishamy Lot 8 Kalugala Karthishamy Lot 9 kalugala Basthiyan Lot 10A and 10B Jandoris Appu

According to this final decree entered in the said case, Lot 6 was allotted to

Kalugala Nandoris Silva, and the Lots 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10A and 10B were sold in

execution of writ against the defendants who were allotted the said Lots

and Kalugala Nandoris Silva who was allotted Lot 6 purchased the said

allotments at the sale. The documents which had been produced marked as

P2, P3, P4 and P5 established in fact that to the sale report marked P4

Nandoris Silva was declared the purchaser.

The Respondent in his plaint pleaded that the chain of title commencing

from said Nandoris Silva and claimed a share of 80/96 to him and the

balance share was assigned to the 1st and 3rd to 11th Defendants. The

Respondent further averred that the Appellant who does not have any

rights from and out of the corpus had been named as a party since he is in

forcible occupation and possession of the corpus and in a building thereon.

In contrast, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) filed his statement of claim denying the averments of

respondent and pleaded inter alia that said Nandoris Silva did not have any

title to the land in suit, and his mother Liasohamy had been in possession

and occupation of the entire land even after the final decree in the previous

4

partition action. Thus, the Appellant was claimed a prescriptive title to the

entire corpus.

The case was proceeded to trial on many points of contests raised on

behalf the Respondent and the Appellant. The Respondent raised 8 issues

and gave evidence producing documents X, X1, P1 to P8, whilst the

Appellant raised 2 issues and led his evidence producing documents 2V1 to

2V3.

After conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge delivered his

judgment on 10.06.1999 answering the points of contests in favour of the

Respondent and entered judgment for the Respondent as prayed for in the

plaint.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant preferred this appeal

to set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of Balapitiya.

In this appeal, main averment of the Appellant was that the Respondent

had failed to adduce any fiscals conveyance which would have transferred

title to the alleged purchaser Nandoris Silva. He further alleged that on an

examination of the sale report and the final decree bearing No. 5590, the

said certified copies have been obtained in the year of 1979 and even, at

that stage, the case record had been available in the previous action. But

the Respondent had not obtained a Copy of the Fiscals conveyance.

5

Therefore, it was the position of the Appellant that the Respondent and his

predecessors are not entitled to the benefit of a certificate of sale in the

absence of Fiscals Conveyance which the Respondent do not have.

It is conceded by the Respondent that a Fiscals Conveyance is not available

to be produced, although, the Respondent stated that there was Fiscal sale

supported by the judgment P3, Seizure Notice P2 and Fiscal Report on the

Sale P4. Therefore, the Respondent believes that these documents may

prove the title to the land.

When we read to Section 289 of the Civil Procedure Code it could be

argued that a person is not entitled to claim a clear title from certificate of

sale unless and until a Fiscals Conveyance is executed upon the issuance of

such a certificate. Section 289 of the Civil Procedure Code reads thus:

"The right and title of the judgment-debtor or of any person

holding under him or deriving title through him to immovable

property sold by virtue of an execution is not divested by the

sale until the confirmation of the sale by the court and the

execution of the Fiscal's conveyance. But if the sale is

confirmed by the court and the conveyance is executed in

pursuance of the sale, the grantee in the conveyance is deemed

to have been vested with the legal estate from the time of the

sale".

6

In the case of Muttu Caruppen et al Vs. Rankira et al [13 N.L.R. 326], it

was mentioned that:

"the purchaser at a Fiscal's sale when the sale is confirmed by

Court after the lapse of thirty days, must procure his

conveyance forthwith".

Also, in the case of Hendrick Singho Vs. Kalanis Appu et al [23 N.L.R. 80],

it was held that:

"Section 289 of the Civil Procedure Code does not override the

provisions of Section 238; the title of the purchaser at the

Fiscal's sale does not, on the issue of the Fiscal's Conveyance,

prevail over any intermediate alienation by the execution-

debtor, unless the Fiscal's seizure was registered."

"If the seizure is not registered, the necessary implication of

Section 238 is that a bona fide private alienee is statim secures.

Section 289, as regards relation back, must be read in the light

-of section 328, and it is operation should not be extended to a

case where the seizure has not been registered."

However, this accustomed position has been modified through the decision

of S.C APPEAL 110/2014 [SC Minutes dated 22.11.2017]. In this case, the

Supreme Court held that in a partition action it is not necessary to execute

7

a Fiscal Conveyance consequent to a Decree of Sale in order for title to

effectively pass the purchaser. Anil Gooneratne, J. (agreeing with Sisira J. de

Abrew, J and Vijith K. Malalgoda P.C., J) further observed as follows:

The only point for decision in this case is whether the

certificate of sale confers valid title on the successful purchaser,

at a sale held according to the provisions of the Partition Law.

At this point in this Judgement I have to mention that prior to

the present Partition Law of 1977, we had from earlier times

the Partition Ordinance No. 10 of 1863 and Partition Act No.16

of 1951. The case in hand relates to an alienation of land under

Partition Ordinance No. 10 of 1863. It is a certificate of sale

issued under the hand of the District Judge

In the text on The Law of Partition in Ceylon by D.A.St. V.

Jayawardena Pg. 187 The certificate takes the place of a

conveyance from the former owner to the new owner. The

certificate should

(1) Be signed by the Judge

(2) State that the property was sold on the Order of the Court

(3) Give the names of the purchaser; and

(4) State the purchase money has been duly paid.

8

At. Pg. 188.... Sir Joseph Hutchinson, C. J. in the case of

Cathirihami Vs. Babahamy 11 NLR 20, where he said that the

intention of the Partition Ordinance was to give an indefeasible

title to the purchaser to whom the land was sold when the sale

was affirmed and completed by the certificate of the Court

under Section 8, intended to say anything more than that the

title of the purchaser was indefeasible as regards the estate

that passed to him under the Decree.

I observe, as the description given above on the relevant

certificate of sale and in comparison with the above authority

refer to and demonstrate that the certificate of sale would

pass good title to the purchaser in this case the said O.L.M.

Mohamed Ismail the purchaser.

(Page at 6 & 7 - Emphasis added)

In the above case, said three bench judges from the Supreme Court

overruled the decision of C.A Appeal No. 534/95 (F) [Court of Appeal

Minutes dated 28.01.2014] which was urged the applicability of Section

289 of the Civil Procedure Code.

In the above stated reason, I hold that in this case it is not necessary to

execute a Fiscal Conveyance consequence to a Decree of Sale in order for

title to effectively pass to the purchaser.

The Appellants another contention was that his mother Laishamy is the

person who started possessing the land in suit after the final decree in

5590/P was entered. However, the said Laishamy the Appellants mother

was never a party in the said partition action No. 5590. It is also observed

that no party to the said final decree challenged the shares allotted as per

the said decree, and accordingly the Appellants cannot challenge the said

final decree without a valid basis, therefore, the Trail Judge was mindful of

these facts.

The learned District Judge had observed the evidence given by one

Dharmasena on behalf of the Appellant, that the boutique constructed in

Lot 10A was built in 1990 under the agreement made by the Appellant to

the Respondent to remove same whenever necessary. Also it is seen from

the evidence that the Appellant earlier had agreed to purchase the said

portion of land from the Respondent on several occasions and since the

Appellant is a relative of the Respondent, did not take any action to remove

the said construction made in Lot 10A.

It is further important to note a fact that, when the Appellant giving his

evidence, he stated that he is unaware of Nandoris Silva, but he stated at a

later stage that Nandoris Silva is the grand-father of his mother, and also

once he stated that he is unaware of witness called Dharmasena, but as per

the evidence of Dharmasena he had been to the Appellants house and said

Dharmasena is a son of Nandoris Silva. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge

has concluded the fact that the Appellant is not a credible witness.

10

In regard to this, this Court observes that in the case of De Silva & Others

Vs. Senaviratna and Another [(1981) 2 SLR page at 07]- when an appellate

court is invited to review the findings of the trial judge on the question of

facts, the principles that should be guided is as follows:-

a. where the finding on questions of fact are based upon the

credibility of witnesses on the footing that the trial judges

perception on such evidence, then such findings are entitled to

great weight and the utmost consideration and will be reversed

only if appears to the appellate court that the trail judge has

failed to make full use of his advantage of seeing and listening

to the witnesses and the appellate court is convinced by the

plainest considerations that would be justified in doing so.

b. that however where the of fact are based upon the trail judges

evaluation of facts, the appellate court is then in in as good a

position as the trail judge to evaluate such facts and no

sanctity attaches to such findings of fact of a trial judge.

c. where it appears to an appellate court that on either of the

grounds the findings of fact by a trial judge should be reversed

then the appellate court ought not to shrink from that task

11

Furthermore, the Trial Judge correctly held that the Appellant has not

proved how he becomes entitled to the Lot 11. The said Lot 11 was owned

by Samel Appu who is the father of Laisohamy (the mother of the

Appellant) and the Appellant could not explain how he got an independent

possession from Samel Appu.

It is settled law that a person who claims prescriptive title against the

rightful owner who has the paper title or some other equivalent title has a

very heavy burden to prove all the requirements prescribed in Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance. Therefore, mere possession over ten years is

not prescriptive possession. The possession shall be by title adverse to or

independent of that the rightful owner.

In Sirajudeen Vs. Abbas [(1994) 2SLR 365], it was held that:

where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof

rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for

his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights

In the all circumstances of this case, I am of the firm view that the District

Judge correctly held with the Respondent. Therefore, I do not wish to

interfere with the judgment.

12

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed

but without costs.

Appeal dismissed.
