Before: Janak De Silva J.

Counsel:

Pubudu Alwis for the Petitioner

Charuka Ekanayake SC for 2nd to 7th Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioner on 11.10.2018

2nd to 7th Respondents on 03.07.2018

Argued on: 15.07.2019

Decided on: 29.11.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking the following reliefs:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 5th Respondent contained in document

marked P19;

(b) A writ of mandamus compelling the 2nd to 5th Respondents to hold an inquiry and grant

EPF and ETF in favour of the Petitioner from the 1st Respondent;

(c) Make order referring this dispute to an arbitrator as suggested by the 4th Respondent in

letter marked P16.

The Petitioner was employed by the 1st Respondent from January 1982. His services were

terminated on 15.07.2004 against which termination he made an application to the Labour

Tribunal. The Labour Tribunal on 20.06.2007 held that the termination was unreasonable and

unjust and awarded compensation. However, the 1st Respondent appealed to the Provincial High

Court of Anuradhapura which, on 17.06.2009, while holding the termination to be reasonable

and justifiable reduced the amount of compensation awarded by the Labour Tribunal.

The Petitioner by P3, P3(1) and P3(3) dated 09.08.2007 made an application seeking his statutory

dues of EPF, ETF and gratuity. The Petitioner claims that the 2nd Respondent by letter dated

27.02.2009 (P4) informed the Petitioner that his EPF has been duly paid and it was not possible

to proceed with the application for gratuity as the 1st Respondent did not employ more than 15

employees.

The Petitioner contends that this order was made without conducting a proper inquiry and that

he preferred an appeal [P5(i) and P5(ii)] to the 3rd Respondent which was referred to the 4th

Respondent (P6).

The Petitioner contends that there was a prolonged delay in considering his appeal and that after

several reminders the 4th Respondent submitted a report to the 3rd Respondent (P16) where a

reference is made to refer the dispute for arbitration. Thereafter the 5th Respondent on behalf of

the 3rd Respondent called the chief executive officer of the 1st Respondent for discussion on

08.12.2011 which was copied to the Petitioner (P17).

The 5th Respondent by letter dated 10.10.2012 (P19) informed the Petitioner that his claim for

EPF to be calculated by taking his monthly salary as Rs. 6900/= is denied as it transpires that Rs.

1800/= has been paid as travelling expenses. It is further stated that the claim for gratuity is

rejected as it is not revealed that the 1st Respondent employed 15 or more persons before the

date of termination.

The Petitioner complains that there was no proper inquiry into his complaint. However, P16

shows that the parties were summoned on at least two occasions namely 23.08.2011 and

29.08.2011. P16 also shows that the 4th Respondent considered the documentary evidence

available in several official briefs. The Petitioner was clearly given a hearing and the rules of

natural justice followed.

As for the EPF, in his application for EPF (P3) the Petitioner claimed that his salary was Rs. 6900/=

at the time of termination. However, the Petitioner had in his evidence before the Labour

Tribunal stated that his basic salary was Rs. 5100/= and was given a travelling allowance of Rs.

1800/= (P1 page 12). This is a fact that was correctly considered in P16 and P17.

The Petitioner has in his application for gratuity [P3(i)] has given a list of persons employed by

the 1st Respondent [P3(2)] containing 17 names. However, documents marked 2R1 to 2R3 which

had been submitted to the 2nd Respondent in 2008 shows that three of them were in fact not

employees of the 1st Respondent. For example, Asanka Perera has submitted evidence (2R2) that

he is carrying on a separate business under the name and style of "A.P.I. Distributors". Piyasena

Perera by 2R1 stated that he is conducting a separate business under the name and style of "Royal

Management and Investigations". Suminda Perera has stated that he is not an employee ofthe

1st Respondent (2R3). In the light of this evidence there is no error in the conclusion that the 1st

Respondent did not employee 15 or more persons. Furthermore, 1st Respondent has before this

Court produced evidence (lR2A to 1R2C) of salary particulars of its employees.

,

Where its procedure is not regulated by statute, a tribunal it is free to adopt a procedure of its

own, so long as it conforms to principles of natural justice. It is equally free to receive evidence

from whatever source provided it is logically probative. The only obligation which the law casts

on it is that it should not act on any information which it may receive unless it is put to the party

against whom it is to be used and give him a fairopportunityto explain or refute it. [Chulasubadra

De Silva v. The University of Colombo (1986) 2 Sri.L.R. 288]. There is no allegation that the

Petitioner was not given an opportunity to respond to the evidence relied on by the 1st

Respondent.

The Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the Respondent to hold an inquiry and grant

EPF and ETF in favour of the Petitioner from the 1st Respondent. This application is misconceived

in law as a proper inquiry has already been held.

The Petitioner further seeks an order referring this dispute to an arbitrator as suggested by the

4th Respondent in letter marked P16. This application is misconceived in law. Firstly, there is no

statutory or public duty to refer the matter for arbitration. Secondly, the prayer is erroneous.

There is no specific prayer for a writ. In Dayananda v. Thalwatte [(2001) 2 Sri.L.R. 73] this Court

held that the failure to specify the writ renders the application bad in law.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner but without costs.
