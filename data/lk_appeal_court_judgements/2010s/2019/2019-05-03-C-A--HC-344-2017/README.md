1. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Matara for committing an offence of grave sexual abuse on Maradan

Sumithra Devi (Victim) who was under 16 years of age, punishable under

section 365b(2)b of the Penal Code.

2. After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant and was

sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, and also imposed a fine of Rs.

10,0001- in default of payment of the fine, imprisonment for 6 months.

Further the Appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 150,000/- as compensation to

the victim and a default sentence was imposed.

3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Appellant appealed against the

same on the following grounds;

2

1. The learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the vital omissions and

that contradictions VI, V3, and V4 marked by the defence.

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the

prosecution has not proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt.

4. We carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, judgment of the

learned Trial Judge, written submissions filed and the submissions made by

Counsel for both Appellant and Respondent at the hearing of the appeal.

5. Case for the prosecution mainly rests on the evidence of the alleged victim

who had been 10 years old at the time of the incident. Her evidence in a

nutshell was that they were living in line rooms. House of the Appellant also

had been in the same line. She had gone to the toilet that was outside. Her

father had been sleeping. From the toilet she had come to the tap to wash.

Then the Appellant had closed her mouth with a cloth and had dragged her

towards his kitchen. Appellant had been wearing a sarong. He had taken her

inside the kitchen made her lean against the wall and removed her trouser

and had kept his penis on to her vagina. She had said that he did it for about

1 hour.

6. Then the victim had gone and told her father and then the mother. Same day

they had reported the matter to Police.

Ground No.1

7. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned Trial Judge failed to

evaluate the vital contradictions and the ommissions in the evidence of the

main witness Sumithra Devi. When evaluating the evidence of the victim it

is pertinent to note that the victim was 10 years old when the alleged sexual

assault was committed on her. At the same time, it is also important to note

that she was 18 years old when she gave evidence in Court, which means 8

years after the offence was committed. Therefore, her evidence has to be

evaluated taking her age and the time passed in giving evidence into

consideration.

8. It was submitted by the Counsel for the Appellant that the victim had

omitted to mention to the Police in her statement that her mouth was covered

with a cloth. As mentioned before, when she went to the Police Station, she

was 10 years old. Obviously, she would have been more concerned about the

sexual act the Appellant performed on her. The learned Trial judge has

considered above omission carefully at page 14 of his judgment and

correctly had come to the conclusion that it had not affected the credibility

of the victim.

9. The contradiction marked as VI was whether she felt pain when the accused

committed the sexual act on her. In her statement to Police she had said that

she did not feel pain. The learned Trial Judge had given careful

consideration into VI as well. As the Learned Trial Judge mentioned in his

4

judgment at page 14, correctly explained as to how that answer became

inevitable.

10. There had been two questions put together, so even if she answered the first,

she was compelled to say that she felt pain. However, the contradiction VI

will not affect the credibility of the victim.

11. Contradictions V3 and V 4 are also the same. Those will not go to the root of

the case. All those contradictions were well considered by the learned Trial

Judge in his judgment. Contradiction marked V3 is from the evidence of the

mother of the victim Letchchami. Letchchami had said in evidence that her

two sons had gone to school. However, she had told the Police in her

statement that the two sons had gone to her father's house close by. That

contradiction marked from Letchchami' s evidence will not create a doubt on

the evidence of the victim that she was sexually assaulted.

12.Contradiction marked V4 is also from the evidence of Letchchami.

Letchchami had gone in search of the Manager of the estate to complain

5

about the incident. On the way back to the Police Station she had met

Kankani. The issue in cross examination was whether she told the incident to

kankani. She said that she told him but denied removing the child's trouser

and showing Kankani. This again was considered by the learned High Court

Judge at page 18 and 19 of his judgment and rightly concluded that it would

not affect the case for the prosecution.

13.As submitted by the Senior State Counsel for the Respondent, The Indian

Supreme Court in State of Uttar Pradesh V. MK Anthony [1984J SCJ 236/

[1985J CRl. LJ. 493 at 498/499 held;

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach

must be whether the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to

have ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly

necessary for the Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly

keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed

out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it

is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and

whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to tender it

unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking

sentences torn out of context here and there from evidence, attaching

importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit

rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the

witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about

the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate Court

6

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the

appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court and unless there are

reasons weightly and formidable it would not be proper to reject the

evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter

of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in

some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals. "

This was referred to and followed in case of Oliver Dayananda Kalansuriya

V. Republic of Sri Lanka CA 2812009 (13.02.2013).

14.The learned Trial Judge has carefully considered the above contradictions

and omissions in the evidence of witnesses for the prosecution and rightly

found that those would not go to the root of the case and would not affect the

case for the prosecution. Therefore, this ground of appeal has no merit.

Ground No.2

15.Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence of the victim was not

corroborated and that it is unsafe to convict the Appellant on uncorroborated

testimony of the victim.

16.Sexual offences on children are often committed in isolation and not in

public. Therefore, very seldom you find eye witnesses other than the victim.

If the evidence of the victim is credible, consistent and trustworthy, court is

entitled to convict an accused on the uncorroborated testimony of the

prosecutrix.

7

17.The victim in this case was a 10-year-old child when she was allegedly

sexually abused. Age of a victim is not determinative of her ability to give

truthful and accurate evidence, and, if found competent, it is open to the

Court to convict on the evidence of a single child witness, whatever her age.

(R. V. B. [201 OJ EWCA Crim 4; [2011J Crim. L.R. 233)

18.1ndian Supreme Court in case of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat

[1983J AIR SC 753 said;

"In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim

of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding

insult to the injury"

19.1n case of Thambarasa sabaratnam V. A.G. CA 12712012, after discussing a

series of cases said;

"Therefore, it is clear that an accused person facing a charge

of sexual offence can be convicted on the uncorroborated evidence of

the victim when her evidence is of such character as to convince the

Court that she is speaking the truth. "

20.ln the instant case the victim child promptly complained to her father about

the sexual assault committed by the Appellant and a complaint to the

Police was made the same day. Although the complaint being recent cannot

be considered as corroboration, it enhances the credibility of the victim

being consistent. The learned Trial Judge had evaluated the evidence

carefully of the prosecution and the defence to find that the victim is credible

8

and truthful. It is the Trial Judge who has the opportunity to observe the

demeanour and deportment of the witness. We see no reason to find that the

learned Trial Judge erred when he found that the prosecution had proved its

case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, ground of appeal No 2 will not

succeed.

21.In the above premise, we find that the appeal has no merit and we affirm the

conviction and the sentence of the learned Trial Judge.

Appeal is dismissed.
