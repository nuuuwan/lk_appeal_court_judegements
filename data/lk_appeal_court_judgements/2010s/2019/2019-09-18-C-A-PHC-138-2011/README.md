Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed against the Judgment of the High Court of

Hambantota affirming the order of the Magistrates Court of

Walasmulla made under section 68(3) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act whereby the 1st Respondent-Appellant was

ordered to remove the structure erected on the land in suit on

the basis that he has forcibly entered the land within two

months prior to the filing of the action.

The premises admittedly belong to the Walasmulla Mosque and

governed by a Board of Trustees.

The only substantive defence apart from technical objections

taken up by the Appellant before all three Courts is that, the

Appellant came into occupation of a part of the land about five

perches in extent out of nearly two acres of a larger land, with

the consent of the Board of Trustees of the Mosque.

This assertion is unacceptable as only two Members of the

Board in their private capacities have consented to it.1 The

1 Vide circled pages 94, 104 and 78 of the Brief. It seems only M.S.M. Wafeek and A.R.M. Jabeer have consented.

majority of at least six Members are against it.2 Hence it is clear

that the Appellant has gone into forcible occupation of the

property belonging to the Mosque.

There is no dispute that the Appellant did so within two months

immediately prior to the filing of the action.

The argument in this appeal was decided to be disposed of by

way of written submissions. Although the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Appellant has filed written submissions, no

written submissions have been filed by counsel for the

Petitioner-Respondent.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant has taken up a

number of technical objections to the maintainability of this

action.

I must emphasize that, given the intention of the legislature in

introducing this special piece of legislation, which is nothing but

to make provisional orders to prevent breach of the peace until

the matter is determined by a competent Court, there is no place

for high-flown technical objections in section 66 applications.

Having said so, let me summarily deal with the said technical

objections.

First one is that the application has been filed in the wrong

Court, that is, not in the Primary Court of Walasmulla, but in

the Magistrates Court of Walasmulla. There is no Primary

Court in Walasmulla and the Magistrate of Walasmulla exercises

the jurisdiction of the Primary Court as well, and as far as I

know, that authority to perform duties as the Primary Court

Judge is given on the Magistrate in the appointment letter itself.

The learned President Counsel has admitted that the impugned

order has been signed by the Magistrate as the Judge of the

Primary Court of Walasmulla.

The second one is that the petitioner has not averred locus

standi in the petition. The petitioner in paragraph 7 of the

petition has stated that he is a Member of the Board of Trustees

of the Mosque and has also tendered the complaint made to the

police by him as P2. In that complaint, he has described the

capacity on which he makes that complaint. Thereafter the

other Members of the Board have by way of an affidavit

consented the petitioner to proceed with the action on behalf of

the Board.3 Although that affidavit is dated subsequent to the

filing of the action, that is sufficient for the purpose of section 66

application.

The third one is that the supporting affidavit of the petitioner is

bad in law inasmuch as the petitioner being a Muslim has

deposed to the facts of the affidavit on oath but not on

affirmation. As was held by the Supreme Court in Sooriya

Enterprises (International) Limited v. Michael White & Company

Limited4 It is not imperative for non-Christians referred to in

section 5 of the Oaths Ordinance to make an affirmation in an

affidavit. The use of the word may in section 5 of the Oaths

Ordinance of 1895, instead of shall must be regarded as

deliberate; with the consequence that non-Christians who

believed in God would have the option to swear or to affirm. It

was further held in that case that the substitution of an oath for 3 Vide circled page 79 of the Brief. 4 [2002] 3 Sri LR 371

5

an affirmation (or vice versa) will not invalidate proceedings or

shut out evidence. The fundamental obligation of a witness or

deponent is to tell the truth (section 10), and the purpose of an

oath or affirmation is to reinforce that obligation. Vide also Inaya

v. Lanka Orix Leasing Company Ltd5, Trico Freighters (Pvt) Ltd v.

Yang Civil Engineering Lanka (Pvt) Ltd6, Kariyawasam v. Dona

Mercy7.

The fourth one is that there was no imminent threat to the

breach of the peace for the Magistrate to cloth with jurisdiction

to determine the matter. Breach of the peace does not amount

to physical fights, which may or may not lead to murder. If

there is a likelihood of a breach of the peace, that is sufficient.

The learned Magistrate before issuance of notice has satisfied

that there is a threat to the breach of the peace and so recorded.

This Court sitting in appeal cannot say that there was no breach

of the peace.

The fifth one is that the learned Magistrate has not taken steps

to amicably settle the dispute before fixing the matter for inquiry

to be disposed of on written submissions. The learned

Magistrate has postponed the matter specifically for settlement

and on the next date it has been recorded that there was no

settlement. In any event, the earlier view that unless the

Magistrate first takes steps to settle the matter, the Magistrate

lacks jurisdiction to decide the same, has now been decided to

be incorrect. Vide my Judgment in Kusumalatha v. Sriya

Swarnakanthi8.

I reject the said technical objections.

Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
