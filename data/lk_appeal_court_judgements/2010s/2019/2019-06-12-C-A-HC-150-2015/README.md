31.07.2018 by the Complainant-Respondent 02.02.2018 by the Accused-Appellant

11.06.2019

01. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Matara with one count of murder punishable under section 296 of the Penal

Code and one count of attempted murder punishable under section 300 of

the Penal Code. According to the particulars of the offences, it is alleged that

the Appellant committed the above offences with one Suduhakuruge

Gunapala who was deceased at the time of the trial.

02. After trial the learned High Court Judge found the Appellant guilty of both

counts and convicted accordingly. The Appellant was sentenced to death on

count No.OI, and on count No.02, was sentenced to 10 years rigorous

imprisonment and imposed a fine ofRs. 5000/-. Being aggrieved by the said

conviction, the Appellant preferred the instant appeal on the following

grounds as submitted in the written submissions.

1. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that the evidence of PWI

does not pass the test of reliability owing to its material inconsistencies

and per se contradictions.

2

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the absence of intention on

the part of the Accused-Appellant to commit murder and it was done on

the spur of the moment without any advance preparation or deliberation.

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the medical

evidence contradicts the evidence ofPWI.

03. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, Grounds of appeal, written and oral submissions

made by counsel for both parties at the argument of this appeal.

Case for the prosecution in brief

04. Main witness for the prosecution was PWI, M.D. Karunaratne. According to

PWI, on the date of the incident he had gone to meet a friend with his

brother (deceased) on a motor bike to Deegala. On their way, the Appellant

had blocked their way by putting a motor bike on to the middle of the road.

Appellant had been with his father Gunapala and one Sumanasiri. Gunapala

had held the handle of their bike and Appellant had stabbed the deceased on

his chest once. When the PWI tried to get down from the bike, the Appellant

had also stabbed him on the chest. Deceased brother had run and the

Appellant had followed him. PWI had run towards another direction. He had

gone to a house and had locked himself in. A man had then taken him to a

boutique through the jungle and a person known to him had taken him to the

hospital. Later, he had got to know that his brother had died.

Defence Case

05. Appellant made an unsworn statement from the dock. He denied killing the

deceased. He said that PWI lied in Court. There had been a previous

incident where another brother of PW 1 was killed and PWI had suspected

Appellant and Appellant's father for that murder. They were discharged by

Court. He said that the other suspect Sumanasiri had a dispute over some

money with PWI. As police were looking for them, they have surrendered.

He denied the allegation. Defence called two more witnesses to give

evidence.

Ground No. 01

06. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that, although PWI initially said that he

with his brother went to meet a friend, in cross examination he reluctantly

admitted that he accompanied the deceased for his security. Further it was

submitted that in further cross examination it was revealed that they went in

search of Gunapala, father of the Appellant.

07. The learned Trial Judge has carefully considered this aspect in pages 17, 18

and 19 (Pages 350-352 of the appeal brief) of his judgment. He has

sufficiently explained as to why he found the PWI a credible and truthful

witness. PWI was cross examined at length and the counsel for the

Appellant has put confusing questions to him. As the learned Trial Judge

rightly found in page 18 of his judgment, it is natural for a person to divert to

another place before going to the place he initially intended to go.

08. Contradictions inter se as well as per se should not be considered to discredit

a witness unless those are material that go to the root of the case. Indian

Supreme Court in State of Uttar Pradesh V. M.K Anthony [1984J SCJ 236/

[1985J CRI. LJ. 493 at 498/499 held;

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach

must be whether the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to

have ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly

necessary for the court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly

keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed

out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it

is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and

whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to tender it

unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking

sentences torn out of context here and there from evidence, attaching

importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit

rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the

witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about

the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the

appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless there are

reasons weightily and formidable it would not be proper to reject the

evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter

of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in

5

some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals. "

This was referred to and followed in case of Oliver Dayananda Kalansuriya

V. Republic of Sri Lanka CA 2812009 (13.02.2013).

09. In the instant case, as I mentioned before, cross examining the witness at

length and by confusing him, defence had tried to take undue advantage of

the answers given by PW 1 on his reason to travel to Appellant's area on the

day of the incident.

10. It is the Trial Judge who has the opportunity to observe the demeanour and

deportment of a witness. He is the best person to decide on the credibility

and the testimonial trustworthiness of a witness.

In case of Fradd V. Brown & company Ltd. (20 N.L.R. Page 282) Privy

Council held:

HIt is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit,

upon a point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal,

because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a

Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with

any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn from paper or

from narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in

question of veracity, so direct and so specific as these, a Court of

Appeal will over-rule a Judge of first instance'

The learned Trial Judge was the best person to decide on the credibility of

the PWI in this case.

11. Counsel for the Appellant citing case of Bhagwan Sahai V. State of

Rajastan (Criminal Appeal No. 416 of 2016) submitted that, as PWI has

suppressed the genesis and origin of the occurrence of crime, the Accused

Appellant is entitled to get the benefit of doubt. The facts in Bhagwan Sahai

are quite different to the facts of this case. In Bhagawan Sahai, prosecution

party had caused injuries to the Appellant's father causing his death. That

fact was not revealed by the prosecution. In the instant case there is no

evidence of such an incident, nor such suppression of facts were revealed.

As I said before, the learned Trial Judge has given good and sufficient

reasons for acting upon the evidence of PWI.

12. The learned Trial Judge has sufficiently considered the evidence ofPWI and

I find no reason to interfere with his finding that PWI was a reliable witness

whose evidence could be acted upon. Hence ground of appeal No.OI has no

merit.

Ground No.02

13. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Appellant was not aware of the

arrival of PWI and the deceased to their village. Therefore, it can be

concluded that the murder was not pre planned or done with intention. It has

happened on the spur of the moment. If the Appellant had the intention to

kill, he could have stabbed the deceased more and inflicted more injuries to

the deceased. It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that the

learned Trial Judge could have considered convicting him for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

",

14. It is pertinent to note that it was suggested to the PWI by the defence at the

trial, that it was Sumanasiri who stabbed the victims. Further, while denying

any involvement to the incident, in his dock statement the Appellant had said

that PWI had a dispute with Sumanasiri and that victims implicated them

because of the previous enmity.

15. There is no evidence of pre-planning for days to commit murder as

submitted by the Counsel for Appellant. However the evidence is that the

Appellant and his father blocked the road and Appellant stabbed the

deceased and PWI. There is no evidence of a sudden fight.

16. Although the deceased had only one stab injury other than the abrasions on

the face, shoulder, knee, and ankle, the stab injury had been on the chest. It

has pierced the heart. Therefore, it is clear that the intention was to cause

death of the deceased when he was stabbed on the chest piercing the heart.

The stab injury to PWI was also on his chest.

The intention to kill can be formed at any moment, not necessarily after pre-

planning. In the above premise, ground of appeal No. 02 should fail.

Ground No. 03

17. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that although PWI said that the incident

took place at about 5.30 pm, according to the doctor who conducted the post

mortem, the death has occurred around 5 pm.

18. As submitted by the counsel for the Respondents, the half an hour difference

will not create any doubt about the incident. Further, one cannot expect the

8

victim to look at the watch to see the exact time when he is being stabbed.

This argument of the counsel for Appellant is without substance.

19. Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that according to the doctor who

examined the PW1, he had stated that one Karunasena stabbed him. It is

submitted that Karunasena must be some other person.

20. On perusing the evidence of the doctor who examined the PW1, it is clear

that according to the doctor PWI had given the name of the person who

stabbed him as Kumarasena, not Karunasena. (page 223 of the appeal brief).

Name of the Appellant is Kumarasiri. PWI had mentioned to police and also

to court about Kumarasiri, the Appellant. It is obvious that the doctor had

made a mistake by taking the name down as Kumarasena, instead of

Kumarasiri. This ground of appeal also should necessarily fail.

Hence the conviction and sentence of the learned High Court Judge IS

affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J

I agree.
