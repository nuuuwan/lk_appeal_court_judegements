Plaintiff~ Respondent

T he Plaintiff~Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff"), the

owner of premises bearing No.45, Main Street, Thalathuoya, instituted action in

the District Court of Kandy on 08.10.1998 praying for the ejectment of the Defendant~

Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") who was a tenant on

1

the basis that the Defendant was guilty of conduct which amounted to a nuisance to

adjoining occupiers and had been using the premises for an immoral or illegal purpose

and that the condition of the premises had deteriorated owing to acts committed by or

the neglect or default of the Defendant. According to the Plaintiff, notwithstanding a

quit notice dated 29.08.1998 sent to the Defendant, the Defendant failed to handover

vacant possession.

Since the Defendant had made an application to the Rent Board seeking permission to

effect repairs to the building, the Plaintiff prayed for interim relief preventing the

Defendant from carrying out any repairs and the Court granted an enjoining order in

favour of the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff took out a commission to assess the extent of deterioration of the building

and the Defendant also requested an inspection of the premises in suit by an officer

appointed by court.

On 13.08.1999, the Defendant who was present in court and was represented by his

Attorney~at~Law agreed to accept a sum of Rs.50,000/~ from the Plaintiff as a full and

final settlement which sum the Plaintiff had already deposited in the District Court, and

further agreed to handover vacant possession to the Plaintiff on the given date. The

settlement was recorded and the case record was signed by the parties.

Barely two weeks after the said settlement had been entered into and recorded, the

Defendant filed a petition of appeal not signed by his Attomey~at~ Law and subsequently

filed another petition addressed to the District Court seeking to set aside the settlement

entered on the basis that he was forced to enter into the settlement which vitiated his

consensual agreement.

The learned District Judge by his order dated 29.08.2000 dismissed the application of the

Defendant on the basis that the Defendant had already preferred an appeal to the Court

of Appeal and notwithstanding such appeal made another application to the District

Court to vacate the decree incorporating the said settlement. By way of this appeal he

seeks an annulment of the compromise reached on 13th August 1999.

2

It was submitted by the learned President's Counsel that this settlement was reached

before Court where the Defendant and his Attorney~at~Law were both present and the

Defendant himself had signed the record. It is indeed the case that restitution does not lie

in favor of a party who has voluntarily agreed in Court and in fact Lameer v. Senaratane

(1995) 2 Sri L.R 13, held that:~

"The plaintif{petitioner instituted action for Declaration of title, ejectment and damages.

Defendant~respondent filed Answer stating that he was in lawful possession. After several dates of

trial, a settlement was recorded on 21.6.l991 that the Petitioner should sell the premises to the

respondents at Rs. 75,000 a perch. On 13.71991, the terms were recorded and signed by the parties.

An application was made to set aside the settlement, on the grounds that (i) the Attomey,at,Law

acted contrary to instructions; (2) he was compelled by Court to accept the terms. (3) Laesio

Enormis;( 4) Uncertainty of the settlement.

Held:

1. When an Attomey,at,Law is given a general Authority to settle or compromise a case, the

client cannot seek to set aside a settlement so entered, more so, when the client himself had

Signed the record.

2. There is no affidaVit from the Attomey,at' Law affirming that the petitioner was forced into

accepting the terms of settlement. Pleadings indicate that the settlement was first suggested

on 21.6.l991 and entered only on 13.7.l991.

3. Court cannot grant relief by way of restitution to a party who has agreed in Court, to sell

property at a lesser price with the full knowledge of its true value.

4. There is no uncertainty as, in this instance, the respondent has already depOSited the full sum

due."

In the instance case, although the Defendant contends that his consent was obtained by

duress, coercion and undue influence there is no evidence in support of this allegation.

There is no affidavit by his Attorney~at~Law affirming that the petitioner was forced into

accepting the terms of settlement. On the other hand, he himself signed the record and

3

subsequently filed this petition of appeal against the said settlement two weeks later. If

the Defendant had any misgivings about the proposed settlement, he could have very

well have refused to accept the terms recorded on 13.08.1999 which he has not done. In

Such a situation estoppel operates and the Defendant would be estopped from falsely

denying that he fully consented to the settlement that was entered into.

Moreover the Defendant has not been able to produce any proof documentary or

otherwise to show that he was placed under duress so as to be out of his voluntary

faculties not understand the proceedings that took place on 13.08.1999. The fact that he

subscribed to it by placing his signature shows that he understood the terms of the

settlement.

Section 114( d) of the Evidence Ordinance

Woodroffe, J. expressed a dictum in Navendra La] Khan v.jogi Hari, I.L.R. 32 Cal. 1107,

that, "The meaning of section 114 ( d) of the Evidence Ordinance is that if an official act is

proved to have been done, it will be presumed to have been regularly done. It does not

raise any presumption that an act was done, of which there is no evidence and the proof

of which is essential to the plaintiff's case". FollOwing this dictum of Woodroffe, J. in the

above case, Keuneman, J. in Dharmatilake v. Brampy Singho (1938) 40 N.L.R 497 at p.

501 held that, "Section 114 ( d) of the Evidence Ordinance means that if an official act is

proved to have been done, it will be presumed to have been regularly done. It does not

raise any presumption that an act was done, of which there is no evidence and the proof

of which is essential to a case".

Under Illustration (d), the Court may presume that judicial and official acts have been

regularly performed. The presumption applies to the regularity of the act and not to the

doing of the act. Dharmatileke v. Barampy Singho (1938) 40 N.L.R 497;

Hapuganoralage Menikhamy v. Pom menika (1978) 79 (II) N.L.R. 25 at 33.

Proceedings and Process of courts are examples~see Seebert Silva v. Aronona Silva

(1957) 60 N.L.R 272; Franciscu v. Perera (1934) 14 c.L.W. 7l. Cf; Hapuganoralage

Menikhamy v. Pom menika (supra); Dharmatileke v. Barampy Singho (supra).

The passage in the case of Seebert Silva v. Aronona Silva 60 N.LR page 272 repays

attention: "the court is entitled to presume the genuineness in terms of section 114 of the Evidence

Ordinance of the journal entries maintained under the Civil Procedure Code. The genuineness attached to

the journal entries and the rebuttable presumption arising from the same ate part and pared of our

procedural law that had been followed for at least over a century." For reference to journal entries

to draw this presumption also see decisions of this Court in CA 477/2000(F) CA minutes

of 12.09.2017; CA 765/2000 CA minutes of 30.05.2018.

In the instant case, Journal Entry No.17 clearly indicates that the settlement has been

read over and explained to the parties and the parties having understood the same have

placed their signatures on the record.

Therefore the Defendant is seeking to sustain in this Court an unsustainable assertion

that he did not consent to the settlement in the District Court. There is not even a

complaint made against the Attorney~at~Law who represented him for misleading him or

acting against his instructions or forcing him to enter into a settlement and also when

the Defendant does not dispute the settlement recorded or the journal entries which

clearly indicate that both parties were present and signed the record voluntarily.

There is another impediment that would stand in the way of the Defendant namely

No appeal would lie from a consent decree

As held in Marikkar v. Abdul Azeez65 N.LR 568, "No appeal lies where parties have agreed to

be bound by the order of the Judge sought to be appealed from.

Accordingly, in an action for a right of way, no appeal lies from an order given by Court in accordance

with an agreement recorded by the Court as follows:~"It is agreed that the parties will accept any order

made by me after an inspection"."

Thus this Court would be hamstrung by want of jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

There was also a submission made by the Defendant. The Defendant's position that he

was intending to retain a President's Counsel is irrelevant to the case at hand as pivotal

issue which has to be determined in the instant appeal is whether allegation made by the

5

Defendant that he did not consent to the settlement has been proved and if so whether it

could vitiate the settlement?

In the case of Charles Perera v. Shantha Gunasekara CA 201V200l, held that:,

"The main question that arose for determination in that case was whether a settlement entered in

the presence of an attorney,at,law of a party who was absent in court can assail the settlement on

the ground that he was not present in court at the time the attorney,at,law adjusted the matter.

His Lordship Gamini Amaratunga, Judge of the Court of Appeal (as he was then) held that the

attorney,at,law for the petitioners had acted within the authOrity granted to him by the proxy

and therefore the settlement cannot be assailed merely on the ground of the party not being present

in court at the time the compromise was recorded."

In this particular instance Registered Attorney'at, Law was present in Court and that

appearance constituted the appearance of the Defendant. Accordingly the Defendant's

contention that he was expecting to retain a President's Counsel has no relevance and

would be an irrelevant consideration if taken into account owning to the fact that the

Petitioner was represented by an Attorney,at,Law on the date on which the settlement

was entered.

It is manifest upon an examination of all these matters that the Defendant'Appellant

voluntarily entered into a consensual compromise on 13.08.1999 and it is preposterous for

him now to resile from this agreement. In the circumstances I proceed to dismiss this

appeal.
