Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Post of the Director of the Postgraduate Institute of

Archaeology has fallen vacant. Upon publication of notice in the

newspapers, several applicants including the Petitioner have

applied for the Post. As seen from P1, it is common ground that

the appointing authority is the 1st Respondent University Grants

Commission (UGC), which selects a suitable applicant from a panel

of three names recommended by the Board of Management of the

Post Graduate Institute of Archaeology. At the Meeting held on

01.04.2016, the Board of Management of the Post Graduate

Institute of Archaeology has selected by vote the following three

applicants in the presence of an observer nominated by the UGC.

1. Professor A.M.G. Adikari (the Petitioner) (10 votes)

2. Professor P.B. Manawala (7 votes)

3. Professor D.W.R.K. Somadeva (7 votes)

However the Petitioner who received the highest votes polled has

not been notified by the UGC whether or not he has been selected,

and, if not, why he was not selected to be appointed to fill the

vacancy.

3

Instead, firstly, an Acting Director1, and thereafter, another as the

competent authority2, has been appointed under the hand of the

2nd Respondent the Chairman of the UGC to cover the duties of

the Director. The UGC has also by letter marked P7 dated

27.05.2016 informed the Acting Director to re-advertise the Post

to select a suitable person.

However, in my view, contrary to the above, by letter marked P9

dated 13.09.2016, the UGC has informed the Acting Director that

the UGC has not made any decision on the suitability of the

candidates whose names were recommended by the Board of

Management of the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology. That

refers to the three names mentioned earlier with the Petitioner's

name on top.

The Petitioner filed this application by petition dated 12.10.2016,

amended by amended petition dated 21.11.2016 seeking to issue a

writ of certiorari to quash the decision to re-advertise the vacancy

in the Post of Director of the Post Graduate Institute of

Archaeology, and to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the UGC

and its Chairman "to consider" the number of votes received and

the rank order of the nominees recommended by the Board of

Management of the Post Graduate Institute of Archaeology in order

to select the nominee to fill the vacancy for the Post of Director of

the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology.

1 Vide P6. 2 Vide document marked C tendered with the motion of the Attorney at Law of the Petitioner dated 04.09.2017.

4

The 1st and 2nd Respondents, UGC and its Chairman, and the 5th

Respondent, University of Kelaniya, filed objections to this

application.

In these objections, the UGC admits that it did not so far inform

the Petitioner whether he was selected or not, since, by

19.04.2016, i.e. just a few days after three names including the

Petitioner was sent by the Board of Management of the Post

Graduate Institute of Archaeology to the UGC, the UGC received an

anonymous letter under the name of Dushana Virodee Peramuna

marked R1 on alleged financial frauds committed by the Petitioner

whilst he was functioning as the Director General of the Central

Cultural Fund, and accordingly, the UGC at its Meeting held on

29.04.2016 decided to defer consideration of the three names

recommended by the Board of Management of the Postgraduate

Institute of Archaeology.

After this decision was taken, according to the objections, the UGC

has by letter marked R2A dated 30.09.2016 inquired from the

Financial Crimes Investigations Division of the Police whether

there was such a complaint, and it has been replied by R2B dated

26.10.2016 that, upon a complaint being made to the FCID about

alleged financial frauds against several former officers of the

Central Cultural Fund including the Petitioner, investigations were

completed and the file was sent to the Attorney General for advice.

The Petitioner is not even a suspect in a case. Hence upon an

anonymous petition received by the UGC under the name of

"Dushana Virodee Peramuna", the UGC cannot defer consideration

of the three names recommended by the Board of Management of

5

the Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology to fill the vacancy and re-

advertise the Post. If the consideration is deferred as opposed to

rejection, I cannot understand why the UGC wants to re-advertise

the Post. That means, the UGC has decided not to consider the

Petitioner's name to fill that Post without any basis.

The UGC in its objections has also stated that the Petitioner has no

legal right to be appointed to the Post of Director of the

Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology as the UGC has the

discretion to select any of the three candidates whose names have

been submitted. In the first place, the Petitioner does not seek to

compel the UGC to appoint him as the Director but to consider to

appoint him as the Director as the candidate who secured highest

polls.

On the other hand, the UGC has no absolute discretion to appoint

any one of the three candidates as they please. In modern

administrative law there is no unfettered unreviewable discretion.

The discretion shall be exercised rationally with sound time-tested

principles. In the exercise of discretion, the person in authority

shall not do what he likes but what he ought.

In Gunathileka v. Weerasena [2000] 2 Sri LR 1 at 6-7, J.A.N. de

Silva J. (later C.J.) stated:

It is observed that in Modern Administrative Law the concept

of absolute discretion is unacceptable. Parliament constantly

confers upon Public Authorities, powers which on their face

might seem absolute and arbitrary. But arbitrary power and

unfettered discretion are what Courts refuse to countenance.

They have woven a network of restriction principles which

6

require statutory powers to be exercised reasonably and in

good faith for proper purpose only. Administrative Law - 7th

Edition - Wade at page 379.

Justice Dougles in his dissenting judgment in U.S. vs.

Wundarlich (1951) 342 US 98 observed,

Law has reached its finest moments when it has freed man

from unlimited discretion of some ruler, some civil or military

official, some bureaucrats. Where discretion is absolute man

has always suffered. At times it has been his property that

has been invaded; at times his privacy; at times his liberty of

movement; at times his freedom of thought; at times his life;

absolute discretion is a ruthless master.

These Principles have been explained and elaborated in a

series of English decisions over a long period of time. Lord

Wrenbury in Roberts vs. Hopwood (1925) AC 578 at 613

stated that,

A person who is vested with a discretion must exercise his

discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not

empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is

minded to do so. He must in the exercise of his discretion do

not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must

by the use of reason, ascertain and follow the course which

reason directs. He must act reasonably.

When this case came up for the first time before me, counsel for

both parties agreed to dispose of argument by way of written

submissions, for counsel for the Petitioner first to file written

submissions for counsel for the Respondents to reply. The written

7

submissions of the Petitioner have been filed as far back as on

06.08.2018 with notice both to the UGC and the Attorney General

but those of the Respondents have not been tendered

notwithstanding several dates were given for that purpose.

Peoples legitimate rights cannot be denied on anonymous

petitions. I quash by way of certiorari the decision of the UGC to

re-advertise the vacancy for the Post of the Director of the

Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology, and direct the UGC and its

Chairman by writ of mandamus first to consider the three

nominees including the Petitioner recommended by the Board of

Management of the Post Graduate Institute of Archaeology to fill

the said vacancy.

Application of the petitioner is allowed with costs recoverable from

the 1st Respondent UGC.
