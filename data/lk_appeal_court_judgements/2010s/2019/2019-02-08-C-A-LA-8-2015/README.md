Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Samayawardhena, J.

The respondent-appellant (appellant) has filed this appeal with

leave obtained from a former bench against the Judgment of the

Board of Quazis dated 19.09.2015 by which the maintenance order

made against the appellant father by the Quazi in respect of three

children was affirmed.

As seen from the petition of appeal filed before the Board of

Quazis,1 the complaint of the appellant against the maintenance

order was that no proper inquiry was held by the Quazi before

making the said order. This contention has been rejected by the

Board of Quazis.

The applicant-respondent-mother (respondent) has asked as

maintenance, per mensem, Rs. 79,000/= for the daughter who was

at that time 18 years old and studying at the Royal Institute for a

Degree Programme, Rs. 50,000/= each to the two sons who were at

that time 15 and 10 years old and studying at the Royal College.2

The appellant in reply has stated that he could pay only

Rs.15,000/= to all three children. Then the Quazi has informed

both parties to produce proof regarding expenses and income, and

postponed the inquiry for 20.04.2013.3

At the inquiry on 20.04.2013, the respondent has handed over an

affidavit to Court with all her claims and other proof on husbands

income/expenditure etc. This has been recorded in front of the

appellant as seen from the signature of the appellant appearing on

that day proceedings.4 The respondents affidavit is found at pages

1 Vide pages 7-9 of X. 2 Vide page 70 of X. 3 ibid. 4 Ibid.

73-76 of X, and the other proof on husbands income/expenditure

are found at pages 77-101 of Xall bearing the 20.04.2013 date

stamp of the Quazi Court. Hence the complaint of the appellant

that he does not know how those documents found their way to

the case record is unfounded.

The appellant, although the Quazi requested the other day, did not

produce any document at the inquiry to prove his income,

expenses etc., but made under oath a bear statement that he was

willing to pay only Rs. 20,000/= to all three children as he has no

assets whatsoever.5 In that statement he has stated that when

they were living as a family he has been paying all school fees, van

fees, tuition fees, medicinal and all other maintenance of the three

children. That means, he understands the expenses of the

children. It is important to note that in his statement/evidence he

does not say that the childrens expenses are false or exaggerated.

Thereafter after going through all the documents6, the Quazi has

ordered the appellant to pay Rs. 25,000/= to the daughter, Rs.

30,000/= to the elder son, and Rs. 25,000/= to the younger son.

The complaint of the appellant now before this Court is that he

was not aware of the documents said to have been tendered with

the affidavit and therefore the inquiry was not conducted properly.

This complaint is unacceptable because as I stated earlier, as seen

from the proceedings before the Quazi, everything has happened in

front of the appellant.

In any event, it is not the complaint of the appellant before this

Court that they are forged documents. They are innocent

documents, mostly bank documents, to show the appellants

financial capacity/stability.

The inquiry before the Quazi may not have been conducted in a

manner which ideally it should have been done, but, as the Board

of Quazis has observed The learned Quazi has conducted the

inquiry in a satisfactory manner given the limited resources

available in the Quazi system in Sri Lanka.

I see no compelling reason to interfere with the Judgment of the

Board of Quazis.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
