Decided on: 02.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application against the Commissioner

General of Lands, the Divisional Secretary and his elder brother

as the 1st-3rd respondents respectively, seeking to quash by way

of writ of certiorari the decisions P11 and P12 of the 1st and 2nd

respondents nominating the 3rd respondent as successor to the

Grants P4 and P5; and to compel the 1st and 2nd respondents by

way of writ of mandamus to appoint the petitioner as the grantee

in succession as per P8 and P9.

The facts led to the filing of this application are as follows: The

petitioners and the 3rd respondents father was issued with the

Permit P2 under the Land Development Ordinance, No.19 of

1935, as amended. The father nominated his eldest son, the 3rd

respondent, as the successor. After the death of the father, the

mother was issued with two Grants P4 and P5 in respect of the

same land in terms of section 19(4) read with section 19(6) of the

3

Land Development Ordinance. The mother by P8 and P9

nominated the petitioner as the successor. Upon the death of

the mother, the eldest son who was nominated by the father in

the Permit as the successor informed the 1st and 2nd

respondents that he is the lawful successor to the land. This

was upheld by the 1st and 2nd respondents. It is this decision of

the 1st and 2nd respondents, which is being canvassed in this

writ application.

The learned counsel for petitioner concedes that upon the death

of a permit-holder, the spouse of that permit-holder

automatically becomes entitled to succeed to the land by

operation of law.

Section 48A(1) of the Land Development Ordinance reads as

follows:

Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or

her death was required to pay any annual instalments by

virtue of the provisions of subsection (2) of section 19,

notwithstanding default in the payment of such

instalments, the spouse of that permit-holder, whether he or

she has or has not been nominated as successor by that

permit-holder, shall be entitled to succeed to the land

alienated to that permit-holder on the permit and the terms

and conditions of that permit shall be applicable to that

spouse.

The pivotal argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is

that, after the death of the father, the mother who is entitled in

law to succeed and the 3rd respondent being the nominated

successor of the Permit, failed to take steps to succeed to the

4

land under section 84, and therefore the land in question

deemed to have been surrendered to the State under section 85,

and it is on that basis fresh Grants P4 and P5, which should be

considered as a fresh transaction between the State and the

mother, were issued in the name of the mother, who nominated

the petitioner as the successor. Hence the learned counsel

submits that the petitioner is the lawful successor.

I regret my inability to agree with that submission. Grants P4

and P5 did not constitute a fresh transaction between the State

and the mother. It is the continuation of the same old

transaction with the father as a permit-holder.

The petitioner cannot state that the mother who was entitled to

succeed to the land did not succeed to the land upon the death

of her husband. There is no evidence to that effect. If the

mother did not succeed to the land, as I will explain later, Grant

could not have been issued under section 19(4) of the Land

Development Ordinance.

On the other hand, as I will explain later, in terms of section

48A(2)(c), the nominated successor in the Permit could not have

succeeded to the land until the death of the Grantee (the

mother).

Then section 48A(2) reads as follows:

If, during the lifetime of the spouse of a deceased permit-

holder who has succeeded under subsection (1) to the land

alienated on the permit, the terms and conditions of the

permit are complied with by such spouse, such spouse shall

be entitled to a grant of that land subject to the following

conditions:-

5

a) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of the

land alienated by the grant;

b) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a

successor to that land;

c) upon the death of such spouse, or upon his or her

marriage, the person, who was nominated as

successor by the deceased permit-holder or who

would have been entitled to succeed as his

successor, shall succeed to that land:

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a

grant of any land to be made to a spouse who has been

nominated by the deceased permit-holder to succeed to the

land alienated on the permit.

It is common ground that the deceased permit-holder, the

father, did not nominate the mother as the successor.

Then section 48A(3) reads as follows:

Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in

contravention of the provisions of subsection (2) shall be

invalid.

There is no administrative fault in issuing Grants in the name of

the mother as stated by the 1st respondent in P11 on the

(incorrect) advice of the Attorney General. Those Grants have

been issued, as stated on the Grants themselves, in terms of

section 19(4) read with 19(6) of the Land Development

Ordinance. This has also to be read and understood with

section 48A(2) of the Land Development Ordinance which I

quoted above.

6

Section 19(4) reads as follows:

A permit-holder shall be issued a grant in respect of the

land of which he is in occupation

a) where he has paid all sums which he is required to

pay under subsection (2);

b) where he has complied with all the other conditions

specified in the Schedule to the permit; and

c) where he has been in occupation of, and fully

developed, to the satisfaction of the Government

Agent

i. irrigated land, for a period of three years, or

ii. high land, for a period of one year:

Provided, however, that the Land

Commissioner may issue a grant before the

expiry of the aforesaid period where the permit-

holder satisfies him that the failure to issue

such grant before the expiry of such period

would adversely affect the development of

such land.

Section 19(6) reads as follows:

Every grant issued under subsection (4) shall contain the

conditions that the owner of the holding shall not

a) dispose of a divided portion, or an undivided share of

the holding which is less in extent than the unit of the

sub-division or the minimum fraction specified in the

grant; and

b) dispose of such holding except with the prior

approval of the Government Agent.

7

For the aforesaid reasons, the 3rd respondent shall succeed to

the land.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed without costs.
