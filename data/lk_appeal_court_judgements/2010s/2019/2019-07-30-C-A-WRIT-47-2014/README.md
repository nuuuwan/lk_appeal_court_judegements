Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this writ application, the petition of which is

running into 26 pages, naming 20 Respondents, seeking the

following, in my view, vague and unspecific reliefs.

a. Issue notice on the Respondents

b. Direct the 1st to the 14th Respondents to make available to

court at the earliest possible opportunity the impugned

recommendations of the 5th Respondent abovenamed

c. Grant the Petitioner abovenamed permission to reserve her

right to seek interim relief as per the plea contained in the

foregoing paragraph 24.1(a)

d. Issue mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari in order

to quash the alleged or purported recommendations of the

5th Respondent referred to in the aforesaid pleadings (as

per the letter of 6th Respondent dated 2011.08.03 pleaded

by the Petitioner as P11)

e. Issue mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari in order

to quash any findings arrived at or any decision made by

the Respondents 1st to 14th relating to the entitlement of any

party (or in particular the 15th Respondent abovenamed) to

succeed to the rights pertaining to the corpus or any part

thereof, on the basis of the permit that was enjoyed by the

late H.H. Salpinona

f. Also issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to

quash all other decisions made by the 1st to the 14th

Respondents in relation to the granting of permits and/or

alienation of lands in connection with the corpus

3

g. Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition in

order to restrain the 1st to the 14th Respondents from

granting of permits and/or alienation of lands in connection

with the corpus aforesaid

h. Issue a writ of mandamus on the 1st Respondent

abovenamed directing him to conduct an appropriate

inquiry into the scratching off/obliteration of the Petitioners

name from the Land Ledger a copy of which is pleaded as

P5

i. The 1st Respondent be directed by way of a writ of

mandamus to grant the Petitioner the rights that would

accrue to her on the basis of the permit previously held by

her mother the late H.H. Salpinona by granting her a permit

in terms of the LDO

j. Direct the 2nd to the 14th Respondents to make available to

court the Land Ledger which deals with the corpus.

k. Grant costs and

l. Other and further relief

By going through the said reliefs, it appears to me that the main

relief which the Petitioner seeks is to quash some

recommendations made by the 5th Respondent Divisional

Secretary of Balapitiya alleged to have been made to the

Petitions Committee of the Southern Provincial Council.

In the first place, as a general rule, recommendations are not

amenable to writ jurisdiction as they have no force of law. What

is amenable to writ jurisdiction is the decision made on the

alleged recommendations. There is no specific decision which

the Petitioner has invited the Court to quash. The Petitioner in

4

the prayer to the petition makes a general statement seeking the

Court to quash by way of writ of certiorari any decision made by

the 1st-14th Respondents in relation to alienation of land which

is the subject matter in this application and morefully described

in the schedule to the petition. The 1st-14th Respondents

include the Commissioner General of Lands, the Provincial Land

Commissioner in the Southern Province, the District Secretary of

Galle, the Divisional Secretary of Balapitiya, the Secretary to the

Southern Provincial Council, the Surveyor General, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, the Grama

Niladhari of Watugedara.

This Court cannot issue writs in such vague terms against an

array of Government officials. This application, filed seeking

vague reliefs, shall, in my view, be dismissed in limine on that

basis.

Be that as it may, let me now understand the grievance of the

Petitioner as set out in the petition. The petition running into

26 pages is prolix. The Petitioners mother, namely Salpinona,

has been issued with the Permit dated 26.06.1967 marked P2

under the Land Development Ordinance regarding a land

described therein in extent of 1 Acre and 1 Rood. According to

P2, no successor has been nominated by Salpinona. That

portion relevant to nomination, which is at the end of P2, is still

blank.

However, the Petitioner, who is one of the children of

Salpinonaa daughterheavily relying on P5 states that she had

been nominated as the successor to the land by her mother, but

5

it has later been deleted for unknown reasons without following

the procedure set out in the Land Development Ordinance.

P5 is a photocopy of a Land Ledger. It is neither the original nor

a certified copy of the original. It is a True Copy certified at least

not by an Attorney-at-Law but by the husband of the Petitioner.

This a blatant violation of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990.

Be that as it may, the Petitioner who challenges the deletion of

her name as the nominated successor in P5 on the basis that no

proper procedure has been followed, in the first place, shall

explain how her name came to the Land Ledger as the

nominated successor of her mother, Salpinona. It is not clear,

who made that entry and when it was made. P5 is in relation to

a Permit No. 2645 dated 10.01.1947 issued in the name of

Salpinona. But P2 Permit in the name of Salpinona is dated

26.06.1967.

The said deleted endorsement in P5 under Nominated

Successor, which, according to the Petitioner, is in favour of

her, reads as follows: S. Danawathie, Daughter, 12 yrs.

According to the caption, the Petitioners name is Sipkaduwa

Anthony Dhanawathie Wimalasuriya alias S.A. Dhanawathie.

According to her National Identity Card number mentioned in

the proxy, the Petitioner was born in 1942. Salpinona could

have nominated the Petitioner as her nominated successor on or

after 26.06.1967 because Permit P2 issued in favour of

Salpinona is dated 26.06.1967. If we are to assume nomination

in P5 was made on 26.06.1967, the Petitioners age at that time

6

should have been 25 years and definitely not 12 years. If we are

to assume nomination in P5 was made on or around

10.01.1947, the date of the Permit mentioned in P5, the

Petitioner would have been only 5 years old at that time and not

12 years. The mother cannot make such blatant mistakes

regarding the age of her child.

Hence this Court cannot accept with certainty that it is the

Petitioner who has been nominated by Salpinona as her

successor to the land.

In that backdrop even though it is not necessary to explain in

detail how nomination can be effected under the Land

Development Ordinance, let me say the following.

Under section 56, the nomination of a successor shall be

effected by a document substantially in the prescribed form

executed and witnessed in triplicate before a Government Agent,

or a Registrar of Lands, or a Divisional Assistant Government

Agent, or a Notary, or a Justice of the Peace if the nomination is

not done on the Permit itself as stated in section 87.

The Petitioner, who speaks of failure to follow the provisions of

the Land Development Ordinance for cancellation of a

nomination, has, in the first place, not proved nomination as

above. Nomination of the Petitioner has not been done on the

Permit. Nor has it been done in the prescribed form in triplicate

either.

7

I take the view that the Petitioner has not proved that she was

the nominated successor to the land to the satisfaction of the

Court. Hence the Petitioner cannot succeed in this application.

It is the position of the 5th Respondent Divisional Secretary of

Balapitiya that, at the request of the Permit-holder Salpinona,

three new Permits bearing numbers 54920, 54921 and 54922

were issued, each in extent of 1 Rood, in the name of three of

Salpinonas daughters including the Petitioner; and in respect of

the balance portion of the land the eldest son succeeded in

terms of Rule 1 of the Third Schedule read with section 72 of the

Land Development Ordinance, and he (the eldest son) requested

the balance portion to be divided among remaining six children

of Salpinona. Those new Permits have been issued more than

15 years before filing of this application.

There is no necessity to scrutinize those assertions as the

burden is on the Petitioner to prove that he is entitled to the

reliefs she seeks from Court.

The Petitioner in the written submissions drawing attention of

Court to The Superintendent, Stafford State v. Solaimuthu Rasu

[2013] 1 Sri LR 25 says that the Respondent officials of the

Southern Provincial Council who have made these orders have

acted ultra vires. Who are the alleged specific Respondents of

the Southern Provincial Council the Petitioner is complaining

against? What are the specific Orders they have made? This

belated submission is unclear and unspecific.

Let me add the following on that matter. The Petitioner and her

husband have invited the Southern Provincial Council to

8

intervene in this matter, and thereafter, it seems that the

Southern Provincial Council has referred the matter to the Land

Commissioner and the Divisional Secretary. I do not think that

there is any order made by the Provincial Council which the

Petitioner seeks to challenge in these proceedings. Having

sought some redress from the Provincial Council on her own, it

cannot now lie in the mouth of the Petitioner to say that the

Provincial Council had no authority to deal with the matter. The

Petitioner must understand that writ is a discretionary remedy

and the conduct of the Petitioner is a relevant factor in deciding

the case.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
