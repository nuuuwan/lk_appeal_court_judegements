Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application for restitutio in integrum

against the respondent under Article 138(1) of the Constitution

seeking to set aside the Judgment of the Commercial High Court

dated 01.09.2003 and a declaration that the auction sale held

thereon is void.

Commercial High Court was set up by High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996.

According section 5 of that Act, against the Judgments and

Orders of the Commercial High Court, there is only one direct

appeal to the Supreme Court. Section 5(1) and (2) of that Act

reads as follows:

5(1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgement

pronounced by a High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

section 2, in any action, proceeding or matter to which such

person is a party may prefer an appeal to the Supreme

Court against such judgement, for any error in fact or in

law.

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by

a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section

2 in the course of any action, proceeding or matter to which

such person is, or seeks to be, a party, may prefer an

appeal to the supreme Court against such Order for the

3

correction of any error in fact or in law, with the leave of the

Supreme Court first had and obtained.

This Court has no appellate jurisdiction to set aside Judgments

or Orders of the Commercial High Court by way of final appeal,

revision or restitutio in intergrum. That is vested exclusively in

the Supreme Court.

This has been emphasized in a series of cases including

Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka v. Jatila Punyasiri Wijayawardena,

SC Appeal 81/2010, decided on 15.02.2012, Australanka

Exporters (Pvt) Limited v. Indian Bank [2001] 2 Sri LR 156,

Senanayake v. Koehn [2002] 3 Sri LR 381, Kosala Bandara

Bakmeewewa v. The Finance PLC, CA (PHC) APN 97/2007

decided on 13.06.2016.

It is significant to note that Article 138(1) of the Constitution

does not confer unrestricted, unfettered, absolute power for

revision and restitutio in integrum on the Court of Appeal against

Judgments and Orders of the High Courts. That Article reads:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

which shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise

of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any court of

First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and

restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court,

4

Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may

have taken cognizance:

Any law underlined above encompasses the Laws introduced

by Act No. 10 of 1996.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
