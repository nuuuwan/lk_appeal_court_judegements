Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this partition action in the District Court of Mt.

Lavinia by plaint dated 25.03.1991 naming 32 parties as Defendants

seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint

among the Plaintiff and the 1st-10th Defendants in the manner set out

in paragraph 25 to the plaint, and to leave the remining portion of the

land unallotted, as he was unaware of the rightful owners to the said

portion of the land. After trial, the learned District Judge delivered

the Judgment on 08.12.1997. The Petitioner has filed this application

for revision and/or restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside this

Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree entered thereon on the basis

that he was unaware of the case until the Court Commissioner came

to the land to prepare the final scheme of partition.

3

Upon Interlocutory Decree being entered in terms of the Judgment,

the learned District Judge issued the commission to the Court

Commissioner to prepare the final scheme of partition. Accordingly,

when the Court Commissioner went to the land on 29.02.2000 to

carry out his statutory duty inter alia under section 31 of the Partition

Law, several persons including the Petitioner to this application has

objected to it.1 Thereafter, they, including the Petitioner, have been

dealt with for contempt of Court, and the contempt inquiry has been

concluded on 21.07.2000.2

However, the Petitioner made this application seeking to set aside the

Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree, and add him as a party to the

case in order for him to file a statement of claim and contest the case,

on 20.06.2001 as seen from the date stamp on the original petition

dated 16.06.2001. That means, even assuming that he was unaware of

this case, at least, by 29.02.2000, he, without doubt, knew about this

case; but, did not think it fit to immediately make this application to

Court to minimize the damage which would cause to others by

making a belated application. If I may summarize, he made this

application 10 years after the filing of the case, 3 years after the

Judgment, and 1 year and 4 months after he admittedly knew about

the case. This delay, which has not been explained to the satisfaction

of the Court, in my view, is unreasonable, in the facts and

circumstances of this case. It is trite law that a party seeking a

1 Vide paragraph 4 of the Petition of the Petitioner dated 16.06.2001 and JE No.77 dated 26.06.2000. 2 Vide JE No.95 dated 21.07.2000.

discretionary remedy such as revision or restitutio in integrum shall come

to Court without delay, for otherwise, the application is liable to

dismissed in limine without going into the merits.

For completeness, let me now have a look at the merits of the

Petitioners application in brief.

He claims 7 perches of the corpus by Deed marked P8 dated

09.09.1989. The Plaintiff states that this Deed has not been registered

in the Folio or any other connected Folio where the lis pendens in this

case has been registered.

The Petitioner has not elaborated the devolution of his title for this

Court to understand his entitlement to the land. He has not, at least,

produced a copy of the Deed of his vendor which is referred to in his

Deed P8.

Nor has he satisfied the Court by way of superimposition, or by

referring to a particular lot in the Preliminary Plan or the proposed

Final Plan, that the land described in Deed P8 falls within the corpus.

In short, by looking at P8 this Court cannot say that the Petitioner is a

co-owner of this land.

Although section 48(3) of the Partition Law empowers this Court to

vary the partition Judgment of the District Court in the exercise of

revisionary and/or restitutio in integrum jurisdiction, this Court cannot

exercise that jurisdiction carelessly or irresponsibly, unless it is fully

5

satisfied that a grave miscarriage of justice has occurred due to no

fault of the Petitioner.

For the aforesaid reasons, I am not inclined to grant reliefs sought for

by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has, if so advised, two options: to make an application

to the District Court in order to secure his alleged entitlement from

the portion left unallotted in the Judgment3; or, to file an action under

section 49 of the Partition Law for damages.4

Application of the Petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
