The Petit ioner has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the 1st Respondent, Inspector General of Police to

dismiss the Petitioner from the Police Department and the subsequent

decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which upheld the decision of

the 1st Respondent as well as the National Police Commission.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

By letter dated 6th June 2008 annexed to the petition marked 'Pi', the

Petitioner had been appointed as a Sub Inspector of Police with effect from

20th April 2008. In terms of paragraph 2 of 'Pi' the period of probation shall be

three years. Having completed his period of training, the Petitioner had initially

been assigned to the Padukka Police Station. Thereafter, he had been posted

to the Athurugiriya Police Station. While serving at the Athurugiriya Police

Station, the Petitioner had been granted leave every Saturday to follow a

Diploma programme in Criminology at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura.

At some point of time, the Petitioner had been posted to the Mulleriyawa

Police Station.

While serving at the Mulleriyawa Police Station, a complaint had been made by

one Sampath Karunaratne on 30th October 2010 that the Petitioner was having

an illicit relationship with his wife and that he and his friends had found the

Petitioner in his house that day and that they have 'detained' the Petitioner.

Following inquiries, t he Athurugiriya Police had found the Petitioner at the

house of the complainant, tied to a post. Investigations carried out by the

Police Department revealed that the Petitioner had made an entry in the

Information Book at the Mulleriyawa Police Station that he was leaving the

Station to attend lectures at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura. However,

inquiries have revealed that, instead the Petitioner had visited the wife of the

complainant.

Having conducted a preliminary investigation into this matter, the Police

Department had issued t he Petitioner a charge sheet dated 14th February

3

2011, annexed to the petition marked 'PIS'. This Court has examined 'PIS' and ----

finds that all seven charges are based on the Petitioner having made a false

entry in the Information Book and thereafter having engaged in an illicit

relationship with the wife of the complainant, as well as having taken a sum of

Rs. 50,000 from her, thereby violating different sections of the disciplinary

code applicable to the Petitioner and thereby bringing the Police Service to

disrepute. After an inquiry, where the Petitioner was defended by a retired

Police officer and was afforded an opportunity of giving evidence on his behalf,

the Inquiry Officer had found the Petitioner 'guilty' of all charges leveled

against the Petitioner.!

Although the Inquiry Officer had only recommended, by way of punishment,

the suspension of salary increments and promotions due to the Petitioner, the

Senior Deputy Inspector General in charge of the Petitioner had recommended

that the services of the Petitioner be terminated as provided for in Section

24:3:2 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code, as the Petitioner was still

under probation at the time the aforementioned incident occurred.2 This Court

has examined the said provision of the Establishments Code and finds that the

said recommendation is in terms of the Establishments Code.3 The Inspector

General of Police had agreed with the said recommendation and by a

Disciplinary Order annexed to the petition marked 'PIS' terminated the

services of the Petitioner.

1 The report of the Inquiry Officer has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P16'.

2 The recommendation has been annexed to the petition marked 'P17'.

3 Section 24.3.2 relates to the termination of service of an officer serving a period of probation.

4

Being aggrieved by 'PIS', the Petitioner had appealed to the National Police

Commission which had dismissed his appeal.4 The Petitioner had thereafter

appealed against the decision of the National Police Commission to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which too, by its order 'P21' had dismissed

the appeal of the Petitioner subject to exonerating the Petitioner of charge No.

2, on a procedural irregularity. This application has been filed seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash 'PIS' and 'P21'.

The submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner were twofold. His

first submission was that although the charge sheet contained seven charges,

the Inquiry Officer has found the Petitioner 'guilty' of only three charges. He

submitted however that the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police, the

Inspector General of Police, the National Police Commission and the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal have all proceeded on the basis that the

Petitioner had been found guilty of all seven charges. This, he submitted, was

an error on the face of the record and vitiated their finding.

As observed above, all seven charges in 'PIS' are based on the Petitioner

having made a fa lse ent ry in the Information Book and thereafter having

engaged in an illicit relationship. Charge Nos. 1 - 3 are titled as follows:

Charge 1 -'etOtffiOBl~1Il) ~',

Charge 2 -'q0X) qfi)lIllCt~ em 8e.)JIIl)J(3 ~@C:l em;S5@' and

Charge 3 -'q0X) qfi)lIllCtE>'.

4 The decision of the National Police Commission has been annexed to the petition marked 'P20'.

5

The Inquiry Officer has dealt with Charge Nos. 1, 2 and 3 under the heading

'qo6\O~ 3@Q e1)l;SB@>' and found the Petitioner 'guilty' of the said charges.

Similarly, Charge No. 4 on 'P1S' is titled '3Q)JO~S em Cf~051ll ~) CllC) tre' and

the Inquiry Officer has dealt with this Charge as 'Charge 2' under the same title

'(!Q)JO~S em Cf~051ll ~) CllC) 6a'. Charge Nos. 5,6 and 7 are titled '~$tl) @all',

'~$tl) @all' and 'CfBlS e1)l;SB@>' respectively, and the Inquiry Officer has dealt with

these charges under the heading 'CfBlS eD~S<3'. Thus, the Inquiry Officer has in

fact found the Petitioner 'guilty' of all charges, but has grouped the charges

under three heads in his conclusion. Having considered the report of the

Inquiry Officer marked 'P16', it is clear to this Court that the Inquiry Officer was

satisfied that the core offence -i.e. making a fa lse entry and engaging in

conduct unbecoming of a Police officer - which was common to all charges,

had been established.s Although the Inquiry Officer was required to record his

conclusions on each charge separately, no prejudice has been caused to the

Petitioner by the course of action adopted by the Inquiry Officer in lumping

together charges of a similar nature. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal too

has proceeded on the basis that the Petitioner has been found guilty of the

principal allegation made against him. In these circumstances, this Court does

not see any merit wit h the submission of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner.

The second submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Police Departmental Ru les require an Officer on probation to be treated

leniently. It does not appear from an examination of the report of the Inquiry

Officer marked 'P16' that the Petitioner raised this argument before the

Inquiry Officer, or for that matter, before the National Police Commission

5 Page 9 of the report marked 'P16',

6

and/or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Be that as it may, this Court has

considered the reports of the Inquiry Officer, the Senior Deputy Inspector

General and the Inspector General of Police, and it is clear that they have all

taken serious note of the conduct of the Petitioner. Given the nature of the

charges leveled against the Petitioner, this Court is in agreement with the

following conclusion reached by the Inspector General of Police in 'P18':

"06 (!)Q) e&s ~ roe!) @~ e>= ex;,CKJ @c.:lJe) ~)cl <;~oJOQ)~e\l~Q); Cll~

ru<;c.:leIl c)e~ <;~rn ~ffic.:lC) 00 C!>Ce\le!)Cl\ ele!) (f0l0, <;el~ BJ@f.:l~

e!)telQ) <;~c.:S S61ge (f<;e!)&l)rn BJ@OJeleDCl ~ eltC~ ~el~ooc.:lCll <;e."

This Court must also note that the decision of the Inspector General of Police is

within the powers vested in him by Section 24:3:2 of Chapter XLVIII of the

Establishment Code, and therefore the said decision is not ultra vires the

powers conferred on the Inspector General of Police. This Court is also of the

view that the Petitioner has not been dealt with in an inappropriately harsh

manner. In these circumstances, this Court cannot agree with the second

submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

There is one other matter that this Court must advert to. Our Courts have

consistently held that a person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of this

Court must do so without delay and that any delay must be explained. The

decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had been delivered on 11th

December 2017, whereas this application has been filed in June 2019. The

Petitioner states in an affidavit annexed to the petition marked 'P23' that he

filed an application in this Court in January 2019 and that the said application

was withdrawn with permission to file a fresh application explaining the

7

reasons for the delay. There is no doubt a long delay in filing the first

application. The explanation offered by the Petitioner in 'P23' is that he met

with an accident in January 2018 and that he suffered injuries to his right leg

and spine, which prevented him from attending t o his regular duties until

August 2018. The Petitioner has annexed to the petition marked 'P24' a

medical certificate issued by a registered Ayurvedic medical practitioner. Quite

apart from not specifying even the date of the accident, the Petitioner has not

produced any other material to demonstrate that he in fact met with an

accident. However, the necessity for this Court to consider the adequacy of the

explanation for the delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court does not

arise in view of the conclusion reached by this Court that there is no merit in

this application.

In the above circu mstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

notices on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
