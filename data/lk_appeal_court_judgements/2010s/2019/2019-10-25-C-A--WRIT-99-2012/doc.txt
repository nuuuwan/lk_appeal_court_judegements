When this matter was taken up for argument on 5th December 2018, the

learned President's Counsel for the parties moved that this Court pronounce its

judgment on the written submissions that would be tendered on behalf of the

parties.

1 The 4" Respondent has been discharged from this applicatio n.

2

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief

from this Court:

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent, Sri

Lankan Airlines Limited, to terminate the Petitioner's Cadet Pilot Training,

which decision is reflected in the documents annexed to the petition

marked 'P24' and 'P29';

2. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st -3'd Respondents to afford the

Petitioner a second attempt in the Final Full Flight Simulator Evaluation.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that he is a 'Licensed Commercial Pilot' who has

successfully completed several aviation training courses. He states further that

having completed the relevant foreign license conversion course, he has

received a Commercial Pilot License from the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri

Lanka 2

By an advertisement published in the Sunday Observer newspaper of 19th

December 2010, the 1st Respondent had invited applications for its "Cadet Pilot

Intake". The Petitioner had responded to the said advertisement and

subsequent to being successful at the several interviews that followed, had

secured a place as a 'Trainee Cadet Pilot' at the 1st Respondent Airline. By

letter dated 30th March 2011 annexed to the petition marked 'P14', the 1st

Respondent had informed the Petitioner inter alia as follows:

' A copy of the said license issued by the 4th Respondent has been annexed to the petition, marked 'PS'.

3

"With reference to your application and selection process for the post (of)

Cadet Pilot with Sri Lankan Airlines, it is with pleasure we offer you

training as a Cadet Pilot with effect from 18th April 2011 subject to your

being security screened and medically checked.

Nothing in this offer of training shall be canstrued to mean or imply an

obligation on the part of the Company to employ you after the training

period. Nor does this training confer any rights of priority in consideration

for selection for any future jobs at the Company."

Thus, on the face of it, 'P14' was simply an offer to provide training to the

Petitioner as a Cadet Pilot, at the 1st Respondent Airline.

In order to commence the training programme, the Petitioner was required to

enter into an Agreement with the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner states that he

accordingly entered into the 'Agreement for Training of Cadet Pilots' with the

1st Respondent on 31st March 2011. A copy of the said Agreement has been

annexed to the petition marked 'P15'. In addition, the Petitioner had entered

into a Surety Bond for a sum of Rs. 8,000,000. The Petitioner states that he was

also required to obtain an insurance policy valid for a period of 8 months from

18th April 2011 to 18th December 2011 in a sum of Rs. 6,651,350 to cover the

cost of the training, with the 1st Respondent being the beneficiary under the

said policy.

On 18th April 2011, the Petitioner, together with fourteen others, had

commenced the training programme, which consisted of three components,

4

namely Ground School Training, Simulator Training and Line Training. The

Petitioner states that after the successful completion of the Ground School

Training, the Cadet Pilots were split into groups of two, for the purpose of

being sent to Singapore, Malaysia or Dubai to complete the Airbus 320

Simulator Training, as no simulator was available in Sri Lanka at the time. The

Petitioner and another Cadet Pilot from the same batch were scheduled to

undergo Simulator Training in Malaysia in November 2011. However, on 20th

October 2011, an Airbus 320 Simulator had been installed and opened in Sri

Lanka at the premises of the 1st Respondent and the Petitioner and his batch

mate who were scheduled to undergo their simulator training in Malaysia,

were requested to do their Simulator Training in Sri Lanka.

The Petitioner states that from the time of its installation, the simulator of the

1st Respondent had many technical issues. The Petitioner has annexed a

photograph marked 'P21' of a notice containing several issues relating to the

simulator, which was affixed in the briefing room notice board of the 1st

Respondent. The Petitioner also states that during the period of 15th -16th

December 2011, the simulator was grounded by the 4th Respondent, the Civil

Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka, due to it malfunctioning.

Having completed the Simulator Training on 18th December 2011, the

Petitioner had undertaken the 'Final Full Flight Simulator Evaluation' (FFFS

Evaluation) on 20

th December 2011 in the same simulator installed in the

premises of the 1st Respondent. It is the position of the Petitioner that during

his FFFS Evaluation, the simulator started to malfunction and that his

performance was severely affected by the malfunctioning of the simulator,

resulting in the tail of the airline striking the runway.

5

The Respondents have however disputed the narration of events of the

Petitioner that led to the above situation. The Respondents state that during

the FFFS Evaluation, the Petitioner was involved in a clear 'crash situation due

to a tail strike that involved basic safety' arising from the negligence of the

Petitioner. As a result, the Petitioner's performance was considered to be of

unsatisfactory standard and the Petitioner's FFFS Evaluation had been

discontinued and terminated. This Court must observe at this stage that

whether there existed defects in the simulator and if so, whether such defects

affected the Petitioner are all disputed questions of fact, which this Court, in

the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction, cannot go into.

As the Petitioner had failed to successfully complete the FFFS evaluation, the

1st Respondent states that it was compelled to terminate the training of the

Petitioner with effect from 20th December 2011, by letter dated 3rd January

2012, annexed to the petition marked 'P24', It is the position of the

Respondents that in terms of Clause 8 of the Agreement for Training of Cadet

Pilots marked 'P1S', the 1st Respondent Company is entitled to terminate the

said Agreement on any of the grounds specified therein. 3 On this occasion, it is

the position of the Respondents that the Petit ioner 'failed to make satisfactory

progress in the said training and failed to achieve the expected standards of the

company'.

' In terms of Clause 8 of 'P1S', "The Company shall be at liberty to amend, curtail, terminate the training course of training period, rescind this agreement and/or recall the trainee from the training course at any time for any one or more of the following reasons. 8.1 Where the Trainee by his work and/or conduct renders himself unsuitable in the opinion of the company to continue with the course of study contemplated in the training course. 8.2 Where the trainee fails to show sufficient application or fails to make satisfactory progress in the course of study contemplated in the training Course and/or is unlikely to achieve the result/standard for which the training course of study of training is designed. "

6

The Petitioner had thereafter sought a re-evaluation of the FFFS Evaluation

through letters of appeal dated 28th December 2011 marked 'P2S' and 29th

January 2012 marked 'lR13'. By letter dated 2ih February 2012, marked

'lRl4', the Petitioner had been informed that the decision to terminate his

training could not be changed since the Petitioner had 'failed to achieve the

expected standards of the Company'. The Respondents have also taken up the

position that in terms of Clause 7 of the Agreement 'PlS', the certificates and

reports certified by the nominated official, in this case the 5th Respondent,

regarding the trainee's suitability, fitness and progress shall be final and

conclusive and binding on the respective parties.

It is against the said decision to terminate the Petitioner's Cadet Pilot Training

that the Petitioner has filed this application, seeking the aforementioned relief.

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner, it has been

submitted that 'the Petitioner principally impugns' the wrongful and

unreasonable termination of his flight training as a Cadet Pilot, which of course

arises from the Agreement 'PlS'. The principal contention of the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner is that the termination of his training was

irrational due to the fact that the simulator on which he performed his

Simulator Training on 18th December 2011 and on which the FFFS Evaluation

was carried out on 20th December 2011 was malfunctioning. This Court

observes that the Petitioner has made extensive submissions on the

functioning of the simulator and the interferences by the Supervisors which

allegedly caused the Petitioner to fail the said test, which have however been

denied by the Respondents. As observed earlier, where the principal facts are

disputed, this Court, in the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction, cannot go into such

disputed facts.

7

The learned President's Counsel for the 1st -3rd and 5th Respondents (the

Respondents) have raised a preliminary objection that the purported dispute

before this Court arises out of a contract and for that reason, this Court does

not have the jurisdiction to entertain this application. As this objection relates

to the maintainability of this application, and as the Petitioner himself

concedes that what is being impugned before this Court arises out of the

agreement 'PIS' between the parties, this Court is of the view that it should

first consider whether in such circumstances, the Petitioner can invoke the

Writ jurisdiction of this Court.

The Writ jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution

is limited inter alia to an examination of the legality of a decision of a body

exercising a public or statutory function . The Supreme Court as well as this

Court have consistently upheld the argument that this jurisdiction cannot be

extended to examine rights and obligations arising from a private contract,

even if the act that is being challenged is that of a statutory authority, unless

there is a statutory flavour to the act that is being impugned.

In Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and

another4 a Writ of Certiorari was sought to quash the termination of an

agreement between the petitioner and the Board of Investment. The

respondents raised a preliminary objection that the petitioner was seeking

relief based on a breach of a contractual right and therefore the petitioner

cannot maintain the said application.

(2002) BLR 10

Having considered the underlying facts, this Court held as follows:

"An analysis of the relationship that existed between the parties reveals

that as it was purely a contractual one of commercial nature, neither

certiorari nor mandamus will lie to remedy the dispute over the rights of

the parties. The purported breach of such rights (and) the grievance(s)

between the parties, arise entirely from a breach of contract, even if one

of the parties was a statutory or public authority. ,,5

This Court then went onto consider if the fact of the 1st Respondent being a

statutory authority would lend to the commercial arrangement between the

parties, a statutory flavour, thus enabling the petitioner in that case to invoke

the writ jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution. This Court,

having taken into consideration the fact that even though the power to enter

into a contract arises from the statute, the terms and conditions between the

parties were entirely contractual and that the decision that was sought to be

quashed was purely contractual, held as follows:

"Therefore the exercise of powers by parties in terms of the agreement,

exclusively arises thraugh the contract and though one of the parties is a

public authority, rights of the parties are not amenable to writ

jurisdiction. ,,6

This position has been reiterated in Gawarammana vs. Tea Research Board

and Others7 where Sripavan J (as he then was), held as follows:

s Ibid. page 11 ' Ibid. page 12

7 [200313 Sri LR 120 at page 124.

9

"The powers derived from contract are matters of private law. The fact

that ane of the parties to the contract is a public authority is not relevant

since the decision sought to be quashed by way of Certiarari is itself was

not made in the exercise of any statutory power (vide Jayaweera v.

Wijeratne)."s

A similar view has been expressed by this Court in De Alwis v Sri Lanka

Telecom and Others9 where a writ of Certiorari had been sought to quash the

decision to disconnect the telephone connection of the petitioner on the basis

of non-payment of charges. This Court, while refusing the writ held as follows:

"The decision sought to be quashed is a decision founded purely on

contract. The telephone was disconnected for failure to settle the

outstanding bills as provided for in the agreement. This was a decision

taken wholly within the context of the contractual relationship between

the parties and not in the exercise of the powers of a public authority.

Neither Certiorari or Mandamus will lie to remedy the grievances arising

from an alleged breach of contract. (vide Jayaweera v. wijeratne)."lO

In Chandradasa v. Wijeratnell, the Supreme Court when called upon to

consider whether a dispute under a contract of employment is outside the Writ

jurisdiction held as follows:

8 [1985J 2 Sri LR 413.

9 [1995J 2 Sri LR 38 at page 41.

10 Supra.

"[1982J 1 Sri LR at 412 at page 416.

"As observed by Lord Norris of Broth-Y-Guest in University Council of

Vidyodaya University v. Linus Silva (66 NLR 505 at p.518) the mere fact

that the University is established by Statute does not necessarily make its

powers statutory; it may engage its employees under ordinary contracts of

service. The Act does not deal with the question of dismissal of employees

at all. It does not specify when and how an employee can be dismissed

from service - the grounds of dismissal or the procedure for dismissal. So

that, when the respondent made his order of dismissal, he did so in the

exercise of his controctual power of dismissal and not by virtue of any

statutory power. "Certiorari is not available to review a disciplinary

decision taken by a public authority against an employee with whom it has

only a contractual relationship." (Smith, 4th Edn. at p.365). If the

petitioner's dismissal was in breach of the terms of the employment

contract, the proper remedy is an action for declaration or damages. The

Court will not quash the decision on the ground that natural justice has

not been observed."12

It is the position of the Respondents that the Petitioner was contracted in the

capacity of a Trainee Cadet Pilot only and that there was no contract of

employment between the parties. The Petitioner was therefore only a

participant in the Cadet Pilots training programme.

The above dicta illustrate the consistent view taken by our Courts that disputes

ariSing out of contractual relationships do not attract public law remedies such

as Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus. Bearing in mind the propositions of law

12 The above position has been reiterated in Siva KUmar v. Director General, Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka and Another [[2007)1 Sri LR 96) and in M.P.A.U.S. Fernando and Others vs. Timberlake International (Pvt) Limited [SC Appeal No. 06/2008; SC Minutes 20' March 2010).

11

laid down by the above judgments, this Court will now consider the

relationship that existed between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent. As

observed at the outset, the Petitioner responded to an advertisement placed

by the 1st Respondent calling for applications to train suitable candidates as

Cadet Pilots. The Petitioner responded to the said advertisement and having

successfully faced several interviews, was chosen to undergo the said training.

It is not in dispute that the parties entered into the Agreement 'P1S' in order to

set out the rights and obligations of the parties during the period of the

training. It is the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the

Respondents that "all matters pertaining to the providing of training as a Cadet

Pilot including the training programme, conducting of examinations and tests

and the termination thereof, are governed by the Agreement marked P13."

Thus, the Respondents have argued that the relationship between the

Petitioner and the 1st Respondent is purely a contractual relationship. This

Court has examined 'P1S' and observes that in terms of Clause 2 thereof, the

1st Respondent was only required to provide the Petitioner with the Training

Course as described in Schedule 2. It was the obligation of the Petitioner 'to

proceed to the training location as may be directed by the 1st Respondent and

diligently pursue the instruction and training provided' by the 1st Respondent.

It has also been submitted in the written submissions of the Petitioner that the

Petitioner could not have refused to engage in simulator training even though

the simulator was malfunctioning, as that would have been a breach of the

Training Agreement. This is an admission that everything relating to the

simulator training arose from the agreement.

12

Clause 8 of the Agreement 'P1S' provides that where the Petitioner by his work

and/or conduct renders himself unsuitable in the opinion of the 1st Respondent

to continue with the Course of Study, the 1st Respondent shall have the right to

terminate the Agreement and to recall the trainee from the training course.

It is also not in dispute that the Petitioner did not successfully complete the

FFFS evaluation. While the reason for such non-completion is not relevant to

the preliminary objection that this Court is now considering, the fact of the

matter is that the 1st Respondent exercised its rights under the Agreement

'P1S' when it decided to terminate the training period of the Petitioner. The

Petitioner himself admits that 'the Petitioner principally impugns' the wrongful

and unreasonable termination of his flight training as a Cadet Pilot, which

arises from the Agreement 'P1S'. If that be so, does not the cause of action of

the Petitioner arise from the Agreement 'P1S'?

In the reply written submissions, it has been submitted on behalf of the

Petitioner that the decision to terminate is ultra vires and disproportionate as

First Officers and Captains who have flying experience are given two attempts

during their final evaluation checks whereas a Cadet Pilot is only given one

chance. Even if this be so, the decision of the 1st Respondent arises from the

powers that the 1st Respondent had in terms of 'P1S' and is therefore a

decision taken on a purely contractual and commercial basis.

Taking into consideration the above circumstances, it is clear to this Court that

the relationship between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent Company is

solely based on the Agreement for Training of Cadet Pilots marked 'P1S' and

13

that there can be no doubt that the conduct of the 1st Respondent that is

complained of arises out of the Agreement 'P1S'.

Even if this Court accepts the argument of the Petitioner that the decision to

terminate the traineeship of the Petitioner is unreasonable, can this Court

issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to afford the Petitioner

a second attempt in the FFFS Evaluation? It would perhaps be appropriate to

refer at this stage to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Ratnayake and

others vs CD. Perera and others13 where it was held as follows:

"The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty.

Where officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to

perform, Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty,

in the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is

only granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and

not merely of private character that is to say for the enforcement of a

mere private right, stemming from a contract of the parties -

"The duty to be performed must be of a public nature. A Mandamus will

not lie to order admission or restoration to an office essentially of a

private character, nor in general, will it lie to secure the due performance

of the obligations owed by a company towards its members, or to resolve

any other private dispute, such as a claim to reinstatement to

membership of a trade union, nor will it issue to a private arbitral

tribunal" de Smith judicial Review 4th Ed. page 540."

" (1982) 2 Sri LR 451.

14

The above position has been reiterated in Jayawardena vs. People's Bank14

where it was held as follows:

"Courts will always be ready and willing to apply the constitutional remedy

of mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must

necessarily be a situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a

public duty an intrusion by this Court by way of mandamus into an area

where remedial measures are available in private law would be to redefine

the availability of a prerogative writ."

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to a Writ of Mandamus even if this Court holds that the decision of the

1st Respondent, taken under the Agreement 'PiS', is irrational.

The Respondents have also argued that the relief sought by the Petitioner

cannot be granted due to the fact that the 1st Respondent is not a State

functionary. In the Statement of Objections of the 1st - 3rd Respondents15, it is

asserted that the 1st Respondent is not a State agency or instrument which is

dependent on State financing and that it is in fact a classic example of a public

limited company which is engaged in a commercial venture, with commercial

motivations and objectives. In light of the conclusion reached by this Court that

the issue in the present application is one that had arisen out of a contract and

therefore does not fall within the scope of the Writ jurisdiction conferred by

Article 140, the necessity to make a determination on whether or not the 1st

Respondent Company is a State functionary does not arise.

14 [2002J 3 Sri LR 17 .. lSParagraph 65(c).

15

In the above circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the learned

President's Counsel for the Respondents that the purported complaints of the

Petitioner are entirely contractual and that the Petitioner therefore cannot

invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
