Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner airman filed this application seeking to quash

decision P7 whereby the Commander of the Air Force discharged

him from service effective from 06.07.2015 on the basis of Service

No Longer Required (SNLR).

The petitioner in paragraph 49 of the petition states that this

decision is illegal, ultra vires, pervert, violative of the rules of

natural justice and doctrine of double jeopardy, and against the

legitimate expectation of the petitioner inasmuch as:

a) it was taken without considering the true reasons for the

absence of the petitioner;

b) the Commander failed to consider the prolonged mental

condition caused due to illegal detention and interrogation;

c) the petitioner was not sufficiently allowed to state his case

against the charge;

d) it is tantamount to punishing twice.

Let me now turn to P7. It lists out 10 separate charges and the

punishments meted out to the petitioner. They are as follows:

It appears to me that the petitioner has filed this action on the

basis that he was discharged from service on SNLR for the last

mentioned offence. That is not correct. I will explain it later.

Before that, let me have a closer look at the last offence, which is

being absent from service for 259 days from 03.07.2014-

19.03.2015 without approved leave.

The complaint of the petitioner is that he was not sufficiently

allowed to state his case against the charge and not that he was

completely shut out from unfolding his side of the story.

What the petitioner states is that during that period he was

receiving treatment for his deranged mental condition caused due

to harassments by the officers of the Air Force. However, in my

view, the crux of the matter is whether he stayed away from duties

for such a long time with approved leave. The petitioner was not

on approved leave. It is not the case of the petitioner that he

applied for leave but was refused unreasonably. The medical

records tendered to Court do not suggest that the petitioners

mental condition was so severe that he went completely insane

during that period preventing him from applying for leave.

It is a mistake to think that the petitioner was discharged from

service on the last offence. The petitioner has been discharged

from service taking his entire past conduct listed in P7 into

consideration. This the Commander of the Air Force says he did

6

by virtue of the powers vested in him by Regulations made under

the Air Force Act and published in the Gazette No. 10,665 dated

23.04.1954 marked R13.

It is the contention of the learned ASG that the Commander has

been given such authority in order to maintain discipline in the Air

Force. I am in full agreement that, unlike in any other institution,

if there is no discipline in the members of the Armed Forces

including Police Force, those institutions cannot possibly run. In

short, if there is no discipline, there is no Army, Navy or Air Force.

This is equally true to the Police Force.

I am fortified in this view inter alia by Article 15(8) of the

Constitution, which states:

The exercise and operation of the fundamental rights declared

and recognized by Articles 12(1), 13 and 14 shall, in their

application to the members of the Armed Forces, Police Force

and other Forces charged with the maintenance of public

order, be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by

law in the interests of the proper discharge of their duties and

the maintenance of discipline among them.

Article 12(1) primarily deals with right to equality; Article 13 with

freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment; and

Article 14 with freedom of speech, assembly, association,

occupation and movement.

However, this power of the Commander given by R13 is not

unfettered. He shall exercise that power on sound, time-tested

principles. That power is reviewable by this Court in a properly

7

constituted writ application. In the facts and circumstances of this

case, I cannot bring myself to conclude that the Commander has

exercised that authority arbitrarily or capriciously.

Anil Gooneratne J. in Mangala Pushpakumara v. Air Chief Marshal

Roshan Gunathilake (CA/WRIT/448/2009) decided on 28.3.2013,

held that such discharge from service is not made as a punishment

and therefore does not violate the doctrine of double jeopardy. This

discharge on SNLR is to maintain discipline for the greater benefit

of the Air Force. Punishments have been given to the petitioner

separately for separate offences from 1996. The last punishment,

according to P7, has been given on 03.06.2015. The Discharge is

from 06.07.2015, and the date of P7 is 09.07.2015.

The learned counsel for the petitioner in his short written

submission acknowledges the authority of the Commander to

discharge an officer on the basis of SNLR. However the learned

counsels submission is that in the aforementioned Gazette marked

R13, Fifth Schedule, Table B, item (xiii) (a) Applies only to an

airman who cannot be discharged under any other item, yet the

petitioner was not an airman but a sergeant. By looking at the

Fifth Schedule Table B item (xiii) (b) it seems that, among the non-

commissioned officers, except Warrant Officers, all others are

considered as Airmen. The learned counsel does not show any

other item under which the petitioner could have been discharged.

For the aforesaid reasons, I proceed to dismiss the application,

which I do without costs.
