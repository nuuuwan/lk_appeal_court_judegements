Before: K.K. Wickramasinghe, J.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Vishva Vimukthi for the 2nd Party Appellant.

1st Party Respondent is absent and

unrepresented.

Decided on: 15.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The first information under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979 was filed by the police in the

Magistrates Court making the 1st party husband (respondent)

and the 2nd party wife (appellant) parties to it, over a dispute in

relation to a house. By that time, they had got divorced. After

the inquiry, the learned Magistrate, in terms of section 68(3) of

the Act, held with the respondent on the basis that the

respondent had been in possession of the house until he was

dispossessed by the appellant within two months prior to the

filing of the first information. This was affirmed by the High

Court. This appeal is from that Judgment of the High Court.

On the date on which the respondent is alleged to have been

dispossessed, i.e. 05.09.2010, he has made a complaint to the

police.1 The following day, i.e. 06.09.2010, S.I. Wasantha has

visited the place and observed that the appellant had broken the

old padlocks of the gate and the main door of the house and

replaced them with new padlocks. S.I. Wasantha has informed

the appellant who was in the house to come to the police station

1 Vide page 87 of the Appeal Brief.

on the following day at 9.00 am.2 The appellant has made a

statement to the police on the following day.3 In that statement

she has admitted that she left the house about three months ago

to stay in a rented-out house. She has further stated that both

of them (she and her ex-husband) had the keys of the house and

as usual she came to the house without using any force. This is

false, and false to the knowledge of the appellant. However

before this Court she takes up a different position and says that:

The appellant became aware that the respondent by using an

extra key which he had obtained prior to the divorce had entered

the house situated in the land in dispute. Therefore the appellant

changed the padlock and keys of the house in order to prevent

him from entering the house and further threatening and

harassing the children.4 This is also false and contrary to her

statement to the police, which she made soon after the incident.

Learned counsel for the appellant drawing attention of Court to

Iqbal v. Majedudeen [1999] 3 Sri LR 213 says that the appellant

had constructive possession. That is not acceptable on her own

admissions which I stated above.

I see no reason to interfere with the Judgment of the High Court.

Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
