This case raises the interesting inter~play between Muslim law and Roman Dutch law

in regard to donations. The pivotal issue in this case is whether a Muslim mother's deed

of gift bearing No.544 and dated 16.09.1986 which was executed in favour of her son is

governed by Muslim law or Roman Dutch law- the residuary law of this country. The

answer to this questionfeads one to the oft-quoted qu:~stion for all times. Is a decree of

court essential to revoke the aforesaid deed of gift or Is a unilateral revocation of the

deed of gift by the mother sufficient to eventuate in the revocation of deed? As vital as

these issues are, it is apposite to traverse the facts.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (the donee son who is hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Plaintiff") received the gift of a land from his donor-mother on 16.09.1986 when she

executed a deed of donation bearing No.544 (PI) and attested by Notary Public A.I.M.

Anver. It has to be noted that PI recites itself as an in;evocable deed of gift subject to

2

the life interest of the donor. The recitations in the deed of gift date 16.09.1986 merit

recapitulation.

"NOW KNOW YE AND THESE PRESENTS WITNESS that the said donor in pursuance of the said

agreement and in consideration of the natural love and affection I bear unto my beloved son Mohammed

Samoon Mohamed Nilemdeen .... do hereby grant, convey, set ov.~r and assure unto him the said Donee

his heirs, executors, admini-trators and assigns as a gift or donation inter vivos absolute and

irrevocab le ... "

"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said premises hereby granted and conveyed unto the said Donee and

his afore written subject to the condition that the Donor herself shall have the right to possess and enjoy

the profits of the land and pre~lises hereby donated during her qfe~time"

Thus whilst the deed of d:onation executed by a Mushm mother to her son recites in the

main that it is irrevocable, it reserves to the donor during her life~time the right to

possess and enjoy the profits of the land and premises.

\Vhen a Muslim donor. combines in hislher deed of donation irrevocability and life~

interest, is that deed gov~rned by Muslim law or Roman Dutch law the common law of

the country? Presently I will return to this question but not before I have alluded to the

dispute that has found its way to this Court from the District Court of Kurunegala.

Five years after the deed of donation, it would appear that the donor mother had a

change of heart and she seems to have veered towards another son of hers~as a result

she revoked the deed of gift by her deed bearing No.2833 and dated 27.03.1989 (P2),

despite the fact that it .,~,.:'l s irrevocable on the face of iT. Thereafter she transferred the

land by a deed of sale t,6 her younger son (Mohamed Sameen Mohamed Raslim pt

Defendant) bearing No.2859 and dated 27.04.19891 (P3). FIve years later, the pt

defendant transferred it to the 2nd Defendant (P4) by a deed bearing No.181 and dated

16.05.1994.

3

The Plaintiff's assertion was that the deed of revocation (P2) was invalid and therefore

the subsequent conveyances (P3 and P4) have all become null and void ipso facto. This

was the case presented b7 the Plaintiff in his plaint dated 26.04.1996,

As opposed to this versio:u, the Defendants contended that the deed of gift (PI) in favour

of the Plaintiff was invalid in law because a deed of gift under the Muslim law could not

be given subject to conc:itions. In other words it could not be encumbered with a life

interest.

It is indisputably true thar under the Muslim law a deed of gift cannot be given subject

to conditions as stated. Azaf A.A.Fyzee defines Gift in his celebrated Outlines of

Muhammadan Law (Fifth Edition, 2008) thus:

"a man may lawfully mahe a gift of his property to another dllring his lifetime: all he may give

it away to sorncone after his death by will. The fIrst is called a disposition inter vivos; the second

a testamentary disposition.l'vfllslim Imv pcrrnits both hi nels of transfers; but while a disposition

l' . . . inter vivos is unfettefed as to quantum, a testamentary dispOSition is limited to one third of

the net estate. [\tIusli,n lcnv allcrws a mall to give away the '.vholc of his property during his

lifetime; hut only one third of it can he bequeathed by lvill."

The three essentials of a gift (Hil)(l) are: (i) declaration of the gift by the donor; (ii)

acceptance of the gift by the done; (iii) delivery of possession. The Privy Council has

adopted and approved of ,l passage in Ameer Ali which lays down the three conditions

necessarv for a valid \2j1t-;;ee Sved Ameer Ali lvlahommedanLaw Vol 1, Calcutta 1912 J L) -' page 41. They are '(1) ma~jJestatjon of the \V18h to givc'on the part of the donor. (2) the

acceptance of the donee, either impliedly or expressly. (3) The taking possession of the

subject matter of the gift by the donee, either actually or constructively-see the Privy

Council decisions of A1obaInm:u! Abdul G/wniv F~lklv../alwn Begum (1922) 49 IA 195;

Alnj;ld Khan vAshmf Kb:ln (1929) 56 IA 213.

4

So under :ivlushrn Law three things are necessary to an effective donation: an intention

to give, an acceptance b~l the donee, and a seisin of the property by the donee. In the

present case the deed of lonation (PI) itself shovvs th:lt there \vas no intention to make

an absolute gift. It expressly says that the donee is not to possess the property until

after the death of the donors, so that no question of seisin, constructive or otherwise,

can arise under this dec d, as the deed itself in its tfT111S does not give the property

absolutely. The :tvluslim l.~tw requires that there should be a clear intention to give the

property absolutely. The reservation in this case of a life interest for the donor does not

vest the donee \\Tith an immediate seisin of the property and therefore this is not a gift

(hiba) known to I'vluslilT; law. The donor reserved to herself a usufruct of the subject

matter so that she would have the usc, benefit, produce or profits. A

In fact a Muslim is not prevented from making a \'alid gift under the common law

(Roman Dutch law) suhject to conditions, if he so desires. Sections 3 and 4 of the

Muslim Intestate Succes'sion Ordinance No.lO of 1931 makes it patently clear. This

legislation on Muslim law contains only four sectiom;.

Section 3 states as follo'ws:~

"For the purposes of avoiding and removing all doubts it is hereby declared that the law

applicable to donati01J~; not involving usufructs and tnLsts, and made by Muslims domiciled in

Sri Lanka or owning immovable property in Sri Lanka, shall be the Muslim law governing the

sect to which the dOrlor belongs:

Provided that no deed of donation shall be deemed to be irrevocable unless it is so stated in the

deed, and the delivt:1)' of the deed to the donee shall be accepted as evidence of delivery of

possession of the movchle or the immovable property donated by the deed."

I,

According to the terms ..::ouched in the section an important principle emanates "that

the donations made by Muslims not involving usufructs or trusts are governed by Muslim law".

5

, /i

So section 3 applies only to donations made by a Muslim not involving usufri.tcts or

trusts. This provision t:onveys the principle that a Muslim, although governed by

Muslim law, is still fref r.o make a gift involving usufruct or trust governed under the

common law. This positicJn is further clarified by Section 4 of this Ordinance which

states as follows:~

"It is hereby further declared that the principles of law prL'Vailing in the Maritime provinces shall

apply to all donations other than those to which the Muslim law is made applicable by section

3."

At the outset I posed an initial question which is pivotal to the resolution of the issue

before me. The donor being a Muslim made a donation of her land but reserved a

usufruct till her life time. Section 4 puts it beyond any doubt. The law prevailing in the

Maritime provinces shall apply to all such donations, other than the donations made

under Section 3, made by a Muslim. If he chooses to make a donation under Section 3,

then the law applicable is Muslim law. But it is open to him to make a donation under

Section 4 as well if he so desires and in those circulTlstances the law applicable is not 1 . Muslim law but law of th.e Maritime Provinces which is indeed Roman Dutch Law. In

f:> ... Kiry Menika v Kiry Menika (1855) Ramanathan (184 3~ 1855) 62 where the application

of the Roman Dutch Law of possessory remedies was discussed, the Supreme Court

held: " .... As the Kandya!l Law is silent on such right of possession, the Maritime law

(namely the Roman Dutch Law) should now be the law for the determination of such

matter or question in the Kandyan provinces under the 5th Clause of Ordinance No 5 of

1852."

Sections 3 and 4 of the r:Auslim Intestate Ordinance 'which deal with donations make

it as plain as pikestaff that a Muslim may make a gift under the Muslim law in terms of

Section 3, whilst under Section 4 he can make a gift under the common law. In the

former case a gift is made without conditions and in the latter case he can reserve or

impose any condition such as usufruct or life interest etc. This principle has been

6

authoritatively laid doWn, by the Supreme Court in llaseena Umma v. Jemaldeen 68

N.LR300.

In this case it was held:~

" .. .that when a Muslim creates usufruct or fidei commissum while gifting an immovable

property, the law a}7plicable would be the common law the Roman Dutch law, by virtue of

section 4 of the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance!'.

In this case the Supreme Court also followed the earlier judgment in A]iya Marikkar

Ahoo Thahir v. Aliya Marikkar Modammed Saly 43 N.LR 193.

In Aliya Marikkar (sul)ra) a Muslim executed a deed of gift in favour of his sons,

reserving to himself and his wife, if she survives him the right to take, enjoy and receive

the rents and profits of the property gifted, during their lifetime. He also reserved to

himself the right to revoke and cancel the gift at his w'Ill and pleasure. The gift was also

subject to a fidei commissum in favour of the donee's children. The donee and the donor's

wife accepted the gift.

The Supreme Court held:

"that the deed created a valid fidei commissum.and was a valid gift under the general law

although between Mllslims"

In this case the Supreme Court followed the Privy Cc,uncil judgment in Weerasekara

v. Peiris43 N.LR 281.

In this case a deed of gil( was made by a Muslim subj~ct to his right to revoke the gift

and subject to his life interest. He had also created a fidei commissum imposing

restrictions on alienation~.

7

Held- "that the donor created a valid fidei commissum such as is recognized by the Roman Dutch law

and that the donor did not intend to make such a gift as is recognized under the Muslim law

which necessitates .;he donee taking possession of the subject matter of the gift during the

lifetime of the donor"

All these cases demonsc';lte that a Muslim may make a deed of gift reserving a life

interest or usufruct and even creating a fidei commissum or trust and even reserving his

right to revoke the gift or irrevocable, valid under the common law. If he so wishes he

can make a gift without any of these conditions a pure and simple gift valid under the

Muslim law. In the proviso to Section 3 of the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance

it is stated as follows:-

"Provided that no dt:e;::' of donation shall be deemed to be irrevocable unless it is so stated in the

deed .... "

These proviso makes it clear that a Muslim donor can make a gift irrevocable but he

make a gift irrevocable only if the deed declares itself to be irrevocable.

In the case before me the donor Ismail Lebbe Pathuma ' gifted the corpus to the Plaintiff

by her Deed bearing ~b.544 of 1986. 09.16 (PI) subject to her life interest, and

irrevocable. The defendants contended that this deed was invalid in Muslim law. The

foregoing authorities fortify the position that PI \.1;1S a valid gift under the Roman

Dutch Law.

Therefore the donor cannot revoke it on her own without an order of court. But in this

case donor revoked it by her Deed No.2833 of 1989. (P2) which is invalid in law. Because

there was no court sanct~;n for its validity.

An irrevocable Deed of Gift in Roman Dutch Law ~annot be revoked by a unilateral

Deed of Cancellation and it can only the revoked by an Order of Court upon well known

grounds for revocation. I went into a survey of all the authorities and Roman Dutch Law

8

Ie

jurists in Franklin Fer1!ando v Anacletus Fernandoand Others (2015) 1 SrLLR 1 and

distilled some well known principles on revocation in that precedent. In fact long

before Franklin Fernando (supra), our Courts have dealt with the question of whether

, , a decree of court was necessary for invalidation of deeds of gifts through Courts.

In the case of Kanpathipillai vs. Kannachy 13 N. L. R 166 where a Deed of Gift was

executed in favour of tb,~ Plaintiff without reserving the right to revoke the deed and

subsequently the Donor revoked the Deed of Gift by way of a Deed of Cancellation and

transferred the premises so gifted in favour of a 3rd party having knowledge of the Deed

i of Gift Grenier J. declaredi~s follows at page 166.

i' " It seems .to me that the first defendant had no right, so long as the deed of gift was in force, to

have either executeJ a deed of revocation, or following upon that, a deed of conveyance ...... my

own opinion is that the registration of what I consider a useless document by the second

defendant gave him no priority over the deed of gift so long as that deed remained unrevoked by

a decree of Court .. "

In the case of Krishnasail1Y v ThiUaiyampalam 59 N.L.R 265 Basnayake C.J stated

the following at page 267.

" .... An examinatiol1 of Perez ius's statement (Pradectiones Codicis]ustiniani, Booh VIII, Tit.

LVI, Sees. 4, 5 and 7-\Vihramanayahe's translation) does not show that hewas so dO,gmatic as

all that. He says : ./

" .... .The causes ofingrdtitude areflvc ill number, namely, if the donee outrageously insults the

" ' donor, or lays impious hands 011 him, or squanders his property or plots against his life or is

unwilling to fulfil the pact which ,was annexed to the gift

... a gift cannot be set aside for any other cause, both because d. I. HIt. when it enumerates these

five causes adds thilt gilts can be inv"z!idatedlor these causes alone if they Rre

proved in a court oflRw. .. "

9

This is what the decree of Justinian says:

"We decree, in gencral, that all donations made in conformity with law shall be valid and

irrevocable, and ifhewho receives the donation is notfiund to beguilty ofingratitLlde towards

the donor .....

"But onlyfor callses of this hind, where they have bee1l regularly proved in court by indisputable

evidence, do we permit donations made to sllch pcrson,\ be revo/~ed ....

"We, however, decrce:' that this provision shall only apply to the persons originally interested, as

permission is not gr:anted to the heirs of the donor to file complaints upon such grounds; for if

he who suffered thc\eindignitics remains silent, his silence should always continue, and his

posterity ought not to be allowed to institute legal proceedings, either against the individual

alleged to be LlngraL41l1, or his heirs."

"Given 011 thefifteentl; (~f the Kalcnds oIApril, during the Consulate ofLampadius and Orestes,

530. " (Code oIl Llstinian, BI? VIII, Tit. LVI, 05.10) Scotts translation, Vol. 14, p. 349.} '"

In the case of Mahawew-a VS. Mahawewa SC. Appeat No. 64/ 2008 , Thilakawardene

J. at page 4 states that:

" .. the Law on Donation and the Revocation of G~ft in Sri Lanha is governed by Roman Dutch

Law under which a Gift once donated can be revoked on grounds of gross ingratitude by the

Donee to the Donor. The Donor may initiate court proceedings to cancel the gift so donated."

This legal proposition was also articulated by Gamini Amarathunga J. in Ariyawathi

Meemaduwa VS. leewa,~li Bodika Meemaduwa SC l~ppeal. No. 68/ 2010 as follows;

" A deed of Gift is ab~olute and irrevocable. That is th:; rule. However, the law has recognized

, i, J certain exceptions to, the rule of irrevocability. A party applying to Court to invoke the

; "j exceptions in his fav;r has to satisfy the court, by cegent evidence, that the court would be

justified in invoking the exceptions in favour of the party applying the same."

10

In this case the donor never instituted any proceedings in court to revoke the Deed of

Gift, leave alone establish any exceptional grounds on which an absolute Deed of Gift

may be revoked. In the circumstances the mere execution of P2 does not entail the

revocation of PI.

Therefore, I take the view that the Donor of the Deed PI should have sought the

assistance of Court in order to invalidate Pl.

Since PI the Deed of Gift in favor of the Plaintiff remains a valid donation under the

Roman Dutch Law, the Donor could not have validly transferred the subject matter to

the pt Defendant and as Prof G.L.Peiris in the Law afProperty in Sri Lanka volume I states

at page 140 that the General Rule is that the transferor should be the owner at the time

delivery is made.

Accordingly, I take the view that the Plaintiff is entitled to a declaration that P2 the

Deed of Cancellation is null and void and in the circumstances P3, the Deed of Transfer

and P4 the Deed of Gift Donating a portion of the subject matter on the strength of the

title purportedly acquir~d by the pt Defendant by WclY of P2 should also be declared

null and void.

As such the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for in the amended plaint and as such

I proceed to set aside the judgement dated 19 September 2000 of the District Court of

Kurunegala and allow the appeal.
