K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

1. The Accused Respondent (Respondent) above named was indicted in

the High Court of Anuradhapura on Counts 1, 2 and 3 for committing

offences punishable under sections 436, 365 b (2) b, and 364(2} of the

Penal Code respectively. At the time of the alleged offences were

committed, victim Gunaratnage Lakmali Gunaratne had been below 16

years of age.

2. Upon serving of the indictment on 04.09.2012, the Respondent

pleaded not guilty to the charges. Although the case was fixed for trial, on

three occasions it had got postponed for various reasons. On the 4th date

fixed for trial, on 21.05.2014, the Accused had requested to plead guilty to

the charges. Hence the Learned High Court Judge had read over the

charges to the Respondent and he had pleaded guilty for the same.

3. On his own plea of guilty, the Learned High Court Judge had

proceeded to convict the Respondent and upon hearing the State Counsel

2

and the defence Counsel in mitigation the Learned High Court Judge

proceeded to sentence the Respondent. Respondent had been sentenced

to 2 years imprisonment on each of the three Counts to run consecutively

and was suspended for 10 years. In addition, the Respo ndent had been

ordered to pay Rs. 1,000/- on each Count as state costs. Further, the

Respondent had been ordered to pay the victim a sum of Rs. 100,000/- as

compensation and in default of payment to serve 6 months imprisonment.

4. The instant appeal has been filed by The State (Appellant) on

09.06.2014, against the said sentence of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 21.05. 2014.

A cross appeal had been filed by the Respondent, however, on

11.02.2019 when the appeal was taken up for argument, Counsel for the

Respondent informed this Court that the Respondent would not pursue

the cross appeal filed by him.

5. We carefully considered the proceedings in the High Court, written

submissions filed by Counsel for both Parties and the submissions made by

Counsel at the hearing of this appeal.

6. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Learned High Court

Judge has failed to impose the minimum mandatory prison sentence

prescribed by law for the offences of grave sexual abuse and rape in

Counts 2 and 3 respectively. Counsel also submitted that in the given

circumstances a stringent custodial sentence is warranted.

7. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Learned Trial Judge,

when deciding on the sentence, has taken the mitigatory circumstances

into account. In that, he said that as submitted in mitigation, the Learned

Trial Judge has considered the possible altercation between the parties

who a re relatives.

3

8. On Count No.3, the Respondent was charged for rape. Rape is the

most serious sexual offence. It aggravates when it is committed on a child.

The legislature taking the seriousness of the offence into account has

prescribed a minimum mandatory imprisonment sentence of 10 years.

Prescribed sentence for rape of a child in terms of section 364(2) of the

Penal code is rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and

not exceeding 20 years and with a fine. In addition, Court shall order the

Accused to pay compensation of an amount determined by Court to the

person in respect of whom the offence was committed.

9. Provided however, in terms of section 364(2), where the offence is

committed in respect of a person under 16 years of age, the Court may,

where the offender is a person under 18 years of age and the intercourse

has been with the consent of the person, impose a sentence of

imprisonment for a term less than 10 years.

10. In the instant case there is no evidence to the effect that the victim

child ever consented to the intercourse. The Complainant had been at

home alone when the Respondent had opened the door and had come

inside. He then had dragged her to the bed in the living room, forcefully

removed her clothes, among other things inserted his finger into her

vagina and then had raped her. Therefore, the prescribed punishment that

applies to the Respondent for rape in this instance for Count No.3, is

imprisonment for not less than 10 years and not exceeding 20 years and a

fine and compensation to the victim as determined by Court.

11. The prescribed punishment for Grave Sexual Abuse in Count No 2 in

terms of section 365 b (2) b of the Penal Code is, rigorous imprisonment

for a term not less than 7 years and not exceeding 20 years, and with a

fine, and compensation to the victim.

12. Prescribed punishment for Count No.1 in terms of section 436 of the

Penal Code is, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and a fine.

13. An Appellate Court will not interfere with the discretion used by a

Trial Judge when sentencing an Accused, unless the sentence imposed is

illegal or wrong in principle. Therefore, this court would consider whether

the Learned Trial Judge has erred in law or was wrong in principle when

she imposed a suspended sentence to the Accused for the offences of rape

and grave sexual abuse of a child, when in fact the law provides for a

minimum mandatory term of imprisonment.

14. In case of Attorney General V. Gunasena CA(PHC)APN 110 of 2012

[12.02.2014L this Court referring to what was held in case of Attorney

General V. Ranasinghe [1993] 2SLR 81 said that, an offence of rape calls for

an immediate custodial sentence. Reasons are, to mark the gravity of the

offence, to emphasize public disapproval, to serve as a warning to others,

to punish the offender and to protect the victim.

15. This Court in C.A. Appeal No. 297/08, on 11.10 2012, allowing the

appeal by the Attorney General, set aside the suspended sentence

imposed on the Accused in Child Rape Case No. 259/2006 by High Court

Kurunegala, and imposed a 10-year custodial sentence. Giving reasons for

the decision, His Lordship Ranjith Silva J. said;

lilt is true that the accused appellant pleaded guilty and that there is no other relief that he can expect other than some kind consideration from this court. The fact that he pleaded guilty should have been taken into account in deciding the sentence of imprisonment. This Court, although sympathetic towards the accused-appellant will be failing in its duty if it were to endorse the suspended sentence. The legislature has imposed a minimum mandatory sentence for this type of offences branding them as very serious offences, carrying a maximum sentence up to 20 years of imprisonment. It is not for the Courts to trifle with the intentions of the legislature . ...

5

Therefore, it is not proper to trifle with this type of offences and to allow people to commit offences and escape lightly. I hold that the suspended sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is highly inadequate or grossly inadequate and should be set aside. /I

16. On sentencing an Accused, His Lordship Basnayake, A.C.J. in The

Attorney General, and H.N. De Silva, (S.C 457-Application in Revision) said;

itA judge should, in determining the proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective . ... The reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an important consideration, is subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or welfare of the state (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good character, antecedents and the age of the offender, public interest must prevail. /I

17. There should be parity in sentencing. Disparity and inconsistency will

lead to criticism. Accused as well as the Complainant is entitled to know

the reason for the sentence and how the Court arrived at the same. An

Accused, or for that matter even the general public should know what the

range of a sentence would be in a case of child rape depending on the

aggravating and mitigating circumstances. There should not be a huge

disparity.

18. Section 303 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) provides the

instances where the Court should not make an order suspending a

sentence of imprisonment.

Section 303(2);

A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of imprisonment if-

6

(a) A mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment has been prescribed by law for the offence in respect of which the sentence is imposed or ...

19. As I mentioned before, for the offences mentioned in Counts

number 2 and 3, there is a minimum sentence of imprisonment prescribed.

Therefore, Court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment. This is not a case where sexual intercourse occurred

between young consenting persons who were in a relationship, to consider

deviating from the prescribed custodial sentence. Hence the Learned High

Court Judge has clearly erred when she decided to give away with the

punishment prescribed by law and to give a suspended sentence.

20. Learned High Court Judge in her sentencing remarks has said that the

Accused had committed a grave offence. However, she had said that there

would be a possible altercation between the two families and therefore

she considered a lenient sentence. Counsel for the Accused in High Court

also had made the same submission in mitigation. He had submitted that

the Accused and victim child are cousins and an altercation between the

parties may occur.

21. In this case, parents of the victim child had been separated and

victim had been living with the father. The Appellant, a married man who

was her cousin had taken advantage of the vulnerability of the child had

sexually abused her. It is a gross breach of trust which is an aggravating

factor. The possible altercation between the families can no way be

considered as a mitigating factor.

22. In the above premise, I find that the sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge is not in accordance with the law and also wrong

in principle. It is grossly inadequate and therefore is set aside.

7

23. I take into consideration the sentence prescribed by law for the

relevant offences in counts 1, 2 and 3. The aggravating factors are, that it is

a gross breach of trust as I mentioned before. Although, a victim impact

statement was not submitted, it is obvious that when a child is raped or

sexually abused, she is adversely affected mentally and physically. Medico

legal report speaks about the physical injuries to the hymen. In Asian

culture it will scar her life.

24. In mitigation, Court must give sufficient discount for the early guilty

plea. Unlike in other criminal offences, in cases of rape and sexual abuse,

by pleading guilty, the Accused prevents the mental trauma the victim

would undergo if she had to give evidence and subject herself to cross

examination. Age and the previous good behavior of the Appellant are also

taken into account.

25. Taking above aggravating and mitigating factors and the punishment

prescribed by law we sentence the Accused in the following manner.

Count No.1 -

Count No.2 -

2 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2000/-,

in default of payment of fine imprisonment for

2months.

7 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/-,

in default of payment of fine imprisonment for

3 months.

Count No.3 -10 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/-,

in default of payment of fine imprisonment for

3 months.

The above sentences of imprisonment on Counts 1, 2 and 3 are ordered to

run concurrently.

8

Appellant is also ordered to pay the victim (PW1) a sum of Rs. 100,000/-,

in default of payment to serve another 6 months' imprisonment.

Appeal is allowed. Sentence is varied as above.
