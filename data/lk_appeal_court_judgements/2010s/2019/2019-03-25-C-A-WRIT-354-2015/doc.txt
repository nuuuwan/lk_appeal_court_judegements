The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash by way

of certiorari:

a) the recommendation made by the Commander of the Sri

Lanka Army to His Excellency the President to withdraw

the commission of the petitioner from the Sri Lanka Army

as evidenced by R14, and

b) the finding of guilt and the lowering of the petitioners

seniority in the Sri Lanka Army by 150 slots as evidenced

by the documents compendiously marked as P5.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner seeks to

quash the recommendation made by the Commander of the

Army as reflected in R14 on three grounds.

a) The recommendation is based on the conviction and

sentence imposed by the Court of Inquiry, which had no

jurisdiction to do so.

b) The conviction was made on violation of rules of natural

justice inter alia without giving a proper hearing and

without adducing reasons.

c) The recommendation constitutes the imposition of double

punishment.

In general, recommendations are not amenable to writ

jurisdiction.

Assuming it is (as the said recommendation was the sole basis

for HE the President to withdraw the commission), the petitioner

is challenging in these proceedings, the conviction and sentence

entered and passed about 7 years ago. He is clearly guilty of

lashes, which disentitles the petitioner to successfully pursue a

discretionary relief such as writ. As seen from P6, he has

3

appealed against that conviction and sentence to the Director of

the Legal Branch of the Army and kept silent. No action has

been taken by the Director of the Legal Branch, obviously

because he has no authority to sit in appeal against those

convictions. At that time, he was a Major and not a soldier, and

therefore he should have known what he should do, if he were to

challenge those convictions. He has again started talking about

these convictions, after the withdrawal of his commission by HE

the President, several years later. As I will explain later, the

recommendation for withdrawal of commission is not solely

dependent upon this conviction.

The charges, in my view, serious and, above all, involve

inhuman, apart from indiscipline, activities on the part of the

petitioner, and if proved, warrant adequate punishment, nay

deterrent punishment.

The learned Presidents Counsel in the written submissions

states that conviction and sentence was imposed by a Court of

Inquiry, which had no jurisdiction to do so as a Court of Inquiry

is only a fact-finding mission having no authority to convict and

sentence an officer, and such conviction and sentence could

only have been imposed after a Court Marshal.

Such a position has not been taken up in the petition. However,

learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents, in the

reply submissions, drawing attention of this Court to sections 40

and 42 of the Army Act, No.17 of 1949, as amended, says that

the petitioner could have been so convicted and sentenced after

a summary trial without a Court Marshal for those offences.

There is a distinction between a Court of Inquiry and Summary

Trial. In this instance, the petitioner has been convicted and

sentenced not after a Court of Inquiry but after a Summary Trial.

This has been accepted by the petitioner himself in paragraph 3

of P6the appeal sent to the Director/Legalwhere he speaks of

a conviction after Summary Trial. He being a Major could not

have been unaware of the difference between Court of Inquiry

and Summary Trial.

Most importantly, I am unable to accept the argument of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the recommendation made by

the Commander of the Army is solely based on the said

conviction and sentence. R14 recommendation running into 4

pages is not solely based on the said conviction and sentence.

That is only a part of it but not all. There is no necessity to

reproduce R14 verbatim, which is self-explanatory. There had

been several misdeeds committed by him in addition to the ones

he was subjected to Summary Trial. As seen from R13, the

Army Advisory Board comprising of five very senior officers has

recommended to seek direction from HE the President for the

withdrawal of commission of the petitioner in the best interest

of the Army.

It is in that backdrop, the Commander of the Army has sent R14.

In paragraph 6 thereof the Commander states:

In view of the past records of this officer with considerable

number of disciplinary cases, I concur with the

recommendations made by the Army Advisory Board.

Further, I am of the opinion that further retention of this

officer in service would not be in the best interest of the

Army as he has set a bad example to his subordinates and

5

his behavior is unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman.

Therefore in my appointment as the Commander of the

Army in terms of the Army Discipline Regulations 1950

which provides that the Commander of the Army shall be

vested with general responsibility for discipline in the

Army, I am compelled to seek the direction of His

Excellency the President regarding the question of further

retention of this officer in service.

It is clear from the said excerpt that this recommendation does

not constitute the imposition of double punishment. The

Commander makes that request for the best interest of the Army

in terms of Regulation No. 2 of the Army Discipline Regulations

1950, which states that The Commander of the Army shall be

vested with general responsibility for discipline in the army.

The discipline of the Army is paramount importance, and shall

be best left to the Commander and not to the Court to deal with.

If there is no discipline, there is no Army. The Court in the

exercise of writ jurisdiction will not interfere with the internal

administration of the Army, which includes taking disciplinary

decisions, unless there are compelling cogent reasonssuch as

decisions are ex facie ultra vires, unlawful and arbitraryto do

so. I see no such reasons in the case at hand.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner with costs.
