Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the 6th Respondent-Appellant

(Appellant) against the Judgment of the learned District Judge of

Kegalle dated 06.10.2000 whereby the Last Will No.7 dated

28.01.1996 marked P2 at the trial was declared proved and

admitted to probate.

Both in the District Court and in this Court, the Appellant

appeared in person.

In the statement of objections dated 26.03.1998 filed before the

District Court, the Appellant, whilst praying for a declaration

that the Last Will is not an act and deed of the testator, also

prayed for exclusion of the properties under item No. 4 of the

Last Will and item No. 5 of the schedule to the petition on the

basis that the said two properties did not belong to the testator.

If the Last Will is a forgery as he claims, I cannot understand

why he seeks exclusion of some of the properties from the Last

Will. There lies, in my view, the real grievance of the Appellant.

It is interesting to note that, at the trial, the Appellant raised no

issues.

On behalf of the Petitioner-Respondent (Respondent) who is the

executor of the Last Will, two issues were raised. They are,

whether the said Last Will is an act and deed of the testator,

and, if so, whether the Letters of Administration shall be issued

in the name of the Respondent.

3

The 7th and 8th Respondents through an Attorney-at-Law filed a

statement of objections dated 26.03.1998 and prayed for

exclusion of the property described in item No. 2 of the schedule

to the petition (which is also item No. 2 of the Last Will), if the

Court decides that the Last Will is an act and deed of the

testator. It is noteworthy that the 7th and 8th Respondents did

not in the statement of objections expressly state that the Last

Will is not an act and deed of the testator or a forgery.

The 7th and 8th Respondents neither raised any issues nor cross-

examined any witness at the trial.

At the trial, on behalf of the Respondent, the Attorney-at-Law

and Notary Public who attested the Last Will has given evidence

and marked documents P1-P6 without any objection, and the

Respondents case has been closed.

Thereafter the Appellant has given evidence and closed his case

without marking any documents.

The Notary in his evidence has stated that the testator who was

a friend of him gave written instructions to prepare his Last Will

to be executed before the testator leaving Sri Lanka. The Last

Will marked P2 has been executed in the night of 28.01.1996 at

the testators house where the Notary and two other Attorneys-

at-Law have been invited for dinner, and according to the

Passport of the testator marked P6, the testator has left the

island on the following day. The aforesaid two Attorneys-at-Law

have been signed as subscribing witnesses to the Last Will. It is

the evidence of the Notary that the testator has read the Last

Will before signing and questioned the Notary about some

4

matters which he could not understand. He has stated that the

testator signed the Last Will before him and two witnesses

present at the same time. The Death Certificate marked P1 goes

to show that the testator has died more than one year and three

months after the execution of the Last Will, and the first witness

to the Last Will has been stated in P1 as the informant of the

death.

Section 4 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, No.7 of 1940,

as amended, which deals with the execution of a Last Will reads

as follows:

No will, testament, or codicil containing any devise of land

or other immovable property, or any bequest of movable

property, or for any other purpose whatsoever, shall be

valid unless it shall be in writing and executed in manner

hereinafter mentioned; (that is to say) it shall be signed at

the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some other

person in his presence and by his direction, and such

signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator in

the presence of a licensed notary public and two or more

witnesses, who shall be present at the same time and duly

attest such execution, or if no notary shall be present, then

such signature shall be made or acknowledged by the

testator in presence of five or more witnesses present at the

same time, and such witnesses shall subscribe the will in

the presence of the testator, but no form of attestation shall

be necessary.

5

The two attesting witnesses and the executor of the Last Will

have not given evidence.

The executor of the Last Will who is the Respondent is not a

beneficiary of the Last Will.

I cannot agree with the submission of the learned counsel for

the 7th and 8th Respondents that it is a mandatory requirement

in Testamentary Law to lead evidence of the propounder of the

Will. There is no such legal requirement. In order to prove a

Last Will, who shall be called to give evidence depends on facts

and circumstances of each individual case.

In the instant case, it is abundantly clear that the grievance of

the Appellant and also the 7th and 8th Respondents is that the

testator has included in the Last Will some properties which did

not belong to him. The Appellant in his evidence (at pages 132-

133 of the Brief) has clearly admitted that he is unable to state

with certainty whether or not the deceased executed the Last

Will, and the only worry he has is the deceased bequeathing the

property described in item No. 4 of the Last Will to Edward

Dirckze who is living in Spain.

As I have already stated, it is significant to note that, none of the

documents marked by the Notary in his evidence as P1-P6 has

been moved to be marked subject to proof. This includes the

affidavits of the two attesting witnesses to the Last Will marked

P4 and P5. Hence there was no necessity to call the attesting

witnesses to give oral evidence.

6

In the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned District

Judge, after trial, answered the two issues raised by the

Respondent in the affirmative and granted probate to him. It is

against that Judgment the Appellant has filed this appeal.

The Appellant for the first time in appeal challenges P4 and P5

on the basis that jurat in each of the affidavit is defective as

jurats do not say whether the deponents have sworn or affirmed

thereto. However, the deponents at the beginning of the

affidavits have stated it and it is a sufficient compliance. (De

Silva v. L.B. Finance Ltd [1993] 1 Sri LR 371)

In any event, that cannot be raised for the first time in appeal. If

the Appellant wanted, when P4 and P5 were marked in evidence,

he could have moved them to be marked subject to proof

compelling the Respondent to call the said attesting witnesses to

give oral evidence. This has not been done.

I shall also add that, it is not a must to call all the attesting

witnesses to prove a Last Will.

Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not

be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has

been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there

be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of

the court and capable of giving evidence.

It is now settled law that the Notary is an attesting witness

contemplated in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance if he knew

the executant personally. (Marian v. Jesuthasan (1956) 59 NLR

7

348, Wijegoonetilleke v. Wijegoonetilleke (1956) 60 NLR 560, The

Solicitor General v. Ava Umma (1968) 71 NLR 512) The Notary

has given clear evidence that he knew the executant personally.

The learned District Judge has believed the evidence of the

Notary.

Let me now advert to the other points raised by the Appellant in

his written submissions.

The Appellant says that the case has been filed five months and

eighteen days after the death of the testator, which delay has not

been explained. That is not, in my view, a delay which needs

special explanation.

Then the Appellant says that the Last Will does not have a

schedule but the Respondent has included a schedule in the

petition which is tantamount to a fraud. I cannot understand

how inclusion of a schedule in the petition becomes a fraud.

Although the Appellants position in the statement of objections

filed before the commencement of the trial in the District Court

was that the properties described under item No. 4 of the Last

Will and item 5 of the schedule to the petition did not belong to

the testator, in the written submissions filed before this Court,

his position is that This Appellant firmly states that the

deceased Lindon Laurie Phillip Dirckze did not own any property

mentioned in the purported subject Will. This shows the

seriousness of the Appellant on that point.

In the Petition of Appeal, the Appellants main complaint is the

failure on the part of the learned District Judge to send the Last

8

Will for a report from the Examiner of Questioned Documents

(EQD) to ascertain the genuineness of the signature of the

testator. This application has been made by the Appellant but

has not diligently pursued in that specimen signatures of the

testator have not been provided to the Court. It is the

submission of the Appellant that the Court could have taken

specimen signatures from the documents (such as proxies) filed

in other cases where the deceased testator was a party and

called for an EQD report.

The Appellant shall understand that the system of justice which

prevails in our country is not inquisitorial but adversarial and

therefore the Judge is not expected to take steps in a trial on

behalf of one party against the other in the guise of due

administration of justice. The Judge shall decide the case as it

is presented before him by two competing parties.

It was held in Pathmawathie v. Jayasekara [1997] 1 Sri LR 248:

It must always be remembered by Judges that the system

of civil law that prevails in our country is confrontational

and therefore the jurisdiction of the Judge is circumscribed

and limited to the dispute presented to him for adjudication

by the contesting parties.

Our civil law does not in any way permit the adjudicator or

judge the freedom of the wild ass to go on a voyage of

discovery and make findings as he pleases may be on what

he thinks is right or wrong, moral or immoral or what

should be the correct situation. The adjudicator or Judge is

duty bound to determine the dispute presented to him and

9

his jurisdiction is circumscribed by that dispute and no

more.

The Supreme Court in Saravanamuthu v. Packiyam [2012] 1 Sri

LR 298 observed:

It must be remembered that the jurisdiction of the Court is

limited to the dispute presented for adjudication by the

contesting parties.

In Bandaranaike v. Premadasa [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 369 at 384

Soza J. had this to say:

When we speak of the adversary or accusatorial system as

distinguished from the continental inquisitorial system, we

refer to a particular philosophy of adjudication whereby the

function of the counsel is kept distinct from that of the

Judge. It is the function of counsel to fight out his case

while the Judge keeps aloof from the thrust and parry of

the conflict. He acts merely as an impartial umpire to pass

upon objections, hold counsel to the rules of the game and

finally to select the victor. This common law contentious

procedure has its defects and has been criticised by jurists

like Roscoe Pound (see Landmarks of Law ed. Hensen-

Beacon series pp. 186, 187) but it is the Anglo American

system and prevails in India and Sri Lanka too. In fact the

Foster Advisory Committee in its Report on the English Civil

Procedure (1974) recommends the retention of the

adversary system of procedure-see the Stevens publication

of the report-chapter 5 paragraph 102 pp. 28, 29. This

system is built on the English notion of fair play and justice

10

where the Judge does not descend into the arena and so

jeopardise his impartiality. Under this system it is counsel's

duty to prove the facts essential to his case with the other

party striving to disprove these facts or to establish an

affirmative defence.

In any event, the EQD report or any expert evidence is not

decisive. The Court is not bound by the opinion expressed by

expert witness. The evidence of a handwriting expert is only a

relevant fact, which the Judge may take into account in forming

his own opinion whether the signature of the testator found in

the Last Will is genuine. (Charles De Silva v. Ariyawathie De

Silva [1987] 1 Sri LR 261)

The Appellant has found fault with the learned District Judge in

his written submissions stating that the learned District Judge

has granted reliefs not prayed for by the Respondent. He

contends that when the Respondent has sought Letters of

Administration on the Last Will, it is wrong on the part of the

Court to have issued Probate. That submission has no merit

because once the Court decides that the Last Will is proved, the

Court shall issue Probate to the executor of the Will if he is alive

and makes no objection. Court can otherwise issue Letters of

Administration with the Will annexed in the name of another if

the executor is dead or unwilling to accept that responsibility.

Plain Letters of Administration are issued to a suitable person

when there is no Last Will proved before Court. In all three

instances, the purpose is the same, which is, to administer the

estate of the deceased. In this instance, the learned District

11

Judge is correct to have issued Probate instead of Letters of

Administration on proof of the Last Will.

The main contention of the Appellant and the learned counsel

for the 7th and 8th Respondents in their written submissions is

that a person cannot effectually dispose by Will property that he

does not own, and therefore this action is unsustainable. There

cannot be any dispute that no person can effectually dispose of

others properties by way of a Will or otherwise. If one does so

by Will or any other mode of disposition, such as sale or gift, no

title would pass to the beneficiary by such disposition. As

H.N.G. Fernando J. (later C.J.) stated in Roslin Nona v. Herat

(1960) 65 CLW 55, The common law does not prevent a person

from executing a transfer of property which may, in fact, belong or

turn out to belong to another, although, of course, the transferee in

such a case acquires no title as against the true owner.

However, that does not warrant the testamentary action to be

dismissed in limine.

As the learned District Judge has rightly pointed out in the

Judgment, this is not the stage to address the Appellants and

also the 7th and 8th Respondents grievance for exclusion of the

properties from the estate of the deceased. The application of the

Appellant and the 7th and 8th Respondents is, to that extent,

premature. This is the stage to consider whether the Last Will

has been proved and can be admitted to probate.

The concern of the Appellant and the 7th and 8th Respondents

that the testator has included properties which did not belong to

him in the Last Will can be considered after the Inventory, may

12

be together with the Final Account, is tendered to Court, which

comes subsequent to the issuance of the probate.

Section 539(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

In every case where an order has been made, by a District

Court declaring any person entitled to have probate of a

deceased person's will, or administration of a deceased

person's property granted to him it shall be the duty of the

said person, executor or administrator, in whose favour

such order is made, to take within fifteen days of the

making of such order, the oath of an executor or

administrator as set out in form No. 92 in the First

Schedule, and thereafter to file in court within a period of

one month from the date of taking of the oath, an inventory

of the deceased person's property and effects, with a

valuation of the same as set out in form No. 92 in the First

Schedule and the court shall forthwith grant probate or

letters of administration, as the case may be.

It is a different question whether disputed proprietary claims

can be decided in the testamentary case itself. This Court need

not go into that matter in this appeal. The Judgment in Roslin

Nona v. Herat (supra) might, inter alia, throw some light in

deciding that matter.

It is well settled law that the onus is on the propounder of the

Will to remove all suspicious circumstances attached to the Will

and prove affirmatively that it is the Will of a free and capable

testator.

13

The learned District Judge who heard the case had been

satisfied that the said onus has satisfactorily been discharged by

the Respondent. There is no reason for this Court to take a

contrary view.

Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
