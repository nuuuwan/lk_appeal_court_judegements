The appellants along with six others were indicted in the High Court

of Hambantota for offences punishable under section 140,296 and 410

of the Penal Code. After trial the appellants were found guilty on the fourth

charge for murder and sentenced to death.

The evidence of the prosecution was that on the day of the incident

the first and fourth accused had gone to the house of the deceased in the

2

morning and had an argument which deveLoped-inte--a-figbLwithJhe-two

sons of the deceased and another friend who was in the house. Both

parties had sustained minor injuries and the first and fourth accused had

left the scene. The two sons of the deceased and the friend have gone to

the hospitals to get the wounds attended to. Witness number three

Kumudini had remained at home with another person. The deceased who

had gone out earlier had returned home and was told about the incident.

Around noon the first and fourth accused along with some others have

gone to the deceased's house and dragged her out of the house and the

first accused is alleged to have shot the deceased according to

prosecution witness number three's evidence.

The learned counsel for the appellants argued that there was no

evidence to say exactly where the first appellant was when the shooting

took place. On perusal of the evidence we find that prosecution witness

number three first says she was shot inside the house and in another

place she has said she was dragged out and shot and she does not

clearly say when and how she was shot. The counsel for the first

appellant argued that the evidence does not reveal speCifically where the

first appellant was positioned when the shooting took place. On perusal

of the evidence of prosecution witness number three and two it is not

clear where the first appellant was when the shooting took place. The

appellant's counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge misdirected

3

himself when he stated that the evidel1Caof-p[osecution.witnesS-numbe~ _

three was corroborated by prosecution witness number two and

prosecution witness number seven and prosecution witness number

eleven (p. 518). On perusal of evidence we find that prosecution witness

number three while giving evidence had contradicted her own evidence.

Prosecution witness number three and two have identified the people

who came into their house (p. 100 to 109) and (p.188-189) but have

contradicted each other on the evidence.

The learned High Court Judge has acquitted the third accused

based on the evidence of the third witness for the prosecution and on the

same breath has convicted the appellant on the evidence of the same

witness. First, sixth, seventh and eighth accused have been acquitted

without calling for their defence under section 200 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

The appellants have cited the judgments in Siriwardene and

another vs AG and Q vs Vellasamy where it has been decided that the

- tesfimony-of a witness can not be believed to convict one-accused and

disbelieved to acquit another accused.

4

-

On the charge of commolLintentiolLthe-appellanfs-counseL

submitted mere presence is not sufficient to convict an accused. In

Piyathilaka and others vs Republic of Sri Lanka (1996) 2 SLR 141,

Raju and others vs AG 2003 3 SLR 116 it has been held that common

murderous intention must be shared before a person can be convicted

for murder under section 32. In the instant case the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider the acts of participation on the part of each

one of the accused, and thereby misdirected himself.

When convicting accused on common intention the trial Judge

should consider the evidence against each accused separately and see

whether they have been acting with common murderous intention when .

the offence was committed. In the instant case when he acquitted some

of the accused the common intention failed and he has erroneously

convicted the appellants on common intention. The trial Judge failed to

evaluate the evidence of each appellant separately before coming to the

conclusion that they committed the murder with common murderous

intention. Both appellants have cited a number of judgments on common

intention which we have considered. The respondent's counsel did not ------

make any oral or written submission in support of the respondent.
