This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Horana dated 28.01.1997.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above styled action and sought a declaration of

title to the land more fully set out in the schedule to the plaint 2A 1R P26.5 in extent and the

ejectment of the Defendants therefrom. The Appellant pleaded paper title on the strength of

deeds marked P3 and P4.

The Defendants-Respondents (Respondents) denied the claim of the Appellant and stated that

they are entitled to prescriptive title to a portion of the land claimed by the Appellant which is

more fully depicted in plan no. 2345 (V3).

The learned District Judge dismissed the action of the Appellant and held that the Respondents

have prescribed to the portion of land depicted in V3 excluding the portion acquired for the road

and hence this appeal by the Appellant.

The learned counsel for the Appellant urged the following grounds in appeal:

(a) The learned District Judge failed to analyze the documentary evidence establishing

the title of the Appellant before proceeding to decide on the issue of prescription

(b) The learned District Judge erred in concluding that the Respondents had prescribed

to the land in dispute

Paper Title vs Prescriptive Title

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that when paper title and prescriptive title are

raised in relation to a land dispute the Court must first determine the paper title. The decision in

A.M. Karunadasa v. Abdul Hameed (60 N.L.R. 352) was relied on where it was held:

"in a rei vindicatio action, it is highly dangerous to adjudicate on an issue of prescription

without first going into and examining the documentary title of parties".

The learned District Judge has not disregarded the paper title of the Appellant. He has proceeded

on the basis that the Appellant has paper title to the land in dispute and that the burden is on

the Respondents to prove the prescriptive title claimed by them. This is clear upon a

consideration of the answer given to issue no. 1 where he holds that the Appellant is not the

owner of the full extent of land in dispute. If he disregarded the paper title of the Appellant there

was no need to qualify this answer to only a portion of the land in dispute. Therefore, I reject this

contention of the Appellant.

Prescriptive Title

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the learned District Judge erred in

concluding that the Respondents had prescribed to the land claimed by them. It was submitted

that the Respondents failed to discharge the burden of proof in proving prescriptive title.

Reliance was placed on the decision in Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe Udenis De Silva (52 N.L.R. 289)

where it was held that in an action for declaration of title, where the legal title is in the plaintiff,

but the property is in the possession of the defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant.

>,

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (59 N.L.R. 546 at page 548) L.W. De Silva AJ. held:

"The paper title being in the 2nd and 3rd defendants, the burden of proving a title by

prescription was on the plaintiff. That burden he has failed to discharge. Apart from the

use ofthe word possess, the witnesses called by the plaintiff did not describe the manner

of possession. Such evidence is of no value where the Court has to find a title by

prescription. On this aspect, it is sufficient to recall the observations of Bertram C. J. in

the Full Bench Case of Alwis v. Perera [1 (1919) 21 N. L. R. at 326.]:

II I wish very much that District Judges-I speak not particularly, but generally-when

a witness says 'I possessed' or 'We possessed' or 'We took the produce', would

not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but would insist on those

words being explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon the

present practice of simply recording these words when stated by the witnesses,

and would see that such facts as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in

full and appear in the record. '"'

In determining the question of prescriptive title, it is also important to bear in mind that it is a

means of defeating the paper title a party holds and in that context as Udalagama J. held in D.R.

Kiriamma v. J.A. Podibanda and 8 others (2005 B.L.J. 9 at 11):

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff."

The learned District Judge concluded that there is a house on the land claimed by the

Respondents and the two deeds P3 and P4 relied on by the Appellant does not indicate that there

is a house on the land forming the subject matter of the two deeds and that this corroborates

the version of the Respondents. In Siriyawathie v. Alwis et al [(2002) 2 SrLloR. 384] this court

considered building extensions to a house as circumstances giving rise to the presumption of

ouster.

In addition to the above ground, the learned District Judge held that the Respondents have

prescribed to the land in dispute for one or more of the following reasons:

(a) Although the Appellant sought to prove that one David Singho was residing at no. 31A as

a licensee and the father of the Respondents was residing at no. 135, there was no

evidence to indicate whether these two houses were one and the same.

(b) The Appellant did not mention any of the two residence numbers in the complaints made

to the Police and did not even refer to the number in the plaint. In fact, her evidence was

that she was not aware of the above numbers until she obtained the electoral registers.

(c) Plan V3 shows 'hik' trees which establishes that the Respondents had made a fence

separating the land to which they were claiming prescriptive title from the larger land

claimed by the Appellant on the strength of her paper title.

(d) The documents tendered on her behalf confirmed that David Singho was residing on the

land in dispute since 1960s and later the Respondents also living there since 1982 with

David Singho.

(e) No evidence was provided to establish that David Singho was a licensee.

(f) The Appellant failed to prove how she possessed the whole land claimed by her whereas

the Respondents proved how they possessed the smaller portion claimed by them.

I have given careful consideration to the evidence and the evaluation thereof by the learned

District Judge. He has correctly evaluated the evidence and concluded that the Respondents have

fulfilled the burden of proof on them in establishing prescriptive title. The facts relied on by the

learned District Judge indeed establish that the Respondents had undisturbed and uninterrupted

Page 6 of7

possession for more than ten years of the land claimed by them by title adverse to that of the

Appellant.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Horana dated 28.01.1997.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
