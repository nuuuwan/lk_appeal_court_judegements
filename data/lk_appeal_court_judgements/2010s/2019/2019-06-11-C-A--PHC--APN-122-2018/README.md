Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Police instituted these proceedings in the Magistrates Court

under section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of

1979, regarding a land dispute between two siblings, a sister and a

brother. After inquiry the Magistrates Court held with the sister

(respondent) and restored her in possession under section 68(3) of

the Act on the basis that she has been dispossessed by her brother

(appellant) within two months prior to the filing of the first

information. The High Court affirmed that order in revision. This

appeal by the appellant is against the High Court order.

The learned counsel for the appellant concedes that the

respondent who was overseas at the material time had rented out

the premises to a third party, and that third party left the premises

within two months prior to the filing of the first information in

Court.

It is the submission of the learned counsel that, the said third

party, upon being asked to leave by the appellant, left the premises

peacefully, and therefore there was no forceful dispossession or

threat to the breach of peace.

The respondent has been in possession of the premises through

the said third party, and that third party had been dispossessed by

the appellant. Although there had not been a physical fight or

resistance, the tenant was asked to leave the premises by the

appellant by returning the rent money deposited with his landlord,

the respondent. That amounts to forcible dispossession of the

respondent for the purposes of the Act. Vide Iqbal v. Majedudeen

[1999] 3 Sri LR 213. The breach of the peace is not between the

appellant and the tenant of the respondent, but between the

appellant and the respondent.

The learned counsel for the appellant also takes up the position

that there is a question regarding the identification of the

premises, i.e. whether it is 24/A or 24/1. This has never been

raised in the Magistrates Court or in the High Court. Hence the

appellant cannot raise that matter, which is purely a question of

fact, for the first time in appeal before this Court. The disputed

portion consists of two parts-one is the store room where the goods

of the respondent had been kept, and the other is the room rented

out to the third party. Vide the sketch at page 88 of the Brief. The

learned counsel for the appellant does not say that 24/A and 24/1

are two separate premises. They refer to the same premises.

According to page 2 first paragraph of the first information filed by

the police, the appellant, in his statement given to the police, has

admitted breaking open the padlock of the storeroom. The learned

counsel denies that, the appellant in his statement, made such an

admission. However, the appellant has not produced a copy of the

statement made by him to the police to disprove it. Hence Court

4

has no alternative but to accept what is stated in the first

information as correct.

The learned counsel also says that both in the first information

and in the order of the Magistrates Court, instead of section

66(1)(a), section 66(1)(b) has been mentioned. This has not caused

any prejudice to the appellant, and the learned Magistrate has

correctly applied the law into the facts of the case. Proviso to

Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree

or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. Invocation of

the jurisdiction under a wrong section does not invalidate

otherwise correct order provided the Court had the jurisdiction to

make that order.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
