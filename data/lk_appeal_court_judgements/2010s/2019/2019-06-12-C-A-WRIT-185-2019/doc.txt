Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner states that he and his father manage and operate a number of

businesses including a filling station at Sannasgama in Lellopitiya, Pelmadulla.

By a letter dated 17th October 2017 annexed to the petition marked 'P3', the

Petitioner sought the approval of the Res-pondent to establish afiUing station

--at the Madampe junction on the A17 highway on a land in extent of

-- .-- --approximately 50 perches that the Petitioner claimed he owned. The Petitioner

had submitted a formal application to the Respondent on 1st January 2018.

By a letter dated 12th June 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'PS', the

Acting Marketing Manager of the Respondent had requested the Petitioner to

produce a series of documents to establish his title to the said land, including a

copy of the Deed, a title report and an affidavit confirming that there are no

legal obstacles relating to the said land.1 This requirement had been complied

with by the Petitioner, who together with his father who co-owned the land,

submitted an affidavit annexed to the petition marked 'P6(j}' stating as

follows:

It appears from the letters dated 5th July 2018, 10th July 2018 and 9th August

2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P7', 'P8(al' and 'P8(bl' respectively, sent

2

by the Respondent to the Petitioner, that the Respondent had placed strong

emphasis on the Petitioner having a clear and unencumbered title to the land

on which the proposed filling station was to be established.

By a letter dated 9th October 2018, annexed to the petition marked 'P10', the

Rese_~ndent had informed the Petitioner that approval had been granted to

establish a dealer owned filling station on the land proposed by the Petitioner,

subject to the terms and conditions specified therein. It is observed that

specific reference had been made to the deed by which the Petitioner had

acquired the ownership of the said land in 'P10' as well.

The Petitioner claims that preparations were made to commence construction

of the filling station, and that he had ordered the storage tanks required for

the station. The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General however submitted

that the Petitioner had failed to submit plans of the proposed station for the

approval of the Respondent, as required by condition No.11 in 'P10', thereby

demonstrating that construction of the station itself has not commenced.

By a letter dated 1st February 2019 annexed to the petition marked 'P13', the

Petitioner had informed the Marketing Manager of the Respondent of the

following matters:

"enrn ~S8aS qz;6)~ ~ q~@m5 M) ~z;esK) ) C!i)() ex@~@@ ~Q@m5

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the

reference in 'P13' to litigation relates to partition action No. 5496/P filed in the

3

District Court, Pelmadulla by some persons claiming ownership to 1/6 of the

said land. He stated further that even though the Petitioner was contesting the

said action, the Hon. District Judge of Pelmadulla had initially granted an

enjoining order on 1st November 2011 and, having heard the Petitioner, had

granted an interim injunction preventing the Petitioner from engaging in any

form of clearing and construction on the said land, until the final

determination of the said action. The learned President's Counsel submitted

-further that the Petitioner had filed an application dated 18th March 2()19 in

the High Court of Civil Appeals, Ratnapura seeking leave to appeal against the

said order of the Hon. District Judge, but that the said matter is yet to be

supported.

In response to 'P13', the Respondent, by a letter dated 18th February 2019

annexed to the petition marked 'P14' had informed the Petitioner as follows:

"~Q) !)S~ es>en ~es>esS cS~>eDeCd SO~es>@d ~ee ~es fA1@Q ~d~ fA1)oen

The Petitioner states that 'P14' amounts to a cancellation of the approval

granted by 'Pl0'. Aggrieved with the said decision in 'P14', the Petitioner filed

this application, seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash 'P14', This Court must

observe at the outset that even though 'P14' has been signed by the Marketing

Manager of the Respondent, the Petitioner has not named him as a

4

Respondent to this application. It appears to this Court from the averments in

paragraphs 33 and 35 of the petition that the Petitioner has equated the

decision of the said Marketing Manager to that of the Respondent.

During the course of the oral submissions, the learned President's Counsel for

the Petitioner challenged 'P14' on three grounds. This Court would now

conSiaer each of the said grounds.

The first ground is that the Respondent had failed to give. the Petitioner a

hearing prior to issuing 'P14'. Upon a consideration of the correspondence that

was exchanged between the Petitioner and the Respondent, and more

specifically IpS', 'P6(j}', 'P7', IPSa', 'PSb' and 'P10', it is clear to this Court that

it was paramount to the Respondent that the Petitioner should have clear title

to the land. It is also clear that the unequivocal assurance given under oath by

the Petitioner that he is a co-owner of the land with his father and the fact that

his father had executed a lease in his favour influenced the decision of the

Respondent to grant approval to the Petitioner. The Petitioner is in violation of

this important requirement laid down by the Respondent, even though the

Petitioner has stated under oath in his affidavit that he had clear title to the

said land. Thus, the Petitioner himself informing the Respondent of a land

dispute and connected litigation could not have left any doubt in the mind of

the Respondent that the title of the Petitioner is encumbered, thus leaving

nothing further to be clarified by a hearing. This Court is therefore of the view

that the necessity for the Respondent to conduct an inquiry or grant the

Petitioner a hearing prior to sending 'P14' did not arise.

The second ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

is that the decision to issue 'P14' should have been taken by the Board of

Directors of the Respondent, especially since the approval in 'P10' had been

5

granted by the Board of Directors. It was the contention of the learned

President's Counsel that 'P14' had been issued by the Marketing Manager of

the Respondent, without obtaining the approval of the Board of Directors of

the Respondent, and therefore his decision in 'P14' is ultra vires his powers.

In this regard, this Court must observe that in terms of Section 58 of the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act No. 28 of 1961, as amended, the ___ !Jg~~ tc>

---- ------import, export, sell, supply or distribute petroleum products is vested with the

Respondent. In terms of Section 5E of the said Act, notwithstanding that the

exclusive right to sell, supply or distribute petroleum of any class or description

is vested in the Respondent, the Board of Directors may, from time to time, as

respects petroleum of a particular class or description grant written authority

to any person to sell, supply or distribute petroleum of that class or description

subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by such Board.

Thus, even though the approval of the Board of Directors is required for the

Petitioner to sell petroleum products, the Act does not require the approval of

the Board of Directors of the Respondent to withdraw that right.

Be that as it may, although it has been pleaded in paragraphs 33 and 35 of the

petition that the decision of the Respondent in 'P14' is arbitrary and ultra vires,

the Petitioner has not pleaded that the Marketing Manager did not have the

authority to issue 'P14' or that the Board of Directors have not approved the

said decision. The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent

submitted that the Board of Directors of the Respondent has infact approved

the decision conveyed by 'P14' and that he did not file a copy of such decision

prior to this matter being supported as this was not a fact that had been

impugned in the petition.

In this regard, this Court observes the following:

6

1) The initial application 'P3' has been addressed by the Petitioner to the

Marketing Manager;

2) It is the same Marketing Manager who wrote to the Petitioner on behalf

of the Respondent, as borne out by Ip_S', 'p7', IPSa', and '~8b';

3) The letter- dated 13th August -2018--annexed to the petition 'pgic)' has been

sent by the Petitioner to the said Marketing Manager;

4) The formal approval granted by the Respondent by 'Pl0' has authorised

the Marketing Manager to communicate with the Petitioner on its behalf;

and

5) The Petitioner himself sent 'P13' to the same Marketing Manager.

In the above circumstances, it is clear to this Court that the Marketing

Manager who issued 'p14' is not a stranger to this transaction and therefore,

this Court cannot agree with the submission of the Petitioner that the

Marketing Manager has acted ultra vires his powers when he issued 'P14'.

The final ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner is

that the approval granted by 'Pl0' is due to expire only in July 2019 and that

the Respondent has no right to withdraw the approval until then. This Court

must reiterate that the absence of a clear title to the land would by itself bring

to an end the conditional approval granted by 'Pl0'. In these circumstances,

this Court is of the view that the Respondent's decision to issue 'P14" is not

unreasonable or irrational. Furthermore, the Petitioner is yet to submit for the

approval of the Respondent, the plans of the proposed filling station, which

7

demonstrates that the Petitioner is yet to commence construction and may

not be able to compiete the construction by July 2019. This Court must also

observe that no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner, as he has been

permitted by 'P14' to submit a fresh application, once the litigation is over.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

notices on the Respondent. This application isacco-rdingly dismissed, without

costs.
