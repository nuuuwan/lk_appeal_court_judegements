Heard Counsel for the petitioner in support of the

application and the learned State Counsel in opposition.

This is an application to revise the order of the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 08.08.2013. By the said order the

suspect who had been reported to have committed or was concerned in

the commission of an offence under section 45(c) of the Immigration and

Emigration Act was refused to be enlarged on bail. When he was refused

bail the suspect had been on remand for more than a year. Significantly,

the minimum sentence, if found guilty under section 45(c) of the

Immigration and Emigration Act is one year rigorous imprisonment and

2

the maximum five years. It is to be observed that there was proof of

exceptional circumstance for the suspect to be released on bail as he

had been in incarceration for more than one year which is the minimum

custodial sentence that could be imposed on him. As at today, the

suspect has been on remand for one year and eleven months which is

equivalent to two fifth of the maximum custodial sentence that can be

imposed on the suspect. This means that if an application to the High

Court is made today, the learned High Court Judge will have no option

but to release the suspect on bail, on the basis that he had been on

remand for almost two years.

Therefore, to refer the matter back to the High Court to make

an appropriate order would prolong the agony and involves waste of

precious time of that Court and the suspect having to go through the

inquiry once again. Learned Counsel for the suspect submitted that the

suspect in this case lives in abject poverty which I understand that he

cannot afford the luxury of having to go through another bail application

in the High Court.

In the circumstances, we consider the fact of the suspect

(Wisidagamage Don Suresh) being on remand for one year and eleven

months as proof of exceptional circumstances and revise the order of the

3

learned High Court Judge dated 08th August 2013 by granting cash bail

in a sum of Rs. 10,000/= (Ten thousand Rupees) and a sum of

Rs.1 ,000,000/ =(One Million Rupees) surety bail with six sureties from

and among the family members of the suspect to be approved by the

learned Magistrate. The suspect is directed to report to the Magistrate's

Court of Negombo until 05.12.2014 on every Friday between 9.00 a.m.

and 2.00 p.m. After 05.12.2014 he is required to report to the

Magistrate's Court of Negombo, in the same manner, on the last working

day of every month. The Registrar of the Magistrate's Court is required

to maintain a separate register for the suspect to report to that Court.

An additional copy of this order to be dispatched to the

Magistrate of Negombo to give effect to the order permitting the suspect

to report to Court as laid down above.

SUNIL RAJAPAKSHE, J.
