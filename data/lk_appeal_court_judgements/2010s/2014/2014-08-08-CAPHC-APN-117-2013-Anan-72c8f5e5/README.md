Argument on: 10 February 2014

Decided on: 07 August 2014

:; ..

A.W.A.SALAM, J (PICA)

.ilr-r his application IS aimed at reVIsIng an order of the

Provincial High Court entered in the exercise of the

revisionary jurisdiction vested in it under Article 154 P(3)(b)

of the Constitution. A narrative description of the main

events preceded the instant revision application, briefly are

as follows; Proceedings began under Chapter VII of the

Primary Court Procedure Act (hereinafter r~ferred to as the

"Act"), before the learned Magistrate (who is deemed to be a

Judge of the Primary Court 1) upon a dispute referred for

adjudication under Section 66(1) (a) regarding the

obstruction of a pathway. The parties to the dispute were

three siblings. The learned Magistrate declared the parties

of the 1st part-respondents-respondents (referred to in this

judgment as the "respondents") as being entitled to use the

pathway of 17 feet in width.

Based on this decision, the learned Magistrate directed the

removal of the obstruction that was constructed across the

pathway so as to facilitate the use of it.

Discontented with the determination, the party of the 2nd

Part- Petitioner-Petitioner (referred to in the rest of this

judgment as the "petitioner") sought to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. Upon

hearing the parties as to the maintainability of the revision

1 Vide Section 57 of the Judicature Act

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

2

application, the High Court refused to entertain the same,

on the ground that the petitioner has failed to adduce

exceptional/ special grounds. The instant reVISIOn

application has been filed thereafter, with a view to have

the impugned order refusing to entertain the revision

application set aside and revised inter alia on the following

grounds.

1. The impugned refusal to entertain the reVISIOn

application is contrary to law and the facts of the case. 2. The learned High Court Judge' has failed to consider, evaluate, and give reasons for not considering or accepting as exceptional circumstances, the several matters set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the said petition. 3. No other remedies are available to the petitioner to prevent the wall being demolished although the High Court had set out as the second ground that there are other remedies available; 4. No reasons whatsoever are given in the said judgment for dismissing the revision application on the two grounds stated therein.

When an alternative remedy is available the type of restrain

imposed on the exercise of the reVISIonary powers, had

been discussed in several cases both in our Courts and

other jurisdictions. Suffice it to discuss the principle

embodied in the judgment of the well-known case of

Rustom Vs Hapangama [1978-79-80 SLR Volume IV Page

352] where it is laid down that the revisionary powers of a

Court will not be invoked, if an alternative remedy is

available, unless the existence of special circumstances are

C A PHC APN 117/2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

..

urged and established necessitating the indulgence of

Court to exercise its powers in revision.

The term 'revision' means the examination of a decision

with a view to correction. The material points that may

arise for consideration in a revision application inter alia

are whether a subordinate Court has exercised jurisdiction

which is not vested in it in law or whether it has failed to

exercise such jurisdiction which is so vested or has acted

in the exercise of the jurisdiction illegally or in excess of

jurisdiction or with material irregularity. -In other words,

strictly speaking a revision application calls for the

correction of errors concerning illegalities and patent

irregularities which are of such magnitude that call for the

discretionary powers of Court to correct them.

Hence, it is the duty of a High Court and the Court of

Appeal vested with the revisionary jurisdiction under the

Constitution, to ensure that the revisionary powers of such

Courts are not invoked as a matter of course, at the

expense of a successful party in the original Court having

to needlessly wait for the fruits of his victory to be reaped.

Inasmuch as the facts of this case are concerned, the trend

of authority not being in favour of the exercise of the

discretionary remedy unless upon the applicant showing

the existence of special circumstances warranting the

clemency of Court to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction,

the petitioner was obliged to adduce special or exceptional

\

circumstances. This is a condition precedent to entertain

the revision application by the High Court.

Similarly, as there is a right of appeal to this Court against

the refusal of the learned High Court Judge to entertain the

revision application, the petitioner has to establish

exceptional circumstances to have the impugned order

revised by this Court as well.

It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that the High

Court Judge without giving any reasons by .a judgment of

two lines refused to issue notices and dismissed the

application stating that there were no exceptional

circumstances on which its revisionary jurisdiction could

be exercised. He complains that this has culminated in a

miscarriage of justice.

On a consideration of the practice ordinarily adopted by

Courts in disposing revision applications at the threshold

stage, it is manifest that the contention raised by learned

Counsel is wholly untenable and devoid of merits. In other

words, in an order refusing to entertain an application, the

High Court Judge can most of the time able to state that

there are no exceptional circumstances that warrant the

entertainment of the application and no more. He is not

obliged to gIve details regarding the existence or

nonexistence of special or exceptional circumstances. In

passing it might be of some relevance to mention that this

is the procedure adopted even in the Supreme Court when

application for special leave is refused.

The main ground alleged in the revision application made

to the High Court was that the learned Magistrate had not

given his mind as to the proof required of the right in

question in a Section 66 matter, as the action is commonly

known. It was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that

the respondents were obliged to establish In the

Magistrate's Court the entitlement to use the pathway by

proof of user for an uninterrupted period of 10 years

adverse to the petitioner's rights. This ground alleged as a

special circumstance warranting the int~rVention of the

High Court by way of its revisionary powers should fail

in-limine as there is no requirement under Chapter VII -

Section 69 to establish the entitlement in the same manner

as is usually proved in a civil case.

The ingredients necessary to be proved to obtain a

declaration of 'entitlement' as contemplated in Section 69

of the Act will be discussed at a different stage.

On a consideration of the material available, it appears to

me that the petitioner has failed to impress upon this

Court that there are exceptional circumstances to warrant

the intervention of this Court by way of revision. Therefore,

the endeavour made by the petitioner to involve this Court

in the correction of the purported error committed by the

High Court should fail.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that a

glaring error of law has been committed by the learned

Magistrate when failing to address his mind as to whether

, ""

one brother has used the right of way over the other

brother's land adversely to the latter, and for a period of

not less than 10 years. The glaring error said to have been

committed in coming to the conclusion as to the existence

of the pathway followed by the order of demolition to

remove the impediment, according to the petitioner, has

ended up in serious miscarriage of justice.

It is elementary principle of law that under Chapter VII of

the Act, when the dispute relates to the po~session of an

immovable property, the Judge of the Primary Court IS

duty-bound under Section 68 to restrict to the issue of

actual possession as at the date of filing the information,

except where a person who was in possession of the

subject matter is dispossessed within a period of two

months immediately preceding the date on which

information under Section 66 was filed.

Unlike in the case of a dispute relating to possesslOn of

immovable property, no timeframe has been laid down as

to the length of time during which the right should have

been enjoyed in relation to the purported entitlement. In

resolving such a dispute the Judge of the Primary Court is

expected to determine as to who is entitled to the right

which is the subject of the dispute and make an order

under Section 69(2).

The marginal note to Section 69 of the Act reads as

"Determination and order of Judge of the Primary Court

when dispute is in regard to any other right". For purpose

of ready reference, Section 69 of the Act IS reproduced

below ...

(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land, other than the righ tto possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute and make an order under Sub-Section (2).

(2) An order under this Sub-Section may declare that any person specifie<;l therein shall be entitled to any such right.in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as may be specified in the order until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent Court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference with the exercise of such right by such party other than under the authority of an order or decree as aforesaid.

The question that arises for determination at this stage is

whether a party claiming a right to any land other than the

right to possession should establish his Jjght precisely as

he is expected to do in a civil case or whether he could

succeed in obtaining the declaration as contemplated in

Section 69, merely by proving that he enjoyed the right as

at the time when the dispute arose. It is to be understood

that the proof of the acquisition of the right is totally

different from proving the enjoyment/existence of the right

at the time the dispute arose.

In dealing with the nature of the right, a Judge of the

Primary Court is expected to adjudicate under Section 69

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

8

of the Act, Sharvananda, J (later Chief Justice) in the case

of Ramalingam Vs Thangarajaha 1982 Sri Lanka Law

Reports - Volume 2 , Page - 693 stated that in a dispute in

regard to any right to any land other than right of

possession of such land, the question for decision,

according to Section 69( 1), is who is entitled to the right

which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle" here

connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to

determine which of the parties has acquired that right or IS

ENTITLED FOR THE TIME BEING TO EXERCISE THAT

RIGHT. In contradistinction to Section 68 of the Act,

Section 69 requires the Court to determine the question as

to which party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary

to the making of an order under Section 69(2).

(Capitalization is mine)

According to the decision in Ramalingam (supra) the Judge

of the Primary Court has two options, in deciding as to

which of the parties should be declared entitled to the

right. Since the word "entitle" as used in Section 69

implies ownership of the right, the Judge of the Primary

Court could determine as to who in fact has acquired the

disputed right. In the larger sense it means any kind of

proof of the acquisition of the disputed right as envisaged

by any law dealing with the ingredients to be proved. For

instance, if the disputed right is the existence of a right of

way, the party who desires the Court to pronounce his

entitlement may establish the uninterrupted and

undisturbed use of the pathway, by a title adverse to or

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

9

independent of the owner that is to say, a use of the

pathway unaccompanied by any payment from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person

would fairly and naturally be inferred for ten years previous

to the filing of the information under Section 66 of the Act.

This may not be possible in every case relating to a dispute

over a right concerning an immovable property, as the

proceedings under Chapter VII of the Act is required to be

held in a summary manner, concluded. within three

months of the commencement of the inquiry and the order

under Section 68 or 69 as the case may be, having to be

delivered within one week of the conclusion of the inquiry.

Further, under Section 72 of the Act before the

pronouncement of the order, the material on which the

Judge of the Primary Court may act are limited to certain

types of material unlike in a civil case where parties have

the option to lead evidence of any volume as long as it is

admissible and relevant to the facts in issue and facts

relevan t to the facts in issue.

It is now trite law that in an inquiry under Chapter VII of

the Act, adducing evidence by way of affidavits and

documents is the rule and oral testimony is an exception to

be permitted only at the discretion of the Judge. The

discretion is hardly exercised to permit oral testimony and

generally not granted as a matter of course. In such an

instance it is not only impracticable but beyond the ability

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

10

of a party to establish a right as is usually accomplished in

a civil Court under the regular procedure.

Although in certain limited number of disputes, a party

may be able to e&tablish the right he claims strictly in

accordance with the substantial law, in a large number of

cases they may not be able to do so, by reason of the

limited time frame within which the inquiry has to be

concluded, the restricted mode of proof and the sui generis

nature of the procedure.

There are two ways in which an entitlement can be proved

in the Primary Court. They are ...

1. By adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a

civil Court.

2. By offering proof that he is entitled to the right FOR

THE TIME BEING.

The phrase "for the time being" as used in the decision in

Ramalingam's case connotes the exercise of right by one

party, temporarily or for the moment until such time such

person is deprived of his right by virtue of a judgment of a

Court of competent jurisdiction. If you describe a party as

being entitled to enjoy a right but for the time being, it

means that it will be like that for a period of time, but may

change in the future. This is exactly in keeping with

legislative wisdom embodied under part VII of the Act.

The rationale behind this principle is that the conferment

of the special jurisdiction on a Judge of the Primary Court

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

11

under Chapter VII of the Act is quasi -criminal in nature

and is intended to facilitate the temporary settlement of the

dispute between the parties so as to maintain the status

quo until the rights of the parties are decided by a

competent civil Court. Subject to this, every other

concerns however much prominent they may appear to be,

will have to be placed next to the imperative necessity of

preserving the peace.

As has been emphasised in the case of Ramalingam (supra)

at an inquiry under Chapter VII, the action taken by the

Judge of the Primary Court is of a purely preventive and

provisional nature, pending the final adjudication of the

rights of the parties in a civil Court and the proceedings

under this Section are of a summary nature. Moreover, it is

essential that they should be disposed of as expeditiously

as possible. In the circumstances, although it is open to a

party to prove the right he claims to be entitled to as is

required under the substantial law dealing with a

particular right, it is not impossible for him to be content

with adducing proof to the effect that he has the right to

enjoy the entitlement in dispute for the time being.

Even in a civil action when the plaintiff had failed to prove

a clear case of servitude there had been instances where

the Courts have issued restraining orders against the right

of way being obstructed. One such case is Perera Vs.

Gunatilleke where Bonsor C. J, observed as follows:

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

12

"It seems to me that, where a person establishes

that he has used a way as of right openly and

continuously for a long period and is forcibly

prevented from using it, he is entitled to an

injunction to restore him to the quasi possession of

the way, irrespective of whether he can establish

the existence of a servitude. We will treat this

action as a possessory action and grant an

injunction which will restore the status quo ante"

[4 NLR 181]

Historically, unlike In India which introduced laws to

combat the breach of the peace arising from disputes

relating to immovable properties very early, the Magistrates

here did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate over such

disputes until recently. As it was unaffordable to permit

violence in the name of civil disputes which generally

culminates in the devastation of the progress of a nation,

the bench and the bar had continued to clamour for Laws

to be introduced to meet the challenges.

In 1953 the Criminal Courts Commission headed by E F N

Gratian (Chairman) and M S F Pulle (Commissioner)

accompanied by its Secretary M C Sansony 2 forwarded its

report to His Excellency the Governor suggesting that

changes be brought into the law to put an end to this

menace.

2 All of them adorned the Supreme Court

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32 13

13

tt .' f1

The suggestions made by the commission with regard to

disputes affecting lands, resulting in the breach of the

peace are found at page 8 and 9 of the report. The

suggestion made by the Criminal Courts Commission was

to strengthen the hands of the Magistrates to adjudicate

summarily on disputes affecting land where the breach of

the peace is threatened or likely and to permit the

enjoyment of the rights relating to lands to those who are

entitled to enjoy them FOR THE TIME BEING.

It took almost two decades to pass Laws in terms of the

suggestion made by the Criminal Courts Commission,

when the National State Assembly in 1973 made Provisions

by enacting law No 44 of 1973 with the inclusion of Section

62 which was later replaced by Act No 44 of 1979 (Vide

Chapter VII).

As the original Provision of Section 62 In the

Administration of Justice Law was based on the report of

the Criminal Courts Commission, it is pertinent at this

stage to reproduce the relevant passages from the said

report concerning the suggestions made with regard to

disputes affecting immovable properties. For purpose of

ready reference the suggestions made by the commission

are reproduced below ...

"Dispute as to immovable property

C A PHC APN 117/2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

14

10. Many disputes and resulting offences spring from

rival claims to land. There is at present no method by

which a Magistrate can deal speedily and summarily

such disputes. It is essential that the Magistrate should

be vested with statutory powers to make orders with

regard to the possession of lands where disputes

affecting such lands may result in a breach of the

peace. The procedure suggested by us in Section 98 A

is based in part on the provisions of Section 145 of the

Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. A~. far as possible,

notice will be given to the parties alleged to be

concerned in the dispute, but whether such notice

reaches the parties or not the Magistrate will hold

summary inquiry and may, even before the inquiry is

concluded, make an interim order on the question of

possession in order to maintain the peace. The purpose

of the inquiry is to enable the Magistrate to determine in

a summary manner who should FOR THE TIME BEING

permitted to enjoy the right in dispute, but he will make

an order which may not be founded strictly on the legal

merits of the claim of the rival parties but rather with

the view to the necessities of the immediate emergency.

It will be directed rather to resorting to the status quo

and to ensure that interference, except by due process

of law, which possession does not give rise to a breach

of the peace. The ultimate decision as to the legal right

of the parties will necessarily have to be made, in

subsequent proceedings, by a competent civil Court. No

C A PHC APN 117/2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

15

particular procedure has been prescribed in regard to

the manner of holding the inquiry, for that would only

have introduced technicalities. The order eventually

made by the Magistrate will be purely a temporary one

and a refusal to comply with it in breach of it is made

punishable. [Capitalisation added]

11. We have sought to give effect to the principle that

parties should not take the law in to the.ir own hands.

Therefore, any party who dispossesses' another forcibly

should not gain any advantage thereby, when the

Magistrate makes his final order. The scope of the

Section has been deliberately made as wide as possible

in order to embrace all possible disputes concerning any

rights affecting land, and the intention is that in making

an equitable interim order, a Magistrate is empowered

to order a party placed in possession FOR THE TIME

BEING to furnish security for t~e purpose of complying

with the final decision of the dispute". [Capitalisation

added]

From the above report, it would be seen that the

commission has given the highest priority to orders being

made FOR THE TIME BEING, permitting those who enjoy

the rights to continue with it, until such time the Court of

competent jurisdiction resolves the dispute on a permanent

basis.

C A PHC APN 117/2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

16

Insistence on the proof of a right as in the case of a civil

dispute, in this type of proceedings, would lead to two

original Courts having to resolve the identical dispute on

the same evidence, identical standard of proof and

quantum of proof twice over. This would indeed an

unnecessary duplicity and is not the scheme suggested by

the Criminal Courts Commission and could neither be the

intention of the Legislature.

One has to be mindful of the fact that there are still judicial

officers in this country who function simultaneously as

Judges of the Primary Court, Magistrates, and Judges of

the Juvenile Court, Judges of the family Court and District

Judges. If disputes affecting lands under the Primary Court

Procedure Act are to be heard by the Primary Court Judges

and later the civil case as District Judges on the same

evidence, same standard of proof and identical quantum of

proof, it would not only result in the utter wastage of the

precious time of the suitors and the Courts but will be a

meaningless exercise as well.

Turning to the determination, the learned Magistrate has

addressed his mind to the averments in the affidavits of

both parties and considered the documents annexed and

given cogent reasons for his findings. In short, the findings

of the learned Magistrate are quite logical, stand to reasons

and consistent with the material available. He has referred

to the petitioner as having stated at the inspection that the

respondents used the pathway in question as permissive

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

17

users. As a result, the parties in the Magistrate's Court

were at variance only as to the nature of the pathway and

not whether the respondents used the pathway. There is

thus an implied admission of the road having been used by

the respondents. Therefore the issue is whether the

pathway used by the respondents is a right of servitude or

a merely permissive user in nature. The wall has been put

up overnight to obstruct the pathway.

In the Primary Court Procedure Act under Section 75 a

dispute is defined as follows ...

" dispute affecting land includes any dispute as to

the right to the possession of any land or part of a

land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries

thereof or as to the right to cultivate any land or

part of a land, or as to the right to the crops or

produce of any land, or part of a land, or as to any

right in the nature of a servitude affecting the

land and any reference to " land" in this Part

includes a reference to any building standing

thereon. (Emphasis added)

In the case of Kandiah Sellappah V s Sinnakkuddy

Masilamany (CA application 425/80- C A. minute dated 18

March 1981, Abdul Cader, J with the concurrence of Victor

Perera, J held inter alia that the claimant of a footpath who

started using it in 1966 August and was obstructed a few

months before the prescriptive period of 10 years, in June

1976 was not entitled to a declaration under section 69.

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HCRA 32/13

18 '

Having analysed the evidence led in the lower court his

Lordship formed the opinion that there had been no

satisfactory evidence on which it can be held that the

claimant exercised a right which has been in continuous

existence for a period of time prior to his use.

I am of the view that the decision in Kandiah Sellappah's

case has been entered per incuriam without properly

defining or appreciating that all what section 76 mandates

is "a dispute in the nature of a servitude" and not a dispute

touching upon a servitude per se. Therefore, when the right

concerned is in the nature of a servitude relating to a right

of a pathway, the period of 10 years plays no important

role.

Further, the answer to this issue is found in the Judicature

Act No 2 of 1978 by which the primary court had been

created. In terms of section 32 (2) of the Judicature Act the

primary court shall have no jurisdiction in respect of the

disputes referred to in the 4th schedule, irrespective of the

value thereof. According to the 4th schedule the actions

excluded from the jurisdiction of the primary court inter

alia are as follows ..

12. Any action for a declaratory decree including a

decree for the declaration of title to a land.

24 (i) for obstruction to or interference with the

enjoyment of any servitude or the exercise of any

right over property.

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HeRA 32 13

19

The two exclusions referred to above provide clear

authority for the proposition that the right intended to be

declared under section 69 is definitely not with the regard

to servitude per se but a right in the nature of a servitude.

Since the dispute in this case therefore is a right connected

with land in the nature of servitude there is no doubt that

the learned Magistrate had jurisdiction to adjudicate on the

issue in terms of the Act.

He also had jurisdiction to order the demolition of the

construction that obstructed the pathway. In Tudor Vs.

Anulawathie and Others - 1999 - Sri Lanka Law Reports

Volume 3, Page No - 235 it was decided that although there

is no specific Provision in the Primary Courts I Procedure

Act, expressly enabling the Court to order removal of

obstructions in the way of restoration of the right to the

person entitled thereto in terms of the determination made

by the Court, there is no such prohibition, against the

Court exercising such a power or making such an order ..

As was held in Narasingh v. Mangal Dubey - (1883) 5

Allahabad 163, the Courts are not to act on the principle

that every procedure is to be taken as prohibited unless it

is expressly provided for by law. What in fact matters here

is the converse that every procedure is to be understood as

permissible till it is shown to be prohibited. As such, I can

see no reason as to how the order of demolition made by

the learned magistrate can be faulted as being illegal. It

C A PHC APN 117 2013 HC Galle HeRA 32/13

'"-..

20

axiomatic wisdom that prohibitions are generally not

presumed and therefore a court cannot be faulted for

acting on the converse.

The photograph produced marked as 2D9b, by the

petitioner has been observed by the Magistrate as an

attempt to mislead Court with regard to certain important

features of the subject matter.

According to the affidavit of the Postmaster of the relevant

area, following the construction of the: wall, postal

authorities had experienced difficulties in delivering the

mails, addressed to the respondents.

Further, the affidavit of the sister of both parties bears

testimony that the pathway had existed over a period of 40

years servIng as access road / to buildings bearing

assessment No's 195/1 and 195/2.

According to the affidavit of the Grama Niladhari the

pathway in question had been used for a period of 50 years

as access to the aforesaid buildings.

In addition, a lawyer practising in Galle and a SCIence

teacher had affirmed severally that the right of way had

been used over a period of time.

The employees of the respondents also have affirmed to the

existence of the road in question. Further, certain others

who had used the pathway also had given affidavits.

Upon a consideration of the material referred to in Section

72 of the Act, the learned Magistrate has formed the

:t:.,

21

ti I! ! I [

j i !! I III

I \ ! I opinion that the respondents are entitled to use the said

pathway. This being a finding based on the credibility of

the witnesses and parties, I do not think the High Court

Judge or this Court should interfere with it, as the law

permits the reversal of such a strong finding only if it had

ended up in a miscarriage or travesty of justice. No such

eventualities appear to have taken place by reason of the

magisterial determination.

By placing a permanent obstruction In a haste, with no

justification or explanation warranting such a quick action,

carried into effect over a weekend, the petitioners appear to

have aimed at making the respondents unable to tum to

Court for redress, a compelling reason that had influenced

the Magistrate to look for a draconic measure to undo the

damage.

I feel obliged here to reiterate the concern of Bonser CJ

penned over a century and a decade ago (4 NLR 181) which

needs to re-echo in the minds of every officer exercising

judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative powers. in

resolving or investigating into a complaint touching upon

the breach or apprehension of a breach of the peace

emanating from a dispute affecting land. It reads as

follows ...

Illn a Country like this, any aHempt of parties to use

force in the maintenance of their rights should be

promptly discouraged. Slight brawls readily blossom

into riots with grievous hurt and murder as the fruits.

It is, therefore, all the more necessary that Courts

BONSER CJ- Perera Vs. Gunathilake (1900 - 4

N.L.R 181 at 183)

In conclusion, I wish to place it on record that land

disputes can cause social disruption and sometimes loss of

life. They can have a negative impact on the development of

lands and eventually on the economy of the Country. An

efficient and effective system for settling land disputes is

essential in any Country although the resolution of land

disputes may appear to be complex. However trivial the

dispute may be, it is the duty of the law enforcing

authorities to pay senous attention to the Issue,

particularly with a view to take a preventive measure

against possible violence. The determination of the learned

Magistrate points to a right decision taken at the right time

in the best interest of the parties, in consistent with the

Law and the Legislative aim. Any decision to overturn such

a decision by the High Court would have ended up in a

miscarriage of justice.

Hence, it would be seen that the petitioner has failed to

adduce exceptional circumstances or made out a case

deserving the exercise of the revisionary powers of this

Court under Article 138 of the Constitution.

He has neither unfolded a case deserving the intervention

of the Provincial High Court by way of revision under

Article 154 (3) (b) of the Constitution. In the circumstances,

the fate of the petition could not have been different from

how it culminated in the High Court.

Hence, the Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

are amply justified _ in their respective conclusions which

effectively had prevented the petitioner from taking the law

into his own hands. The decision allowing the respondents

to continue to enjoy the disputed right in the nature of a

servitude for the time being, is the only order that could

have been lawfully made by the Magistrate.

Revision application is therefore dismissed subject to costs

fixed at Rs 1,03,000/-.
