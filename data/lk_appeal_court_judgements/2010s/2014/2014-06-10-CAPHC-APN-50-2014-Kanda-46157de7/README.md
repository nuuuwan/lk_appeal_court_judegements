*************

Heard Counsel in support of the application and we do not see

any merits in this application for notice to be issued as the learned High Court

Judge has correctly interpreted the law against the petitioner not to release

the suspect on bail pending appeal as she had failed to establish any

exceptional circumstances.

Notice refused.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SUNIL RAJAPAKSHE, J.

I agree.
