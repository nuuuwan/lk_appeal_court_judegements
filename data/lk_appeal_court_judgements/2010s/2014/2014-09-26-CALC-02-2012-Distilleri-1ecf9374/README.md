This is an appeal to this court from the order of the Lands Acquisition

of Board of Review pronounced on or about November 2011 affirming the

award of the Acquiring Officer. The Section 7 notice under the Land Acquisition

Act was published on 19.7.1996. The award for compensation under Section

17 of the said Act was made in favour of the Appellant, the Ceylon Distilleries

3

Corporation, in a sum of Rs. 40 million. The extent of the property acquired is

about 1 Acre, 2 Roods and 5.182 Perches, situated at No. 418 Sirimavo

Bandaranaike Mawatha, Katukele, Peradeniya Road, Kandy.

The land in question is shown in Survey General's plan P.P

4123/Maha comprises of 8 lots adding up to the above extent. Appellant

describes that the access to the property is from a 20 feet wide road branching

off from the main Peradeniya Road. Appellant explains further by adding that

the land is situated in a very prestigious area, within the city of Kandy, and

commercial activity takes place within this area. Infrastructure facilities as

electricity, water, telecommunication and scavenging services are readily

available.

I would also refer to the claims of the appellant as described in the

written submissions of Appellant.

1. Before the Respondent, Acquisition Officer the Appellant made a claim for

compensation under the following three heads, aggregating to a total sum of Rs.

411,209.064.19

(this figure was subsequently amended and reduced to Rs. 128,117,227/69)

(i) land and buildings as per the Valuation Report of - Rs. 172,208,100.00

Mr. B.l. Ariyatillake, Former Chief Valuer

(ii) loss of earnings - Rs. 230,194,782.00

(iii) Expenses of relocation - Rs. 8,806,182.19

2. However the award made by the Respondent under section 17 of the Act, was for a

sum of Rs. 40 million without disclosing any basis or a mode of calculation.

The Board of Review order no doubt gives a description of various

matters which are not so connected to its task. i.e to praise and

congratulate some persons described therein etc. I would for convenience

refer only to those parts of the order of the Board connecting the claim of

the Appellant as follows, and in the order it is stated that the Appellant

before the Acquiring Officer had a staggering claim as;

(1) Land and building

(2) Loss of business

(3) Charge of residence

Rs. 172,208,100/-

Rs. 230,194,782/-

Rs. 8,806,182,69/-

It is also stated that the Appellant modified the claim as follows

before the Board.

(1) Land and building

(2) Loss of business

(3) Change of residence

Rs. 90,450,000/-

Rs. 26,653,104/-

Rs. 8,806,182/69

The Board of Review order at pg. 4 gives another calculation.

The valuation at privatization.

1991 figures .... total -

Rs. 18,620,000/-

Rs. 4,370,000/-

Rs. 17,900,000/-

Rs. 40,890,000/-=============

I would as far as possible attempt to gather some points from the

order which attempts to show its importance, to this appeal, as follows.

(a) Appellant at the time of acquisition, had the benefit of receiving

Government land, short distance from the present location at a

concessionary price. To this extent there was no loss of business, despite 36

days closure of one plant. Material furnished on loss of business not

convincing.

(b) The two parties had cited four sales each and cross-examination revealed

several flaws. In the final analysis valuation of the State is a realistic

valuation

(c) A striking revelation is that at the time the acquisition of the land had not

been transferred to the Appellant company. In fact, the ownership was in

State lands here and the State is conceding to the Company of the

Appellant a sum of Rs. 40,000,000/- for something that did not belong to

the company. The history reveals a possible clue to this grave omission. The

Kandy warehouse and plant was originally commenced by the State in a

Katukele location wherein the Excise Unit of the State was standing right

next to the Excise Office.

The learned President's Counsel who appeared for the

Appellant at the outset of his oral submissions, with reference to the Board

of Review Order, (590) made the following remarks.

1. Market value of property not properly ascertained.

2. Loss of profit not considered.

3. Expenses of relocation not considered

4. The order of the Board of Review lacks in proper reasoning

5. Market prices of other lands in the vicinity not considered.

6. Valuation by Government Valuer was by R16, R17 & R1B. Board has

completely ignored R17 and R1B.

7. As regards the entitlement of compensation as per the statute, the

following Section namely Sections 5(1), 46{i) and (iii) & 46(1)(v) has not

been considered by the Board.

I would also refer to the points urged by the Appellant in their attempt

to get enhanced compensation. It is stated that the Appellant relies on the

evidence of Mr. Kaleel (Valuer). Particulars of comparable sales of similar large

extents of land were not available, as such he relies on smaller extents of 2 -

15 perches, and shown in plan Ie' as lots 1 - 4. It is stated that Mr. Kaleel has

projected an actual value of Rs. 6,000.000/- per perch in 1996. It is stated that

[ I IIIIi I I i,

f I I !I t !

f, I! t t f Ii ! ! t ? ! t !

I I I ! I

a Notional Development method should be adopted due to non-availability of

sales of large extents. Therefore the final value of the land and building valued

at Rs. 92,567,942/= (Rs. 377,914 per perch) in keeping with the comparable

method. In the written submissions it is stated that the State Valuer Mr.

Hennbanda relied on the development method since there were no larger

lands in the locality.

The Respondent's rely on the development method as in R 16A and

an award of Rs. 40 M. Calculation in R16, value the land at Rs. 100,000,00 per

perch based on the existing use value ascertained based on schedules of sales

of similar lands as at 19.7.1996 (schedule of sale marked R2). Building valued

at Rs. 7,118,815.00 after depreciation. Consequently the compensation

payable for the said land and buildings had been valued at Rs. 31,650,000.00.

To this amount the compensation for loss of business and change of residence

as in R17 & R18 had been added. Total being Rs. 37.4 M.

Appeals to this court on question of law has made certain limitation

in Section 28(5) of the Land Acquisition Act. The said section reads thus:

Every appeal to the Court of Appeal under this section shall be heard and determined by

any two Judges of that court. On determining the question of law on which an appeal is

made to the Court of Appeal under this section, that court shall, in accordance with its

decision on such question, confirm, reduce or increase the amount of compensation which

i

has been confirmed or determined by the board's decision against which that appeal has

been preferred

Provided that the Court of Appeal shall not allow as compensation to any person an

amount which exceeds the amount of the claim for compensation which he had originally

notified to the acquiring officer who made the award under section 17 in respect of the land

or servitude to which that claim relates.

This court is not mandated to quash or set aside the decision of the

Board of Review. We could confirm, reduce or increase the compensation

awarded by the Board. This seems to be the legislative intention of Parliament,

based on a question of law. The petition dated 22.12.2011, filed by the

Appellant refer to several questions of law, in para 17 of the said petition.

Almost 11 questions of law are suggested. I observe that some of these are

certainlv not questions of law. I have already stated in this judgment that the

Board of Review has given its mind to certain extraneous matters instead of

concentrating mainly on the question of compensation as per the statute.

When I examine documentation submitted by both sides, I cannot

accept the contention of the Appellants as regards the valuation suggested by

witness Kaleel based on a Notional Development plan 'F'. I agree with the

contention of the state that the Appellant's witness relies on hypothetical and

1

J I

unrealistic facts and figures, except in the valuation supporting change of

residence. This court is inclined to accept, figures contained in the entirety of

document R16, as regards land and building and the loss of business (as in

R17). However on the question of change of residence it appears that there is

some substance in the material furnished by the Appellant's party. One Mr.

Koliths Jagath Kahanda testified as regards the liquor production process, and

his evidence reveal that same is monitored by the Excise Department. The

takeover of land necessitated the shifting of plants and machinery within 36.5

working days.

The documents as regards shifting XS to X14 and X2S, X16 & X17

being invoices are documents and invoices issued by Stassen Exports Ltd. The

challenge to these invoices on the basis of close link with Appellant need to

have been probed properly and mere suggestions would not be a basis to

reject such a claim. There cannot be a deliberate delay in shifting and some of

the points of attack by the Respondent should not have been tolerated at the

inquiry, unless valid acceptable proof was placed before the Board. Therefore

the Appellant claim on account of shifting is justified in the circumstances of

this case. As such the expenses for relocation in a sum of Rs. 8,806,181.69

claimed by Appellant need to be added to the claim. In brief the method of

I

10

calculation and adopted by the Respondent on account of the value for land

and building and loss of business are confirmed by this court, and as observed

above a sum of Rs. 8,806,181.69 claimed by Appellant on account of change of

residence should be added to the above two components. The figure

acceptable to this court are as follows:

Land and building

Loss of business

Cost of shifting or change of

residence

Rs. 31,650,000.00

Rs. 4,400,000.00

Rs. 8,806,181.00

Rs. 44,856,181.00 ===============

Whatever method chosen, by the parties concerned must be in

accord with Section 45 and 46 of the Lands Acquisition Act. Calculations are no

doubt based on certain accepted valuation methods of land and building. The

said sections in a gist contemplate of the market value as at the date of the

Section 7 notice which also entitles to be added to the compensation whatever

sums of money due on loss of earnings and change of residence. Law also does

not contemplate to make an award over and above the claim made by the

Appellants before the Acquiring Officer. This court would enhance the

compensation according to the above stated sum of Rs. 44,856,181.00. It is

I I I ! If [ t !

I

,

11

desirable to make it a round figure of Rs. 45 million {difference being only Rs.

143,818.31}. Thus the compensation awarded by the Board of Review is

enhanced or increases by a sum of Rs. 5 million, giving credit to the claim of

the Appellant only on account of change of residence.

Subject to above, appeal allowed. Compensation enhanced.
