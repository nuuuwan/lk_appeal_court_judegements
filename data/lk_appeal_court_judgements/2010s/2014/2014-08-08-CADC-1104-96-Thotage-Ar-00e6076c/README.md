This is a partition action. The judgment and the interlocutory

decree impugned in this appeal are dated 21.06.1996. The learned

District Judge having decided that the parties should be allotted

undivided shares failed to give exactly the shares each party will

entitled to in the judgment. The learned District Judge in that judgment

states without specifying the undivided rights of the parties that the

plaintiff should tender a schedule of shares and if the schedule of

shares so tendered IS consistent with the judgment it should be

accepted as part and parcel of his judgment.

This judgment of the learned District Judge is totally

violative of the provisions of the partition law. The judgment in the

strict sense of the law cannot be regarded as a proper judgment in

view of the direction given by the learned District Judge that the

schedule of shares directed to be tendered by the plaintiff should be

accepted as part and parcel of his judgment. This being plainly

obnoxious to the provisions of the partition law I have no alternative

but to hold that the learned District Judge has failed to discharge the

elementary duty of discharging the most important aspect in the case. It is

settled law that in a partition action the trial judge must decide the

nature and extent of the interest each party is entitled to upon an

examination of the title in terms of Section 25 of the Partition Law.

In c. A .. 116 and 1167/96(F) it was held that the failure of

the District Judge to indicate the undivided interest of each party in

the interlocutory decree is a fatal irregularity which gives rights to the

judgment and interlocutory decree having to be set aside. It is appropriate

at this stage to refer to the decision III Memanis V sEide 59 Ceylon

Law at page 46. HIL Basnayake, C.l. with H.N.G. Fernando concurring

laid down the proposition that it is imperative to include the undivided

interest of each party in the interlocutory decree. The relevant passage

of the said judgment is quoted below.

"In his judgement the learned that district judge says;

''plaintiff's proctor will file a schedule of shares which

when filed will form part and parcel of this judgement"

and there is a schedule of shares filed which he has

adopted in entering the interlocutory decree. Section 25 of

the Partition Act, provides that the judge shall examine the

title of each party and shall hear and receive evidence in

support thereof and shall try and determine all questions

of law and fact arising in that action in regard to the

right, share or interest of each party to, of, or in the land

to which that action relates, and shall consider and decide

which of the orders mentioned in section 26 shauld be

made. In the instant case there has been no determination

of the shares of the parties as required by the Partition

Act. It is the shares so determined by the judge that the

court is required to enter in the interlocutory decree. The

course taken by the learned district judge is contrary to

the provisions of section 26 of the partition act. "

Based on the above two decision I am of the VIew

that the impugned judgement cannot be allowed to stand as it IS totally

inconsistent with the prOVISIOns of the partition law.

In the circumstances the impugned judgment IS set

aside and the case send back for re-trial.
