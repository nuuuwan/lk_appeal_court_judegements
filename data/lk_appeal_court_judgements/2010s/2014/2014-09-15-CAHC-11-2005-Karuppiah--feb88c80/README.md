We regret our inability to have this appeal disposed of earlier than this.

The delay in the disposal of this appeal had resulted in the accused (a

lady with 2 small children at that time) having to be in incarceration for

nearly 9 years awaiting the outcome of her appeal. If she had electei to ,,/

a~~ ct serve the sentence, probably she might have served the sentenc'A founa

her way out of the prison. This clearly shows the shortcoming of our

system of administration, particularly in regard to the disposal of

criminal appeals, which undoubtedly has had the effect of undermining

the liberty of the subjects and the right of citizens to have justice

meted out without delay. This is a classic case to illustrate the legal

maxim that justice delayed is justice denied.

The meaning of the maxim is that that if legal redress is available for a

party who has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in an

expeditious manner, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all.

This principle is the basis for the right to a speedy trial, because it is

unfair for a party to have sustained an injury and await the resolution

with little or no hope.

Nevertheless, it is my fervent hope that the accused will find solace in

the fact that she was instrumental in contributing to the thought at the

expense of her liberty, to have at least two divisions to deal with

criminal appeals in this Court. In my own small way to contribute

towards the elimination of such a recurrence, as the President of the

Court of Appeal, I have with the fullest cooperation of other Judges

decided to constitute another division in this court to hear and dispose

of the criminal appeals preferred against the decisions of the High

Courts exercising original criminal jurisdiction, and that court had

started functioning from yesterday.

Turning to the appeal preferred, at the trial two witnesses gave

evidence a~fi nst the accused. They were Priyantha Liyanage, I. P and his

sUbordinat~ police Sergeant by the name Senaratna. According to the

prosecution witnesses, upon receipt of information of trafficking of

heroin in a house, through a private informant of R.I.P Basnayaka of the

Police Narcotics Bureau, on 17 December 1998 IP .. Liyanage and his team

had proceeded to a place called Kimbulaela.

The version of the two main prosecution witnesses is that they visited

the area in question and upon the informant pointing out a house they

went up to the same. They observed that there was only one female in

the house who was seated at the rear door. The testimony of the

prosecution witnesses in summary was that upon their arrival at that

house, the lady who was seated got up and went into a room and

thereafter attempted to walk away with a silver colour box containing

heroin and she was arrested and taken to the police.

One of the grounds of appeal urged was the failure on the part of the

learned Judge of the High Court to consider the improbabilities of the

version of the prosecution. It is pertinent at this stage to consider the

chain of events that had taken place prior to the arrest of the accused.

According to the prosecution, the information has been received with

regard to the trafficking of heroin at a place called Kimbulaela. The

informant had been employed by a reserve police sub inspector by the

tit!llfj..1II'j,=gtmj1Ditl.I,J$iiil 'mjl:mi1m*;iB;'~{4.,@.t'mnl'a;.'io);'[4.'@'U

name Basnayaka. A pOl~cteam led by Inspector of Police Uyanage

consisting of 19 Offic~S including 3 police drivers had travelled 5

kilometers or more to reach the house of the accused in 3 vehicles. The

informant had pOinted out a particular house painted with pink colour

and left the place. The 2 witnesses had gone to the house as pointed

out by the informant while the other police officers and the vehicles

were faraway.

When the witnesses approached the house of ,the accused, she was

seated on the floor and having seen them went into a room, and

thereafter was trying to escape with a nickel coloured box in which the

prosecution claimed there was heroin. The story of the prosecution is in

many ways improbable. In the first instance, taking the evidence of the

prosecution as a whole, the testimony with regard to the raid conducted

does not inspire confidence. Though the legal proposition points to such

evidence not strictly requires corroboration, in the singular facts and

circumstances of the present case, having regard to the quality of the

version of the prosecution about the incident, it cannot be safely relied

upon to sustain the conviction against the accused for multifaceted

reasons.

Initially, it is highly improbable to have left out Basnayaka 51 who had

received the information through his personal informer from taking part

at the raid. The informant had only pointed out a particular house in a

row of houses and whether the police officers had in fact went into that

particular house is not confirmed as the informant had immediately left

having pointed out the house and before the police officers could reach

that house. In any event the informant did not testify at the trial.

The defence suggested that the police officers went in search of a

person by the name Wije and took the accused into custody as Wije who

is the husband of the accused was away. As a matter of fact, if the

informant had given information regarding trafficking of heroin at a

grand scale, the police would have undoubtedly questioned him as to

the names of the persons involved. It is very unlikely that a person who

is employed as an informant would have furnished information without

naming the person/s really involved in the commission of the offence.

The reason why the police team consisted of such a large number of

men, although explained to be the unpleasant experience the Police

had in the past having to face the opposition from the villages, does not

appear to be credible. The fact that the police team consisting of a

large number of men and 3 vehicles having been used for the raid is

suggestive of the prior information they may have received concerning

someone involved in the business of heroin at a large-scale. The police

had decided to make use of such a team keeping in mind the necessity

to resist any unforeseen opposition.

It was emphatically contended on behalf of the accused-appellant that

the case of the prosecution is even otherwise highly improbable as it is

wholly unacceptable that a village woman who was engaged in making

preparation for some green leaves to be cooked for the household to

rise up from being seated on the floor, then walk into a room, take a

box containing heroin and try to leave the home knowing very well that

policemen are outside the house.

The inbuilt improbabilities in the version of the prosecution which will

go to show that no conviction could be possible even if the evidence of

the witnesses are taken on their face value, warrant a court dealing

with a criminal appeal not to shut its eyes particularly when the

criminal proceedings set in motion against the appellant appear to be a

probable case of abuse of process of Court to put the appellant's liberty

in jeopardy.

The manner in which the raid had taken place anp Circumstances under

which the accused has been arrested red-handed as claimed by the

prosecution, while the accused lady walking into a trap knowing very

well that she was to be trapped, demonstrate the absence of prima

facie case for an offence particularly under section 54 (D) of the Poisons,

Opium And Dangerous Drugs Act. It is common knowledge that a person

extensively dealing with such prohibited items for financial gain

knowing very well the consequences would never have acted in the

manner the prosecution claimed that she did act. These inbuilt

improbabilities dealt above and the cumulative effect of all the

discrepancies undoubtedly lead to a reasonable doubt that the police

may have taken the accused into custody so as to get at Wije in an

indirect manner.

The information with regard to the commission of the offence relating

to this case has been received by 5.1 Basnayaka. The informant is

personal to him. The Information he received has been noted in his

notebook. He has accompanied IP Uyanage to Kimbulaela. There has

been successful raid carried out on earlier occasions on the information

of the same informer. Yet the prosecution has neither listed 51

"U.l.I'~1;"tmj1ilB14.I.,;mi!i 'mjlill1j1rmmsa'MY.I4ntiIMUm=."O);,@T@"4du

Basnayaka as a witness nor did they take any other steps subsequently

to call him as a witness. The learned President's Counsel has submitted

that this should be taken as a factor favourable to the accused.

There are two matters that arise for consideration from the failure of

the prosecution to call Basnayaka. Firstly, it has to be inferred that the

evidence of Basnayaka S I, which could have been led without any

impediment was not placed before court as it would be unfavourable to

the prosecution. Moreover, viewing the failure to, Gill him as a witness

on a realistic basis, it had resulted in serious deficiency in the proof of

the prosecution case.

On a perusal of the impugned judgment, with all respect to the learned

Judge, it appears to me as it lacks lucidity. The evidence of the 2

witnesses for the prosecution has not been analyzed in the judgment in

the correct perspective to ascertain their creditworthiness. The concept

of proof of a criminal charge beyond reasonable doubt has not been

properly applied to the evidence unfolded by the prosecution in a

critical approach. The learned High Court judge has failed to discuss

adequately and apply the concept of reasonable doubt to the evidence

adduced at the trial.

Inasmuch as the learned trial Judge had said that the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses had not been contradicted, she has failed to

apply the same yardstick with regard to the uncontradicted testimony

of the accused and her witnesses. Undoubtedly, as between the

evidence of the accused and her witnesses hardly any material

ITI'ft4.'t1l1:pmmDill.!.I$'ii'g'Sjl:mj1WLTl;iB"W@.lij .14'tmll 'll;.';I]',\#44.@611

contradictions had been suggested or adverted to by the prosecution. In

this respect it could be argued that the learned High Court Judge may

have forgotten to apply and give effect to the idiomatic expression that

what is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander as well. If the

same yardstick that was applied to the evidence of the prosecution with

regard to the absence of contradictions is equally applied to the

evidence adduced by the defence, the learned High Court Judge would

have had no alternative but to conclude that in the least degree that a

reasonable doubt had arisen with regard to the prqsecution version in

the light of the evidence of the defence.

Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that

the conviction of the accused cannot be allowed to stand as the

prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubts.

Appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed.
