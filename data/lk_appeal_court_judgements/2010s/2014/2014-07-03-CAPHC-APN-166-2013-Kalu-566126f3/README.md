RESPONDENT

Before A.W.A. Salam, J. (PICA) &

Malinie Gunarathne, J.

Counsel : Dr. Ranjit Fernando for the Petitioner

and Anoopa de Silva, SSC for the Respondents.

Argued on 26.03.2014

Decided on 02.07.2014

A. W.A. Salam, J. (PICA)

The petitioner has filed the present application in

revision on behalf of his father who was sentenced on his

plea to 7 years RI to run concurrently and a fine in

respect of 3 separate counts in addition to his being

directed to pay compensation to the virtual complainant

aggregating to Rs 600,000 1-.

When the revision application was taken up for

argument, the learned Senior State Counsel raised a

. preliminary objection as to the locus standi of the

petitioner to maintain the present application.

As regards the locus standi of a person other than the

convict to maintain an application to vary the sentence

passed on him, a divisional bench has now been

appointed in CA PHC APN 101/2013 with a view to fully

examine the legal position and clear any confusion that

may have arisen in this field of the law .

. In any event, locus standi had never been an Issue In

revision applications regarding bail and it is virtually

hardened into a rule now that the suspect need not

personally invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this

court to impugn a decision concerning his being refused

bail pending his trial. There are many instances where

this court has granted bail in the exercise of its original

jurisdiction on the invitation of persons who are

concerned with the welfare of suspects, pending the

conclusion of their cases.

The question as to whether a person other than a convict

could legitimately invite the Court to go into an issue as

to the legality or propriety of a decision relating to bail

pending appeal also remains unsettled. As the divisional

bench appointed to go into this field of the law is

expected to pronounce its decision, I do not propose to

rule on the question relating to the locus of the petitioner

. to maintain this application.

Turning to the impugned decision, as IS evident from

proceedings dated 23 October 2013, prior to the

Page 3 of 6

imposition of the sentence, the learned High Court Judge

had inquired directly from the virtual complainant

(although he was duly represented by a Lawyer) whether

he expects the court to pass a severe sentence on the

accused. To this question the virtual complainant, as any

complainant would, promptly responded with an answer

. in the affirmative. Surprisingly, the learned High Court

Judge sates in the impugned judgment that the virtual

complainant had expressed his desire that the accused

should be severely punished for the offence committed.

The entire sentencing process adopted by the learned

High Court Judge indicates that he had passed sentence

on the accused not in the proper exercise of the judicial

discretion, but according to the whims and fancies of the

virtual complainant. This clearly shows that he had

surrendered the exercise of judicial discretion entrusted

to him, to a party in a case and in doing so he had acted

unreasonably in respect of the accused. The sentencing

method adopted by the learned Judge does not

demonstrate that the judicial discretion has been

exercised according to Law.

Further, the learned High Court Judge in passIng the

sentence on the accused had taken irrelevant

consideration into account and omitted to take certain

relevant matters into account.

It is elementary principle of law that justice should be

meted out without being bias towards anyone. The

correct approach to be adopted in this respect is to apply

the oft-repeated saying of Lord Chief Justice Hewart in R

v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1 (1924) 1 K. B.

at 259.] that "It is not merely of some importance, but is

of fundamental importance that justice should not only

be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen

to be done".

The learned High Court judge in the instant case has

failed to demonstrate such a standard and the sentence

passed on the accused ex facie appears to be arbitrary

and illogical. In doing so the learned High Court Judge

appears to have unconsciously favoured the virtual

complainant by imposing the impugned sentence little

realizing that judicial discretion/power vested in him is

inalienable. In such circumstances, irrespective of the

question relating to the locus of the petitioner, once the

court is informed of an illegality or impropriety of a

judgment, it is the duty of this court to call for the

record so as to deal with it, as the interest of Justice may

reqUIre.

In the circumstances, acting under article 145 of the

Constitution of the democratic socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka, I am reluctantly compelled to enter an order for

Page 5 of 6

the inspection and an examination of the record of the

original court to facilitate this court to ascertain the

propriety and legality of the sentence passed on the

accused.
