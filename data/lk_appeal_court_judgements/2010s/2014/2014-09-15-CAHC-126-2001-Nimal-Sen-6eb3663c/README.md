his is an appeal by the accused-appellant from his conviction

against grave sexual abuse committed on the 18th day of April

1998 on a girl, in contravention of Section 365 B (2) b of the Penal

Code, as amended by Act No's 22 of1995 and 29 of 1998.

The accused-appellant was originally indicted for committing an

offence of rape on her, punishable under Section 364 (2) of the Penal

o o o N ...... " ..-

..-o o N ...... -0 N ..- u 1

Code as amended by Act No 22 of 1999. Apparently, as there was no

evidence against the accused to establish the charge of rape, the

prosecution with the leave of Court had amended the count in the

indictment to grave sexual abuse, an offence punishable under

Section 365 (B) (2) (b) of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No's 22

of 1995 and 29 of 1998. The charge has been amended on 27 August

2001 and the accused-appellant is said to have committed the

offence on or about 18 April 1998.

Had the accused-appellant been charged with committing the

aforesaid offence under the relevant Section of the Penal Code as

amended by Act No 22 of 1995 only, ( without making reference to

Act No 29 of 1998) he could have, as of right, been able to take up

the defence of consent, if he so desired. However, as he was charged

with having committed the offence, under the relevant Section of

the Penal Code, read with the amended Act No 29 of 1998 AS WELL,

he was deprived of taking up the defence of 'consent', as subsequent

to coming into operation Act No 29 of 1998, the defence of

"consent", is of no relevance.

(The emphasis made here is to signify the prejudice caused to the

accused-appellant by making reference to Act No 29/1998 in the

amended charge)

Significantly, the amendment to the Penal Code effected by Act No

29 of 1998 came into operatton with prospective effect from 4 June

o o o N ...... r-.. ..-

ro .... :J a. ro ~ "0 ro .... :J C u :r: .-o a N ...... -c N .- u 2

1998. The offence is said to have been committed, on 18 April 1998.

This means that he had been charged, found guilty, convicted and

sentenced to an offence committed in terms of the Law which had

come into operation nearly after one and a half months after the

commission of the offence.

By reason of the accused-appellant having been charged under a Law

which was not in force at that time, he could have be.en convicted of

the charge only if the amendment to the Penal code made by Act No

29/1998 had come into operation retrospectively when in fact the

law did not attract such an effect.

In terms of Article 13 (6) of the Constitution no person shall be held

guilty of an offence on account of any act or omission which did not,

at the time of such act or omission, constitute such an offence, and

no penalty shall be imposed for any offence more severe than the

penalty in force at the time such offence was committed.

Accordingly, if the accused-appellant had not been misled into the

belief that the defence of 'consent' was not available to him, he

could have taken up the defence of consent.

In the circumstances, the accused appellant had been adversely

prej udiced by the incorrect reference made to Act No 29/1998 in the

charge. Besides, the learned High Court Judge also had proceeded to

convict the accused-appellant, under the misapprehension that Act

No 29 of 1998 was good Law as at 18 April 1998. This undoubtedly has

occasioned in a miscarriage of justice.

The learned President's Counsel has contended that the fact which

led to the amendment of the charge from the offence of rape to

grave sexual abuse by itself self-explanatory as to the contradictory

nature of the evidence of the prosecutrix which should be viewed as

being favourable to the appeal. Although this. argument merits

favourable consideration, I find it redundant to delve into that

aspect, as the misapprehension regarding the operational date of Act

No 29 of 1998 is sufficient to determine this appeal.

Before I part with this appeal, I am inclined to draw attention to an

aspect which has passed through my mind on a consideration of Act

No 29 of 1998 not being part of our Statute book as at the date of the

alleged offence. The consent as a defence in respect of a victim of

grave sexual abuse has been excluded only by the introduction of Act

No 29 of 1998, i.e with effect from 4 June 1998. In terms of the

amendment brought in by the said Act, the act of grave sexual abuse

is complete when committed on a victim of under 16 years with or

without the consent. (See Section 7 of Act No 29 of 1998 which is

renumbered as Section 365 B (1) (aa) of the Penal Code).

This means the prosecution has a burden to exclude "consent" in

respect the commission of 'the offence committed prior to 4th June

o o o N ...... "'-..--

ro I... ::J C. ro ..t::. " ro I... ::J C <: u ::r: ..--o o N ...... '" N ..--<: u 4

1998. On a perusal of the proceedings and the analysis of the

evidence by the learned Judge, I am unable to find that the

prosecution had discharged such a burden to exclude the consent or

in other words to prove beyond all reasonable doubts that the act

was done against the consent or without the consent of the victim.

In passing I would like to have it replaced on record that the accused

has been convicted and sentenced on 28 November 2001 and the

appeal has been taken up for hearing for the first time on 8

September 2003. For whatever reasons it may have been, the appeal

has taken almost 11 years to see an end, although it could have been

conveniently disposed of at the first date of argument or on a later

date of close proximity. Quite fortunately, even without going into

the question of exceptional circumstances, the learned High Court

Judge has released the accused-appellant on bail pending appeal 2

weeks after his conviction. This misdirection has turned out to be a

blessings in disguise as the accused-appellant would have had to

otherwise languish in incarceration pending the determination of this

appeal for such a long time.

In the circumstances enumerated above I am of the firm view that

the accused-appellant should undoubtedly succeed in this appeal.

Hence, I allow the appeal and acquit the accused-appellant of the

charge levelled against him.
