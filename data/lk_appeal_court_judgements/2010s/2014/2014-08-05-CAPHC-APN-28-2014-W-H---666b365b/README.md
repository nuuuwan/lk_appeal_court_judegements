JUDGMENT OF COURT

This is an application for the exerCise of the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court vested under Article 145 of the

Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

In terms of the said Article, the Court of Appeal is empowered

to call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of First

Instance and in the exercise of its revisionary powers make any

order thereon as the interests of justice may require.

The application has been made by the suspect-petitioner-

petitionerl and upon such application we called for the record

from the relevant Magistrate's Court and heard the petitioner

and the Hon. Attorney General on the impugned orders with a

view to ascertain the degree of intervention required to mete

out justice. We wish to place on record our gratitude to both

counsel for the assistance rendered to arrive at a decision,

particularly the learned State Counsel who did not oppose the

application of the petitioner.

The facts that necessitated the application is required to be set

out in some detail to assess the extent of the intervention

required to make an order in the interests of justice under

Article 145 of the Constitution.

It begins with one MIS Malkanthi making a complaint against

the petitioner to the complainant-respondent-respondent

alleging the commission of an offence of cheating (involving a

sum of Rs.4 million) said to be punishable under Section 403

1 Referred to in the rest of this judgment as the "petitioner"

CA PHC APN 28/2014

of the Penal Code. Facts regarding the complaint was reported

by the police to the Magistrate seeking an order on the bank

to issue certain account details of the suspect. In the

meantime the virtual complainant filed an affidavit alleging

that the suspect was acting in collusion with the police and

absconding to avoid court. The learned Magistrate without any

inquiry promptly issued a warrant of arrest of the suspect.

Then the petitioner surrendered himself to the Magistrate's

Court on 05.12.2013 and was remanded until 12.12.13 on

unproven allegations that he had interfered with witnesses

and absconded and evaded arrest with the connivance of the

police. Implicit in the order to remand the suspect is that he

was remanded because of the conduct alleged in the affidavit.

On 12.12.13 the learned Magistrate refused the application for

bail acting under Section 14 (1) of the Bail Act and further

remanded the suspect until 24.12.2013.

The petitioner while being on remand, caused a motion to be

filed to have his case mentioned in his absence, on 19.12.2013

and moved for bail through his Lawyer. The Counsel who

appeared for the petitioner acknowledged liability on behalf of

his client and undertook to pay the virtual-complainant

Rs.200,000/- on that day and the balance by 13 instalments

consisting of Rs.300,000 / - each and then moved for bail.

Thereupon, the learned Magistrate disregarding the

circumstances he referred to under Section 14 of the Bail Act,

readily released the petitioner on bail carrying lenient

conditions despite the allegation of having absconded and

interfered with the prosecution witnesses. At the same time he

ordered the petitioner to file an affidavit, incorporating the

CA PHC APN 28/2014

! j I I

. undertaking (5zrl'153 ~2S)coG)zrl'E)",) purportedly acting under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (Emphasis

is to signify the crux of the issue)

The petitioner was in ~ quandary about how to respond to the

said order, as he anticipated that noncompliance of it would

end up in him being remanded once again, a habitual method

adopted in certain courts in blatant disregard of the Law

towards the indirect achievement of what cannot directly be

achieved. As expected the petitioner ended up in remand

custody for noncompliance of the directions. He states that he

was unable secure his release from the remand prison and

therefore compelled to tender the affidavit. The question that

arises for consideration here is the legality of the order

compelling to produce an affidavit and to what extent the

alleged settlement or the admission as the Magistrate calls it,

is enforceable in law particularly when no charge sheet has

been filed.

The direction made by the learned Magistrate requiring the

petitioner to tender an affidavit was challenged in the

Provincial High Court and quite unfortunately, the learned

High Court Judge failed to appreciate the obvious error

committed by the Magistrate in directing the petitioner to

tender an affidavit.

Against the judgment of the High Court, the petitioner invoked

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in these proceedings

and we refrained from issuing notice, as the petitioner had no

basis to fear that he would be remanded, in the event of his

failing to pay the instalments. We made this observation in our

judgment and further made a detail guideline as to what the

CA PHC APN 28/2014

Magistrate should not do than what he is expected to do. We

thus terminated proceedings in the revision application, as we

had the fullest confidence in the learned Magistrate that he

would not resort to extra judicial methods to enforce the

purported settlement or give effect to the purported admission.

In our judgment, we categorically observed that the Magistrate

would not make such an illegal order remanding the petitioner

for non-payment of the instalment, as there is no settlement

acceptable in Law and no valid affidavit is given under Section

420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We specifically

mentioned in our judgment that the only course open to the

prosecution, in the event of non-payment of the instalment, is

to file an appropriate charge sheet and establish the guilt of

the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt, to bring the CUlprit to

the books.

However, when the case was mentioned for payment of the

instalment, the learned Magistrate remanded the petitioner,

although comprehensive guidelines were given by us,

expecting reasonable adherence on his part. The petitioner

states that he produced our judgment to learned Magistrate

and to his utmost surprise, the learned Magistrate having read

the guidelines, yet remanded him for non-payment of the

instalment.

Quite surprisingly, the remanding order made by Court was

not for a particular period but until the happening of an event,

i.e. until the petitioner makes payment. In Sinhala the order is

written as follows

" 3/4/20 14 ~25) ~c;c @(S)e5@() ~25) cob Cfll'53 @1.5251 6{8c.:lC

C2Sfall 5 1/2 ~~C i5)7251azsJ2:5)b ae ~c;JIDB25125)".

CA PHC APN 28/2014

The order when translated means "Since time has been taken

to make payment on 3/4/2014 release upon deposit of 5 Y2

lacks"

Later on the same <:lay the learned Magistrate has made

another order directing that the 5 Y2 Lacks be paid in cash to

Mrs Sandya Thalduwa, Attorney-at-Law and the petitioner to

be released upon making the payment. Despite the learned

Magistrate's direction to hand over the cash to the attorney-

at-law of the virtual complainant, the petitioner states that he

had no alternative but to obey the first order of the learned

Magistrate to get himself freed from custody. In the

circumstances, he now complains of extra judicial method

adopted by Court to recover the money and invites us to invoke

Article 145.

We have anxiously perused the several orders made by the

learned Magistrate. In our opinion, a charge of contempt

against the authority of this court cannot be maintained

against the learned Magistrate, as we have not given him any

specific directions to follow, except that we made certain

guidelines to be adhered to. However, we are of the opinion

that the orders directing the petitioner to tender an affidavit

and the detention of the petitioner until such time the

instalment is paid warrant the intervention of this Court to put

the record right and to undo the injustice meted out the

petitioner.

The distinction between the expreSSIOns "Suspect" and

"Accused" plays a vital role in the application of the Provisions

of the Law to the present controversy.

CA PHC APN 28/2014

The point to remember is that a person is still at the C investigation stage when forwarded under custody to Court in

terms of Section 116 (1). Forwarding the suspect to Court is

incorrect to be deemed as an automatic institution of

proceedings. Criminal proceedings are instituted under

Chapter XIV, when the Magistrate takes cognIsance of the

accusation contained in the Police report or in a written

complaint or upon the taking of evidence as the case may be

in terms of Section 136 (1). It is to be noted that the language

used in Section 136 (1) envisages a person accused of an

offence and not a mere suspect.

A fundamental question that has to be discussed at this stage

is the extent to which a Magistrate is permitted to record a

statement of the suspect prior to the institution of criminal

proceedings under Chapter XIV.

Under Section 127, prior to the commencement of a trial or

inquiry, a Magistrate may record any statement. However, a

Magistrate shall not record any such statement being a

confession unless upon questioning the person making it that

he has reason to believe that it was made voluntarily. Further,

when he records any such statement he shall make a

memorandum at the foot of such record to the effect that it

was made voluntarily and taken in his presence and hearing

and was read over by him to the person making it and admitted

by maker of the statement to be correct, and it contains

accurately the whole of the statement made by such person.

The statement saId to have been made by the learned counsel

of the suspect, undoubtedly suggests the inference that the

suspect committed the offence. A statement made by a Lawyer

CA PHC APN 28/2014

on behalf of his client which IS of a confessional nature

suggesting the inference that the suspect committed the

offence is excluded, for such a statement clearly is not the act

and deed of the suspect. Therefore, the statement made by

the counsel admitting liability being a form of a confession

cannot be acted upon by the Magistrate.

It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that there was a

practice in the relevant Court to grant bail, in this type of

prosecutions, if the liability is admitted. We are unable to

ascertain the truth of this statement. Be that as it may,

generally, if a suspect believes that he can find his way out of

the remand prison, with an admission of guilt, a suspect will

always be tempted to admit the wrong to even to end his agony

for a short while. This temptation negates voluntariness. As

Ulpian, a Roman Jurist of AD 200, described it in reference to

torture "The strong will resist and the weak will say anything

to end the pain."

Quite apart from the confessional statement having not

directly originated from the suspect, there is no certificate to

the effect either as to voluntariness of it or that it was taken in

the presence of the Magistrate etc. Further as the suspect was

then absent the Magistrate did not have the opportunity to

question him as to the voluntariness. There was no certificate

appended as contemplated under Section 127.Therefore, the

statement said to have been made by the Counsel needs to be

completely shut out.

The Magistrate appears to have recorded the statement of the

Counsel, on the mistaken belief that it is an admission under

Section 420. In such a situation whether it can be recorded

CA PHC APN 28/2014

, under Section 420 and whether the suspect can be directed to

tender an affidavit are vital questions to be answered to resolve

the issue regarding the admissibility of the affidavit.

A Magistrate has the power to record an admission, and to

receive an affidavit under the proviso to section 420 only after

the framing of the charges. The affidavit has not been tendered

in this instance before the trial nor has it been forwarded in

the course of the trial. As such, if the purported admission is

to be given effect to, it must satisfy the requirement set out in

the Proviso to Section 420. The Proviso reads as follows ....

Provided further that where such admissions have

been made before the trial, they shall be in writing,

signed by the accused and attested as to their

accuracy and the identity and signature of the

accused by an attorney-at-law. (Emphasis added)

The question as to the point of time an admission be recorded

under section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was

considered in the case of Perera V s A. G. (~ourt of Appeal)

(1998) 1 SLR 378. Taking into consideration the purpose of

an admission the bench took the view that an admission is

recordable at any stage of the trial before the prosecution

closes the case.

Further, it must be noted that an admission under Section 420

is referable only to an accused and not to a suspect. Section

420 mandates that the affidavit should be certified as to the

identity and signature of the accused but not the suspect and

it must be certified by an attorney-at-law. Quite interestingly,

the petitioner was not an accused but only a suspect when he

CA PHC APN 28/2014

, had been directed to file the affidavit, as no charge sheet had

been filed at that time.

Taking into consideration, the legal position discussed above,

it is quite clear that there had been no admission made in this

case by the petitioner. If the petitioner is desirous of making

an admission, he can still do so, provided it is made at the

right stage, namely before the commencement of the trial or in

the course of the trial.

In terms of Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

admissions are limited to facts in issue and relevant facts.

However, the Section specifically allows admissions to be made

as to the identity of any person, matter or thing, the fact that

an identification parade was held and that a particular witness

iden tified a particular person at that parade, the fact that a

particular matter or tiling was sealed in the presence of a

particular person and forwarded to the Government Analyst

for examination and analysis, the fact that a particular matter

or thing sent to the Government Analyst for analysis and it was

returned by him to Court, after such examination and

analysis, the fact that a particular surveyor sketch was made

by a particular person.

It is important to note that the commission of the offence is

not proved with the making of this purported admission. Once

an admission is recorded according to law, the prosecution has

to prove the other ingredients of the offence.

Can the Magistrate, direct to a suspect to tender an affidavit,

incorporating certain purported admissions made before him

orally? My considered view is that the Magistrate is not

CA PHC APN 28/2014

t\ ,f III

I

r , empowered to do so for three reasons. Primarily, in such an

event, the making of the admission is devoid of the elementary

characteristic of it being voluntary. Secondly, the Law does not

empower the Magistrate to order a suspect to tender an

affidavit. Thirdly, an examination of Section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure reveals that an affidavit has to be affirmed

by an accused and not by a suspect.

The other question remains to be addressed is the procedure

to be followed when a person who has acknowledged liability

to make certain payments later falls into arrears. In this case,

there was no legally admissible admission, to call upon the

petitioner to pay the money. However much the learned

Magistrate may have been keen in recovering the money from

the suspect, he had no power to remand the suspect as a

punitive measure to compel the suspect to part with the

money. When he does that he steps out of the permissible

province of law and espouses a cause outside the Law.

Remanding a suspect for noncompliance of the purported

settlement or going back on the admission, as the Magistrate

calls it, would tantamount to cancellation of the bail. The bail

act specifically provides the circumstances under which an

order for cancelation of bail may be made.

Quite strikingly, the petitioner has not committed any acts

warranting the cancellation of bail. Hence, undoubtedly the

Magistrate had acted in excess of his power when he ordered

the suspect to be detained until the payment is made. It is to

be observed that the order to remand the suspect indefinitely,

as was done by the learned Magistrate, until the payment is

made, would have had the effect of a remand order which is

CA PHC APN 28/2014

r

.perpetual in nature. If the suspect did not pay the money, in

terms of the illogical order to detain him until payment is

made, the prison authorities may have had to keep him on

remand until the payment is made irrespective of the time

factor. If no payment was made, the petitioner would have to

languish in remand for life. The absurdity of the learned

Magistrate's order is evident from its illogicalness. When the

orders made to remand the suspect by Magistrate from time to

time are closely scrutinized, it is crystal clear that they been

made as punitive measure and not to achieve the actual object

of a remand order.

In the event of a fine imposed by court or any other payment

recoverable as if it is a fine imposed, the methods in which it

can be recovered are laid down in the law. The recognized

method by which any payment legally due from an offender

can be recovered includes issuing a warrant for the levy of the

amount by distress "and sale of any movable property belonging

to the offender or the offender may be sentenced to undergo

imprisonment in default of payment. In this context, it is

noteworthy to place it on record that the law does not permit

a person to be detained in remand in default of a payment

which is due. In passing, we should state that an offender who

is visited with a fine only, strictly speaking, cannot be detained

even for a moment within the precincts of court, particularly

inside a cell guarded by prison authorities, until he makes the

payment. He must have the freedom to walk into the registry

to pay the fine. His detention even for moment would be

deprivation of his freedom of movement otherwise than in

accordance with a procedure established by law. It is indeed a

CA PHC APN 28/2014

indeed a matter for grave concern that the petitioner has been

deprived of his liberty in an unusual manner.

This clearly shows that the Court was without authority to

enforce the admission, in the manner it was sought to be

enforced by the learned Magistrate in his endeavour to recover

the money from the suspect. Needless to say that such a

method to compel payment is unknown to our law.

It is appropriate at this stage to cite a passage from the

decision in C.A (PHC) Application No. 58/2011, which deals

with the purposes of cancellation of bail. In that case Sunil

Rajapaksha, J dealing with the purposes of cancellation of bail

stated as follows ...

The purpose of refusing bailor cancelling a

subsisting bail order inter alia is to protect the

community, reduce the likelihood of further

offending and to ensure that the suspect attends

Court throughout the trial and makes himself

available to be sentenced.

In Jayawickrama Subasinghe Arachchilage Ariyapala, CA

(PHC) APN No: 134/12 on the importance of bail, A. W. A.

Salam, J held as follows ....

"The concept of bail is the recognition of the liberty

of a person between the time of his arrest and verdict

subject to the condition that he re-appears in Court

for his trial until its conclusion or until he is

sentenced. The Court is entitled to cancel a bail bond

(after hearing the accused) for violating the bail

condi tions which include specific grounds such as

CA PHC APN 28/2014

having threatened or influenced or tampered with

evidence or interfered with the investigation or

obstructed the judicial process or otherwise misused

or abused the grant of bail". (Emphasis added)

The provisions relating to the remanding of the suspects

concerned in the commission of an offence, being a restriction

imposed on the liberty of the subject as guaranteed under the

Constitution should be interpreted strictly in accordance with

the letter of the Law and not in a slapdash manner.

There is another aspect to this issue. Even if the suspect

completes the payment of 4 million, yet he has to be charged

on the facts reported either for cheating or criminal

misappropriation, as the purported admission per-se IS no

proof that he committed the offence, unlike an unconditional

plea of guilt. Given the highest degree of benefit to the

prosecution, the purported admission would mean nothing

more than an acknowledgment of having received Rs 4 million

from the virtual complainant.

The issue will be worse, if the petitioner after making payment

of the money or part thereof, is acquitted on the charges at the

end of the trial. In such an event the payment made by him

will have to be returned to him.

The case of S M Nirmalene De Soyza -Vs-Officer-in-Charge,

(Unit 2), Colombo CA.(PHC) APN. No. 101/2011, concerns a

similar issue. Without the accused being charged a settlement

was entered to the effect that the entire amount of Rs. 2 million

would be paid by the accused by way of instalments within 01

year. For not honouring the undertaking he was sentenced to

02 years R I and the High Court did not set aside the sentence,

but re-scheduled the scheme of payment with a default

sentence re-introduced. Since, the learned Magistrate

convicted the accused without him being found guilty or

without a plea of guilt being tendered the Court of appeal set

aside the proceedings and sent the case back for re-trial.

In this matter, quite regrettably the attorneys-at-Law and the

learned Magistrate have failed to appreciate the real

importance of the Constitutional Provisions, Code of Criminal

Procedure and the Evidence Ordinance to decide the simple

question of the petitioner's criminal liability. Instead of

deciding the issue based on the legal provisions, motivated by

the enthusiasm to grant 'relief summarily to the aggrieved

party, the Magistrate appears to have had recourse to an extra-

legal method to recover the money.

Assuming the learned Magistrate's attempt to compound the

offence is permissible, yet there is no Provision for an offence

to be compounded before the charge sheet is framed. Basically

to compound an offence, the accused should be informed

formally, the exact charge preferred against him. It is based on

the charge one has to decide on the permissibility to compound

a charge. Even to record an admission, one needs to know the

charge to ascertain what the fact in issues are and what facts

are relevant, to invoke Section 420.

On the other hand if the learned Magistrate was correct in

compounding the offence, then in terms of Section 266 (4) (b)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it shall have the effect of an

acquittal of the accused. In such an event, the learned

CA PHC APN 28/2014

r I ! i I

~ Magistrate would have had no power to remand the petitioner

for non-payment of the instalment.

The right to a fair trial which is of fundamental importance in

a democratic society, occupies a central place under our

Constitution. Judges must act strictly according to law and

not deviate from the rules of evidence and the procedure laid

down to find an accused guilty of the charge levelled against

him.

The power conferred on a Judge to remand an accused is not

mean t to be exercised to pu t a suspect in to unnecessary

inconvenience, as and when the judge feels like remanding

him. Judges must always act with reasonableness and

according to law. Even the judicial discretion should be

exercised not to accomplish a personal goal of a Judge but in

harmony with the laws of the land upon reasonable grounds

to achieve justice to both parties. The Judges must exercise

the discretion vested in them as a trust entrusted and always

conscious of the norm that a discretion does not empower

them to do what they like merely because they are minded to

do so. On the contrary they must in the exercise of the

discretion do not what they like but what they ought. The

impugned proceedings dated 19.12.2014 do not conform to

such a standard.

In the course of the argument, it came to light that several

Magistrate's Courts of different jurisdictions adopt the

identical method to deliver hurried justice. To my mind, this is

a cause for unpleasant surprise and under no circumstances

can it be condoned. Such procedure which is unknown to the

Law, if encouraged would destroy the entire fabric of justice

CA PHC APN 28/2014

(

I I I I i

.. , and a perpetual challenge to the implementation of the concept

of presumption of innocence enshrined in the Constitution,

evidentiary rule relating to burden proof enacted in the

Evidence Ordinance, procedural mode of recording admissions

authorized under the Code of Criminal Procedure and

recording of confessions and statements pending investigation

under Section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the

scheme relating to compounding of offences under Section 266

of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In construing the relevant legal provisions relating to conduct

of prosecutions, we cannot throw into jeopardy the entire

fabric of administration of law and justice and directly or

indirectly encourage or condone extra judicial approaches to

take precedence over the time tested Law and established

procedures. Such innovative practices, if disregarded would

lead to a disruption of the Rule of Law and the Administration

of Justice which this Court and all other Courts including the

Magistrate's Courts are committed to preserve.

In the circumstances, there being no admission of liability to

pay the amount mentioned in the B report, in the eyes of the

law, the order dated 19 December 2013 cannot be allowed to

stand. As the learned Magistrate had no power or authority to

order the petitioner to tender an affidavit under Section 420,

the purported admission is expunged from the record and the

order dated 19.12.2014 is set aside. In the result, the learned

Magistrate shall now commence the summary trial against the

accused and enter his findings and judgment in due course.

Whatever the deposits made by the petitioner under the

purported admission shall be paid back to him.
