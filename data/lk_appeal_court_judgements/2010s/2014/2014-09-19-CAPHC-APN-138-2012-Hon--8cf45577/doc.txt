Argued &

Decided on 02.09.2014.

K. T. Chitrasiri, J.

Learned D.S.G. submits that the learned High Court Judge

was in error when he converted the fine imposed on the 2nd accused-

respondent, to make it a crown cost. Learned Counsel for the 2nd

accused-respondent too, concedes that it is not legal to have converted

the fine into crown costs.

Learned High Court Judge in Kandy by his order dated 12th II

September, 2012 has imposed a fine on the 2nd accused-respondent a

sum amounting to# Rs. 45,000/- carrying a default sentence of two 'r !

years rigorous imprisonment. Having imposed a fine, upon considering

the submissions made on behalf of the 2nd accused-respondent, the

2

learned High Court Judge decided to levy a crown cost in lieu of the

fine imposed on the 2nd accused-respondent.

Section 306 (3) (II) of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates

that State costs can be imposed only up to a sum of Rs. One

Thousand Five Hundred (Rs. 1500/-) In this instance crown costs

amount of Rs. 45,000/- had been imposed which exceeds Rs. 1,500/-.

... j

Therefore the decision to impose a crown cost Rs. 45.000/- is " unlawful. Accordingly, we set aside the order imposing crown costs ,l'b amounting Rs. 45,000/-. Hence the fine ofRs. 45,000/- imposed on

" the 2nd accused-respondent for the committing of offence of Trafficking

and Possession of Cannabis under Poison Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance Act No. 13 of 1994 is to stand as it is.

The Registrar is directed to remit the record with this order

to the High Court in Kandy enabling the learned High Court Judge to

take necessary steps.

Application allowed.
