This appeal arises on the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

08.09.2012, by which the revision application filed by the 1St and 6th

respondent-petitioner-appellants against the determination of the learned

Magistrate under Section 68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, had been

dismissed.

The learned Magistrate by his determination has granted possession to the

party who was in possession two months immediately preceding the date of the

report filed under Section 66. The learned High Court Judge has affirmed the

determination of the Magistrate for this reason. As such, I see no reasons to

interfere with the impugned judgment. Accordingly, the appeal stands

dismissed. There shall be no costs.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL SUNIL RAJAPAKSHA, J.

I agree.
