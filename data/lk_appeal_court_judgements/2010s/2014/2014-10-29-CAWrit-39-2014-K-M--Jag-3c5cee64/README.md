At this stage the Counsel for the petitioner states that his client, the

petitioner has expressed concerns about the judges comprising this bench

General's Department.

Additional Solicitor General Mr. Shavindra Fernando PC states in

reply that none of the judges who comprise this bench have had any kind

of association with the facts forming the subject matter of this petition

when they were serving in the Attorney General's Department.

In the circumstances, we are of the view that no impediment exist as to

the 2nd respondent, Director, CID, to resume and thereafter properly

conclude the said investigation in its normal course. He has sought

connected views which are referred to in the prayers as well. During his

submission, Counsel for the petitioner submits that his client, petitioner

marked X3 dated 05.11.2013 the B report filed by Officer in Charge,

Commercial Crimes Division No.2, Criminal Investigation Department,

Colombo 01 to the effect that before they record the statement of one

on 26th August 2013.

In reply to the submissions made by the Counsel for the petitioner,

the Additional Solicitor General Mr. Shavindra Fernando, President's

Counsel submits to this Court that the original complaint was first made

Fernando, ASG the Attorney General has not called for the extracts

thereafter but the Director CID on his own submitted the extracts to the

Attorney General's Department with the final report dated 26th August

2013. Mr. Fernando confirms that in the final report submitted by CID

there is no reference to the effect that the investigations are incomplete

and CID moves further time to continue with the investigation. According

to Mr. Fernando by looking at the covering letter, final report and the

extracts it is clear that the CID has submitted extracts after completing

the investigations. The file was allocated to the Senior State Counsel on

18.07.2013. The Senior State Counsel to whom this file was allocated

has submitted his recommendation to the Additional Solicitor General in

charge of CID investigations on 14.10.2013 and the said Additional

Solicitor General has submitted his recommendation to the officer in

charge of the criminal division, the Senior Additional Solicitor General on

15.10.2013. The said Senior Additional Solicitor General had agreed with

the said recommendation and decided to discharge the 3rd respondent on

06.11.2013 and accordingly the discharge paper were sent to the

respective Magistrate's Court on the 26. 11.2013.

We will no doubt the manner in which the records had been

maintained in the Attorney General's Department. Mr. Fernando ASG

appears in court with the relevant files but we will no doubt the ~

submissions made by Mr. Fernando from the bar table because he

represents the right functionary with whom the discretion to prosecute or

not to prosecute is rested. This court has no doubt that the discretion has

been correctly and properly exercised and we see no reason to issue

notice in this matter. Accordingly, notice is refused.
