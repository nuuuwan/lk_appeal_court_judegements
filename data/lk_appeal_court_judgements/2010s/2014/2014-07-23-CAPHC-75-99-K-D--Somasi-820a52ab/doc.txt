WRITIEN SUBMISSIONS TENDERED ON: 20.05.2014

DECIDED ON: 22.07.2014

A W A Salam, J (P / C.A)

7hiS is an appeal against the judgment dated 22nd April

1999 of the Provincial High Court holden at Ratnapura in

the Sabaragamuwa Province. By the said judgment the

learned High Court Judge set aside a determination made by

the Magistrate under Section 68 (3) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 on the grounds that the

disputed land has not been properly identified, notice in

terms of Section 66 (4) of the said Act has not been exhibited

on the land and there was no breach of the peace or

likelihood of it.

The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that the

learned High Court Judge erred in holding that the corpus

had not been properly identified. It is to be observed that

none of the parties raised the question of the non-identity of

the corpus. On the contrary, the 1st respondent in

paragraph 4 of his affidavit filed in the Primary Court

admitted that the complainant resides on the corpus and

further conceded the schedule which describes the metes and

bounds of the corpus. Similarly, the 2nd respondent in

paragraph 3 of his affidavit admitted the complainant's

residence on the land in question and the corpus as set out

with metes and bounds in the affidavit of the complainant. In

the circumstances, it is difficult to understand as to how the

Page 6 of 10

~ ..

learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion that there

has been a failure to identify the corpus.

Even though the learned High Court Judge has made a

reference in his judgment to the notice not having been

affIxed on the land, it is to be noted from the report of the

Fiscal that he had in fact exhibited the notice on a rubber

tree standing on the corpus which is in extent of about 36

acres. Even if notices had not been affIxed, it had not caused

any prejudice to the respondents, as they have participated at

the inquiry having fIled the pleadings, as required under

Chapter VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

As regards the fmding of the learned High Court Judge that

there had been no breach of the peace, it must be observed

that several complaints had been made to the police with

regard to the dispute between the . main parties over the

subject matter. As per complaint made on 29 April 1993 by

the 2nd appellant, the 1st respondent and 25 others had

entered the corpus after verbally threatening the appellants

and evicted them from the corpus and had thereafter

proceeded to tap rubber from the trees. The 1 st appellant also

has made a complaint to the police on 7 March 1993 in which

he had stated inter alia that his watcher had come looking for

him and informed him that the 1 st respondent and few others

Page 7 of 10

had entered the land and the house which was under

construction. In the same complaint he had said that the 1st

respondent had set fire to the house on the corpus and as a

result of the fire the entire house got destroyed.

In the circumstances, it appears that the 3 grounds on which

the learned High Court Judge had relied to set aside the

determination of the learned Magistrate are unsustainable.

On a perusal of the impugned judgment it is to be seen that

the learned High Court Judge having set aside the

determination made by the learned Magistrate had failed to

enter any consequential directions. Therefore, if the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge is allowed to

remain, there will be no finality reached with regard to the

dispute that was referred to the Magistrate's Court.

Admittedly, the petitioners have invoked the reVISIOnary

jurisdiction of the High Court almost after 5 months of the

Magistrate's order. Explaining the delay the petitioners

averred that they filed a motion to obtain a copy of the case

record from the Magistrate's Court on the very day the order

was delivered i.e on 24th June 1996 and they received the

documents applied for only on 13 August 1996 and as a

result there was a delay in obtaining legal advice. Even if it

be so, yet the revision application in the High Court has been

Page 8 of 10

filed on 20 November 1996. The learned Counsel for the

appellant has pointed out that the motion of the respondents

said to have been filed _on the very same day the order has

been delivered by the Magistrate, has been minuted on 10

July 1996. This clearly shows that the application for

certified copies has been made on 10 July 1996 and not on

the 24 June 1996. In any event to revise the order of the

learned Magistrate dated 24 June 1996 the petitioners have

filed their application in the High Court on 20 November

1996, nearly after 5 months. On a perusal of the petition of

the petitioner's filed in the High Court the only explanation

given as regards the delay is that they were able to obtain the

documents from the Magistrate's Court as late as on 13

August 1996.

On the question of delay, the petitioners have failed to adduce

any plausible explanation and above all the explanation with

regard to the date on which they applied for certified copies

appears to be incorrect. Hence, the explanation given by the

petitioners as to the delay in invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be accepted. Therefore

the petitioners in the High Court were guilty of laches in

invoking the revisionary powers of the High Court. As such

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge cannot be

allowed to remain. In the result, this appeal is allowed and

Page 9 of 10

IIII

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge is set aside

and the revision application filed by the petitioners in the

High Court is substituted with an order of dismissal.

Consequently, the order of the learned Magistrate will now

prevail. There shall be no costs.
