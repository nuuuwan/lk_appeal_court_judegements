A W A Salam, J T

his appeal concerns the legality of a decision made

by the learned High Court judge in the exercise of

his original jurisdiction, when he was invited to exercise

his prerogative powers to issue a writ of cetiorari to

quash a decision taken by the 1 st respondent-

respondent. The decision impugned in this appeal is

dated 27 August 2009. By the said decision, the learned

High Court Judge refused the application made by the

petitioner-appellant to have the direction issued by P10

quashed.

The facts relevant to the application made by the

petitioner-appellant for writ of cetiorari in the High

Court centres upon the document marked as P 2 and

P 10. The Chairman of the Balapitiya Pradeshiya

Sabhawa namely the 1st respondent-respondent by P2

purporting to exercise his powers under Section 107 of

the Pradeshiya Sabha Act called upon the petitioner-

appellant to tie a king coconut tree, pluck the king

coconut regularly and remove the branches of a

rukattana tree and certain banana trees. In issuing P2

the 1st respondent-respondent had purportedly acted

under Section 107 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act which

reads as follows.

(1) Where in any Pradeshiya Sabha area any

tree or any branch, trunk, fruit or other part of

a tree is causing or is likely to cause damage to

any building, or is in a condition dangerous to

the occupants if any building, or to the safety

of passers-by along any public thoroughfare,

the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha of such

area may, by a notice in writing served on the

owner or occupier of the land on which such

tree stands require such owner or occupier to

tie up and make secure, or to cut down and

remove such tree or the branch, trunk, fruit or

other part of such tree within such time as

may be specified in the notice.

According to the averments in the petition the 1 st

respondent-respondent has issued P2 calling upon the

petitioner-appellant to tie up a certain tree, pluck the

king coconut regularly, remove the branches of the

rukattana tree and the leaves of the banana trees.

Having issued P2 the 1 st respondent-respondent has

admittedly issued yet another order marked as PI O. The

1st respondent-respondent has decided to cut and

remove the rukattana tree and to tie up the thambili tree

to ensure the safety of the adjoining land owner.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner-appellant has

submitted that the 1st respondent-respondent has

amended P2 and issued P 1 0 acting on the advice of the

Assistant Commissioner of Local Government of

Southern Province. The said advice of the Assistant

Commissioner of Local Government given to the 1 st

respondent-respondent has been marked In the

proceedings before the High Court as 1 D2. According to

1D2 the 1st respondent-respondent has been directed by

the Assistant Commissioner of Local Government to

order the petitioner-appellant to cut and remove the

rukattana tree instead of his being directed to cut and

remove the branches of the said tree. In terms of

Section 107 ( 1) of the Pradeshiya Saba Act, the

Chairman of the Pradeshiya Saba is empowered to issue

a notice in writing served on the owner or occupier of a

land on which any tree or branch, trunk, fruit or other

part of the tree is causing or likely to cause damage to

any building or is in a condition dangerous to the

occupants of the building or to the safety of the passers-

by along any thoroughfare. According to Section 107 (1)

the decision as to whether such a tree or any branch or

trunk or fruit or other part of a tree is causing or likely

to cause damage to any building etc has to be decided

by the Chairman of the respective Pradeshiya Sabhawa.

The complaint of the petitioner-appellant is that instead

O'l o U5"

I.D ~ U ::I: Q.. <i. u 4

of deciding as to the dangerousness of the tree or any

branch or trunk or fruit or other part of the tree the 1 st

respondent-respondent has acted under the dictation of

a person who did not have the authority to direct him to

do so. In other words the petitioner-appellant contends

that the 1 st respondent-respondent has surrendered his

statutory right to issue a notice under Section 107 of the

relevant Act to the Assistant Commissioner of Local

Government.

In this respect the learned Counsel for the petitioner-

appellant has adverted us to the legal proposition that

an action of repository of power becomes null and void if

he acts on the external dictation that amounts to bad

faith or abusive power. In this respect the learned

Counsel has cited the treatise on administrative Law by

H W R Wade C. F Forsyth (7th edition) pages 358 2 359.

As has been contended by the learned Counsel for the

petitioner-appellant, the several objectives in enacting

Section 107 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act is to ensure

that the people living in the Pradeshiya Sabha areas do

not face any dangers by means of a tree or any branch,

trunk, fruit or other part of it. Therefore, the Provisions

of the Law which enables the Chairman of the Local

Authority to take such action to remove the danger, is

q-..... o N 00 o I.ci N

significantly a unIque power conferred on him in his

capacity as an elected member of the Local Authority.

This power, as it involves the deprivation of property

rights of one person and elimination of dangers with

regard to the living condition of another person should

be exercised with the utmost care and on clear material.

P2 is drawn up in a careless manner requiring the

petitioner-appellant to remove the banana leaves (@2mG:)G

cne.fuc 251UG:) oli5f2S)U 25J@@25) CfZiJ) endangering the house of

the neighbour.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner-appellant states

that this is demonstrative of the malafides of the 18t

respondent respondent. On this question I am totally in

agreement with the learned Counsel for the petitioner-

appellant. P2 has been issued in such a manner

without taking into consideration as to whether in fact

such leaves of the banana trees are endangering the

buildings belonging to the neighbour.

In the circumstances, it appears that the learned High

Court Judge has not considered the question of vires

and the allegation of malice. Above all, the court has

failed to consider the question that the 18t respondent-

respondent has depended to a great extent on the

dictation of the Assistant Commissioner of Local

Government to issue PIO. Further, before the issuance

of PIO the 1st respondent-respondent has failed to

withdraw P2.

Hence, it is my view that the learned High Court Judge

should have issued the writ of cetiorari to quash PIO.

Therefore, I set aside the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge and issue a writ of cetiorari quashing the

decision contained in PIO.

Subject to the above the appeal preferred by the

petitioner-appellant is allowed s~ect to co:~s.
