This is a revision application filed against the order of the learned High Court Judge

refusing bail to the suspect in respect of whom the petitioner has sought relief. The learned

State Counsel while making submissions did not seriously object to the revision application

being allowed. The learned Counsel for the petitioner adverted us to the facts reported in

the B report which reveal that the cannabis in question weighing 43kg out of the total

quantity of 83kg had been found on top of a nearby rock where the suspect resided. This

needs to be viewed as a fact favourable to the suspect in deciding as to whether he had

exclusive possession of the cannabis. The suspect has been taken into custody on

11.08.2013 and the bail application had been refused on the basis that no exceptional

circumstances had been established on his behalf. However, as at today he has been in

incarceration for almost 11 months and the minimum sentence for this offence is two years.

The Penal section also empowers the Court to impose on the suspect if he found guilty only

a fine without imposing a custodial term. In the circumstances, the confinement of the

suspect for a period of 11 months can be taken as exceptional circumstances. As such, we

revise the order of the learned High Court Judge and grant cash bail to the suspect in a sum

of Rs.25,OOOI- with two sureties.
