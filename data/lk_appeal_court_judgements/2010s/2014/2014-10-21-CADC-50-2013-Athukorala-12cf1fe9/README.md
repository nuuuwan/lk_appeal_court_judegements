maintenance application and threaten the Defendant-Petitioner that he will

hurt her when she come to Bandarawela. The Defendant-Petitioner has

made a complaint to the Embilipitiya Police Station on 11.10.2012 to that

effect and the said complaint is marked as P5. When the Defendant-

petitioner has filed this application to get the divorce action transferred due

to threats faced by her, this Court had issued notices on the Plaintiff-

Respondent on several occasions and also informed the District Court of

Bandarawela of this transfer application. However, the Plaintiff-Respondent

continued to be absent from this Court and Court is of the view that he is

purposely avoiding this Court. Court heard counsel for the Defendant-

Petitioner in support of this application and Court is of the view that this is a

fit case to be transferred from District Court of Bandarawela to District

Court of Embilipitiya. Plaintiff-Respondent has already appeared in the

Magistrate's Court of Embilipitiya in the maintenance application filed

against him. Under these circumstances, Court makes order transferring the

District Court of Bandarawela, Case No. D 2599 to District Court of

Embilipitiya.
