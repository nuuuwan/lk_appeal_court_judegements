A W A Salam, J (PICA)

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned High Court judge

dismissing an application for writ of cetiorari on the ground that the High

Court has no forum jurisdiction to entertain the same. Under the

thirteenth amendment to the Constitution the subject matter of the ,

transfers of the health services does not fall within the provincial Council

list. The learned High Court judge having considered this aspect of the

matter, came to the conclusion that it was not within the scope of the

writ jurisdiction of the High Court.

has got invalidated by reason of the issuance of the subsequent letter X
