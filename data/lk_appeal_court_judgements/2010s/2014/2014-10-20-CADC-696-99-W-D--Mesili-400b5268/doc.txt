This appeal IS against the judgment delivered by the

District Judge of Maho on 24.06.1999. Plaintiff-Respondent has filed

action in the District Court of Maho to evict the Defendant-Appellant

from the house situated in the land which was originally allocated to

one Walimuni Devage Pelis Fernando on a permit issued under the

Land Development Ordinance.

This permit bearing No. 17994 was marked as PI and

produced at the District Court action. It was evidence at the District

Court trial, that the Plaintiff-Respondent IS the son of the original

permit holder Walimuni Devage Pelis Fernando and the Defendant-

Appellant is the step sister of the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Plaintiff in his evidence submitted that he lived in the

same house with his father until his father's death In 1977. He

further said that he was cultivating the paddy lands and USIng the

other lands allocated his father under the same permit until such

time. His step sister who was given on marriage sometime back to a

village called Gabbala had come to his house to attend the funeral

of his late father and refused to go back, once the funeral was over.

That is why he decided to file an action in the District Court in

order to evict his step sister.

Plaintiff-Respondent was named as the beneficiary in the

Land Development Permit which was marked as PI by his late

father.

However when the Plaintiff-Respondent filed action 1466/L

In District Court Maho for the eviction of the Defendant-Appellant,

the action was dismissed since the Plaintiff-Appellant was not issued

with the Land Development Permit, even though he was named as the

beneficiary by his late father.

In September 1985 after the above order, Government

Agent had issued the Land Development Permit to the Plaintiff-Respondent

3

and this was confirmed at the present trial by H.M. Muthubanda Land

Officer attached to A.G.A' s office Nikaweratiya.

Counsel appearmg for the Defendant-Appellant admits

that at the time the present action was filed there was a valid Land

Development Permit issued to the Plaintiff-Respondent. However he

points out that, at once stage of the first trial Government Agent had

proposed to divide the land between the Plaintiff-Respondent and

Defendant-Appellant but he admits that after the said proposal was

made to courts, the same officer or his successor after an inquiry had

decided to issue the Land Development Permit only to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. It was established before the District Court trial that the

Plaintiff-Respondent was issued with the Land Development Permit

with regard to the land and property in question at the time the

District Court action was filed. Therefore the District Judge is correct

concluding the case in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Under these circumstances I see no reason to interfere with

the judgment dated 24.06.1999 by the District Judge Maho. The

appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs ordered. Registrar IS

directed to communicate this order to the District Judge Maho.
