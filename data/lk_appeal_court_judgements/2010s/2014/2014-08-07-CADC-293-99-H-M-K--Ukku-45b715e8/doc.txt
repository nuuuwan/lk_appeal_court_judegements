This appeal is from the judgment of the learned district

judge dated 8 February 1999 by which the action filed by

the plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

"appellant") against the defendant-respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the "respondent") for a declaration of title

was dismissed by the learned district judge. The plaintiffs

action was dismissed basically on the legal principle that

he did not have title when the action was instituted. In

the said judgment the learned district judge quite correctly

relied on the judgements in Silva vs. Hendrik Appu 1 NLR

13, Ponnamma V s Weerasooriya 11 NLR 217 and Kattu

Bawa vs vs Shanmugam 54 NLR 467.

It must be observed that the concept of exceptio reI

venditae et traditae has no application to a title acquired

under the Land Settlement Ordinance. This has been

endorsed in the case of period Periya Karuppan Chettiar

Vs Properietors and agents Ltd 47 NLR 121 and

Karunadasa Vs Abdul Hameed 60 NLR 352.

In the circumstances, the learned district judge cannot be

faulted for dismissing the plaintiffs action for want of

proof of title. Appeal dismissed.

There shall be no costs.
