This is a revision application flied by the respondent-

petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

"petitioner") challenging the propriety of the order made by

the Magistrate, which was later affirmed by the High Court

in the exercise of its revisionary powers. By the said order

made by the learned Magistrate, a conditional order was

made restraining the operations of the factory belonging to

the petitioner untjl the final determination of the application

petitioner until the final determination of the application

made to the Magistrate's Court. The said order made by the

learned Magistrate was to command the petitioners to close

up their factory on the basis that it is a public nuisance.

Admittedly the petitioner runs the factory to manufacture

charcoal briquettes using charcoal powder under the name

"Nagahawatta exports and importers. The allegation made

against the petitioner in the Magistrate Court was that

charcoal dust, particulate matter and the smoke that

emanates from the factory was injurious to the health and the

comfort of the community whose members complained of

respiratory problems and disturbance of noise and dust

emanating from the factory.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned Magistrate which

is termed as a "conditional order and injunction", the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial .High Court was

invoked to have the order made by the Magistrate suspended

or recalled. However, the learned High Court Judge having

gone in to the matter refused the application to revise the order

of the learned Magistrate on the basis that the operations at

the factory of the petitioner according to the evidence led

constitutes a public nuisance. The learned President's

Counsel who appeared for the petitioner has submitted that

no conditions ha~ been imposed by the learned Magistrate in

3

IIi

f f [ t I !

making the order marked as X5 and the said order is in fact

not a conditional order, even though it is termed that way.

The learned Counsel for the respondents submitted that the

word "conditional" does not mean that conditions are

attached to the said order, but it denotes that such an order

can be modified or rescinded during the course of the case by

the same Magistrate, who made the order or by any other

Magistrate. To buttress her argument, she cited section 92(2)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Having examined the

relevant Section, I am of the opinion that the word

"conditional" as used in Section 98 denotes that an order

made under that section can be modified or rescinded as

su bmi tted by the learned Counsel for the aggrieved party

respondent-respondents-respondents (hereinafter referred to

as the "respondents").

The next question that has to be addressed is whether the

cotnplainant-respondent-respondent was able to satisfy the

Magistrate before the issuance of the conditional order or after

the respondent made an application to have the same varied

that there was sufficient evidence to satisfy Court that there

was in fact a nuisance created by the petitioners in running

the factory in question. At the inquiry held by the Magistrate

into the application to have the order made against the

petitioners' set aside and/ or modified two officers from the

4

Ii IIi

f Ir l I f r t I !

central environmental authority gave evidence and also

produced 3 documents relating to the field the investigation

carried out with regard to the presence of a public nuisance.

The 3 reports deal with the noise level, suspended particulate

matter and organic vapour concentration relevant to the

issue. The 1st witness who gave evidence is the Senior

Environmental Officer of the Central Environmental Authority

who has prepared the field investigation report of the factory

premises in question. The second witness who testified is the

Senior Environmental Officer of the Central Environmental

Authority who has also carried out certain other investigation

with regard to the factory. It is to be observed that the order

against the petitioners' was issued to put an end to the alleged

public nuisance on the basis that the charcoal dust and

smoke said to be emitting from the factory had created a

nuisance to the public in the area. It is to ascertain the truth

of this allegation the investigation had been carried out by the

officers attached to the Central Environmental Authority. It is

significant to note that the report produced in this regard,

namely the field investigation report reveals that the tests

carried out using standard methods, show that the petitioners

have not exceeded the emission levels prescribed by law. The

learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have

failed to give sufficient weightage to the evidence of the two

senior officers testified before him prior to his refusing the

5

)

f II

l fI

application of the petitioners to set aside the order or vary the

same. The two officers have particularly testified to the fact

that no harmful chemicals or vaporizing substances are used

in the production process of the petitioners and their tests

had revealed that the noise levels and the organic vaporable

substance levels are within the safety limits prescribed by law.

In the circumstances, it would be seen that the petitioners

have adduced proof in support of their position that there was

no danger of a public nuisance created in the area and

therefore the learned Magistrate should have either set aside

or modified the order to suit the evidence adduced.

Another important question referred to in this judgment is the

failure of the learned Magistrate to limit his injunction for a

period of one month, as was sought by the complainant-

respondent-respondent. As a matter of fact, the complainant-

respondent-respondent had sought . the restraining order to

stop the public nuisance only for one month, so as to enable

the petitioners to obtain the sanction of the Environmental

Authority to run the factory in question. Although the prayer

of the complainant-respondent-respondent to have an order

issued against the petitioner only for one month, by issuing

the order without restricting it to the said period the learned

Magistrate has erred in not taking into consideration the

6

II

I

temporary nature of the relief sought by the complainant

respondent-respondent.

Had the learned Magistrate issued the restraining order only

for a limited period, the petitioner could have made an

attempt to obtain the environmental sanction of the central

environmental authority.

In any event it has to be noted that not having a licence from

the environmental authority is no ground by itself to issue an

order for the closure of the factory of the petitioner. Taking

into consideration the reports fIled by the environmental

authority and the evidence given by the two senior offIcers, I

am of the opinion that both the learned Magistrate and High

Court Judge should have taken into consideration the

harmless nature of the business operation of the petitioners

and ought to have dissolved the order relating to public

nuisance. In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the

learned Magistrate should have granted relief to the

petitioners by suspending the operation of the orders dated

15 September 2011 and 24 October 2011. For reasons stated

above it is also my opinion that the learned High Court Judge

too should have not made his order dated for July 2012. In

the circumstances, the order of the learned High Court Judge

dated 4 July 2012 set aside and the order made by the learned

7

operations at the factory. Accordingly, the petitioner is

granted relief as per prayers (b), and (C). There shall be no

costs.

President of the Court of Appeal.
