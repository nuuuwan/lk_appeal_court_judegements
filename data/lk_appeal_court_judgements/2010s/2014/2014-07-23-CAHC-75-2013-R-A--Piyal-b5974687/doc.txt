Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant states that he does

not wish to pursue this appeal but requests Court to consider

backdating the sentence. Learned Additional Solicitor General

states that he is not agreeable to the sentence being backdated for

the reason that the accused has previously been found guilty of a

similar offence had been visited with a term of imprisonment for 2

years suspended for 15 years which sentence also has been directed

to be enforced in this case.

We have taken into consideration the submissions made

on behalf of both parties. The accused in any event has been on

remand from the dated of the imposition of the sentence. As the

freedom of movement of the accused had been in fact restrained from

the date of the imposition of the sentence and that he has decided to

withdraw this appeal without wasting the precious time of this Court,

we consider it is appropriate to date back the sentence from the

date of imposition. Therefore, the sentence imposed on the accused

is backdated to take effect from 28th March 2013.

Application for withdrawal of the appeal IS allowed C\~ d,-subject to the abovel--Appeal dismissed.
