The petitioner-petitioner-appellant (appellant) invoked the

jurisdiction of the Primary Court under chapter VII of the

Primary Court Procedure Act, No 44 of 1979 complaining that

.-

the respondents-respondents-respondents (respondents)

obstructed the right of way used by him and the villages, over

a period of 10 years. He further complained that by reason of

the obstruction he was not able to take out the three wheeler

purchased him 10 months prior to the dispute.

Notices having been issued on the application filed by the

appellant, the respondents tendered their affidavits denying

that they ever of obstructed the right of the question. The

learned Magistrate having inquired into the matter refused the

application of the appellants. Aggrieved by the said

determination, the appellant invoked the revlslOnary

jurisdiction of the High Court and the learned High Court

judge refused the revision application, on the ground that no

special circumstances have been revealed to invoke the

revisionary powers of the High Court. This appeal has been

preferred against the said judgment of the learned High Court

Judge.

The learned Magistrate in his order dated 22 August 2005 has

arrived at the conclusion that it is the burden of the appellant

to establish in order to succeed in his claim for a right of cart

way that he had used the same over a period of 10 years as

servitude. Section 75 of the Primary Court Procedure Act does

not speak of the existence of servitude but the right in the

nature of a servitude.

On a perusal of the determination of the learned Magistrate it

is quite apparent that he has totally misunderstood the effect

of Section 69 of the relevant Act read together with Section 75.

For purpose of ready reference Section 75 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act is reproduced below ....

In this Part " dispute affecting land includes any

dispute as to the right to the possession of any

land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or

the boundaries thereof or as to the right to

cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the

right to the crops or produce of any land, or part of

a land, or as to any right in the nature of a

servitude affecting the land and any reference to "

land" in this Part includes a reference to any

building standing thereon. (Emphasis Added)

In the light of the above definition is quite clear that there is

no burden on the appellant to establish servitude strictly as he

has to prove a civil dispute. It is open to persons to prove such

a right either as in the case of a civil dispute or that he

enjoyed the right at the time of obstruction. This interpretation

has been given in the case of Ananda Sarath Paranagama vs

D. Sarath Paranagama and Others CA. (PHC) APN 117/2013 -

C.A. Minute dated 07.08.2014.

It was explicitly held in the above case that it is left to a party

claiming a right of way to establish his right for purpose of

obtaining a declaration under Section 69 aforementioned in

two ways. Firstly, he may resort to the ordinary way of proof as

is done in a right of the case in a civil court. In the absence of

such proof, he may also prove have the satisfaction of court

that the right of way in question had been enjoyed or used by

him for the time being when the obstruction was placed. To

this extent the learned Magistrate has misdirected himself on

the question of law and the learned High Court judge has

failed to address his mind. Had the learned judge of the High

Court properly addressed his mind to this issue, he could

possibly not have come to the conclusion that the appellant

has failed to adduce exceptional circumstances.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the appellant is

entitled to succeed in this revision application. Accordingly,

the revision application is allowed and it is sent back to the

Learned High Court Judge to consider the merits of it and

enter judgment after hearing both parties.

There shall be no costs.
