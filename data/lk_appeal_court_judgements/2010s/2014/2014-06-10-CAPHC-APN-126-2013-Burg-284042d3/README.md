Heard Counsel for the petitioner in support of the application and

the learned State Counsel in opposition.

This is an application to revise the order of the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo dated 08.08.2013. By the said order the suspect who had

been reported to have committed or was concerned in the commission of an

offence under section 4S(c) of the Immigration and Emigration Act was refused

to be enlarged on bail. When he was refused bail the suspect had been on

remand for more than a year. Significantly, the minimum sentence, if found

guilty under section 4S(c) of the Immigration and Emigration Act is one year

rigorous imprisonment and the maximum five years. It is to be observed that

there was proof of exceptional circumstance for the suspect to be released on

bail as he had been in incarceration for more than one year which is the

minimum custodial sentence that could be imposed on him. As at today, the

suspect has been on remand for one year and eleven months which is

equivalent to two fifth of the maximum custodial sentence that can be imposed

on the suspect. This means that if an application to the High Court is made

today, the learned High Court Judge will have no option but to release the

suspect on bail, on the basis that he had been on remand for almost two years.

Therefore, to refer the matter back to the High Court to make an

appropriate order would prolong the agony and involves waste of precious time

of that Court and the suspect having to go through the inquiry once again.

Learned Counsel for the suspect submitted that the suspect in this case lives

in abject poverty which I understand that he cannot afford the luxury of

having to go through another bail application in the High Court.

In the circumstances, we consider the fact of the suspect

(Kurukulasuriya Ranil Peiris) being on remand for one year and eleven months

as proof of exceptional circumstances and revise the order of the learned High

Court Judge dated 08th August 2013 by granting cash bail in a sum of Rs.

10,000/= (Ten thousand Rupees) and a sum of Rs.1,000,000/=(One Million

Rupees) surety bail with six sureties from and among the family members of

the suspect to be approved by the learned Magistrate. The suspect is directed

to report to the Magistrate's Court of Negombo until 05.12.2014 on every

Friday between 9.00a.m. and 2.00 p.m. After 05.12.2014 he is required to

report to the Magistrate's Court of Negombo, in the same manner, on the last

working day of every month. The Registrar of the Magistrate's Court is

required to maintain a separate register for the suspect to report to that Court.

An additional copy of this order to be dispatched to the Magistrate

of Negombo to give effect to the order permitting the suspect to report to Court

as laid down above.
