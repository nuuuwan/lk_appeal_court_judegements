BEFORE : VIJITH K. Malalgoda. PC, J (PiCA),

: A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

COUNSEL : D.Karunarathne for the Defendant - Appellant,

B.O.P. Jayewardene for the Substituted Plaintiff - Respondent,

C. Ranawaka for Substituted 6th Defendant- Respondent.

Supported Re- Listing Application On: 10.10.2014

OderOn :20.10.2014

Vijith K. Malalgoda. PC, J (PICA).

On 26/04/2012 when this matter came up for Argument, it was brought to the Notice of court

that the 6th Defendant -Respondent was dead. Since then this case has gone down nine days

for substitution. In all nine days when this matter came up counsel for Appellant had moved

further time for substItution. On 09/12/2013 when this matter came up for substitution for the

09th occasion, it was recorded that "Counsel moves for further date to support this application

with certified copies" and the matter has been postponed for 13/12/2013 for support.

When the matter came up for support 13/12/2013 Defendant Appellant was absent and

unrepresented and therefore the court abetted the Appeal.

On 18/12/2013 counsel for the appellant had filed a motion along with a petition from a

different counsel and paragraph 01 ofthe petition read as follow.

"On the very next date 10/12/2013 a certified copy obtained from the Registra General Was

filed in the court by way of a motion and this was minuted in the record. On 13/12/2013 the

court had inadvertently decided to abate the appeal on the ground that the Appellant has failed

to take step with regard to substitution, when all the necessary documents have been field and

when the Appellant was in the court and without even calling his name. His counsel was

indisposed that day, but another counsel was arranged. Unfortunately by the time he rushed to

the court the case was abetted".

Paragraph 09 of the said petition read as follow.

"Therefore this order to abate the Appeal on 13/12/2013 is clearly PER INCURIUM as it will

cause immense hardship and irreparable loss to the Appellant for no fault of him. A PER

INCURIUM Order can be vacates by the same court and seek permission to support with

authorities on this aspect and on the issue of certified copies".

As pointed out about the journal entry dated 13/12/2013 is very clear, that when the case was

called the Appellant was absent and unrepresented. The order made by court to abet the case

cannot be PER INCURIAM order. It was correct and lawful decision by court

However the counsel who filed the petition had submitted that when the case was called, the

Appellant was present in court and the counsel for the Appellant not available due to sickness.

The counsel arranged to appear was late. There was no affidavit in support of the above

position at least from the Appellant.

This motion was supported before us on 10/10/2014 but even on this day there is nothing

before us to support the above version. When a counsel submits a very serious allegation on

the conducted of this court, this court taken very serious view on the allegation and therefore it

is duty of the counsel to support his version by supporting documents.

In absence of any such document, I see no reason doubt the order made by this court on

13/12/2013. This case has gone down for nine occasions for substitution of the 06th Defendant-

Respondents and therefore it is correct for this court to abet the case when Appellant is absent

and unrepresented I see no reason to interfere with the decision of this court on 13/12/2013.

Application for relisting is dismissed.

Appeal stand abetted. No cost is order.

Judge of the court of Appeal
