The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed an application dated 13/06/2016, in the Magistrates Court of

Hambantota to enforce a demolition order on an unauthorized structure in terms of

Section 28A (5) of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as

Page 2 ofB

amended), (referred to as the UDA law) against the Respondent-Petitioner-

Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner). Being aggrieved by the said

order of the learned Magistrate, the Petitioner filed a revision application in the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden in Hambantota in case

bearing No. HCRA-25/20 17. The Petitioner is before this Court seeking to set

aside the judgment dated 16/0112019, delivered by the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of Hambantota in the said case.

The Respondent's application before the learned Magistrate was made in

terms of Section 28A (3) of the UDA law.

Section 28A (3) reads thus: -

"(a) Where any person has failed to comply with any requirement contained in

any written notice issued under subsection (I) within the time specified in the

notice or within such extended time as may have been granted by the

Authority, the Authority may, by way of petition and affidavit, apply to the

Magistrate to make an Order authorizing the Authority to -

(a) to discontinue the use of any land or building;

(b) to demolish or alter any building or work;

(c) to do all such other acts as such person was required to do by such notice,

as the case may be and the Magistrate shall after serving notice on the

person who had failed to comply with the requirements of the Authority

Page 3 of 8

I

under subsection (1), if he is satisfied to the same effect, make or der

accordingly.

(b) If such person undertakes to discontinue the use of the land or building a r to

demolish or alter the building or work, or to do such other acts as are refer red

to in paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of section 28A, the Magistrate may, if he

thinks fit, postpone the operation of the Order for such time not exceeding two

months as he thinks suffiCient for the purpose of giving such person an

opportunity of complying with such requirement. "

As required by the UDA law, the Respondent has complied with the

statutory requirements by serving a written notice on the Petitioner in terms of

Section 21lA tl) to be read with Section 8J of the UDA law, in respect of cert am

development activity commenced contrary to the terms and conditions of the

. . permit. The said notice was served on the basis that such development activity IS

relevant to the business premises namely 'Kodithuwakku Tyre Centre' situated 111

the limits of a Urban Development Area, by order of the Minister published in the

Gazette notifkation bearing No. 747/7, dated 29/1211992, marked "X4".

According to Section 3 of the UDA law;

"(I) Where the Minister is of opinion that any area is suitable for developme nt,

the Minister. may, by Order published in the Gazelle, declare such area to

an Urban Development Area (hereinafter referred to as a "developm

area ").

(2) An Order under subsection (I) declaring an area as a development area shall

define that area by setting out the metres and bounds of such area.

(3) The Authority shall develop every development area for the better physical and

economic utilization of such area. "

The Respondent submits that the alleged development activity is within the

urban development area of the Ambalantota Divisional Secretariat by reference to

the said Gazette notification bearing No. 74717 dated 29/12/1992, marked "X4".

The position taken by the Petitioner is that the said business premises fall within

the Puhulyaya Grama Niladhari Division of the Ambalantota Divisional

Secretariat and therefore the said Grama Niladhari Division does not fall within

the Gazette Notification No. 74717, dated 29 / 12/1992. Accordingly, the Petitioner

submits that the Respondent has no locus standi to bring this action against the

Petitioner. In this context the Court is called upon to decide as to whether the

Respondent has a cause of action against the Petitioner.

The State Counsel in written submissions filed of record has drawn

attention to the relevant gazette notification marked "X4", which refers to No.

179, lhalagama Grama Niladhari Division and No. 159, Baminiyawe1a Grama

Niladhari Division which fails within the Ambalantota Divisional Secretariat. It is

submitted that the business premises of the Petitioner is situated at Malpeththawa

which is within the boundary description of No. 159, Baminiyawela Grama

Niladhari Division.

Page 5 of 8

Section 3 of the UDA law clearly states that, "declaring an area as a

development area shall define that area by setting out the metres and bounds of

such area". Therefore, a plain reading of Section 3 of the UDA law makes it

absolutely clear that the metres and bounds setting out to define No. 159,

Baminiyawela Grama Niladhari Division will not apply to the metres and bounds

setting out to define Puhulyaya Grama Niladhri Division, which in itself is a

separate Grama Niladhari Division. The Counsel for the Petitioner has drawn

attention to letter dated 01/03/2017, marked "P7", where the Ambalantota

Divisional Secretary has certified that the business premises belonging to the

Petitioner is situated within No. 146, Puhulyaya Grama Niladhari Division. The

Respondent does not deny the facts contained in the said letter.

In the circumstances, document marked "PT', leaves me with no doubt that

the impugned business premises situated at Malpeththawa is within the Puhulyaya

Grama Niladhari Division and not within the development area envisaged in the

metres and bounds of No. \59, Baminiyawela Grama Niladhari Division.

Therefore, I find that the said gazette notification dated 291l2/1992, marked "X4",

has no application to the Petitioner's business premises and therefore, the

demolition order made by the learned Magistrate is erroneous.

The learned High Court Judge has refused to consider letter marked "PT',

on the basis that the said document was introduced for the first time during the

Page 6 of8

proceedings before the High Court and has justified the findings of the learned

Magistrate on the facts disclosed before that Court.

The State Counsel contends that the failure to submit letter marked "P7" at

the inquiry before the learned Magistrate should be construed as a breach of the

Principle of 'Uberimea Fide ' (the principle of Utmost good faith) and together

with want of exceptional circumstances, defeats the cause of the Petitioner.

The learned High Court Judge has refused to consider document marked ----.....

"PT, on the basis that it was introduced during the proceedings in that Court. It is

observed that the document marked "PT came into existence after the order of

demolition was made by the learned Magistrate. In the circumstances, [ do not

think it is prudent to deprive the Petitioner of a hearing on the said document or be

considered being in the breach of coming before this Court with clean hands.

It is well settled law that an aggrieved party will not be deprived the right

of revisionary jurisdiction, where his substantial rights have been compromised

due to a decision which is manifestly erroneous.

In Urban Development Authority Vs. Wejayalllxmi (2006) 3 SIR 62,

Wimalachandra, J. cited with approval the case of Soysa Vs. Silva (2000) 2 SIR

235, Where it was held that,

"the power given to a superior Court by way of revision is wide enough to give it

the righl 10 revise any order made by an original Court. lis objeci is Ihe due

Page 7 of 8

administration o/justice and the correction 0/ errors sometimes committed by the

Court itselfin order to avoid miscarriage a/justice. "

As noted earlier the Gazette notification dated 29/12/1992, marked "X4",

has no application to the business premises of the Petitioner since it is not within

the metres and bounds of the development area contemplated under the sa~id~==~~

Gazette notification. In effect, if the Respondent has no cause of action against the~~~~~

Petitioner the action fails on the ground that the Respondent does not have a locus

standi to institute and maintain this action. (The Ceylon Mercantile Union

The Insurance Corporation 0/ Sri Lanka (1980 NLR 309). Therefore it IS

manifestly clear that there exists a failure of justice to be corrected by invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

[n all the above circumstances, I set aside the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge and the order of the learned Magistrate and allow the application.

Application allowed.
