annexed to the petition marked 'P31c' issued by the 1

st Respondent in

respect of premises No. 27, Vauxhall Street, Colombo 2.3

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 2nd Petitioner is the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, which has

been established under and in terms of the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment Act No. 47 of 1949. The general objects of the 2nd Petitioner, as

set out in Section 2 of the Act, are to procure and supply the requirements of

co-operative societies and to carryon business as exporters and importers of,

and as wholesale and retail dealers, in goods of every description.

The 2nd Petitioner has claimed that since 1993, it has been incurring heavy

financial losses and that it has been operating on funds provided to it by the

General Treasury as well as by the rental income earned from leasing out

buildings owned by it. The 2

nd Petitioner has claimed further that it functions at

very low profit margins and that it has not been able to reduce its accumulated

losses.

The 2

nd Petitioner owns several buildings in Colombo from where it carries out

its business operations. It appears from the material provided by the

Petitioners that the 2

nd Petitioner has had issues with the 1st Respondent since

1998 over the non-payment of rates on the buildings owned by the 2nd

Petitioner.

This application relates to the non-payment of rates in respect of three

premises belonging to the 2nd Petitioner, bearing assessment Nos. 25, 25/1 and

27, Vauxhall Street, Colombo 2. The material filed by the Petitioners

demonstrate that since 2003, the 2nd Petitioner has not paid the rates due on

the above three premises, as and when such payment became due, even

though the 2nd Petitioner had in fact made payments on a sporadic basis. The

position of the Petitioners that payments have been made, although not on

the due date, has been admitted by the Respondents.

By a letter dated ih July 2012 annexed to the petition marked 'P25', the

Municipal Treasurer had informed the Chairman of the 2nd Petitioner that the

following sums are payable as arrears:

Premises No. Amount outstanding as rates as at 30th June 2012

25 Rs. 6,281,268

25/1 Rs. 1,776,544

27 Rs. 8,390,256

After 'P25' was issued, the 2nd Petitioner had made the following payments in

2012:

Date Premises Amount Period for which payment has been

paid - Rs. made

19.07.2012 27 750750

25 334950

19.10.2012 27 750750 4th Quarter -2012

25 334950 4th Quarter - 2012

26.10.2012 25/1 231000 All four quarters of 2012

In spite of the 2nd Petitioner making the aforesaid payments, the 1st

Respondent had issued the three seizure notices dated 11th January 2013

marked 'P31a', 'P31b' and 'P31c' in respect of the aforementioned three

premises, seeking to seize and sell the said properties in order to recover the

following sums of money:

Premises No. Amount outstanding as rates as at 30th September

2012

25 Rs. 6,264,520

25/1 Rs. 1,845,844

27 Rs. 8,382,719

The said seizure notices, which have only been addressed to the

'owner/occupier' and not to the 2nd Petitioner, read as follows:

"It is hereby notified in terms of the Municipal Council's Ordinance that

the movable or immovable property of the under-mentioned property will

be seized after 14 days from the date hereof, for the recovery of arrears of

rates and warrant costs as per details given below."

Aggrieved by the issuance of the said seizure notices, the Petitioners invoked

the Writ jurisdiction of this Court, seeking the aforementioned relief.

The Petitioners are challenging the issuance of the said seizure notices on

several grounds. The principal ground urged by the learned President's Counsel

for the Petitioners is that a seizure notice must be preceded by a warrant, and

that as the 1st Respondent has failed to issue a warrant as required by the

6

provisions of the Municipal Council Ordinance (the Ordinance), the seizure

notices are bad in law, and are liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

A consideration of the above argument requires this Court to examine Part XII

of the Ordinance which contains provisions relating to the imposition of rates,

and the manner of recovery of rates which are in arrears.

In terms of Section 230(1), "every Municipal Council shall, from time to time, so

often as it thinks necessary, make and assess, with the sanction of the Minister,

any rate or rates on the annual value of all houses and buildings of every

description, and of all lands and tenements whatsoever within the

Municipality."

In terms of Section 235(1), "The Council shall cause to be kept a book, to be

called the "Assessment Book", in which the annual value of each house,

building, land, or tenement within the Municipality shall be entered every year,

and shall cause to be given public notice thereof and the place where the

assessment book may be inspected"

Section 235(3) requires a notice of assessment to be served on every occupier

of the building that is being assessed. Sub Sections (4)-(7) of Section 235

provides for objections to be filed against each assessment in accordance with

the procedure specified therein. In terms of Section 235(8), "Every assessment

against which no objection is taken shall be final for the year"

This Court observes that the Petitioners have not, in their petition, taken up

the position that the 2nd Petitioner was not served with notices of assessment

7

Website Copy

nor have the Petitioners produced any material to establish that the 2nd

Petitioner objected to the assessments that were issued to it over the years.

The assessments that have been made in respect of the said three properties

must therefore be considered to be final.

Section 252{1} of the Ordinance provides for the recovery of rates which are in

arrears. The relevant parts of Section 252{1} are re-produced below:

"If the amount of any rate assessed under this Ordinance or the amount of

any tax imposed thereunder is not paid into the Municipal office within

such time as the Council may direct, it shall be the duty 0/ the

Commissioner to issue a warrant signed by him to some collector or other

officer of the Council named therein directing him-

(a) in the case of non-payment of any rate, to levy such rate and the costs

of recovery by seizure and sale of all and singular the movable or

immovable property of the proprietor or of any joint praprietor, of the

premises on account of which such rate may be due, and of all movable

property, to whomsoever the same may belong, which may be found in or

upon any such premise; ..... " {emphasis added}

Section 252{2} of the Ordinance specifies that every warrant issued under sub-

section {I} shall be in the form contained in the Fifth Schedule, which reads as

follows:

"Whereas, the persons named in the schedule underwritten have been

rated by the Municipal Council at the sums opposite their respective

names: and whereas, the said persons have made default in the payment

8

Website Copy

of the said several sums to the Council, and the said sums are still due and

owing, although notice demanding payment of the same was served on

the said persons:

These are therefore, to order you forthwith to seize the property of the

said persons (or the moveable property of any person whomsoever which

you may find in or upon the premises in the said schedule mentioned); and

if within the space of eight clear days next after the said seizures

respectively, the said several sums set opposite to their respective names,

together with the costs leviable under Section 255 of the said Ordinance,

shall not be paid, then to sell the property seized by public auction, and

the surplus (if any), after payments of the rate due and costs, to restore to

the owner or any joint owner of the property so sold; and that you do

certify to me on or before the .... day of .... what you shall have done by

virtue of this warrant." (emphasis added)

In terms of Section 256, what can be sold by public auction is any property

seized in pursuance of any warrant issued under this Part, thus confirming the

position that the issuance of a warrant is a condition precedent to the seizure

of any property.

On a plain reading of Section 252(1) of the Ordinance, it is clear to this Court

that a revenue officer or collector derives the power and the authority to seize

any property only upon being authorized to do so by the Municipal

Commissioner. Such authority must be given by way of the warrant issued in

terms of Section 252(1). The issuance of a warrant by the Municipal

Commissioner is therefore a condition precedent to steps being taken to seize

9

any property. This position is reinforced by the provisions of Section 256 and

the 5th Schedule. This Court therefore takes the view that in the absence of a

warrant, no steps can be taken to seize the property for non-payment of rates.

This Court must now consider if a warrant has been issued by the Municipal

Commissioner in this application, prior to the issuance of the said seizure

notices. The Petitioners have specifically pleaded in paragraph 84{f) of the

petition that a warrant has not been issued in terms of Section 252(1) prior to

the issuance of the seizure notices marked 'P31a' - 'P31c'. Even though the 1st

- 5th Respondents have denied the averments in the said paragraph, a copy of

the warrant, which the 1st - 5th Respondents ought to have in their possession,

has not been produced with the Statement of Objections of the said

Respondents. In the written submissions filed on its behalf, the 1st -5th

Respondents have accused the 2nd Petitioner of uttering a falsehood that no

warrant has been issued by the Municipal Council, and stated that the warrant

has been served on the occupants of the premises. If that be so, it was open to

the 1st - 5th Respondents to have produced a copy of the warrant so served, or

at least tendered an affidavit of the person to whom the 1st Respondent has

issued the warrant, confirming that fact. The Respondents have failed to do so,

and have therefore failed to rebut the argument of the Petitioners that there

has not been compliance with the mandatory provisions of Section 252(1).

In Phoenix Fashions (Pvt) Limited vs The Municipal Council. Moratuwa and

others4 this Court, having considered the provisions of Section 252(1) held as

follows:

CA (Writ) Application No. 2185/2004; CA Minutes of 19'" September 2005; per Sisira De Abrew J, with Sripavan, J (as he then was) agreeing.

"A close reading of the said Section reveals that if an amount of any rate

assessed under the Municipal Councils Ordinance or an amount of any tax

imposed under the said Ordinance is not paid to the Municipal Office, the

Municipal Commissioner has the power to issue a warrant to some

collector or any other officer of the Municipal Council directing him to take

steps to recover such outstanding dues. These steps are stated in sub

paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 252 of the Ordinance. Thus, the Revenue

Inspector derives power only upon a warrant addressed to him signed by

the Municipal Commissioner being issued. In the present cose, has the 2nd

Respondent, the Municipal Commissioner issued such a warrant? The

Respondents have failed to produce any warrant. Therefore, this Court has

to conclude that the 2nd Respondent has not issued a warrant and the 1st

Respondent has not followed the procedure laid down in Section 252 of

the said Ordinance. Thus, the Revenue Inspector of the 1st Respondent

Council has issued the seizure notice without having any legal power or

any authority. Having considered the above matters, I hold that the 1st

Respondent Council has not followed the procedure laid down in law in

issuing the seizure notice 'P14'. Therefore, the seizure notice is illegal

insofar as it affects the Petitioner. " (emphasis added)

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the seizure notices

marked 'P31a' - 'P31c' have been issued without following the procedure laid

down in the Municipal Council Ordinance. The Municipal Commissioner has

acted ultra vires his powers by issuing the said seizure notices without

complying with Section 252(1}. Hence, this Court is of the view that the said

seizure notices are liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

,

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner has also submitted that

there has not been a proper computation of the sums of money due as rates in

respect of the said premises. In view of the above conclusion reached by this

Court, the necessity for this Court to consider the said submission does not

arise.

This Court however observes that the 2nd Petitioner was in arrears of rates in

respect of the aforementioned three premises since 2005 - vide letters dated

8th May 2007, ih June 2007, 20th September 2007 and 1ih December 2007,

annexed to the petition marked 'PiS', 'P16', 'P19' and 'P19a', respectively. The

Petitioners have not disputed the sums of money specified by the l 't

Respondent in the said letters and had only sought a waiver of penalties and to

be able to pay the said sums of money by way of instalments.

The Petitioners have produced a series of invoices, marked as 'P22' which

establishes that payments have been made in respect of the said premises

from 2008 - 2013. The said payments have been set off against the rates due

for the quarter in which the said payments have been made, as opposed to

setting it off against the arrears prevailing on the date of payment. This Court

finds it difficult to understand the reason why, for example, the l 't Respondent

accepted the payment made in January 2013 in respect of premises No. 27 as

being the rates due for all four quarters of 2013, and even offered the 2nd

Petitioner a discount of 10% which is generally offered if rates are paid for the

entire year before 31't January 2013,5 and provided there are no arrears, if the

Petitioners were in arrears for periods prior to 2013. This practice appears to

have continued even with the payments that have been made after the

'Vide Section 230(3) of the Municipal Council Ordinance.

institution of this application.6 This Court is therefore of the view that the 1st

Respondent should make available to the 2nd Petitioner, a proper computation

of the sums of money due as rates on the properties which are the subject

matter of this application, prior to taking steps in terms of the law.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues the Writs of Certiorari prayed for

in paragraphs (b) - (d) of the prayer to the petition, quashing the seizure

notices marked 'P31a' - 'P31c'. This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
