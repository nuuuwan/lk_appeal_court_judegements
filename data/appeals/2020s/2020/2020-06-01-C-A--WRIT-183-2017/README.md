At all times material to this application the Petitioner was a Temporary Sergeant of the Sri

Lanka Air Force and received a severe reprimand as a result of a Court Martial of which the 1st

to 4th Respondent were members.

A Summary Trial was commenced around 16.08.2013 against the Petitioner and a charge sheet

issued containing a charge under section 129(1) of the Air Force Act No. 41 of 1949 as amended

(Air Force Act). The main charge was that the Petitioner during the period 01.02.2011 to

31.07.2013 being the manager of the Judo team of the Air Force harassed certain identified Air

Women. Although the Petitioner pleaded not guilty, at the end of the Summary Trial he was

convicted and sentenced to serve 48 days detention and removal from the Air Force on the

grounds that service is no longer required.

The Petitioner refused to accept this verdict and sought a Court Martial to hear and determine

the charges against him. Thereafter a District Court Martial was appointed and the Petitioner

was found guilty of the charges levied against him and imposed a punishment of "Severe

Reprimand".

The Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the District Court Martial

and a Writ of Certiorari quashing the punishment imposed on the Petitioner. The Petitioner

seeks to assail the decisions on the grounds that the summing up of the Judge Advocate

contains misdirection and non-directions.

In this context it is important at the outset to ascertain the scope of judicial review in respect of

a conviction or sentence entered by a Court Martial.

In Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore Dharmasiriwardene & Others [(2007) 1

Sri.L.R. 24 at 33] Sisira De Abrew J. held that:

"In an application for a writ of certiorari in respect of a conviction or sentence entered by

a Court Martial the defense of review is not the same as in an appeal from a conviction

of a Criminal Court judicial review will lie by way of certiorari only in respect of the

legality of the conviction or sentence. The merit of the finding will not be subject to

review by Certiorari. (Emphasis added)

Page 5 of 9

I am in respectful agreement with the principle enunciated.

Nature of a Court Martial

It is observed that all legislation in Sri Lanka relating to the three armed forces have provided

for Court Martial. I would like to begin considering the case presented by the Petitioner after

examining the nature of a Court Martial.

Sections 204 to 238 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regulate the conduct of a Trial by Jury.

Sections 230 and 231 specify duties of the judge. Section 229 deals with summing up the

evidence.

Upon a careful consideration of the provisions in Part IX of the Air Force Act dealing with Court

Martial and in particular the provisions of section 54 therein dealing with the powers and duties

of a Judge-Advocate including the need to summing up, it appears to me that Trial by Jury and

Court Martial are similar in nature.

The role of the Judge in Trial by Jury is taken by the Judge Advocate in a Court Martial. Both

Trial by Jury and Court Martial provide for a prosecution counsel and a defense counsel. The

place of the jury in a Trial by Jury is taken by the members of the Court Martial. The Code of

Criminal Procedure does not require the jury to give reasons for its decision. Nor does the Navy

Act require a Court Martial to give reasons for its findings and sentence.

In fact, in Jayanetti v. Martinus and others (71 N.L.R. 41 at 49-50) the Supreme Court after

examining the corresponding provisions in the Navy Act held as follows:

Section 39 of the Navy Act prescribes the powers and duties of the Judge-Advocate in

court martial proceedings. They are inter alia, to give advice on questions of law or

procedure during the proceedings of a court martial, to give advice on any matter

before the court, to ensure that the accused does not suffer any disadvantage at his

trial, and at the conclusion of the case to sum up the evidence and advise the court

upon the law relating to the case. The reason why such powers and duties are vested

and imposed on the Judge-Advocate is almost obvious. A court martial, although it has

Page 6 of 9

the power to try and punish offences, which if committed by civilians would be tried by

the ordinary courts, is not ordinarily composed of officers with legal knowledge or

judicial experience. In fact the court in the present case was composed of two supply

officers and one surgeon officer. It is because of this lack of legal or judicial training and

experience that the function of advising courts martial is committed by law to the Judge-

Advocate. Indeed, his functions are comparable to those of a Judge of Assize in cases

tried by Jury. Although it is the function of the Jury to decide all questions of fact, the

law requires that before the Jury deliberates on the facts, the Judge must sum up to

them the evidence. Section 39 (d) imposes a similar requirement in the case of a trial by

court martial:-

" (d) At the conclusion of the case he shall, unless both he and the court martial

consider it unnecessary, sum up the evidence and advise the court martial upon

the law relating to the case before the court martial proceeds to deliberate upon

its finding." (Emphasis added)

The Supreme Court quashed the finding of the Court Martial and the order of punishment on

the basis that the failure of the Judge-Advocate to perform the statutory duty, explicitly

imposed by section 39 (d) of the Navy Act, to sum up on the evidence before the court

deliberates on its finding is a fatal illegality.

This may well be the reason for the learned counsel for the Petitioner to place heavy reliance

on the summing up of the Judge Advocate and the alleged misdirection and non-direction

therein to assail the decision of the Court Martial and the punishment imposed on him.

The grounds advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner are that the Judge Advocate

has failed to sum up to the Court Martial about the maintainability of the charge against the

Petitioner, since the initial charge sheet issued contained a different charge to that of the

charge before the Court Martial, that the Court Martial lacked jurisdiction to try the Petitioner

without the provisions of section 40 of the Air Force Act being followed after the charge had

been amended/changed.

Page 7 of 9

Firstly, I agree with the submission made by the learned Senior State Counsel that there was in

fact no change in the substance of the charges framed against the Petitioner though two

different sections in the Air Force Act has been referred to. The essence of the offence of which

the Petitioner was charged is harassment by means of his words and action against two female

Air Force women in the Judo team. The offence could have been framed either under section

129(1) or 126(1) (a) of the Air Force Act, both of which were triable by a Court Martial and

therefore no material change was made.

In any event, it is observed that the Petitioner did not object to the procedure adopted and in

particular did not object to the Court Martial proceedings. In Kumaresan v. Pannawela and

Others [(1990) 2 Sri.L.R. 181] the petitioner and two others of the Air Force were arraigned

before a Court Martial on two counts that by ill treating and harassing Flying Officer

Samarasinghe they did behave in a manner prejudicial to good order and Air Force discipline in

terms of section 129(1) of the Air Force Act as in this case. A preliminary objection was taken

that the charges were bad for duplicity and failure to comply with Regulation 21 of the

Regulations under the Air Force Act. The Court Martial on a ruling by the Judge Advocate stated

that the objections would be ruled upon at the conclusion but this was not done. Court held (at

page 184) that had the petitioner not taken this objection at the outset he could not be heard

to complain later against those charges.

A similar approach was taken in Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore

Dharmasiriwardene & Others [(2007) 1 Sri.L.R. 24 at 31] where Sisira De Abrew J. held that:

In any event the Petitioner is now precluded from raising any objection to the charge

sheet since such objection was not raised before the Court Martial. This view is

supported by the judgment of Justice Sharvananda (as he then was) in the case of

Nagalingam v Luxman de Mel. His Lordship remarked thus: "Further the petitioner,

having participated in the proceeding without any objection and having taken the

chance of the final outcome of the proceedings, is precluded from raising any objection

to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Labour to make a valid order after the zero

Page 8 of 9

hour. The jurisdictional defect, if any, has been cured by the petitioner's consent and

acquiescence." [Emphasis added]

To formulate it in another way, the Petitioner took part in the Court Martial without objecting

to the procedure adopted. Now the Petitioner cannot be heard to state otherwise as it would

amount to allowing him to Approbate and Reprobate.

As Sharvananda J. (as he was then) held in Ranasinghe v. Premawardene [(1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 63]:

"The rationale of the principle appears to be that a defendant cannot approbate and

reprobate. In cases where the doctrine of 'approbation and reprobation' applies, the

person concerned has a choice of two rights, either of which he is at liberty to adopt,

but not both. Where the doctrine does apply, if the person to whom the choice belongs

irrevocably and with full knowledge accepts one he cannot afterwards assert the other,

he cannot affirm and disaffirm"

I hold that the Petitioner cannot raise any defect in the charge sheet now without

having raised it before the Court Martial.

The Petitioner further contends that the Judge Advocate failed to sum up properly to the Court

Martial how to evaluate the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. I see no merit in this

submission since the summing up covers this aspect.

The Petitioner also complains that the virtual complainant H.N. Damayanthi gave evidence as

the 5th witness whereas the corroborative witnesses gave evidence prior to the virtual

complainants and that this amounts to corroboration in advance which is not recognized by our

law. This submission is untenable in the circumstances of the case. Sections 136(2) and 157 of

the Evidence Ordinance govern the order in which witnesses may be called on the basis of

admissibility of evidence.

Page 9 of 9

However, neither of them is engaged in the circumstances of this case. In such a situation the

practice is that the right to determine the order in which witnesses may be called is given to

Counsel subject to overriding discretion given to Court [Bandaranaike v. Premadasa (1979) 2

Sri.L.R. 369].

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that the Court Martial failed to

consider the credibility of the main witness. Again I see no merit in this submission given that

the Judge Advocate has properly summed up as to how to evaluate the credibility of the

prosecution witnesses. Once that duty is performed judicial review cannot be extended to

decide whether the Court Martial acted in accordance with the said direction or not.

A further point was made on the contradictory nature of the prosecution witnesses. The Judge

Advocate has in his summing up properly directed the Court Martial on the credibility of

witnesses.

Thereafter it is up to the Court Martial to decide the creditworthiness of witnesses and evaluate

their evidence. This Court cannot step into the shoes of the Court Martial, as much as a Court

does not do to a Jury, and determine that issue differently. The Court Martial is the final

authority on the facts of the case.

For all the aforesaid reasons, the application is dismissed. I make no order as to costs.
