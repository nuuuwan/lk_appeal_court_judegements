Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners are employees of the Excise Department. The

dispute pertaining to this application relates to their transfers.

The annual transfers of the Excise Department had been initially

done according to the scheme of transfers marked P19. This

scheme of transfers was first replaced by P22 and P23;

thereafter, by P33 and P34. At the time material to this

application, the schemes P33 and P34 were in force, the latter

being applicable to Excise Chief Inspectors and Excise

Inspectors, and the former to other Excise employees. By P38

and P39, the transfers relevant to this dispute were given effect

to be operative from 01.01.2019. The Petitioners have filed this

application seeking to quash by certiorari P38 and P39, together

with the attachments marked P38(a) and P39(a), on the basis

the said decisions are a nullity. Let me now consider why the

Petitioners say so.

It is common ground the transfers of Public Officers are

governed by the procedural Rules made by the Public Service

Commission, published in the Gazette Extraordinary

No.1589/30 dated 20.02.2009 marked P18(a). In terms of Rule

194, a Public Officer can be transferred only by the Public

Service Commission or by an Authority with Delegated Power.

Insofar as the Excise Department is concerned, the said power

has been delegated by the Public Service Commission to the 1st

Respondent Commissioner General of Excise.

5

Rules 197-209 provide for setting up an Annual Transfer

Committee, and Rules 210-211 for setting up an Annual

Transfer Proposals Review Committee. Rule 212 says the 1st

Respondent who is the Authority with Delegated Power shall

issue annual transfer orders taking into consideration the

proposals of the annual transfer committee and the

recommendations of the annual transfer proposals review

committee. There is no dispute that decisions to transfer shall

ultimately be taken by none other than the 1st Respondent,

upon having taken into account the proposals of the Annual

Transfer Committee and the recommendations of the Annual

Transfer Proposals Review Committee.

The Petitioners say P38 and P39 are a nullity because the

decisions to transfer therein have been taken not by the 1st

Respondent but by the Annual Transfer Committee. This

complaint is not unfounded. By the 1st paragraph of P38 and

P39, it is abundantly clear the decisions to transfer have been

taken not by the 1st Respondent but by the Annual Transfer

Committee, and the 1st Respondent is merely announcing the

decision of the Annual Transfer Committee. He has not taken

an independent decision upon the proposals and

recommendations, respectively, of the Annual Transfer

Committee and the Annual Transfer Proposals Review

Committee. The said first paragraph of P38 and P39 reads as

follows:

T.

This is ultra vires on the part of the Annual Transfer Committee

and abdication of statutory duty on the part of the 1st

Respondent, to whom alone power has been delegated by the

Public Service Commission.

Learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents states in

the written submission that in issuing P38 and P39, the 1st

Respondent does not act as a rubber stamp, and the Court shall

take a purposive approach, and the word decision found

therein shall be replaced with the word recommendation. I am

not inclined to agree. It cannot be so simple when the

legislature has carefully chosen three separate words proposal,

recommendation and decision to deal with three separate acts.

There are no other items of evidence to suggest the 1st

Respondent took the said decisions independently.

The next submission of learned State Counsel is the Public

Service Commission later approved P38 and P39, and therefore

the constitutional ouster clause contained in Article 61A of the

Constitution becomes operative, ousting the jurisdiction of this

Court to review the decision/approval of the Public Service

Commission.

7

Article 61A reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no

court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question

any order or decision made by the [Public Service]

Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in

pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on

such Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public

officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.

I must emphasise that an ouster clause be it statutory or

constitutional which takes away the rights of a citizen to come

before Court against wrongful administrative decisions shall be

liberally interpreted in order to protect such rights and not deny

them.

Article 61A can be invoked only when a decision has been taken

by the Public Service Commission or by a Committee/Public

Officer to whom the Public Service Commission has delegated its

power. In the facts and circumstances of this case, Article 61A

has no application, as the Petitioners are challenging the

decision taken by a Committee which had no power or duty to

take such a decision. The said decision is ultra vires and

therefore a nullity. A decision which is a nullity cannot be given

validity by ratification by the Public Service Commission or any

other authority for that matter. Simply stated, if the decision is

a nullity, there is nothing to ratify or approve. Hence Article 61A

does not arise for consideration. (Vide Abeywickrema v.

1 Sri LR 120, Chandrasiri v. Attorney General [1989] 1 Sri LR 115,

Gunaratne v. Chandrananda de Silva [1998] 3 Sri LR 265,

Kotakadeniya v. Kodithuwakku [2000] 2 Sri LR 175)

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL ER

1169 at 1172 states:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only

bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the

court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void.

Without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to

have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You

cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

The above passage was referred to with approval by G.P.S. de

Silva J. (later C.J.) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri

Kantha LR 164 at 168-169, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) in

Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands

(1978) 80 NLR 1 at 182, and Sripavan J. (later C.J.) in

Leelawathie v. Commissioner of National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR

175 at 178.

Sharvananda J. in Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of

Agriculture and Lands (supra) at 182 quoted the following

portion of Hailsham (4th Edition) Vol. I, paragraph 27:

9

No legally recognised rights found on the assumption of its

validity should accrue to any person even before the act is

declared to be invalid or set aside in a Court of Law.

This principle was applied by the Supreme Court in the more

recent case of Padmal Ariyasiri Mendis v. Vijith Abraham de Silva

[2016] BLR 69 at 73, where it was held:

The deed No. 1551 is void ab initio and therefore the title

does not pass from the plaintiff to any other person.

Therefore deed which was executed thereafter, i.e. deed No.

976 is also void ab initio.

Wade in Administrative Law (9th Edition) at page 280 states:

Where some act or order is invalid or void, the

consequences are followed out logically: consequential acts

are also invalid.

The final argument of learned State Counsel is the Petitioners

application shall be dismissed on futility.

P38 and P39 are dated 12.11.2018. The Petitioners came before

this Court on 07.12.2018. As at today, out of the six Petitioners,

the transfers of only the 3rd and 4th Petitioners remain active: the

3rd and 4th Petitioners were transferred for a period of three

years, whereas the other Petitioners were transferred for one

year, which has now lapsed. However, futility on this basis shall

not be a ground for dismissal of the application in toto.

In the first place, the rights of the parties shall be decided at the

time of institution of the action.

10

Secondly, this Court does not act in vain by formally quashing

P38 and P39 by certiorari to impress upon the 1st Respondent

how he shall act in future. Other authorities who discharge

functions of a public nature may also take note that the same

fate will befall them if they too behave as the 1st Respondent did

in this instance.

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri LR 46, the Petitioner-

Appellant applied for certiorari and mandamus against the

refusal of a liquor license for the year 1987. When the matter

came before the Supreme Court in 1988, it was only academic

as the year 1987 had passed. Nonetheless, whilst allowing the

appeal, Justice Amarasinghe took the view The court will not be

acting in vain in quashing the determination not to issue the

licence for 1987 because the right of the Petitioner to be fully and

fairly heard in future applications is being recognised.

In Nimalasiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela [2003] 3 Sri LR 85,

Sripavan J. (later C.J.) stated:

Learned State Counsel urged that it is a futile exercise to

issue a writ of certiorari because the decision complained of

related to the year 2002 which had already expired.

However, following the decision in Sudakaran v. Barathi

and others [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 this Court issues a writ of

certiorari quashing the decision of the second Respondent

contained in the letter dated 27.08.2002 marked (P4). Thus

this Court is not acting in vain because the right of the

Petitioner to be fully and fairly heard in future application is

recognized.

11

I quash P38 and P39, insofar as the Petitioners are concerned,

by a writ of certiorari. Accordingly, I grant the reliefs as prayed

for in paragraphs (c) and (e) of the prayer to the petition.

The application is allowed with costs.
