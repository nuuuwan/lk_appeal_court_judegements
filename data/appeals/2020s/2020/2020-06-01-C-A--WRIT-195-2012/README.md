Parties agreed on 02.09.2019 that this matter can be disposed of by written submissions. It was

further agreed that the only issue to be determined by Court is whether sections 12, 44, 57, 59

and 107 of the Customs Ordinance covers other goods stored in the same container with the

contraband.

However, the reference to section 107 of the Customs Ordinance is irrelevant to the issue

raised by the parties as the further forfeiture amounting to treble the value of goods was made

in terms of sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 130 of the Customs Ordinance.

The contraband in issue is 507.15 Kgs. of sandalwood which was attempted to be exported in a

container which inter alia contained other goods. There is no dispute that sandalwood is an

item falling within Schedule B of the Customs Ordinance the importation/export of which is

subject to restrictions and prohibitions. In view of the concessions made at the hearing, it is not

in dispute that there was an attempt to export the contraband in violation of sections 12 and 44

of the Customs Ordinance.

The issue for determination is whether sections 57, 59 and 130 of the Customs Ordinance

provide for the imposition of treble the value of goods including other goods stored in the same

container with the contraband.

Before proceeding to consider these specific provisions, I wish to consider the order made at

the customs inquiry in relation to the forfeiture of the other goods which were stored in the

same container as the contraband.

The relevant portion of the order reads:

i. Forfeiture of 507.15 Kg of sandalwood valued at Rs. 197,789/= in terms of

sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 109 of the Customs Ordinance read with the Import

and Export Control Act No.1 of 1969,

Page 3 of 8

ii. Further forfeiture of Rs. 20,464,000.80 (20.4 million) being treble the value of

the goods in terms of sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 130 of the Customs Ordinance

read with Import and Export Control Act No. 01 of 1969 against the Petitioner,

iii. Forfeiture of 205 cartons of garments valued at Rs. 2,895,099.57 attempted to

be exported by M/s Ayesha Garments, and 223 cartons of garments valued at Rs.

3,224,921.04 attempted to be exported by M/s Jaffersons Garments, in terms of

section 59 and 119 of the Customs Ordinance. These goods were released by the

2nd Respondent upon the imposition and payment of a penalty of Rs. 100,000/=

each payable by M/s Ayesha Garments and M/s Jaffersons Garments,

iv. Initial forfeiture and thereafter release of the rest of the cargo in terms of

sections 59 and 163 ofthe Customs Ordinance.

Section 12 of the Customs Ordinance provides for the prohibition or restriction of the export or

import of certain goods. Section 44 of the Customs Ordinance provides for the forfeiture of

goods that are sought to be exported contrary to the prohibitions and restrictions in section 12

ofthe Customs Ordinance.

In this context, I wish to explain the incident of forfeiture in the Customs Ordinance.

In Palasamy Nadar v. Lanktree (51 N.L.R. 520 at 522) Gratiaen J. stated:

"Section 46 (which is the present Section 44) provides that any goods exported or taken

out of the Island contrary to certain specified prohibitions and restrictions "shall be

farfeited and shall be destroyed or disposed of as the Principal Collector of Customs may

direct." The Customs Ordinance is an antiquated enactment ........... Some of its

provisions declare that in certain circumstances goods "shall be forfeited" while in other

circumstances they are merely "liable to be forfeited" .... I am prepared to concede that

the draftsmen must be given credit for having intended the terms "forfeited" and "liable

to forfeiture" to convey different meanings. If the goods are declared to be "forfeited"

as opposed to "liable to forfeiture" on the happening of a given event, their owner is

automatically and by operation of law divested of his property in the goods as soon as

Page 4 of8

the event occurs. No adjudication declaring the forfeiture to have taken place is

required to implement the automatic incident of forfeiture ...

A forfeiture of goods by operation of law would, of course, be of purely academic

interest until the owner is in fact deprived of his property by some official intervention.

Section 123 (present Section 125) of the Ordinance provides the machinery for this

purpose ... When that is done, the goods "shall be deemed and taken to be condemned"

and may be dealt with in the manner directed by law unless the person from whom they

have been seized or their owner "shall, within one month from the date of seizure ... give

notice in writing to the Collector .... that he intends to enter a claim to the ... goods ...

and shall further give security to prosecute such claim before the Court having

jurisdiction to entertain same." (Section 146) (This is the present Section 154)

This decision which was made in 1949 was followed a good half a century later by the present

Supreme Court in Lanko }othiko Sorvodayo Shramadano Sangamaya v. Heengama Director

General of Customs and Others (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 1 where Kulatunge J. after making a detailed

analysis ofthe Customs Ordinance went on to state that (at page 13):

'The Customs Law applicable to forfeiture and seizure of goods is relevant to a proper

determination of the application before us. Forfeiture of goods is one of the

consequences of a breach of the provisions of the Customs Ordinance. Some of the

sections provide that in the event of such breach the goods shall be forfeited e.g.

Sections 34(1), 43, 44, 50, 50A (l)(b), 52, 55, 65, 75, 100A(2), 107, 107A(1), 107A(2),

121, 131 and 142. Section 57 provides thot in the obsence of any explanation to the

satisfaction of the Director General of Customs, the goods shall be forfeited. Sections

38 and 68 provide that the goods sholl be lioble to forfeiture".

Hence it is seen that the Customs Ordinance provides for the forfeiture of the goods in relation

to which a customs offense takes place. But in certain situations the Customs Ordinance

envisages the forfeiture of other goods as well.

Page 5 of8

Section 57 of the Customs Ordinance requires every exporter to deliver a Bill of Entry, which is

in the modern usage sometimes also referred to as a Customs Declaration or "CusDec",

containing inter alia an accurate specification of the quantity, quality and value of the goods to

be exported and the number, denomination, dimensions and description of the respective

packages containing the goods. If the goods do not agree with the particulars in the bill of

entry, in the absence of any explanation to the satisfaction of the Director-General of Customs,

the same shall be forfeited and such forfeiture includes all other goods which sholl be entered or

packed with them as well as the packages in which they are contained.

In this context, the customs violation results in the forfeiture of the goods concerned as well as

all other goods which shall be entered or packed with them as well as the packages in which

they are contained. The word "entered" in section 57 of the Customs Ordinance in my view

means included in the Bill of Entry or CusDec.

However, section 57 of the Customs Ordinance does not cover the imposition of a forfeiture

amounting to treble the value of goods although it provides for the forfeiture of the goods in

relation to which the violation of section 57 of the Customs Ordinance occurred as well as the

forfeiture of all other goods which were entered or packed with them as well as the packages in

which they were contained. Therefore, the impugned order cannot be sustained in terms of

section 57 of the Customs Ordinance.

In contrast, section 59 of the Customs Ordinance deals with both the forfeiture of goods

together with the means of conveyance and the imposition of treble the value of goods. The

question is what is meant by "such goods" in relation to the imposition of treble the value of

the goods.

In my view the drafters of the Customs Ordinance appear to have made a clear distinction

between situations where they intended to encompass only the goods in relation to which a

customs violation occurred compared to situations where all other goods entered or packed

with them as well as the packages in which they were contained are brought into the equation.

That to me appears to be the reason for section 57 of the Customs Ordinance to specifically

refer to goods entered or packed with the goods in relation to which a customs violation

Page 6 of 8

occurred whereas section 59 only refers to "such goods". Therefore, in my view section 59 of

the Customs Ordinance does not allow the imposition of treble the value of goods in the instant

matter to include all other goods entered or packed with the sandalwood.

Section 130 of the Customs Ordinance provides for the imposition of a forfeiture of, either one

hundred thousand or treble the value of goods at the election of the Director-General of

Customs. The subject matter of this section is goods which are prohibited or restricted for

export.

The question is what is caught up within the words "value of the goods" in this section. Here

again, for the same reasons set out above in relation to section 59 of the Customs Ordinance, I

am of the view that it means only the goods in relation to which a customs violation took place

and not to goods entered or packed with the goods in relation to which a customs violation

occurred.

Therefore, that part of the order made by the 2nd Respondent imposing a forfeiture of Rs.

20,464,000.80 (20.4 million] being treble the value of the goods, which included the contraband

as well as the other goods entered or packed with it, in terms of sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 130

of the Customs Ordinance read with Import and Export Control Act No. 01 of 1969 against the

Petitioner is ultra vires.

However, I hasten to add that the rest of the order was not assailed in these proceedings.

Further that part of the order by which a forfeiture of treble the value of the contraband

sandalwood is valid.

In Ranatunge v. Cammissianer-General of Agrarian Development and Another rCA (Writ]

180/2017, CAM. 17.07.2019) I have, after examining the position in English law, held that

partial quashing of a decision is possible provided the valid part can be severed from the

invalid.

r ,

In this case, the 2nd Respondent acted ultra vires by imposing a forfeiture of Rs. 20,464,000.80

(20.4 million) being treble the value of the goods, which included the contraband as well as the

other goods entered or packed with it, in terms of sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 130 of the

Customs Ordinance read with Import and Export Control Act No. 01 of 1969 against the

Petitioner.

I issue a writ of certiorari quashing that part of the order P-13. For the avoidance of doubt, the

order made by the 2nd Respondent should now read as imposing a forfeiture of Rs. 593,367/=

(197,789/= X 3) being treble the value of the goods in terms of sections 12, 44, 57, 59 and 130

of the Customs Ordinance read with Import and Export Control Act No. 01 of 1969 against the

Petitioner.

The application is partially allowed. Parties shall bear their costs.
