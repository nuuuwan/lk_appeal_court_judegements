ACHALA WEN GAP PUll, J.

In this application, the Petitioner primarily seeks to quash an

indictment pending before the Permanent High Court at Bar in case No.

PTBj01j05j2019 by issuance of a Writ of Certiorari and stay the said

prosecution by issuance of a Writ of Prohibition.

Upon the application of the Petitioner by motion dated 24.07.2019, a

Divisional Bench was constituted to hear and determine this application,

owing to the "crucial and critical legal questions which embraces the rare

combination of the core of both Criminal law and Public law" it involves.

The Petitioner has served notice on the Respondents as per Rule 2(1)

of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 and the 1st to 7th

and 14th Respondents were represented at the hearing for issuance of

formal notice and interim relief.

The Petitioner, after his graduation from the University of

Nottingham in 2008, was involved in the filed of Stock-brokering and

Investment Banking and had served in several commercial establishments.

He acted as an Independent Non-Executive Director of Perpetual

Treasuries Ltd., of its Board of Directors, upon invitation by the 9th

Respondent, over their long acquaintance.

The Petitioner categorically denies his participation of any meeting

of the board of Directors of the said Company, either formally or

informally, during February 2015. He attended his first meeting only in 5

March 2015 and therefore claims that the concerned incident in relation to

the charges in the indictment occurred on or about 27.02.2015, and by that

date had not even attended a single Board Meeting of the said Company.

He became aware in March 2019 that he was named a suspect in the

Magistrate's Court of Colombo in case No. B 8266/2018 by the Financial

Investigations Unit III of the Criminal Investigation Department and was

subsequently named as the 10th accused in case No. PTB 1/5/2019,

pending before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

The complaint of the Petitioner to this Court is the decision of the 6th

Respondent to initiate criminal proceedings against him before the

Permanent High Court at Bar, is taken arbitrarily, capriciously

unreasonably, irrationally and in haste, without giving due considerations

to the factors stipulated in Section 12A(4)(a)(i) to (v) of the Judicature Act

(as amended by Act No.9 of 2018) in referring the matter to His Lordship

the Chief Justice for a direction, whether criminal proceedings in respect of

such offence shall be instituted in the Permanent High Court at Bar,

rendering the act illegal and unlawful, thus a nullity and no avail in law.

At the hearing, the parties made extensive submissions in support of

their respective positions and were afforded an opportunity to tender a

precis of their respective submissions and the authorities they relied on.

The Petitioner has sought the following substantive reliefs from this

Court by invocation of its jurisdiction conferred under Article 140 of the

6

Constitution, (in addition to the multiple reliefs that associate with these

substantial reliefs, in the interim);

a. Issuance of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the charges against the

Petitioner contained in the impugned indictment or in the

alternative, quashing the impugned indictment,

b. Issuance of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 6th

Respondent to initiate criminal proceedings against andj or indict

the Petitioner for the charges contained in the said indictment,

c. Issuance of a Writ of Prohibition preventing and or restraining

the 6th Respondent from proceeding against the Petitioner for the

charges contained in the said indictment,

d. Issuance of a Writ of Prohibition preventing and or restraining

the 7th Respondent from listing, commencing and continuing any

proceedings against the Petitioner before the "Permanent High

Court at Bar" pertaining to the charges stipulated in the said

indictment,

e. Issuance of a Writ of Prohibition preventing and or restraining

the 5th and 6th Respondents from directly or indirectly through

INTERPOL in any manner or against the Petitioner and seek

extradition against him based on the said indictment,

It is clear from the nature of the reliefs sought from this Court, that

the main thrust of the Petitioner's challenge is focused on the validity of

the indictment pending against him before the Permanent High Court at

Bar in case No. PTBjOlj05j2019. He alleges that the decision to indict him

is "... arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, vexations, and irrational" and

7

therefore is "clearly an abuse a/process", since it had been taken "depriving"

him of procedural fairness and in violation of his legitimate expectations.

In mounting his challenge on the validity of the indictment, the

Petitioner, in his submissions before this Court, had placed heavy reliance

on the provisions of Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978,

as amended by Act No.9 of 2018,

Learned President's Counsel contended before this Court that the

decision taken by the 6th Respondent to indict the Petitioner before the

Permanent High Court at Bar should be quashed since;

a. he was deprived of an opportunity to make a statement, in view

of the order of the Magistrate's Court of Colombo on 05.04.2019

in case No. B 8266/18, by which the Court ordered him to

"appear at the Criminal Investigation Department on or before

26.06.2019". Instead, the Criminal Investigation Department (

hereinafter referred to as "CID") had filed a report on 13.06.2019,

under Section 120(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979, informing Court that the investigations were

concluded, when in fact the investigations were,incompleted due

to their failure to record the Petitioner's statement, in violation of

the mandatory provisions couched in the said Section,

b. the 6th Respondent had sought a direction from His Lordship the

Chief Justice by making a request on 07.06.2019, that criminal

8

proceeding be instituted before the Permanent High Court at Bar

and, upon the receipt of a direction issued by His Lordship to

that effect, an indictment was forwarded to the Permanent High

Court at Bar on 28.06.2019, naming the Petitioner as the 10th

accused. Therefore, the decisions of the 6th Respondent to indict

the Petitioner, and to seek a direction from His Lordship the

Chief Justice which are taken under Section 12A(4)(a) of the

Judicature Act, even before the investigations are properly

completed, are taken in a "dubious haste" and therefore results in

a nullity, due to following factors;

firstly, the 6th Respondent's decision to indict him should

be based on the fulfilment of provisions of the Judicature

(Amendment) Act, and;

secondly, in the absence of a statement of the Petitioner

and without having an opportunity appraising himself of

its contents, the 6th Respondent could not have formed his

opinion as to the existence of the "five" mandatory

"fetters" that are specified in the said Section.

The 14th Respondent, also contended that the actions of the CID are

violative of the mandatory provisions of Section 120(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and resulted in a denial of a fair

investigation.

9

Thus, it is clear from these contentions, the Petitioner challenges the

validity of the decisions taken by the 6th Respondent to institute

proceedings against him and to indict him before the Permanent High

Court at Bar.

In view of the submissions of the Petitioner, it is necessary to

examine the scheme of statutory provisions introduced by Section

12A(4)(a) to the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 by way of Judicature

(Amendment) Act No.9 of 2018.

The said Section reads as follows;

"The A ttorney General or, the Director General for the

Prevention of Bribery and Corruption on the direction of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption, as the case may be, shall, taking into

consideration-

(i) the nature and circumstances;

(ii) the gravity;

(iii) the complexity;

(iv) the impact on the victim; or

(v) the impact on the State,

of the offence, referred to In subsection (1), refer the

information relating to the commission of such offence to the

Chief Justice for a dzrection whether criminal proceedings in

respect of such offence shall be instituted in the Permanent

High Court at Bar. "

10

The provisions of Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act, as

amended by Act No.9 of 2018, is only a part of the new statutory scheme

the Parliament had enacted when it introduced several new Sections with

the passing of the Act No. 09 of 2018 and by insertion of Sections 12A, 12B

and 12C immediately after the Section 12 of the principle enactment .

Amendments to the JudicatUre Act, that were brought in by Act No.

9 of 2018, have created a special Court and conferred it with jurisdiction to

exercise original criminal jurisdiction only in respect of a set of statutorily

specified offences.

reads;

Section 12A(1)(a) of the Judicature Act, after the said amendment

"Notwithstanding anything in any other written law, the

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

for a Province shall, in terms of sub-paragraph (c) of

paragraph (3) of Article 154P of the Constitution hear, try

and determine in the manner provided for by written law

and subject to the provisions of subsection (4), prosecutions

on indictment against any person, in respect of financial and

economic offences specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Act,

and any other offence committed in the course of the same

transaction of any such offence, with three Judges sitting

together nominated by the Chief Justice from among the

Judges of the High Court oj the Republic of Sri Lanka

11

(hereinafter referred to as the "Permanent High Court at

Thus, it is evident from the statutory provisions contained in Section

12A(1)(a), that it confers jurisdiction to the newly established Permanent

High Court at Bar to hear, try and determine "prosecutions on indictment

against any person, in respect of financial and economic offences specified in the

Sixth Schedule to this Act, and any other offence committed in the course of the

same transaction of any such offence". But Section 12A(4)(b) imposes a

precondition for institution of proceedings in this manner as the said

Section states that the institution of proceedings should only be done upon

a direction to that effect by His Lordship the Chief Justice.

It is to be noted that these provisions are similarly applicable to the

Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption, who could

institute criminal proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar, on

the direction of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption as well. Section 24(1) of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994, had invested the

Supreme Court with the jurisdiction conferred upon this Court under

Article 140 of the Constitution in respect of the said Commission and

therefore the prosecutions instituted by the said Commission are outside

the preview of this Court. Hence, this judgment will only concern the

prosecutions that are instituted by the 6th Respondent, the Attorney

General.

12

Section 12A(4)(a) specified the applicable procedure in instituting

criminal proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar. The 6th

Respondent could "refer the information relating to the commission of such

offence to the Chief Justice for a direction whether criminal proceedings in respect

of such offence shall be instituted in the Permanent High Court at Bar". Only

after taking certain factors in to consideration that are statutorily

enumerated in the said Section. If there is a direction to that effect from

His Lordship the Chief Justice, then a trial before the Permanent High

Court at Bar, "shall be held upon indictment by the Attorney General ... ".

The Petitioner, in his submissions stressed the point that, in order to

seek a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice, the 6th Respondent

should have first satisfied himself that" all" of the "five fetters", as termed

by the Petitioner, that are specified in Section 12A(4) (a), exists.

The Petitioner is wrong in identifying these are "five fetters" in the

Section. Section 12A(4)(a) stipulates that the 6th Respondent to take into

consideration what it had specified in the Section. The Section lists out the

following, under the scheme of numbering given to them as (i) to (v);

"(i) the nature and circumstances;

(ii) the gravity;

(iii) the complexity;

(iv) the impact on the victim; or,

(v) the impact on the State."

13

It is clear from the above, what the 6th Respondent is required to

consider under "impact". He must consider either the impact on the

victim "or" the impact on the State and not both. The Petitioner, in the

context of exercising discretion, sought to describe them as "fetters". In

that limited context, it is a justifiable description. As a result there are

only four "fetters" to be considered by the 6th Respondent in making a

request. The Section requires the 6th Respondent to seek a direction from

His Lordship the Chief Justice only after taking into consideration of

these four "fetters". The 6th Respondent would therefore have to consider

the available material in relation to each of these four factors, before he

exercises his discretion to refer the matter for a direction.

It appears that the Petitioner is under a misapprehension that the

institution of proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar

essentially consists of a "two staged process". According to him the first of

the two stages occurs when the 6th Respondent considers the "fetters" in

determining the Court where he should file the indictment. The second

stage, as the Petitioner described, is the stage at which the direction of His

Lordship the Chief Justice is addressed to the 6th Respondent to institute

proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar, if His Lordship is

satisfied that one or more of the" fetters" did exist.

The Petitioner contends that, the discretion is vested in His

Lordship the Chief Justice to grant the request of the 6th Respondent for a

direction, in relation to the institution of proceedings before the Permanent

High Court at Bar, should necessarily be exercised by His Lordship, upon

14

consideration of the material submitted to him along with the said request

by the 6th Respondent. If the material considered by the 6th Respondent,

when he exercised his discretion, deciding to institute criminal

proceedings against the Petitioner and, in seeking a direction from His

Lordship the Chief Justice, is incomplete, then that initial disqualification

of the decisions of the 6th Respondent is transmitted to the exercise of the

discretion by His Lordship the Chief Justice as well. Therefore, he argues

that the institution of proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar

is a nullity due to the reason that" .. . if the prosecuting authority ... doesn't

fulfill the first stage of the process lawfully, properly and appropriately, then that

gravely, and inevitably affects the second stage, as the second stage of the process

derives from and is completely reliant and dependent on the first stage of the

process."

This Court agrees with the Petitioner that Section 12A(4)

contemplates two stages as he had described them. However, in his

description of the two stage process, the Petitioner unfortunately ignores

an equally important step in the process. That is the decision of the

prosecuting authority to present an indictment. The decision to indict is

obviously the starting point of the process, since the Court in which the

proceedings should be instituted would only arise as a secondary

consideration with the decision to indict. It appears that the Petitioner

sought to fuse the two distinct decision making processes, in which the 6th

Respondent decides to indict and then decides whether to seek a direction

from His Lordship the Chief Justice, by arranging them along a straight

line of decision making process. The decision of the 6th Respondent to

15

present an indictment is taken when the available material is sufficient to

establish a prima facie case against the suspect. Then only, the 6th

Respondent must decide the Court in which he should institute

proceedings. These two distinct decision making processes, independent

of each other, involve application of two different considerations.

In deciding the Court in which the institution of criminal

proceedings be instituted, the 6th Respondent had several options. He

could direct the police to institute criminal proceedings before the

Magistrate's Court. He could also decide to forward an indictment to the

High Court of the Republic. Under section 450 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, the 6th Respondent could also request His

Lordship the Chief Justice to direct that the trial of any person for that

offence taken before the High Court at Bar. With the establishment of the

Permanent High Court at Bar, the 6th Respondent is offered with another

option in seeking a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice. Thus, it

is clear that the decision making process to seek a direction from His

Lordship the Chief Justice under Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act is

a distinct process from deciding to indict since the 6th Respondent must

consider the four "fetters" in doing so, in fulfilment of his statutorily laid

down obligation.

Clearly the decision to indict is obviously the starting point of the

process, since the Court in which the proceedings should be instituted

would arise only with the decision to indict. Contrary to the submissions

of the Petitioner, the amendment brought to the Judicature Act, although

16

correctly termed substantive law and not procedural law by the Petitioner,

does not empower the prosecuting authority with power to indict.

Learned Additional Solicitor General referred to a statutory

provision which he claims that the 6th Respondent could utilise to institute

criminal proceedings. He submitted that the 6th Respondent was

empowered to institute proceedings under Section 24 of the Commissions

of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948, as amended by Act No. 16 of 2008. The Said

Section conferred the power to the Attorney General to institute

proceedings as it states" ... it shall be lawful for the Attorney General to

institute criminal proceedings in a Court of law in respect of any offence, based on

material collected in the course of an investigation and or inquiry or both an

investigation and inquiry, ... , by a Commission of Inquiry appointed under this

Act."

Plain reading of this section indicates that it empowers the 6th

Respondent to institute criminal proceedings based "on material collected in

the course of an investigation and or inquiry or both an investigation and inquiry,

... " by a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the said Act, in order to

override the mandatory provision contained in Section 5 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. The said Section of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act imposes a mandatory duty that all offences, unless

otherwise specially provided for, shall be investigated, inquired into, tried

and otherwise be dealt with the provisions of that Code. It also imposes

the condition that the investigations should be conducted either by the

police or by an "inquirer" recognised by the Code. With this amendment

17

I

to the Commissions of Inquiry Act, the 6th Respondent could consider

"material collected in the course of an investigation and or inquiry or both an

investigation and inquiry" by that Commission.

The intention of the Legislature in this regard is clearly reflected in

the wording found in the Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act as

it is states that "notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 or any other law, it shall be lawful for the

Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings in a court of law in respect of

,;r" " any oJJc nce, ... .

Section 393(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979,

states" it shall be lawful for the Attorney General to exhibit information, present

indictments and to institute, undertake, or carryon criminal proceedings ... " and

section 12 of the said Act states" High Court shall not take cognizance of any

offence unless the accused person has been indicted before it for trial or at the

instance of the A ttorney General".

No such parallel provisions, similar to the provisions that are found

in Section 393(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, that confer the 6th

Respondent with power to institute proceedings, could be found in Section

12A of the Judicature Act or in Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry

Act. This Court is of the view that the power conferred by Section 12A of

the Judicature Act only empowers the 6th Respondent to consider the

material before him in determining the Court before he wishes to institute

criminal proceedings.

18

The resultant position therefore could be described as necessarily a

three stage process, not a two stage process as the Petitioner contends. In

addition to the two stage process, identified by the Petitioner there is an

initial and a more fundamental step by which the 6th Respondent decides

to institute proceedings, which triggers the remaining two stages.

In order to fill this gap in the contention advanced by the Petitioner,

in relation to 6th Respondent's power to indict, he relies on the

observations made by the Supreme Court in its determination of the

Constitutionality of the draft bill of the Judicature (Amendment) Act No.9

of 2018 (SC/SD/07/2018 - SC/SD/13/2018). The Petitioner, in order to

buttress his contention that Section 12A(4)(a) confers power to 6th

Respondent to indict as well as to seek a direction, whether he could

forwards an indictment or exhibit information to the Permanent High

Court at Bar, has highlighted the fact that the Supreme Court has foreseen

a remote possibility of abuse of discretion, if the provision remained

unchanged as it was proposed in the draft bill, and had therefore

addressed its mind in remedying the situation by stating that;

"In the draft bill, the prosecution has a discretion to select

cases and file indictment in the Permanent High Court at

Bar. The danger is that there is a possibility of wrongly

exercising of the discretion although it may not happen.

Therefore, like in section 450 of the Criminal Procedure

Code, Chief Justice should be given power to decide whether

a trial at bar should be held or not. This will remove

inconsistency in the Bill."

19

In view of the said recommendation by the Supreme Court, the

Petitioner contends that;

"The Supreme Court rightfully acknowledged that vesting

the discretionary power to indict before the Trial at Bar with

the Attorney General who is the prosecuting authority, as "it

might lead to abuse of process". Following the Supreme

Court's determination, and in adopting the suggestion of the

Court, the Legislature in the Judicature (Amendment) Act

No. 9 of 2018, while imposing five mandatory fettering

factors to be considered by the prosecuting authority, which

would following such considerations of the five mandatory

fettering factors forward such information to His Lordship

the Chief Justice, who is empowered by the Act to decide on

the said information submitted to his Lordship by the

prosecuting authority, whether to indict before the

Permanent High Court at Bar."

It is evident that the Petitioner, with his submissions referred to

above, seeks to confer statutory power on the 6th Respondent to indict

under the section 12A of the Judicature Act.

Clearly this is not an accurate statement of the law, in view of the

explicit statutory provisions referred to in the preceding paragraphs. In the

determination referred to above, the Supreme Court had expressed its

concern on the possibility of abuse, only in respect of leaving the decision

to institute proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar with the

6th Respondent. The recommendation was to remove the proposed power

20

conferred on the 6th Respondent, which enabled him to decide the Court,

in which he should present an indictment. Its observation on "wrongly

exercising the discretion" is clearly confined to that particular provision and

not on the general power of the 6th Respondent to institute proceedings by

presenting an indictment.

This Court is of the considered view that, without challenging the 6th

Respondent's exercise of discretion to indict the Petitioner directly, and by

confining his challenge only to the exercise of the discretion conferred

upon the 6th Respondent to refer the matter for a direction to His Lordship

the Chief Justice under Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act by

erroneously attributing the power to indict also to the said section, it is not

possible for the Petitioner to obtain reliefs he had prayed for in his

petition.

The decision to indict had been made by the 6th Respondent, prior to

making a request for direction under Section 12A(4)(a). That decision

remained unchallenged. The Petitioner did not challenge the exercise of

discretion of His Lordship the Chief Justice, in directing the 6th Respondent

to institute proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar, either. It

is already not~d that His Lordship is expected to consider at least one of

the factors, spelt out in Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act in directing

the 6th Respondent to institute proceedings before the Permanent High

Court at Bar.

21

The pending indictment against the Petitioner carne into being

because the 6th Respondent had decided there is a prima facie case

established upon consideration of the relevant material. The 6th

Respondent could have simply forwarded an indictment to the High Court

of Colombo, as he would do in most of the cases, where that Court is

bound to take cognizance of such indictments. Instead, owing to the

circumstances of the material revealed and having considered the four

"fetters" in section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act, the 6th Respondent had

sought a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice to institute

proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

The decision of the 6th Respondent to institute proceedings by way

of an indictment against the ten accused, including the Petitioner, would

still remain valid since the Petitioner thought it fit not to challenge the

discretion of the 6th Respondent to indict him and the institution of

proceedings before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

Therefore, even if this Court were to hold with the Petitioner that the

discretion of the 6th Respondent, in seeking a direction from His Lordship

the Chief justice, is wrongly exercised, in the absence of a valid challenge

to the other two steps such a decision taken by the 6th Respondent it

would not invalidate the criminal proceedings that are pending before the

Permanent High Court at Bar. The nature of the error, (there is none) had

crept in only at the second stage of the process, which would not transmit

itself either to the first or the third stages of the three stage process.

22

It is relevant to mention here that the Petitioner is not challenging

the indictment on the footing that given the material available before the

6th Respondent, he could not have reasonably forwarded an indictment.

He sought to challenge it on the basis of discretion conferred under section

12A(4)(a) was wrongly exercised to indict him, which is clearly an instance

of the Petitioner misleading himself. The wrong complained of by the

Petitioner, in challenging the 6th Respondent, in his decision to make a

request for a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice did not affect

the decision to indict, which was taken independently of the latter. In fact,

there was no decision to indict, interwoven with the decision to make the

request since the applicable considerations are quite different to each other

on these two instances.

Therefore, by nullifying the request to His Lordship the Chief Justice

by the 6th Respondent for a direction, the decision to indict or the pending

indictment will not automatically vitiate by themselves. Even though the

Petitioner seeks Writ of Certiorari against the decision to indict and on the

indictment itself, he only challenged the decision to make a request for a

direction, on a presumed wrong, which had no bearing on the decision to

indict or on the charges.

The consideration of exercise of the discretion by the 6th Respondent

to indict brings in another important area for this Court to consider since

the learned Additional Solicitor General claimed in his submissions that

the decision of the 6th Respondent in determining whether to present

23

charges against an accused or not is not amenable to the jurisdiction of this

Court, conferred under Article 140 of the Constitution.

In countering this claim, the Petitioner relies on the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Victor Ivan v Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General &

Another (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 340. This was an instance where the Petitioner

challenged the decision of the Attorney General to indict him in respect of

several defamatory articles he had published in the Ravaya newspaper,

claiming it violated his fundamental rights. Fernando ], having considered

the contention advanced by the Respondent that the Attorney General's

decision to grant sanction to prosecute, or to file an indictment, or the

refusal to do so are absolute, unfettered and unreviewabl", proceed to

reject the same by stating that " ... the Attorney General's power to file (or not

to file) an indictment ... is a discretionary power, which is neither absolute nor

unfettered. It is similar to other powers vested by law in public functionaries. They

are held in trust for the public, to be exercised for the purpose for which they have

been conferred, and not otherwise."

His Lordship was pleased to term the decision, taken by the

Attorney General to institute criminal proceedings, simply as an "executive

or administrative action". It is stated in the judgment that;

"It is clear that the Attorney-General has a statutory

discretion, which involves several aspects. He has to decide

whether to give or refuse sanction; and whether to exclude a

summary trial, and, in that event, whether to order non-

summary proceedings or to file an indictment. The exercise

24

'rr====================================9

of that discretion is neither legislative nor judicial action, but

constitutes "executive or administrative action" ".

In a comparatively more recent judgment of the Supreme Court

(Sarath de Abrew v Iddamalgoda and six Others (S.C.F/R No. 424/2015 -

decided on 11.01.2016), where the Petitioner claimed that the decision

taken by the Attorney General to indict him under Section 365B of the

Penal Code as well as to direct the Police to institute proceedings before

the Magistrate's Court had thereby violated his fundamental rights.

The apex Court was of the view that;

"The Attorney General's decision to indict the Petitioner

may be vitiated if a conclusion is arrived not on an

assessment of objective facts or evidence but on subjective

satisfaction. The reason is where the decision is based on

subjective satisfaction if some of the statements turn out to

be irrelevant, it would be impossible for a Superior Court to

find out which of the statements are relevant, valid or invalid

had brought about such satisfaction. But in a case where a

conclusion is based on a collective assessment such difficulty

would not arise. If it is found that there was evidence before

the A ttorney General and such evidence had been considered

by several officers of the said Departmen t and a final decision

was reached by the Attorney General based on the views of

the said officers, the Superior Court would not interfere and

would hesitate to substitute its own view in place of the

A ttorney General. "

25

In applying the rationale of the said judgments of the Supreme

Court, this Court must be mindful that those applications were decided in

relation to Article 126 of the Constitution. Fernando J stated that the Court

had exercised "Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 126, which takes

precedence over the statutory jurisdiction of the High Court". The jurisdiction

conferred in the Supreme Court by Article 126 is an exclusive original

jurisdiction in nature, which is only subject to the other Articles of the

Constitution. In contrast, the Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction on this

Court by Article 140 in the instant application where the jurisdiction of this

Court has been defined as grant and issue, orders in the nature of Writs of

Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo, Mandamus and Quo warranto only

"according to law", thereby subjecting its jurisdiction to both Constitutional

and other general Statutory provisions.

In this context, it is relevant to note that overlapping nature of the

scope of Writ jurisdiction and of the fundamental rights jurisdiction was

considered by the apex Court. The judgment of Mundy v Central

Environmental Authority and Others (S.c. Appeal 58/2003 - decided on

20.01.2004) deals extensively with this aspect and it is therefore necessary

to quote the relevant paragraphs from the judgment, almost in its entirety,

in order to retain its integrity. The relevant determinations are as follows;

"Before dealing with the Court of Appeal judgment, it is

necessary to consider the scope of the writ jurisdiction - the

basis and the grounds on which executive acts and decisions

may be reviewed, as well as the Court's power and discretion

26

in regard to relief - in the light of several Constitutional

provisions. Historically the writ jurisdiction had limitations,

arising from its linkage to the English "prerogative" writs in

regard to which it has been observed:

" ... the development of administrative law remedies

In the common law sphere proceeded piecemeal from a

variety of historical antecedents and, unto well into the

[twentieth] century, without any recognition of the character

and needs of administrative justice as a separate legal

discipline. In fact, the main traditional remedies are classed

as 'extraordinary remedies ' ... " (Friedmann, Law in a

Changing Society, 1959, p 403)

The jurisdiction conferred by Article 140, however, is not

confined to "prerogative" writs, or "extraordinary

remedies", but extends - "subject to the provisions of the

Constitution" - to "orders in the nature of' writs of

Certiorari, etc. Taken in the context of our Constitutional

principles and provisions, these "orders" constitute one of

the principal safeguards against excess and abuse of

executive power: mandating the judiciary to defend the

Sovereignty of the People enshrined in Article 3 against

infringement or encroachment by the Executive, with no

trace of any deference due to the Crown and its agents.

Further, this Court itselfhas long recognized and applied the

"public trust" doctrine: that powers vested in public

authorities are not absolute or unfettered but are held in

trust for the public, to be exercised for the purposes for which

27

they have been conferred, and that their exercise is subject to

judicial review by reference to those purposes .~'

Their Lordships have added that;

"The link between the writ jurisdiction and fundamental

rights is also apparent from Article 126(3), which

contemplates that evidence of an infringement of

fundamental rights may properly arise in the course of

hearing a writ application, whereupon such application must

be referred to this Court which may grant such relief or make

such directions as it may deem just and equitable. Thus,

although this Court would still be exercising the writ

jurisdiction, its powers of review and relief would not be

confined to the old "prerogative" writs. These Constitutional

principles and provlszons have shrunk the area of

administrative discretion and immunity, and have

correspondingly expanded the nature and scope of the public

duties amenable to Mandamus and the categories of

wrongful acts and decisions subject to Certiorari and

Prohibition, as well as the scope of judicial review and

relief"

Thus, when this Court ventures to consider the Petitioner's alleged

grievance, it must bear in mind that the exercise of the jurisdiction under

Article 140 must be undertaken and considered in the light of the rights

conferred on the citizenry by the Constitution. P.P. Craig (Administrative

Law, 5th Ed, p.19), who describes this approach as the "rights based

approach" as he notes" ... that the Courts should whenever possible interpret

28

legislation and the exercise of administrative discretion to be in conformity with

fundamental rights".

It is strange that neither party cited or relied on any local authority

which has considered the extent of a challenge to the prosecutorial powers

of the 6th Respondent could be brought although they quoted extensively

from the judgments of the English and Indian Courts and authoritative

texts on Administrative law, in support of their respective submissions.

In the absence of any citation of any judicial precedent specifically

where the scope of the Writ jurisdiction was considered vis-a-vis the

exercise of the discretion of the Attorney General in the institution of

criminal proceedings, this Court must therefore look for applicable judicial

precedents.

The parties have relied heavily on the English judgments where

certain pronouncements were made by the House of Lords on some of the

issues that had been raised and argued before this Court.

However, it is prudent and important to undertake an exercise in

examining as to how our Courts have dealt with this contentious issue

over the years before this Court considers these authorities.

The judgment of The King v Fernando 8 NLR 354, dealt with an

appeal where it was contended on behalf of the accused that the Attorney

29

General has wrongly exercised his discretion in committing the appellant

to be tried by the District Court. Layard CJ was of the view;

"If the Attorney-General had manifestly abused the

discretion left him under section 387 I have no doubt this

Court could interfere in appeal, as suggested by the

appellants' counsel. I think, however, in this case there is no

reason to think that the A ttorney-General has not exercised a

wise discretion."

The King v Noordeen 13 NLR 115, is an instance where the

revisionary jurisdiction of the then Supreme Court was invoked to

interfere with the refusal by the Attorney General to grant sanction upon

an acquittal. In an appeal from a conviction where the judgment of The

King v Baba Singho 21 NLR 142 has dealt with the discretion of the

Attorney General to decide to which Court he should commit cases. A

Trial at Bar had considered the power of the Attorney General to exhibit

information and the circumstances under which it could be done in the

judgment of The Queen v Gunawardene 56 NLR 193. In Attorney General v

Sivapragasam 60 NLR 468, the then Supreme Court had dealt with the

right of the Attorney General to take over a prosecution and inform the

trial Court that he is not placing any evidence. In the judgment of The

Queen v Liyanage & Others 65 NLR 337, the Trial at Bar held that;

"The second plea is that the Attorney-General should have

satisfied this Court that he had gopd reason for proceeding by

way of information instead of by indictment. The answer to

this is that Section 440A (6) empowers the Attorney-General

30

to exhibi t Information in respect of the offences now charged

against these defendants, and the section contains no

conditions as to how the Attorney-General should exercise

his discretion. Nor do we think we have the power to

question the exercise of the Attorney-General's discretion in

this matter."

The Privy Council, by its judgment of Liyanage & Others v The

Queen 68 NLR 265 has set aside the conviction entered by the Trial at Bar,

in an appeal on the basis that the law under which the appellants were

tried and convicted was ultra vires. At the hearing of that appeal what had

been decided by the Trial at Bar on the powers of the Attorney General to

exhibit information was not challenged. However, it could be seen from

the above quoted portion of the judgment of the Trial at Bar, of the judicial

attitude that prevailed at that point of time when a challenge to the power

to institute criminal proceedings by the Attorney General was made.

The judgment of the Trial at Bar in The Queen v Abeysinghe &

Another 68 NLR 386 is an instance where the power of the Attorney

General to withdraw a conditional pardon granted to an accomplice was

dealt with. In Velu v Velu & Another 76 NLR 21, Weeramantry J sitting

alone had considered the powers of the Attorney General in directing the

Magistrate's Court to commit an accused who had been discharged after

the preliminary inquiry.

In Wijesiri v Attorney General (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 317, the Petitioner

successfully challenged the validity of an indictment presented by the

31

Attorney General without following proper procedure and the jurisdiction

of the High Court to take cognizance of such an indictment, which resulted

in the retrospective amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,

introduced by Act No. 52 of 1980, empowering the Attorney General to

present indictments directly to the High Court, without a preliminary

inquiry, by insertion of a newly created sub Section 7 to Section 393 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

This Court had considered the right of the Attorney General to

defend public officers both in civil and criminal cases by its judgment of

Seetha v Sharvananda and Others (1989) 1 Sri L.R. 94. This was an

application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and the objection raised by the

Petitioner was on the decision to undertake the defence of the Respondent

officers by the Attorney General.

These representative citations clearly reveal the position that the

exercise of discretion of the Attorney General in relation to institution of

proceedings and other related decisions in the administration of criminal

justice could successfully and effectively be challenged under the

regularly and popularly exercised appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

of the appellate Courts.

However, it must be noted that there is an area which had been

identified by the Supreme Court, where these traditional powers of

appeal and revision might not be effective to secure relief to an aggrieved

person.

32

In Victor Ivan v Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General & Another

(supra), the Supreme Court noted that "upon filing of an indictment it is the

High Court alone which has the jurisdiction to try the accused on that

indictment; it has also the power to consider whether that indictment complies

with legal requirements, as to form and etc., but it has no authority whatsoever to

review the antecedent process leading up to the executive act of issuing the

indictment, ... ". (emphasis added)

The precedents thus far considered by this Court did not address

directly on this particular niche of "antecedent process leading up to the

executive act of issuing indictment" in the process of decision making in the

exercise of discretion of the Attorney General to institute criminal

proceedings. This is an area where the jurisdiction conferred under

Article 140 of the Constitution could provide an effective remedy for an

aggrieved party, whose rights were violated.

The nature and the extent of the judicial review of the discretion of

the 6th Respondent over institution of criminal proceedings should be

considered by this Court at this juncture.

Professor Wade in his book (Administrative Law, 10th Ed, p.29),

noted that "unfettered discretion cannot exist where the rule of law reigns. The

same truth can be expressed by saying that all power is capable of abuse and that

the power to prevent abuse is the acid test of effective judicial review". One might

infer from this strong statement that the Courts, in its legitimate task of

exercising of judicial review, have assumed unfettered power upon itself

33

without recognising any limitations in such an undertaking. However, he

also notes (at p. 290 and 297) that" ... there should in principle be no such

thing as unreviewable administrative discretion, which should be just as much a

contradiction in terms as unfettered discretion. The question to be asked is the

scope of judicial review, and in a few special cases the scope for the review of

discretionary decisions may be minimal."

One such area he identifies as where minimal review of the

discretionary powers are the decisions taken in national security. He

quotes Lord Scarman "there is no abdication of judicial function, but there is a

common sense limitation recognised by the judges as to what is Justifiable."

Similarly, under the title "Boundaries of Judicial Review", Prof

Wade observes (at p. 535) that;

'The Court has granted review of a decision to prosecute, or

not to prosecute or to continue or discontinue a prosecution,

but not of a law officer'S refusal to cite a newspaper for

contempt of Court. House of Lords has however held that

decisions about prosecutions are not amenable to judicial

review where the complaint could equally well be made in the

Courts of trial, since otherwise trial would be unacceptably

delayed by collateral proceedings."

It is therefore clear that the English Courts, although recognising its

role in exercising judicial review over the prosecutorial discretion to

prevent any abuse by the prosecuting authorities, are equally mindful of its

impact on the criminal justice system, and clearly indicated its "extreme

34

reluctance" (Sharma v DepitlJ Director of Public Prosecutions & Others

[2006] UKPC 57) for intervention by placing certain limitations in the scope

of judicial review.

The reasons for such "extreme reluctance" to intervene in judicial

review should be examined, in order to understand the larger picture.

The discretion to institute criminal proceedings is generally referred

to as the "prosecutorial discretion" in the Common law jurisdiction. The

Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecution is mandated with

the prosecutorial powers to institute criminal proceedings as the case may

be.

The origins of the prosecutorial powers were considered in the

Canadian Supreme Court judgment of Keieger v Law Society of Alberta

[2002] 3 S.c.R. 372, when their Lordships have quoted from the text of

Controlling Prosecutorial Powers - Judicial review, Abuse of Process and Section

7 of "The Charter" (1986-87), 29 Crim. L.Q.15, at pp. 20-21, reproduced

below;

"Most [prosecutorial powers J derive . . . from the royal

prerogative, defined by Dicey as the residue of discretionary

or arbitrary authority residing in the hands of the Crown at

any given time. Prerogative powers are essentially those

granted by the common law to the Crown that are not

shared by the Crown's subjects. While executive action

carried out under their aegis conforms with the rule of law,

prerogative powers are subject to the supremacy of

35

Parliament, since they may be curtailed or abolished by

statute. "

The term "prosecutorial discretion" has regularly been used in the

Common law jurisdictions both in its judicial pronouncements and in

academic writings. In identifying the legitimate scope of the term

"prosecutorial discretion", the Supreme Court states;

" ... what is common to the various elements of prosecutorial

discretion is that they involve the ultimate decisions as to

whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or

ceased, and what the prosecution ought to be for. Put

differently, prosecutorial discretion refers to decisions

regarding the nature and extent of the prosecution and the

Attorney General's participation in it. Decisions that do not

go to the nature and extent of the prosecution, i.e., the

decisions that govern a Crown prosecutor's tactics or

conduct before the court, do not fall within the scope

of prosecutorial discretion."

In this same judgment, the Supreme Court added to this description

of prosecutorial discretion, as the following;

"Prosecutorial discretion is a term of art. It does not simply

refer to any discretionary decision made by a Crown

prosecutor. Prosecutorial discretion refers to the use of those

powers that constitute the core of the Attorney General's

office and which are protected from the influence of improper

36

political and other vitiating factors by the principle of

independence. "

The Canadian Supreme Court then refers to some instances where

the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is requiI:ed. Some of the instances

where such discretion is exercised are identified by the Court includes the

instances where the prosecuting authority was to decide whether to bring

the prosecution of a charge whether to enter a stay of proceedings in either

a private or public prosecution; whether to accept a guilty plea to a lesser

charge; whether to withdraw from criminal proceedings altogether; and

whether to take control of a private prosecution.

The Court emphasises the underlying policy objectives In

conferment of prosecutorial discretion and the manner in which it should

be exercised. It states that, such discretion is conferred on prosecuting

authority only" ... in advancing the public interest by enabling prosecutors to

make discretionary decisions in fulfilment of their professional obligations without

fear of judicial or political interference, thus fulfilling their quasi-judicial role as

'ministers ofjustice'" citing one of its earlier decisions.

The approach of the English Courts also seems to be on the same

line of thinking as of its Canadian counterpart. The Privy Council, in

exercising its appellate powers over an appeal preferred by the former

Chief Justice of Trinidad and Tobago, to avert the imminent prospect of

being prosecuted on a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice,

sought judicial review from the Court of Appeal of this country. Having

37

denied relief by the local Court he had then appealed to the Privy Council.

In delivering its judgment in Sharma v Deputy Director of Public

Prosecutions & Others, (Supra) in dismissing the appeal Lord Bingham

has stated as follows;

"It is the duty of police officers and prosecutors engaged in

the investigation of alleged offences and the initiation of

prosecutions to exercIse an independent, objective,

professional judgment on the facts of each case. It not

infrequently happens that there is strong political and public

feeling that a particular suspect or class of suspect should be

prosecuted and convicted. Those suspected of terrorism,

hijacking or child abuse are obvious examples. This is

inevitable, and not in itself harmful so long as those

professionally charged with the investigation of offences and

the institution of prosecutions do not allow their awareness

of political or public opinion to sway their professional

judgment. It is a grave violation of their professional and

legal duty to allow their judgment to be swayed by

extraneous considerations such as political pressure."

Having traced the historical origins of prosecutorial powers in

Keieger v Law Society of Alberta (supra) the Canadian Supreme Court

also considered the impact on the criminal justice system, if the Courts

were to undertake judicial review on the exercise of prosecutorial

discretion, as not only would it violate the concept of separation of powers

but as a result, would also lead to a paradoxical situation as referred to in

the quotation below. 38

In R v Power [1994]1 S.C.R. 601, the Court accepted that;

"It is fundamental to our system of justice that criminal

proceedings be conducted in public before an independen t

and impartial tribunal. If the court is to review the

prosecutor's exercise of his discretion the Court becomes a

supervisin~ prosecutor. It ceases to be an independent

tribunal. (Emphasis in original)

In adopting a more pragmatic approach, the Canadian Supreme

Court by its judgment of R v Anderson [2014] 2 S.c.R. 167, stated, if it were

to "enormously expand the scope of judicial review of discretionary decisions

made by prosecutors" as the appellant argues before their Lordships, then;

" .... In doing so, it puts at risk the adversarial nature of our

criminal justice system by hobbling Crown prosecutors in

the performance of their work and by inviting judicial

oversight of the numerous decisions that Crown prosecutors

make on a daily basis."

The Court of Appeal judgment of A v R [2012] EWCA Crim 434,

reflects a similar approach of the English Courts on the scope of the

judicial review of prosecutorial discretion. Lord Judge CJ states;

" ... that the decision whether to prosecute or not must

always be made by the Crown Prosecution Service and not

the Court. The Court does not make prosecutorial decisions.

Second, provided there is evidence from which the jury may

properly convict, it can only be in the rarest circumstances

that the prosecution may be required to justify the decision to

39

prosecute. Third, the decision whether or not to prosecute in

most cases requires a judgment to be made about a

multiplicity of interlocking circumstances."

Lord Salmon, in DPP v Humphrys [1977] AC 1, was of the view;

" ... a judge has not and should not appear to have any for

the insti tu tion of prosecu tions, nor has he any power to

refuse to allow a prosecution to proceed merely because he

considers that, as a matter of policy, it ought not to have

been brought. "

In Sharma v Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions & Others

(supra), the Privy Council had identified the following reasons from the

judicial precedents to explain the" extreme reluctance", (as their

Lordships preferred to describe its approach), shown by Courts to disturb

decisions to prosecute, by way of judicial review;

a. "the great width of the OPP's discretion and the polycentric character of

official decision-making in such matters including policy and public

interest considerations which are not susceptible of judicial review because

it is within neither the constitutional function nor the practical competence

of the Courts to assess their merits"

b. "the wide range of factors relating to available evidence, the public interest

and perhaps other matters which [the prosecutor] may properly take into

account"

40

c. "the delay inevitably caused to the criminal trial if it proceeds"

d. "the desirability of all challenges taking place in the criminal trial or on

appeal"

e. "that the trial process itself is equipped to deal with the bulk of complaints

which have in recent Divisional Court cases founded applications for a

stay. "

f "In addition to the safeguards afforded to the defendant in a criminal trial,

the Court has a well-established power to restrain proceedings which are an

abuse of its process, even where such abuse does not compromise the

fairness of the trial itself"

g. "the blurring of the executive function of the prosecutor and the judicial

function of the court, and of the distinct roles of the criminal and the civil

Courts".

Despite the proclaimed "extreme reluctance" to intervene, the

Higher Judiciaries of Canada and United Kingdom, have, in an

unambiguous and precise terms, expressed that the prosecutorial

discretion is amenable to judicial review, subject to several self-imposed

limitations, depending on the peculiarities of their respective jurisdictions.

Therefore, it is important and relevant to dedicate some space in this

judgment to consider the exact scope of the judicial review, as undertaken

by these two countries.

41

The Canadian approach is such that the prosecutorial discretion is

"only reviewable for abuse of process" whilst identifying another category

titled "tactics and conduct" of the prosecutors before trial Courts, which

attracts a different set of considerations in judicial review as per R v

Anderson (supra). The difference of the approach in judicial review of

these two categories were explained in the said judgment as it would

depend on whether the prosecuting authority has exercised its discretion

over its "core functions" in the impugned instance, which is reviewable

solely on the basis of "abuse of process", or whether the prosecuting

authority was merely acting on a "tactical decision" outside of its core

functions, where the remedy would be for the Court to exercise its

"inherent jurisdiction to control its own processes even in the absence of abuse of

process" .

In the English Courts, the oft quoted and relied on authority on the

scope of review seems to be the judgment of the House of Lords in DPP v

ex parte Kebeline and Others [1999] UKHL 43, where the Respondents

have successfully invited the Divisional Court to judicially review a

decision of the DPP to consent to a prosecution, was considered in appeal.

The appeal by the DPP was allowed.

In the judgment of the House of Lords, Lord Steyn, with whom

Lord Slynn and Lord Cooke agreed, it was observed;

"My Lords, I would rule that absent dishonesty

or mala fides or an exceptional circumstance, the decision of

the DPP to consent to the prosecution of the Respondents is

42

not amenable to judicial review. And I would further rule

that the present case falls on the wrong side of that line.

While the passing of the Human Rights Act marked a great

advance for our criminal justice system it is in my view

vitally important that, so far as the courts are concerned, its

application in our law should take place in an orderly

manner which recognises the desirability of all challenges

taking place in the criminal trial or on appeal. The effect of

the judgment of the Divisional Court was to open the door

too widely to delay in the conduct of criminal proceedings."

The strictness in which this principle was applied is indicative from

the statement of Lord Judge CJ, in A v R (Supra) where it is stated that;

" ... We have detected the development of what may, if not

arrested at an early stage, become a new form of satellite

litigation, in which the exercise of the prosecutorial

discretion is made subject to a judicial review or abuse of

process/stay of proceedings argument in the Crown Court .

... As to judicial review, there can, we suggest, be very few

occasions indeed when an application for permission by or on

behalf of a defendant should not be refused at the outset on

the basis that an alternative remedy is available in the Crown

Court. "

Applying this principle to an instance where the prosecuting

authority decided not to prosecute, then in such a situation, the Courts

43

have held that judicial review is the only available remedy as per Reg. v

DPP. Ex parte C [1995]1 Cr.App.R.136.

The admitted reluctance of the Canadian and English Courts in

judicial review of prosecutorial discretion is not confined to that

jurisdiction only. In Sri Lanka, although the judgments were delivered in

exercising its appellate and revisionary jurisdiction, our Superior Courts

too have clearly indicated their reluctance to intervene as well by

restricting intervention only to the most deserving instances.

In The King v Fernando (supra) Layard CJ states;

"[ do not think that it is desirable in every case to interfere

with the discretion vested in the Attorney-General. The only

cases in which this Court should in terfere is when the

Attorney-General has abused the discretion left to him, and

these cases are very rarely likely to arise."

A similar approach was adopted in The King v Baba Singho (supra),

as the Court held;

"... it is within the discretion of the A ttorney-General to

direct to what Court a case shall be committed and what

offence he shall be indicted for, and it appears to me that it

should only be in some extreme case that the Court of Appeal

should interfere with the discretion so given to him and

direct a trial in a different Court."

44

In delivering the judgments of The Queen v Gunawardene (Supra)

and The Queen v Liyanage (Supra) the respective Trials at Bar clearly

questioned its jurisdiction to challenge the prosecutorial discretion. The

judgment of The Queen v Gunawardene states;

"If the A ttorney-General in whom rests the discretion either

to proceed by indictment or information takes the view that

the imputations tend to disturb or endanger the

Government, it seems to us that it is impossible to hold,

assuming that we have the power to review that discretion,

that that view is wrong",

while the judgment of The Queen v Liyanage held that;

"The second plea is that the Attorney-General should have

satisfied this Court that he had good reason for proceeding by

way of information instead of by indictment. The answer to

this is that Section 440A(6) empowers the Attorney-General

to exhibit Information in respect of the offences now charged

against these defendants, and the section contains no

conditions as to how the Attorney-General should exercise

his discretion. Nor do we think we have the power to

question the exercise of the Attorney-General's discretion in

this matter."

Weeramantry J, while sitting alone in the judgment of Velu v Velu

and another (supra) observed that;

45

" the Attorney-General is vested with a measure of

discretion which is rendered effective by his statutory power

to secure that inquiries under Chapter 16 will terminate in a

manner determined in the exercise of that discretion. Into the

sphere where this discretion is exercised it is not the province

of this Court to enter save for the gravest cause."

In view of these pronouncements, it is clear that the prosecutorial

discretion is reviewed in English Courts as well as in Sri Lanka, In

exercising its powers of judicial review only when there is material to

satisfy that the decision to prosecute was taken in extreme situations akin

to "dishonesty or mala fides or an exceptional circumstance" warranting

effective judicial intervention.

Unlike Section 29(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, which governs

the issuance of prerogative writs by the High Court of England, except to

"matters relating to trial on indictments", this Court derives its jurisdiction to

issue such orders under Article 140 of the Constitution. The said Article

confers this Court with jurisdiction to " .. . grant and issue, according to law,

orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and

quo warran to" .

The term" according to law" was originally contained in Section 42 of

the Courts Ordinance and had conferred jurisdiction on the then Supreme

Court to issue prerogative writs, before it was finally included in Article

140 of the Constitution conferring such jurisdiction on this Court. . This

46

particular term was interpreted by the Privy Council, in its judgment of

Nakkuda Ali v Jayaratne (Controller of Testiles) 51 NLR 457, where Lord

Radcliff stated that;

" ... there can be no alternative to the view that when s. 42

gives power to issue these mandates" according to law" it is

the relevant rules of English common law that must be

resorted to in order to ascertain in what circumstances and

under what conditions the Court, may be moved for the issue

of a prerogative writ. These rules then must themselves

guide the practice of the Supreme Court in Ceylon."

Therefore, the English law principles on judicial review of the

prosecutorial discretion is applicable to the instant application by the

Petitioner by which he sought to challenge the validity of an indictment

against him by seeking issuance of several prerogative writs.

As previously noted, the Respondents have appeared before this

Court on notice being served on them by the Petitioner, since he sought

interim relief upon notice. In these circumstances, at this stage of the

proceedings, where the Petitioner only supported his application for

formal notice on the Respondents and also for interim relief, the objective

of this Court is to assess the submissions of the parties in the light of their

respective pleadings and decide whether the Petitioner has established a

prima facie case.

47

It has already been decided that the Petitioner must prima facie satisfy

this Court, upon the material he had pleaded, that the 6th Respondent took

the decision to prosecute him "dishonesty or mala fides or an exceptional

circumstance".

The indirect submission on illegality and procedural impropriety in

respect of Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act had already been dealt

with by this Court in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment. The other

complaint the Petitioner relied on is the denial of an opportunity for the

Petitioner to make a revealing statement by which he intends to provide

valuable information to incriminate his co accused and also to extricate

himself of criminal liability.

The contention advanced by the Petitioner and the 14th Respondent

is that he was ordered to make a statement on or before 26.06.2019 by the

Magistrate's Court but even before that time period was fully exhausted,

the 6th Respondent had proceeded with filing of an indictment before the

Permanent High Court at Bar. It is alleged that the CID, on their part also

had acted illegally when they filed a report under Section 120(3) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.1S of 1979, confirming the terminal

point of their investigation against the Petitioner and others before the

expiration of the time period mentioned in the Court order.

It is obvious that the said contention is based upon the premise that

provisions contained in Section 120(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code are

mandatory in nature and therefore imposes an inviolable prerequisite in

48

the institution of proceedings. It was also founded upon the premise that,

in order to institute criminal proceedings, a prior recording of a statement

from the intended accused is a mandatory prerequisite.

This Court would first deal with the contention in relation to Section

120(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which states

that;

U As soon as the investigation is completed the officer in

charge of the police station shall forward to such Court a

report in the prescribed form. If in the report there is no

allegation that the suspect has committed or been concerned

in the committing of any offence the Magistrate shall

discharge him. If the report alleges that the suspect has

committed or been concerned with commission of an offence

he shall be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of

this Code. U

The Section contains statutory provisions regulating three situations.

Firstly, it imposes a duty on the inquirers to inform the Magistrate's Court

of the fact that the investigations have been completed. Secondly, if there

is no allegation of committing an offence then the suspect is entitled to be

discharged. Thirdly, if the report alleges that the suspect has U committed or

been concerned with commission of an offence, then he shall be prosecuted in

accordance with the provisions of the Code.

49

I I j I I

In this instance, the CID had in fact tendered a report to Court

informing of the completion of its investigation. The second part of the

Section has no application to the instant matter. The third part, that if the

report alleges the suspect has "committed or been concerned with commission

of an offence, then he shall be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions

of the Code, merely makes it mandatory that the suspect be prosecuted

according to the statutory regime put in place by the Legislature in the

form of Act No. 15 of 1979. There is no indication in the language of the

said Section even to infer that the institution of criminal proceedings

should take place only after the report is filed.

In practical terms, the Officer-in-Charge will know the point of time

that the investigation he commenced with the reception of the 1st

information has reached its logical conclusion. The Section is meant to

ensure there is no undue delay in completion of investigations. The first

part of the Section imposes a mandatory duty on him to inform Court,

under whose supervision he acted, that the investigation has reached its

completion. In reaching the second or third stages, the Officer-in-Charge of

investigation must first decide the outcome of the investigations he had

conducted and concluded. At that stage if he is of the view that there was

no material to conclude that he could make an allegation of committing an

offence, then the second part applies by discharging of the suspect by

Court. If he is of the opinion that the suspect has "committed or been

concerned with commission of an offence, then, the legal duty is imposed that

such a suspect" shall be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of the

Code". At this stage, the necessity arises as to the determination by the

50

police or with the advice of the of the 6th Respondent of the Court, in

which the institution of proceedings should be made. If it is the

Magistrate's Court, then with the completion of investigation, and

reporting to Court of the completion of investigation the institution of

proceedings could follow seamlessly. Situation could be different if the

proceedings are instituted in any other Court except the Magistrate's

Court.

The 6th Respondent is invested with the prosecutorial discretion in

determining the Court in which the proceedings should be instituted. He

was tasked to advice the investigators by Section 393(2) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Section 393(1) the said Act empowers him to

forward indictments to the High Court of the Republic and also to exhibit

information before Trial at Bar appointed by His Lordship the Chief

Justice. He could also advice the investigators to institute proceedings

before the Magistrate's Court either as a preliminary inquiry or as a

summary prosecution. As noted earlier on, in addition to provisions of

Section 450 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, by Section 12A(I)(a) of

the Judicature Act, the 6th Respondent is invested with the discretionary

power to request for a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice to

institute proceedings before the High Court at Bar and Permanent High

Court at Bar, respectively.

In this instance, the 6th Respondent intended to institute criminal

proceedings against the Petitioner and others before the Permanent High

Court at Bar under Section 393(1) of the Act No. 15 of 1979 as Section 120(3)

Sl

I

provides for, by acting under the provisions of Section 12A(4)(a) of the

Judicature Act and Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of

1948, as amended by Act No. 16 of 2008, subject to the direction of His

Lordship the Chief Justice.

Section 120 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

imposes several responsibilities to the "Officer-in- Charge of a police

station" or to an "inquirer". There is no indication in the Section that these

responsibilities are equally applicable to the 6th Respondent, whose powers

are defined in Chapter XXXIII of the said Act.

In the limited objections of the 1st to 7th Respondents, it is stated that

the report informing Court of the completion of the investigations was filed

on 13.06.2019 ("RIO"). By this report, the cm reported to Court that the

investigations are completed and the 6th Respondent has informed them by

a letter dated 10.06.2019, that a request was made under Section 12A(4)(a)

of the Judicature Act for a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice to

institute criminal proceedings against the Petitioner and other suspects

before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

By the time the 6th Respondent, sought the direction of His_Lordship

the Chief Justice under Section 12A(4)(a), he should have decided on the

available material whether to institute criminal proceedings against the

Petitioner or not, as otherwise, he cannot seek a direction as per the

provisions of Section 12A(4)(a). The direction under the said Section is

sought in respect of " whether criminal proceedings in respect of such offence be

52

instituted in the Permanent High Court at Bar" and not whether to institute

proceedings in respect of such offence.

The complaint of the Petitioner in this regard is twofold. He

contends that without the proper completion of investigations (due to

failure to record his statement), the 6th Respondent cannot seek a direction

from His Lordship the Chief Justice. The reason he attributes is, in such a

situation, the 6th Respondent is unable to take into consideration of the four

"fetters" as found in Section 12A(4)(a), in the absence of the Petitioner's

statement. He then couples the decision of the 6th Respondent to seek a

direction with the decision to prosecute.

The consideration of the Petitioner's complaint brings this Court to

the point where it had to consider whether the Petitioner's statement is a

mandatory requirement for an investigation to be considered as complete.

In Victor Ivan v Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General & Another

(supra) it was emphasised by the Supreme Court that;

"A citizen is entitled to a proper investigation - one which is

fair, competent, timely and appropriate - of a criminal

complaint, whether it be by him or against him. The criminal

law exists for the protection of his rights - of person,

property and reputation - and lack of a due investigation

will deprive him of the protection of the law".

53

Professor Peiris, in his book titled Criminal Procedure in Sri Lanka

under the Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973,states (at p.35) that the

purpose of police conducting investigation is "threefold" and proceeds to

describe them as follows;

1. to ascertain whether a crime has been committed,

n. to discover the identity of the offender, if a crime is shown to

have been committed; and

iii. to collect evidence with a view to securing the conviction of

the offender in subsequent proceedings.

Therefore, it is a legal requirement that the investigators should

conduct a proper investigation. Such an investigation should ideally

include the statement of witnesses in support of the allegation and identity

of the offender. In addition it should include, a statement by the suspect

and of his witnesses. The investigators should also conduct further

investigations, after hearing the suspect's version and of his witnesses if

they found it necessary.

In this particular instance admittedly there is no statement recorded

from the Petitioner. The question therefore arises whether the fact that the

statement of the Petitioner is not recorded, could be considered as a failure

to fulfil a mandatory statutory requirement in the completion of

investigations?

Learned Additional Solicitor General rightly pOints out that the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 does not contain any statutory

54

provision by which the Legislature has imposed such a mandatory

legislative duty on the inquirers by recording the statement of a suspect,

prior to completion of an investigation.

Sections 109 and 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 regulates the procedure of recording statements in relation to

witnesses as well as suspects as it does not recognise any difference

Relevant part of Section 110 (1) reads as follows;

"Any police officer or inquirer making an investigation

under this Chapter may examine orally any person supposed

to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the

case,"

And

"If the police officer or inquirer asks any question in

clarification such question and the answer given thereto shall

be recorded in form of question and answer."

Section 110(2) clearly defines the nature of protection afforded to

suspects in recognition of the rule against self-incrimination. Said section

reads as follows;

"Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions

relating to such case put to him by such officer or inquirer

other than questions which would have a tendency to expose

him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture".

55

Section 110(3) clearly demarcates the legitimate use of the contents of

a statement whilst protecting the interests of an accused. The Section reads;

" A statement made by any person to a police officer in the

course of any investigation may be used in accordance with

the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance excep t for the

purpose of corroborating the testimony of such person in

court;

Provided that a statement made by an accused person in the

course of any investigation shall only be used to prove that he

made a different statement at a different time.

Anything in this subsection shall not be deemed to apply to

any statement falling within the provisions of section 27 of

the Evidence Ordinance or to prevent any statement made by

a person in the course of any investigation being used as

evidence in a charge under section 180 of the Penal Code.

The scope of the provisions of Section 110 was extensively dealt with

by a divisional bench of the Supreme Court in Rupasinghe v Attorney

General (1986) 2 Sri L.R. 329. It was contended before their Lordships that

during the investigations the investigators have acted in violation of the

provisions of Section 110 of the Criminal Procedure Code as they fail to

recognise the appellants "right to silence" and also failed to accept his

"exculpatory statement".

The apex Court has held;

56

"In Sri Lanka, unlike in England, the right to silence is

restricted only to questions which would have a tendency to

expose any person to a criminal charge or to a penal ty or

forfeiture. This has been the law in Sri Lanka for a

considerable period of time. Under section 110 (1) the police

are invested with powers during the investigations of

offences of examining "orally any person supposed to be

acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case." In

Sri Lanka, unlike in England, a reciprocal obligation is

imposed on the person interrelated, in that such person is

dec/ared to be "bound to answer truly all questions relating

to such case pu t to him by a police officer or inquirer other

than questions which have a tendency to expose him, to a

criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.". In Sri Lanka

the right to silence has been and is governed by statute and

such questions are not determined by the English Common

Law and the English decisions pertaining thereto."

Had the Petitioner decided to make a statement, it would have been

recorded under these provisions and the investigators were bound to

acknowledge his right to silence as to the" questions which have a tendency to

expose him, to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture". In relation to any

other question put to him by the investigators, he is "bound to answer truly

all questions relating to such case".

This judgment clearly states that;

57

"There is a statutonJ immunity in our law given to a suspect

to decline to answer any incriminating questions put by the

police. However, ifhe does make an incriminating statement

in answer to questions by the police that statement shall not

be proved against him at his trial as section 25 of the

Evidence Ordinance expressly forbids it subject to the

proviso in section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance."

Section 111 imposes a duty on investigators that they "shall not offer

or make or cause to be offered or made any inducement, threat, promise to any

person charged with an offence to induce such person to make any statement."

If the suspect is already in custody, a statement could easily be

recorded subject to the provisions of Section 110. If the suspect is in Sri

Lanka, then there are provisions under which the investigators could

secure his attendance to record a statement. As in the case of the

Petitioner, who had located himself in a place where such provisions are

unenforceable, unless he voluntarily submits himself to its jurisdiction,

there is no opportunity to record a statement in the absence of his intension

and willingness to do so.

If the Courts were to accept that there must be a statement of a

suspect, in order to lawfully conclude an investigation against him, then,

adoption of such an argument will only result in placing a suspect, who

prefers to evade justice, in a more advantageous position than the

applicable law had ever envisaged or permitted and the suspect who is in

Sri Lanka. 58

The 14th Respondent, who echoed the submissions of the Petitioner

and contended that the failure to record a statement is a denial of a fair

investigation, did not address this aspect in his submissions.

The Petitioner complains to this Court that he could have provided

information that would have convinced the CID and the Attorney General

that there exists the four "fetters" as required by Section 12A(4)(a) of the

Judicature Act. If there was an opportunity to put such questions to him

and his answers could be disqualified by the provisions of Section 110(2) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as it tends indirectly to "expose him, to

a criminal charge".

In the eyes of the investigators, the conduct of the Petitioner had not

evinced any confidence in them that he would return to Sri Lanka in the

near future and make a statement as he indicated in his correspondence.

This seems to be a justifiable suspicion on their part, since even in his

petition to this Court, there is no indication that the Petitioner was at least

making plans to return to Sri Lanka or in order to fulfil his undertaking to

make known his "response", had made some preparatory arrangements in

view of that undertaking.

Having considered the applicable legal provisions in relation to

recording of statements and of conclusion of investigations, this Court now

turns its attention to consider the contention whether that the Petitioner

had entertained legitimate expectation of the procedural fairness in view

59

of the order issued by the Magistrate's Court to appear before CID on or

before 26.06.2019.

It appears that the learned President's Counsel for Petitioner, in view

of the learned Additional Solicitors General's submission that there is no

statutory duty to record a statement of a suspect, has sought to fill this

Legislative "gap" in the statutorily laid down criminal procedure, by

bridging it with public law consideration of legitimate expectation. His

attempt to merge the public law principle of legitimate expectation with

the statutorily laid down criminal procedure, in the context of determining

the validity of his complaint on deprivation of procedural fairness, needs

judicial confirmation.

Unlike in the general decision making process of public officers,

where there are no clearly laid down procedures to follow, in relation to

conduct of investigations, institution of proceedings, trials in relation to

the commission of offences are heavily regulated by statutorily laid down

procedure. The Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, which

replaced the Administration of Justice Law No. 42 of 1973, has regulated

criminal proceedings in Sri Lanka for well over four decades with a

substantial collection of judicial interpretations on its permissible scope.

The number of local authorities cited in this judgment itself is a testimony

of that feature and also is a confirmation that the statutory provisions

contained therein have adequately protected the interest of the suspects as

well as the accused.

60

The English Courts have displayed a certain degree of reluctance to

apply public law principles in relation to Criminal Justice system, as they

did with judicial review of prosecutorial discretion. The Court of Appeal,

in its judgment of R v AT [2019] EWCA Crim 647 reiterated the principle

that;

" conduct which might prevent a public authority from

conducting itself as it might othenvise do as a matter

of Public Law was not necessarily of such a kind as to

present a challenge to the integrity of the criminal justice

system, and to underline the fact that, for the powerful

reasons given in Sharma v Browne-Antoine [2007J 1

WLR 780, orders to quash decisions to prosecute are very

rarely granted. He opined that the observations of the Court

in that case were equally potent in suggesting that a stay

should be even more rare."

When a challenge on the prosecutorial discretion is based

particularly on the public law principle of legitimate expectation, the Court

of Appeal had indicated there is no shift or change of its approach. In R v

Drury and Others [2001] EWCA Crim 975, it is stated;

"In the case of ex parte Kebilene, the Divisional Court

certified as a point of law of general public importance

whether, pending the coming into force of its substantive

provisions, the enactment of the Human Rights Act

1998, gave rise to an enforceable legitimate expectation that

the Director of Public Prosecutions would exercise

his prosecutorial discretion in accordance with the ECHR.

61

The Divisional Court and the House of Lords had no

difficulty in dismissing such a suggestion in terms which

give no comfort to the argument that public law principles

applicable to general policy decisions are apt to be applied in

relation to particular decisions on procedural and evidential

matters taken by the prosecution ... "

In R v AT (supra) , when it was complained to the Court of Appeal

by the Applicant that a decision to prosecute him had already been made

by the time of his last communication with the Chief Inspector and that

was deliberately withheld either from or by the Chief Inspector in

persuading him to return to the United Kingdom by creating a legitimate

expectation in him based on that communication, the Court held that the

Applicant never received a categorical assurance that he would not be

prosecuted and it seemed the Applicant did not trust the assurance he was

given and also knew that he was taking a risk. In these circumstances it

was held that;

" The Judge was also right not to concern himself

with whether there might have been, in public law

terms, a legitimate expectation. As he concluded, the

introduction of that concept into an application to

stay as an abuse of process in criminal proceedings

(on the basis that a trial would offend the court's

sense of justice and propriety, or undermine

confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it

into disrepute) runs the risk of watering down the test

62

and (we would add) of unnecessarily confusing the

issue. As the Judge put it "The public law concept of

legitimate expectation sits uneasily with the hopes

and fears of a person suspected on reasonable grounds

of having committed serious criminal offences and

facing prosecutions for them. That person has the

protections of the criminal law and of Article 6, and is

entitled, as a matter of law to a fair trial. The role of

any expectation that person might have as to how he

will be treated. "

Even in an instance where the institution of a prosecution was

challenged on the basis of deviating from the publicly declared policy in

the Leal Guidance Manual, the Court remained unmoved. This was an

instance where by a general charging advice, stressing the point that

money laundering is an area where careful exercise of prosecutorial

discretion is required is included in the manual for prosecutors. When

challenged the decision to prosecute on the basis of legitimate expectation,

the Court in its judgment of Crown Prosecution Service, Nottinghamshire

v Kevin Rose [2008] EWCA Crim 239, adopted the reasoning in the

judgment of R (Wilkinson) v Director of Public Prosecutions [2006]

EWHC 3012 (Admin) where Kay LJ observed;

" .. . [Having considered the Code for Crown Prosecutors and .. the CPS's own document on money laundering, IfeeI unable

to say that the decision to proceed under s.329 was arguably

vitiated by some public law consideration. The passages to

63

which we have been referred seem to me to be encouragement

to crown prosecutors to resort to offences under the 2002 Act

in serious cases. They are less obviously expressed as

discouragement to resort to offences in less serious cases, of

which this is one. The question of who should be charged and

with what offence is essentially one for the Crown

Prosecution Service."

The judgment of R v Drury and Others (Supra) is an instance where

the Court had reluctantly considered the facts of the case in relation to the

application of the principles of legitimate expectation by making reference

to a precedent, whilst stressing its non-applicability. The Court said;

"Even if we accepted (as we do not) the relevance of

the public law principle of legitimate expectation in a case of

this kind, and even if (which we doubt) the appellants'

expectation can be characterised as one of a substantive,

rather than merely procedural, benefit, we also note the

statement in Coughlan at 645E that:

'Here, too, the court will in a proper case decide

whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that

to take a new and different course will amount to an

abuse of power. Here, once the legitimacy of the

expectation is established, the court will have the task

of weighing the requirements of fairness against any

overriding interest relied upon for the change of

policy.'

64

Pausing only to observe that the expression 'abuse of power'

in that passage is not the same as 'abuse of process' in

criminal proceedings, the approach referred to does not seem

to us very different from that required of the court when

weighing the countervailing considerations of policy and

jus tice ... ".

In A v R (supra) the Court sought to justify the deviation from a laid

down policy in the institution of prosecution, by acknowledging the

prosecution's entitlement to such a deviation. It was observed;

" ... even if it can be shown that in one respect or another,

part or parts of the relevant guidance or policy have not been

adhered to, it does not follow that there was an abuse of

process. Indeed, it remains open to the prosecution in an

individual case, for good reason, to disapply its own policy or

guidance. "

The contention that the Magisterial order, directing him to appear

before the cm on or before 26.06.2019, made him legitimately expect that

the investigations would not be completed without recording his

statement, should be considered in relation to the factual circumstances as

averred by the Petitioner as well as the 1st to 7th Respondents. The

Petitioner contends that the investigations are not complete, in spite of the

filing of the report under Section 120(3) of the CPC, since no forensic audit

report was finalised at that point of time and in the absence of his

statement and therefore the reporting to the Court by the CID that the

investigations are complete is made arbitrarily, capriciously, unreasonably,

65

vexatiously, irrationally and by deprivation of the Petitioner's legitimate

expectation and procedural fairness.

Referring to the factual position, the Petitioner submitted that, he

entertained a legitimate expectation in preparing himself to make a

statement with the assistance of his legal advisor, before the date as

specified in the order of the Court, but well before the expiration of the

time period afforded by Court. However, the crD in informing Court that

the investigations are completed before the said date, deprived him of any

reasonable and fair opportunity to provide his statement before the

deadline.

The Petitioner stresses to this Court that the taint that was

introduced to the investigation by denying him of an opportunity to make

a statement had contaminated the decision to indict him before the High

Court at Bar since he should have been given a chance to make his

statement before being indicted by the 6th Respondent simply because

without hearing the Petitioner, the 6th Respondent is not in a position to

appreciate and assess the mandatory "fetters" put in place by Section

12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act.

Since the Petitioner claims that he entertained legitimate expectation

that the investigations would not be concluded without his statement

being recorded demands an inquiry into his conduct in order to satisfy this

Court whether he did act on such an expectation as per R v Al (Supra)

66

The Petitioner, is a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and the United

Kingdom. During the time period applicable to the investigations referred

to in this Petition, he resided in Singapore. The legal status of the

Petitioner in relation to his stay in Singapore is not known. It is admitted

that he had left Sri Lanka in June 2018, and it appears from the material

before this Court that since then he had not returned.

The Presidential Commission, having concluded investigations as

per its mandate, issued the final report on 30.12.2017. In the said report,

the Commission made several recommendations, including that" ... the

Hon. Attorney General or other appropriate authority should consider whether the

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. is liable for prosecutions for an offence in terms of the

aforesaid Section 56A(1) of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance" ..

The Commission, having investigated into the Treasury Bond

Auction on 27.02.2015, identified that there were market manipulations,

insider dealings and other illegalities and was of the view that ".. . the

evidence establishes that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., has made the major part of its

profit by using 'insider information' and by means of 'market manipulations"'. It

then recommended appropriate proceedings be instituted against the said

Company.

It is alleged by the 1st to 7th Respondents that the Petitioner was a

director of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, during the period 18.02.2015 to

18.07.2017. It is specifically alleged that the Petitioner was a director of the

said Company prior to and on the date of the Treasury Bond Auction

67

conducted on 27.02.2015. According to the 1st to 7th Respondents,

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd was a key perpetrator of the offences identified

and "in view of the onerous responsibility cast on the directors of a Company,

with regard to the conduct of the Company, which is a legal person, and in view of

the necessity to establish the mental element of an offence in respect of a charge

under the Penal Code, it was the responsibility of the law enforcement authorities

to include the directors of the Company in any indictment or charges to be served

on the Company itself'.

It is in these circumstances that the CID took steps to name the

Directors of the said Company as suspects in case No. B 8266/2018 of the

Chief Magistrate's Court on the advice of the 6th Respondent.

In their limited objections, the 1st to 7th Respondents have sought to

refute the allegation of procedural unfairness by claiming that the

Petitioner has conducted himself in "bad faith", and "deliberately and

tactfully evaded the lawful investigation process set forth in Sri Lanka".

Therefore, this Court will examine the material placed before it, with

a view to assess the validity of the allegation of the Petitioner that he was

informed denied of an opportunity to make a statement in violation of his

legitimate expectations.

The 1st email,sentby the 2nd Respondent is dated 29.03.2019,by

which it was informed that the Petitioner has been named as a suspect and

the necessity to record his statement. He was directed to appear before the

68

2nd Respondent on or before 05.04.2019. The 2nd Respondent also sought

the postal address of the Petitioner. The Petitioner was served with a

document, depicting the nature of the charges as an attachment to this

particular email.

In his reply, the Petitioner clarified with the 2nd Respondent whether

he could make his statement via email. It was informed to the Petitioner

by the 2nd Respondent's 2nd email that it was not legally permissible. The

2nd Respondent also provided an opportunity to the Petitioner to provide

his "position" known via email on 04.04.2019, and the CID is prepared to

conduct further investigations, if necessary. The request for the

Petitioner's postal address was made once again. The Petitioner then

replied by email on 5.04.2019 that the annexure is in Sinhala language and

he needed two weeks to "respond".

However, the Petitioner did not respond even after two weeks with

his "response" nor did he take any steps to provide his personal address.

The facts were reported to Court on 05.04.2019 and an order was obtained

by the CID directing the Petitioner to appear before CID on or before

26.06.2019. The said Court order was delivered to the Petitioner via a

courier service on 26.04.2019 to the Postal address obtained by the CID,

through the interviews it had conducted with the Petitioner's parents who

resided in Sri Lanka. The Petitioner claims his parents were "harassed"

by theCID.

69

The next email sent by the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent was on

10.06.2019 by which the Petitioner confirmed the service of Court order on

him and appraised the 2nd Respondent of the fact that he had retained the

services of an Attorney-at-Law. The Petitioner clarifies that he had retained

legal Counsel, in order to obtain" legal advice on how I could best assist and

cooperate with the investigations while reserving my rights and liberty, given that

I had already been named as a suspect."

He further informs the 2nd Respondent that he is aware that the 6th

Respondent had already decided to indict him and sought sanction for a

Trial at Bar. He further states "note that in the event Hon. Attorney General

reverses the decision to indict as an accused I am eager to assist this investigation

and provide information, investigative material and evidence that will be valuable

to CIO and to the Han Attorney General" and requests to keep his offer

confidential.

It is relevant to note that the Petitioner never did offer to assist

investigations by providing" information, investigative material and evidence

that will be valuable to em and to the Hon. Attorney General" until the fact

that he was indicted had reached him through news reports. Strangely,

the Petitioner even then preferred to adopt a twin track strategy In

relation to the criminal investigation conducted by the CID. Through his

Attorney, the Petitioner correspond with the 6th Respondent by the letters

dated 10.06.2019 and 18.06.2019, in addition to interviewing several senior

officers of the Attorney General's Department on 13.06.2019 and

14.06.2019, offering his assistance to conduct investigations. On 13.06.2019,

70

the cm filed a report under Section 120(3) of the Criminal Procedure

Code, informing Court that the investigations are completed.

An officer of the said Department replied to the Petitioner's

Attorney on 18.06.2019, informing him that "there is no legal impediment for

your client to appear before the Director of CID and to make a statement and any

disclosure relating to the matters under investigation." The Attorney of the

Petitioner, in his affidavit, stated that he made representations to the 6th

Respondent seeking the Petitioner be "delisted as an accused and listed as

a witness" in the matter pending before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

However, on the last date of the time granted by the Magistrate's

Court directing the Petitioner to appear before cm, i.e. 26.06.2019, the

same Attorney, made submissions to the Chief Magistrate that the said

order was issued per incuriam since the Court had no power to order the

Petitioner to appear before CID. Despite the repeated offers to the 2 nd and

6th Respondents that the Petitioner would assist in investigations, and

despite the report under Section 120(3) being filed, marking the terminal

point of investigations, the Petitioner did not seek further time from Court

to make a statement to the CID or to assist its investigations by seeking an

extension.

By then the 6th Respondent had sought directions from his Lordship

the Chief Justice to institute criminal proceeding before the Permanent

High Court at Bar on 10.06.2019 and finally the indictment was presented

before the Permanent High Court at Bar on 28.06.2019.

It is reasonable to expect from a person who had been named a

"suspect" in a case, to act swiftly to secure his interests and to place any

material in his possession to convince the investigators of his innocence at

the first available opportunity. The Petitioner was aware from the lSi email

sent by the 2nd Respondent that he was named as a suspect. That was on

29.03.2019. The Petitioner, in his reply sought time to study the annexure

and to respond within two weeks. That two weeks period ended on

19.04.2019. There was no response from the Petitioner by the 2nd

Respondent until it was reported in the newspapers that the 61h

Respondent has sought a decision from His Lordship the Chief Justice to

indict the Accused before the Permanent High Court at Bar.

The cm obtained a Court order on 05.04.2019, which ordered the

Petitioner to appear before CID on or before 26.06.2019 and served it on

him on 26.04.2019. The Petitioner took about 45 days to respond from the

date of service of the Court order to his last email and made no

declaration .of his intention to return to Sri Lanka or to make a statement,

which he undertook to do within two weeks. On 10.06.2019, the 61h

Respondent had sought a direction from His Lordship the Chief Justice

and, by then, had decided to indict the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, the 2nd and 6th Respondents are justified in

their thinking that the Petitioner's conduct failed to evoke any confidence

and that he is not honest in his declared intentions about making a

statement.

72

The Petitioner described the filing of the indictment was done in

"extreme" and "dubious" haste and alleged" glaring mala fides" on the part

of the 6th Respondent, in deciding to institute criminal proceedings against

him. The "extreme haste", as alleged by the Petitioner, of the 6th

Respondent in indicting him, is also relevant to the area under

consideration.

On 30.12.2017, the Presidential Commission issued report which

contained adverse findings against Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. The 2nd

Respondent has commenced CID investigations on 02.02.2018 regarding

the treasury bond auction conducted on 27.02.2015. It is evident from the

limited objections of the 1st to 7th Respondents that the investigations were

conducted on the advice of the 6th Respondent, which was regularly sought

by theCID.

The 6th Respondent made the request to His Lordship the Chief

Justice on 10.06.2019, more than four years after the auction and 18 months

since the release of the findings of the Presidential Commission. A

considerable amount of time has already elapsed. Clearly the 6th

Respondent had the material collected by the Commission and the CID

when he decided to indict the Petitioner. The 6th Respondent must have

been mindful of the fact that a significant delay has resulted in initiating a

prosecution.

73

The 1st to 7th Respondents had stated in their limited objections that

the Petitioner was a director of the Company prior to and on the date of the

auction and the imputation of criminal liability on the Petitioner was

apparently made on that basis. The Petitioner himself relies on the wide

publicity given to the decision of the 6th Respondent to such a decision

from His Lordship the Chief Justice .

Even if the Petitioner had made a full and truthful disclosure in his

statement, that would not alter the material already before the 6th

Respondent, in determining whether a direction should be sought from His

Lordship the Chief Justice or not, having considered the four "fetters"

referred to in Section 12A(4)(a) of the Judicature Act. On the other hand,

the Petitioner cannot claim that he only had the monopoly of information

as to "the nature and circumstances", "the gravity", "the complexity" and

"the impact on the State", so that without him making a statement, the 6th

Respondent is totally helpless to make a valid determination on that aspect.

Since "mala fide" decisions to prosecute are clearly amenable to

judicial review, it is important that this Court considers the basis of the

Petitioner's allegation that the 6th Respondent had acted mala fide. In

support of the allegation of mala fide on the part of the 6th Respondent, the

following factual situations are relied upon by the Petitioner;

a. in the further report dated 25.03.2019, filed by the cm in

the Magistrate's Court, it was reported to Court that the

Petitioner had left Sri Lanka in June 2018 and In

74

\

confirmation statements of his parents and Grama

Niladhari of the area were recorded, when in fact the

statements of his parents were recorded only on the

following day (26.03.2019) and Grama Niladhari's

statement was recorded, several months later, on

20.07.2019, even after the indictment was filed,

b. the same report described the visit by the Police to the

Petitioner's parent's house to arrest him on 25.03.2019, and

since the report too is filed on the same day, the

improbability of visiting the house and filing report

simultaneously,

c. harassment of the Petitioner's parents by the CID officers

by visiting their residence to serve summons on the

Petitioner on 11.07.2019, when they knew that he is based

in Singapore at that point of time,

d. the 6th Respondent failed to tender a copy of the request

he had addressed to His Lordship the Chief Justice in

seeking a direction to institute proceedings before the

Permanent High Court at Bar,

e. the act by the 6th Respondent in reserving his right to

produce the proceedings before the Chief Magistrate of

Colombo from 05.04.2019 "upon the same becoming

75

available", when in fact the said proceedings are part and

parcel of the proceedings before the Permanent High

Court at Bar, thereby suppressing vital information from

the purview of this Court.

In contrast, the Petitioner claims that he acted with utmost bona fides,

when he volunteered, though in vain, to provide valuable information with

his intended statement.

These factors cannot surely be used to support an allegation of mala

fide of the 6th Respondent in indicting the Petitioner. It is apt to quote

Fernando J, in Victor Ivan v Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General & Another

(supra). His Lordship observed;

"Errors and omissions do occur, and by themselves are not

proof that the impugned decision was arbitrary, capricious,

perverse or unreasonable ... " .

This Court is not convinced of the declared bona fides of the

Petitioner, in view of the considerations in the preceding paragraphs. This

Court is more inclined to accept the allegation of the 1st to 7th Respondents

that the Petitioner deliberately and tactfully evaded the lawful

investigation process, under the guise of offering incriminating material

against his co accused from his trove of information, whilst arranging for

him to be "delis ted" as an accused from the indictment pending before the

Permanent High Court at Bar.

76

'F=============================================~

It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner is not challenging the

indictment on the footing that given the material available before the 6th

Respondent, he could not reasonably have forwarded an indictment.

Instead, the Petitioner harped on the contention that the 6th Respondent

had failed in giving an opportunity for the Petitioner to disclose what he

knew of and to place the Petitioner's side of the story before him. It is also

contended that the impugned action of the 6th Respondent had resulted in

rejecting the offer of material which incriminates other accused and also

exculpates the Petitioner.

In delivering judgment of the apex Court in Sarath de Abrew v

Iddamalgoda and six Others (supra), Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J was of

the view that;

"While I agree with the submissions made by the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner that every power must

be exercised by the authority fairly, reasonably and lawfully,

the mere fact that the statement of witnesses of the defence

has not been recorded as claimed by the Petitioner cannot

make the decision of the Attorney General unsustainable.

The Attorney General's decision to indict the Petitioner may

be vitiated if a conclusion is arrived not on an assessment of

objective facts or evidence but on a subjective satisfaction.

The reason is where the decision is based on the subjective

satisfaction if some of the statements turn out to be

irrelevant, it would be impossible for a Superior Court to

find out which of the statements are relevant or irrelevant, 77

valid or invalid had brought about such satisfaction. But in a

case where a conclusion is based on a collective assessment

such difficulty would not arise. If it is found that there was

evidence before the Attorney General and such evidence had

been considered by several officers of the said Department

and a final decision was reached by the Attorney General

based on the views of the said officers, the Superior Court

would not interfere and would hesitate to substitute its own

view in place of the Attorney General."

In the instant petition, the Petitioner had annexed correspondence

and referred to the interviews his Attorney has had with several senior

officers of the Attorney General's Department. The designation of these

officers range from State Counsel to Additional Solicitor General. This

indicates that the decision to indict the Petitioner was reached as a

collective decision and therefore it is clear to this Court that the allegation

of mala fide on the part of the 6th Respondent had no factual basis

whatsoever.

In view of the conduct of the Petitioner, as the English Courts noted,

even if the principle of legitimate expectation is applicable, the Petitioner

himself made him disqualify from its protection. He, having opted not to

comply with the order of Court and surrender to its direction but instead

chose to challenge the jurisdiction of the Court in making the said order,

and thereby, effectively negated any inference that could have been drawn

in his favour, that he had taken the order of Court seriously and was in the

process of making a statement, in compliance with the said order. 78

'rr=====================================================================~

The Petitioner, through his Attorney, indicated that he intends to

tender incriminating material in relation to the investigation, whilst

making his statement. This offer of assisting investigations consists of three

possible courses of action. The Petitioner could have made a statement,

presumably an exculpating one. He also could have tendered the promised

incriminating material without making a statement, which could have

assisted the investigators in their investigation. He also had the option of

amalgamating other two courses of action by making a statement revealing

incriminatory material against the others, while exculpating himself. But

he opted to do nothing. Despite his repeated undertaking to do so, as

indicative from his correspondence and representations. The CID, on their

part, have initially acted under Section 109(6) by directing the Petitioner to

appear before it. When he failed to appear, realising it was futile to issue a

warrant on him acting under the proviso of Section 109(6), the CID instead

moved Court under Section 124 for an order in assisting investigations,

since the Petitioner was operating from a place, which was beyond their

jurisdiction.

Contrary to the Petitioner's claim that he was deprived of an

opportunity to make a statement, by examination of his conduct, this

Court is of the considered view that it is reasonable to think that the

Petitioner had voluntarily renounced his entitlement to make a statement,

by acting contrary to his declared intentions.

Returning to the question this Court posed earlier on, in this

judgment, namely, whether the fact that the statement of the Petitioner is

79

,

"ir===================================================================~

not recorded could be elevated as a failure to fulfil a mandatory statutory

requirement in the completion of investigations, therefore, should be

answered in the negative. This conclusion is reached by this Court mainly

due to the absence of a specific provision of law declaring that the

investigations cannot be completed without recording a statement of a

suspect and in view of the absurdity of imposition of such a requirement.

Adoption of an interpretation of such a requirement will obviously

lead to absurdity since any absconding suspect could easily hamper an

investigations which would otherwise have reached its practical

conclusion. In doing so, a suspect is benefited in two ways. Without

completion of investigations, there cannot be a prosecution. This will result

in a situation where the suspect will enjoy immunity from criminal

prosecution until and unless he decides to make a statement and complete

the investigation. Clearly this is not what the Legislature intended when it

enacted the provisions of Sections 109 and 110 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.lS of 1979.

Before this Court parts with this judgment, it should deal with the

contention that the offences against the Petitioner are not made out owing

to various factors the Petitioner had relied on.

The Supreme Court, having embarked on a voyage by which it had

exhaustively considered with the issue of the effect of availability of an

alternate remedy in instances of application for judicial review, by its

80

,

judgment of Vanniasingham v Forbes & Another (1993) 2 Sri L.R. 362,

declared that;

U In this area of the law, where there is no illegality, the

Court should first look into the question whether a statute

providing for alternative remedies expressly or by necessary

implication excludes judicial review. If not, where remedies

overlap, the Court should consider whether the statutory

alternative remedy is satisfactory in all the circumstances. If

not, the Court is entitled to review the matter in the exercise

of its jurisdiction. Of course if there is an illegality there is

no question but that the Court can exercise its powers of

review. U

This Court has already decided that there is no illegality in the

decision making process. Therefore, the English as well as Sri Lankan

judicial precedents already referred to have clp.arly stressed that these trial

issues could effectively be dealt with by the trial Court itself at the

appropriate stage.

In these circumstances, this Court is not inclined to issue formal

notice of this application on the 1st to 7th and other Respondents, since the

Petitioner has failed to satisfy that there exists a prima facie matter to be

considered. Consideration of granting of interim relief does not arise in

view of the above finding.
