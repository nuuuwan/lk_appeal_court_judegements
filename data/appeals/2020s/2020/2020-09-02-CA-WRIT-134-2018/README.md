Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

Counsel: Uditha Egalahewa, P.C., with Amaranath

Fernando for the Petitioner.

Shantha Jayawardena with Hirannya

Damunupola for the 3rd Respondent.

Argued on: 22.06.2020

Decided on: 02.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 3rd Respondent is a registered Trade Union. It engaged in

several rounds of discussion with the Petitioner employers on

behalf of the Petitioners employees, who are members of the

said Trade Union, to achieve the work-related demands of the

employees, including salary increase vide, inter alia, A2 to A5.

Having failed in these discussions, the 3rd Respondent by the

letter X3 informed the Petitioners on Friday, March 17, 2006,

that its members would commence a strike action on Monday,

March 20. The Petitioners, on the same day, informed the 3rd

Respondent by X4 that the decision on the demands of the

employees would be communicated on Monday, March 20.

Despite this response, the strike commenced, as scheduled, on

Monday, March 20. However, the strike lasted only a few hours

due to the Petitioners having obtained an enjoining Order from

the District Court preventing the 3rd Respondent from engaging

in the strike action. Soon after serving the enjoining Order on

the 3rd Respondent, the Petitioners on the same day (March 20)

4

proceeded to immediately serve letters of termination on the

employees who engaged in the strike action (amounting to 275

employees in total, according to the 3rd Respondent). One such

letter of termination dated March 20, 2006 is marked A7.

The Minister referred the dispute i.e. whether the said

terminations of employment were justified, and, if not, what

reliefs should be granted to the employees to the Industrial

Court, under section 4(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of

1950, as amended.

After an exhaustive inquiry, at which both parties were fully

represented by senior lawyers, the Industrial Court by the Order

marked P2 directed the Petitioner employers to reinstate the said

employees with back wages.

It is against this Order the Petitioners have filed this application

seeking to quash it by certiorari.

The Petitioners challenge P2 on several grounds. Let me now

consider them one by one.

The first ground is the reference of the Minister is bad in law, in

that, the names listed in the Gazette marked X8 as the

employees whose services were terminated are not accurate.

The Petitioners say some employees entered into settlements,

some are unidentifiable, and some do not have any dispute with

the Petitioners.

5

In fact, this matter was raised before the Industrial Court1

together with another objection (i.e. that a composite reference

to the Industrial Court against six companies is illegal) and the

Industrial Court by the Order marked X14 overruled both

objections.2 The Petitioners came before this Court against X14

and this Court by Judgment dated May 18, 2010 affirmed the

said Order of the Industrial Court. Hence the Petitioners are

debarred from reagitating the same matter again.

Be that as it may, the Petitioners should know which employees

services were terminated as a result of the Trade Union action,

which employees entered into settlements, and which employees

cannot be identified, and separate those employees from others

whose grievances have not yet been addressed. As learned

Counsel for the 3rd Respondent says in his written submission,

if there are such names those names can be separated and

removed. It does not render the Award illegal.

I reject the first ground.

The second ground is the alleged failure on the part of the

Industrial Court to consider the evidence placed before it.

The Petitioners say the Industrial Court analysed the evidence

put forward by the 3rd Respondent in detail but did not do so in

respect of the evidence of the Petitioners. This is not a

reasonable accusation.

1 Vide, inter alia, pages 315, 399, 401 of the Brief. 2 Vide page 403 of the Brief.

6

The Petitioners say no employee whose services were terminated

as a result of the strike action gave evidence before the

Industrial Court. However, the Secretary of the 3rd Respondent

Trade Union gave evidence on behalf of the said employees. It is

this Secretary who negotiated and communicated on behalf of

the employees with the Petitioner employers and therefore was

in a better position to give evidence on the legitimacy of the

Trade Union action. It must be borne in mind that the

termination of services of the employees was due to them

engaging in the strike action and not any other disciplinary

ground, and therefore calling each and every individual

employee to give evidence was not necessary.

The Petitioners say the Industrial Court failed to give due weight

to the document marked X5, which is in favour of the

Petitioners. But X5 has been denied or not accepted as a

genuine document by the 3rd Respondent at the inquiry.3

The Petitioners further say although the Industrial Court

comments in P2 that the documents marked X16-X23 have not

been tendered with the written submissions, the said documents

are available in the Brief. On this basis, the Petitioners say the

Industrial Court did not consider all the evidence when coming

to the impugned decision. Voluminous documentary evidence

was tendered at the inquiry. However, the Petitioners do not say

how or why consideration of the documents marked X16-X23

would have changed the decision of the Industrial Court. Unless

the same is shown to the satisfaction of this Court, this Court

3 Vide pages 1461, 1465, 1467, 1537 of the Brief.

7

cannot set aside the Order of the Industrial Court on this

ground.

I reject the second ground.

The third ground is the Industrial Court failed to consider the

illegality of the strike.

According to section 2 of the Trade Unions Ordinance, No.14 of

1935, as amended, a Trade Union can have as one of its objects

the promotion or organisation of financing of strikes or lock-outs

in any trade or industry or the provision of pay or other benefits

for its members during a strike or lock-out.

The freedom to form and join a Trade Union is a fundamental

right guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.

A workman has the right to engage in a legitimate strike as a

means towards fulfilling legitimate demands. Strike action is a

powerful weapon in the armoury of the workman, making the

reconciliation process between parties easier and quicker. It has

the miraculous power to correct the unequal and incomparable

bargaining position of the employer and employee. Yet, I must

hasten to add, it shall be adopted not as the first resort but

perhaps as the last resort. This does not mean however that

unless all other avenues are exhausted, engaging in a strike is

illegal and therefore termination of service on that ground is

justifiable. Whether or not a strike action is justifiable depends

on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. It is

presumed a workman who engages in a strike has no intention

of terminating his employment. Rather, in doing so, he asserts

8

his commitment to the employer but on terms more favourable

to him. A strike per se is not an illegal act. (Rubberite Company

Ltd. v. Labour Officer, Negombo [1990] 2 Sri LR 42, Best Footwear

(Pvt) Ltd. v. Aboosaly, Former Minister of Labour and Vocational

Training [1997] 2 Sri LR 137.)

The Industrial Court was not of the opinion the strike action

taken by the 3rd Respondent was illegal. I have no reason to

disagree.

The last ground urged by the Petitioners is the proceedings

before the Industrial Court is ultra vires, as there was no proper

quorum of the Court.

The Minister referred the dispute to the Industrial Court to be

heard by three members. The Petitioners say approximately 31

days of the proceedings were conducted in the presence of only

two members and, therefore, the entire proceedings including

the Order shall be quashed.

As I stated earlier, at the inquiry before the Industrial Court, the

Petitioners were represented by eminent lawyers.

This is not a new objection taken up for the first time in this

Court. This matter was raised before the Industrial Court by

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners eight years after

the commencement of the proceedings in the Industrial Court.4

On that occasion, learned Presidents Counsel candidly accepted

that the proceedings had been duly conducted before two

4 Vide page 1235 of the Brief.

9

members with the consent of both parties.5 As I understand,

learned Presidents Counsel made an application to the

Industrial Court to adjourn the inquiry on that day and proceed

with the further inquiry in the presence of all three members

from that point onwards.6 This application was allowed by the

Industrial Court.7 Thereafter, Petitioners Counsel moved to file

affidavit evidence in lieu of oral evidence, which was also

allowed.8 All three members of the Industrial Court were

present thereafter without any absence. This means the lapse, if

any, in respect of the quorum of the Industrial Court was

perpetuated and thereafter rectified with the consent of the

Petitioner employers. Having so acted, the Petitioners cannot

now move this Court to quash the entire proceedings ab initio on

the ground there was a lack of quorum in the early proceedings

of the Industrial Court.

Unlike other legislative enactments, the Industrial Disputes Act,

No.43 of 1950, as amended, is silent on the quorum of the

Industrial Court. For instance, section 3(4) read with item 8(2)

of the Schedule to the Consumer Affairs Act, No.9 of 2003,

enacts The quorum for any meeting of the Authority shall be four

members. Section 2 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No.54 of 2006, which introduced

inter alia section 5B to the principal Act, enacts The jurisdiction

of a High Court of a Province referred to in section 5A, shall be

ordinarily exercised at all times by not less than two judges of

that Court, sitting together as such High Court. Section 26(1) of 5 Vide page 1231 of the Brief. 6 Ibid. 7 Vide page 1235. 8 Vide page 1245.

10

the Urban Councils Ordinance and section 26 of the Village

Communities Ordinance similarly stipulate the quorum for

meetings shall be one-third of the members in office on that day.

There is no comparable provision in the Industrial Disputes Act

in relation to the quorum of the Industrial Court.

Instead, section 31(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act states

Whenever an industrial court consists of more than one person

and there is a vacancy in such court, the court may act

notwithstanding such vacancy.

Section 31(5) states No act, proceeding or determination of an

industrial court shall be called in question or invalidated by

reason of any vacancy in the court.

The proceedings and the procedure before Labour Tribunals,

Industrial Courts and Arbitrators shall not be viewed with

rigidity but with flexibility, allowing the said bodies to make just

and equitable Orders that are not unnecessarily constrained by

the strict letter of the law. This shall not be misconstrued to

mean such bodies can make illegal orders. Section 24(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act says:

It shall be the duty of an industrial court to which any

dispute, application or question or other matter is referred

or made under this Act, as soon as may be, to make all

such inquiries and hear all such evidence, as it may

consider necessary, and thereafter to take such decision or

make such award as may appear to the court just and

equitable. (emphasis added)

11

Sections 17(1) and 31C of the Industrial Disputes Act allow the

Arbitrator and the Labour Tribunal, respectively, to make such

Orders as may appear to the Arbitrator and Labour Tribunal to

be just and equitable.

In United Engineering Workers Union v. Devanayagam (1967) 69

NLR 289, the Privy Council stated:

The powers and duties of an Arbitrator under the Industrial

Disputes Act, of an Industrial Court and of a Labour

Tribunal on a reference of an industrial dispute are the

same. In relation to an arbitration, the Arbitrator must hear

the evidence tendered by the parties. So must a Labour

Tribunal on a reference. An Industrial Court has to hear

such evidence as it considers necessary. In each case the

award has to be one which appears to the Arbitrator, the

Labour Tribunal or the Industrial Court just and equitable.

No other criterion is laid down. They are given an unfettered

discretion to do what they think is right and fair.

This view has been expressed in numerous Judgments handed

down by our superior Courts, including Thirunavakarasu v.

Siriwardena [1981] 1 Sri LR 185, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v.

Minister of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at

249, Brown & Company PLC v. Minister of Labour [2011] 1 Sri LR

305 at 316-317, Asian Hotels and Properties PLC v. Benjamin

[2013] 1 Sri LR 407 at 419.

12

Nevertheless, the discretionary power of these bodies is not

unfettered. Such discretion shall be exercised not arbitrarily but

reasonably. Whether or not it is correctly exercised can be

tested through judicial review.

I take the view the temporary absence of a member of the

Industrial Court on some days of the proceedings does not ipso

facto invalidate the entire proceedings, unless this Court can be

convinced with cogent reasons that a party to the proceedings

was prejudicially affected by such a lapse. I must also add that

whilst actively taking part at the inquiry before the Industrial

Court despite the lack of quorum and thereby acquiescing to it,

a party cannot later complain of the same when he realises the

final Order is against him.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners has not cited any

authorities whereby a decision of the Industrial Court has been

set aside on lack of quorum. The cases cited relate to different

inquiries. The Industrial Disputes Act serves a distinct purpose.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I have no hesitation

in concluding that the Petitioners shall fail on this last ground

as well.

The impugned decision of the Industrial Court in the instant

case is neither irrational nor perverse.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioners with costs.
