Grounds of challenge of the decision (P9 and Order (PIO)

marked P 10 on the h'Tound that die 2'" ,lI1d W' Respondents had acted ultra

vires and widlOUt jurisdiction. The main two grounds relied on by die

Petitioner to challenge die decision marked 1'9 ,lI1e1 order m,u'ked PI 0 are

,L~ follows:

I. The Petitioner being a joint ten<ll1t cultivator of die paddy l'lI1ds in

question witJI his two brotJlers c<llmot be orelereel to pay ,UTears of

rent for tJle entire 15 Ih acres in tellllS of section IJ. (I) of tJle Act,

a. 'vVhere there is an error on the (;1(e of the proceedings.

First ground of challenge of the the decision P9 and order PIO

1121 At the he,u'ing, the le,u'ned President's CounsclliJl' tlle Petjtioner, Mr.

Ma.l1oh;ua de Silva submitted Ulal the Petitioner is only one of Ule temU1t

cultivators of ule paddy lands in dispute and sub-section I of section if. of

Ule Agrarian Services Act limits the light of a ten,U1t cultivator to cultivate a

paddy l,lIld to a maximum extent of 5 acres. The content jon advanced hy

Mr. de Silva was Ul<lt accordingly, ule Petjtioner heing one of the ten,lIlt

cultivators cannot be directed to pay the ground rent lur more than .'i acres

,U1d Ulerel()re, Ule Inquiring Ollicer (3"' Respondent) and the Assist,U1t

Commissioner (2'" Respondent) had acted ultra Vlies and without

jurisdiction.

II :~I On tlle other h,U1d, tJle suhmission of tJle learned President's Counsel

Illr ule if.'h to 8'" Respondents, Mr. K,u'iappa was Ulat sub-section (l) only

provides a protection to a tenant cultivator lur a maximum extent of 5

acres, hut it docs not prohibit a ten,lIlt cultivator from cultivating the entire

l,tIld as long as tJle owners of tJle paddy i;Uld permit him to do so and tJle

rent is duly paid by tJle ten,tIlt cultivator to tJle owners in respect of tJle

entire land. He fi.lrUler submitted that Ule Petitioner who is admittedly the

sole temll1t cultjvator of the entire paddy l;U1ds in question ,U1d failed to IJ<IY

Ule rent at least in respect of I /:~ of ule paddy lands is not entiued to reiy

on tJle ceiling specified in sub-section (l) or tJle Act.

1111 In view or the all)resaid submissions, tJlis Court IS first invited to

consider ule lollowing questions:

I. Has tJle Petitioner cultivated the paddy l;U1ds in question togetJler

witJI his two hrotJlers as joint temU1t cultivators in terms or the

provisions or ule Aj.,'r,ui'lI1 Services Act;'

( I' \ (""0 \1''19112003 H.< .- \1111];]n,- H.< .I' EI'/ I "Ill \ "'i/\\ R rI (.2/n

2. Is dIe Petitioner die sole ten;mt cultivator of die entire paddy I;mds

in question in extent of 15 Y2 acres and if so, has he litiled to pay dIe

ground rent to die owners of die paddy lands from 1989/90 MalIa

season to 1996/97 Malia seasoni'

a. Has die Lel,rislature in placing a ceiling of 5 acres in sub-section (I)

of section 1\. of the Agr;u'ian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 only

restricted die protection of dIe temmt cultivator to cultivate die

maximum extent of a paddy land to 5 acres!'

1\.. If the tenant cultivator relies on dIe concept of ceiling in subsection

(I) of section Ij., is he obliged to select die m;u(imum extent specified

in sub-section (I) ;md vacate die excess land in terms of sub-section

3 of section 1\. of die Acti)

Ceiling in sub-section (1) of section 4 of ilie Agrarian Services Act

1151 In view of dIe submissions of bodl Counsel, I shall first examine die

scheme of section -1 of the Agr;u'i;m Sen~ces Act 10 58 of 1979 ;uld

consider whedler die prohibition in sub-section (1) applies to the Petitioner

in die present case as conlended by Mr. de Silva. Section -1 of die A!"T;u'i;m

Selvices Act No. 58 of 1979 as amended by Act No. -1 of 1991 was to the

I!lllowing ellect:

Responden t~ from directing the Petitioner to pay the arrears of rent in

respect of (he paddy I;Ulds in question under section 18 (I) of the Act.

Is the Petitioner a joint tenant cultivator or a sole tenant cultivator of the

entire paddy lands in extent of 15 1,2 acres?

11 81 It is useful to bear in mind the leg-a! character of a "cultjvator" as

defiled in section 61l of tlle Act No. 58 of 1979. It reads as lollows:

11 91 T he Petitioner has admitted in paragraph I of tlle Petition elated

19.05.2003 tllat he was the sole tenant cultivator of two paddy l;mds in

1201 In SUppOlt of his submission that the Petitioner ;Uld his two brothers

are joint tenant cultivators of the two paddy lands in question, Mr. de Silva

strongly relied on Ule enuies made in the Agricultural I"uHls Rel,rister at

Season of 1989/ 1990.

1:361 Mr.de Silva drew our attention to the principle of law that in a rei

Ifli](h"caljo action, even if ule Plaintiff asked for a declaration of tiue to ule

property in suit as the sale owner, he is en tided to eject a trespasser even

ulough he !;ws to establish ulat he is ule sole owner provided however, he

establishes dlat he is a co-owner. He submitted that the s,une principle

applies here. His contention was dial die Petitioner asked lor a declaration

ti'om the District Court that he was die ten;U1t cultivator ,Uld flllther prayed

lor illl ~iectment of ule Trustees who wrongllilly ejected die joint tenillit

cultivators from the paddy lillids in question.

1:371 In H;uiette If PalJullasili 1996 (1) Sri LR 358, S. N. Silva,.r. (as he dlen

was) held dlat our law reco/,'llizes die right of co-owner to sue a trespasser

to have his title to illl undivided share clechu'ecl ,Uld for ejectment of die

tresp,l~ser ti'om die whole lmd because tlle owner of tlle undivided share

has ,Ul interest in every pillt and parcel of ule entire lillicl. The principle of

lillul applies upon proof dlat he is a co-owner of tlle whole land. But such

was not die case formulated by tlle Petitioner in ule District Court of

Petitioner seeking a deci;mltion dlat he is the sole tenant cultivator of tlle

henelicial legislation which was created to provide relieL" to tenant

1511 The pre,ullble to tJlC Act rccognises one of tJle bcncficial purposes of

hy relieving them of onerous obligations undcr contracts entercd into hy

individuals witJl whom tJley st,lIId in celiain relations is a hcneficial

lehrisl<ltion (Bindra's Interprctation of Statutes 10'" Ed, p. BIj, I). AltJlough a

section of a statute has to he intcrpreted according to its plain words and

without doing violence to tllc I;Ul/,'1Iage used hy tJlC Ic/,rislature, thc

benelicial piece of legislation should he interpreted in a purposivc man ncr

which would ellectl.late the o l ~ jec t of the welfiu'e or beneficial legislation

(N agpur Di~/n( t CCllln il Co-opcl 'llivc Bank v. Slale o/ M;ilw<lshIJ<I, 1987

interpreted in such <I w<ly tJlat it <ldv<lnces tJle ol.Jject ,U1d tllc purpose of tJle

legislation ,md gives it a full me,ming and eflect, so tJl<lt tJle uitim<lte soci<ll

M;UJagcm cllt o/fll(hiUJ SI;UJd;uc/.\ fllSlJiulioll, (1 976) 1 U,J 33,:~<) (Se)). It

becomes tJle duty of tJle court to interpret a provision, especi'llly a welfare

or beneficial statute hy giving it a wider me;Uling ratJler tJI<m a rcstrictive

me'Uling. It is well-settlcd canon of construction that in construing the

illusory (CI"im;uwu- Kad,,;U7 akis Mudll/ G'oullder ]I. Ay'va]loo alias

Pen;7JJa G'ouJlderAIR 1982 SC 137).

1531 Thus, a beneficial piece of lel,rislation has to be construed in its correct

perspective so as to Ii-uctif), ule lel,rislative intent underlying its enactment

(supra). An interpretation of a section ulat adv,U1ces Ule o~iect and policy

of an Act is more beneficial to the tenant cultivator and Ule landlord, has to

be preferred ( Color-Chem Ltd ]I All Alaspur/w- & Odlen (1998) 3 SCC

192. The provisions of such ilIl Act Cill1l10t be interpreted in such a manner

as to hring about a result, so plainly contTilIY to tJle object ilIld ule policy of

ule lel,rislation, oUlelwise ule intention of Ule lel,rislation would be defeated

(AJJdhra H;UJrlloom Wea]len' Co-op Society ]I State oIAndhl;/ Pradesh

AIR 1964 AP 363-6t1.).

15t1,1 The legislative intent of the Agrariilll Services Act in introducing Ule

concept of ceiling in sub-section (I) GU1l10t be gaulered by adopting a strict

ilIld restrictive interpretation to its words. The legislative intent should be

gatJlered by reading section I\. in it'; entirety, ule context o~iect ,mel purpose

of tJle ceiling ,md its operation wiulin ule overall scheme of section 4

enacted by ule legislature.

1551 Sub-section (I) limits the ma.ximum extent of padely lillHI Ulat Cilll be

cultivated by a tenant cultivator to 5 acres, while sub-section (2) empowers

tJle Minister to further limit ule extent of paddy l,mel Ulat GU1 be cultivated

by a tenilll! cultivator. The proviso to sub-section (2) of section 4 deals wiul

a specific class of cases, nillnely ulat of tenilllt cultivators who ilI-e also

select select Ule ext.ent of paddy I;Uld which he is entiued Lo cultivaLe ,Uld

vacaLe ule balance extent on being ordered to do so by ule Commissioner.

1591 The Courts cannot disreg,ml ule lel,>islative intenL of sub-section (3

when a tenant cultivator is in occupation of an extent of a paddy I;Uld in

excess of ule maximum of 5 acres specified in sub-section (I). The overall

oQject and policy of ule lel,>islature in section 1\ is not only for Ule benefit of

the temUlt cultivator, but also for ule benefit of ule owners of Ule paddy

I;Uld. Sub-section (3) of section 1\, in my view, has struck a balance belween

ule tenant cultivator who is in occupation of an exlent of paddy I,md in

excess of ule extent specified in sub-section (I) ,Uld ule righl of ule owner

10 be entiued to cultivate ule ba.I;Ulce extent subject to ule approval of Ihe

Commissioner.

1601 Sub-section (3) reflects ule legislature's intent by equally providing it

relief to Ule owners of Ule paddy I,Ulds to utilize ule balance extent ulat is

released by Ule tenant alter ule Len,Ult cultivator having selecled his 5 acres

,Uld vacated Ule bal;Ulce extent on being ordered to do so by ule

Commissioner. It seems Ulat sub-section (3) is intended t.o govern die

ceiling in sub-section (I) where ule tenant cultivator fails to select his

m,Lximull1 extent of 5 acres ,Uld vacates ule bal,Ulce extent, but continues to

occupy t.lle whole paddy I,Uld in defeating ule scheme of section 1\ inlended

by Ule lei,>islatl.lre. [n 1517];uebbe v. AssistiUlt COllJmissioller of" AgriU1;1Il

words, ule issue was wheUler ule proviso to sub-section (2) applied only

where the Minister determines the extent of paddv land cultivable by a

lemUlt cullivator under suh-seclion (2.). Their Lordships of Ule Supreme

(I' \ (rHO \1''. ?lnOOJ 11.( .-Ampar.- II.C.!"\;EI'/A" B/. \PWWRIT 62197

tlle proviso to sub-section (2) IS intended to govern tlle cOlHents of botll

subsections (1) ,lIld (2).

16 II In tlle present Gl~e, no material is available that ,lilY specilic order was

made by tlle Minister so I;lr in terms of sub-section (2) applicable to the

AmfJara District in which !lIe disfJuted p,lddy land is situated or in ;lIlY

district in tlle Isl;lIld. The question dlen arises whedler sub-section (a)

brings into [(Irce solely upon die Minister making an order in terms of sub-

section (2) ,lIlel if so, whether, in the absence of an order made by tlle

Minister, the oper,ltion of sub-section (a) is of no 1(IITe. If tlle position is

tllat suh-section (a) applies only to a case of a ten,Ult cultivator in a district

to which an order made hy the Minister relates as contemplated in sub-

section (2), die concept of tlle ceiling ,uJ(1 tlle legislative ol~ject in section 1/.

including the mech,Ulism set out in sub-section (a) will be me'Ulingless.

1621 Further, if tllat position is correct, de,u'lv die ten,Ult cultivator who

occupies the entire I;Uld in excess of die maximum extent of!i acres is not

obliged to select tlle m,Lximllm extent of!i acres, vacate tlle excess land ,uJ(1

pay the arre;u's of rent in respect of tlle entire I;lIld of which he is 111

occupation unless ,Ul order is made hy tlle Minister in ,UlY district as

contemplated hy sub-section (2). If that posilion is correct, tlle owners will

never be able to utilize the excess I;Uld ,Uld demand die ,UTears of rent in

respect of !lIe entire I,Uld ,lIld tlle Comlllissioner cannot give effect to sub-

section (:~), unless ill] order is made by the Minister in any district as

contemplated by suh-section (2).

1631 To accept such ,Ul absurd rationale is totally against !lIe lc!,oislative

intent of a beneficial piece of legislation which is not intended to justify a

diflerent treatment to henclici,u"ies. As stated hy O,lIIkwert L,j. stated at

1611 The scheme introduced by section 1 of the Agrari;m Services Act is

not only tor the benefit of tenant cultivators but also tor the benefit of the

owners. Sub-section (3) has clearly stmck a bal;mce to ensurc that the

ceiling in sub-section (I) is eHcctuaily implemented for tlle benefit of both

the temmt cultivator and the owners, In my view the sub-section (I) should

be read together witJI sub-section (3) if tJle tenant cultivator is in occupation

of ;1I1 extent of paddy land in excess of tJle extent specified in sub-section

(I) irrespective of whetJler a Minister has made an order in tellllS of sub-

section (2),

1651 If tJle contention is tJlat sub-section (3) brings into force upon tJlC

Minister making an order in terms of sub-section (2), tJle Commissioner

would he barred in giving etlcct to tJle legislative intent in sub-section (3)

and the ten;mt cultivator would continue to occupy tJle whole land witJlOut

has provided tJle ;lIlswer in s;ucgu;u'ding tJle rights of botJl tJlC tenant

a. the light to legal representation;

1. the light to cross ex,Ulline and

5. the right to know tJle reasons lor the decision.

Right to have notice of the charges made against him

1751 To constitute a I;tir hearing, tJle most important element is tJlat the

person accused should know the nature of tJle charges made ai,'ilinat him

and tJlat he should he given ,1.11 opportunity to state his case (l/l1iveHliy oj"

Ceylol1 v. Fel7l;Uldo (sllpra). The ollject of notice is that an 0ppOltunity is

provided to the person so dlat he C;Ul equip himself to derend ltis case.

Obviously, dIe requirement dlat a person be given ,1.11 opportunity to be

he,ml is not met by simply serving on him notice of the time 'l.I1d place at

which a heating is to take place. Thus, unless a person knows what kind of

case he will have to meet, he is not, in 'l.I1y reaJ sense of tJ,e words, being

given an oPPOltunity to be heard (R. v. NortiJ: Ey P;ute O;uwy (1927) I K.

B. 1\,9 'l.I1el Edward I. Sykes, Cases and Materials on Administrative Law, 1\,'"

Ed. p. 208).

1761 In the present C;L~e, dle Petitioner has admitted dlat he was

summoned to attend ,1.11 inquiry atHI accordingly, tJle Petitioner had

attended the s,tid inquiry held on 25.0a.1997 (p,u"agraph 9 of die Petition).

By letter dated 01.0:~.1997 m,u"ked 1'5 (page 115 or the briel), dIe 2"'

1771 It is crystal clc;u' that the Pctitioner had hecn inl(lI'Illed of the nature of

the allcgation madc hy the Trustees against him ill '\';lmillangllagc together

with tllc nature of dlc extent of die paddy 1;U1ds in rcspect of which dlc

Petjtioner had I;liled to pay, dlc period of non-paymcnt of dIe rcnt ;U1d dIe

section under which die inquiry will be held against him. Accordingly, the

by dIe Tilistees of die Templc, togethcr with all ncccssarv inl()rmation to

enahle him to prep;u'e his delence.

The right to be given a reasonable opportunity to present one's case and legal representation at the inquiry

1781 Thc Petitioncr has complained th;tt hc sought a postponemcnt of the

inquiry to enable him to be dclended hy a lawver, hut the Inquiring Otlicer

proceeded widl dte inquiry without giving ;U1 oPPOltunity to be reprcsented

by a lawyer. He has furthcr wmplaincd that dlc Inquiring Ollicer

wrongfully I;uled to record his request and proceeded to he;u' die evidence,

ignoring his right to be rcpresented hy a lawyer. (Vide-Iellcr dated

2G.Oa.1997 addressed to the 2'"' Respondcn miu'ked 1'7- page 109 or dte

1791 In reg;mlto legal represcntation in administrative inquiries, dIe courts

have held that dIe legal reprcscntatJon is not avail;thle in administratJve

proceedings as of a right but the tribunal has a discretjon to gr;U1! legal

1851 The letter calling upon the Petitioner to attend an inquiry under

section 18 (J) together with dIe nature of dIe charges made against him had

been sent on 01.03.1997 and dIe inquil)' was held on 25.03.1997. The

Petitioner has admitted dIe receipt of dIe said letter and dlat he attended

the said inquiry on 25.03.1997. The record, however, does not indicate

dlat any request was made by dIe Petitioner at the inquil)' lor ;lI1Y legal

representation or cross ex,unination of the witness called by dIe owners or

dIe paddy lands.

1861 I evcrdleless, the summons dated 05.03. 1997 sent to dIe Petitioner

by dlc 2"" Respondent was not a sudden ,lI1d unexpected summon to

appe;u' belore die AI,'Tarian Services Oflice tor ,lI1 inquil)'. The Petitioner is

not an illiterate person. The Petitioner had attended at several inquiries

held at dIe Ollice of die 2"" Respondent prior to die inquiry was held on

25.03.1 997. The record bears testimony to dIe fact dlat the Petitioner is a

seasoned person who had participated in a number of inquiries belore die

Commissioner with or witJlout legal representation (see- page I:H. of dIe

bl;ef) ,lI1d addrcssed several letters to die Conll1lissioner (1'7 at page 109).

The Petitioner was the sole Plaintilr in dIe D.C. Kalmunai Case bearing

No. I<)jMICS ,md Respondent in dIe Appeal hied in dIe Supreme Court

,md dIe Court or Appeal.

1871 l Jnder such circumst;mces, dIe Petjtioncr who had notice of the nature

of dIe ch,u"ges made against him was well aware that the nature of dIe

inquilY to be conducted by the Inquiring Ollicer ,uHl dIe evidence given in

Tamil hmguage will be translated into Sinhala by dIe Translators in the

O~lice or the 2'"' Respondent. The Petitioner had adequate time (21 days)

to prepare I(Jr his detence ,md make arr,mgements to retain a lawver as he

had previously done.

1881 The Petitioner was well aw,u"e that on 02.12.l99G (R4 (a), dIe

Commissioner had decided that his brothers ;u'e not the tenant cultivators

or the paddy lands in question. The Petitioner in my view had ample time

to retain a lawyer ;md attend dIe inquiry held on 25.0:~.1997. The

Petitioner's complaint that the Inquiring Ollicer bliled to grant a

postponement I()r the inquiry in my view, is not credible. The Petitjoner by

his own admission had attended dIe inquiry wid lOUt dIe service or a

lawyer, participated in dIe inquiry and given evidence on oath and

presented his case and thus, he is not entided to complain dlat dlere was a

breach of dIe principle or natural justke lor tJle I;ulure of dIe Inquiring

Ollicer to postpone the inquiry to enable him to retain a lawyer.

1891 The important question, however, is whedler dIe Petjtjoner was given

a hdl ,mel reasonable opportunity I()r stating his own case ,md given a Itlll

1991 At the said appeal, a prelimin,uy o~iection was raised by die tI.'" to 8"'

Respondents dlat the appeal is not properly constituted as die appeUant

had not lodged the notice of appeal in die High Court wid lin a period of

I tI. days li'OIl] d1e date of die order appealed. The Court of Appeal by

order dated 28.01.200a upheld die prelimin,uy ol~iection ,lI1d dismissed

die appeal (X.'i). The Petitioner had liled a special leave to appeal against

die said order of die Court of Appeal but the said special leave to appeal

application had been widl(lrawll in view of the present revision application

filed by die Petitioner in die Court of Appeal (vide- page -1 of die written

submissions tiled on behalf of the Petitioner).

11001 A perusal of the seulement entered 111 die prevIous reVISIOn

application bearing No. ii/99 reveals tll,lt the said revision application was

dismissed when die Petitioner agreeing to deposit die ,lrrears of rent lor die

entire period ;Uld dIe parties agreeing dlat dIe settlement will be wid lOut

pr~judice to dIe rights of dIe parties in dIe pending appeal bearing o.

1/99. The said appeal was dismissed on a technical !,'round and not on dIe

merits and as dIe Petjtioner had no odIeI' remedy to seek a detel1llination

of his rights, dIe Petitioner had liled dIe present revision application.

11011 In Perera v. Mud/alib 45 NLR 112, SoertszJ set out dIe revisionary

powers of dIe lormer Supreme Court ;Uld held dlat revisionary powers of

dIe Supreme Court are not limited to dIOse cases in which appeal lies or in

which no appeal has been taken for some reason. Soel1sz, J further stated

at page 113 dlat dIe COUI1 would exercise revisionary powers where dlere

has been a misc;uTiage of justice owing to dIe violation of a fundamental

rule of judicial procedure, but dlat dlis power would be exercised only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscaniage of

justice. Even dlOugh dIe Court has dIe power to act in revision whedler an

appeal has been taken or not, such (lowers, dillS, would be exercised only

in exceptional circumstances (Thilafjd/a fJwl1 v. EcliiisiJ7glie (1982 (1) Sri

LR 56).

11021 It is to be noted dlat dIe decisions sought to be challenged by way of

writ jurisdiction was only confined to dIe decision (1'9) and order (P I 0)

directing dIe Petitioner to pay d Ie ground rent in a sum of Hs. 338,t1.000/-.

There is no order whatsoever by dIe Conllilissioner lo r dIe ejectmenl of

dIe Petitioner as dIe ten;Ult cultivator of dIe paddy lands in question.

Iloal Admitedly, dIe petitioner has not paid dIe ground rent lor dIe whole

extent of dIe paddy lands in question from 1989/90 Maha season up to dIe

date of d1e complaint made by dIe Trustees to dIe Commissioner. The

setdement reached in Case bearing No. 6/99 also confirms dIe fact d1at he

had not paid at least I/a of dIe rent hum 1989/90 Maha season to dIe

Trustees.

I [();t1 I hold that tile Petitioner has lililed to make out a strong case

;unounting to a positive misGuTiage of justice owing to a limdaillental rule

of nat1Jraljustice in making tile decision marked P9 ,lIId order m;u'ked PI 0

or fundamental rule of procedure in making the order dated aO.09.199H

being violated. On tile filCtS ;uHI circulllstances of tile case, I hold tllat

tllere is no any illegality of tile Endings made by the 2"" or W' ResJlondents

or the learned High Court:Judge on :~O.O~).I <)<)8

Misrepresentation of Material facts

11051 The ie;mled State Counsel brought to our attention tllat tile

Petitioner had suppressed material lacts which he ought to have disclosed

in tile High Court writ application ,lS correctly observed by tile le;u'ned

High Court:Judge in his order dilled ;~0.09.1998. The 4'" to 8'" Respondents

had produced the documents Ill;u"ked R I to R;[,(a) in support of tlleir

contention illter aiia, tllat tile Petitioner had deliberately suppressed

Illaterial documents from tile Court ;lIId hence, the Petitioner !"Tossly lacks

lIbenin<l fides.

IIOGI I lind t.ll;lt the Petitioner had suppressed Ii"olll tile High Coun tile

letter of tile Commissioner of Agr;u"ian Services (Inquiries) dated

23.03.1987 m;u'ked R I tllat was addressed to the District Court of

Ka.lmunai stating that the Petitioner is tile lawh.I1 tenant cultivator of tile two

paddy lands in question.

11071 The Petitioner had hilled to disclose in tile High Court application

about tile inquil)' held by tile Comillissioller on 02.12.1 <J<J6 ;Uld the

decision (R1 (a) that was held to decide the correctness of the two elltries

tllal appe,u"ed 011 the Agricultural LUlds Register (P I and 1'2). By the said

order, tile Conunissioner has decided that tlle Petitioner is tile tenant

cultivator of the entire land and the two brothers are not the temmt

cultivators.

11 081 A party applying for a prerogative writ is under a duty to the COUlt to

disclose all material hlCts within his knowledge. A prerogative writ C;U1I10t

be issued as of right or as a matter of course, due to its discretionary nature

,md thus, the Petitioner had to make a lid] ,md li-,mk disclosure of all

matters to the CourL. The necessity of a full ,md lilir disclosure of all Ole

material lacts to be placed before Ole Court when ,m application lo r a writ

or injunction is made ,md Ole process of Ole Court is invoked was

emphasized by PaO lir,ma J in W.5. Alphonso Appuhilmy v. Hetti;u,l(lichi

77 NLR 131, 1 :~5.

11 091 In Ole Indi<Ul case of K.D.Sh;uma v. Steel Authonfies o/lnck ? LId &

olilen decided on 09.07.2008, T lmkkerJ stated:

the Petitioner is disenlitled to the discrction;u), rcmcdy of writs on dl,lt

1III1 For diose reasons, I see no reason to interlere widl the judl{ment of
