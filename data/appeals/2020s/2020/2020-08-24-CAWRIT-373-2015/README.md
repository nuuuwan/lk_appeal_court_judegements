Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

By an amended petition dated 18th August 2016, the Petitioner has sought a

Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to permit the Petitioner to pay

the purchase consideration in respect of premises bearing assessment No. 43

1/1, Galle Face Terrace, Colombo 3, and a Writ of Prohibition preventing the

Respondents from alienating the said premises to a third party.

This application has a long history, and it would be important to lay down the

relevant facts at the outset, which I would endeavour to do, as briefly as

possible.

By virtue of Deed of Transfer No. 1676 dated 1st July 1965, Edmund De Silva

Guneratne had become the owner of premises No. 43, Galle Face Terrace,

Colombo 3, on which a condominium property consisting of four units, bearing

3

assessment Nos. 43, 43/1, 43 1/1 and 43 2/1 had been constructed. With the

introduction of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law No. 1 of 1973 (the CHP

Law), any person who owned houses in excess of the permitted number of

houses was required to declare inter alia the number of houses owned by such

person, and the ownership of the houses that such person does not propose to

retain. The said Edmund De Silva Guneratne is said to have declared to the 3rd

Respondent, the Commissioner of National Housing, premises bearing

assessment No. 43 1/1 (the said premises) as an excess house. At the time the

said declaration was made in 1973, the tenant of the said premises had been

Stephen Perera.

The Respondents state that as the information provided by the said Edmund

De Silva Guneratne in the said declaration was inadequate, the Commissioner

of National Housing had requested that a proper declaration be submitted.

However, Edmund De Silva Guneratne had passed away on 9th December 1974,

and it was left to his widow, Anna Louise Guneratne to submit the declaration

with the relevant details.1 By this time, the tenant of the said premises was N.

Thiyagaraja.

Thiyagaraja is said to have executed a Power of Attorney in favour of the

Petitioner permitting him to occupy the said premises, prior to leaving for India

in 1983. By Deed of Transfer No. 409 dated 19th September 1986, Anna Louise

Guneratne had sold premises bearing Assessment Nos. 43, 43/1 and 43 2/1 to

the wife of the Petitioner, Mariam Beevi. Thus, by the latter part of 1986, the

Petitioner and/or his wife was in occupation of the entire property.

It appears that the Petitioner has not handed over the said premises to

Thiyagaraja on his return to Sri Lanka, resulting in Thiyagaraja instituting Case

No. 16024L in the District Court of Colombo in 1992, seeking to eject the

1 Vide R2 dated 9th May 1983.

Petitioner from the said premises. The said action had however been

withdrawn in 1996 due to the plaint not containing a schedule of the land. In

May 1998, the wife of the Petitioner is said to have rented out the said

premises to Nihal Bogahalanda, with the rent being paid to the Petitioner.

There is no dispute among the parties that the said premises, i.e. 43 1/1,

vested in the Commissioner of National Housing with effect from 13th January,

1974. By a notice marked R1 published in Gazette No. 1035 dated 3rd July

1998, in terms of Section 20(1) of the CHP Law,2 the Commissioner of National

Housing had called for claims in respect of the said premises. This Court has

however not been apprised of the response received to R1.

In terms of Section 12(2) of the CHP Law:

Any house vested in the Commissioner under this Law shall, if the

Commissioner proposes to sell such house, be offered for sale, in the first

instance, to the tenant, if any, of such house, and where the tenant does

not accept such offer, the Commissioner may sell such house to any other

person. Where any house vested in the Commissioner is at the time of

vesting not let to a tenant, the Commissioner may sell such house to any

person.

The Petitioner had made an application under Section 12(2) to purchase the

said premises.3 Pursuant to an inquiry held by the Commissioner of National

2 Section 20(1) reads as follows: Where any house is vested in the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall, by notice published in the Gazette and in such other manner as may be determined by him, direct every person who was interested in such house immediately before the date on which such house was so vested to make, within a period of one month reckoned from the date specified in the notice, a written claim to the whole or any part of the price payable under this Law in respect of such house, and to specify in the claim- (a) his name and address, (b) the nature of his interest in such house, (c) the particulars of his claim, and (d) how much of such price is claimed by him. 3 Vide page 4 of R6.

Housing, the Petitioner and the said Thiyagaraja had been informed by a letter

dated 31st July 2002 marked R4 that a decision had been taken by the

Commissioner of National Housing in terms of Section 12(2) to sell the said

premises to Thiyagaraja. In other words, the Commissioner of National Housing

had recognized that Thiyagaraja was the tenant of the said premises.

The Petitioner had challenged the said decision before the Board of Review,

which had dismissed the said appeal having held that the tenant, Thiyagaraja

had a better claim to the said premises than the Petitioner vide R5. The

Petitioner had thereafter filed CA (Writ) Application No. 891/2005 seeking a

Writ of Certiorari to quash R4 and R5. By its judgment delivered on 19th

November 2007, marked R6, this Court had upheld the decisions R4 and

R5. Even though the Petitioner had sought Special Leave to Appeal against

R6, proceedings had been terminated before the Supreme Court subject to

the following:

The order dated 31st July 2002 of the (Commissioner of National Housing)

in favour of (Thiyagaraja) which was challenged in the Court of Appeal is

not operative in view of the death of (Thiyagaraja). Hence, these

proceedings are terminated without prejudice to any steps that may be

taken for succession to the tenancy as referred above.4

The reference to referred to above is to the following sentence in the said

Order The question whether the daughter is entitled to succeed to the rights

of tenancy, if any, of (Thiyagaraja) should be decided in terms of the applicable

law being the Rent Act ...

Having conducted an inquiry in 2010 to determine the entitlement of the

daughter of Thiyagaraja to succeed to the tenancy, the Commissioner of

4 Vide R7 - SC (Spl) L/A Application No. 369/2007; SC Minutes of 27th January 2009.

National Housing had rejected her claim on the basis that she had failed to

establish her claim.5

By a letter dated 2nd September 2009,6 Nihal Bogahalande had informed the

Commissioner of National Housing of the fact that he had rented out the said

premises from the wife of the Petitioner and conveyed his interest to purchase

the said premises. The Commissioner of National Housing, probably realising

that the Petitioner had no right to collect rent for the said premises as he was

neither the owner nor the tenant of the said premises, had informed the said

Nihal Bogahalanda to cease the payment of rent to the Petitioner, as the

premises have been vested in the Commissioner of National Housing, and to

deposit the said sum of money with the National Building Fund.7

The issue that has given rise to this application commenced in 2015, with the

Commissioner of National Housing informing (a) the Petitioner, (b) Nihal

Bogahalanda, and (c) the daughter of Thiyagaraja that they may submit offers

by 15th June 2015 to purchase the said property.8 I must reiterate at this stage

that Section 12(2) of the CHP Law permits the sale of the vested premises to a

third party only where the tenant does not accept the offer made by the

Commissioner to purchase the property, or where there was no tenant at the

time of vesting. None of the parties, namely the Petitioner, Nihal Bogahalanda,

and the daughter of Thiyagaraja had objected to the decision of the

Commissioner to call for bids to sell the property. The right of the

Commissioner to sell the said property in the aforementioned manner has not

been assailed before this Court.

It is not in dispute that while the Petitioner submitted an offer in a sum of Rs.

9,800,000, the offer of Nihal Bogahalanda had been for a sum of Rs. 9,500,000. 5 Vide letter dated 3rd June 2015, marked R15. 6 Vide R10. 7 Vide letter dated 18th March 2011, marked R12. 8 Vide R15 supra.

The Petitioner claims that the Commissioner of National Housing, by a letter

dated 22nd June 2015 marked P6 informed him as follows:

your bid for the above premises has been accepted by me since it was the

highest offer. With the acceptance of your bid you now enter into a legal

contract with the Commissioner of National Housing leaving no room for

litigation unless you violate the terms of settlement of the payment.

In terms of Government Financial Regulations, you are expected to make

an initial deposit of Rs. One Million immediately and the balance sum may

be paid within six months duration in favour of the Housing Development

Authority.

Once you produce the receipt of initial payment to this Office, I do

undertake to make the final order to vest this property either in your name

or your spouse name, subject to the condition that the payment of balance

sum of Rs. Seventy Eight Hundred Thousand (7.8 million) should be

deposited within the stipulated period.

The complaint of the Petitioner in this application is that even though he

received P6, and even though he was willing to make the payment, the

Respondents refused to accept payment. It is in these circumstances that the

Petitioner has filed this application, seeking the aforementioned Writ of

Mandamus directing the Respondents to permit the Petitioner to pay the

purchase consideration for the said premises.

I must observe that although P6 has been written on a letter head of the

Ministry of Housing and Samurdhi, and contains a signature said to be that of

the then Commissioner, who incidentally was due to resign as Commissioner

8

the next day,9 P6 does not contain the designation of the writer, or the seal of

the writer. The Respondents have stated that there has been a serious

violation of the bidding process, in that the Petitioner has been given access to

the bid of Nihal Bogahalanda, thereby enabling the Petitioner to decide the

price that the Petitioner should offer, and violating the level playing field that

must exist in a competitive tender. This is evident by the fact that the

Petitioner has left the value of his bid blank on his offer letter marked R18.

The Respondents have alleged that the bids were opened only in the presence

of the Petitioner and that the value has been filled subsequently by hand.

The Respondents have stated further that by P6, the Petitioner has in fact

been asked to pay only Rs. 8.8m, whereas his bid, assuming that there is no

irregularity, was Rs. 9.8m. All these irregularities have culminated in a

complaint being made to the Commission to investigate allegations of Bribery

and Corruption against the then Commissioner. It is on this factual basis that

the Respondents resisted this application. I must also note that the offer of

Nihal Bogahalanda is conditional, in that he had sought to set off from his offer

price, inter alia the rent paid by him since 1998, to a party other than the

Commissioner of National Housing.

I shall now consider the conditions that must be satisfied for a Writ of

Mandamus to issue. The Supreme Court in Ratnayake and Others vs

C.D.Perera and others10 has held as follows:

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty.

Where officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to

perform, Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty,

9 Vide letter marked R20. 10 [1982] 2 Sri LR 451.

in the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is

only granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and

not merely of private character that is to say for the enforcement of a

mere private right, stemming from a contract of the parties.

The above position has been reiterated in Jayawardena vs. Peoples Bank11

where it was held as follows:

Courts will always be ready and willing to apply the constitutional

remedy of mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must

necessarily be a situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a

public duty an intrusion by this Court by way of mandamus into an area

where remedial measures are available in private law would be to

redefine the availability of a prerogative writ.

The first issue that I must consider is whether the Respondents have a public

duty to perform. The power of the Commissioner to sell any premises vested in

him in terms of the CHP Law has been conferred by Section 12(2) of the CHP

Law. Even though he has the power, there is no obligation on the part of the

Commissioner to sell a house vested in him. However, where he decides to sell

such a house, he is under a legal duty in the first instance to offer the said

house to the tenant. As noted earlier, the Petitioners claim to have the said

premises offered to him on the basis that he is the tenant of the said premises

had been rejected by the Commissioner of National Housing. Therefore the

Commissioner was not under a legal duty to offer the said premises to the

Petitioner.

The tenant of the said premises at the time the declaration was made in 1983

was Thiyagaraja, and the Commissioner did in fact make an order in favour of

11 [2002] 3 Sri LR 17.

10

Thiyagaraja, which order was challenged in CA (Writ) Application No.

891/2005. However, after the death of Thiyagaraja, his successors have not

been recognised as tenants, and therefore, the question of offering for sale the

said house to the tenant does not arise.

The right of the Commissioner to sell the said premises to any other person

arises only if the tenant does not accept the offer, or where at the time of

vesting, the house was not let to a tenant. None of the said situations would

apply in this instance, and therefore the Commissioner is not under a legal

duty to sell the said premises to the Petitioner. In the absence of a legal duty,

this Court cannot compel the Commissioner of National Housing by a Writ of

Mandamus to sell the said premises to the Petitioner.

The situation that has arisen being outside the above two situations provided

for in Section 12(2), the Commissioner, when he called for offers for the sale of

the said premises has acted in the course of his general powers conferred by

Section 12(2). Thus, while the source of his power was statutory, what

followed thereafter was contractual. As held by the Supreme Court of India in

Air India vs Cochin International Airport Ltd12, the award of a contract,

whether it is by a private party or by a public body or the State, is essentially a

commercial transaction.

In Court of Appeal (Writ Application) No. 866/2006,13 Sripavan J (as he then

was) (with Sisira De Abrew J agreeing) has held as follows:

The next question that arises for consideration is whether a writ of

mandamus would lie to compel the second to seventh respondents to

evaluate the tenders in compliance with the tender condition. The general

rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to do

12Case No. Appeal (Civil) 3641 of 1998 - delivered on 31st January 2000 13 CA Minutes of 14th June 2006

11

its duty. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by court

for the performance of a public legal duty. It is granted to compel the

performance of duties of a public nature and not merely of a private

character, namely, for the enforcement of a private right stemming from

the terms and conditions of the tender. The terms and conditions of the

tender do not have the status of law and non-compliance with them

could not be enforced by mandamus.

I therefore take the view that the Petitioner cannot seek a public law remedy

to enforce a purported right of a private character. In any event, given the

aforementioned conduct of the Petitioner relating to the manipulation of the

tender process, I am of the view that in any event, this is not a fit matter where

the discretion of this Court should be exercised in favour of the Petitioner.

Taking into consideration the totality of the material placed before this Court, I

see no legal basis to grant the Writs of Mandamus, and Prohibition prayed for

in the petition. The application of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
