Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Thishya Weragoda with Sanjaya Marambe for the Petitioner Ms. Chandrika Morawaka with Ms. Hemakumari Hettige For the 1st and 2nd Respondents Ms. Nayomi Kahawita, Senior State Counsel for the 3rd and 5th Respondents Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 28th May 2019 Tendered on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents on 7th February 2019 and 19th June 2019 Decided on: 10th June 2020 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up on 14th February 2020, the learned Counsel for

all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions that had already been tendered.

The Petitioner states that he is resident within the administrative limits of the

2nd Respondent, the Urban Council of Kesbewa. In this application, the

Petitioner, who states that he has filed this application on his own behalf as

well as in the public interest, is seeking:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent,

Secretary, Kesbewa Urban Council from imposing; and/or

3

(b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 2nd Respondent or its officers from

collecting,

the following taxes:

a) Annual rates at the rate of 6% for residential properties and 10% for

commercial properties;

b) License fees for businesses carried out within the Urban Council limits of

the 2nd Respondent;

c) A tax of upto 2% on the value of a land in the following instances:

(i) Bare lands which could be cultivated but which are not;

(ii) Bare lands on which buildings could be erected, and upon failure to

erect any building;

(iii) Bare lands which could be developed at a reasonable cost but upon

failure to develop such lands;

(iv) Where the land is covered with a building and where the area

covered by the building, when compared to the whole portion of the

land, does not meet with the expected ratio recommended by the

Urban Council recommendations.

d) An annual charge of Rs. 500 from each Three-wheeler which is parked and

available for hire within the Urban Council limits of the 2nd Respondent.

4

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner sought to challenge the imposition of

the above taxes on two grounds. The first is that the 1st Respondent does not

have the power to impose taxes and that in doing so, the 1st Respondent has

acted ultra vires the powers conferred on the 1st Respondent by the Urban

Councils Ordinance. This ground would apply to all the aforementioned taxes.

It is not in dispute that the power to determine the rates, taxes, duties, levies

and all other charges as specified in the Urban Councils Ordinance for a

particular area is vested with the Urban Council for that area. It is also not in

dispute that the term of office of the elected members of the 2nd Respondent

Urban Council including its Chairman and Vice Chairman had come to an end

by 2016, and that elections to elect the new members did not take place until

February 2018.

Provisions with regard to the administration of an Urban Council during an

interim period where there is no Chairman, Vice Chairman or elected members

are set out in Section 184A of the Urban Councils Ordinance, which reads as

follows:

Where an Urban Council is unable to discharge its functions by reason of

the Chairman and Vice-chairman ceasing to hold office, the Secretary

shall, during any period that elapses between the occurrence of the

vacancies in respect of those offices and the filling of those vacancies in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance, have, exercise, perform and discharge all the rights,

privileges, powers, duties and functions vested in, or conferred or

5

imposed on, the Council, the Chairman or Vice-chairman by this

Ordinance or by any other written law.

It is therefore clear to this Court that during the interim period where a Council

stands dissolved, and until a new Council is constituted subsequent to holding

a general election, the Secretary of the respective Urban Council has been

conferred the power to exercise, perform and discharge all the rights,

privileges, powers, duties and functions vested in, or conferred or imposed by

the Ordinance or by any other written law on:

(a) the Council;

(b) the Chairman;

(c) Vice Chairman.

This Court is therefore satisfied that the 1st Respondent has the power to

exercise all powers conferred on the Council, its Chairman and Vice-Chairman,

as the case may be, when the Council is dissolved. Accordingly, this Court is of

the view that the 1st Respondent had the legal authority and power to impose

the said levies and taxes that are sought to be challenged in this application,

and that her decision is not ultra vires the powers conferred on the Secretary

of the Urban Council by Section 184A of the Ordinance. This Court therefore

does not agree with the first ground placed before this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent acted outside her powers

when she made a decision to impose the said taxes.

6

The second ground urged by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that in

any event, the 2nd Respondent had not followed the procedure prescribed by

law for the imposition of rates. The specific complaint of the Petitioner is that

the 1st Respondent did not obtain the approval of the Minister for the

imposition of the said rates for the year 2018. This Court must note that the

imposition of (a) rates on all premises, and (b) taxes on businesses situated

within the Urban Council area, requires the approval of the Minister, but that

no such approval is required in respect of (a) taxes on bare lands, and (b) the

parking fee of Rs. 500 per annum on three wheelers.

A consideration of this ground requires this Court to examine the provisions in

the Urban Councils Ordinance that are applicable to the imposition of rates

and taxes for immovable property. There are three sections which are

important to this application, namely Sections 160(1), 162 and 165C(1) of the

Ordinance.

Section 160(1) reads as follows:

The Urban Council of a town may, subject to such limitations,

qualifications, and conditions as may be prescribed by the Council, and

subject to the approval of the Minister, impose and levy a rate on the

annual value of any immovable property or any species of immovable

property situated within the town.1

1 The word 'Minister' mentioned in the Urban Councils Ordinance No. 61 of 1939 refers to the Minister of Local Government. However, according to Section 2 (1) of the Provincial Council (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989, "Where any power or function is conferred on or assigned to a Minister or to a public officer, as the case may be, by any written law made prior to November 14, 1987 on any matter set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule, such power or function may, (a) if such power or function is conferred on, or assigned to, a Minister, be exercised or discharged, in relation to a Province and unless the context otherwise requires, by the Governor of that Province or the Minister of the Board of Ministers of that Province to whom the subject has been assigned; and accordingly, references in every such written law to a Minister shall be deemed to

7

Section 160(3) provides that, Where the Council, in imposing any rates for any

year, resolves to levy without alteration the same rate as was in force during

the preceding year, the approval of the Minister shall not be required for the

imposition and levy of such rate.

In terms of Section 166(1), the assessment of any immovable property for the

purpose of any rate under this Ordinance shall, with the necessary

modifications, be made in the manner prescribed by section 235 of the

Municipal Councils Ordinance, with respect to immovable property within

Municipal limits, and all the provisions of the said section, together with those

of sections 233, 242, 243, and 236 to 241, shall, with the necessary

modifications, apply with respect to every such assessment made for the

purposes of this Ordinance.

The above provisions can thus be summarized as follows:

a) The imposition and levying of rates by an Urban Council must be

approved by the Minister;

b) The approval of the Minister shall be required where there is to be an

increase in the quantum of rates;

c) The approval of the Minister shall not be required for the annual

imposition of rates if there is no increase from the previous year.

include reference to a Governor of a Province or the Minister of the Board of Ministers of such Province to whom the function has been assigned; ...... " Therefore, the term 'Minister' set out in the Urban Councils Ordinance No. 61 of 1939 as amended, read with the Provincial Council (Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989, in respect of the present application, refers to the Minister of Local Government of the Western Province.

8

It would be relevant to consider at this stage, the background relating to the

imposition of rates by the 2nd Respondent. According to X2, which is a

resolution moved by the Chairman of the 2nd Respondent at the Council

meeting held on 20th September 2018,2 the 2nd Respondent had been

established as an Urban Council on 15th April 2006.3 The 2nd Respondent had

levied rates on all properties situated within its area for the first time in 2007,

based on valuations obtained during the period 2000 2002.

The practice adopted by other Urban Councils had been to obtain fresh

valuations every five years, and thereafter amend the assessments issued to all

premises. Accordingly, the 2nd Respondent had initiated the process in 2007,

by first seeking the approval of the Minister. The first letter in this process is

the letter dated 4th July 2007, marked 2R1 sent by the 5th Respondent, the

Commissioner of Local Government, to the Secretary of the Chief Minister of

the Western Province, which reads as follows:

The approval of the Minister had been conveyed to the 5th Respondent, by the

Secretary of the Chief Minister, by letter dated 3rd September 2007, marked

2R2. The said letter reads as follows:

Even though 2R2 had been copied to the 2nd Respondent, the 5th Respondent,

too, by his letter dated 15th October 2007 marked 2R3 had conveyed the

approval of the Minister to the 2nd Respondent.

It appears that the 2nd Respondent did not take any steps on the above

approval until 2010, when the Council passed the following resolution, marked

2R4:

Even though approval of the Minister had already been obtained vide 2R2

in view of the above resolution to obtain a fresh valuation, the 2nd Respondent

had once again, by letter dated 20th August 2010, marked 2R5, sought fresh

approval of the Minister. The 5th Respondent, having obtained confirmation

that steps had not been taken on the approval granted by 2R24, had informed

the 2nd Respondent, by letter dated 3rd December 2010, marked 2R9, that

approval has already been granted by 2R2 to obtain a fresh valuation, and

that no further approval of the Minister is required.

The 2nd Respondent had thereafter requested the Chief Valuer to revise the

valuation in respect of 65653 premises situated within 17 wards of the 2nd

Respondent. However, owing to the marked increase in the number of

residents, the valuation process had taken several years, and the approval of

the Valuation Department had been given on a staggered basis in 2016 and

2017.5 As a result of this delay, the revision of rates that ought to have been

11

effected by the 2nd Respondent in 2010 in respect of premises situated within

the Urban Council limits of Kesbewa had not taken place.

It is relevant to note that all residential and commercial premises situated

within the Urban Council limits of Kesbewa had paid rates from the inception

of the 2nd Respondent until 2017 on valuations prepared in 2000-2002,

although it is common knowledge that there has been an increase in the values

of properties situated within the Urban Council limits of the 2nd Respondent.

Having received the aforementioned valuations, the 1st Respondent had taken

steps to issue notices of assessments on all residential and commercial

premises situated within the 2nd Respondent, including the Notice of

Assessment issued to the Petitioner, annexed to the petition marked P8. The

residential premises of the Petitioner, which is approximately 19 perches in

extent, and which had an annual value of Rs. 7,698/- based on the valuation in

2002 had been increased to Rs. 13020/ in 2018 based on the 2017 valuation.

The Petitioner who was paying a sum of Rs. 115.47 as rates per quarter in 2016

was required by P8 to pay a sum of Rs. 195.30 per quarter in 2018.

This Court has very carefully considered the contents of the aforementioned

letters, and especially 2R2 and 2R9, and is satisfied that the Minister has

granted approval to the 2nd Respondent to obtain a fresh valuation and

thereafter issue notices of assessment on all premises based on such

valuations. It is the view of this Court that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have

proceeded to issue P8 on the approval granted by the Minister. In these

circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the second ground urged

by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in respect of rates.

12

When this matter was mentioned on 9th October 2019, the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner informed this Court that as the 2nd Respondent was now

functioning with elected members, he would be satisfied if the imposition of

rates as evidenced by P8 is approved by the newly elected Council. The

learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents thereafter brought to the

attention of this Court, the following matters6:

a) By the resolution marked X2, the Chairman of the 2nd Respondent had

recommended that the rates for 2019, which is based on the valuation

given in 2017, be reduced;

b) The said resolution had been approved by the elected members of the 2nd

Respondent;

c) The Minister had however refused to approve the reduction of rates;7

d) At a meeting of the Council held on 8th November 2018, the elected

members of the 2nd Respondent had approved the imposition of rates for

2019 at the same rates imposed for 2018. The approval so granted has

been published in Gazette No. 2100 dated 30th November 2018.8

Thus, this Court is satisfied that the imposition of rates in respect of premises

situated within the 2nd Respondent for the year 2019 has been approved by

the 2nd Respondent.

6 Vide motion dated 6th December 2019. 7 Vide letter dated 2nd November 2018, annexed to the motion dated 6th December 2019 filed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents, marked X6. 8 Vide document marked X1 annexed to the motion dated 6th December 2019.

13

In its written submissions, the Petitioner has submitted that even if the revised

assessments were issued upon obtaining the necessary approvals, the 1st and

2nd Respondents have violated Section 235(3) and (4) of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance which require notices of assessment to be served on or left at the

premises of every occupier in a timely manner, thereby giving an occupier an

opportunity to voice any opposition to such assessment in terms of Section

235(4).9 This Court is of the view that even if the assessment P8 was served

late, there was no legal impediment to the Petitioner objecting to the notice of

assessment served on him. This Court must observe that according to X2,

over 500 residents out of the over 88100 assessments served in 2018, had in

fact objected to the assessments, and that the Petitioner too, could have done

so.

This Court shall now consider whether the 1st Respondent obtained the

approval of the Minister in respect of the taxes imposed by P4 P5 and P6.

The imposition of license fees and taxes, other than rates, is done in terms of

Section 162, which reads as follows:

1) The Urban Council of a town may, subject to such limitations,

qualifications, and conditions as may be prescribed by the Council,

impose and levy any of the following taxes and license duties within

the town;

a. a tax on vehicles and animals;

9 Section 166 of the Urban Councils Ordinance specifies that the assessment of any immovable property for the purpose of any rate under the said Ordinance shall, with the necessary modifications, be made in manner prescribed by section 235 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, with respect to immovable property within Municipal limits, and all the provisions of the said section, together with those of sections 233, 242, 243, and 236 to 241, shall, with the necessary modifications, apply with respect to every such assessment made for the purposes of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

14

b. a duty in respect of licenses issued by the Council; and

c. any other form of tax approved by the Minister.

(2) Where the Council, in imposing any tax under this section for any year,

resolves to levy without alteration the same tax as was in force during

the preceding year, the approval of the Minister shall not be required for

the imposition and levy of such tax.

The approval of the Minister is therefore required only if there is to be an

alteration of the tax from the previous year.10 Although the 1st and 2nd

Respondents have not submitted any documents to establish that the approval

of the Minister was obtained for the taxes imposed by P4, P5 and P6, this

Court observes that the Petitioner has not alleged that there has been an

increase of the said taxes from the previous year. Hence, this Court is not in a

position to conclude that the procedure laid down in the Ordinance has not

been followed in respect of P4, P5 and P6.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the

relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
