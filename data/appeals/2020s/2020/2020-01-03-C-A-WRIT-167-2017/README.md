Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on ih May 2019, the learned

-\' Counsel for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the

written submissions that have already been tendered on behalf of the parties.

There are two issues that arise for the determination of this Court in this

application. The first is whether the 1st Respondent, Sri Lanka Medical Council

(SLMC) acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it decided to proceed against

the Petitioners on the complaints made by the 8th - 14th Respondents. The

second issue is, in doing so, whether the SLMC acted in a procedurally

improper manner.

The Post Graduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) has been established by the

Post Graduate Institute of Medicine Ordinance No.1 of 1980 made under the

provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, as amended. The PGIM is the

body that conducts post graduate programmes of study in Medicine and

Surgery in Sri Lanka, including the MD programme in Family Medicine. A Board

of Study as well as a Board of Examiners has been established by the PGIM in

respect of each MD programme conducted by it.

The 8th - 14th Respondents are MBBS qualified Doctors who had enrolled for

the said MD programme in Family Medicine conducted by the PGIM, and who,

having successfully completed the training component of the said Programme,

had sat for the MD Family Medicine examination held in July 2013. The said

examination consisted of the following components:

4

Website Copy Website Copy

a) Portfolio of learning - 10 marks

b) Written examination - 20 marks

c) Clinical examination - 40 marks

d) Research dissertation and viva voce examination - 30 marks

The 1 st -Sth Petitioners are Board Certified Medical Specialists and Senior

Practitioners in Family Medicine. During the time the above examination was

conducted, the Petitioners had held the following positions in the Board of

Study and the Board of Examiners ofthe MD programme in Family Medicine:

Board of Study Board of Examiners

1 st Petitioner Chairman Member

2nd Petitioner Member Chief Examiner

3rd Petitioner Member Member

4th Petitioner Member Member

Sth Petitioner Member Member

The facts of this application revolve around three separate complaints made by

the 8th -14th Respondents relating to the manner in which the said

examination had been conducted, namely:

(a) The complaint made to the PGIM;

(b) Fundamental Rights Application No. 3S4/2013 filed in the Supreme Court; and

(c) The complaint made to the SLMC

5

The 8th -14th Respondents had sat for the said examination in July 2013

together with four others. Soon after the completion of the examination, the

said Respondents had complained to the PGIM about certain irregularities that

had taken place with regard to the manner in which the said examination had

been conducted. At a meeting of the Board of Management of the PGIM held

in August 2013, a decision had been taken to conduct an inquiry into the said

complaints. Accordingly, a Committee of Inquiry comprising of Professor

Malkanthi Chandrasekara, Professor M.D.Lamawansa and Mr. C. Maliyadda

had been appointed. The Committee, having recorded the statements of the

Petitioners as well as those who had complained, had submitted its report to

the Board of Management ofthe PGIM.

The summary of the findings and observations in respect of each component

of the examination as well as the conclusion and recommendations of the

Committee are re-produced below: i

"D. Summary of the findings and observations

Assessment of Portfolio of learning

There have been serious lapses in adhering to standard practice.

Examiners have not been appraved by the Board of Management. One

examiner who was not eligible to be even a trainer has been put as an

examiner at the last minute. He was given the portfolio only few minutes

before starting the examination. However most of the candidates have

passed this section of the examination.

1 A copy of the Report has been annexed to the Counter Affidavit in SC (FR) 354/2013, marked 'Pi G'.

[fJis is the component that had the highest,. number of failures. The

dispensing of the examination has been extremely poor. It is extremely

difficult to quantify the effect of this on the results. But there are several

reasons in the preceding paragraphs to believe that the effect was

substantial.

Dissertation of Viva

As the presentation of the first candidate was poor others have not been

requested to make presentations. This cannot be justified at all. The fact

that most candidates have passed this examination does not make the

practice adopted to justify the way the examination has been dispensed.

Alteration of marks

In Orlt1 of the candidates (number 9) marks have been alteied significantly

and the candidate is a batch mate of examiner/so

E. Conclusion

There had been substantial irregularities in administering three

components of the examination. Some of those may have resulted in low

pass rates while others may have contributed to artificially high pass rate.

F. Recommendations

Options

1. Assessment of Portfolio of learning

7

Website Copy Website Copy

(a) Approve the list of examiners retrospectively; or

(b) Hold a fresh examination

2. OSeE - Reschedule the examination for all the candidates.

3. Dissertation of Viva - No change is recommended."

The above report had been tabled at the meeting of the Board of Management

of the PGIM held in September 2013, where the following decisions had been

taken:

"The report of the Committee of inquiry appointed by the Board of

Management to investigate the concerns and irregularities raised by the

candidates of the above examination was tabled .. On the request of the

Board, the Chairperson of the Committee of Inquiry read the summary of

the findings, observations and conclusion of the report. The Chairman,

Board oj Management thanked the members of the Committee for the

submission of a comprehensive report to the Board of Management on

time.

Following a lengthy discussion it was decided to implement the following

immediately:

1. Cancel the unofficial results released following the results board.

2. To have another examination for the OSCE component.

3. To re-assess the portfolio viva.

4. To appoint 10 new examiners including retired persons (more than 65

years) from service to the OSCE/Portfolio components.

8

,

5. Appoint a new Chief Examiner for this examination.

It was also decided to call a special meeting of the Board of Study

immediately to convey the findings and conclusions of the report and the

decisions taken by the BOM on the matter.

The Chairman while appreciating the good work done by the Committee

of Inquiry requested the approval of the Board of Management to appoint

the same Committee to investigate the allegation of changing marks of

one candidate (Index Number 9, Dr. K.C.P. Perera) at the above

examination. Accordingly the BOM appointed the following members to

enquire into this allegation.

1. Professor Malkanthi Chandrasekara

2. Professor M 0 Lamawansa

3. Mr.C. Ma/iyadde".2

Although formal notice of the above decision of the Board of Management had

been given on 9th September 2013, the 8th -14th Respondents had filed

Fundamental Rights Application No. SC (FR) 354/2013 on 8th October 2013,

complaining of the manner in which the said examinations had been

conducted, and alleging that the respondents in that case, including the

Petitioners in the present application, have infringed their fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1) of the Constitution.

' The above decision has been produced with the affidavit of the Director of the PGIM, marked '3R21' filed in

SC (FR) 354/2013.

Apart from a declaration that the respondents have infringed the fundamental

rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g), the

petitioners had also sought a direction on the Board of Management of the

PGIM:

(a) to dissolve the existing Board of Study and to appoint a new Board of

Study excluding the members of the present Board of Study for the

rescheduled MD (Family Medicine) examination;3

(b) to appoint a new panel of examiners under a new Board of Study for the

rescheduled MD (Family Medicine) examination 2013.4

The Supreme Court had granted leave to proceed with the said application on

19th December 2013, and hearing had been fixed for 9th September 2014. This

Court must observe that what the petitioners were eventually seeking to

achieve through the said Fundamental Rights application was primarily to sit

for the examination under a new Board of Examiners and secondarily, under a

new Board of Study.

While the above fundamental rights application was pending before the

Supreme Court, each of the 8th -14th Respondents had made separate

complaints, by way of affidavits dated ih February 2014, to the Sri Lanka

Medical Council. The said complaints, marked 'P3AA' - 'P3AE' are identical in

content, and is re-produced below:

The 3'd and 5th Petitioners admit that they received letters dated 18th February

2014 annexed to the petition marked 'P3' and 'P3A' sent by the Acting

Registrar of the SLMC, requesting the Petitioners to submit their explanation

to the above complaint marked 'P3AA' and 'P3AB'. The Petitioners had also

been informed that in terms of the Regulations with regard to Disciplinary

Procedure, the President of the SLMC had decided to refer the said complaints

for inquiry to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee (PPC). The 4th -ih

Respondents were the members of the Preliminary Proceedings Committee of

the SLMC at the time the said complaints 'P3AA' and 'P3AB' were received by

the SLMC.

13

Website Copy Website Copy

In response to 'P3', the Petitioners, by a letter dated 1st March 2014, annexed

to the petition marked 'P4', informed the SLMC as follows:

"We wish to submit that the said doctors have taken up the same issue to

the Supreme Court of the country and annex herewith a copy of the

petition filed by them for your information.

You will undoubtedly observe that the issue raised in the alleged

complaint had been more specifically set out in their petition and they

have sought a determination in that regard from the Supreme Court.

Therefore, we would urge you that any step to proceed regarding the

alleged complaint made by the complainant doctors be done upon the

conclusion of the Supreme Court case ... "

It appears that the SLMC had sent a reminder to the Petitioners seeking a

response to 'P3', for the reason that by letter dated 3'd July 2014 annexed to

the petiti~n marked 'P4A', the 2nd -5th Petitioners had informed the SLMC

that, 'The position of the Supreme Court case is that it would meet on th July

2014 to consider a settlement. In these circumstances, as stated in our previous

letter, we will revert to you upon the conclusion of the Supreme Court case:

The entire set of the journal entries of the said Fundamental Rights Application

have been annexed to the petition marked 'PI'. This Court, having perused 'PI'

observes that the journal entry of ih July 2014 reads as follows: 'This matter is

settled and (is) not (to) be called hereafter (See the signed order for details):

The case had again been taken up on ih October 2014 and the journal entry

states that, 'Proceedings are terminated (see the order for details)'

14

Website Copy Website Copy

The Order dated t

h October 2014 has been annexed to the petition marked

'P2' and reads as follows:

"We have heard Counsel for the Parties when this matter was taken up for

support on 6th June 2014.

This Court having taken the view that this was a matter that was

eminently suitable for settlement, encouraged the parties to enter

settlement as suggested by the Court. The Court also directed that the

Settlement Terms will be pronounced by way of an Order on 9th June 2014.

This Court, however, observes that the Terms of Settlement as directed

had not been incorporated in the record although the Journal Eniry makes

reference to the matter being settled and consequently terminated.

This Court, therefore, reiterates its Order which is in the following terms.

1. The 1st to th Petitioners5 and the 21th to 219th Respondents6 shall

repeat the two components-

a) Portfolio Viva; and

b) Clinical Examination (OSCE) of the examination held on 20th May

2013 and 16th July 2013, respectively.

2. The examination will be conducted by the new panel of Examiners

and the new Chief Examiner already appointed by the Senate in

January 2014. It must be noted that if there is any member of the

15

Website Copy Website Copy

panel who has reviewed any results of the examination held in 2013,

such member shall not participate as an Examiner but a suitable

substitute be appointed as Examiner.

3. . The Senate will take steps as recommended by the Board of

Management to fill the existing vacancies in the Board of Studies

subject to the condition that the 40th to the 49th Respondents7 shall

be retained as members of the Board of Study until their terms of '

office ends.

4. The results of the Petitioners who were unsuccessful in-

a) The written examination

b) Dissertation Viva of the Examination held in 2013 shall be

reviewed by the new panel of Examiners.

The Petitioners have agreed to be bound by the decision of the new

panel of Examiners.

5. The Members of the Board of Study and the panel of Examiners must

ensure that they are impartial in the conduct of the said examination.

6. The 21th to the 218th and 219th Respondents undertake to withdraw

Case No. 171/2013/DSP in the District Court of Colombo.

7. The District Judge of Colombo is directed to dismiss the said actions

upon the withdrawal of Case No. 171/2013/DSP.

7 The Petitioners of this application were among the 40th -49th Respondents in the Fundamental Rights Application.

16

Website Copy Website Copy

We reiterate our Order thot these proceedings are terminated subject to

the aforementioned Terms."

This Court, having examined the above terms of settlement observes that it

essentially relates to the manner in which the examination must be re-

conducted, and especially the fact that the examiners must be impartial.

Accordingly, all candidates were required to repeat the Portfolio of learning

component and the Clinical component of the examination under a new panel

of Examiners headed by the Chief Examiner already appointed by the Senate of

the University of Colombo in January 2014. The Terms of Settlement also

dictated that if there is any member of the panel of examiners who has

reviewed any results of the examination held in 2013, that such members shall

not participate as examiners in the repeat examination in order to ensure

impartiality. This meant that the Petitioners would not examine the 8th -14th

Respondents in the fresh examinations that was to be conducted, which is part

of the relief sought in paragraphs (f) and (g) of the prayer to the petition in the

said Fundamental Rights application.

In the said terms of settlement, the 8th -14th Respondents had agreed to the

existing members of the Board of Study including the Petitioners continuing as

members of the Board of Study until their term of office came to an end. Thus,

the relief sought by the 8th -14th Respondents in their Fundamental Rights

application, to dissolve the Board of Study and replace the Members of the

Board of Study has been abandoned in the above Terms of Settlement.

The grievance of the Petitioners that is presently before this Court commences

at this point of time. The Petitioners state that notwithstanding the

17

Website Copy Website Copy

abovementioned 'Order' of the Supreme Court, the Petitioners received yet

another letter dated 11th November 2014 annexed to the petition marked 'P6',

requesting them to submit their explanation on the aforementioned

complaints made against them by the 8th _14th Respondents.

Bya letter dated 14th November 2014 annexed to the petition marked 'PS', the

Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioners had informed the SLMC that the Supreme

Court had vindicated the Petitioners of the complaints made against them, by

granting them authority to remain as members of the Board of Study until the

end of their term and that "it would not be proper or oppropriate for the SLMC

to embark upon a further inquiry into the same allegations, as the matter is

now effectively res judicata, and resolved." The Petitioners had also sent a

letter dated 23'd November 2014 to the Acting Registrar of the SLMC,

reiterating the contents of 'PS'.

The SLMC had replied 'PS' by letter dated 25th November 2014, marked 'P8S'

informing the Petitioners that the Preliminary Proceedings Committee and the

Professional Conduct Committee (PCe) are empowered to conduct inquiries

independently and that their failure to submit explanations would result in an

inquiry being held without their explanations being considered.

It would perhaps be useful to lay down briefly the procedure adopted by the

SLMC when complaints relating to disciplinary issues are made to it. The

Medical Disciplinary (Procedure) Regulations 1990, containing the disciplinary

procedure of the SLMC have been published in Gazette Extraordinary No.

757/07 dated 10th March 1993. A copy thereof has been annexed to the

petition marked 'P7'.

18

Website Copy Website Copy

In terms of 'P7', when a complaint is made to the S~MC against any medical

practitioner, which alleges any fact or matter constituting a ground on which

the SLMC is empowered to take action under Section 2S(1)(a) of the Medical

Ordinance, the President of the SLMC (the President) shall direct the Registrar

of the SLMC (the Registrar) to refer the said complaint or report to the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee for consideration, and report whether

there is a case which should be referred to the Professional Conduct

Committees.

When a complaint is referred to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, the

President is required to direct the Registrar to notify the practitioner of the

receipt of the complaint or report stating the matters contained therein and

request the practitioner to submit to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee,

any explanation that the practitioner may have to offer in respect of such

facts.9 It is in terms of this Regulation that the SLMC, by letters marked 'P3A'

and 'P6' requested the Petitioners to submit their explanations.

Regulation 5 of the said Regulations contains the powers of the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee in obtaining evidence and summoning witnesses for

the purpose of the inquiry. The Regulations stipulate that the inquiry and the

evidence shall be led in camera.10

Upon conclusion of the said inquiry, the Preliminary Proceedings Committee is

required to prepare and transmit to the Professional Conduct Committee, a

' Regulation 2(1). , Regulation 4.

IORegulation 9.

19

Website Copy Website Copy

report embodying its findings on each of the facts or matters alleged in the

complaint or report, together with a copy of such complaint or report.ll

Thereafter, the Professional Conduct Committee shall consider the report of

the Preliminary Proceedings Committee and shall determine whether or not an

inquiry should be held into the facts or matters alleged in the complaint or

report. 12 When the Professional Conduct Committee determines that no

inquiry should be held, the Professional Conduct Committee shall direct the

Registrar to notify the practitioner/s concerned of their decision. Where

however the Professional Conduct Committee determines that an inquiry

should be held into all or any of the matters contained in the report of the

Committee, the Registrar shall instruct that a notice of inquiry specifying the

charge or charges against the practitioner be issued to the practitioner. Part II

of the said Regulations contain detailed provisions with regard to the

procedure that should be followed by the Professional Conduct Committee,

including the right of representation by an Attorney-at-Law and the

opportunity of leading oral evidence.

This Court is of the view that according to the above provisions, the role of the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee seems to be to conduct a fact-finding

inquiry to assist the Professional Conduct Committee to ascertain whether

there is sufficient material to charge the practitioners concerned.

The Petitioners had provided their explanations to the SLMC by letters

annexed to the petition marked 'P10', 'P10A', 'P10B', 'P10C' and 'PlOD'. After

acknowledging the receipt of the said letters, the SLMC, by letter dated 22

nd

" Regulation 10. " Regulation 12(1).

20

Website Copy Website Copy

,

May 2015 marked 'P11', requested the Petitioners to appear before the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee on 5th June 2015 in order to "assist the

Committee in its inquiry into the above-mentioned complaints."

The Petitioners state that they duly attended and participated in the said

inquiry and had given evidence on a number of days. After the conclusion of

the Inquiry, but prior to the submission of the report of the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee, the Petitioners filed this application on 16th May 2017

seeking inter alia the following relief from this Court:

"(d) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the entire proceedings conducted before the

4th - 7th Respondents;

(e) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the purported decision of the 1st and/or 2nd

and/or 3,d Respondenr3 and/or anyone or more of them, to refer the

complaints produced marked P3AA - P3AE for inquiry before the 4th _1h

Respondents;

{f} A Writ of Certiorari to quash any purported decisions and/or findings

and/or report by the 4th - 1h Respondents against the Petitioners, if any,

including any purported decision to refer the subject matter of the said

inquiry to the Professional Conduct Committee of the SLMC;

(g) A Writ of Certiorari to quash any consequential or ancillary decisions by

the 1st - 3,d Respondents against the Petitioners, if any, including any

)

purported decision to refer the subject matter of the said inquiry to the

Professional Conduct Committee of the SLMC;

(hj A Writ of Certiorari to quash all consequential decisions taken by the 1st -

7h Respondents and/or anyone or more of them and/or their servants

and agents, in pursuance of any inquiry report containing any findings

against the Petitioners, compiled in relation to the said inquiry;

(ij A Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st _th Respondents and/or anyone

or more of them and/or their servants and agents fram further inquiring

into the purported complaints produced marked 'P-3AA to P3AE', and/or

taking any further steps consequent to the inquiry before the 4 th - t h

Respondents;

(j) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st _th Respondents and/or anyone

or more and/or their servants and agents from transmitting any report

containing any findings against the Petitioners, compiled in pursuance of

the said inquiry, to anyone, including the Professional Conduct

Committee of the SLMC;

(kj A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3,d Respondents

to issue Certificates of Good Standing to all Petitioners, indicating that

there are no adverse findings against the Petitioners as of date."

At the outset, this Court must observe that the Petitioners have failed to

produce before this Court any document containing the decision of the 4th - i h

Respondents, although relief has been sought on the assumption that there is

22

Website Copy Website Copy

,

in fact a decision. In Weerasooriya v. The Chairman. National Housing

Dev.elopment Authority and Others14 this Court has held that court will not set

aside a document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express

language in the prayer to the petition. It was the (losition of the 1st - t h

Respondents that the 4th - t h Respondents have not communicated their

decision to the 1st Respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any document

evidencing the decision of the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, this Court

cannot consider the reliefs sought in paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) of the prayer to

the petition.

The first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners is that the SLMC

and its President acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it referred the

complaint of the 8th -14th Respondents to the Preliminary Proceedings

Committee, and thereafter exceeded its jurisdiction by conducting an inquiry

against the Petitioners. The Petitioners state that the complaints filed by the

8th -14th Respondents to the SLMC and inquired into by the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee are identical, or if not, lesser in degree to the

complaints made before the Supreme Court. It is the contention of the

Petitioners that their Lordships of the Supreme Court completely exonerated

the Petitioners of the alleged complaints of the 8th -14th Respondents by

permitting the Petitioners to remain on the Board of Study until the end of

their term. This is specifically due to the fact that the Supreme Court did not

petition in the fundamental rights application. In other words, it is the position

of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the subject matter of the

complaint referred to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee are now res

judicata due to the fact that the said matters were already considered and the

proceedings terminated by the Supreme Court in SC (FR) Application No.

354/2013.

This Court, in the case of Lanka Maritime Services Ltd v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority and six Others17 has summarized the doctrine of Res Judicata as

follows:

"It is trite law that the dactrine of res judicata precludes fresh proceedings

only where there is a previous judicial decision on the same cause

between the same parties. It is cammon ground that there is no prior

judicial pronouncement to thwart the application made by the Petitioner

in this case. The question for determination on the preliminary objection

taken on behalf of some of the Respondents is whether the wider maxim

"interest reipublicaeut sit finis litium" which when canverted to

contemporary language means that "it is in the public interest that there

should be an end to litigation" would preclude the .Petitioner from

maintaining the present application. The said maxim was considered in

the old case of Men dis v Himmappooa18 in which the record revealed that

the plaintiff has twice already brought the identical action, and has twice

been absent on the date of the trial, and the case has been twice

dismissed. Stark J considered the maxim and observed:

a new panel of examiners under a new Board of Study for the rescheduled MD (Family Medicine) examination.

. " 'interest reipublicoeut sit finis litium' is a good maxim; it flows out

of the very nature of society, for unless there is an end to litigation,

rights would forever remain uncertain and no man would ever enjoy

that security of person and property, without some degree of which

society could not subsist, and it may be added, in proportion to the

enjoyment of which in any society civilization advances, or has

opportunity to advance."

Accordingly, it is a rule of law that a solemn judgment on any matter

standing pro veritate accipitur. 19 But this effect cannot attach to a

judgment given without a hearing of the case, which appears to be

the predicament in which the subject-matter of the present suit is

placed. If the judgments in the previous cases were in respect of the

absence of the plaintiff, and so of the nature of non-suits without

evidence taken in the cause, they do not amount to Res Judicata

which is properly defined as legal judgment on the same point

between the same parties, on the same grounds or media concluded

after argument or confession. "

It will follow . from this decision that where there is no prior judicial

pronouncement (including a withdrawal without reservation of the right

to initiate fresh proceedings) in a case involving the same parties and the

same cause, a Court will not dismiss any fresh action or application in

limine, and will entertain the subsequent action or application."

" A thing adjudged must be taken for truth.

Prior to considering the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners,

this Court wishes to make an important observation. That is, the SLMC was not

a party to the aforementioned Fundamental Rights application, and therefore

the SLMC was not a party to the settlement that the parties to that application

reached between themselves, which has been recorded as reflected by 'P2'.

Thus, on the face of it, the SLMC is not bound by the terms of settlement that

the parties reached before the Supreme Court.

The Petitioners state further that as no new complaints have been made to the

SLMC against the Petitioners after the conclusion of the Supreme Court case,

the SLMC could not have referred the complaint 'P3AA' to the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee and/or the Preliminary Proceedings Committee could

not have held an inquiry against the Petitioners on the same issues that were

agitated before the Supreme Court.

This Court observes that while in terms of Regulation 2(1) the President can

direct the Registrar to refer any complaint to the Preliminary Proceedings

Committee, in terms of Regulation 2(2), the President has the discretion to

refer the complaint to the Council itself (Le. the Sri Lanka Medical Council) as

opposed to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee.2o

20 Vide Regulation 2(2) of 'P7' which reads as follows: "Where any complaint or report relates to the conduct or negligence or incapacity relating to professional duties of a practitioner and it does not appear to the President that such conduct constitutes infamous conduct in any professional respect, or, that such negligence or incapacity constitutes negligence or incapacity relating to professional duties by reason of which the practitioner cannot be allowed to continue to practice as a practitioner or where any complaint or report relates to the conviction of a practitioner by a Court of law and it does not appear to the President that the offence of which the practitioner is alleged to have been convicted shows him to be unfit to practice as a practitioner, then, the President may instead of referring such complaint or report to the committee, direct the Registrar to place such complaint or report before the Council at its next meeting for consideration."

It is the contention of the Petitioners that the President should not have

referred the complaints to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee in view of

the resolution of the dispute in the Supreme Court and should have instead

directed the Registrar to place such complaint or report before the Council.

The Petitioners have sought a Writ of Certiorari against the said decision of the

President to refer the matter to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee.

As observed earlier, it is the contention of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners that the subject matter agitated before the Supreme Court is

identical to the complaints which formed the subject matter of the inquiry

before the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. This Court, having examined

the proceedings of SC (FR) Application No. 354/2013 and the Order containing

the Terms of Settlement 'P2', observes that the crux of the complaint before

the Supreme Court was fundamentally different to the purpose of the inquiry

before the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. Although the Fundamental

Rights application contained similar allegations of malpractice concerning the

Petitioners, the purpose of the application was to obtain an opportunity to be

adjudicated fairly and impartially at the MD in Family Medicine final

examination. In contrast, the objective of the inquiry before the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee was to trigger a process by which the SLMC could

ascertain if the Petitioners have upheld the disciplinary standards required of

them, as members of the medical profession.

This is buttressed by the fact that the 'Order' 'P2' is only an 'Order' containing

the Terms of Settlement and that it contains nothing on the culpability or

innocence of the Petitioners with regard to the allegations levelled against

them. The Petitioners are relying on paragraph 3 of the Order, by which the

27

Website Copy Website Copy

J

,

Supreme Court permitted the Petitioners to remain on the Board of Study till

the end of their term, as proof that the Supreme Court has exonerated the

Petitioners of all allegations levelled against them. This Court is of the view

that the said paragraph does not exonerate the Petitioners from the

allegations of malpractice and bias with regard to conducting the said

examination, which complaints were made against the Petitioners in their

capacity as members of the Board of Examiners, and not in their capacity as

members of the Board of Study.

At the time the terms of settlement were agreed upon, the Petitioners were

aware that the 8th - 14th Respondents had made a complaint to the SLMC.

However, the 'Order' 'P2', contains no mention of any agreement reached

between the parties on the complaints made against. the Petitioners to the

SLMC. This is in spite of the fact that 'P2' makes specific reference to the

District Court case bearing No. 171/2013/DSP, and the undertaking by the

21ih - 218th and 219th Respondents to withdraw the said cases.

This Court is of the view that if the Supreme Court intended that the

complaints against the Petitioners should not be considered and/or proceeded

with by the SLMC, such a direction would have formed part of the terms of

settlement 'P2'. The Petitioners were admittedly well aware of the complaints

made against them before the SLMC at the time the terms of settlement were

entered, but have chosen to leave the said complaints out of the terms of

settlement.

Therefore, in the absence of any undertaking by the 8th - 14th Respondents to

withdraw the complaint made against the Petitioners, and in the absence of an

28

I;

averment in the terms of settlement that the allegations against the

Petitioners have been withdrawn, this Court is of the view that the power of

the SLMC to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioners has not

. been fettered or restric~ed . In the above circumstances, it is the view of this

Court that the aforementioned terms of settlement is not a legal impediment

to the SLMC initiating and proceeding with the inquiry against the Petitioners.

Where the President of the SLMC is satisfied that the matter relates to

infamous conduct in any professional respect or negligence relating to

conducting professional duties, and in the absence of any resolution of the

dispute betwe!'!n the parties, the President is required to forward the matter

to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. This Court, having taken the view

that the terms of settlement 'P2' is not a bar to the SLMC proceeding with the

complaint against the Petitioners, is only concerned whether the President of

the SLMC took into account relevant factors when exercising his discretion in

referring the complaints to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. It appears

to this Court that the complaints made against the Petitioners were in fact in

relation to misconduct, as borne out by the report of the Committee appointed

by the PGIM, and in the absence of any substantial reasons to demonstrate

that the President of the SLMC made an irrational decision in referring the

complaints to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, this Court sees no basis

to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision of the President of the

SLMC, to refer the complaints to the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. This

Court must however state that these findings are made only for the purposes

of this application, and that the SLMC, as well as the Preliminary Proceedings

Committee and, if applicable, the Professional Conduct Committee, shall arrive

at its own findings, independent of the findings of this Court.

29

,

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the SLMC, its

President and the Preliminary Proceedings Committee did not exceed their

jurisdiction when it decided to proceed with the complaints made by the 8th -

14th Respondents against the Petitioners.

The second issue that arises for the consideration of this Court is whether the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee has conducted the said inquiry in violation

of the principles of natural justice, or in a procedurally improper manner, with

the Petitioners alleging that 'the inquiry was an artifice which was designed to

bring disrepute to the Petitioners', and that 'it was conducted in a manner that

was hostile to the Petitioners, and maintained no standards of decorum.' 21

This Court has examined the petition in order to ascertain the precise

complaint of the Petitioners in this regard and observes that the said allegation

is twofold. The first is the refusal by the SLMC to provide the Petitioners with a

copy of the proceedings before the Preliminary Proceedings Committee. The

second is that the members of the Preliminary Proceedings Committee,

namely the 4 th - t h Respondents were biased towards the Petitioners and was

actuated with malice.

There is one matter that this Court would like to address at the outset that

would negate the above complaints of the Petitioners. That is the fact that the

proceedings before the Preliminary Proceedings Committee is only a fact

finding exercise. In the event a report containing findings adverse to the

Petitioners are made, that would only enable the Professional Conduct

"Vide paragraph 47 of the petition and page 6 of the written submissions of the Petitioners dated 20'h September 2018.

30

Committee to initiate a formal inquiry against the Petitioners. In such a

situation, the above two complaints of the Petitioners would be rendered

nugatory as the Petitioner would be entitled to a fresh hearing before a

Committee consisting of persons other than the 4th - ih Respondents. As

observed earlier, an inquiry by the Professional Conduct Committee would

require a charge sheet to be served on the Petitioners, an opportunity being

afforded to the Petitioners to defend the said charges, and the entitlement on

the part of the Petitioners to be represented by an Attorney-at-Law. Therefore,

even if the above allegations are true, no prejudice has been caused to the

Petitioners.

Prior to considering the above two grounds however, and in order to place in

context the above two grounds urged by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners, this Court would like to advert to the submission of the learned

Counsel for the 1st - 6th Respondents that the Petitioners are guilty of laches, in

that this application has been filed only on 16th May 2017 whereas (a) the

decision to refer the complaint of the 8th - 14th Respondents to the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee was taken in 2014, (b) the proceedings before the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee were concluded in August 2015, and (c)

the two allegations complained of took place during the period of the inquiry.

This Court must state that there is much merit in this submission, and in the

absence of a plausible explanation for the delay in invoking the jurisdiction of

this Court, this entire application is liable to be dismissed due to delay.

The Superior Courts of this country have consistently held that a petitioner

seeking a discretionary remedy such as a Writ of Certiorari must do so without

delay, and where a petitioner is guilty of delay, such delay must be explained

31

to the satisfaction of Court. In other words, unexplained delay acts as a bar in

obtaining relief in discretionary remedies, ~ u ch as Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus. While this Court expects parties to seek relief from Court as soon

as it may reasonably be possible, a delay, if any, should be due to reasons

beyond the control of the party seeking relief. A party cannot 'sit' on his

entitlement to seek relief and thereafter belatedly make an application to

Court seeking relief, the granting of which is at the discretion of Court.22

The submission of the learned Counsel for the 1 st - 6th Respondents regarding

laches becomes important when one considers the factual circumstances

relating to the above' two grounds urged by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners. Following the conclusion of the inquiry, the Petitioners had

requested by letter dated 1 st August 2015 marked 'P14', that a complete and

unabridged copy of the written proceedings of the said inquiry be made

available to them. The Petitioners state that there were audio recordings of

the entire proceedings and had requested a copy of the same in the said letter.

The Attorney at Law for the Petitioners had stated that "access to an accurate

and complete record oj the proceedings in a judicial or quasi-judicial inquiry is

the inalienable right oj persons being subjected to such inquiry, and is an

essential requirement in terms oj the rules oj natural justice."

The Assistant Registrar of the SLMC declined the said request through letter

dated 14th August 2015 marked 'P1S'. It appears from 'P1S' that the

Preliminary Proceedings Committee has in fact sent a report to the

Professional Conduct Committee on the conclusions reached at the said

22 Vide Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis [(1982) 1 Sri LR 368; at pages 377 to 379 - Sharvananda, J (as he then was)]; followed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon Petroleum Corporation v. Kaluarachchi and others (SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019J.

J

inquiry. The Assistant Registrar of the SLMC had informed the Petitioners that

"the Professional Conduct Committee may fram.e charges against those who

are responsible for serious professional misconduct. Such proceedings will be

conducted by the Professional Conduct Committee and recorded verbatim and

reports of such proceedings can be obtained by the lawyer representing the

person against whom such charges are framed."

The Petitioners had made a further request dated 20th September 2016

marked 'PiS' for the said information to be released to the Petitioners under

the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016. The Petitioners state that to date,

there has been no response to the said request. The Respondents state that

the said request was made prior to the Right to Information Act coming into

force by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2004/66 dated 3rd February 2017 and that

there is no evidence to show that the Petitioners have attempted to obtain the

information through this avenue again. The Respondents state further that

releasing the proceedings to the parties before it is referred to the Professional

Conduct Committee is not contemplated by the Medical Disciplinary

(Procedure) Regulations 1990, 'P7'. The Respondents state that according to

Clause 12(1), the Preliminary Proceedings Committee is required to forward its

reports to the Professional Conduct Committee and that Clause 12(8) specifies

the documents that can be given or released to a party to an inquiry.23

While this Court takes the view that the SLMC could have made available

copies of the proceedings to the Petitioners, what is important to note in this

23 Regulation 12(8) reads as follows: "The Attorney-at-Law shall, on application made by a party to any inquiry and on payment of such fees as may be fixed in that behalf by the Council, send to such party copies of any affidavit, explanation or other statement or communication sent to the Council by the other party.1I

33

regard is that the reqLiest for the proceedings was made after the conclusion

of the. inquiry. Thus, the Petitioners cannot be heard to state for instance that

the non-availability of the proceedings affected their ability to present their

case before the Preliminary Proceedings Committee, and thus, this Court is of

the view that the Petitioners have not been prejudiced by such refusal. In any

event, by 14th August 2015, the Petitioners had been clearly informed by the

SLMC that they will not be provided with the proceedings, and therefore, this

Court is of the view that the Petitioners ought to have challenged that

decision, soon thereafter, which the Petitioners did not do. The Petitioners are

to blame for this delay, and must face the consequences for their laches. This

Court is accordingly of the view that the proceedings before the Preliminary

Proceedings Committee cannot be quashed on this ground.

The allegation that the 4th - ih Respondents were biased towards the

Petitioners and was actuated with malice has not been supported with any

specific accusations, nor have any findings of the said Respondents evidencing

such malice been placed before this Court. A litigant cannot expect this Court

to act on allegations made in thin air. If there was some merit in this allegation,

this Court would have expected the Petitioners to have complained

immediately to the SLMC, citing specific incidents or else invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court, as soon as may be possible, none of which has been

done. This Court is therefore of the view that there is no merit to the allegation

of the Petitioners that the 4th - i h Respondents were biased towards them, or

that the said Respondents were actuated by malice.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the

relief prayed for by the Petitioners. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
