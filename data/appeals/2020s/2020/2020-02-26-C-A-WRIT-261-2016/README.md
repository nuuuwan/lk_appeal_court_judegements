Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The four Petitioners filed this application seeking a writ of

certiorari to quash the decision contained in the Notice to Quit

marked P20 issued under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979, as amended. By this Notice to

Quit, the Director General of the Urban Development Authority

(UDA), as the competent authority under the Act, directed

Victory Silk Stores to deliver vacant possession of the land

described in the schedule to the Notice to Quit to the said

competent authority on or before 15.08.2016. Upon failure to

comply with this direction, proceedings have been instituted in

3

the Magistrates Court, but were put on hold pending

determination of the instant application.

At the argument, learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners

raised three points in challenging the Notice to Quit.

1. Failure to obtain the approval of the Minister in charge of

the UDA before issuance of the Notice to Quit, as required

by section 14(2)(b) of the Act

2. Failure to identify the land/property

3. The Notice to Quit being addressed in the name of the

partnership business

Regarding (1) above, the submission of learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General for the Respondents is that such a position had

not been taken up either in the petition or in the written

submissions and it was taken up for the first time at the

argument. This is correct. Although learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioners drew the attention of the Court to paragraph

10(E) of the petition, there is absolutely no reference either to

section 14(2)(b) of the Act or anything regarding the Notice to

Quit being issued without approval of the Minister. It is the

position of learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that had this

been taken up in the petition, he would have tendered in his

statement of objections proof regarding the Ministers approval.

I agree and reject the first ground raised on behalf of the

Petitioners.

The next argument relates to failure to identify the corpus.

According to the Notice to Quit P20, the property from which

eviction is sought is No.10/1 and 10/4 in Lot 1 of Plan No.

5623. A copy of this Plan P21 has been tendered by the

4

Petitioners to say that the 10/1 and 10/4 buildings are not

shown in the Plan. It is the submission of learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General that there is no legal requirement to

attach a Plan to the Notice to Quit, and what is necessary is

identification of the corpus. If the property can be identified, a

Plan can be disregarded. Senior Deputy Solicitor General

referred to several correspondences between the UDA and

Victory Silk Stores, where 10/1 and 10/4 of Dharmapala

Mawatha, Colombo 3 (which are admittedly the two buildings

from which eviction is sought) have been clearly identified. Even

the P6 sketchthe Petitioners own documentclearly identifies

10/1 and 10/4 of Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 3. The

District Court action previously filed by the Petitioners is also in

respect of 10/1 and 10/4 of Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 3.

Hence there is absolutely no question in identifying the property

without a Plan. In reply, learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners stated that what matters is not whether the property

from which eviction is sought can be identified but whether the

Quit Notice is valid in law.

This argument is purely technical and has nothing to do with

the merits of the application.

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was passed to

recover possession of State lands from persons in unauthorised

possession expeditiously. The procedure is simple and

straightforward. There is no place for high technical objections

which will defeat the purpose of the Act. Vide Gunaratne (Alexis

Auction Rooms) v. Abeysinghe (Urban Development Authority)

[1988] 1 Sri LR 255, Jayathilaka v Ratnayake [2007] 1 Sri LR

299, Ihalapathirana v. Bulankulame [1988] 1 Sri LR 416.

Let me further explain this point, as learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioners referred to the Court of Appeal Judgment of

Kandiah v. Abeykoon [1986] III CALR 141 in his submission to

say that Statutes which encroach on the rights of the subject

shall be strictly interpreted.

According to section 3(1)(b) of the Act, the Notice to Quit shall

specify the date on or before which the person in possession

shall vacate the land. It further states that the date to be

specified shall be not less than thirty days from the date of

issue.

In Gunaratne (Alexis Auction Rooms) v. Abeysinghe (Urban

Development Authority) (supra), the Supreme Court took the view

that although giving notice under that section is mandatory,

giving less than thirty days notice would not ipso facto vitiate

the Notice to Quit, if no prejudice is caused thereby.

Tambiah J. at pages 262-263 stated:

The object of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act,

No. 7 of 1979 is the speedy recovery of possession of State

lands from persons in unauthorised possession or

occupation. The object of giving notice is to tell the occupier

that he must vacate the land and hand over possession;

otherwise, the Competent Authority will resort to, the

speedy remedy provided for in the Act. The giving of notice

under s. 3(1) to vacate and hand over possession is a

mandatory requirement and must be complied with, and

that has been done in this case.

It seems to me that the stipulation of 30 days in s. 3 (1) has

been inserted for the benefit of the occupier. The Competent

6

Authority, at his discretion, may specify a date not less

than 30 days or a longer period, having regard to the type

of premises to be dealt with, e.g., if it is factory premises,

he might specify 90 days to enable the occupier to

dismantle the equipment and find an alternate site. The

notice that was given in this case was defective in form it

gave only 15 days to vacate. In the words of De Smith

breach of procedural or formal rules is likely to be treated

as a mere irregularity if no substantial prejudice has been

suggested by those for whose benefit the requirements

were introduced.

The notice to quit is dated 10.10.83. The application for

ejectment was filed on 24.1.84, i.e. the Petitioner had 106

days to move out before legal proceedings were instituted.

In addition, on Petitioners own request, the learned

Magistrate granted him a further 2 weeks for occupation.

Thus, no substantial prejudice has been caused to the

occupies for whose benefit the time requirement was

introduced. In my view, the requirement in s. 3(1) of Act, No.

7 of 1979, that a minimum of 30 days be given to vacate

must be treated as directory and there has been a

substantial compliance with the time requirement specified

in s. 3(1) of the Act.

There is no issue that the premises from which eviction is

sought is State land. During the course of the argument,

although there was an attempt to say that Victory Silk Stores

was the tenant under the UDA, there is no evidence at all to that

effect. According to P17a document tendered by the

Petitioners themselvesVictory Silk Stores pays a monthly usage

7

fee to the UDA. Learned Presidents Counsel submitted in

passing that monthly tenancy could have been created between

Victory Silk Stores and the UDA thereby.

There is no doubt that Victory Silk Stores did not pay rent but a

monthly usage fee for occupation. Even assuming without

conceding that Victory Silk Stores did pay rent to the UDA, mere

payment of rent does not create tenancy unless parties have

actually intended to do so. There shall be ad idem (meeting of

minds) as to the essential requirements: (1) that the object of the

contract is to let and hire; (2) ascertained property; (3) a fixed

rent. Vide Wille on Landlord and Tenant in South Africa, 2nd

Edition, page 2, Eileen Prins v. Marjorie Patternott [1995] BLR 41,

Jayawardena v. Bandaranayake [1998] 3 Sri LR 72 at 74-75,

Bastian v. Panagoda [1998] 3 Sri LR 173. No such agreement

has taken place in this case.

The business in the name of Victory Silk Stores is carried on in

No. 8 and 10, Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 7. The UDA does

not need the portion wherein the Petitioners engage in actual

business. No. 10/1 and 10/4 are located at the rear side of the

business whereas 10/1 is used as a garage and 10/4 as a

security point and storeroom. These seem to be additions to the

main building. The UDA at least since 2007 has been

requesting that Victory Silk Stores vacate premises No.10/1 and

10/4, but this request has not been complied with. Vide inter

alia P15, P15A, P15B, P15C, P15D.

I think this is a suitable point to refer to the District Court

action (7839/SPL) filed by the Petitioners as partners of Victory

Silk Stores when the UDA repeatedly demanded that they vacate

the premises 10/1 and 10/4. It is significant that the relief

8

prayed for by the Petitioners in the prayer to that plaint was an

order preventing the UDA from ejecting the Petitioners without a

Court Order. The District Court issued an interim injunction.

However the case was later laid by on the submission of the

State Counsel who stated that the UDA would take steps to

recover possession of the property under the Urban

Development Authority Act or State Lands Recovery of

Possession Act or any other Law.

The UDA took steps under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Therefore the submission of Presidents

Counsel that the UDA could only have taken steps under the

Urban Development Authority Act is unsustainable.

1 Vide pages 193-194 of P16.

9

Connected to the District Court case, another argument

mounted by Presidents Counsel was that the UDA ought to have

taken steps within a period of 12 months from the date of the

said Order. This argument is clearly misplaced. Although the

District Judge has not stated so in so many words, the 12-

month period mentioned in the District Judges Order refers to

section 402 of the Civil Procedure Code. According to this

section, if a period exceeding 12 months in the case of a District

Courtelapses subsequently to the date of the last entry of an

order or proceeding in the record without the plaintiff taking any

steps to prosecute the action where any such step is necessary,

the court may pass an order that the action shall abate. Under

section 403 of the Civil Procedure Code, when an action abates

the action dies a natural death once and for all. Learned

Presidents Counsel states that the action was abated. If this is

the case, there is no interim injunction in operation.

When there is no ambiguity in identifying the portion to be

evicted, the Notice to Quit need not be quashed on a mere

technicality which has caused no prejudice to the Petitioners.

In Seneviratne v. Urban Council, Kegalle [2001] 3 Sri LR 105 at

108, J.A.N. de Silva J. (later C.J) quoted with approval the

following passage of Judicial Review of Administrative Action by

De Smith (5th Edition, 1995), where it is stated that If the

applicant has not been prejudiced by the matters on which he

relies then the Court may refuse relief even though he has

succeeded in establishing some defect. The literal or technical

breach of an apparently mandatory provision in a Statute may be

so insignificant as not in effect to matter. In these circumstances

the Court may in its discretion refuse relief.

10

I reject the second argument of the Petitioner.

The third argument is in relation to the name of the party to be

ejected as described in the Notice to Quit. The party on whom

Notice to Quit was served is Victory Silk Stores. The Petitioners

to this application are the partners of that partnership business.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, drawing

attention to the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, argues that the words used are persons and

his dependents and therefore Notice shall be addressed to a

natural person. If this argument is to prevail, incorporated

bodies who can sue and be sued are also not covered. It is true

that a partnership is neither a natural nor a juristic person.

Nevertheless, section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance, No. 21

of 1901, as amended, states that person includes any body of

persons corporate or unincorporate. A partnership is an

unincorporated body. Hence there is no legal obstacle to serve a

Notice to Quit on the partnership. All the correspondence,

including payment receipts, which the Petitioners heavily rely

on, are in the name of the partnership and not in the name of

the partners. No prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners

thereby. When the UDA sent letters in the name of the

partnership, the Petitioners being the partners have readily

responded. The Petitioners have even responded to the

summons directed on the partnership and submitted to the

jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court. Vide Jayasinghe v.

Gnanawathie Menike [1997] 3 Sri LR 410, W.M. Mendis & Co. v.

Excise Commissioner [1999] 1 Sri LR 351.

I am not inclined to agree with the third submission as well.

11

Before I part with this Judgment, I must state that writ is a

discretionary remedy. It is an equitable relief. A party cannot

invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right. Even if a

party is technically entitled to the relief sought, the Court can

still refuse to grant the relief, if other factors stand against the

granting of that relief. The Court shall take stock of everything

including the conduct of the party applying for the writ and

decide what is best.

In Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne [1984] 1 Sri LR 83 at 90, the

Supreme Court observed:

It is necessary at this stage to bear in mind that certiorari is

a discretionary remedysee Wade: Administrative Law

5th Ed. (1982) pp. 546, 591. As de Smith says in his work

Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th Ed. (1980) p.

404: Thus, certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be

withheld if the conduct of the applicant, or, it would seem,

the nature of the error does not justify judicial intervention.

The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of

the case before it before issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ

of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will

be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.

Vide also Siriwardena v. Provincial Public Service Commission

[2012] BLR 373, Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Services Ratnapura [1996] 2 Sri LR 70, Edirisooriya v.

National Salaries and Carde Commission [2011] 2 Sri LR 221,

I dismiss the application of the Petitioners with costs.
