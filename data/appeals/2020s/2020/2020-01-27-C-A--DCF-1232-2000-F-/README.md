Janak De Silva, J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Galle dated 29.03.2000.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Plaintiff), by filing the plaint dated 25.06.1976 [Page 103 of

the Appeal Brief], instituted the abovestyled action in the District Court of Galle

seeking inter alia to partition the land called 'Danduwanowita Watta' and

'Gankanda Watta' containing about two pelas of paddy sowing extent (e; G'~OlC2Sl

o0~ Eloe.:l6~ ) situated at Nagoda. According to the plaint, the said land is bounded

on the North by Pelesse Watta, on the East by Hitiyange Ela, on the South by

Mahadanduwatte Owita and on the West by Main Road.

A commission was executed to survey the land to be partitioned. Lots q and qJ in

Plan No. 2651 dated 23.11.1976 made by A. R. Dias Abeygunawardena, Licensed

Surveyor [Page 150 of the Appeal Brief] containing in extent A.0-R.3-P.4.8 were

identified as the land to be partitioned. However, the Licensed Surveyor observed

that even though the boundaries of the said Lots q and qJ tally with the boundaries

Page 4 of 10

Website Copy Website Copy

of the land described in the plaint, there is a reduction in extent [Page 152 of the

Appeal Brief].

Initially, the action was against the 1st - 5th Defendants, who did not dispute the

pedigree produced by the Plaintiff. Pending trial, the 6th - 24th Defendants were

added. The 7th - 9th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 10.03.1978 [Page

109 of the Appeal Brief] but later amended it on 19.02.1982 [Page 123 of the Appeal

Brief] and disputed the extent of the land to be partitioned. The 10th Defendant

filed his Statement of Claim on 10.03.1978 [Page 116 of the Appeal Brief] and

produced an alternative pedigree.

The 7th - 9th Defendants executed another commission to identify and survey the

land to be partitioned. Accordingly, plan No. 1118 dated 07.09.1983 comprising of

Lots <t, <tJ, .:n and .:n (containing in extent A.2-R.3-P.31) was prepared by T. D.

Ramachandra, Licensed Surveyor [Page 156 of the Appeal Brief]. The 7th - 9th

Defendants filed their amended Statement of Claim dated 27.02.1991 [Page 134 of

the Appeal Brief] and sought to partition the entire land depicted in the said plan

No. 1118.

The 16th -19th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 19.09.1984 and sought

to exclude Lot <tJ in the said plan No. 1118 from the land to be partitioned on the

ground that it is a portion of a different land.

The 22nd Defendant filed her Statement of Claim on 08.02.1987 and accepted that

land to be partitioned is depicted as Lots <t, <tJ, .:n and 'tl in the said plan No. 1118.

However, she produced an alternative pedigree and claimed an undivided X share

of the entire land.

After a lengthy trial, the learned Additional District Judge dismissed the Plaint of

the Plaintiff for the reason that the land sought to be partitioned is not properly

identified. Being aggrieved, the Plaintiff appealed.

In a partition action, there is a duty cast on the Judge to satisfy him as to the identity

ofthe land sought to be partitioned [Jayasuriya v. Ubaid (61 N.L.R. 352)]. There are

certain duties cast on the Court quite apart from objections that mayor may not be

taken by the parties. In addition to the duty that is cast on the Court to resolve the

disputes that are set out by the parties in their issues, the Court has a supervening

duty to satisfy itself as to the identity of the corpus and also as to the title of each

and every party who claims title to it [Wickremaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera

(1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 190]. Without proper identification of the corpus it would be

impossible to conduct a proper investigation of title [Sopinona V. Pitipanaarachchi

(2010) 1 Sri.L.R. 87].

In Sopinona V. Pitipanaarachchi (Supra at 107) Saleem Marsoof, J. further observed

as follows -

"The identity of the corpus is also a matter of fundamental importance in

ensuring that all persons who have any claim to it to participate in the

partition action, which ultimately canfers title in rem."

According to the plaint, the Plaintiff sought to partition a land called

'Danduwanowita Watta' and 'Gankanda Watta' containing about two pelas of

paddy sowing extent (B ~~~lCz:l) ~~ t)~e"6,,, ), the boundaries of which are as

follows -

NORTH

EAST

SOUTH

WEST

by Pelesse Watta

by Hitiyange Ela

by Mahadanduwatte Owita

by Main Road

Two pelas of paddy sowing extent is roughly equivalent to about 11/4 acre.

According to the said Plan No. 2651, the land to be partitioned is A.0-R.3-P.4.8 in

extent and is bounded as follows-

NORTHEAST by Pelesse Watta

SOUTHEAST

SOUTHWEST

NORTHWEST

by Hitiyange Ela

by Mahadanduwatte Owita

by Main Road (from Nagoda to Ethumale)

As per the said Plan No. 1118, the land to be partitioned is A.2-R.3-P.31 in extent

and is bounded as follows-

NORTHEAST

SOUTHEAST

SOUTH

SOUTHWEST

NORTHWEST

by Pelesse Watta and Mahadanduwatte Owita

In the case of Ratnayake and Others v. Kumarihamy and Others [(2002) 1 SrLL.R.

65] Weerasuriya, J. (PICA) observed-

"The system of land measure computed according to the extent of land

required to sow with paddy or kurakkan vary due to the interaction of several

factors. The amount of seed required could vary according to the varying

degrees of the soil, the size and quality of the grain, and the peculiar qualities

of the sower. In the circumstances, it is difficult to correlate sowing extent

accurately by reference to surface areas." [emphasis added]

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that it is unwise to try to ascertain the

identity of the land to be partitioned depending merely on the extent of the land

where the extent is computed according to the extent of land required to sow with

paddy or kurakkan. Therefore, in this context it is essential to look into the evidence

and tally the boundaries in order to properly identify the land to be partitioned.

If the land to be partitioned is clearly described and can be precisely ascertained in

the said manner, then the inconsistency in extent will not affect the question of

identity [Gabriel Perera v. Agnes Perera (43 c.loW. 82), Yapa v. Dissanayake Sedara

(1989) 1 SrLloR. 361].

To establish his title, the Plaintiff produced Deed of Transfer No. 2687 dated

22.01.1961 attested by H. G. Hewavithana, Notary Public (011), Deed of Transfer

No. 2901 dated 23.12.1920 attested by B. K. M. R. W. Gunawardena, Notary Public

(012) and Deed of Transfer No. 2502 dated 06.10.1943 attested by W. M. D. A.

Wanigasooriya, Notary Public (013). In all three deeds, the land to be partitioned is

bounded as follows -

NORTH

EAST

SOUTH

WEST

by Pelesse Watta

by Hitiyange Ela

by Mahadanduwan Ow ita

by Gin Ganga

Here, it must be noted that the west boundary of '011', '012' and '013' and the west

boundary of the land described in the plaint differ.

According to the Schedule of the Deed of Transfer No. 5426 dated 10.11.1963

attested by H. G. Hewavithana, Notary Public (551), the boundaries of the land to

be partitioned are described as follows-

NORTH by Pelesse Watta

EAST

SOUTH

WEST

by Hitiyange Ela and Ganegodawatte Kanda

by Hitiyange Ela and Dikirawalla

by Gin Ganga

It can be observed that the south and west boundaries of '55 1' are different than

what is stated in the plaint.

To establish her title, the 19th Defendant produced Deed ofTransfer No. 3065 dated

27.11.1923 attested by D. A. Gunasekera, Notary Public (195 1), Deed of Transfer

No. 2416 dated 21.06.1922 attested by D. A. Gunasekera, Notary Public (1952) and

Deed of Transfer No. 2390 dated 23.03.1922 attested by D. A. Gunasekera, Notary

Public (1953).

In all three deeds, the land to be partitioned is bounded as follows-

NORTH by Kuda Danduwanowita and Watta

EAST by Hitiyange Ela

SOUTH

In Deed of Transfer No. 3864 dated 25.12.1960 attested by A. V. D. A. Ranaweera,

Notary Public (2051), Deeds of Transfer Nos. 388 (752), 389 (753) and 390 (754)

dated 23.09.1973 attested by C. K. W. Seneviratne, Notary Public, Deed ofTransfer

No. 836 dated 12.04.1976 attested by C. K. W. Seneviratne, Notary Public (755) and

Deed of Transfer No. 21223 dated 7.10.1909 attested by D. L. De Silva

Wickramanayake, Notary Public (756), the land to be partitioned is described in the

aforesaid manner.

According to Deed of Transfer No. 4895 dated 17.03.1963 attested by H. G.

Hewavithana, Notary Public (2151) and Deed of Transfer No. 4910 dated

24.03.1963 attested by H. G. Hewavithana, Notary Public (2152), the boundaries of

the land to be partitioned are as follows-

NORTH by Gin Ganga

EAST

SOUTH

WEST

by Pelessewatta and Main Road

by Punchi Danduwanowite Watta

by Gin Ganga and Punchi Danduwanowite Watta

As the learned Additional Judge very correctly observed, all the aforementioned

deeds recognize 'Gin Ganga' as the west boundary of the land called

'Danduwanowita Watta' and 'Gankanda Watta'. However, neither the plaint or plan

No. 2651 [Page 150 of the Appeal Brief] recognizes 'Gin Ganga' as anyone of the

boundaries of the land to be partitioned. Even it is certain that the west boundary

of the land described in the aforementioned deeds is indeed 'Gin Ganga', a careful

perusal of the said deeds reveals the other boundaries vary from deed to deed.

In these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of learned

Additional District Judge of Galle dated 29.03.2000. Appeal is dismissed with costs.
