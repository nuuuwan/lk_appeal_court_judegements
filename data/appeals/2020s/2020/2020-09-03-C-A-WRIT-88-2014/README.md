Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The land relevant to this application (a portion of Lot 964 of

Final Village Plan No.778 marked 2R1)1 was acquired by the 2nd

Respondent Mahaweli Authority2 under the Land Acquisition

Act, in order to alienate the land to the 1st Respondent National

Housing Development Authority for the Embilipitiya Gam Udawa

(Village Awakening) programme.3 As seen from P7A, the

acquisition took place prior to 14.09.1985. P7B/2R3 and

P8C/2R4, in particular, decisively prove a portion of land in

extent of 1 acre and 2 roods belonging to the Petitioners father

had been acquired in this process and, after an inquiry held

under the Land Acquisition Act, the Petitioners father was

awarded compensation for the said acquisition in a sum of Rs.

15,860.45 on 05.12.1991. Having been dissatisfied with the

award, the Petitioners father appealed to the Board of Review

within 21 days thereof but, admittedly, the Board of Review has

not given its decision up to now.

By P9 dated 28.06.2006, the Petitioners father requested the

Mahaweli Authority to divest the said land, which had hitherto

been unutilised for any public purpose. P9 was not replied.

Thereafter, the Petitioner learnt the National Housing

Development Authority, by newspaper advertisement marked

P10 dated 06.02.2007 read with P11, had called for applications

1 Vide paragraph 6 of the statement of objections of the 2nd Respondent, the Mahaweli Authority. 2 Vide paragraph 6 of the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent, the National Housing Development Authority. 3 Vide Tenement List marked 2R2 prepared in September 1984.

5

to sell portions of land, including the land in dispute, on

competitive prices for monetary gain.

The Petitioners father took prompt action against this move and

desperately wrote to various State agencies, including the

President of the Republic (P12A), the Human Rights Commission

(P12C), the Mahaweli Authority (P12E), and the Minister of

Lands (P12G), seeking divestiture of his portion of land which

had not been used for the intended public purpose. As seen

from P12B, P12D, P12F, P13A, P13B, P14, P15A, P15B, all these

agencies appear to have taken the view the request of the

Petitioners father was reasonable and ought to be fulfilled.

After an inquiry, the Human Rights Commission, by P12D dated

28.04.2010, recommended to the Mahaweli Authority and the

National Housing Development Authority that the land be

divested, as it was not utilised for the Embilipitiya Town

Development programme for which it had been acquired in

1986, or an alternative portion of land be offered to the

Petitioners father.

As seen from 1R1, after acquisition the land had been alienated

to the National Housing Development Authority by way of a

Grant dated 24.03.1986, issued under the State Lands

Ordinance. This was done, as seen from 2R2, to make the 1986

Embilipitiya Gam Udawa programme a success.4 According to

P12F sent by the Mahaweli Authority to the National Housing

Development Authority, this Grant was issued in order for the

latter to construct houses in Yodhagama, Embilipitiya (for the

4 Vide the 4th item from the top in 2R2.

6

Gam Udawa housing programme). The fact that the Grant was

issued for this purpose is also manifest by inter alia P10 and

P11, where the said land has been identified as a portion of the

land in the Embilipitiya Yodhagama Gam Udawa programme.

The National Housing Development Authority accepts this in

paragraph 9 of the statement of objections, when it says

although the Grant states the National Housing Development

Authority can utilise the land for any purpose set out in the

National Housing Development Authority Act, the land was used

for the purpose of the Embilipitiya Yodagama Village Awakening

programme.

By P12F, the Mahaweli Authority requested the National

Housing Development Authority to return 1 acre and 2 roods of

land not ulilised for the said purpose, in order for the Mahaweli

Authority to release the same to the Petitioners father.

P14 sent by the Mahaweli Authority to the National Housing

Development Authority, reveals that a joint field inspection was

carried out on 13.07.2011 with the participation of officers of the

Mahaweli Authority and the National Housing Development

Authority. On this inspection, it was found that of the land

given on the Grant, a portion of approximately 3 acres in extent

had not been utilised for the purpose for which it was given.

Hence the Mahaweli Authority requested the National Housing

Development Authority to release 1 acre and 2 roods of the

unutilised land to the Petitioner to put an end to this

longstanding matter. P14 has neither been replied nor fulfilled.

7

Following the complaints of the Petitioner and her father to the

President about this injustice, the Presidential Secretariat sent

several letters to the Mahaweli Authority and the National

Housing Development Authority, directing or advising them to

release a portion of land in favour of the Petitioner. The most

recent letter marked P15B dated 09.09.2013, signed by the

Secretary to the President himself, informs the Secretary to the

Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resource Management to

release the land to the heirs of the Petitioners deceased father.

All attempts by the Petitioners father and the Petitioner for

divestiture of the land having failed, the Petitioner filed this

application on 21.03.2014 to quash by certiorari the newspaper

advertisement marked P10 read with P11 for the sale of the

vacant portions of land covered by the Grant 1R1, and to compel

the Respondents by mandamus to divest 1 acre and 2 roods to

the Petitioner from the land still unutilised for any public

purpose.

Let me now consider the defences taken up by the Respondents

in their statements of objections in resisting the Petitioners

application.

The 3rd and 4th Respondents, the Divisional Secretary of

Embilipitiya and the Minister of Lands, have not taken up any

valid defence in their joint statement of objections, apart from

the standard objections found in all writ applications vide

paragraph 8 of the objections.

The 2nd Respondent Mahaweli Authority, in its statement of

objections, seeks dismissal of the Petitioners application

8

predominantly on the basis that as the appeal of the Petitioners

father to the Board of Review against the award of compensation

is pending, the Petitioner cannot maintain this application. I

have no hesitation in rejecting this objection, which is, in my

view, irresponsible, as nearly 30 years have passed since the

appeal was submitted and there is nothing on record to suggest

when, if ever, the decision of the Board of Review can be

expected.

In addition, the 2nd Respondent, by producing a letter marked

2R6, says the 1st Respondent National Housing Development

Authority has provided a reason for its inability to release the

said land to the Petitioner. I will deal with this letter later in this

Judgment.

It is common ground that after the acquisition of the land, it was

alienated to the 1st Respondent by way of a Grant. As I have

already stated, by paragraph 9 of the statement of objections,

the 1st Respondent, whilst admitting the land was used for the

purposes of Embilipitiya Yodagama Village Awakening

Programme (Gam Udawa), nevertheless says it was given to the

1st Respondent to ulilise the same for any purpose and/or matter

stipulated in the National Housing Development Authority Act.

The latter statement is, I believe, in defence of the advertisement

for sale, as reflected in P10 and P11, of portions of land not

utilised for the Gam Udawa programme.

By P7A the 2nd Respondent admits this land was acquired for

the development of the Embilipitiya town. Almost

simultaneously the land was given to the 1st Respondent by way

9

of a Grant, not to do as he pleases but to further the objective of

the acquisition of the land, even though the Grant does not

specify this in so many words. Hence, I reject the standpoint of

the 2nd Respondent that the 1st Respondent is free to sell the

remaining portions of land at competitive prices for monetary

gain. This is a betrayal of the Public Trust doctrine by State

agencies, which the Courts will never condone or tolerate.

In the case of Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika Kumaratunga,5

commonly known as The Waters Edge case, the land acquired

for a public purpose was sold to a private entrepreneur to set up

a golf resort. Quashing the latter transaction and declaring that

the Petitioners fundamental right to equality before the law

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution had been

violated, the Supreme Court observed at page 352:

The principle that those charged with upholding the

Constitution - be it a police officer of the lowest rank or the

President - are to do so in a way that does not violate the

Doctrine of Public Trust by state action/inaction is a basic

tenet of the Constitution which upholds the legitimacy of

Government and the Sovereignty of the People. The Public

Trust Doctrine is based on the concept that the powers held

by organs of government are, in fact, powers that originate

with the People, and are entrusted to the Legislature, the

Executive and the Judiciary only as a means of exercising

governance and with the sole objective that such powers

will be exercised in good faith for the benefit of the People of

Sri Lanka. Public power is not for personal gain or favour,

5 [2008] 2 Sri LR 339.

10

but always to be used to optimize the benefit of the People.

To do otherwise would be to betray the trust reposed by the

People within whom, in terms of the Constitution, the

Sovereignty reposes. Power exercised contrary to the Public

Trust Doctrine would be an abuse of such power and in

contravention of the Rule of Law. This Court has long

recognized and applied the Public Trust Doctrine,

establishing that the exercise of such powers is subject to

judicial review. (Vide De Silva v. Atukorale [1993] 1 Sri LR

283 at 296-297; Jayawardene v. Wijayatilake [2001] 1 Sri

LR 132 at 149, 159)

By paragraph 10 of the statement of objections, the 1st

Respondent admits having advertised the unutilised land for

sale. The 1st Respondent further admits in the same paragraph

that only one lot (No.4 of Plan No.598) has been sold to a buyer

up to date and the remainder of the allotments are still with the

1st Respondent.

By paragraph 11 of the said objections, the 1st Respondent says,

upon receipt of the Human Rights Commission report requiring

the 1st Respondent to release the portion of land formerly

belonging to the Petitioners father or offer alternative land to the

Petitioners father, a joint site inspection was carried out by the

1st and 2nd Respondents to ascertain whether there were any

vacant portions of land, but the same could not be found. The

1st Respondent has tendered 1R5 dated 16.03.2011 (which was

tendered by the 2nd Respondent as 2R6) to explain why the

Petitioners request cannot be allowed. The reason given in

1R5/2R6 is it was revealed from the joint inspection that a

11

portion of land allocated for the construction of houses and a

playground by the 1st Respondent is included in the land

identified to be released to the Petitioner.

It is my considered view this reason is plainly unacceptable, as it

is not supported by even a scrap of documentary evidence.

There is no evidence of a decision taken to construct houses and

a playground. At the very least, there is not even a Plan

prepared for this purpose.

Furthermore, the reason contained in 1R5 dated 16.03.2011 is

in conflict with the newspaper advertisement P10 and P11 dated

06.02.2007, by which the 1st Respondent decided to sell the

vacant portions of land at competitive prices. It was never the

position of the 1st Respondent that the intended sale was in

respect of vacant portions of land excluding the land purportedly

reserved for the construction of houses and a playground.

It is also significant to note that in paragraph 11 of the

statement of objections, the 1st Respondent speaks of a joint

inspection carried out prior to 1R5 dated 16.03.2011. But, as

seen from P14 dated 05.09.2012, a letter sent by the Director

General of the 2nd Respondent to the Chairman of the 1st

Respondent, another joint inspection had been carried out on

13.07.2011, which revealed approximately 3 acres of land still

vacant and unutilised.

The 1st Respondent in paragraph 12 of the statement of

objections states P14 was not replied because it had already

been informed to the 2nd Respondent by 1R5 dated 16.03.2011

that no land is available to be given to the Petitioners father.

12

This explanation is unacceptable because P14 was issued after

the second inspection on 13.07.2011.

If the land is no longer necessary for the public purpose for

which it was acquired, it is the duty of the authorities to divest it

to the original owner, provided the requirements under section

39A of the Land Acquisition Act are fulfilled, unless there is a

new public purpose which is prima facie genuine and existent.

Such a [new] public purpose, it was held by the Supreme Court

in De Silva v. Atukorale,6 must be a real and present purpose,

not a fancied purpose or one which may become a reality only in

the distant future. In the facts and circumstances of this case, I

take the view the belated purported new public purpose is not

one that is real and existing.

Section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act reads as follows:

39A. (1) Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under

section 38 (hereafter in this section referred to as a vesting

Order) any land has vested absolutely in the State and

actual possession of such land has been taken for or on

behalf of the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of

section 40, the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette (hereafter in this

section referred to as a divesting Order) divest the State of

the land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

(2) The Minister shall prior to making a divesting Order

under subsection (1) satisfy himself that

6 [1993] 1 Sri LR 283 at 293.

13

(a) no compensation has been paid under this Act to

any person or persons interested in the land in

relation to which the said divesting Order is to be

made;

(b) the said land has not been used for a public

purpose after possession of such land has been

taken by the State under the provisions of paragraph

(a) of section 40;

(c) no improvements to the said land have been

effected after the Order for possession under

paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made; and

(d) the person or persons interested in the said land

have consented in writing to take possession of such

land immediately after the divesting Order is

published in the Gazette.

In the written submissions filed after the argument, the

Respondents state the Petitioner is disentitled to divestiture as

she fails to satisfy 39A(2)(b) above in view of 1R5. I have already

stated the purported reason contained in 1R5 to evade

divestiture cannot be accepted.

In my view, the Petitioner has fulfilled all four requirements set

out in section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act to be eligible for

divestiture.

Accordingly, I quash the newspaper advertisement marked P10

by certiorari insofar as it relates to the rights of the Petitioner,

but without prejudice to 1R4 whereby an Agreement to Sell has

been entered into with a third party for a portion of the land,

14

and direct the 4th Respondent to divest a portion of land in

extent of 1 acre and 2 roods from the 3 acre portion identified in

P14. If, and only if, this is not feasible, the Petitioner shall be

given an alternative portion of land in close proximity to the land

in dispute.

The 1st Respondent shall pay the costs of this application to the

Petitioner.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
