Factual Background

131 The Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) is the tenant cultivator of the paddy land called "Induruwela

Kumbura" and dIe Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter

refen'ed to as dIe Respondent) is dIe owner of the said paddy land. The

Petitioner alleged in her first complaint made to dIe Agralian Services

Divisional Officer dated 02.01.2000 dlat (i) a dispute arose between dIe

Petitioner alld dIe Respondent during a previous cultivating season over

the Respondent's shal"e of dIe paddy yield due to dIe delay on dIe part of

dIe Respondent to settle fertiliser payments to the Petitioner; (ii) dlereati:er,

the Respondent told dIe Petitioner in the first cultivating season of 2001

not to cultivate dIe paddy Ialld alld dlerefore, she refrained from cultivating

dIe said paddy Ialld in question.

141 The Respondent, wllile admitting in her statement made to me SaJ11e

Agrarian Sen1ces Divisional Officer dlat the Petitioner is dIe tenant

cultivator stated Jilter alia, that she duly made payments to the Petitioner

for purchasing fertilisers. The Respondent further stated in her statement

dlat the Petitioner refused to cultivate the paddy Ialld in question

according to dIe previously followed paddy sharing arrangement and dlUs,

she did not wish the Petitioner to cultivate dIe said paddy land.

151 The said first complaint was made on 02.01.2000 when the Agrarian

Services Act No. 58 of 1979 was in operation alld subsequendy, dIe

Parlialnent passed dIe Agrarian Development Act o. 46 of 2000 which

Caine into operation on 18.08.2000. Section 99 (J) of dIe Agrariall

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 repealed the Agrarian Services Act No.

58 of 1979, subject, however, to certain traJIsitional provisions. Thereafter,

certain aJ11endments were made to the Agrarian Development Act No. 46

CPA I 0027 12018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. HClRAl7212016

of 2000 by the Agrarian Development (Amendmentment) Act No. 46 of

2011.

161 On 17.03.2001, the Petitioner made a complaint to the Agrarian

Services Divisional Officer and the Mediation Board in writing that she was

evicted by the Respondent in the first cultivating season of 2001. On

26.03.200 I, 30.12.200 I ,md 08.03.2002, the Petitioner made fi.llther

complaints to the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development that

she was evicted by dIe Respondent in dIe first cultivating season of 2001.

17/ AJdlOUgh dIe Regulations were made by dIe Minister in charge of dIe

subject under dIe Agrarian Development Act widl regard to dIe Inquiry

Procedure and Appeals under dIe Agrarian Development Act by Gazette

Extraordinary No. 1801/36 dated 15.03.2013, the establishment of

Tribunals was delayed for a long period.

Inquiry and Preliminary Objections

18/ After the establishment of dIe Tribunals, dIe Petitioner complied widl

dIe said Regulations and the Agrarian Tribunal commenced proceedings

on 09.04.2015. At die commencement of the inquiry, die Respondent

raised several preliminary objections to dIe jurisdiction of dIe Tribunal

he;uing die complaint of eviction. The main preliminary objections were as

follows:

I. There is no valid complaint of eviction made to the Commissioner-

General in wliting under section 7 (3) of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000;

2. The Respondent was not informed of dIe allegation levelled against

her;

3. The Petitioner has biled to disclose dIe exact date of eviction;

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provinci.llligh Court (Colombo) No. IIC1RAl72/2016

4. The Petitioner has admitted in her letter marked PI that she was

unable to cultivate the paddy land in question;

5. A complaint of eviction has not been made to the Conunissioner

General within 6 months from the date of the alleged eviction in

compliance with section 7 (4) of the Act No. 46 of 2000; and

6. The subject matter of d1e paddy land has been transferred to

anod1er person.

191 The learned President of the Agrarian Tribunal, by his order dated

10.02.2016, dismissed the said preliminary objections and fIXed the matter

for inquiry on d1e question whether or not d1e Petitioner has been evicted.

However, d1e leamed President of d1e Agrarian Tribunal further stated in

her order d1at d1e submission made on behalf of the Respondent d1at d1e

Petitioner had not given d1e Respondent's share of paddy yield has to be

decided separately at d1e conclusion of the inquiry having regard to the

letter said to have been issued by one P. V.Sirisena to the Petitioner (page

189 of d1e brief).

Application in Revision to the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province

1101 Being aggrieved by the order of the leamed President of the Agrarian

Tribunal refusing the said preliminary objections raised by the

Respondent, d1e Respondent preferred an application in revision to d1e

High Cow1: of the Westem Province under Article 154P of the

Constitution read with the provisions of the High Court of d1e Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 to have d1e said order of d1e

leamed President of the Agrarian Tribunal revised.

1111 The parties agreed to conclude d1e matter by way of written

submissions: and the learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated

CPA 100271 2018 Provincial High Courl (Colombo) No. HCIR\ I7212016

05.04.2017 took the view that the application in revision could be disposed

of purely on the determination of the two preliminary objections raised by

the Respondent before the Tribunal, namely, whether there is a valid

complaint of eviction made under section 7 (3) of the Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and whether the complaint of eviction is

prescribed under section 7(4) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of

2000 as amended by the Agrarian Development (Amendment) Act No. 46

of 2011.

1121 The learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 05.04.2017 held

that:

1. The complaint of eviction had been lodged with the Agrarian

Services Divisional Officer who is not entitled to entertain a

complaint of eviction under section 7 (3) of the Agrarain

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and tlUlS, tllere is no valid

complaint of eviction made to the Commissioner-General in telms

of section 7 (3) of tlle Agrarain Development Act No. 46 of 2000;

2. Though tlle Petitioner had claimed that tlle eviction had taken place

on 17.03.200 I, the complaint of eviction had been made to the

Conmlissioner-General only on 19.03.2015 and hence, tlle

complaint made to the Commissioner-General is prescribed under

section 7 (4) of tlle Act.

1131 Accordingly, tlle leamed High Court Judge by his judgment dated

05.04.2017 set aside the order of the Agrarian Tribunal dated 10.02.2016

and allowed the revision application tiled by the Respondent.

Revision Application to the Court of Appeal

1141 Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Provincial High

Court Judge, tlle Petitioner has filed tllis re\~sion application WIder and in

CPA 10027 / 201 8 Provincial J-ligh Court (Colombo) 1'\;0. IIC/RA!72120J6

teffils of Article 138 of the Constitution read with Article 145 of the

Constitution.

Preliminary Objection raised by the Respondent

1151 At the hearing of this application, a preliminary objection was

raised by Mr. Suriyaarachchi, the learned Counsel for the Respondent that

the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke tile revisionary jurisdiction of tile

Court of Appeal against the order made by tile leamed Provincial High

Court Judge exercising revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P of tile

Constitution.

[161 Mr. Suriyaarachchi submitted that the order made by the Provincial

High COUlt allowing the revision application is a final order made in tile

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 154P (c)

read witll section 3 of the High Court of tile Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act No. 19 of 1990 and tllUS, tile Petitioner should have tiled an appeal

against the said fmal order whetller it was made in tile exercise of appellate

or revisionary jurisdiction. He strongly relied on tile decisions of tile

Supreme Court in tile case of Abeygunasekera v. Setunga and Others 1997

(I) Sri LR 62 and Abeywardene v. AJith de Silva 1998 (I) Sri LR 134 in

support of his submission.

1171 Hence, this Court is called upon to decide the Question whether tile

Petitioner is entitled to invoke tile revisionary jurisdiction of tile COUlt of

Appeal under Article 138 of the Constitution against an order made by tile

learned Judge of tile Provincial High Court in tile exercise of revisionary

Jurisdiction confelTed on the High Court by Article 154P of the

Constitution

(a) Right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from High Court in the exercise of its Revisionary Jurisdiction under Article 154P of the Constitution read

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provinciailligh Court (Colombo) No. HClRM72/2016

with the Provisions of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 190f1990.

1181 It is not in dispute that the order made by the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of the Western Province on 05.04.2017 is a final order or

judgment in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction conferred on die

Provincial High Court under section 3 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 read with 154P(3)(c) of die

Constitution. Article 154P (6) of die Constitution provides that, subject to

the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any person aggrieved by a

fmal order, judgment or sentence of any such Court in die exercise of its

jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) or 3 (c) or (4), may appeal to die

Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138 of die Constitution. Article

154P (6) reads as follows:

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, ;1l~V pt'HOI/ agglieved by a final order, judgment or sentence oFallY sllch

Court, in die exerciw~ o/"itSjlllil"riictiol/ Ill/der paragraphs (,'1) (b) or 3 (d or (1,), IlIay appeal liJerefivllJ to the COlllt of Appeal Ii] accOJr/;Il]Ct' with Ar/Jde J 38 .. :

1191 The Petitioner has not appealed to die Court of Appeal under Article

154P (6) of die Constitution against die order of die High Court dated

05.04.2017 made in die exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. I will now

proceed to consider whether die two cases cited by Mr. Suriyaarachchi are

relevant to support his argument that the Petitioner is not entitled to fue a

revision application in die Comt of Appeal when she has failed to file an

appeal to die Court of Appeal in terms of Article 154P(6) read with Article

138(1) of the Constitution.

1201 The Supreme COUIt 1I1 Abeygzll1asekera v. Sedwnga and odJers

(supra) has held dial die Appellate jmisdiction of die COUlt of Appeal

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provincial ~ligh Court (Colombo) No. IIC/RA/72/2016

under Article 138(1) read with Article 154P(6) of the Constitution is not

limited to correcting errors committed by the High Court only in respect of

orders given by way of an appeal and the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction

to hear an appeal against a decision of the High Court whether given by

way of an Appeal or Revision.

1211 It is to be noted, however, that a bench consisting of 5 Judges of the

Supreme Court in Abeywardene v. Aji'th de Silva (supra) did not follow the

said decision. The Supreme Court in Abeywardene v. 4/i'th de Silva

(supra) held that section 9 of the Act o. 19 of 1990 does not give a right

of appeal to the Court of Appeal from an order of the High Court made in

the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. The same view was taken by the

Supreme Court in Wickremasekera v. Officer-in-Charge, Po/ice Station,

Ampara (2004) I Sri LR 264 and MuthdlUsamy Balaganeshall v. The

OfJicer-lil-Charge, Police Station, Seeduwa S.C. SPULA No. 79/2015

decided on 01.04.2016.

1221 The cumulative effect of the provisions of Article 154P (3) (b), 154P

(6) and section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 is that while there is a right of

appeal to the Supreme Court from the orders, etc., of the High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the

appe1late jurisdiction vested in it by Article 154P (3) (b) or section 3 of the

Act No. 19 of 1990 or any other law, there is no right of appeal to the

Supreme Court from the orders made by the High Court in the exercise of

the revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by Article 154P or section 3 of the

Act No. 19 of 1990 (Abeywardene v. AJith de Silva (supra).

1231 Thus, the Petitioner was entitled to fue an appeal to tlle Court of

Appeal in terms of AIticle 138 (1) of tlle Constitution read witll AIticle 15,1.

(6) of tlle Constitution in respect of any fmal order or judgment made by

CI',\ 10027 / 2018 Provincial Uigh Court (Colombo) No. UC/R\I7212016

the Provincial High COUlt in tJle exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction

under section 3 of tJle High Court of tJle Provinces (Special provisions) Act

read witJI Article 154P (3) (c) of ilie Constitution.

(b) Can the Court of Appeal exercise its revisionary powers under Article 138 of the Constitution when no appeal had been filed by the Petitioner

1241 The 13" Amendment to ilie Constitution anlended Article 138 (1) of

tJle Constitution and made ilie High Court of tJle Provinces subject to the

appellate jurisdiction of tJle Court of Appeal. Alticle 138 of the

Constitution enables the Court of Appeal to receive, entertain, hear ;md

dispose or appeals Ii'om the High Court" Omits of First Instance,

tribunals and other inst:il1lt'ions. It also has sole and exclusive jurisdiction,

by way of appeal. revision ;md restitutio Iii liI/CgTl/lJ1, of all causes, suits,

ac!:ions, prosecutions, matters or other instil1ltlons may have taken.

1251 Amended Article 138 (I) of die Constitution reads as follows:

J38- (1) 771c COlli! o/Appcai ,Ikill kne iUld C-YCIU:5C subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, iUl appeUatejwi5r/Ji:'/J()JJ If)r thc corrcction 0/ ;ill ClTOH Iii /;u:t or Ii) law which shall be committed by dlc High Cow!

O)JJ!t o/i"ji:l,t instance, /nbunal or od)er liIS/itli/WIl lllax have taken cogllil'aJJce (cJllpha,lil' addcd)

1261 Thus, tJle Court of Appeal has wide revisionary powers under Article

138 of tJle Cons!:itu!:ion for tJle correction of all errors in fact or in law

which are committed by tJle High Court in tJle exercise of its revisionry

jurisdiction under section 3 of tJle High Court of tJle Provinces (Special

CI';\ 10027 12018 Provincial High ('ourl (Colom bo) No. I-I C /R\ 17212016

provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 read with Article 154P (3)(c) of the

Constitution.

1271 It is trite law that the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is supervisory

in nature and that the object is the proper administration of justice

(Attomey-General v. GunawaJdena (1996) 2 Sri LR 149, at p. 156). In the

case of Marian 13eebee v. Seyed Mohamed 58 NLR 36, Sansoni C.J has

clearly stated the reasons for the exercise of the exu'aordinary power of

revisionary jUlisdiction by Appellate Courts as follows:

"The power of revision is an extramdinaIY power which is quite independent of aIJd distinct Hom dJe appeUate jwisdiction of dJJS

Cowt. Its object IS dIe due admiJ21stration of justice aIJd dIe correction of errors, sometimes committed by dJJS Cow! liseU; Ij7 older to aVOId flJJscarriages of justice. It IS exercIsed IjJ some cases by a Judge of Ius own motion, when aIJ aggrieved person who may not be a party to dIe action brings to IllS notice dJe fact that unless d7e power IS exerCIsed Injustice will result"

1281 In my view, the Court of Appeal has wide powers to grant relief in

appropriate cases by way of revision, as the interests of justice may require,

eidler, ex meTO moto or on any application made, where it appears dlat a

miscarriage of justice has occurred or dlere are special circumstances which

warrant dle intervention of dle Court under Article 138 of dle Constitution.

1291 Relief by way of revision had been granted by dle Supreme Court in

cases where dlere is no appeal that has been flied and even in the absence

of a separate application for revision. In dle early case of RaIJaslj7ghe II;

HeJ21Y I NLR 303, the appeal was dismissed on dle ground dlat no appeal

lies from a clainl order made by the District Court, but dle Supreme Court

took up the case in revision, when it was found dlat an order of the District

COUIt was ex facie wrong.

CP,\ 10027 12018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. HC/RAl7212016

1301 In A. SilwadlaIl!idl1J and aIlOdler v. E. MeeraI1Jolwdeen 60 NLR 394,

T.S. Femando.J. stated that "The Supreme Court possesses the power to

set aside, in revision, an erroneous decision of the District Court in an

appropriate case even though an appeal against such decision con"ectly

held to have abated on the ground of non-compliance witll some of tlle

technical requirements in respect of the notice of security".

1311 Similarly, in Rusheed Ali v. MolwJJed All; (1981) 2 Sri LR 29, tlle

Court of Appeal held tllat tlle powers of revision conferred on tlle COUIt of

Appeal are very wide and tlle COUIt has the discretion to exercise tllem

whether an appeal lies or not or whether an appeal had been tlken or not

However, tlus discretionary remedy can be invoked only where there are

"exceptional circumstances" warranting tlle intervention of the Court. In tlle

case of ParapragasaJJJ & anodler v S.A. EmnwllIe/, (C.A. 931/88 - D.C.

]affila U4772 - C.A.M. 24.7.91) Weerasekera, ]. made the following

observations on tlus question.

'~ .. .It is now settled law diat die power olrevision vested so IiI dIe Cowt ol Appeal is a dI:5CretionaIY remedy. The pracDce is not to exeni5e die power ofrevision when aIly odler or alternate remedy is aVailable for dIe reason dlat it is a discreD"onaIY remedy vested in

COWl aIld it is exercised when die applicant has no odler remedy. But it is also now settled law dlat die revisionaIY power would be exercised even dlOugh dlere is ail altemate remedy only If dlere is dIe existence of special Cli"Cu11lstances aIe shown necessitaDilg die lildulgence by Court to exercise its disaeDOnaIY remedy of reviSIOn. '

1321 Mr. Suriyaarachclll however, subnutted tllat tlle Petitioner has failed to

aver in tlle Petition as to why she invoked tlle revisionary jurisdiction of tlle

COUIt of Appeal instead of the appellate jurisdiction of tlle Court of

Appeal against tlle said judgment. The Petitioner has in fact averred in

paragraph 28 of tlle Petition tllat she tiled a Leave to Appeal Application

CPA i 0027 i 2018 Provinriailligh Court (Colombo) No. HCiR~ ini2016

in dIe Supreme Court against d1e said order of me Provincial High Court

dated 05.04.2017 and mereafter, she widIdrew me said Application on

30.01.2018 reserving her right to invoke d1e revisionary jurisdiction of die

Court of Appeal ag-ainst d1e said judgment

1331 The Petitioner has dlUs, filed a Leave to Appeal Application in dIe

Supreme Court against dIe said judgment of dIe learned Provincial High

Court Judge dated 05.04.2017 made in dIe exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction under section 3 of me High Court of me Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990. Accordingly, dIe Petitioner having

mistakenly filed a Leave to Appeal Application in me Supreme Court

against dIe said judgment, widIdrew me said Leave to Appeal Application

and ftled dus revision application in dUs Court under Article 138 of dIe

Constitution seeking to set aside dIe said judgment

1341 The Petitioner has pleaded in dIe Petition dIat me findings of dIe

learned High CourtJudge mat dIe Petitioner has not filed a valid complaint

to me Commissioner-General in terms of section 7 (3) of dIe Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and dIat me Petitioner's complaint of

eviction is prescribed for non-compliance widI section 7 (3) of d1e said Act

are manifesdy erroneous and caused a denial of justice warranting dIe

interference of d1e Court of Appeal under Article 138 of me Constitution

(Vide-paragraphs 23 and 24 (e) and (f) of me Petition).

1351 For dIose reasons, I hold dIat dIe Court of Appeal has revisionary

jurisdiction to grant relief to dIe Petitioner. in respect of me inIpugned

order made by dIe Provincial High Court Judge in dIe exercise of its

revisionary jurisdiction, whemer an appeal had been taken or not, if it

appears to Court dlat a miscarriage 'of justice has occurred or exceptional

CP,\ 10027 I ZOl8 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No.IIC/R.\/72/Z016

circumstances exist warranting the exercise of revisionary powers of the

Court of Appeal under Article 138 (1) of the Constitution.

Other Points for Determination

1361 At dIe healing, in addition to dIe aforesaid preliminal)' oqjection, both

parties restricted their submissions to the following matters:

1. Whether dIe Provincial High Court had revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of dIe impugned order made by dIe Agrariall Tribunal

under the provisions of dIe Agrariall Development Act No. 46 of

2000 after the repeal of the Agrariall Services Act No. 58 of 1979;

2. Whedler dIe Petitioner is guilty of laches in pursuing dIe revision

application;

3. Whedler there was a valid complaint of eviction under section 7 (3)

of dIe Agral-iall Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as aJ11ended;

4-. Whedler the complaint of eviction is prescribed under section 7 (4)

of dIe Agrariall Development Act No. 4-6 of 2000 as aJ11ended.

Did the Provincial High Court have revisionary jurisdiction in respect of all order made by the Agrarian Tribunal under section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 after the Repeal of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979?

1371 At dIe healing, Mr. Weragoda, dIe learned Counsel for dIe Petitioner

submitted dlat dIe Provincial High Court of the Western Province did not

have dIe revisionary jurisdiction to hear alld determine dIe Respondent's

revision application filed in the Provincial High COUlt for dIe following

reason:

(i) The Agralian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 was repealed by dIe

Agrariall Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and dms, the references

to sections 3 alld 5 of dIe Agraliall Services Act No. 58 of 1979

CPA i 0027 i 2018 I'rovinciall1igh Court (Colombo, No. HCiRAl72i2016

found in the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 are of no relevance or consequence due to the

repeal of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 by the

Parliament.

1381 I shall now proceed to consider the said argument of Mr. Weragoda

in detail. By Article 154P of the Constitution, the Provincial High COUIt

was established and the sole jurisdiction which was conferred on the COUIt

of Appeal by Article 138 of the Constitution was expanded to Provincia.l

High Courts by Article 154P (3) and (4) of the Constitution. Article 154P

(3) (b) of the Constitution conferred on the Provincial High Court

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences

and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Court~

within the Province. Article 154P (3) (b) reads as follows:

"(3) Every such High Court shall-

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province ".

(a) Appellate and Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court in

respect of orders made under section 5 and 9 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 in respect of any land situated within the Province

1391 Article 154P (3) (c) of the Constitution enacts that every such High

Court shall "exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament by

law, provide". This paved the way for Parlian1ent to confer further

jurisdiction (other than those set out in Article 154P (3) (a) and (b) and

154P (4) (a) and (b)) on the Provincial High Court by other laws passed by

Parliament. Article 154 (P) (3) (c) enabled Parlian1ent to enact the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 to make

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. IIC/RAl72!2016

provISIon regarding the procedure to be followed in, and the right of

appeal to, and from the High Court established under Article 154P of die

Constitution and for matters connected dlerewidl or incidental dlereto.

1401 Section 3 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 created a new jurisdiction and suqject to ,my law, it

conferred appellate ,md revisionary jUJisdiction on die Provincial High

Court in respect of orders made by Labour Tlibunals widlin die Province

and orders made wider section 5 or section 9 of die Agrarian Services Act,

No. 58 of 1979, in respect of any land situated within die Province.

1411 Section 3 of die High Court of die Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No. 19 of 1990 reads as follows:

1431 In Abeysiri v. Premaratlle (2000) 3 Sri LR 373, 375, the Court of

Appeal considered the scope of the revisionary jUlisdiction of the

Provincial High Court in respect of an order made under the repealed

Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979. The Court of Appeal held that d1e

Provincial High COUIt has appeUate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of orders made under section 5 and 9 of d1e AgraJian Services Act No. 58

of 1979, in respect of any land situated wid1in d1e Province. The Court of

Appeal held at pages 375-376 that:

"Accordlilg to Sections 3 aud 4 of dIe High COUlt of dle Provinces (Specia.! proVIsions) Act No. 19 of 1990, a High Court shall exercIse appeUate aud reVIsionary jUl1sdic/ion ill respect of orders made

In view of dle above plVVIsions of law a High Court of dle province hilS appeJlate and revIsionaIY jurisdiction only ill respect of orders made under Section 5 aud Sec/ion 9 of dJe Agrarian Services Act.

Therefore dle High Court hilS no appeUate aud revlsionaIY jUl1sdiction lil respect of orders made UJ1der the odler Sec/ions of

CPA I 0027 12018 Provincial High Coorl (Colombo) No. JlC/RA/7212016

1441 It is crystal clear that a Provincial High Court has appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders made under section 5 or 9 of

the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979, in respect of any land situated

within that Province.

(b) Effect of the Reference to Section 5 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 found in section 3 and 4 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special provisions) Act on Section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000

1451 The Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 was repealed by section 99

(1) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 subject to certain

transitional provisions and the said Act was further amended by Act No. 46

of 20 II. The expression "repeal of a statute" generally COlllotes the

complete abrogation or obliteration of one statute by a subsequent statute

(N. S. Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed. p. 1530). According to

the Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1463, the term "repeal" is the abrogation or

annulling of a previously existing law by die enactment of a subsequent

statute which declares dlat die former law shall be revoked and abrogated,

(which is called 'express' repeal), or which contains provisions so contrary

to or irreconcilable widl d10se of the earlier law dlat only one of die two

statutes can stand in force, (called 'implied' repeal).

1461 Lord Tenterden stated in SUTtees v. EDison 119471 F.C.R. 141 at 166

that the rule of English Conmlon Law was dlat if an Act was repealed, then

in the absence of any provision in it to die contrary, it was deemed "dlat

die repealed Act never existed except as to matters and transactions past

and closed". This is die general rule. In Lelllm v. Mitcbell (1912) A.C.

400 (406), dleir Lordships quoted from die decision of Tindal, CJ., in Kay

v. Goodwin (1830) 6 Bing. 576 : 130 E.R. 1403 to explain die exception to

die general rule as follows:

CPA 10027 12018 I'rovinrial l1igh Courl (Colombo) No. BCIRAI7212016

"J take the eH(xt of repealing a statute w.:IS to obliterate it completely fj-om the records of dIe Par/iament as if it had never been passed; and it must be consIdered as a /,1W that never existed, except for dJe pUJpose of dIOse actions which were commenced, prosecuted, and conduded whilst it was an existing law'~

1471 This was the rule of the English common law which was applied in cases

of statutes which were repealed and under this rule, the effect of the repeal is

that it is to be taken as if the statute had never been enacted, except as to

transactions begun or prosecuted while it was existing law.

1481 Mr. Weragoda argues that although section 3 of dle dle High Court of

dle Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 confers the

revisionary jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court in respect of orders

made under section 5 or 9 dle Agrarian Services Act TO. 58 of 1979, dle

same section does not refer to orders made under the Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000. He argues that dle revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court is taken away with the repeal of

dle Agrarian Services Act o. 58 of 1979 and dlerefore, the references to

dle Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 found in section 3 and 4 of dle

High Court of die Provinces (Special Provisions) Act 10 . 19 of 1990 are

now of no force due to the repeal of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of

1979.

Construction of references to repealed enactments

1491 Mr. Weragoda's argument is likely to succeed in a situation where dle

references to any provision of the repealed Act are not made part of dle

New Agrarian Development Act or such references are so contrary to or

inconsistent widl or irreconcilable widl those of dle corresponding

provisions of dle Agrarian Development Act, so dlat two cannot stand

CPA 10027 12018 Provincial High Courl (Colombo) No. 1ICIRA17212016

together, in which case the maxm1, Jeg:5 posteriors contrarias abrogallt-

meaning "later laws abrogate earlier, contrary ones" applies.

1501 I am not inclined to agree with Mr. Weragoda's argument, first, in

view of section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance, which has made an

express provision to counteract the effect of repeal and refers to

"Reference to Repealed Enactment~". Section 16 provides that where an

Act is repealed and re-enacted with or without modification, the references

to the provision of a fom1er enactment, shall be construed as references to

the corresponding provision so re-enacted. Section 16 of the Interpretation

Ordinance reads as follows:

"(I) HI,Ilere in any WIitten Jawor docwnent, reference is made to allY written Jaw which is subsequendy repeale(i, such reference shall be deemed to be made to dIe written Jaw by wfudl the repeal is ellected or to dIe COI1':5POlldJilg portion dJeJ':ofj

(2) 77us section shall appJy to WIitten Jaws and documents made as well befOl': as afier dIe commencement ofdu:5 Ordinance. "

1511 Section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance which refers to the

construction of references to repealed enactments provides a guard against

the normalleg-al effect of a repeal under the English Common Law. Thus,

where any Act is repealed and re-enacted, references to provisions of the

repealed former enactment must be read and construed as references to

the corresponding re-enacted new provisions, unless a different intention

appears (State Through 5.p., New Dellu' v. RalrYI La! NOla, Case No.

Appeal (crl.) 532 of 2004 decided on 26 April, 2004). This Indian case has

interpreted section 8 of the Indian General Clauses Act that has a similar

meaning to section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka.

CPA 10027 / 20 18 Provinciailligh Courl (Colombo) No. IIClRV72/2016

1521 It is a well-known rule of stallltory construction that where the words

of an old stalllte are made part of a new stalllte, the legal interpretation

which has been put upon the former by courts of law is applicable to those

sanle words in the new stalllte (M J. M Nilamdeen v. D. R. C

Nanayillara 76 N.L.R. 169 at 171 referring to the following statement

made by James LJ. in The Reverend 77lOmas PeUJam Dale's and The

Reverend R. W. A/waght's Case (1881) 6 Q.B.D. 376 at 453):

"Now where dJe words of an old statute are either IJ<llJscnbed into or by reference made part ofa new statute, it is a rule ofcOIJStrucliolJ dJat dlls i5 done with the 00fxt and mtent of adopting any legal intelpretalion WlllCh has been put upon them by COUlts of law, dJe same words being used in order dJat evelytlJing dJat had been setded before as 10 dJeir construction should remain settled without kesh litigation. "

1531 I will now proceed to determine whether the reference to the repealed

Act can be construed as reference to the corresponding provisions of the

new Act. In short the issue is, when dle Agrarian Services Act is repealed

and re-enacted by Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, is it possible

to construe dle reference to section 5 of the repealed Act, as dle reference

to dIe corresponding section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of

2000 as anlended.

1541 In the present case, the repeal is followed by a new legislation and

hence, it is necessary to consider whedler the new legislation has been

enacted on dle same subject, namely, the rights of the tenant cultivators,

the manner of making a complaint of eviction, the inquiry procedure and

restriction of eviction of tenant cultivators of paddy lands. Secondly, it is

also crucial to consider whedler the new legislation manifests an intention

incompatible widl or contrary to dle provisions of dle repealed Act. In

order to resolve dlis dispute, it is necessary to examine in some detail dle

CPA 10027 12018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. IIC/RAl7212016

references to the provisions of the old Act and the new Act for the purpose

of determining whether they have been enacted on the same or different

subject or whether they indicate same or different intentions. Such

incompatibility would have to be ascertained from a consideration of all the

relevant provisions of the new statute related to the subject and the mere

absence of a saving clause is by itself not material (T.S. Baliah v. T.S.

Rangachari, AIR 1969 SC 70 I).

1551 When the Agrarian Development Act was repealed by Parliament and

the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and the Agrarian

Development (Amendment) Act No. 46 of 2011 was enacted, most of the

subsections found in section 5 of dle Agrarian Services Act were retained

by section 7 of dle Agrarian Development Act widl certain modifications.

As noted, dle side note of section 5 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of

1979, namely, "Rights of tenant cultivators, provision in regard to certain

evicted tenants of paddy lands and restriction of eviction of tenants of

paddy lands" is dle identical side note found in section 7 of dle Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

1561 Further, subsections 1 (rights of tenant cultivators), 2 (protection of a

tenant cultivator against a partition decree,S (presumption) and a portion

of subsection 6- (appeal to the Board of Review), a portion of subsection 7

(orders to be made), 8 (payment of danlages), 9 (except the second

proviso), 10, 11, 12 and 15 of section 6 (procedure at dle inquiry) were

also retained in section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000

as amended by Act No. 46 of 2011.

1571 The modifications in subsections (3), (4), (6) and (7) of section 7 of the

Agrarian Development Act only relate to dle following matters:

CPA 1002712018 Provinciall-ligh Court (Colombo) No. I--IC/RA!72!2016

(i) The authority to whom the complaint of eviction shall be made,

namely, Commissioner-General instead of the Commissioner

referred to in the old Act;

(ii) The period within which the complaint of eviction shall be made,

namely, within a period of 6 mondls from die date of eviction

instead of I year or 2 years respectively referred to in the old Act;

(iii) The audlority before whom the inquiry is to be conducted, namely,

a Tribunal instead of an inquiry officer;

(iv) The right of appeal given to the High Court of the Province against

the decision made by the Board of Review instead of the Court or

Appeal refen'ed to in die old Act; and

(v) Orders to be made by the Commissioner-General instead of die

Comissioner eidler upon die receipt of the decision of die Tribunal

where no appeal has been made or receipt of die decision or die

Board of Review where an appeal has been made to the Board of

Review or receipt of the decision of the High Court where an appeal

has been made to the High Court under (subsections 7).

1581 As noted, die side notes of section 5 of the Agrarian Services Act and

section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act are almost identical and die

words of section 5 of die Agrarian Services Act have been made part or the

corresponding section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act with certain

modifications, which are not inconsistent or contrary to or repugnant to die

provisions of section 5 of die Agrarian Services Act.

1591 Thu.s, when die Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 was repealed

and re-enacted widl the Agrarian Development Act o. 46 of 2000 as

anlended, the references to die repealed Agrarian Services Act would be

considered as the references to die colTesponding portion of die Agrarian

Development Act, unless a different intention is expressed by die

CPA 1002712018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No, IIClRA!7212016

Legislature or such cOITesponding portion is contrary to or inconsistent

with those of the new Act so that the two Gumot stand together. I am of

the view that the reference to section 5 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58

of 1979 that is found in sections 3 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 must now be construed as the

reference to section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as

amended by Act No. 46 of2011.

(d}Was the Respondent entitled to fIle a reVISlOn application in the Provincial. High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution without preferring an appeal to the Board of Review established under section 42A of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000?

1601 I will now proceed to consider dle second argument of Mr.

Weragoda. He submitted dlat dle Agrarian Development Act does not

confer revisionary jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court pertaining to

the orders made under dle Act as tlle High Court of dle Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act does not refer to dle Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of

2000. He further submitted dlat in temlS of dle Agrarian Development Act

No. 46 of 2000 as amended by Act No. 46 of 2011, any person aggrieved

by dle decision of the Tribunal has a right of appeal to dle Board of

Review and thereafter, any aggrieved party from a decision of dle Board of

Review can prefer an appeal to the High Court.

1611 In the circumstances, he argued that once the Agrarian Services Act

was repealed, dle procedure widl regard to appeals shall be exercised in the

manner provided by dle Agrarian Development Act and dlliS, dle

Respondent carmot bypass the Board of Review and file a revision

application in dle Provincial High Court direcdy as it has happened in the

present case. His argument was dlliS, dlat dle provincial High Court did

not have revisionary jurisdiction to hear and determine dle Respondent's

CP,\ / 0027 / 2018 Provinciallligh Courl (Colombo) No. IIC/R\ /72/2016

application as the revisionary jurisdiction is vested only with the Court of

Appeal.

1621 It is to be stressed at the outset that the jurisdiction conferred on the

Court of Appeal by Article 138 of the Constitution shall be exercised

subject to the provisions of the Constitution and of any law. As noted

earlier, tlle Provincial High Court has power to exercise revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of orders made by the Agrarian Tlibunal under

section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act as section 7 of tlle Agnuian

Development Act con-esponds to section 5 of the Agrarian Service Act o.

58 of 1979. As noted, in temlS of section 3 of the High Court of tlle

Provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, tlle Provincial High

Court shall, subject to any law, exercise revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of an order made under section 7 of tlle Agrarian Development Act, which

corresponds to section 5 of the repealed Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of

1979.

1631 Thus, the revisionary jurisdiction conferred on tlle Provisional High

Court by section 3 of tlle High Court of tlle Provinces (Special provisions)

Act in respect of orders made under section 7 of the Agrarian

Development Act shall be exercised subject to the provisions of tlle

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

1641 It is important to examine fIrst, the scope of the decisions to be made

by tlle Agricultural Tribunals and the Board of Review under tlle AgraJian

Development Act. Secondly, it is also important to consider whether the

revisionary jurisdiction conferred on the Provincial High Court by section

3 of the High Court of tlle Provinces (Special Provisions) Act has been

taken away by section 7 of tlle Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

CPA 100271 2018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. HCIRAI7212016

Scope of Inquiry and Nature of the Decision to be made by the Agricultural Tribunal under Act No. 46 of 2000

1651 Section 7 (3) of the Agrarian Development Act provides that once a

notitication is made to the Commissioner-General by a tenant cultivator,

the Commissioner-General shall refer such notification to the Agrarian

Tribunal to hold an inquiry tor deciding whether or not a person has been

evicted. Section 7 (3) reads as follows:

"Where a tenant cultivator of any extent of paddy land notIfies dJe

COJmnissionel~General in wnlIiJg dlat he has been evicted limn such extent, dJe COJmnissioner-Generai shall rek:r dle matter to dIe AgraIiaIJ Tribunal aIld dli-ect dle tI1bunal to hold r111 inquiry for the purpose of deciding the question whether or not such person has been evicted"

1661 The scope of the inquiry to be held by the Agrarian Tribunal is set out

in section 7 (5) and 7 (6) of the Agrarian Development Act as tollows:

(5) Hat dJe lnqwiy held by die Agnuian TnbunaJ, it is proved to dJe satI:5&ction of dJe AgraIian Tnbunal dJat dJe tenaIlt cultivator had been evicted limn such extent, it shall be presumed, unless dJe contraIY is proved, that sudJ eviction had been made by, or at dle InstaIJce of dle laIldlord;

(6) The laIJdlOJd of dJe extent of paddy laIJd aIJd dJe person evicted shall be given all oppOJtunity of being heard by the l-espectI've Agrarl~1JJ TnbunaJ. On the condusion of the inquiry, dJe decision of dJe AgraIian Tnbunal shall be

communicated in wnlIilg by l-egistered post to dle ConlITJSJi"oner-GeneraJ, dJe landlord aIJd dJe person evicted

1671 The inquiry procedure to be tollowed by the Tribunal is set out in

Part 1 of the Regualations made by the Minister of Economic

Development published in the Gazettee Extraordinary No. 1801/36 dated

15.03.2013. It is crystal clear that the scope of the inquiry is to decide

CPA 10027 120 18 Provinciailligh Court (Colombo) No, IICIRAl7212016

whether or not the tenant cultivator has been evicted from the paddy land

in question in violation of the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act.

1681 The decision in terms of section 7 (6) of the Agrarian Development

Act as amended has to be made after giving an opportunity of being heard

in person or through a representative, at such inquiry by the Agrarian

Tribunal. The decision to be made by the Tribunal under section 7 (6)

relates to !lIe question whether or not the person who has made the

complaint as a tenant cultivator has been evicted in violation of !lIe

Provisions of the Agrarian Development Act.

Appeal to the Board of Review from the Decision of the Tribunal and Nature of Decision of the Board of Review

1691 Section 7 (6A) of !lIe Agrarian Development Act o. 46 of 2011 has

granted a right to any party aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal to

appeal to the Board of Review. Section 7 (6A) reads as follows:

"(6:4) 17le JandJord or dIe person evicted who is aggrieved by die decision of the Agr<JIiaIl Tnounal may, widlliJ dllTty days of dJe

1701 In terms of !lIe Agrarian Development Act, the right to ftle an appeal

to !lIe Board of Review has been granted in respect of a decision of the

Tribunal, which relates to the question whether or not an eviction has

taken place as contemplated by sections 7 (6A) of !lIe Act.

Appeal to the High Court from the Decision of the Board of Review

1711 The Agrarian Development Act further makes provision in section 7

(6C) for any person aggrieved by such a decision of the Board of Review to

appeal to the Provincial High Court Section 7 (6C) reads as follows:

"(6C) The landlord or the person evicted who i5 aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Review may, Wldun durfy days 0/ dle communication o/dle decision to IlJin, appea./ to dle High Court 0/ dle Province a.ga.Jilst such decision on a question 0/ law.

1721 Section 7(7) further refers to the orders to be made by the

Commissioner-General on the basis of the following decisions made by the

Board of Review or the Provincail High Court. Section 7 (7) reads as

follows:

1731 It seems to me that the Board of Review in appeal may, decide

whether or not an eviction has taken place (section 7 (7)(a)) and the

Provincial High Court may, in appeal, either confirm or vary such decision

of the Board of Review. Hence, the confirmation or variation of die

decision of die Board of Review by die High Court relates only to die

question whedler or not an eviction of a tenant cultivator has taken place

widun the meaning of die Agnuian Development Act

(a) Nature of the Decision made by the Agricultural Tribunal

1741 It is abundandy clear dlat the decision of the Tribunal was to refuse all

6 preliminary objections raised by die Respondent objecting to die

jurisdiction of die Tribunal. Furthermore, as noted in paragraph 8 of dlis

order, die preliminary objection 4 was overruled subject to furdler review

by dIe Tribunal at die conclusion of die inquiry with regard to the

settlement of die Respondent's share of paddy yield. Thus, the Tribunal

has not so far, held an inquiry under sections 7 (5) and 7 (6) of die Act and

made no final decision on the question whether or not the Petitioner has

(6) read widl section 7(a) of the Agrarian Development Act The decision

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) '0. HClRA/7212016

of the Tribunal is an interlocutory order which does not fall within a

decision to be made by Ule Tribunal at the conclusion of the inquiry

contemplated by die provisions of die AgTariall Development Act No. 46

of ~WOO.

1761 An Appeal is a statutOlY right ;lIld must be expressly created and

granted by the st.o1.tute and it GUlIlOt be implied (lJaKmeewewa v. /?;!ia

R/R9 S.c. minutes of 15.0a.199l). A pelllsal of die order made by tlle

Tribunal on 10.02.2016 reveals that it is not a final order having the effect

of deciding the question whedler or not an eviction has taken place. It is

settled law that a final order is one made on any application or proceeding

dlat, for whichever side the order was given, it will, if it stands, finally

determine the matter in litigation (dictum of Lord Esher, MR in SaJamaJJ v.

WaJ1Jer& odlers (l89l) 1 Q.I3. 73<1., (c. A).

1771 In the present case, the the preliminary objections were r~ieCled by die

Tribunal sul~ject to the above-mentioned v;u'iation and die matter W,LS fixed

t()r inquirv. It is absolutely cie;u' that the order made by die Tribunal on

10.02.20 I Ii overruling the said preliminary objections, slll~ject to the said

variation, is not. a decision contemplated by section 7 (G) of the AI,'Tarian

Development Act. It is only an interlocutory order made by the Tribunal

refusing preliminary ol~jectiollS to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which in

my view, did not finally decide die rights of the parties, n;unely, die

question whether or not. an eviction has t;tken place within the me;lIling of

section 7 (G) of the AgT;uian Development Act.

Has the Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court been taken

away by section 7 (6A) of the Agrarian Development Act?

CI';\ / 0027 / 2018 Provinciailligh Court (Colombo) No. IIClR\ /nI2016

17RI Mr. Wera~oda's ar,,'umenl also centered OIl the proposition that

where a statute confers jurisdic[jon on tlle Tribunal, it must be taken to

have impliedly gr;mted the power of doing all such acts as are essentially

necessalY to its exercise. This proposition was lucidly explained by Asquith

1..]. in the case of Wilkinson v. BarkingCorpOralioIJ. 1194811 K.B. 721 at

725 as follows:

"It is undoubtedly good law dJal where a statute creates a right and, in plaJiJ laJJguage, gives a specific remedy or appoints a specilic lnbunalfor its enforcement, a party seekiJJg to enforce dJe right must resort to dlat remedy or that tnbuna/, aJJd not to odJers. As the House of Lords ruled in Pasmore v. Oswaldtwisde U.D.C. /18981 A. C. 387; 394. (Per Lord Halsbury): The pnnciple dJat where a speajic remedy is given by a statute, it thereby deprives dIe person

who illsists upon a remedy of aJlY other fon]) of remedy d1aJJ dIat given by dIe statute, is one wluch is very familiar aJJd wlllch mns

duvugh dIe law'.

/791 The rule that "where an Act creates an obligation and provides a

remedy, no other remedy can be adopted" does not apply here. There is

no provision in the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as anlended

by Act No. 46 of 2011 that provides that any decision made by the

Tribunal, whether interlocutory or final, in respect of the inquiry held

under section 7 shall be decided by the Board of Review in the exercise of

its appellate jurisdiction. The Agrarian Development Act has conferred

appellate power on the Board of Review either to confmn or vary the

decision made by the Tribunal and such decision refers to the ques[jon

whether or not an eviction has taken place.

1801 When the jurisdiction has been conferred by the Agrarian

Development Act on the Board of Review either to COnfll111 or vary the

decision made by the Tribunal on the ques[jon whether or not an evic[jon

has taken place, no new jurisdiction which is not vested in it under the

CPA 10027 12018 Provincial High Coorl (Colombo) No. HCIR~I7212016

provisions of the statute can be presumed to have been confelTed on the

Board of Review. In PIVSUlJJ10 Coomar Paul v. Koylash Clwnder Paul, 8

WR 428, 436 Peacock C.] said:

"llie Jil/1:~dictJI)/} of the orrhil;u:v COllrts o/jildicatllre is not 10 be I;,ken away by plllling ;/ constl7lcljon upon ;UI Act oFthe leb'7:~/atllre,

1811 When the jurisdiction is not clearly indicated in the language of a

statute, the court~ will lean against an ouster of the jurisdiction of the

ordinary courts, except in cases which are clearly and specifically indicated

by the legislature itself (Yllsur Leva; Salleb (Mhd) v. H;yi Mohol1JJ11ad

HussaJil Rowtiler (1963) 2 Mad L.] 287, 76 MLW 482). In my view,

section 7 (6B) of the Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended by Act No. 46 of

20 II, created no additional statutory obligation on the Board of Review in

dle exercise of the appellate jurisdiction, to review an order of interlocutory

nature made by dle Tribunal on the question of jurisdiction.

1821 In my view, dle oridinary revisionary jurisdiction conferred on the

Provincial High COUIt by section 3 of dle High COUIt of dle Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 in respect of dle interlocutOIY

order in question made by the Tribunal is not ousted by the appellate

power given to dle Board of Review under section 7 (6A) and (6B) of die

Agrarian Development Act.

1831 For those reasons, I hold dlat dle Provincial High Court of the

Western Province had revisionary jurisdiction in terms of section 3 of the

High Court of dle Provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 in

respect of dle inlpugned interlocutory order made by the Tribunal under

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provindailligh Court (Colombo) No. 1-IC/RA!72/2016

section 7 (6) of the Agrarian Development, which now corresponds to

section 5 of dIe repealed Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 found in

section 3 of dIe High Court of dIe Provinces (Special provisions) Act No.

19 of 1990.

Has fue Petitioner made a Valid Complaint of Eviction under fue Provisions of fue Agrarian Development Act wiiliin fue Prescribed Period?

1841 Mr. Weragoda and Mr. Suriyaarachchi made lengdlY and elaborate

submissions on dIe two questions of dIe order made by dIe leanled High

COUlt judge, namely, whedler or not dIe complaint of eviction is a valid

complaint under section 7 (3) and if so, whefuer or not it is prescribed in

temlS of section 7 (4) of fue Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as

amended.

1851 Mr. Suriyaarachchi argued at dIe hearing fuat as dIe complaint of

eviction had been made to an Agrarian Development Officer and not to

dIe Commissioner-General of Agrarian Services, dlere was no valid

complaint of eviction made by fue Petitioner under section 7 (3) of dIe

Agrarian Development Act and fuus, fue Commssioner-General had no

power to refer fue complaint to fue Agrarian Tribunal directing fue

Tribunal to hold an inquiry.

1861 The learned High Court judge has taken fue view dlat complaint of

eviction dated 17.03.2001 marked "PI" had been addressed to fue

Agrarian Services Divisional Officer who was not aufuorised to exercise dIe

powers of fue Commissioner-General under section 38 of dIe Agrarian

Development Act and fuerefore, fue Petitioner has not made a valid

complaint of eviction to dIe Commissioner-General in terms of section 7

(3) of die Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (Vide- pages 104-105

of fue brieO.

CPA 1 0027 / 20 18 Provincial High Courl (Colombo) No. IIC/RA17212016

1871 I shall consider first, as to when the Petitioner had made a complaint

of eviction and second, whether the Petitioner's complaint of eviction is a

valid complaint in terms of section 7 (3) of die Agrarian Development Act

No. 46 of 2000 as anlended. The remedy of the tenant cultivator who

complains of eviction is set out in section 7 (3) of the AgraIian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000, which reads as follows:

"Where a tenant cultivator of aIly extent of paddy land notifies IDe Commissioner-General in writing IDat he has been evicted from such extent, such Commissioner-General shall refer ilie matter to the AgrariaIl Tribunal aIld direct the Tribunal to hold all inquiry for die purpose of deciding ilie question whedler or not such person has been evicted."

1881 Section 7 (4) of ilie s;une Act provides dlat such notification "shall be

made within six mondls from ilie date of such eviction.

(a) Definition of "Eviction" widlin IDe meaning of IDe Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000

1891 It must be stressed here iliat die notification referred to in subsection

(3) of section 7 has to be one of IDe eviction of ilie tenant cultivator aIld not

a drreat to evict or interference in ilie use or occupation or cultivation of a

paddy laIld. The word "evict" has been defined in section 100 of ilie

AgraliaIl Development Act No. 46 of 2000 in ilie following temlS:

" 'Evict'lil relation to a tenant cultivator olpaddy land means to deplive a tenant cultivator olhis right to use, occupy and cultivate dIe whole or any pall oldIe extent olpaddy land let to lum, by dIe use oldlicxt or lndirect medlOds'~

1901 Eviction of a tenaIlt cultivator i'om ilie paddy laIld cai;J be caused by

direct medlOds such as a physical dispossession (direct eviction) or by

indirect meiliods of disrupting dle services aIld facilities dlat contribute to

dle use, occupy aIld cultivate dle paddy laIld such as by cutting off all water

C!',\ 10027/2018 !'rovinciaill igh Courl (Colombo) No. IIC1RA/72/20 16

and access facilities to the paddy land (constructive eviction). The eviction

may also be total or partial. It is total, when the tenant cultivator is wholly

deprived of his light to use, occupy and cultivate in the whole land or

partial, when he is deprived of only a portion of the paddy land.

1911 It is significant to consider whed1er d1e meaning given to d1e

expression "interference" in d1e deeming section 7 (1 4) would fall within

the defmition "evict" in section lOO of the Agrarian Development Act No.

46 of 2000. Section 7 (1) reads as follows:

"A tenant cultivator of any extent of paddy land shall have tile light to occupy and use sud l extent in accordance with the provisions of dlls Act and shall not be evicted !i'om such extent nOlwidlslandlilg anyt/llilg to dIe contraIy in any oral or written agn:ement by which such extent has been let to such tenant cultivatOl; and no person shaD interfere with the occupation and use of such extent by the tenant cultivator and dIe landlord shaD not demand or receive /lV llJ dIe tenant cultivator any rent in excess of dIe rent reqUlir:d by d]}s Act, to be paid in lr:Spect ofsuch extent to dIe landlord. "

1921 Section 7 (1 4) provides as follows:

"(14) If any person dlir:cdy or indirecdy makes use of, or threatens to make use of, force, violence or restraint; or inDicts or threatens to inDict; ally harm, danlitge or loss upon or against a tenallt cultivator

of any extent of paddy land in order to induce, compel or prevail upon dlat tenallt cultivator to re1Tain !Tom exercising any right or privilege conferred upon him by or under d]}s Act; such person shaD be danced to interfere in the occupation and use of such extent by that tenant cultivator. "

1931 However, any "interference" in the occupation and use of such extent

by the tenant as set out in section 7 (1 ) in order to induce, compel or

prevail upon the tenant cultivator to refrain from exercising any right or

privilege conferred upon 11in1 by the Agrariari Development Act would

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provind.IHigh Court (Colombo) No. HC/RAln12016

constitute an offence under section 7 (15). Section 7 (15) provides as

follows:

'~ny person who contravenes dJe plVvisions ofdus section shall be guilty of aJJ offence under dus Act; aJJd shall on conviction after

Sll/lllnaJY tnai before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceedliJg

five thousand rupees. "

1941 It seems that sections 7(1), 7(14) and 7(15) of the Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 are identical to sections 3(1), 3(14) and

3(15) of the Agricultural Lands Law No. 42 of 1973. In the case of

/(injwny v. DliJgininadJdJaya (1996) 2 Sri LR 175, the Supreme COUlt

examined the identical definition of the word "evict" and other identical

provisions in the Agricultural Lands Law No. 42 of 1973. The Supreme

Court held that die complaint of the tenant cultivator must be one of

eviction and not a threat to evict or interference in dle occupation or use or

cultivation of die paddy land, aldlOUgh such dlreat to evict or interference

may constitute an offence widlin dle meaning of dle said Act C.P.S.de

Silva, CJ. at pages 178-179 stated:

"It seems to me dJat dJe operative concept liJ the defillltion IS dJe deplivation of dJe tenaJJt cultivator's light to use, occupy aJJd cultivate dIe paddy laJJd. 77Je 'deprivation' may be by uSliJg direct or indllect medJOds. A threat to evict or mterkrence in dJe occupation aJJd use of dJe laJJd does not amount to "eviction" widJllJ dJe meaJJliJg ofdJe definition unless such inteIielence results liJ phYSIcal

dIspossession. Tlus VIew IS supported by dJe terms of section 3 (8)

wmch maRes It clear that once dJe AgIicultural 7hbunal (or the Supleme COll/fln appeal) holds dJat dJele has been all 'eviction'

dJaJJ 'the person evicted shall be entided to have dJe use aJJd occupation of such extent restored to JlIin aJJd the Tnbunal shallll]

wniing Older that evelY person Ii] occupation of such extent shall vacate it ...... ' Section 3 (8) (b) (J) fl/1d (lJ). 77Je words underlines above stlVngJy suggest physical dIspossession ....

CPA / 0027 / 2018 Provincial High Courl (Colombo) No. I IClR>\./721201 6

It seems to me tilat while sudl 'interference' IiI tile use and occupation of tile paddy land does not amount to eviction and tile remedy postulated in section 3 (3) is not aVailable to the tenant

cultiViitOJ; yet any such liltenerence would constitute all offense.

VIde-section 3(13). The matenM pm of section 3(13) enacts 'If;1J1Y person con/J<Jvenes tile provisions of til is sec/Jon he shall be guilty of

all offence' ':

1951 An identical provision of section 3 (8) of the Agricultural Land Law is

found in section 7 (7) of Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as

amended by Act No. 46 of 2011 as noted in paragraph 72 of tlus judgment

Thus, the fundamental nature of the notification to be made to tile

Comnussioner-General under section 7 (3) tile Agrarian Development Act

No. 46 of 2000 is tllat it must be one of eviction of the tenant cultivator by

depriving of Ius right to use, occupy and cultivate tile whole or any part of

tile extent of paddy land let to lum, by the use of direct or indirect

methods.

1961 The complaint referred to in section 7 (3) of the Act No. 46 of 2000

cannot be a tlrreat to evict or interference in the occupation and use of tile

paddy land. Such acts may not amount to "eviction" within the meaning of

section 7 (3) of tile Act No. 46 of 2000 unless such interference or

disturbance results in tile physical dispossession of the tenant cultivator.

(b) Complaint of Eviction made by the Petitioner

1971 The Petitioner had made tile following complaints in respect of tile

dispute between tile Petitioner and tile Respondents:

I. The first complaint dated 02.01.2000 to the Agrarian Services

Divisional Officer of the Agrarian Services Center, Homaganla

(page 43, (El.:J4 (ej!) and 142 of tile brief);

4-. The complaint of eviction dated 17.03.2001 to IDe Chairman,

5. The complaint of eviction dated 19.03.2001 to d1e Agrarian Services

Divisional Officer of the Agrarian Services Center, Homag-J.Illa (En6

(t'j!~) -page 71 of d1e brief);

6. The complaint of eviction dated 26.03.2001 to IDe Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Colombo 10 (En6 () -page 72

of d1e briet);

7. The complaint of eviction dated 30.12.2001 to IDe Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Colombo 10 (En6 (e) -page 4-9

of IDe brief);

8. The complaint of eviction dated 08.03.2002 to IDe Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Colombo 10 (En6 (e!l) -page 51

of IDe brief).

1981 The first complaint of d1e Petitioner dated 02.01.2000 had been made

to d1e Agrarian Services Divisional Officer when IDe Agrarian Services Act

No. 58 of 1979 was in operation. A pemsal of d1e first complaint made by

d1e Petitioner to IDe Agrarian Services Divisional Officer dated 01.01.2000

(page 4-3 and 14-2 of IDe brief) reveals d1at it related to (i) an initial dispute

between d1e Petitioner and d1e Respondent during a previous cultivating

season over d1e landlord's sha.re of paddy yield due to delayed fertilizer

payments made by IDe Respondent; and (ii) dIe dispute over IDe statement

made by the Respondent to refrain from cultivating die paddy land during

ilie first cultivating season of early 200 I. The relevant parts of ilie said

1991 At ilie preliminary inquiry, ilie Agrarian SeIVices Divisional Officer

had also recorded a statement from ilie Respondent and infonned die

Petitioner to make a fOlmal complaint to ilie Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian SeIVices (Vide- pages 142 of ilie brief). The Respondent's

statement to die Ah'l-arian SeIVices Divisional Officer at page 143 of die

brief reveals dlat die Respondent was insisting iliat ilie Petitioner should

have cultivated die paddy land according to ilie previously agreed

landlord's share basis and unless it is so, die Respondent did not want dIe

Petitioner to cultivate die paddy land.

11 001 It is crystal clear dlat die complaint of ilie Petitioner made to die

Agrarian SeIVices Divisional Officer dated 02.01.2000 is not a direct or

indirect eviction of die Petitioner from die paddy land in question. It

relates to a statement made by die Respondent directing die Petitioner to

refrain from cultivating ilie paddy land in question.

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. HC/R4./72120 16

11011 The learned High Court Judge has however, treated the complaint

made by the Petitioner to the Agrarian Divisional Officer on 17.03.2001

(PI) as a complaint of eviction and such complaint is not a valid complaint

made to the Commissioner-General in terms of section 7 (3) of the

AgraIian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as it was made to dIe AgraIim

11031 It is !rue that the complaint made by the Petitioner to the Agrari;U1

the eviction of the Petitioner by the Respondent by employing anodler

person to cultivate the paddy land in question. Even if it is assumed dlat

dle Agrarian Services Divisional Officer had not been expressly authorised

in terms of section 38 (6) of the Act to exercise all or any of dle powers of

the Conunissioner-General, the complaint dated 17.03.200 I was not the

only complaint of eviction made by the Petitioner.

11041 The Petitioner had made two odler complaints to the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarain Services on 17.03.2001 P 1/ V6 (~~) and on

26.03.200130.12.2001 (D.J6 () complaining that she was evicted li'om the

by employing another cultivator. The Petitioner in her complaint to the

11051 The Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services by letter dated

01.11.2002 had clearly acknowledged that the Petitioner complained to

him that she had been evicted by the Respondent from the 2001 Yala

Season and thus, he directed the Respondent to allow the Petitioner to

cultivate the paddy land from the 2002/2003 Maha Season (V4 ().

11061 Pnma /a.cie, the Petitioner had notified the Assistant Conunissioner

of Agrarian Services in wiring on 26.03.2001 (E))6 () that she was evicted

physically by the Respondent during the 2001 Yala Season. The Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services by letter dated 01.11.2002 (E))4 (0) had

entertained and notified the Petitioner that the complaint of eviction would

be inquired into upon the establishment of the Agrarian Tribunals U1

temlS of section 7 (3) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

(c) The Validity of the Complaint addressed to the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services dated 26.03.2001

11071 The remaining question under this sub-heading is whether the

complaint of eviction dated 26.03.2001 addressed to the Assistant

Commissioner is void in terms of section 7 (3) of the Agrarian

Development Act for the reason that it had not been addressed to

Commssioner-General of Agrarian Services.

11081 The submission of Mr. Suriyaarachchi was that the complaint made

to a person odler dla1l the Conunissioner-General is a nullity alld d1Us, all

CPA 10027/2018 Provinciallligh Cour, (Colombo) No. IIClR\/72/2016

subsequent steps taken are nuUities. It it is thus, necessary to consider die

void and voidable distinction in administrative law. The "void" IS a

complete nullity, it is a "non-act" incapable of generating legal

consequences as it is a nuUity from its purported inception (Edward I Sykes

& Richards RS Tracey, Cases and Materials of Adminisu-ative Law, 4dl Ed.

446).

11 091 In this context, die maxim delegatus non pot est delegare is a rule of

constlUction to die effect dlat where a statute provides that a nanled official

may do this or that, Parlianlent intends that he alone may do so and not

that anyone, else may do it It is a weU-known principle of law that when a , power has been confided to a person in circumstances indicating dlat trust

is being placed in his individual judgment and discretion, he must exercise

that power personaUy, unless he has been expressly empowered to delegate

it to anodler. (EdJiisJilghe v. CommissionerofNa(ional Housil1!J7!i . . LIt

p.273).

11101 Although die discretion conferred by statute is pnina facie intended

to be exercised by such authority alone as intended by Parlianlent, dlis

intention may be negatived by any contrary indications found in the scope

or object of the statute (S. A. de Smith, Judicial Review of Administrative

Action, 2nd Edition, p. 284). In this modem-day administration and

expansion of powers and functions exercised by public officers after die

13dl Amendment to die Constitution was introduced, die Commissioner-

General cannot be expected as die head of die administrative body to

per/orm each and evelY function llin1self. Thus, it becanle necessary that

the Legislature confers wide powers to Deputy Conmussioners and

Assistant commissioners who are appointed in various p<u1S of the counuy

for die purpose of die Act.

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provinciailligh Court (Colombo) l\o.IIC/RAlnI2016

/1111 Section 38 of dIe Act makes provision for dIe appointment of ilie

Commissioner-General, additional Commissioner-General, Deputy

Commissioner General, Conmlissioners, Assistant Commissioner and

Divisional Officers for dIe purpose of dIe Act. Section 38 (5) provides dlat

an Assistant Commissioner can exercise all or any of ilie powers of ilie

Commissioner-General under iliis Act, wiiliin ilie area to which such

Assistant Conmlissioner is appointed. Once dIe Assistant Commissioner is

expressly audlorised by the statute to exercise all or any of dIe powers of

dIe Commissioner-General, such powers can be exercised by dIe Assistant

Commissioner on behalf of ilie Commissioner-General, as audlOrised by

ilie Statute.

11121 It is significant to consider the nature of ilie decisions which are to be

required to be performed by the Commissioner-General in dIe exercise of

his individual judgment and discretion in entertaining and referring dIe

complaint to the Tribunal under section 7 (3). The Commissioner-

General is not exercising any discretion and judgment in entertaining

complaints of eviction and I do not see any such intention indicated in dIe

language, scope or object of section 7 (3) of dIe Act. All what ilie

Commissioner-General has to do under section 7 (3) is to entertain dIe

complaint of eviction and refer dIe matter to dIe Tribunal directing it to

hold an inquiry.

11131 In die circumstances, it is not necessary for dIe Conmlissioner-

General to perform all ministerial act~ of entertaining complaints

personally at his Office in Colombo when such ministerial tasks of

entertaining complaints can be performed by dIe Deputy or Assistant

Conmussioners who are appointed under die Act widUn the area to wluch

dley are appointed under section 38 (4) and 38 (5). Thus, once ilie

Assistant Commissioner is audlorised to entertain complaints of eviction in

CI'A 1002712018 Pro\'inciailligh Court (Colombo) No. IICIRAl72i2016

their respective areas, such complaints can be referred to the

Commissioner-General to be referred to the Tribunal for the purpose of

holding an inquiry as it has happened in the present case.

11141 Thus, the maxim delegatus non pot est delegare, gives way in the

perfOlTIla11Ce of administrative or ministerial tasks by subordinate officers

who aIe authorised by the staUIte itself to exercise such powers or expressly

audlOrised to do by dle delegated party, subject to dle direction and control

of dle delegated party. Thus, the powers alld duties conferred or imposed

on dle Commissioner-General under dlis Act may also be exercised by the

Deputy Commissioners or Assistant Commissioners on his behalf, subject

however, to dle direction alld control of the Commissioner-General.

Whether compliance with section 7 (3) is mandatory or directory

11151 On the odler hand, dle question arises whether the non-compliance

widl section 7 (3) is malldatory or directory, when the AssistaIlt

Commissioner is authorised by the Act to exercise all or any of dle powers

of dle Commissioner-General within the area to which he is appointed.

According to Crawford's StaUItory Construction, 3rd edn. Vol. III, p. 104:

a mandatory statute is one whose provisions or requirements, Ifnot complied witil, WID render tile proceedings to wbich it relates IDegal and void, wluJe a directOlY st1tute is one wbere non-compliance WIll not invalidate tile proceedings to whicb it relates". Crawford mrther states tilat tile basic test by wlucb to detelmine wbether tile requirement is essential or not, is to consIder tile consequeJJces of tile Failure to foUow tile statute (supra-, p. 518).

11161 Bindra's Interpretation of StaUItes, 10" edn. p 1012 refers to dle case , of MIDer v Latewood Housing Co. (932) 125 Ohio St. 152 in which dle

Ohio Court exanlined as to how a provision of a staUIte is mandatory or

directory:

CPA 10027 / 2018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. IIC/R<\I7212016

"Whedler a statutOIY reqllli-ement IS mandatOIY or directOIY depends on its e!lixt. IF no substantial rights depend on it and 110 iIYLIIY can I-eSlllt liVln ignonilg it, and die plllpose of dIe legislature can be accomplished Iii a manner odler dian dlat pres(l1bed iUld substantially the sanle l-esults obtaJiled, then die statute WIll generally be regarded as directOIy, but IFnot, it WIll be maJldatOIY':

11171 As far as an official action of public officials is concerned, Crawford

states at pages 529-531 as follows:

"As a general rule, a statute which regulates die manner Iii which public ollicials shall exercise die power Iii dIem, WIll be construed as directOIY radler dlaJ] maJldatOIy, especially whel-e SUdl l-egulation pel1;uils to ulll/onlllty, Older aJld convenience aJld neither public nor pllvate nghts WIll be liyi.I1-ed or Impaired dlel-eby. IF die statute is negative iII 101711 or IF 1l0dlJi]g is stated l-eg<lldlng die consequences or elk:ct of non-compklllce, die liJ(hcation is all die slIvnger that it should not be cOIlSJdered maJldatOIY. But IF die publIc lilterest or pllvate rights call lor die exercise of die power vested iII a public

o!licial, the laJ]guage used, dlOugiJ permissive or dli-ectory iII lonn, is In lact pel-emptOIY or maJldatory as a general rule .. "

11181 In the present case, the Act does not declare what result shall follow

in non-compliance with the requirement of not sending the complaint to

the Commissioner-General himself, whereas the Act expressly authorises

an Assistant Commissioner to exercise all or any of the powers of the

Commissioner-General. On the other hand, the non-compliance is

unlikely to injure or impair the public or private rights of third persons or

cause serious inconvenience or injustice to others or invalidate any act

performed by the Assistant Commissioner who is expressly authorised by

the Act. .

11191 In the circumstances, the failure to notify Commissioner-General is

only directOIY when the Agrarian Development Act has expressly

authorised the Assistant Conmussioner to exercise all or any of his powers

CPA 1 0027 11018 Provinciailligh Courl (Colombo) No. IIC/RAlnl2016

and such failure did not become the complaint addressed to the Assistant

Commissioner void under section 7 (3) of the Act unless somedllng in the

body of dIe Act indicates the contrary.

11201 In the circumstances, I hold that the complaint of eviction notified to

dIe Assistant Conmlissioner of Agrarian Development dated 26.03.2001 by

dIe Petitioner can constitute a valid complaint made to dIe Commissioner-

General of Agrarian Development under section 7 (3) of dIe Act read widl

section 38 (5) of dIe said Act..

Wheilier ilie complaint of eviction is prescribed under section 7 (4) of ilie Act

11211 The learned High CourtJudge has taken the view that (i) dlOugh die

alleged eviction had taken place by dIe time the Petitioner sent dIe letter

dated 17.03.20 11 (PI/V6(~~), dIe Petitioner had complained about dIe

eviction to ilie Commissioner-General under section 7 (3) of the Agrarian

Development Act only on 19.03.2015 as stated in FornI" A" (en3); (ii) die

Petitioner had informed dIe Minister of Agricultural Development of her

grievances on 09.07.2009 as evident from letter dated 28.09.2009 marked

en5(ep); (iii) dIe Petitioner had made the complaint to the Commissioner-

General 8 years after dIe date of the alleged eviction; and thus, die

Petitioner's complaint is prescribed in terms of section 7 (4) of dIe AgraJian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as ;unended by Act 10 . 46 of 200 1.

11221 As noted, the complaint of eviction had been made to the AssistaJlt

Comnlissioner on 26.03.2001 stating dlat dIe Petitioner had been evicted

by the Respondent from ilie first cultivating season of early 2001 widl dIe

assistaJlce of aJlodler cultivator. The Assistant Commissioner has

acknowledged in his letters dated 03.05.2002 (en4 (<g aJld 01.11.2002 (en4

(0) dlat dIe Petitioner had made a complaint of eviction. By letter dated

05.06.2002 (en5 (~), dIe Assistant Conmllssioner has stated dlat the

C1'A 10027 12018 Provincial High Court (Colombo) No. HC/RA/7212016

eviction of a tenant cultivator has to be referred to the Agrarian Tribunals

under section 7 (3) of Act No. 46 of 2011 and accordingly, the complaint

will be dealt widl after the establishment of the Agrarian tribunals.

11231 The eviction as per the letter dated 26.03.2001 marked eJ.j6(c&J), had

taken place during dIe fIrst cultivating season in early 2001 and the

complaint of eviction had been made on 26.03.2001 and hence, the said

complaint of eviction is well widlin dIe prescribed period of 6 mondls from

dIe date or period of eviction which had taken place during the fU'st

cultivating season of early 2011.

11241 After die Assistant Commissioner entertained the complaint of dIe

Petitioner dated 26.03.200 I, die complaint should have been referred to

dIe Tribunal in tenTIS of section 7 (3) of dIe Act. In dIe meantime, dIe

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2010 was anlended by dIe Agrarian

Development (Amendment) Act No. 46 of 2011 which came into

operation on 22.11.2011, long after the complaint of eviction was

addressed to the Assistant Commissioner on 26.03.2001. There was no

prescribed fonn of complaint to be made togedler widl an affidavit other

dIan to make the complaint in writing under section 7 (3) of the Act No. 46

of 20 11. Yet, dIe Tribunals were not established as set out in dIe letter of

dIe Assistant Commissioner dated 05.06.2002 (eJ.j5 (!'I!).

11251 The Minister in Charge of Economic Development promulgated

Agr,uian Development (Inquiry Procedure) Regulations No.1 of 2013 by

Gazette Extraordinary, dated 05.03.2011. The said Regulations inter aiia,

mandated that an application or complaint made or referred to dIe

A!,'TaJian Tribunal shall be substantially in Fonn "A" set out 1Il dIe

Schedule thereto and shall be accompanied by an alftdavit. However, the

Agrarian Tribunals, were not established even alter dIe promulgation of

2013 Rules as the MinisllY was making amlllgements to repeal die Act No.

46 of 2000 and introduce a brand new Act to address the issues that have

arisen in the agricultural sector. This is evident from the letter of the

Additional SecretaIY, Ministry of Agriculture Development dated

28.09.2009 (en5 (ep).

11 261 As the Tribunals were not established under the Act, the Petitioner

had flied an action 111 the District Court on 11.11.2002 seeking a

declaI'ation that she IS the tenaIlt cultivator and ejectment of dIe

Respondent The said case was dismissed on 06.05.2005 as the District

Court had no jurisdiction to decide dIe question of tenancy rights of tenaIlt

cultivators (en4 (e) - en4 (el).

11271 The Petitioner had dlUs, submitted a complaint dated 19.05.2015

substantially in Form" A" (en3 at page 42, 166 of dIe brieO togedler widl

ail affidavit dated 18.03.2015 (page 165 of the brieO as set out in die

Schedule to dIe Regulations dated 15.03.2013, merely to comply widl dIe

two requirements set out in rule 3 (I) of Agrarian Development (Inquiry

Procedure) Regulations No.1 of 2013. The words"ex@3~ ~1:Wl

m" on dIe top of dIe application dated 19.03.2015 (page 166 of the

brieO clearly indicate that it was submitted to comply widl the said Rules

3(1) published by die Minister, long after the complaint dated 26.03.20 II

was addressed to the Assistant Commissioner. The inquiry conmlenced in

2015 after the establishment of the Tribunals and the formalities 111

compliance with dIe said Rule 3 (I) were fulfilled by the Petitioner.

11281 Hence, dIe Petitioner carmot be penalized for for administrative

delays on the PaIt of dIe Conmlissioner-General of AgraI'iaIl Services in

establishing AgrariaIl Tribunals when dIe formalities set out in Rule 3 (I) of

the Regulations were non-existent when dIe complaint of eviction was

made by the Petitioner on 26.03.2001. The leamed High Court Judge has

erred in calculating dIe prescriptive period from dIe date of dIe formal

complaint made on 19.03.2015 by tlle Petitioner to comply witll tlle

requirements set out in Rule 3 (I) of Regulations dated 15.03.2013

disregarding tlle fact mat tllOse Rules were non-existent when tlle Petitioner

made me complaint of eviction on 26.03.2001.

[1291 The leamed High Court Judge has clearly erred 111 holding mat

altllOugh me eviction had taken place on 17.03.2001 (P l /en6({1!~), tlle

complaint of eviction had been made to tlle Commissioner-General on

19.03.2015 (en3) and tllerefore, me complaint of eviction made to me

Commissioner-General is out of time under section 7 (4) of me Act.

11301 I hold tllat the Petitioner's complaint of eviction dated 26.03.2001 is

well witllin me prescribed period of 6 monms from tlle date of tlle eviction,

which according to tlle Petitioner had taken place in tlle first cultivating

season in 20 II

Delay in filing the Revision Application

11311 Mr. Suriyaararchchi complained mat tlle Petitioner filed tlus

application in tlle Court of Appeal after a lapse of 10 monms from me

order of me High Court and me reason given by me Petitioner for me

delay, namely tllat she filed a Leave to Appeal Application in me Supreme

is not a valid reason. The question whemer me delay is fatal to an

application in revision depends on tlle facts and circumstances of the case.

In mis context, it is appropriate to quote from His Lordship fonner Chief

Justice G.P.S. De Silva, in tlle case of Cnanapa.l1dithan v. Balanayagam

(1998) I Sri LR a91, where he held

'77Ie question whether dJe delay is fatal to an application liJ revision depends on dJe lacts and circumstances of dJe case. Having regard to dJe velY special and exceptional circumstances of dJe case, the appellants were entJded to dJe exenise of dJe revisionaIY paIties of dJe COUlt of Appeal. "

CPA i 0027 i 2018 Provincial l1igh Court (Colombo) "'0. HCiRAi72i2016

11321 It is settled law that if the impugned order or part thereof is

manifestly erroneous and is likely to cause grave injustice, tile court should

not reject tile application on tile ground of delay alone (Caroline Nona ;/IJd

OdJeT.5 v. Fedrick Slilgho and Odlers (2005) 3 Sri LR 176). In the case of

Eiso Menike Vs. Cyril de AiWlS 1982 I Sri LR 368, Sharvananda, J. (as he

tllen was) at 379 observed:

"When dIe COUlt has examined dIe record and IS sal1slied dIe order complaIiled oI IS J11aIJiIesdy elToneous or WldlOut junsdicil"on dIe Court would be loadle to aJJow dIe mis(weIoIdIe order to conl1iwe ,wd reject dIe applical10n simply on dIe gJvund oI delay, unless dlere aIe veIY extraordinaJY reasons to jusl1fjt such rejecl1oIJ.

11331 The order of the learned High Court Judge was made on

05.04.2017. This revision application has been made to tllis Court on

16.02.2018. The Petitioner had made a Leave to Appeal Application to tile

Supreme Court against the said order dated 05.04.2017, but tile said

application was withdrawn to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of tllis

Court as tile Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from the

orders of the Provincial High Court made in tile exercise of revisionaJ)'

jurisdiction. The Petitioner has clearly explained the reasons for tile delay

in preferring this application to dlis Court.

11341 Article 138 of tile Constitution has confelTed revisionaJ)' jurisdiction

on tile Court of Appeal to make necessary orders as may be necessary for

tile ends of justice where a miscarriage of justice has occUlTed. The

Petitioner has pleaded md satisfied that exceptional circumstaJ1ces exist

which would invite this Court to exercise its powers in revision. As noted,

tile Petitioner has satisfied tllat the impugned order is maJillestly erroneous

I

and caused a miscarriage of justice that has deplived the Petitioner of her

right to be heard by the Agrarian Tribunal in respect of her eviction from

the paddy land in question.

11351 The Petitioner has further satisfied dlat die impugned order has

caused a manifest miscarriage of justice when she had been penalized for

die administrative delays on die part of the Conmlissioner-Gener.u in not

establishing Agrarian Tribunals and die High Court had erroneously

calculated die prescriptive period from die date of a formal complaint

made by her in compliance with Rules promulgated long after die

compla.int of eviction was entertained.

Conclusion

11361 For dIOse reasons, the judgment of die learned High CourtJudge of

die Western Province holden in Colombo dated 05.04.2017 is set aside

and die relief prayed for in paragraph (c) of die prayer to die Petition of
