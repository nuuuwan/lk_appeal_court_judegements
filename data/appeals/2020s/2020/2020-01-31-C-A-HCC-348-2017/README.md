Hon. Justice Achala Wengappuli,

Learned President's Counsel for the Accused-Appellant confines his appeal

only to the question of sentence and submits to this Court that there is no act

committed by the Accused-Appellant as per the evidence revealed from the

prosecution's case. The Accused-Appellant wa;s initially charged along with two

other Accused for committing a murder. However, after trial the learned High

Court Judge had convicted all three accused only for causing hurt and were

punished the Accused with imposition of 3 years Rigorous Imprisonment.

Learned Senior State Counsel who resists the application of the learned

President's Counsel for reduction of sentence, submits to Court that although

there is no positive act by the Accused-Appellant, there was evidence of

supplying a piece of rope to the 151 and 2nd Accused who took a very active role

in inflicting the 32 injuries that were found on the body of the deceased.

Learned President's Counsel for the Accused-Appellant highlights that this

item if evidence has been contradicted by another witness \!Vho says it was the

1 st and the 2nd Accused-Appellants who fetched a piece of rope.

Having considered the submissions and the basis of conviction and

sentence of the learned High Court Judge, we are of the opinion that justice

would be met, if the sentence imposed on the 3rd Accused-Appellant is reduced

to 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment, suspended for a period of 10 years,

Therefore, conviction of the 3rd Accused-Appellant is affirmed. His

sentence is reduced to 02 years imprisonment suspended for a period of 10

years.

The relevant High Court is directed to comply with Section 303 of the

Criminal Procedure Act in explaining the effect of the suspended term.

Hon. Justice Devika Abeyratne I agree.
