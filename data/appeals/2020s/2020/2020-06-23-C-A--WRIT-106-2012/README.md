Janak De Silva J.

The 1st Respondent made an application to the Land Redemption Department of the 2nd

Respondent under and in terms of the provisions of the Finance Act No. 11 of 1963 as amended

(Finance Act) for the redemption of the land described therein as Mahalindawatte.

The 3rd Respondent was appointed by the 2nd Respondent to conduct an inquiry into the said

application. The inquiry was conducted with the participation of the Petitioners and the 1st

Respondent. At the conclusion of the inquiry the 3rd Respondent made a recommendation (Y4)

to the Board of Directors of the 2nd Respondent that the land forming the subject matter of this

application be acquired in terms of the Finance Act.

The Petitioners are seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the said "order" made by the 3rd

Respondent (Y4) and a writ of prohibition prohibiting the 2nd Respondent from vesting in it the

said land called Mahalindawatte as more fully described in P1.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents have raised the following preliminary objections:

(1) The application is futile, inasmuch as the relief sought for in this application does not

finally adjudicate the rights of the Petitioners and dispose the matter in relation to the

redemption of the land and premises forming the subject matter of this application.

(2) The writ of certiorari sought in this application is not against a determination, but only

against a recommendation, which is not subject to the writ jurisdiction.

(3) The Petitioners have failed to bring before Court necessary parties for the adjudication

and the granting of the substantive reliefs prayed for in the petition.

I will address the first and second objections first but not in the same order.

The legal provisions governing land redemption by the 2nd Respondent Peoples Bank is

contained in Part VIII of the Finance Act and the same provisions are also contained in the

People's Bank (Acquisition of Premises) Act, which is a reproduction of sections 69 to 98 of the

Finance Act.

Section 71(3) of the Finance Act clearly states that it is the 2nd Respondent Bank which is

authorized to determine whether to acquire the whole or any part of any agricultural,

residential or business premises. Hence it is clear, that the final decision as to whether the land

forming the subject matter of this application must be acquired or not is with the 2nd

Respondent Bank.

Several previous judicial decisions have recognized that it is the Peoples Bank that is authorized

to make this determination [Munasinghe v. People's Bank (73 N.L.R. 385), Perera v. People's

Bank (1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 39, Fernando v. IIlukkumbura and Another (1987) 2 Sri.L.R. 8).

Yet the Petitioner contends that section 3A of the Finance Act, which was brought in by Act No.

11 of 1963 requires the holding of an inquiry and that the inquiry in this case conducted by the

3,d Respondent is a statutory inquiry and the report Y4 affects the proprietary rights of the

Petitioners and as such is liable to be quashed by a writ of certiorari.

Lord Atkin in R. v. Electricity Commissioner ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee

Company Ltd. [(1924) 1 KB 171 at 205) held:

"Wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions offecting

the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their legal

authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's Bench Division

exercised in these Writs". (Emphasis added)

Page 3 of6

In my view, Lord Atkin's formulation is still a good benchmark in deciding whether certiorari lies

although the phrase "affecting the rights" has been liberalized so that they need not be legally

enforceable rights but a step as a resu lt of which legally enforceable rights may be affected [R.

v. Liverpool Corporation ex parte Taxi Fleet Operators Association [(1972) 2 Q.B. 299, R. v.

Criminal Injuries Compensation Board ex parte Lain (1967) 2 AII.E.R. 770 at 777-778), In Re.

Pergamon Press Ltd. (1970) 3 AII.E.R. 535 at 539].

There is a long line of judicial authority which unequivocally states that a writ of certiorari will

issue only where the decision-maker has determined questions affecting the rights of the

subject and will not issue against recommendations that do not have any force praprio vigore.

[De Mel v. De Silva (51 N.L.R. 105), Dias v. Abeywardena (68 N.L.R. 409), Fernando v. Jayaratne

(78 N.L.R. 123), G.P.A. Silva and Others v. Sadique and Others [(1978-79) 1 Sri.L.R. 166].

However there has been a shift in judicial thinking on this area.

It is now sufficient if the recommendation or decision of the authority has the effect of

potentially jeopardizing the rights of persons. The fact that the recommendation does not

affect the rights of a person proprio vigore or that a decision must be made by another

authority after considering the recommendation does not necessarily preclude judicial review.

According to Article 140 of the Constitution this Court must exercise judicial review according

to law which has been held by judicial decisions to mean English common law.

In England a patient may be not detained in a hospital for medical treatment under the Mental

Health Act 1983 unless there are written recommendations from two doctors. The

recommendations may be reviewed to ensure that the statutory criteria have been properly

observed [R. v. Hal/strom Ex.p. W. (1986) Q.B. 1090]. Similarly a person convicted of a crime

becomes liable for deportation if the court makes a recommendation to that effect. These

recommendations are reviewable even though the Home Secretary is not obliged to implement

them and even though other grounds for deportation may exist [R. v. Secretary of State for the

Environment Ex. p. North Herfordshire DC (1989) H.L.R. 588].

In the present case, the Finance Act requires the 2nd Respondent Bank to cause an inquiry to be

held for the purpose of making a determination to ascertain whether the statutory

requirements are met. Where the inquiring officer makes any error of law in that inquiry, courts

will be more inclined to grant judicial review. Therefore, I reject the contention advanced on

behalf of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents that the "recommendation" of the 3rd Respondent is not

subject to judicial review. If the Petitioner can establish any illegality, unreasonableness or

procedural impropriety in the recommendation, I would have been inclined to exercise judicial

review.

However, I need not venture into that examination in view of the first preliminary objection

that has been raised namely that this application is futile.

This objection is based on the fact that the Board of Directors of the 2nd Respondent, having

considered the recommendation made by the 3rd Respondent (Y4) made a determination

accepting the recommendation of the 3rd Respondent.

The Petitioner has failed to challenge this determination in this application. It is true that when

the Petitioners came to Court no such determination had been made. But it was made after the

Court allowed the 2nd Respondent to do so on 11.02.2014. Thereafter the Petitioners moved to

amend the petition to plead these facts which was refused by a previous bench.

Thereafter, the Petitioners have filed a fresh application bearing no. CA (Writ) 117/2015.

However, even in that application the Petitioners have not sought a quashing of the

determination made by the Board of Directors of the 2nd Respondent so that even if a writ of

certiorari is issued quashing the recommendation made by the 3rd Respondent, the

determination made by the 2nd Respondent survives. The accepted view is that no

administrative order bears the seal of invalidity on its forehead and that it is valid until declared

invalid by a court of law [Lord Radcliffe in Smith v. East Ellae Rural District Council (1956) A.C.

736,769-770, Lord Diplock in F Hoffmann-La Roch and C AG v. Secretary for Trade and Industry

(1975) AC 295 at 366, Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and

Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4,

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 281].

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner cited Sideek v. Jaca/yn Seneviratne and Others

[(1984) 1 Sri.L.R. 83] where the petitioner sought to quash two subsequent orders of the Rent

Board without quashing the first erroneous order of the Rent Board and Soza J. held inter alia

that a writ of certiorari will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile.

I hold that the application of the Petitioners is futile as they have failed to assail the

determination made by the Board of Directors of the 2nd Respondent.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application of the Petitioner is dismissed without costs.
