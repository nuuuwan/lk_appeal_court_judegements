Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiffs filed this action against the Defendant in the

District Court of Kegalle on 10.02.1972, seeking a declaration of

title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint,

ejectment of the Defendant therefrom and damages. The

Defendant filed the answer seeking dismissal of the action. After

the trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the action. Hence

this appeal by the Plaintiffs.

The land the Plaintiffs claim title to is depicted in the Plan

marked X at the trial. According to the superimposition on this

Plan, two other lands, which were each the subject matter of two

previous cases, have been included in the corpus of this case.

The superimposed Plan is marked Y. One portion in the Plan

marked Y has been identified as part of Plan No.2831, which is

the final partition plan in the District Court of Kegalle Case No.

2126. The other portion has been identified as part of Plan

No.279, which is the plan prepared for Case No. 18913 in the

same Court.

Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellants accepts that these

two lands cannot form part of the corpus in the instant matter

and therefore shall be excluded. Then, what is left is a very

small portion of land.

On this ground alone, learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs candidly

admits the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action, which is a rei

vindicatio action, is correct.

However, learned Counsel says the answers given by the District

Judge in favour of the Defendant with regard to the issues

relating to prescription are not justifiable, as the Defendant has

also been identified as a co-owner of the land along with the

Plaintiffs. Hence, Counsel submits the said answers be

amended to say the Defendant has not acquired prescriptive

rights to the land, in order to enable the Plaintiffs to file a

partition action to claim their undivided rights to the land.

The Plaintiffs in paragraph 7 of the plaint (dated 10.02.1972) say

the Defendant came to the land as a watcher and, thereafter,

from around 15.10.1962 has been in forcible possession of the

land. The Defendant does not admit he came to the land as a

watcher. Even assuming the Plaintiffs are correct, this means

the Defendant has been in prescriptive possession of the land

since 15.10.1962.

It is not clear from the plaint or from the evidence led at the trial

why the Plaintiffs specify 15.10.1962 as the date on which the

Defendant commenced adverse possession. It seems to me the

said date was given to ensure that at the time of filing the action

the Defendant was a few months short of the requisite 10-year

period to claim prescriptive title in terms of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

If I may advert to the evidence of the first witness for the

Plaintiffs, this witness himself (at page 206 of the Brief and

thereafter) admits that the Defendant has been on the land since

at least 1958. The witness first says (at page 185 of the Brief)

forcible possession by the Defendant commenced in mid-1962.

4

Thereafter, the witness says (at page 194 of the Brief) he made a

mistake on the previous occasion and in fact forcible possession

by the Defendant commenced on 15.10.1962. However, the

witness does not offer a reason for specifying such a date. It is

interesting to note that if the Defendant had commenced adverse

possession on 09.02.1962, for instance, he would have

completed the 10-year prescriptive period by the time the action

was instituted in Court.

Without offering an explanation for the basis upon which the

Plaintiffs say the Defendant commenced adverse possession of

the land, the specific date mentioned in the plaint is misleading

and intended to thwart any attempt on the part of the Defendant

to claim the land on prescriptive possession, which he would

have been entitled to do had the date of his commencement of

adverse possession been a mere eight and a half months prior to

that claimed by the Plaintiffs.

The second witness for the Plaintiffs first says the Defendant has

been on the land since 1959 (at page 219 of the Brief) and later

changes this to 1957 (at page 229 of the Brief).

In line with paragraph 7 of the plaint, the Plaintiffs had raised

issue No.5 to say the Defendant commenced prescriptive

possession on 15.10.1962. The District Judge answered this

issue in the negative.

The Defendant had raised issue Nos. 26 and 29 to say he has

acquired prescriptive rights to the land, having been in adverse

possession for well over 10 years. The District Judge answered

these two issues in the affirmative.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I see no compelling

reason to disturb this finding of the District Judge.

I dismiss the appeal with costs.
