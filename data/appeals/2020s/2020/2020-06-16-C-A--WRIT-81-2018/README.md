Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for all

parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions tendered on behalf of the parties. This Court thereafter directed

the parties to clarify certain matters that had arisen from the pleadings, which

was duly complied by way of further written submissions.

The Petitioners complaint to this Court is that the recommendation of the 1st

4th Respondents to issue to the husband of the 6th Respondent a Grant in terms

of the Land Development Ordinance is contrary to the provisions of such

Ordinance, and is ultra vires the powers conferred on the 1st 4th Respondents

by the said Ordinance.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The State had issued Annual Permit No. 373 dated 14th March 1946 to

W.M.Kapilaratne. Although a copy of the permit has not been produced, it

appears that the said permit was in respect of a paddy land in extent of 1A 2R,

which formed part of Plan No. 516. It is not in dispute that this land is the

subject matter of this application.

By a notice issued by the Assistant Commissioner of Lands, Polonnaruwa under

Section 106(1) of the Land Development Ordinance1, annexed to the petition

marked P3, Kapilaratne had been informed as follows: Tn i;= 1A 2R uv bvu

ixjraOkh fkdlsrSu iy w;yerhdu mrSCIK j,oS fy,sjS ;sfnk fyhska bvus

1 Section 106 of the Ordinance has been repealed and replaced by Section 7 of the Land Development (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1993.

It appears that Kapilaratne had not complied with the above notice and that an

inquiry in terms of Section 110(1)2 of the Ordinance had been scheduled for

12th October 1982. However, as Kapilaratne had not presented himself at the

inquiry, the Assistant Commissioner of Lands, Polonnaruwa had cancelled the

aforementioned Permit No. 373, by his directive dated 10th November 1982

issued under Section 109(1) of the Ordinance. The said directive has been

annexed to the petition marked P2.

The 1st Petitioner states that he was issued an Annual Permit No. 716/36 in

respect of the above land on 31st December 1982. A copy of the said permit

has been annexed to the petition marked P1. Although P1 does not have a

lot number, it is not in dispute that this land is now identified as Lot No. 53,

and is the subject matter of this application.

The 1st Respondent has produced together with the written submissions dated

7th February 2020 filed in response to the clarifications sought by this Court, a

letter dated 5th October 1983 marked R1, which explains the steps that had

been taken after Permit No. 373 was cancelled in November 1982.

The said letter reads as follows:

2 Section 110(1) reads as follows: If on the date and at the time and place specified in a notice issued under section 106 or appointed by the Government Agent under section 109 (2) the permit-holder appears and offers to show cause why his permit should not be cancelled, the Government Agent may, if he is satisfied after inquiry that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the permit, make order cancelling the permit.

According to R1, the beneficiaries that are referred to in R1 include (a) the

1st Petitioner, (b) the father of the Petitioners, i.e. M.M.Wijeratne, and (c)

R.M.Padmawathie, who is the mother of the Petitioners. Accordingly, in

addition to the permit issued to the 1st Petitioner, the State had issued

M.M.Wijeratne a permit bearing No. 716/37 in respect of a land which is said

to be in extent of 2 acres. When one considers the fact that the western

boundary of Lot No. 53 is the land occupied by Wijeratne, it becomes clear that

the said land given to the 1st Petitioner and the land given to his father are

contiguous lots.

The Petitioners have brought to the attention of this Court that Kapilaratne

had filed Case No. 2699 in the District Court of Polonaruwa in November 1983,

seeking to eject Wijeratne from the land that is the subject matter of this

application. This Court has examined the plaint3 and observes that Kapilaratne

has admitted that he permitted Wijeratne to occupy and cultivate the said land

3 A copy of the plaint has been annexed to the petition marked P8.

6

in 1976, but that Wijeratne had refused to hand over the property, culminating

in the District Court action. While the filing of the District Court action confirms

that Kapilaratne was not in occupation of the said land, the factual matters set

out in the aforementioned letter marked R1 are thus confirmed by the

averments in the plaint filed by Kapilaratne.

The 1st Petitioner states that he paid the annual tax in respect of the land given

to him by P1, and that the annual permit has been extended. The Petitioners

have produced receipts marked P9E, P9G and P9X to support their position

that the annual permit issued to the 1st Petitioner has been extended. The 1st

Respondent has however denied this position, and has stated that the annual

permit issued to the 1st Petitioner has not been extended, since being issued in

1982. The position of the 1st Respondent appears to be correct, for the reason

that the receipts relied upon by the Petitioners, namely P9E, P9G and P9X

are in respect of Permit No. 716/37, which is the number of the permit issued

to M.M. Wijeratne.

The Petitioners have produced together with their written submissions dated

17th January 2020, filed in response to the clarifications sought by this Court, a

letter dated 16th December 2019 marked Y1 written by the 2nd Petitioner to

the 4th Respondent, Divisional Secretary, Hingurakgoda, where he confirms the

following:

Thus, the averment in paragraph 1 of the petition that the 1st Petitioner is the

occupier of the paddy land under the Annual Permit P1 is factually incorrect.

The correct position thus appears to be that the land given to the 1st Petitioner

under Permit No. 716/36 is currently being cultivated by the 2nd Petitioner,

namely M.M.Sarath Wijebandara. This is in addition to cultivating the adjoining

land given to M.M.Wijeratne, the father of the Petitioners under Permit No.

716/37.

The Petitioners state that while they were cultivating the said land, and

unknown to them, His Excellency the President had issued W.M.Kapilaratne,

who is the son of the holder of Permit No. 373, a Grant dated 12th January

1994 in terms of Section 19(4) of the Ordinance, read together with Section

19(6) thereof. A copy of the said grant has been annexed to the petition

marked P4. It is an admitted fact that even though P4 describes the said land

as a high land, the grant has been issued in respect of Lot No. 53, which is the

paddy land that had been given to the 1st Petitioner by P1. Upon the death of

the grantee, his wife, the 6th Respondent has succeeded to the said land, as

confirmed by letter dated 23rd August 2013 issued by the 4th Respondent.

Aggrieved by the decision of the State to issue P4 while the land is occupied

and cultivated by the Petitioners on a permit issued by the State, the

Petitioners filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the recommendation made by the 1st 4th

Respondents to HE the President to issue P4;

8

b) A Writ of Mandamus to direct the Hon. Attorney General to conduct

necessary inquiries and make a suitable recommendation to quash P4.

This Court must observe that this application has been filed 24 years after the

Grant P4 had been issued, and that the 6th Respondent has taken up the

position that the Petitioners are guilty of laches. The position of the Petitioners

is that they have been in occupation of the said land since 1982, and was not

aware of the Grant, until the 6th Respondent instituted Case No. 158/L in 2017

in the District Court of Hingurakgoda, seeking a declaration of title in respect of

the said land and to eject the father of the Petitioners from the said land. This

explanation is plausible, especially since the 6th Respondent has not placed any

material before this Court that the existence of the Grant was divulged to the

Petitioners any time prior to 2017.

In Ramasamy vs Ceylon State Mortgage Bank,4 the Supreme Court, having

considered the issue of laches, held that, The principles of laches must, in my

view, be applied carefully and discriminatingly and not automatically and as a

mere mechanical device.

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis and others,5 Sharvananda, J (as he then was)

having set out the rationale for the proposition that the application for a Writ

must be sought as soon as injury is caused, went on to consider if an

application for a writ should be dismissed on account of delay where the act

complained of is an illegality, and held as follows:

4 78 NLR 510; Wanasundera, J with Tennekoon C.J and Thamotheram, J agreeing. 5[1982] 1 Sri LR 368; at page 379. This case has been followed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon Petroleum Corporation v. Kaluarachchi and Others [SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019].

9

When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court

would be loathe to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject

the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there are very

extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Where the authority

concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court

may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows

that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event,

the explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically.

(emphasis added)

The Supreme Court, in Ramasamy as well as in Biso Menikas case, referred to

the following passage from Lindsey Petroleum Co., Vs. Hurd6:

Two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the

delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which might

affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the

one course or the other, so far as related to the remedy.

Thus, when determining whether an application should be dismissed on

account of delay on the part of a petitioner, Court can consider if the act

complained of is manifestly illegal, and the nature of the acts that have taken

place during the time period between the impugned decision or act and the

filing of the application.

This Court, having carefully considered the above factual material, is satisfied

that the permit issued in 1946 to Kapilaratne has been cancelled in November

6 (1874) L.R., 5 P.C 221 at 239, as referred to in Biso Menikas case (supra) at page 378.

10

1982, and that the State had soon thereafter issued an annual permit to the 1st

Petitioner in respect of the land that was the subject matter of Permit No. 373.

Even if this Court accepts the position of the 1st Respondent that the said

annual permit has not been extended, the fact of the matter is that the said

land had been occupied by the 1st and/or 2nd Petitioners since 1982, the

Petitioners have cultivated and developed the said land, and that even as at

now, the 2nd Petitioner is in occupation of the said land. It is also not in dispute

that even though the Grant P4 had been issued, Kapilaratne or his wife has

not been in possession of the said land hence the necessity to file the

aforementioned actions in the District Court.

Section 19(1) of the Ordinance specifies that, Alienation of State land to any

person under the provisions of this Ordinance shall be effected in the manner

hereinafter provided. In terms of Section 19(2) of the Ordinance, every such

person shall, in the first instance receive a permit authorizing him to occupy

the land. In terms of Section 19(4) of the Ordinance, a permit holder shall be

issued a Grant in respect of the land of which he is in occupation where he

satisfies the State inter alia that he has been in occupation of, and where the

land is irrigated land, has fully developed such land for a period of three years.

The evidence that is available to this Court i.e. P2 - is that Permit No. 373

was cancelled not only due to the failure on the part of the permit holder to

develop the said land but also because the permit holder had abandoned the

land. Thus, there was no valid permit in favour of Kapilaratne at the time the

Grant was issued, which is a pre-condition in terms of Section 19(4) of the

Ordinance for the issuance of a Grant. Furthermore, there is no evidence

before this Court (a) that Kapilaratne, his son or the 6th Respondent entered

11

the land after the permit was cancelled, or (b) that Kapilaratne developed the

said land, or (c) that the cancellation of the permit was subsequently revoked.

The evidence in fact is to the contrary. Thus, it is clear that the 1st 4th

Respondents could not have recommended the issuance of a Grant to

Kapilaratne, and therefore it is the view of this Court that the issuing of the

Grant P4 is contrary to the provisions of the Ordinance.

In response to the clarifications called for by this Court, the learned State

Counsel has submitted that:

(a) the Grant P4 has been issued on submission of erroneous information;

(b) there is no legal basis to issue a Grant on the strength of the permit issued

to Kapilaratne; and

(c) the Grant P4 is not legally valid.

The learned State Counsel has therefore quite correctly submitted that the

issuing of P4 is contrary to law.

The plea of laches raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 6th

Respondent cannot therefore be applied in this case in view of the illegal and

ultra vires actions of the 1st 4th Respondents. Furthermore, no prejudice has

been caused to the 6th Respondent by the delay as the 6th Respondent or her

husband have not been in possession of the disputed land, and/or developed

the said land.

12

This Court must state that for a Writ of Certiorari to issue, the impugned

decision must be before Court. In this case, that would be the

recommendation made by the 1st 4th Respondents that Kapilaratne be issued

a Grant. The above submission of the learned State Counsel that the Grant P4

had been issued based on incorrect information confirms the existence of a

recommendation. Furthermore, even though the said recommendation is not

before this Court, there is no dispute that HE the President would not have

issued the Grant P4 in the absence of the recommendations of the 1st 4th

Respondents. This Court is therefore satisfied that there in fact exists such a

recommendation.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

recommendation that was made by the 1st 4th Respondents to issue the

Grant P4. The 1st Respondent shall bring to the attention of HE the President,

the findings of this Court to enable appropriate action to be taken in respect of

P4.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
