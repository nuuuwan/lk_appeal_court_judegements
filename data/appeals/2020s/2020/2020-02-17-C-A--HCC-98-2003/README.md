01 . Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw on one count of murder punishable under

section 296 of the Penal Code and one count of attempted murder punishable under section

300 of the Penal Code. After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant on

both counts. The Appellant was sentenced to death for count No.1 and was sentenced to 10

years imprisonment and a Rs. 5,0001- fine for count No.2. The instant appeal was preferred

against the said conviction. Following grounds of appeal were urged by the counsel for the

Appellant in his written submissions.

1. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider weaknesses in the testimony of Baby

Nona.

2. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the weaknesses in the testimony of

Anusha Nimali.

3. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the adequacy of light to facilitate

identification of the person who shot applying Turnbull principles, specially

having regard to the failure of the police to take charge of the lamp.

4. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider that the prosecution failed to lead in

evidence the sketch drawn by the OIC of the Anamaduwa Police Station, IP

Indram when he gave evidence.

2

5. The learned Trial Judge in her Judgment at page 274 held that either Anusha

Nimali (PWI) or Baby Nona (PW2) should have had the ability to identify the

Accused Appellant, thereby misdirecting herself on the law.

6. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider whether the animosity or the

displeasure that the Accused Appellant had with the deceased, (vide pages 35-36,

106, 155 and 123 of the brief) paved the way for false implication of the Accused

Appellant.

7. The learned Trial Judge failed to separately consider the two counts set out in the

indictment.

8. The learned Trial Judge considered the bad character of the Accused. (vide page

282)

9. The learned Trial Judge misdirected herself on the law pertaining to the burden of

proof that an Accused Appellant should discharge in a case of this nature by

holding that the Accused had not established that the shooting was carried out by

an unknown gunman. (vide page 272)

10. The learned Trial Judge fai led to properly discharge the burden caused on her to

properly analyze the evidence led in the case for the Judgment does not contain an

analytical examination of the evidence led at the trial.

02. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, the judgment of the learned

High Court Judge and the submissions made by the counsel for the Appellant as well as the

Respondent.

03. Brief facts of the case as narrated by the witnesses for the prosecution are, that the deceased

and the wife (PW2) were living with their 3 children in their house where the shooting

incident took place. The incident had taken place around 7.30 p.m. According to PW2, the

three children had been serving their food in the kitchen that was outside close to the main

house. Deceased and PW2 had been in the room inside the house that was close to the kitchen

3

having their dinner. PW2 heard a gunshot and when she looked at the door, she had seen the

Appellant standing near the door holding a gun. Deceased had fallen on to the bed, bleeding.

Deceased had then shot at her inj uring her arm.

Ground of Appeal No.1

04. Learned President's counsel for the Appellant submitted that in her evidence in the non-

summary inquiry Baby Nona (PW2) has said that she did not see properly who shot at her

husband. Contradiction was marked as V I. Baby Nona's evidence had been very clear and

consistent. She had been having dinner facing the back-door. As she heard the gunshot, she

had looked at the back-door side where she saw the Appellant holding the gun. Then the

Appellant had shot at her as well. The evidence makes it clear that when she saw the

Appellant, the husband was already shot at. Appellant had been holding the gun. It is obvious

that it was the reason why she said in the non-summary inquiry that she did not see the

Appellant firing the shot at the husband. That portion of evidence or the contradiction V I will

not affect the credibility of the witness Baby Nona. Counsel has made the witness confused

by unfair way of cross examination.

05. Contradictions inter se as well as per se should not be considered to discredit a witness unless

those are materials that go to the root of the case. Indian Supreme Court in State of Uttar

Pradesh V. M. K. Anthony f1984J SCJ 236/ [1985J CR1. LJ. 493 at 498/499 held;

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears (0 have ring of

truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court

to scrutinize (he evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate

them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given

by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as

to render it unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences

torn out of context here and there from evidence, attaching importance to

some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the

4

root of the mailer would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a

whole. If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the

opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by

the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to allach

due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless there

are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the

evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the mailer of

trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details

unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals. "

06. This was referred to and followed in case of Oliver Dayallallda Ka/allsuriya V. Republic of

Sri Lallka CA 2812009 (13.02.2013).

07. Learned President's counsel referred to some inconsistencies between the evidence of Baby

Nona and her daughter Thushari (PW3) on the issue of meeting Thushari (PW3) who was in

the kitchen after the incident. Evidence taken as a whole makes it clear that Baby Nona was

in the room inside the main house close to the kitchen and the three children had been in the

kitchen. Witnesses cannot be expected to narrate the incident like replaying a video

recording. Evidence taken together makes it clear that Baby Nona witnessed the incident as

she testified. She also was shot at and injured by the Appellant. Learned Trial Judge has

rightly acted upon the evidence of Baby Nona.

08. Learned President's counsel further submitted that Baby Nona has looked back when she

heard the gunshot, which means she had not been facing the door while having dinner. Baby

Nona clearly said that she was facing the door while having dinner. As submitted by the

learned sse, when she said she looked back, she has referred to the back-door. Her evidence

was; (page 74 of the brief),

c: ~t:i)J~(f)ZJi'r; I!f @()tJ @,wr;CJ ttll9@6f ZCJ(J @@ 8C5~~~ ~l[Jt)J. (;@8 t:g~8~c.!

8[]wc;,~?

Therefore, her evidence is clear that she had been facing the back-door while having dinner.

09. Learned President's counsel submitted that the police have delayed recording the statement

and therefore, Baby Nona had time to concoct a story. It is evident that although the incident

took place at about 7.30 p.m., Baby Nona was taken to the hospital only after 4 a.m. the

following day, the reason being, it was during the insurgency period that she could not be

taken in the night. She was suffering from the gunshot injury. Medical Report testifies to that

fact. The daughters of Baby Nona have made statements to the police in the morning itself

clearly implicating the Appellant. Hence, the delay in the police to record the statement till

the same day afternoon will not affect her testimony.

10. Learned counsel submitted that the witness Baby Nona had not told the doctor who examined

her that she was shot by the Appellant. Baby Nona's Medical Report was tendered in

evidence as P2 (Page 288 of the brief). In the Medical Report (M.L.R.), there is a column

where the doctor has to fill the short history given by the patient. The doctor has not recorded

any short history given by the patient but has written as to how the patient was admitted and

transferred in terms of the bed-head-ticket. Therefore, merely because the doctor who

prepared the M.L.R. did not mention the history given by the patient, it will not affect the

credibility of the testimony of the injured Baby Nona.

11. Learned President's counsel for the Appellant further argued that the wife ofthe deceased has

accepted a sum ofRs. 50,0001- as compensation on the basis that her husband (deceased) was

murdered by an unknown gunman. It is common knowledge that the heirs of persons killed

by unknown gunmen during the insurgency period were given compensation by the

government. If the murder was committed by a known person, heirs would not be entitled to

that compensation from the government. This incident has taken place during the insurgency

period. The same day the witnesses including Baby Nona have made statements to the police

clearly identifying the Appellant as the gunman who killed the deceased. Therefore, Baby

6

Nona accepting compensation for the killing of her husband from the government on the

basis that the deceased was killed by an unknown gunman, will not be a reason to reject the

evidence of Baby Nona and the Children that it was the Appellant who shot the deceased. As

rightly submitted by the learned SSC for the Respondent, the evidence of PWI (elder

daughter of the deceased) that she saw the Appellant firing towards inside the house was

never challenged in cross examination by the defence.

Hence, the ground of appeal No.1 which includes 7 sub grounds has no merit.

Ground of Appeal No.2

12. Learned President's counsel for the Appellant contended that it is doubtful whether the

statement of the witness Anusha Nimali was recorded at 8.30 a.m. as testified by the police,

for the reason that she was not produced before the learned Magistrate at 10.15 a.m. for the

inquest citing security reasons and had sought permission to tender her testimony later.

13. As I mentioned before in this Judgment, this incident has taken place during the insurgency

period. Anusha Nimali (PWl) had given evidence at the trial. This issue was never taken up

by the defence at the trial and never even suggested to the witness. So much so, her evidence

on the incident was never challenged in cross examination although she was cross examined.

Investigating officer Wipularatnarn Indram (PWIO) giving evidence said that the 1 st

information was given by the said witness, daughter of the deceased (Anusha) at 8 a.m. on

03.08.1989. He was cross exarnined on the issue of not producing the PW 1 at 10.15 a.m.

before the Magistrate. He said that due to the situation prevailed at that time and as the father

of PW1 was killed and mother too was shot, PWI was in a state of shock. Although, this

officer was cross examined on that issue, his evidence that the first information was given by

the PW 1 at 8 a.m. was never challenged by the defence. Hence, this contention of the learned

President's counsel is untenable.

14. Learned President's counsel further argued that the statement of PWI was marked as 'P3'

without putting the contents to PW 1. It is pertinent to note as [ mentioned before, the

evidence of PW 1 was never challenged by the defence although she was cross examined.

Obviously the first information was disclosed to the defence with the indictment. Not a single

7

contradiction was marked in her evidence with the statement made to the police (P3).

Therefore, not producing the P3 through PWI has caused no prejudice to the defence.

Hence, ground of appeal No.2 is devoid of merit.

Ground of Appeal No.3

15. It is the contention of the learned President's counsel that the learned Trial Judge failed to

consider the adequacy of light to facilitate the identification of the assailant. Police have also

failed to take charge of the lamp, counsel submitted.

16. Prosecution must prove that there was sufficient light for the witnesses to identify the

Appellant. In case of Turnbull [1977/ QB 224, laid down important guidelines for Judges in

trials that involve disputed identification evidence. The question that arose in this case was

whether there was sufficient light for the witnesses to identify the Appellant without mistake.

PW2 (Baby Nona) said in evidence that there was a hurricane lamp lit in the room where she

was with the husband. There had been lamps lit in other rooms as well. She said that even the

kitchen could be seen if one comes to the door in the room. That door had been opened. The

children had been in the kitchen. The person who shot the deceased and the PW2 had come

up to the door step of the room (2 to 3 feet) to shoot. Door was opened. PW2 has therefore

clearly identified the Appellant from the light emanated from the lamp lit in the room. In

villages where they do not have electricity, eyes of the villagers are adjusted to the light

emanates from the lamps. It is evident that the witnesses were known to the Appellant.

17. Evidence of PW2 (Baby Nona) that the lamps were lit in the rooms was not even challenged

by the defence in cross examination. Therefore, mere failure of the police to take the lamps as

productions would not create any doubt on the evidence of the witnesses that the lamps were

lit. As I repeatedly mentioned, the evidence of PW I on the identity of the Appellant and the

shooting by the Appellant was not challenged by the defence. This ground of appeal should

necessarily fail.

8

Ground of Appeal No.4

18. Learned President's counsel brought to the notice of the court that the prosecution failed to

submit the sketch of the house drawn by the Police Officer in evidence. Prosecution

witnesses PWI, PW2, and PW3 gave clear evidence about the house. Those evidence were

not challenged. If there were any questions on the plan of the house favourable to the

defence, counsel could have posed them to the witnesses, which they did not. The Police

Officer not producing the sketch drawn by him has not caused any prejudice to the defence.

This ground has no merit.

Ground of Appeal No.5

19. Learned Trial Judge has said that either Baby Nona or Anusha Nimali should have had the

ability to identify the Appellant. As I said before, the evidence of Anusha Nimali (PW1) on

the identity of the Appellant was never challenged by the defence. Hence, this ground also

has no merit.

Ground of Appeal No.6

20. Baby Nona in her evidence said that the Appellant was not in good terms with her husband

due to some issues in the Village Development Society. However, she did not know much

detail about it. PWI (Anusha Nimali) also said the same thing in evidence. It is the contention

of the counsel for the Appellant that the learned Trial Judge has not taken that into

consideration. However, evidence of PW 1 was not challenged by the defence at the trial.

21. Merely because a witness is a close relative of the deceased, he or she cannot be regarded as

an interested witness. There is no evidence to suggest that PW I and PW2 had any animosity

with the Appellant, other than the fact they knew that the deceased had an issue with the

Appellant at the Village Society.

22. A close relative of the deceased does not, per se, become an interested witness. (Ram

Bharosey V. State of UP AIR /1954/ SC 704)

9

23. In the above premise the learned Trial Judge has no reason to reject the evidence ofPWI and

PW2. This ground is devoid of merit.

Ground of Appeal No.7

24. It is the submission of the Appellant's counsel that the learned Trial Judge has not considered

the two counts separately. The learned Trial Judge has considered the evidence of PWI and

PW2 on the incident upon which the offences in both counts were committed by the

Appellant. It was at the same time, one after the other, the Appellant had shot at the deceased

and the PW2. Deceased in count No.1 succumbed to his injuries and PW2 was also injured by

the gunshot fired by the Appellant. Intentions of the Appellant were clear. Hence, this ground

of appeal should fail.

Ground of Appeal No.8

25. This ground has no basis. At page 282 of the brief, in her judgment, the learned Trial Judge

has narrated the evidence as to how the Appellant was arrested. She has not taken any

previous bad conduct of the Appellant into account. However, at page 277 of the brief, in her

judgment, the learned Trial Judge has narrated the evidence of the Police Officer that the

Accused had left the village after the incident and that he was arrested after four and a half

years. The post conduct of the Accused is admissible.

Ground of Appeal No.9

26. In her Judgment (at page 276 of the appeal brief), the learned Trial Judge has referred to the

evidence on the fact that PW2 has received compensation from the government, on the basis

that the deceased was killed by an unknown gunman. On analyzing that point, the learned

Judge has said that defence has not proved that the compensation was taken on the basis that

the deceased was killed by an unknown gunman. The learned Trial Judge did not shift the

burden to the Accused. There is no such shifting of burden in her Judgment at page 272 of the

brief as submitted by the counsel for the Appellant. This ground has no merit.

10

Ground of Appeal No.10

27. This ground should necessarily fail as the learned Trial Judge has, while narrating the

evidence, has discussed and analyzed the evidence and has come to the correct conclusion.

28. Although no specific ground of appeal was preferred. The learned counsel for the Appellant,

at the argument stage submitted that the amended charge was not read to the Accused on

02.03.2000 (page 66 of the brief). Learned President's counsel further submitted that the

learned Trial Judge failed to discuss circumstantial evidence in her Judgment.

29. On that day, the words 'Ol&c'C ~2S'),~25l' q2>i q~"'~ ~0w' was added to the charge.

Counsel for the Accused has also agreed to the said amendment. However, after the

amendment upon agreement, it was not read to the Accused. As the Accused clearly agreed to

the above amendment (Ol&c'C ~2S'),~25l' q2>i q~"'~ ~0w), it has not caused any prejudice to

the Accused Appellant. Trial proceeded on the basis that the Appellant pleaded not guilty

upon the Accused agreeing to the amendment. Proviso to the Article 138 of the constitution

reads;

"Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned afailure of justice. "

30. Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act provides;

"Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment passed by a

court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or revision

on accoun/-

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant,

charge, judgment, summing up, or other proceedings before or during trial or

in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a failure of jus lice. "

11

31. As the amendment was made in agreement of both parties, failure to read the amended charge

back to the Appellant has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant, nor it has occasioned a

failure of justice.

32. Baby Nona in her evidence did not state that she saw other persons as well with the

Appellant. What she said was from the noises she felt that there were other people as well.

However, her evidence was clear that it was the Appellant who came up to the door step and

shot. As she heard the first gunshot, when she looked at the door, there was the Appellant

holding the gun. Then the Appellant also had shot at her. That was why she said that the

Appellant shot the husband. The only and inescapable inference that could be drawn from the

proved circumstances is that it was the Appellant who shot the deceased. There was no other

conclusion that the Trial Judge could have come to.

Hence, this court has no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge.

Appeal is dismissed.
