01. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted with another 7 Accused persons in the

High Court of Badulla on the following counts.

I. Being members of an unlawful assembly, punishable in terms of section 140 of

the Penal Code.

2

2. Committed the offence of murder of O. Vijitha Kumara, punishable in terms of

section 296 to be read with section 146 of the Penal Code.

3. Committed the offence of attempted murder of K.O. Thilakaratne, punishable in

terms of section 300 to be read with section 146 of the Penal Code.

4. Caused injury to one W.M. Abeyratane, punishable in terms of section 315 to be

read with section 146 of the Penal Code.

5. Committed murder of O. Vijitha Kumara, punishable in terms of section 296 of

the Penal Code.

6. Committed attempted murder of K.O. Thilakaratne, punishable in terms of section

300 of the Penal Code.

7. Caused injury to W.M. Abeyratne, punishable under section 315 of the Penal

Code.

02. After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant (1st Accused) for 5th and

7'h counts and sentenced accordingly. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence

the Appellant preferred the instant appeal. The grounds of appeal urged by the learned

counsel for the Appellant are;

I. The learned High Court Judge had believed the evidence of the prosecution

without a proper evaluation of the evidence.

2. The learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the

contradictory evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

3. The learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence of the defence.

3

4. The learned High Court Judge had failed to give reasons to reject the defence

evidence.

5. The learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the evidence of

the defence regarding grave and sudden provocation and sudden fight.

03. I carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, judgment of the learned High Court

Judge, written submissions of counsel for the Appellant and the Respondent and the

submissions made by counsel for both parties at the argument.

Facts in brief

04. Prosecution called three eye witnesses to give evidence. They are W.M. Gunasekera

(PWl), W.M. Abeyratne (PW3) and G.K.G. Thilakaratne (PW6). PW3 is the injured in

counts No.4 and 7 and PW6 is the injured in counts No.3 and 6.

05. According to the evidence ofPWl , six of them including the deceased had come to the bus

halt for 3 of them to get a bus. Then the Appellant and other Accused persons had come and

assaulted them. In that the Appellant had stabbed the deceased. PW3 in his evidence

testified that the Appellant after stabbing the deceased also stabbed him twice. Although the

deceased was taken to the hospital in a bus he had succumbed to his injuries.

Grounds of Appeal No.1 and 2

06. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the Appellant that the learned Trial Judge has

not evaluated the evidence adequately in believing the version of the prosecution witnesses.

Further, it is submitted that the contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses

were not considered by the learned Trial Judge.

07. On perusing the judgment, it is clear that the learned Trial Judge has sufficiently analyzed

the evidence of the prosecution as well as the defence in arriving at his conclusion. He has

considered all aspects including the possible defences available to the defence to consider

4

lesser culpability on the evidence adduced at the trial. There was only one contradiction

marked as V I in the evidence of PW I. That was on the person who lit the cigarette. The

evidence was that one of them went to the boutique and bought the cigarettes. The

discrepancy on the evidence as to who lit the cigarette first will not affect the credibility of

the witness.

08. Miner contradictions per se or inter se, those do not go to the root of the issue would not

affect the credibility of a witness or the case for the prosecution as a whole. A witness

cannot be expected to remember every minute detail of what happened. Further, it is not

possible for a witness to give evidence on all minor details of an incident at the trial that is

conducted after a lapse of many years as if replaying a recorded video. Evidence of

witnesses has to be considered as a whole when deciding on the credibility of a witness.

09. In case of State of Uttar Pradesh V. M. K. AnthollY [1984[ SCJ 236/ [1985J CR!. LJ. 493

at 498/499 it was held;

"While appreciatillg the evidence of a witness, the approach must

be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have ring of

truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court

to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the defiCiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate

them to find oUl whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given

by the wi/ness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as

to render it unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies on trivial mailers not

touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences

torn out of context here and there from evidence, allaching importance to

some technical error commilled by the investigating officer not going to the

root of the mailer would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a

whole. If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the

opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by

the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to allach

due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless there

are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the

5

evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the mailer of

trivial details. "

10. As I stated before, the inconsistencies found in the evidence of the witnesses for the

prosecution are of trivial in nature and would not go into the root of the issue.

II. The learned High Court Judge has sufficiently analyzed the evidence of all witnesses and

carefully considered the same. Hence, grounds of appeal No. I and 2 should necessarily

fail.

Grounds of Appeal No.3 and 4

12. Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned Trial Judge has not considered the

evidence of the defence. Upon the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the Appellant

has made a statement from the dock. No other witnesses were called to testify on his behalf.

All other Accused persons made statements from the dock.

13. The position taken up by the Appellant was that when he was on the way to the police

station, he was assaulted by the other party (prosecution witnesses) and he complained to

the police. The deceased and two other witnesses for the prosecution have received stab

injuries, and the prosecution witnesses have given clear evidence as to how they got

injured. The evidence makes it clear that it was the Appellant who stabbed the deceased and

that the dock statement denying the same cannot be accepted. The learned Trial Judge was

right in accepting the evidence of the prosecution against the Appellant and rejecting the

version of the defence.

14. In case of Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha V. The Attorney General CA.

30312006 and CA. L.A. 321106, it was held;

" ... Finally having considered the case for the prosecution as well as

the dock statement it is only then the learned Judge can decide whether or not

the dock statement is sufficient to create a doubt in the case for the

6

prosecution. One cannot isolate or disregard the prosecution case completely

and consider only the dock statement in deciding whether the dock statement

is sufficient to create a doubt provided it is so obvious, that the dock statement

is only a bear denial or is irrational or palpably false, in which case it could

be rejected without even considering the evidence for the prosecution. "

Further, the court held;

"Failure to evaluate a dock statement in the proper perspective shall

not ipso facto vitiate a conviction if the dock statement is

a) A bare denial

b) Palpably false and unbelievable. "

15. On the evidence placed before the learned Trial Judge, there is no other conclusion that the

Trial Judge could have come to other than that the Appellant inflicted the injuries to the

deceased causing his death.

Hence the grounds of appeal No.3 and 4 are without merit.

Ground of Appeal No.5

16. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that if the learned Trial Judge considered the

defence (dock statement of the 5th Accused) version, he could have convicted the Appellant

for a lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, on the basis of a sudden

fight. The learned Trial Judge has sufficiently discussed and considered this aspect in his

judgment. In pages 19 to 24 (pages 304 to 319 of the brief) of the judgment, the learned

Trial Judge has extensively considered this aspect, and rightly concluded that the

culpability cannot be brought down to an offence under section 297 of the Penal Code.

Therefore, this ground of appeal also should fail.

7

17. In the above premise, this court has no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

High Court Judge and I affirm the conviction and the sentences imposed on the Appellant

by the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal is dismissed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J

I agree.
