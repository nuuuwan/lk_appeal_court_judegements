A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Officer in Charge of the Ratnapura Police filed an information in terms

of Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Court's Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (as

amended) in the Magistrates Court of Ratnapura, relating to a disputed roadway

between the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the Appellant) and the 1st Party Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent. (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent). Having considered the information, the affidavits

and the supporting documents tendered, the learned Magistrate on 06/12/2010,

made order preventing the Respondent from using the roadway, on the basis that

Page 2of8

. the Respondent has failed to substantiate his claim to have access to the disputed

road. Aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Respondent

preferred a revision application to the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa

Province holden in Ratnapura. The learned High Court Judge by order dated

05/05/2016, set aside the said order and inter alia, held that the disputed roadway

was the only access road to the Respondent's land. The Appellant is before this

Court to set aside the said order dated 05/05/2016.

When this matter was taken up for argument the Appellant urged the

following grounds in appeal.

I. when an alternate remedy exists, invocation of revisionary jurisdiction

should be denied.

2. the availability of an alternate road to access the Respondent's land.

By Deeds No. 6162, dated 0711112002 and 6996, dated 24/03/20 I 0, the

Respondent became the owner of the land called "Dummala Akure Mukalana".

The said potion of land is depicted as Lot. 463 in the final village Plan No. 92

marked" I E) 11". (Vide page 116 in the brief). The existence of the roadway in

dispute is not shown in the said plan. However, Dingiri Mahattaya, who was the

previous owner of Lot. 463, in his affidavit filed of record marked "W6" (Vide

page. 406 in the brief) states that, the only access road to the land was a 12 feet

road which was in existence for 12 years at the time of transfer of the land to the

Respondent. Even though, by subsequent affidavits, the said deponent denied the

Page 3 of 8

transfer of the right to use the road, he has not denied the existence of such road.

(Vide affidavits marked "2f:J7" and "2f:J7(q)", at page 243 and 273 of the brief).

According to the survey report of Plan No. 3759, it is stated,

H@@@ @~tf(I)c.:J wldl~ !Jo @WlS) t::!f'(wd 3759 8~@tf t;lt:rl@t}Z5) J;j)l.lf. 50 t::!w 60

9@tJro tJ@o @t}Z5)ZJ! !JJ;j)c!o @~tf(I) Z5)llS). "

It is also stated that access roads to the disputed land depicted as Lots 341 ,

342, 225 and 227 are unusable. The position of the Respondent was that, the 12 ft

wide road, the only available road access to his land called "Dumrnala Akure

Mukalana" of Marapana Colony was illegally blocked by the Appellant on

01 /06/2010 and the Respondent relies on Plan No. 3759 marked " WIO" (Vide

page 208 in the brief) to assert his claim.

The said Dingiri Mahattaya in his statement to the Police dated 03/06/20 I 0,

(Vide page 211 in the brief) has admitted that the disputed road is the only road

which could be used by both parties. The affidavits tendered by the Respondent

too, supports the position that the disputed road is used by both parties. (" 1~13 "

" WI6" Vide page 212-215 in the brief). Police Inspection Report marked "PI(a)"

states that the disputed road used by the Respondent was in existence for around

14-15 years and apart from the said road, the Respondent has no other alternate

road to access his tea plantation.

Page 4 of8

The position of the Appellant is that the Respondent's plan annexed with

the Affidavit tendered to the Magistrates Court (Vide page 232 marked "2El2")

shows that there are two alternate roads which the Respondent could use and

further contends that the affidavits relied upon by the Appellant suggests that the

disputed road was only used by the Appellant. (Vide page 245-272 of the brief).

The learned Magistrate having considered the affidavits and the supporting

documents filed of record concluded that the Respondent had failed to establish

his entitlement as of a servitude right or by an order of Court.

It is trite law that when a party is seeking relief under Section 69 of the Act,

the party is not called upon to establish entitlement to the right in the manner

required before a District Court by presenting cogent evidence.

In Ramalingam Vs. Tltangarajalt (1982) 2 SLR 693, Sharvananda, J. (as

he then was) stated that,

"On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to section

69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle"

here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the

parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right. In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine

Page 5 of 8

the question which party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an

order under section 69(2). "

There is no dispute between the parties regarding the existence of the

disputed road. In the circumstances, when a party is to establish that he "is entitled

for the time being to exercise that right" careful consideration should be given in

order to determine as to whether the party claiming entitlement for the time being

has used the disputed road. Existence of a road does not necessarily mean that a

person's right to use it is established. The evidence before Court is that there are

no alternate roads to access the Respondents land, the surveyor report and the

police report confirms this position and the fact that the Respondent used the

disputed road is established by the affidavits tendered on behalf of the

Respondent, which strengthens the position of the Respondent's case.

"The ultimate object of s. 68, and s. 69 being to restore the person entitled to the

right to the possession of land to the possession thereof or to restore the person

entitled to the right (other than the right to possession of land) to the enjoyment

thereof-the said provision of the law must be rationally construed to authorize by

necessary implication if in fact they had not in terms done so, the removal of all

obstructions if the need arise, in the process of restoring the right to the person

held to be entitled to such right. "(Tudor Vs. Anulawathie and Others (1999) 3

SLR 235)

Page 6 of 8

In terms of Section 74 of the Act, an order made under Section 69(2) of the

Act "shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in any land which any

person may be able to establish in a civil suit". Accordingly, the learned High

Court Judge in terms of Section 69(2) of the Act, has made order declaring that the

Respondent shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any

part of the land specified in the order until such person is deprived of such right by

virtue of an order or decree of a competent Court. Therefore, a pending civil suit

to determine the rights or interest in a land would not deprive a person's

entitlement to the right which is the subject of the dispute until such person is

deprived of such right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent Court.

Therefore, the position taken by the Appellant that this case cannot be maintained

due to the pendency of the District Court action is devoid of any merit.

In Welikakala Witllanage Silantila Sri Jayalal and Anotller vs.

Kusumawatllie Pigera and Otllers (CA (PHC) APN 6912009, C.A.M.

23.07.2013), where Salam J. held (at page 5-6);

"it does not mean, that the Petitioner who invokes the revisionary powers of the

court should in his petition state in so many words that "exceptional grounds

exist" to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction in addition to pleading the grounds on

which the revision is sought ...

it is actually for the court to find out whether the circumstances enumerated in the

petition constitute exceptional circumstances. "

Page 7 of 8

In the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge has correctly

determined that there are exceptional circumstances which warrants the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction to set aside the order of the learned Magistrate. We see no

reason to interfere with the said decision and accordingly, both grounds of appeal

urged by the Appellant are rejected.

For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss this appeal without costs.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
