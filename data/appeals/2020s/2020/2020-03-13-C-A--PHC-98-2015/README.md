The Officer in Charge of the Wellawatte Police filed information in terms

of the provisions contained in Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in the Magistrates Court of

Colombo making the Party of the 1st Part Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) and the Party of the 2nd Part Respondent-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant), over a dispute of possession of a

Restaurant situated at No. 52, Galle road, Wellawatte. The learned Magistrate by

order dated 19/02/2013, handed over possession of the disputed premises to the

Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent filed a reVISIOn

application in the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo. By order dated 10/07/2015, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

set aside the order of the learned Magistrate and granted possession of the said

premises to the Respondent. It is the said order that the Appellant is seeking to

canvass by this application.

A dispute arose between the parties with regard to possession of premises

In which a Restaurant business was carried on. The respective parties are at

varIance as to who was in possession of the date of notice. According to the

complaint made to the police by the Respondent on 0811 0/20 12, the Appellant

having obtained a key to the Restaurant through a staff member of the Respondent,

entered the premises together with several other persons and had forcibly taken

over possession of the Restaurant. It is also claimed that on 0611012012, there had

been a discussion between the Appellant and the Respondent to run the Restaurant

as a business partnership, however, there has been no consent or a valid agreement

between the parties. Therefore, the Respondent claims that the Appellant

unlawfully entered the said premises and deprived the Respondent from lawful

possession of the said premises.

The main grounds of appeal are as follows;

a) has the learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to decide the party

which has established possession over the matter in dispute.

b) has the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate that an application for

revision will be allowed only at the instance of showing exeptional

circumstances by the party invoking jurisdiction.

The contention of the Appellant is that, he was in possession of the disputed

premises at the time of dispute. "Section 68 requires the judge to make a

declaration as to who is entitled to possession. He should first make a

determination as to who was in possession on the date of the notice. Magistrate

should evaluate the evidence". (David Appultamy vs. Yassi Thero (1987) 1 SLR

253)

Section 68 (1) of the Act states;

"Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall be

the duty of the judge of the Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to

who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of the

information under Section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to possession of

such land or pqrt thereof"

Page 4 of 7

Section 68(3) of the Act states;

"Where at an mquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession of any

land or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that any

person who had been in possession of the land or part has been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the date on which

the information was filed under Section 66, he may make a determination to that

effect and make an order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to

possession and prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than

under the authority of an order or decree of a competent court. "

Therefore, the Court has to decide the question of actual possession on the

date of filing the information under Section 66(1 )(a) of the Code. In a case where a

person who has been in possession of the land and had been forcibly dispossessed

within the period of two months immediately preceding the date of filing of the

first infOtmation, the Court is required to make order directing the restoration of

possessIOn.

U.D.z. Gunawardana, J. in Iqbal vs. Majedudeen and Others took the view

that the words "forcibly dispossessed" in Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts Act

No. 44 of 1979 as amended means that dispossession had taken place against the

will of the person entitled to possess and without authority of the Law.

In the course of the judgment the learned Judge acknowledged possession

to be of two kinds.

I. When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time-actual

possession.

2. When he is not in actual possession he may have both a power and intention at

a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or

through another person-constructive possession.

The learned Magistrate has considered the affidavit and the documents,

filed by the Appellant (copies of the documents tendered are not duly certified)

relevant to establish possession over the disputed premises. The Appellant has

tendered a purported agreement between the parties marked "0 1". The said

agreement does not refer to either party, before Court and also is unsigned. (Vide

page 174 of the brief). The Appellant also relied on a certificate of Registartion of

an individual business, marked "0 2". (Vide page 179 of the brief). The said

certificate makes reference to the Appellant as the owner of the disputed

restaurant. However, it is observed that, the Appellant had registered the said

business on 10/10/2012, two days after the first information was filed. The

payment receipts regarding utility bills, marked "0 3", "0 5" and "0 8" relates to

payments made on the date the information was filed or thereafter. (Vide page 57,

61 and 64 of the brief). Copies of the inventry and salary payments referred to in

Documents marked "0 9;', "0 10" and "0 11 " can not be considered as evidence

in favour of the Appellant, due to its inconsistencies. There is no evidence to

establish that the Appellant was dispossessed of actual possession or constructive

Page 6 of7

,

possession of the disputed premises two months prior to the filing of information

and therefore, the argument of dispossession of the Appellant fails.

I will now consider whether this Court has sufficient reason to consider this

application on exeptional circumstances. It is well settled law that, the party

seeking to invoke the revisionery jurisdiction of this Court has to demonstrate the

existance of exceptional circumstances. Revision would lie if, inter-alia, acts

should have prejudiced his substantial rights or acts should have occasioned a

failure of justice. (Siripa/a vs. Lanerolle and Another (2012) 1 SLR 105)

As noted above the affidavits and documents tendered by the Appellant has

no relevance whatsoever to establish that the Appellant was dispossessed from the

disputed restaurant. Therefore, in order to rectify a failure of justice the

exceptional circumstances as noted earlier, clearly warrants the intervention of the

High Court by way of revision.

For the aforesaid reasons, the Judgment of the High Court is affirmed and

this application is dismissed.

Application dismissed. I make no order as to costs.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
