Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Manohara De Silva, P.C., with Imalka Abeysinghe for the Petitioners Vikum De Abrew, Senior Deputy Solicitor General with Ms. Chaya Sri Nammuni, Senior State Counsel for the Respondents Argued on: 17th June 2020 Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioners on 28th October 2019 Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 4th July 2018 Decided on: 29th July 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioners have filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in paragraph 3(a) of

Public Administration Circular No. 6/2006 (VII) dated 22nd August 2008

marked P8 by which it was decided that Officers who had been promoted

to Class I of the Sri Lanka Engineering Service and the Sri Lanka Accountants

Service shall be entitled to three increments based on the value of such

increment at the time they were promoted to Class II Grade I;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to grant three increments

to the Petitioners based on the present value of such increment;

4

c) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from discriminating

between Class I Officers who were promoted to Class I prior to, and after 1st

January 2006.

The complaint of the Petitioners is that the said decision contained in paragraph

3(a) of P8 is arbitrary, illegal and irrational. In considering this complaint of the

Petitioner, this Court must be mindful that in this application, this Court is

exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed to its Appellate jurisdiction. This

distinction has been referred to in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth1 in

the following manner:

"The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of

appeals. When hearing an appeal the court is concerned with the merits of a

decision: is it correct? When subjecting some administrative act or order to

judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality: is it within the limits of

the powers granted? On an appeal the question is right or wrong?' On

review the question is lawful or unlawful?

As Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales

Police v Evans2, applications for judicial review are often misconceived:

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed,

the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power,

be itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as the words imply, is not

an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision

was made..

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

At the time of filing this application, all Petitioners were Public Officers, with the

1st 5th Petitioners being Class I Officers of the Sri Lanka Engineering Service and

the 6th 10th Petitioners being Class I Officers of the Sri Lanka Accountants

Service. All Petitioners had been promoted to Class I of their Service between

1987 and 1993.

According to the relevant Service Minute,3 recruitment to each Service was

effected to Class II Grade II. While an Officer who had completed inter alia ten

years of satisfactory service was eligible to be promoted to Class II Grade I, all

Officers who had completed eighteen years of overall service were eligible to be

promoted to Class I, on seniority and merit.

By Circular No. 6/2006 dated 25th April 2006 marked P4 issued by the Ministry of

Public Administration and Home Affairs, the Government had re-structured the

Public Service salaries, service grades and promotional procedures, with effect

from 1st January 2006.

The grades and salary scales that existed prior to the introduction of P4, and

which were applicable to the aforementioned three Classes, were as follows:

3 Vide documents marked P2a and P2b.

6

Class Salary Scale Class II Grade IITB 5 1 2 Class II Grade I TB 6 1 Class ITB 7 1

The changes that were introduced by P4 included the following:

a) All Officers belonging to the aforementioned Services handling executive

functions, including the Petitioners, were categorised as Executives;

b) The aforementioned Class/Grades were amended as follows:

Prior to P4After P4Class II Grade IIGrade IIIClass II Grade I Grade II Class IGrade I c) All three service grades were placed on a unified salary scale of SL-1.

It is noted that prior to the introduction of P4, the salary scales of the said

Classes had been revised with effect from 1st January 2004, with those in the said

Services receiving the following salaries:

Class Salary Scale Starting salary

Number of increments and valueClass II Grade IITB 5 1 2 13125 16 / Rs. 315 Class II Grade ITB 6 1 1791507 / Rs. 645Class I TB 7 1 22970 10 / Rs. 990

The salary scales that were introduced with effect from 1st January 2006 in terms

of P4 were as follows:

7

Class Salary Scale Starting salary

Number of increments and valueGrade III SL-1 22935 10 / Rs. 645 Grade II SL-1 30715 07 / Rs. 790 Grade I SL-1 36755 16 / Rs. 1050

The Petitioners state that when converting the salary scales from the previous

salary scales, to SL-1, there was an anomaly created between the salaries of those

who were promoted to Class II Grade I, before 31st December 2005, and after 1st

January 2006, with the latter category receiving four salary steps more than the

former category in view of the fast tracked promotion scheme that existed prior

to the introduction of P4. It was therefore recommended that this anomaly be

rectified by the granting of four salary increments to the former category.4 What

is important is that the four increments were not being granted out of the

increments that an Officer was entitled, to by virtue of being an Officer in Class I,

but were increments out of Class II Grade I.

What is equally important is that this anomaly did not affect the Petitioners

directly, as they had been promoted to Class I as far back as 1993, and were

placed, with the introduction of P4, on a salary commensurate with the number

of increments that they had already received by that time. For example, the 1st

Petitioner had been promoted to Class I in August 1989, and had earned

maximum salary increments in Class I by the time P4 was introduced. With P4

coming into force, the 1st Petitioner was entitled to receive increments for the

sixteen years he had served by then in Class I, and should have accordingly been

placed on the maximum salary scale of SL-1, and entitled to receive a monthly

salary in a sum of Rs. 53,555. The Petitioners have not tendered any material to

4 Vide letter dated 30th October 2006 marked P6 sent by the National Salaries and Cadres Commission.

8

demonstrate that they were placed on a lower salary scale. Thus, the

recommendation to grant four increments was limited to those who had been

promoted to Class II Grade I prior to 31st December 2005, and who were in

service as at 1st January 2006 in the newly created Grade II.

The Petitioners have however claimed that the aforementioned recommendation

to grant four salary increments would result in a chain reaction when making

promotions to Class I for the reason that those Officers who were already in Class I

had not received the same increments and therefore those officers who come in

the future to Class I from Class II would enjoy a higher salary. It is noted that

under P4, an Officer, once he is promoted to Class I, was entitled to receive

sixteen salary increments. Thus, even with four salary increments of Class II Grade

I being added to an Officer who had been promoted to Class II Grade I prior to 31st

December 2005, and assuming that with the said four salary increments, such

Officer became eligible to be promoted to Class I under P4, such Officer would

be sixteen salary steps/increments behind the Petitioners, who, with the

introduction of P4 and by virtue of having almost twenty years in Class I, were

placed at the maximum salary scale of SL-1. Thus, while there may have been a

chain reaction, the concern of the Petitioners that there would be a chain

reaction that would affect them, appears to be unfounded. The Petitioners have

not placed before this Court any material that would suggest otherwise.

The above recommendation to grant four increments of Class II Grade I to those

who had been promoted to Class II Grade I prior to 31st December 2005, had been

implemented by the Ministry of Public Administration through an amendment to

P4. The amendment Circular i.e. PA Circular No. 06/2006(VII) dated 22nd

August 2008 marked P8 reads as follows:

9

After the introduction of the SL-1-2006 salary scale by the above circular

with effect from 1st January 2006 to the All Island Services and to the posts

for which equivalent salaries have been assigned, the officers promoted prior

to the above date have received relatively a lower salary than the salary

entitled to certain officers promoted from the new Grade III to the Grade II (

formerly from Grade II/II to Grade II/I).

02) In order to rectify the anomaly, it has been decided, to grant 3 salary

increments (Rs.790x3) of Grade II to the officers, who had been promoted to

grade II/I or II before 01.01.2006 and remaining in the same grade on the

said date of an All Island Service or in any other post drawing equivalent

salaries remaining in the same grade after converting their salaries to SL-1-

2006 if they have fulfilled the requirements given below:

(a) Should have been in receipt of a salary on the salary scale of TB-6-1 by

31-12-2005.

(b) Should have served in a grade assigned with a salary scale of TB-5-1-2

or a corresponding salary scale which had been in force earlier, before

being promoted to the grade assigned with the salary scale of TB-6-1.

(c) Should have served for a period of not less than 10 years in the salary

scale of TB-5-1-2 or in a salary scale corresponding to it and should

have earned all the salary increments relating to the particular salary

scale when the above promotion was made.

The above paragraph makes it clear that the three increments are being granted

to those who remain in Grade II after 1st January 2006, which means that the

10

increments that were being granted were increments that are due for Class II

Grade I, and not Class I. Therefore, paragraph 2 of P8 was not applicable to the

Petitioners.

The paragraphs in P8 which are in issue in this application are paragraphs 3 and

5, and are re-produced below:

03) Action should be taken as given below in respect of officers who have

fulfilled the requirements mentioned in paragraph 02 above and promoted

prior to 01.01.2006 to Class I of an All Island Service or any post assigned

with the equivalent salary, that is TB-7-1 and remained in same grade on that

prescribed date.

(a) To convert the salary of officers to the salary scale relevant to Class I

on hypothetical basis by adding 3 salary increments (based on the

value of grade II or II/I) based on the incremental value as applicable

to the date of promotion, to the salary drawn last by officers whilst in

grade II or II/I.5

(b) Thereafter, grant salary increments on hypothetical basis, if the salary

increments have subsequently been earned up to 31.12.2005.

5 The Sinhala text of paragraph 3(a) reads as follows: by; 02 jeks fPaofha i|yka wjYH;d imqrd" 2006.01.01 oskg fmr osm jHdma; fiajdjl fyda Bg iudk jegqma kshu lr we;s ;k;=rl I mka;shg" tkus gSnS-7-1 jegqma mrsudKh ysus mka;shlg$fYaKshlg Wiiajsus ,nd" toskgo tu fiajfha isgs ks,Odrska iusnkaOfhka my; i|yka mrsos lghq;= l, hq;=h'

(c) Subsequently, place on the salary step relating to Grade I of the SL-1-

2006 salary scale corresponding to the salary step, of the salary scale

TB-7-1 with effect from 01.01.2006 on hypothetical basis.

(04) .... (Not applicable to the Petitioners).

(05) Accordingly, in placing the officers to whom the paragraph 03 and 04

above is applicable, on the relevant salary scale on 01.01.2006, the relevant

Authorities should ensure that the officers are placed on the specific salary

step entitled only to the number of salary increments earned by them as at

31.12.2005. The arrears will not be paid for the increments earned on

hypothetical basis, up to 31.12.2005. Please refer paragraph 03 of the Public

Administration Circular No: 06/2006 dated 25.04.2006 and paragraphs 03

and 04 of Public Administration Circular N0: 06/2006 (VI) dated 26.06.2008

for further clarifications.

(06) There is a possibility that there would be no increase in the present

salaries drawn by certain officers in making conversions in terms of this

Circular. It will not be considered as an anomaly.

The effect of paragraphs 3 and 5 of P8 was to grant three increments even to

those who had been promoted to Class I prior to 1st January 2006, and therefore

included the Petitioners. This was to prevent an Officer in Class II Grade I as at 31st

December 2005, receiving a salary higher than an Officer who is already in Class I

as at 31st December 2005 and continues in Grade I after 1st January 2006, by

virtue of receiving three increments in terms of paragraph 2 of P8. Three

increments of Class II Grade I being granted to all officers who were in Class I as at

12

31st December 2005 thus restored the parity in terms of the number of

increments received by each Officer in Class I as at 31st December 2005.

The complaint of the Petitioners arises from the decision in paragraph 3 of P8 to

grant the Petitioners increments based on the incremental value as applicable to

the date of promotion to Class II Grade I, which they claim is very low. The

Petitioners have therefore alleged that their starting salary in Class I is lower than

the starting salary step of Officers promoted to Class I after the introduction of

P8.6 However, the Petitioners have not placed before this Court any material to

establish this statement, nor have the Petitioners produced any material to

demonstrate that they have been discriminated by the contents of P8.

The Respondents have explained the effect of the anomaly as follows:

Answering the averments in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the said Petition, the

Respondents state that the anomaly in the salary structure was in relation

to the officers who were promoted to Class II (Grade I) prior to 1.1.2006.

There was no such salary anomaly in respect of Class I officers and the

present incremental value was given to officers who had been promoted

prior to 1.1.2006 to Class II Grade I since their salary was short of the

amount of three increments at the present incremental value in order to

tally with the salaries of those who were promoted after 01.01.2006. The

Respondents further state that the determining factor is not the

incremental value but the number of increments in view of the fact that if

6 Vide paragraph 24(b) of the petition.

13

an increment is given there is a strong likelihood of the increment getting

increased with the oncoming salary revisions. 7

It may be true that the value of the increment granted to, for e.g. a hypothetical

Officer in Class II Grade I who is promoted to that Grade in 2004 can be higher

than, for e.g. the value of the increment that the 1st Petitioner would have

received in Class II Grade I, as at the date he was promoted to Class I (i.e. in

August 1989). However, what is important is that the cut off date for receiving

increments, or the equaliser date, for both categories of persons - i.e. the 1st

Petitioner, and the hypothetical Officer - would be 1st January 2006. Thus,

whatever the quantum or value of the increment of Class II Grade I received prior

to 31st December 2005, with the introduction of P4 with effect from 1st January

2006, the difference in salary that existed between the 1st Petitioner and the

hypothetical Officer prior to P8, which may have been affected by the

increments in paragraph 2 of P8, would be restored to the position that existed

prior to the granting of three increments to those referred to in paragraph 2 of

P8.

This position can be illustrated as follows. The 1st Petitioner, for e.g., having been

promoted to Class I in August 1989 had acquired the maximum number of

increments payable in Class I in terms of the revised salary structure introduced

with effect from 1st December 2004 vide P3c. It is assumed that with the

introduction of P4, the 1st Petitioner, by virtue of having been in Class I for 16

years, would have been entitled to be placed at increment number 16, which is

the maximum that an Officer in Class I could be placed at. Thus, as far as the 1st

Petitioner is concerned, whether the 1st Petitioner receives any further

7 Vide paragraph 10 of the Statement of Objections.

14

increments in terms of P8 is immaterial. This would in fact apply to all

Petitioners, as they had served a minimum of 13 years in Class I, prior to P4.

However, if one takes the case of an Officer who had been promoted to Class I as

at 1st January 2005, and an Officer in Class II Grade I who by virtue of getting three

increments as per the adjustment made in terms of paragraph 2 of P8, qualifies

to be promoted to Class I on 1st January 2006, the former officer may be at a

disadvantage. It appears that paragraph 3 of P8 has been introduced to rectify

this extremely rare situation, so that the Officer who had been promoted to Class

I on 1st January 2005 would now be entitled to get his appointment to Class I

pushed by three years by virtue of getting three increments for Class II Grade I. In

the said circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioners have failed to place

any material before this Court to demonstrate that paragraph 3 of P8 is

arbitrary or irrational.

There is one other matter that I must advert to. The Petitioners claim that the

issue raised in this application had been raised by them with the Respondents

prior to the filing of this application. The Petitioners have submitted letters dated

1st September 2008 and 26th March 2009 sent by the 1st Petitioner marked P10a

and P10b respectively, as proof thereof. I have examined P10a and observe

that, while the issue before this Court has not been discussed at all, the

Petitioners had only raised an issue relating to their non-promotion to a grade

that would have qualified them to receive the salary due under category SL-3.

Similarly, I have examined P10b and observe that the complaint of the

Petitioners was that by virtue of the three increments granted by P8, other

Officers in Class I could reach the maximum salary scale in SL-1 within thirteen

years of service, while the Petitioners had to serve seventeen years to reach the

15

maximum salary scale in SL-1. This grievance of the Petitioners has nothing to do

with the complaint presented in this application.

In the above circumstances, I do not see any legal basis to grant the relief prayed

for by the Petitioners. This application is accordingly dismissed without costs.
