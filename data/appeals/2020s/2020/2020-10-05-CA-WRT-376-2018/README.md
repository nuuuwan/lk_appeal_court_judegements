Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is a slightly complicated matter, perhaps because of the

voluminous documents filed by the parties at different stages of

the case, not in keeping with the Court of Appeal Rules. Some

of the documents appear to be contradictory not per se but inter

se. Several Plans have been tendered for approval to the Urban

Development Authority (UDA); the approvals have been granted

and thereafter revoked etc. Discussion of each and every

document will confuse the reader. Let me endeavour to separate

the wheat from the chaff and address the issue straightaway.

The dispute relates to the use of the road marked Lot 4 in Plan

No.694 marked P1.

By filing this application, the Petitioners, who claim to be the

owners of Lots 5, 6 and 8 of Plan No.694, mainly seek to quash

the Permits marked P28 and P31, and Plan No.1363 marked

P27 presented for the approval of the said two Permits.

P28 is a residential development Permit issued by the UDA to

the 4th Respondent to develop Lot 1 in Plan No.1363, subject to

certain conditions.

In regard to P28, the contention of the Petitioners is twofold.

One contention is Plan No.1363 does not represent the correct

position of the ground situation, in that, although a portion of

the projected part of the land lying to the west of the turning

circle has been sold to the 7th Respondent by the 4th

Respondent, it is not reflected in the Plan. In other words, Lot

10 of Plan No.694 was subdivided into two lots (311 and 312) as

seen from Plan No.1173A marked P26(a), and it is the position of

5

the Petitioners that it was Lot 311 which was sold to the 7th

Respondent by Deed P10. This is not disputed by the 7th

Respondent.

The other contention is Lot 4 in Plan No.694 serves as a roadway

to Lots 3, 5-9 and Lots 311 and 312 in Plan No.1173A

(altogether eight lots). The Petitioners say this is in

contravention of the UDA Regulations as gazetted in P8(a),

which say the width of a road with less than eight residential

units shall be 15 feet. Lot 4, according to Plan No.694, is 15 feet

wide.

Even with the subdivision of Lot 10 into two, the roadway

marked Lot 4 in Plan No.694 serves only eight residential units.

There is no violation of P8(a).

Therefore, I see no reason to quash by certiorari P28, which has

been issued for the residential development of Lot 1 in Plan

No.1363 as one unit.

By the same token, I am not inclined to quash Plan No.1363

marked P27 by certiorari. Seeking to quash a Plan by certiorari

is, in my view, misconceived in law.

The next document the Petitioners seek to quash by certiorari is

P31.

P31 is not a residential development Permit. It is a Permit

issued to grant permission to the 4th Respondent to sub-divide

Lot 1 in Plan No.1363.

The 4th Respondent is a land developer. He had purchased the

larger land, namely Ahalagahawatta, abutting Lot 10 in Plan

No.694 to the south, and amalgamated Ahalagahawatta with Lot

6

10 as one unit to subdivide and sell. This is crystal clear from

P31, although learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

UDA attempted to say at the argument that P31 is a residential

development Permit similar to P28. P28 and P31 have been

issued for different purposes.

The 1st, 2nd and 9th Respondents, the Deputy Director Planning,

the Provincial Director and the Chairman of the UDA,

respectively, state in paragraph 17 of their joint statement of

objections:

(i) Lot number 1 of Plan marked P27 has been approved

for residential use at the Planning committee held on

01.11.2017;

(ii) By the document marked P31, the 4th Respondent

has been Permitted to develop lot number 1 of P27 as

one lot for residential purpose;

(iii) The 4th Respondent is not Permitted to sub-divide the

said lot as per P31.

However, in paragraph 19 of the corresponding affidavit, the

Director General of the UDA says the subdivision of the said lot

was Permitted by P31:

(i) Lot number 1 of Plan marked P27 has been approved

for residential use at the Planning committee held on

01.11.2017;

(ii) The approval has been given to the Petitioner by P31

to develop lot number 1 of P27 as one lot for

residential purposes and the subdivision of the said

lot as per the aforesaid document is Permitted.

7

The objections and the affidavit are contradictory. Either way,

the UDA fails.

If subdivision of Lot 1 in Plan No.1363 is allowed for commercial

purposes, the road to be used for the subdivided lots is Lot 4 in

Plan No.694. The Petitioners position is the said road violates

regulation 20(1) marked P8(b) read with the 1st schedule to the

Gazette marked P8(a). That is, in that event, more than eight

residential units will be using Lot 4 in Plan No.694 as a road,

which is not permissible according to the UDA Regulations as

gazetted in P8.

According to the UDAs own explanation, the P31 subdivision

Permit cannot be allowed to stand. Hence I quash P31 by

certiorari.

This does not prevent the UDA from reconsidering afresh the

application of the 4th Respondent for subdivision of Lot 1 in Plan

No.1363 for commercial purposes, and making a suitable order

in accordance with the law. If a fresh decision is to be taken,

both parties (the 4th Respondent and the Petitioners) shall be

given a hearing and reasons shall be given for the decision. In

that regard, the argument advanced on behalf of the 4th

Respondent, i.e. that the disputed road is a public road in

accordance with the development Plan of the Matara Municipal

Council as gazetted in Gazette No.1645/22 dated 17.03.2010

and the Petitioners have no soil rights to the road, can inter alia

be taken into account. In that process, attention shall also be

drawn to the Rules in the old Gazette marked P8 in order to

reconcile them with the new Rules if there is any contradiction.

8

In summary, the Petitioners application is partly allowed. The

P28 Permit and P27 Plan shall not be quashed. The P31 Permit

is quashed by certiorari. The UDA can consider the 4th

Respondents application for subdivision afresh.

Let the parties bear their own costs.
