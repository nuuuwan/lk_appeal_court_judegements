Written Submissions: By the Respondent-Respondent-Appellants on

Argued on : 24/0212020

Judgment on : 10/07/2020

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Respondent-Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter- alia, to set aside the

order made by the Wakfs Tribunal dated 16/03/2019. When this case was taken up

for argument, the learned Counsel for the Appellants moved that the case be

decided on written submissions filed of record.

By this application, the Appellants seek to affirm the order of the Wakfs

Board dated 04/0112018, appointing the Appellants as Trustees of Muhiyadeen

Jumma Mosque, Katugoda, Galle for a period of 3 years effective from

0110512016. The Petitioner-Appellant-Respondents appealed against this order to

the Wakfs Tribunal and the appeal was allowed. The Appellants are before this

Court to have the said order made by the Wakfs Tribunal set aside.

By instrument of appointment of Trustees marked "P 1" issued under

Section 14(1) of the Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as amended) the Wakfs Board

appointed the Appellants as trustees of the Muhiyadeen Jumma Mosque for a

period of 3 years from 01105/2016 - 30104/2019. The order made by the Wakfs

Board dated 04/0112018, which the Appellants seek to uphold clearly states that

"the Board decides to accept the said election and appoint the members elected as

trustees for the period of 3 years commencing the date of election".

Therefore, in terms of the said instrument of appointment, all 5 Appellants

ceased to hold office on 30104/2019, as trustees of the said Muhiyadeen Jummah

Mosque.

In Halwan and Others Vs. Rahaman and Others (1993) 1 SLR 201,

Ananda Grero, J. held that,

"No doubt the Respondents-Respondents were not able to function as Trustees due

to certain actions taken by the Petitioners. Whatever may be the reason the fact

remains, that the term of office of the Respondents-Respondents expired on

25.06.91. According to Section 14(2)(a) of the Act, only a person appointed as a

Trustee shall officiate as Trustee for such period as provided for by the practices,

rules, regulations, or other arrangements in force for the administration of the

mosque ....... Therefore the provisions of the aforesaid section permit the trustees

to function for a period of three years. Once such period expires then again the

Page 4 of 5

Trustees have to be selected or nominated according to the practices, rules, etc.,

as contemplated in Section 14(J)(a) o/the Act. "

In the circumstances, all 5 Appellants have ceased to hold office on

30104/2019 as trustees of the said Jummah Mosque.

Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed without costs.

Parties in CA-RV -0112019, have agreed to abide by the judgment delivered

in this case.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

J agree.
