o I. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Ampara for

committing the offence of murder punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial,

the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced to death. This appeal was

preferred against the said conviction and sentence.

Grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant are;

I. The learned High Court Judge had believed the evidence of the eye witness (PWI)

Nandawathie, although her evidence fails the test of credibility and the test of

probability.

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by coming to the conclusion that the

other items of circumstantial evidence lead to the only inference of guilt of the

Accused Appellant.

3. The reason given by the learned High Court Judge to reject the evidence of the

Accused is unreasonable.

02. Prosecution mainly relied upon the evidence of the sole eye witness Nandawathie (PWI).

Appellant is the son-in-law of the PWI. Deceased is Nandawathie's daughter. According to

Nandawathie's testimony, the Appellant and the deceased as husband and wife were living in

their own house built by the Appellant, with their child. The deceased was pregnant and was

due to deliver the baby in few days. On the fateful night the Appellant had slept with his

daughter in one room and the witness Nandawathie had slept with the deceased in another.

Windows of the room was kept open on the request of the Appellant as it was warm. In the

night the deceased had shouted, '@~ qe01 0 ,t) e5J6 0l2l'i25)' (page 72). She had seen the

Appellant sitting on deceased's stomach covering his eyes with a small band. She had

recognized the Appellant from his upper body, face and the voice with aid of the light that

was on. When she asked the Appellant, 'geZ5i e002:S)~ 2:S)62l'ie2l'i?' (page 73), the Appellant

had put a cloth on her face, held her neck with his fingers and had threatened to kill her if she

shouted. She had recognized the voice of the Appellant. She further said that the Appellant

kept a knife on her neck. Appellant had asked the deceased for money saying, '~C(3 ~8~,

~C(3 ~8~' (page 73). Deceased had said, '~C(3 e~2l'i25) 062l'i25) 60" (page 73). Then the

deceased had said that her neck was cut. Appellant had gone inside the house.

Ground of Appeal No.1

03. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that PWI Nandawathie is not a credible witness

and that her evidence is improbable. Nandawathie had later implicated the Appellant as an

afterthought and that she had failed to tell the police initially that she identified the Appellant.

04. Learned DSG for the Respondent mainly depended on the circumstantial evidence. However,

counsel conceded that the contradiction marked as ' I V I' cannot be explained. It was the

contention of the learned DSG that PWI had lied to police due to fear and that her evidence is

reliable.

05. Learned Trial Judge after analyzing the evidence of the PWI Nandawathie, found her to be a

credible witness. Contention of the counsel for the Appellant is that PWI is not a credible

witness and also that her evidence is improbable. At the trial, PWI said that she recognized

the Appellant by the light and it was the Appellant who sat on the stomach of the deceased

and cut her neck. Further, to confirm her evidence about the identity of the Appellant, she

said that she asked the Appellant, ' geZ5i e0,2:S)~ 2:S)62l'ie2l'i?' (page 73 of the briel). After the

incident, she immediately had run to the neighbour called 'Fiscal Mama' (PW3) asking for

help. She had told PW3 that thieves had cut the neck of the deceased. According to PW I, the

3

reason for not telling the PW3 about Appellant cutting the deceased's neck was that she was

scared that the Appellant may have been around and that he would harm her.

06. When she went to the hospital, admittedly, she had told the hospital staff that thieves cut the

neck of the deceased. According to her testimony, she had not revealed about the Appellant

as she was scared again. She said that the cousin brother of the Appellant named

Sandanayake was around and that she was scared. The learned Trial Judge has accepted the

above reason to be genuine. In coming to that conclusion, the evidence given by the said

Sandanayake, has escaped the mind of the learned High Court Judge. Sandanayake (PW2) in

his evidence said that he suspected the Appellant and that he shouted that the Appellant may

have done it. ' 00 1!5 eDc,e D 25)l mwc Zil ~D e D251 25)~6l D zsl' e 251eD13 m,& lf13~ 15)0 13 e25)

25)eO Zil~C. 0 0 D,we25"f 6l~O 625) ~,em251 0 25)l mwem251 6l~, e6:iwcC)' (page 229). Therefore,

it is obvious that PWI did not have any reason to get scared of Sandanayake and to keep

without disclosing the Appellant at the hospital. It is clear that the PWI was not telling the

truth when she said that she was scared because PW2 was around and that she lied to

circumvent the situation of not disclosing the Appellant at the earliest.

07. It is also important to note that PWI had told the police that two persons with their faces

covered, asked for money from the deceased and cut her neck. She denied telling that to the

police and it was marked as V 1. She had no reason to fear in the presence of the police if she

really recognized the Appellant as the assailant.

08. She clearly said that the assailant asked for money from the deceased whilst being seated on

her stomach. Deceased had told the assailant not to kill her, that she would give him the

money. It is highly improbable for the Appellant to ask for money from his wife that way

making his identity by voice clear to the PWI who was sleeping beside the deceased. All

these factors make the evidence of PWI on the identity of the assailant doubtful and

improbable.

Hence, I am of the considered view that the Ground of appeal No.1 has merit.

Grounds of Appeal No.2 and 3

09. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that although the learned Trial Judge has said that he

takes into account the direct evidence as well as circumstantial evidence, learned High Court

Judge has failed to analyze the circumstantial evidence. The circumstances the learned Trial

Judge relied upon has not been explained. It was further submitted that it is unsafe to rely

upon the dying declaration alleged to have made by the deceased.

10. Learned DSG for the Respondent conceded that the contradiction marked as V 4 on the dying

declaration is not explained by the prosecution witnesses.

II. In his evidence, PW2 Sandanayake said that the deceased made a gesture from which he

understood that the Appellant cut her neck. He said that he asked the deceased, '(t1:si~1Si

~'l:il~ ~~Zl"i?' (page 227). Then the deceased had made the gesture to show that the neck

was cut and went off. '~2lj)~ q~Z5lZl"i ~~o,o1Si ~@c!C wow ~~w l:ilOC ql5f~~l:il 'Ude"owCl

228.

12. Then again, the witness said that in between someone asked, '(m@& 9Z5l' @l:il1?,. That gesture

was made in answering to that question. PW2 could not remember as to who posed that

question to deceased.

13. The person who posed that question also gave evidence at the trial. That was PWII Upali

Chandra Kumara. In the night PW3 had told him that thieves had cut the neck of the

deceased. He then had asked the deceased, '@l:il1 (m@&?' (page 20 I). Then the deceased had

made the gesture that he thought that she referred to the Appellant. However, in cross

examination it was elicited that in his statement to the police she had asked the deceased,

' 2l)o03@t& @'l:il1Si~ ~@Zl"i? @l:il1w,@&?'. Witness denied the 1st part of the question, '2l)o03@t&

@@> l:il1Si~ ~@Zl"i?' Page 208.

14. A dying declaration made on the basis of nods and gestures are not only admissible but

possesses evidentiary value. In case of The King V. Alisal/{liri 1 c.L.J 169, 7 c.L. W. 2 it was

held that nod of assent made by the deceased constituted a verbal statement within the

meaning of subsection (I) of section 32 of the Ceylon Evidence Ordinance No. 14 of 1895. In

'Alisandiri', the nod of assent was to a clear question.

IS. However, in the instant case on the evidence of PW2 as well as PWII, it is clear that two

questions were asked and that gesture was made by the deceased in reply. Therefore, it is

unsafe to conclude that the deceased made that gesture in reply to the question, 'C;;'I:S)1

CfJJ@&?' not to the question '25)oc13c;;d C;;J'I:S)1:5i~ ~C;;25'l?'

16. The infirmities of the unavailability of the witness (deceased) to testify and to be cross

examined also has to be taken into consideration when acting upon a dying declaration. In

case of Lallllhlwi Devc/wnd Shah V. State 0/ Glljarat [19711 3 SCC 767, para 8, it was

held;

"The law wilh regard 10 dying declaralions is very clear. A dying

declaration must be closely scrutinized as 10 its Irulh/ulness like any olher

importanl piece of evidence in Ihe lighl of Ihe surrounding facls and

circumslances of Ihe case, bearing in mind, on the one hand, Ihal Ihe

slatement is by a person who has not been examined in Court by oalh and, on

Ihe olher hand, Ihal Ihe dying man is normally nol likely 10 implicale innocent

persons falsely. "

17. However, in this instance, the issue is not whether that gesture was made or not by the

deceased, but in reply to which question posed to him was the gesture made. In the above

premise, it is unsafe to act upon the gesture made by the deceased as it is not clear as to

which question, she replied by that gesture.

18. The learned High Court Judge has not specifically mentioned the proved circumstances that

led to the conclusion on circumstantial evidence that it was the Appellant who committed the

murder and no one else. [n his Judgment learned High Court Judge said;

19. In case of Samantha V. Republic of Sri Lanka [2010[2 Sri L.R. page 236, it was held;

"In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn against the accused such inference must be the one and only irresistible

and inescapable inference that the accused com milled {he crime . ... "

The evidence on those circumstances should be proved circumstances.

20. In his Judgment, the learned High Court Judge has clearly misdirected himself on the

evidence of PW9, Nimalaraj who testified about the inquiry made by the Appellant on the

insurance policy of the Appellant and wife. The learned High Court Judge went on the

premise that the Appellant had inquired from the witness about the benefits that he would get

in the event the death of his wife. His evidence on that, in examination in chief itself was

totally different, and that has escaped the mind of the learned Trial Judge. At pages 341 and

342 the witness said;

21. Therefore, it is clear that the Appellant had inquired about the benefits they would receive in

the event of a childbirth. When he was informed that they would not get any benefit even for

a surgery for childbirth, he has got agitated and had asked the witness for the benefits he is

entitled to. On his own the witness had explained to the Appellant about the benefits he

would get on a death of the spouse. Witness clearly said that the Appellant did not ask about

the benefits he would get in the event of the death of a spouse, but on his own he explained.

The learned Trial Judge had gone on the wrong premise that the Appellant had inquired about

the benefits in the event of wife's death. Therefore, that piece of evidence of PW9 cannot be

taken against the Appellant as circumstantial evidence and the learned High Court Judge

erred in doing so.

22. As submitted by the counsel for the Appellant and conceded by the learned DSG for the

Respondent, the productions said to have recovered in terms of section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance were not produced in court as they were supposed to have got destroyed at the

Government Analyst Department. Therefore, learned Trial Judge did not have the advantage

of seeing them, especially to compare the two pieces of the knife, nor the defence had the

opportunity to observe them and to cross examine. Therefore, it was unsafe for the Trial

Judge to totally depend on the so-called comparison supposed to have made on the two pieces

of the knife by the investigators in the absence ofa Government Analyst Report.

23. Further, as submitted by the counsel for the defence the piece of cloth was never recovered in

terms of section 27. The certified extract of the portion of the statement made by the

Accused, submitted by the prosecution as P2 did not mention anything about a piece of cloth,

but about a sarong and a knife. Therefore, the piece of cloth said to be the cloth Accused

covered his eyes cannot be considered as a production recovered in terms of section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

24. Therefore, the above circumstances the learned High Court Judge has taken into

consideration as circumstantial evidence cannot be considered as proved circumstances to

come to the irresistible and inescapable conclusion that it was the Appellant and no one else

who committed the alleged offence.

25. It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that the learned Trial Judge has

unreasonably rejected the dock statement made by the Appellant. It is submitted that the

learned Trial Judge erred when he said in the Judgment that the Appellant did not suggest to

the police in cross examination that his statement was recorded under duress. As submitted

by the counsel for the Appellant, this position has been clearly suggested to the Investigating

Officer by the counsel for the Appellant (page 283 of the brief).

26. The Appellant in his evidence said that 'Rathu Aiya' asked him to go to the police station. He

said that, '~lS"l 1f2Sl6~ 6~ 1f8~, Zil~C' 62:iiG'2:illS"l' @C) w6~ C) @2Sl2:il lS"llW, . @C(3 1f8 G'o,~8~C)

'Machine Mudalali' who told that they should go to the police station. The fact remains that

the Appellant had wanted to go to the hospital, but someone has said to go to the police

station first. The learned Trial Judge has taken this into consideration to find the evidence of

the Accused inconsistent. The evidence of an Accused also has to be considered the same

way the court considers the evidence for the prosecution. As submitted by the counsel for the

Appellant, the learned Trial Judge has taken minor discrepancies in the evidence of the

Accused to find him to be incredible and inconsistent.

Hence the Grounds of appeal No.2 and 3 have merit.

27. In the instant case there are so many suspicious circumstances which led to the death of the

deceased. In case of Queell v. SlIlI/allaSellll 66 NLR 350, it was held;

10

"In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt.

Nor does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve {he

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give or call evidence. "

28. In the above premise, the sole eye witness Nandawathie is incredible. The other

circumstantial evidence the learned Trial Judge has taken into account are not sufficient to

come to an irresistible and inescapable inference that it was the Appellant but no one else

who caused the death orthe deceased.

For the reasons stated above, I find that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge against

the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, I acquit the Accused of the charge.

Appeal allowed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J
