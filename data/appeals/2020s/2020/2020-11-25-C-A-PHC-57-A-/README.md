filed by the I" Respondent-Appellant in the Magistrate's COUlt of

Wariyapola Case bearing No. 93853/EC/ 13.

Factual Background

121 The Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter re1erred to as the Respondent)

was an employee of the 2"" Hespondent-Appellant vV;u'iyapola Multi-

Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the 2""

Appell,mt). The I" Hespondent-Appellant (hereinafter refeITed to as the I"

Appell,mt), by virtue of powers vested in him under section 58(2) of dIe

Co-operative Societies Act No. 05 of 1972 as iUnended, referred a dispute

between dIe Hespondent iUld die 2'" AppelliUlt to ,m arbitrator.

131 The Arbiu'ator by his aWiU'd dated 14.02.2004 held dlat dIe Respondent

160, 131.62) togedler widl 20% interest dlereon per iU1I1Um, until die said

sum is paid in full.

1'11 T he Hespondent defaulted dIe paym ent of dIe aforesaid sum set out in

dIe iU'bitral award iUld die f" AppelliUlt, by virtue of ule powers vested in

him under section 59 (l) (c) of dIe Co-operative Societies Act issued dIe

certificate dated 25.09.2013 to die Magisu'ate's Court of W;u'iyapola under

Case beiU-ing o. 93853/EC/ 13. By ule said certificate, the I" AppelliUlt

claimed a total slim of Rs. ;[..50,553.00 payable as at 30.06.2013, which

5200/- as costs iUul a sum of Hs. 290,;[.2 1.38 as interest due fi-OIn dIe date

of Ule award to dIe date of ule filing of ule certificate.

Writ Application fIled in the High Court

161 During die pendency of dIe proceedings belore die Ma6ristrate's Court

of Wariyapola. die Respondent liled a Writ application be;u'ing No. HCW

01/2011 in die Provincial High Court 01' Kumnegala on 13.01.2014

seeking liller aiia. the lollowing relic Is:

(a) a writ of certiorari to quash the certificate filed by the I" Appell;mt in

the Magistrate's Court of W;u'iyapola;

(b) a stay order staying fiJrther proceedings liled in die Magistrate's

Court of Wariyapola in case bearing No. 9a85a/EC/ la on die basis

of die said certilicate liled by die I" Appell;mt in die said

Magistrate's Court until dIe conclusion of proceedings in dIe High

Court; ;md

(c) Costs.

171 Af"Ler inquilY, die 1e;mled High CourtJudge by order dated 29.02.2016

held dIat die I" Appell;mt had acted in excess of jurisdiction in issuing die

certificate dated 25.09.20 f :~ and issued a writ of certior;u'i quashing die said

certificate issued by dIe I" AppellaJlt to the Mahristrate's Court of

Wariyapola lor die lollowing reasons:

I. Sections 59 (I) (a) ;md 59 (I) (b) of dIe Co-operative Societies Act

No. 05 of I !J72 empower the Registr;u' who is die Commissioner of

Co-operative Development in terms of die provisions of d1e said

Act, to include hodl d1e ;ullount due ;mel die interest component in

dIe certilicate whereas section 5!) (I) (c) only empowers tlle Re6ristraJ'

to include in die certificate die amount due only ;md it excludes die

interest component;

( \ (PliO 00:;7/2016 ,\ C \ (1'110 00:;7/2016 11.< ,-h:urullegaia Ilew 0112014

2. The certificate issued by tIle Registr;u (1 st Appellant) contains the

particui;us of bodl die ,Ullount due ;uld dIe interest component

which is invalid in law ;uld dIUS, dIe Registrar had acted in excess of

jurisdiction in issuing die certificate dated 25.09.20 13 for die

recovery of die interest component Iiom dIe Magistrate's Court.

181 The learned High CourUudge, however, reserved dIe right of d1e I"

Appell<mt to file a correct celtificate in dIe Magistrate's Court of

W;u-iyapola.

Appeal to d1e Court of Appeal

191 Being aggrieved by die said order of dIe le;u-ned High COlut.Judge of

Kurunegala, die I" ;uld 2'" Appellants preferred d1ese two connected

appeals LO dlis Court.

Grounds of Appeals

II 01 At the he;u-ing die le;u-ned Counsel for die I" ;uld 2'" Appell;mts

submitted dlat die order of the learned High C01ll1.J udge of Kurunegala

dlat die I" Appell;ult had acted in excess of jurisdiction is erroneous for dIe

following reasons:

I. The learned High Court .Judge has failed to consider dlat

Respondent as a defaulter is liable LO pay die sum of Rs. 160,131.62

togedler widl interest dlereon, and dllIs, the I" Appellant had merely

enforced die s;ud award made by die arbitrator by exercising his

statutory powers vested in him under section 59 (1) (c) of dIe Act;

2. The le;u-ned High Court.Judge has failed to consider dlat section 59

(1) (c) C<Ulnot be read in isolation and dlat it ha~ to be read with

section 59 (1) of dIe Act, which defines die ternl 'de!ilulter' as a

person from whom a sum of money due as referred to in dIe award,

togedler widl costs ,md interest, d1at has not been p;ud.

1II1 On lhe other hand, thc le;mled Counsel fc)r the Respondent

submilted lhat die cerlilicate issued by die I" Appellate is inconsistent with

section 59 (J) (c) of die Co-operative Societies Act as section !i9 (J) (c) was

designed to recover only dlc principal amount due ,mel in del~lLllt, to

impose a penal sanction. He submilted that dle intention of P;u'liamenl in

providing die option in section 59 (J) (c) is to empower die Rcgislr;u' to

issue a certilicale to a Mal,'istrate ;md recover dle principal sum due from

die delilLllter and in delilLllt, to recover it by a line imposed by a sentencc

of die Magisu'ate.

1121 His contenlion was lhat accordingly, die I" Appellant could only have

included 111 lhe certilicatc llie principal sum due from dle delilLllter

specified 111 the award but die I" Appell;mt had included die inleresl

component of Rs. 290,-1.21311 in the certiticale, conu';u'y to section 59 (J)

(c) of lhe Acl. He submitted dlat the when die words of lhe subsection (c)

are cle;u' ;md un,unbiguous, llic rulcs of interpretation do not apply ;md

dlllS, die I" Appell;mt had acted in excess of his stalutory powers vesled in

him ;md included die interest component in die certilicate.

II :~I He submitted thaI under such circumstances, die ie;mled High COUIi

Judge was correcl in issuing die writ of certior;u'i quashing die certilicatc

issued by die 1st Appell;ml while reserving die right of die 1st Appell,ml to

file die correct certi/icate in die MagisU'ate's Court.

Grounds for Invoking a Writ of Certiorai

11-11 A writ of certiorari will be available whenever ;my body of persons

having legal audlority to determine questions affecting lhe rights of subjecls

;md having a duty 10 ael judiciaJly,

2. acts in violation of natural justice; or

3. where there is an error on the face of Ule proceedings.

11 51 In ule instant case, ule leamed High COllltJudge had issued a writ of

certiorari quashing Ule said certificate on the basis Ulat ule I" Appellant had

acted in excess of his statutory powers vested in him by section 59(1)(e) by

issuing a celtificate containing p;uticulars of boul ule principal amount and

ule interest when Ule I" Appellants' statlJtory powers iU'e limited under

subsection (c) to include only Ule principal sum of Rs. 160, 131.62 aJld not

ule interest component.

Issue on Appeal

11 61 In view of Ule aforesaid submissions, ulis COlllt is invited to consider

the following question:

I. 'vVheuler ule words "amount due" refelTed to in section 59 (I)

(c) of Ule Co-operative Societies Act No. 05 of 1972 ;L~ aJllended

me,lIlS aJ1<j include only "capital outstaJlding" and not ule

"interest" on Ule said amount;

2. If not, wheuler ule I" AppellaJlt had acted wiulin his statutory

powers vested in him under section 59 (I) (c) of ule Co-operative

Societies Act as amended by issuing a celtificate containing the

p,uticu);u's of ule principal ;unount together wiUl costs aJld

vested in him under section 58 of ule Act aJld ule arbitrator by aw,ml dated

1181 It is lIot in dispute (hat Ole Respondenl did not prefer any appeal to

Ole RegistTar in lellllS of Section 58 (:~) of Ole Act and OlliS, on 25.09.2013,

Ole RegistI<u' 0" Appellant) issued a certilicate to Ole Magistl'ate's Court of

1191 It is 10 be noted that Ole Section 59 (l) of Ole Act has provided three

alternative remedies li)r Ole recovery of the sum of money set out in Ole

award made under section 58 of die Act. A cursory reading of section 5C)

appropliate remedies provided in section 59 (I), The Registrar is thus

1211 The learned Counsel for the Respondent invited us to consider

subsection (c) of section 59(1) in isolation and hold dlat the intention of

P,u'Ii,U11ent in providing subsection (c) is to recover only the Plincipa.l

(A (PIIC) 00;;712016 A C\ (PIIC) 00;;712016 JI.C.- h:urunl'g~'hl IIC'W 01 /2014

;ullounl set out in the aw;u'd ,lI1d dIUS, where dIe Re!,'istTar decides to resOlt

to dIe remedy in subsection (c), he must forgo interest and claim only dIe

principal ,Ullount from the dd;nIlter ,lI1d in de!;lult, recover it as a tine

imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate.

1221 His contention was dlat tlle two remedies provided by dIe Legislature

in subsections (a) ,uHI (b) are distinct li'om the remedy provided in

subsection (c) ;lI1d while subsections (a) and (b) empowers the Re!,'istTar to

recover the principal sum togedler with the costs and interest, subsection

(c) is limited to dIe recovel), of dIe principal amount by way of a line

imposed by a sentence of the Ma/,ristTale.

12al It is to be noted that dIe Court's primal)' goal in intel1)reting statutes is

to hrive elfect to dIe legislative intent and tlle best evidence of dlat intent is

dIe statute's plain lall/,'l.lage. Accordingly, statutOl)' inteqJretation hehrins by

deriving me,lI1ing li'om the text of dIe statute as a statute is an edict of dIe

lehrislatllre alld the tl'aditional W,ly of interpreting a statute is to seek dIe

intention of its maker, dIe legislature (Vil}JIlu Pralap Sug,u' works (Plivalc)

LId. v. Chici1l1Spcctor orSlrullps, I ~ p., AIR 1968 SC 102, p. 101). Hence,

it is the duty of dIe COllii' to act upon dIe true intention of dIe le/,rislature or

the will of dIe le/,rislatllre, i.e. ,lI1 edict of the legislature (Maxwell on

Interpretation of Statutes, II ," Ed. p. I ).

1241 It is not dIe Illl1ction of dIe Courts dlUS, to USllIV legislative Illl1ction

under dIe disguise of interpretation alHI determine dIe mealling of a

provision based on dleir own preconceived notions (Bindra' Interpretation

of Statute, 10" ed. pp. !f.0:~-!f0!f.). The Courts must construe dIe word as

dley lind it and C;UlI1ot go outside dIe ambit of dIe section and speculate as

to what the lehrislature intended. (HcratiJ v. MOr!fiUl Engrilccnilg (Pvt)

l~illitcdSC Appeal No. 21 !fj 20 12-SC Minutes of 27.06.2013)

(\ (PliO 005712016 \ C \ (PIIC) 005712016 JI.c. - "u,.unl~"la IIC~' 01/2014

1251 The true intention of the legislature has to be g-ddlered and deciphered

in its proper spirit having due regard to dIe language used therein (Slate of

M1JaJaslilra v. M;uw;mjee F Des;u' & O/hel:\' (2002) SCC 318). Therefore,

it is harcl to ignore dIe legislative intent to 6..[ve definite meaning to words

employed in dIe Act ;md adopt an intel1Jretation which would tend to do

violence to dIe express laJlguage as well as dIe plain meaning, patent aim

and o~j ect underlying the v;u"ious other provisions of dIe Act

(BharadJJ;1das;m v. Universliy & Odlers v All India Council lor Technical

Education & Odlers (2001) 8 SCC (76).

1261 In dIe construction of a statute, it is impoi1aJlt (or dIe Courts to

ascertain dIe intention of dIe legislature in providing a provision in dIe Act

and for dlat purpose, the entire section including the scheme of the Act

that must be considered as a whole and in the context T he most fair ;md

rational medlOd for interpreting a statute is by exploring dIe intention of

Ule legislature through the most natural aJld probable signs which aJ"e eidler

the words, Ule context, dIe subject matter, the eHects ;mel consequences or

Ule spilit aJld reason of dIe law ( Bindra' Interpretation of Statute, 10di ed.

pp.403-404)"

1271 It is well-established dlerefore, dlat dIe intention of dIe legislature must

be found only by reading dIe slL1.tute as a whole aJlcl in order to asceltain

dIe meaJung of a provision of die statute, die statute must be read as a

whole, looking at what proceeds dIe prO\~ s ion and what succeeds it md not

merely dIe clause itself ((M;uuK L1i M?liJJ1Jd;u" v CouraJ7g;I C/WJriJa De)"

(2005) 2 SCC 400).

1281 Before I proceed to consider dIe meaJling of section 59 (l )(e), let me

reproduce me following statement made by Krishnaiyer J., held in Org;uJO

ciJelWCr1iS InriusIJies Ie Union oFfnr/ia 1980 SCR (I) 6 1 :

C \ (PIIC) 005712016 A C\ (PIIC) 0057/2016 H.C-Kul'uncgala IIC\\ 0112014

"J-;ach won/, phTase or sentence is 10 be considered ill tile light of tile general pllllJose of tile Act itself: A baIt: mech;Ulical liltelpretalion oFtile word5 devoid oFcollcept or fllllfJose will reduce m ost of legillalion 10 IilliiJiy. it i5 a salul;uy rule, well eslablishe(/, tilal tile liitelllioll of tile legi5lature must be found by readlilg tile statule as a whole ".

1291 Accordingly, section 59 (I) (c) ought to be read in its contenl, purpose,

the ellects, spirit, reason and consequences of the scheme of section 59(1)

of the Act. The oqjective of section 59 (I) is to recover the monies due

from the defaulter who h il~ litiled to honour tile award made by tile

arbitrator under section 58 by way of :~ alternative remedies set out ill

subsections (a), (b) ,U1d (c) of section 59 (I).

1301 Section 59 (I) provides the mechanism for tile recovery of tile sum

stated in the award from the defaulter together with costs and interest by

issuing a certificate to tile Government Agent etc., or Ule District COlllt or

the Ma!,>istTate's Co lilt . Section 59(1) states ulat where no appeal has been

duly made to the lk!,>istrar under section .'i8, ,Uld die aWiml "is that a sum

of money is due from one party to the dispute, and such sum together with

costs and interest, if ,my, has not been paid, ule Registnu" may in respect of

die piUty from whom such sum is due, hereinali:er in tilis section called

"dditulter", issue a certificate by one of die dlree remedies in subsections

(a) or (b) or (c).

under section 59 (I), the Re!,>istrar is entiued to resOIt to one of tile

remedies provided in subsections (a) to (c) of section 59 (I) ,md seek to

recover ule sum due from die delillliter together with costs and interest,

which has not been paid by such defaulter.

1321 The term "delilulter" is described in section 59 (I) as "tile party li"om

whom such sum is due" and such sum specilied in section 59 (I) is ule sum

C \ (1'1Ie) 005712016 \ C \ (I'IIC) 005712016 II.('.-h.urunel!.ala II( \\ 01 /2014

of money due from such defaulter, together WiUl costs ,md interest (Vide-

first p,u-t of section 59 (1).

1331 As noted, Ule decision of ule arbitrator in ule present case, as set out

in ule award is Ulat ule Respondent is liable to pay a total sum of Rs.

160, 131.62 which includes ule principal sum of Rs. 154,93 1.62 and a sum

of Rs. 5200/- as costs, together with interest on the said total sum of Rs.

154,931.62 at the rate of 20% per annum until payment in full.

1341 The legislative intent contained in subsection (c) of section 59( I) of Ule

Co-operative Societies Act C;U1I10t be gaulered by adopting a restrictive

interpretation to its words wiUIOUt ascertaining Ule legislative intent by

reading section 59(1) in its entirety, ule context, oqject, purpose ,md its

operation wiulin ule overall scheme of section 59(1) enacted by Ule

Legislature.

1351 The restI-ictive interpretation given by ule learned High CourtJudge to

section 59 (1) (c) of ule Act U lat all what Gm he recovered from ule

defaulter is the Plincipal iUTIOunt and not ule interest component is

contI-iuy to ule purpose, object:ive, spirit imel effect of Ule entire section 59

(1) of ule Act. That interpretat:ion in my view is totally against Ule intention

of ule legislature specified in section 59 (1) of ule Act.

1361 In my view, Ule "amount due" in subsection (c) is clearly Ule

Plincipal amount due under Ule award of Ule arbitI-ator togeuler wiUl costs

and interest as section 59(1) clearly provides that ule RegistI-ar is entiued to

issue ule certificate uneler any of Ule remedies in subsections (a)-(c) seeling

to recover a sum of money due from one party to the dispute to another

party to the dispute, together with costs and interest, if any, has not been

paid.

1371 When ilie intention of Ule legislature in providing subsection (c) must

be found by reading ule Plincipal provision i.e. section 59(1) as a whole

C \ (PIIC) 0057/2016 II.C.-Kurunegaln IIC\\ 0112014

including the context, purpose, dIe ellect ,Uld the spirit, as a whole, it is

crystal cle,u" dIal dIe ";UllOunt due" in subsection (c) includes dIe sum

stated in dIe aw,u"d of dIe ;u"bitrator, which is dle "sum of money due from

the def;tulter, together with costs and interest that has not been paid" by

such def;mlter as contemplated by dIe Legislature in dIe lirst part of section

59(1 ).

1381 Moreover, dIe intention of tlle legislature in providing subsection (c)

without limiting to dlC principal amount GUl also be ascertained by reading

section 59 (4) as ,u1lended by Act No. II of 1992, which empowers a

Magistrate, in his discretion, to make order to recover any sum of money

mentioned in the certificate specified in section 59 (1) (c) in addition to

sentencing dIe dehUllter to a term of imprisonment in default of dIe line

imposed as contemplated by section 29 1 (2) of dle Code of Criminal

Procedure.

1;(21 The intention or tlle le/,>1slature in iUllending subsection ;f. of section 59

(I) by Act I o. 1101' 1992 is to empower a Magistrate to recover any SUlll or

money mentioned in tlle certificate specilied in section 59(1)(c), even

tllOugh such delilUlter is scntended to a term or imprisonment in delault or

tlle line imposed in acconl;Ulce witll section 291 or die Code or Criminal

Procedure Code lor the liulure to pay ;Uly sum of money due upon ;Ul

;u-bitral award made under section 58.

1;j31 Section !i9 (1) (;j.) read witll section 291 (2) empowers die Magistrate

to issue a w;uT;u1l addressed to die fiscal or die COUlL for die levy of die

said amount by distress iuul sale or any movable property belonging to the

delilUlter imd recover such sum or money mentioned in die certilieate

specilied in section 59 (2) (see).

1441 The intention or die Legislature as set out in section 59(1) (c) read

widl section 59(1) is to empower die RegistT<u- to issue a certificate to a

Magistrate containing Piu-ticuliu-s or the amount due, which is ;lIIY sum of

money due Ii-om die delaulter as specilied in die aw;ml made by die

iu-bitTator togedler widl costs and interest that has not been paid by die

deIaulter.

1451 It is absolutely cleiu- dlat the words "Piu-ticulars or die iUllount due" in

section 59 (I) (c) includcs imy sum 01' money due Ii-om die deIaulter

togedler with costs ;uHl interest as clciu-ly re1erred to in section 59 (1) or die

Act and not merely die principal ;U11tlUnt due, as elToneously held by dlc

learned High COUlL.J udge.

1;jGI The restrictive interpretation given by tJle learned High COUlL Judge to

section 59(1 )(e) re1erring only to the principal SUI1l excluding die interest

component would tend to de1eat the intention of the Leb>1slatlJre illld do

(\ (1'1100057/2016 \ C\ (Pl1Cl0057/2016 11.C-"uI'Ul,,~a l " lIe\\ 01 /20 14

violence to the express language, oQject and patent aim specified in section

59(1) in recovering the sum of money due from a defaulter together with

costs and interest, that has not been paid by such defaulter.

1471 It is apt at this stage to reler to dIe following dictum of Atkin LJ. in R.

fl. l:.lectricity Commissioner ex. p. London Eiecuicity JO/ilf Committee Co.,

(1920) (1920) I K.B. 171 widl reg.u-d to dIe scope of certiorari and

circumstances under which d1e certiorari is available:

"Whenever any body oFpenons liavzilg leg-di autlioniy to deten711ile quesa"ollS a.fltxting dIe light., oFsubjects, and /i;lfIJilg die duty to act judicially, act IiI excess oFdleli-legal audwniy, dley;ue: subject to die

cOllu-olhilg jlJli5dica"on 0/ die King's Bench division exercised Iii dlese wnts. '~ 1481 Accordingly, d1e ceniorari will be issued to quash all actions which are

ultra. fIlie:s or done in excess of legal audlOrity in d1e following

circul11sGUlces:

I. doing dIe wrong dling (substantive ulurz Vlie:s) ;

2. doing dIe right thing in dIe wTOng way (proceduralulu;1 fllie:s);

3. doing dIe right dling in dIe right way for a wrong purpose or wrong

objective.

1491 As a certiorari is a discretionary remedy, dIe wlit court's jurisdiction to

interfere widl statutory discretionary powers are limited and accordingly,

the interference widl such statutory powers has to be confined to dlOse

cases only where dIe COUli comes to dIe conclusion dlat dlere has been

eidler no exercise of discretion or dlat dIe discretion has been exercised on

extraneous considerations, nor on melits, but capriciously, arbitrarily or

male fide (Amar Nadl Khurana. fl. Appellate Asst C I. T, ILR (J 969) I

Pun. 363).

CA (PIIC) 0057/2016 f\ C.\ (PI-Ie) 00:;7/2016

150 I As noted, in the instant case, the Registr;u' in issuing the certificate

under section 59 (I) (c) of the Act had acted within his statutOIY powers

and exercised his discretion in issuing the certificate containing particul,u's

of die ;unount due from tlle deliluher, togedler widl costs ;u1(l interest as

empowered by section 59 (I) of die Act.

1511 In die present cae, ule Respondent had not satisfied Ulat the ReI,ristTar

had acted in excess of his legal auulOrity when he issued ule certificate to

die MabrislTate of W,u'iyapola, containing p,u1:iculars of ule ,mlount due

li'om the defaulter as set out in ule aw;u'd made under section 58, togeUler

widl costs ,md interest, ulat has not been paid by dle defaulter.

1521 The le;u'ned High Courl.Judge has cle,u'ly erred in interpreting section

59(1 )(c) of ule Co-operative Societies Act referring only to the principal

sum due ,md not the interest thereon without reading section 59 as a whole

;uld its general purpose, ol~ject, aim, spirit underlying ule enlorcement

mech;ulism provided in sectioll 59 of tJle Act.

Conclusion

1531 For diose reasons, tJle judgment of the le;u'ned High CourtJudge of

Kurunegala dated 29.02.20 I (i is set aside ,md both Appeals bearing Nos.

CA (PHC) 57/2016 A ,md CA (pH C) 57/2017 ,u'e allowed.
