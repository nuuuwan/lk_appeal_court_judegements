Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner, an English teacher employed by the Department of

Education functioning under the Ministry of Education of the

Central Provincial Council, filed this application against the

Respondents seeking to quash by a writ of certiorari the decisions

contained in P10, P13, P15, whereby her request/appeal for

reinstatement to her teaching post was refused, and to compel the

1st-3rd Respondents by a writ of mandamus to grant no pay leave

to her for the period she was overseas, and to allow her to resume

duties.

4

At the time material to this application, the Petitioner had been

serving as a teacher at Kandy Sarasavi Uyana Maha Vidyalaya.

Her husband, a professor at the Faculty of Engineering of the

Peradeniya University, had been granted overseas leave (vacation

and sabbatical) from November 2008-November 2010 to work at

the University of Malaysia, Malaysia. On 15.12.2008, the

Petitioner had accompanied her husband to Malaysia, with their

two young children aged four and two and a half years old. She

returned to Sri Lanka in October 2011. Her attempt to report for

work thereafter was turned down on the basis that her overseas

leave application submitted in November 2008 had not been

approved.

The Petitioner made several unsuccessful requests/appeals for

reinstatementvide P9, P11, P12, P14, P16.

By P10, P13 and P15, the Provincial Director of Education, the

Provincial Public Service Commission and the Governor of the

Central Province, respectively, refused her application for

reinstatement. It is significant that in P10, P13 and P15the

decisions sought to be quashed in the instant applicationno

reasons have been given for refusal.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents

stated at the argument that it is common ground that the

Petitioners requests/appeals were rejected because the Petitioner

had not followed the proper procedure and obtained overseas

leave prior to leaving the country, thereby acting in violation of

the provisions of the Establishment Code and circulars/letters

issued by the Chief Secretary of the Central Provincial Council.

5

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General drew the attention of the

Court to the circulars/letters marked R6-R10 tendered by the

Respondents to emphasise that (a) the officer shall apply for

overseas leave not less than three months before leaving the

country; (b) it is the personal responsibility of the officer to get

leave approved before leaving the country; and (c) officers who fail

to comply with these provisions are liable to disciplinary action.

It is significant that these circulars/letters marked R6-R10 have

been issued in the years 2004, 2006 and 2007.

The Petitioner with her counter affidavit tendered the

circular/letter issued by the Chief Secretary in September 2008

marked P19. This circular/letter had been issued prior to the

Petitioner submitting her leave application. According to this

circular/letter, an officer shall hand over a duly filled application

to the Zonal Director 14 days before an overseas journey, and the

Zonal Director shall if the application is in order immediately send

it to the Provincial Director with his recommendations, and the

Provincial Director shall tender it to the Secretary to the

Provincial Ministry for final approval.

From the documents tendered by the Respondents themselves

there is no doubt that the Petitioner complied with her time limit.

From R3 and R4 the Zonal Director admits that the Petitioner

handed over her leave application to his office in November 2008.

As the Zonal Director in R4 informed the Petitioner that her leave

application had been sent to the Provincial Director on

05.11.2008, it is clear that the Petitioner submitted the duly

6

completed application before 05.11.2008. The Respondents do

not dispute that the Petitioner left the country on 15.12.2008.

Hence the argument of learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

(which is based on the old circulars/letters) that the Petitioner did

not tender her leave application three months before leaving the

country and therefore her leave application should not have been

entertained is unsustainable.

According to R3 and R4, even one year after the Petitioners leave

application had been submitted by the Zonal Director to the

Provincial Director, there was no response from the latter. By R3,

about one year after the application had been tendered, the Zonal

Director informed the Petitioner, who was presumably abroad at

that time, to get personally involved/take a personal interest in

getting her leave approved. R3 dated 08.09.2009 reads as follows:

2008.12.01 2009.12.01

/

2008

.

This is a very sad state of affairs and in my view such attitudes of

Government bureaucrats encourage bribery and corruption. If

the Provincial Director wanted to refuse the leave application, he

could have done so by giving reasons. It is regrettable that until

now the Petitioners leave application has not been refused. There

is no document refusing her leave application.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General in his submission drew

the attention of the Court to R4 and R5 as documents by which

7

the Petitioners leave application was refused. I regret my

inability to agree with that contention. Let me explain.

Initially the Petitioner had applied for leave for one year

November 2008 to November 2009. Thereafter, while being

abroad, she had sought an extension of leave for another one

yearfrom 06.12.2009 to 06.12.2010. The Zonal Director by R4

refused the application for extension. On what basis did he

refuse it? It was refused on the basis that approval from the

Provincial Director for the Petitioners previous leave application,

sent more than one year prior, had not been received.

2008.12.01 2009.12.01

2008.11.05

2009.11.13

2009.12.06 2010.12.06

.

Is this a reasonable basis to reject her second application? In my

judgment, it is not. The Petitioner is not responsible for the

inaction on the part of the Provincial Director in respect of her

first application.

The pivotal argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner is that although she was not allowed to report for duty

upon her return to Sri Lanka, she was not sent on vacation of

post nor was she informed that she had been dismissed from

service. There is no written communication sending the Petitioner

on vacation of post. Learned Presidents Counsel points out that

this is a blatant procedural irregularity, which attracts the

8

invocation of the writ jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the

validity of subsequent decisions impugned in this application.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner drew the attention

of the Court to P18 Gazette containing Procedural Rules issued

by the Public Service Commission dated 20.02.2009, which

stipulates the procedure relevant to Vacation of Post applicable

to officers of the Public Service.

Section 172 of P18 reads as follows:

A Public Officer who absents himself from duty without

informing his Head of Institution as mentioned in Section 171

above shall be deemed to have vacated his post on his own

accord. It shall be the duty of his Appointing Authority or

Head of Department or Head or Provincial/District/Divisional

Head of Department or Head of Institution to inform the

officer forthwith as per Appendix 12 by registered post. If the

vacation of post notice is issued by an authority other than

the Appointing Authority, he shall send copies of the notice to

the Appointing Authority and to other relevant authorities.

Section 174 reads thus:

Where the person who vacated post volunteers an

explanation in writing to the officer who was the Disciplinary

Authority during his time in the public service within three

months of the date the vacation of post notice the

Disciplinary Authority shall consider his explanation in terms

of the respective disciplinary rules. Having considered his

explanation, the Disciplinary authority may reinstate him

9

with or without punishment or refuse such reinstatement.

The Disciplinary Authority shall record the reasons for his

decision in the respective file clearly and accurately in detail.

Further, he shall formally communicate his decisions to the

said person.

In the first place, the Petitioner did not absent herself from duty

without informing her Head of Institution. Even assuming she

did, according to section 172 quoted above, it is the duty of the

Head to inform the officer by registered post forthwith that the

officer is deemed to have vacated her post. Thereafter, the officer

can, within three months of the vacation of post notice, give an

explanation seeking reinstatement to the Disciplinary Authority.

The said Authority could reinstate her with or without

punishment or refuse such reinstatement, but shall give reasons

for the decision clearly and accurately in detail.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General submits that R4 and R5 satisfy

this requirement. In other words, it is his submission that R4

and R5 are vacation of post notices/letters. I am not inclined to

agree. Undoubtedly R4, which I quoted above, does not contain

even a clue with regard to sending the Petitioner on vacation of

post. R5 contains a clue. By R5, the Zonal Director informed the

Petitioner that unless she reports for duty after the period

relevant to the initial application (01.12.2008-01.12.2009), she

would be treated as having vacated her post. In my view, there is

no definite decision in R5 stating that the Petitioner would be

deemed to have vacated her post after a specific date. It cannot

be considered a vacation of post notice. The heading of the letter

10

speaks for itselfit is regarding approval for extension of leave.

Let me quote the contents of the letter for better understanding.

.

As I stated earlier, by R5, the request for extension of leave was

refused on a wrong basis, i.e. the delay in approval of the

Petitioners initial leave application.

If a vacation of post notice is served, according to section 174 in

P18, the officer is entitled to an opportunity to offer an

explanation for reinstatement. Therefore serving of such notice is

not a mere formality but peremptory.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General argues that even if a

vacation of post notice had not been served, no prejudice was

caused to the Petitioner because she had tendered a detailed

explanation seeking reinstatement to the Provincial Director

through the Zonal Director by P9, and, when this had been

refused, the Petitioner appealed giving extensive reasons by P11

to the Secretary of the Subject Ministry, by P12 to the Public

Service Commission, by P14 to the Governor, and by P16 to the

Human Rights Commission.

11

For the time being I will accept this argumentR5 is the vacation

of post letter and the said documents are the explanations of the

Petitioner seeking reinstatement, and P10, P13 and P15 are the

decisions made by the relevant authorities refusing reinstatement.

The next question relates to the reasons for the said decisions.

There are no stated reasons in any of those decisions except to

say that the Petitioners request/appeal was refused (due to non-

acceptance of her explanation).

Public law remedies such as writs of certiorari and mandamus are

largely, if not solely, based on principles of natural justice. The

first principle of natural justice is: Hear both sides before taking a

decision. This is known as the audi alteram partem rule, which

runs across-the-board in the whole spectrum of the decision-

making process as a golden thread, irrespective of whether it is a

regular Court, quasi-judicial body, administrative tribunal and

the like. Hearing both sides does not end the matter. After the

hearing, the deciding authority shall give reasons for the decision

made, for otherwise nobody would know why the said decision

was taken. The aggrieved party has a right to know the reasons

for the decision, at least to decide whether to challenge the

decision by appeal/judicial review. If the decision is challenged,

the Court shall know the basis for the impugned decision to

ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the decision. When the

original decision is empty, what can the Court do other than

declaring that there is no decision to review in the eyes of the law

and therefore the purported decision is a nullity, unless, at least,

the reasons for the said decision, which were originally withheld

for some reason, are later submitted to Court.

12

Although there was a prior tendency to lean towards the view that

[n]either the Common Law nor principles of natural justice require

as a general rule that administrative tribunals or authorities should

give reasons for their decisions that are subject to judicial review1,

the general trend in modern administrative law is an increasing

acceptance of the importance of giving reasons for decisions, and

a rejection of the aforesaid traditional view. Although there is no

explicit general rule included in the principles of natural justice,

Wade vigorously supports the view in favour of giving reasons.

The principles of natural justice do not, as yet, include any

general rule that reasons should be given for decisions.

Nevertheless there is a strong case to be made for the giving

of reasons as an essential element of administrative justice.

The need for it has been sharply exposed by the expanding

law of judicial review, now that so many decisions are liable

to be quashed or appealed against on grounds of improper

purpose, relevant consideration and errors of law of various

kinds. Unless the citizen can discover the reasoning behind

the decision, he may be unable to tell whether it is

reviewable or not, and so he may be deprived of the

protection of the law. A right to reasons is therefore an

indispensable part of a sound system of judicial review.

Natural justice may provide the best rubric for it, since the

giving of reasons is required by the ordinary mans sense of

1 Yaseen Omar v. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation [1999] 2 Sri LR 375 (SC), vide also Kusumawathie v. Aitken Spence Co. Ltd. [1996] 2 Sri LR 18, Sportsman Tea (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commissioner General of Labour [2006] 1 Sri LR 93 and the cases cited at 6-8 in Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner of Elections [2009] 1 Sri LR 1

13

justice. It is also a healthy discipline for all who exercise

power over others.2

To my mind, the notion that there is no principle of natural

justice that a tribunal or an administrative authority should give

reasons for its decision, is inherently incoherent. Natural justice

unequivocally demands that administrative authorities give

reasons for their decisions.3 What is Natural Justice? In its

broadest sense natural justice may mean simply the natural sense

of what is right and wrong and even in its technical sense it is now

often equated with fairness.4

If natural justice does not require giving reasons for decisions, at

least, fairness does. Explaining the relationship between reasons

and fair treatment, Galligan states that giving reasons for

decisions is a means of determining whether power has been

exercised properly and whether parties have been treated fairly:

the underlying principle of fair treatment is that a party be treated

according to authoritative standards, and the giving of reasons is a

means to that end.5

According to Wade, as I have quoted above, failure to give reasons

for a decision amounts to deprivation of the protection of the law.

Article 12(1) of our Constitution recognises the equal protection

of the law as a fundamental right. This means, empty decisions

2 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law, 11th Ed. (2014), Oxford University Press, pp. 440-441 3 Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority [2005] 3 Sri LR 262, Kegalle Plantations Ltd. v. Silva [1996] 2 Sri LR 180 4 Wade & Forsyth, op. cit., p.374 5 D.J. Galligan, Due Process and Fair Procedures: A Study of Administrative Procedures (1996), Clarendon Press, Oxford, p.432

14

devoid of reasons not only give rise to invoking the writ

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, but also the fundamental

rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

This was considered in the case of Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner

General of Elections6 where the Commissioner General of

Elections refused to register the Petitioners new party as a

recognised political party, as he was statutorily empowered to do,

but without giving reasons. The Petitioners came before the

Supreme Court complaining that their fundamental right

guaranteed by Article 12(1) for equal protection of the law was

violated thereby.

Bandaranayake J. (later C.J.) at page 16 held:

The Petitioners had complained of the infringement of their

fundamental right guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Article 12(1) of the Constitution deals with the

right to equality and reads as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the

equal protection of the law.

Equality, which could be introduced as a dynamic concept,

forbids inequalities, arbitrariness and, unfair decisions. As

pointed out by Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) in E. P.

Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu AIR (1974) SL 555

From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to

arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn

6 [2009] 1 Sri LR 1

15

enemies, one belongs to the rule of law in a Republic while

the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch.

In such circumstances to deprive a person of knowing the

reasons for a decision, which affects him would not only be

arbitrary, but also a violation of his right to equal protection

of the law.

Wade continues:

Notwithstanding that there is no general rule requiring the

giving of reasons, it is increasingly clear that there are many

circumstances in which an administrative authority which

fails to give reasons will be found to have acted unlawfully.

The House of Lord has recognised a perceptible trend

towards an insistence on greater opennessor transparency

in the making of administrative decisions and consequently

has held that where, in the context of the case, it is unfair not

to give reasons, they must be given.7

According to Wade it is always possible that the failure to give

reasons for a decision may justify the inference that the decision

was not taken for a good reason.8

In R v. Secretary for Trade and Industry ex parte Lonrho Plc9, Lord

Keith stated that if all other known facts and circumstances

appear to point overwhelmingly in favour of a different decision, the

decision-maker, who has given no reasons, cannot complain if the

7 Op. cit., p.441 8 Op. cit., p.442 9 [1989] 1 WLR 525 at 540

16

court draws the inference that he had no rational reason for his

decision.

Failure to give reasons is a denial of justice.

In Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantations (Pvt) Ltd v. Central Bank of

Sri Lanka,10 Sripavan J. (later C.J.) held:

In the absence of reasons [by the Controller of Exchange], it

is impossible to determine whether or not there has been an

error of law. Failure to give reasons therefore amounts to a

denial of justice and is itself an error of law.

In R v Mental Health Review Tribunal-ex parte Clatworthy

(1985) 3 All ER 699 it was held that reasons should be

sufficiently detailed as to make quite clear to the parties and

specially the losing party as to why the tribunal decided as it

did and to avoid the impression that the decision was based

upon extraneous consideration rather than the matter raised

at the hearing.11

Failure to give reasons suggests arbitrariness.

Bandaranayake J. (later C.J.) in the Supreme Court case of

Choolanie v. Peoples Bank12 observed:

On a consideration of our case law in the light of the attitude

taken by Courts in other countries, it is quite clear that giving

reasons to an administrative decision is an important feature

10 [2004] 2 Sri LR 133 11 Vide also the Judgment of Sripavan J. in Benedict v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka [2003] 3 Sri LR 68 12 [2008] 2 Sri LR 93 at 105-106

17

in todays context, which cannot be lightly disregarded.

Furthermore, in a situation, where giving reasons have been

ignored, such a body would run the risk of having acted

arbitrarily in coming to their conclusion.

In the Supreme Court case of Karunadasa v. Unique Gems Stones

Ltd,13 the 2nd Respondent Commissioner made a formal decision

upon the recommendations of the 1st Respondent Assistant

Commissioner, but there were no reasons stated in the decision of

the Commissioner. Mark Fernando J. on behalf of the Supreme

Court stated:

To say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does

not mean merely that his evidence and submissions must be

heard and recorded; it necessarily means that he is entitled

to a reasoned consideration of the case which he presents.

And whether or not the parties are also entitled to be told the

reasons for the decision, if they are withheld, once judicial

review commences, the decision may be condemned as

arbitrary and unreasonable; certainly, the Court cannot be

asked to presume that they were valid reasons, for that

would be to surrender its discretion. The 2nd Respondents

failure to produce the 3rd Respondents recommendation

thus justified the conclusion that there were no valid

reasons, and that Natural Justice had not been observed.

The fact that the 3rd Respondent held a fair inquiry and

otherwise acted within jurisdiction does not excuse the

failure to give reasons.

13 [1997] 1 Sri LR 256

18

The case was, accordingly, remitted to the Court of Appeal to re-

hear, after calling for and examining the record and the

recommendations made by the Assistant Commissioner to the

Commissioner.

In Ceylon Printers Ltd v. Commissioner of Labour14, the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour after a prolonged inquiry decided that

the termination of employment of the workmen had been for

disciplinary reasons and recommended to the Commissioner that

the application of the Union be dismissed. However, the Deputy

Commissioner, when requested by the Commissioner to consider

and report on the findings of the Assistant Commissioner who

held the inquiry, had taken into account new materialnamely a

judgment of the Court of Appeal where it had been held that an

employee can be dismissed on disciplinary grounds as a

punishment only after a disciplinary inquiryto disagree with the

recommendation of the Assistant Commissioner as, according to

the Deputy Commissioner, no such disciplinary inquiry had been

held by the employer in this instance. This the Deputy

Commissioner did without affording an opportunity to the

employer to be heard. The Commissioner agreed with the Deputy

Commissioner and ordered the reinstatement of the workmen

with back wages. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Counsel for

the Commissioner conceded that at the point of departure the

employer should have been given an opportunity of challenging

the new material. But Counsel contended that there was no duty

on the Commissioner to have given reasons for his Order in the

absence of a statutory requirement to do so.

14 [1998] 2 Sri LR 29

19

The Bench of the Supreme Court, adorned by G.P.S. De Silva

C.J., Wijetunga J. and Gunasekera J., having referred to a spate

of authorities including Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd.

(supra), held that the Commissioner was acting in breach of the

principles of natural justice when he (a) failed to give an

opportunity to the employer to challenge the new material on

which he acted; and (b) failed to give reasons for his decision,

particularly in view of the fact that it was not he who held the

inquiry and recorded the evidence.

In Kusumawathie v. Aitken Spence Co. Ltd.15 S.N. Silva J. (later

C.J.) stated:

There is no requirement in law to give reasons should not be

construed as a gateway to arbitrary decisions and orders. If

a decision that is challenged is not a speaking order,

(carrying its reasons on its face), when notice is issued by a

Court exercising judicial review, reasons to support it have to

be disclosed with notice to the Petitioner. Rule 52 of the

Supreme Court Rules 1978, is intended to afford an

opportunity to the Respondents for this purpose. The reasons

thus disclosed form part of the record and are in themselves

subject to review.

When shall the decision-maker give reasons? He shall give

reasons at the time of making the decision unless there is an

agreement to the contrary. Can failure to give reasons be

remedied by giving reasons later? The answer shall be in the

negative. If reasons have been given but not communicated to the

15 [1996] 2 Sri LR 18 at 28

20

party concerned, the situation is different. In such a situation,

once the appeal/judicial review is put in motion, the decision-

maker can tender those reasons to Court, as suggested by Mark

Fernando J. in Karunadasa v. Unique Gems Stones Ltd (supra),

and S.N. Silva J. in Kusumawathie v. Aitken Spence Co. Ltd

(supra). If reasons are suggested for the first time in Court, the

tendency is to reject them as afterthoughts.

In Wijepala v. Jayawardena,16 Mark Fernando J. went so far as to

say:

Although openness in administration makes it desirable that

reasons be given for decisions of this kind, in this case I do

not have to decide whether the failure to do so vitiated the

decision, However, when this Court is requested to review

such a decision, if the Petitioner succeeds in making out a

prima facie case, then the failure to give reasons becomes

crucial. If reasons are not disclosed, the inference may have

to be drawn that this is because in fact there were no

reasonsand so also, if reasons are [now] suggested, they

were in fact not the reasons, which actually influenced the

decision in the first place.

Wade explains the position in this way:

Thus the question arises whether a failure to give reasons at

or about the time of the disputed decision, may be remedied

by reasons given much later in the Respondents affidavit

responding to the grant of permission. If the duty to give

16 SC 89/95 SCM of 30.06.1995 cited in Hapuarachchi v. Commissioner of Elections [2009] 1 Sri LR 1 at 12

21

reasons is an element of natural justice, the failure to give

reasons, like any other breach of natural justice, should

render the disputed decision void. And a void decision could

not be validated by late reasons even if they show that the

decision was justified. Consistent with this analysis the

Court of Appeal has quashed a decision that an applicant

was intentionally homeless notwithstanding that the bad

reasons given when the decision was made were

supplemented by good reasons given in the Respondents

affidavit. It is not ordinarily open, the Court of Appeal said

in another case, to a decision maker, who is required to give

reasons, to respond to a challenge by giving different or

better reasons. There is always the danger that the decision-

maker in giving supplementary reasons may drift perhaps

subconsciously, into ex post facto rationalisation of the

decision. Thus decision-makers should not be given a

second bite at the cherry. European law requires reasons to

be given with the decision.17

Coming back to the facts of the instant case, it may be recalled

that section 174 in P18 casts a mandatory duty on the

Disciplinary Authority to give reasons. If I may repeat, it says

The Disciplinary Authority shall record the reasons for his decision

in the respective file clearly and accurately in detail. I emphasise

clearly and accurately in detail. But the Provisional Director of

Education by P10, the Secretary to the Public Service Commission

by P13 and the Governor by P15 gave no reasons for their

decisions to turn down the request/appeal of the Petitioner. The

17 Op. cit., p.445

22

reason given by learned Deputy Solicitor General relying on the

old circulars is factually inaccurate. Hence there exists a strong

case in favour of the Petitioner on this ground.

The Petitioner has established her claim. I grant the reliefs to the

Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs (b)-(d) of the prayer to the

petition and quash the impugned decisions contained in P10, P13

and P15 by certiorari.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner candidly admitted

that the Petitioner is also at fault for not having ensured approval

of her leave prior to going abroad.

In the Petitioners appeal to the Governor in P14, she accepts in

the concluding paragraph that she was wrong to have left the

country without written approval of her leave, but requests

leniency in the circumstances of this case.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General drawing attention to

paragraph 5 of the statement of objections of the 4th-10th

Respondents says: (a) as seen from R1, the Petitioner was sent on

vacation of post with effect from 01.06.1992 due to her failure to

report to work, but was reinstated with effect from 24.08.1995 as

seen from R2; (b) from 09.06.1997 to 01.07.1997 she failed to

report for duty without obtaining leave; and (c) from 30.01.2007

to 24.01.2008 she obtained overseas leave.

This means the Petitioners track record is not altogether

impressive. Writ being a discretionary relief, the conduct of the

party applying plays a pivotal role in deciding the matter.

However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the severity

23

of the breach by the Respondents outweighs the past

reproachable conduct of the Petitioner.

The relief prayed for in paragraph (e) is also granted, subject to

the condition that if there is no vacancy in the relevant school,

the authorities can decide on a school where the Petitioner can

resume her duties. To avoid any ambiguity, let me say that she is

not entitled to a salary until she resumes duties.

Application is allowed. No costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
