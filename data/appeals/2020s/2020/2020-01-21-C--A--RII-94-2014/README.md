Decided on: 20.01.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The 1st Defendant-Petitioner Company (Petitioner) filed the petition dated 24.03.2014 seeking

inter alia to set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Balapitiya dated

28.10.2009 in D.C. Balapitiya Case No. P/3091 and the Order of the learned High Court Judges of

the High Court of Civil Appellate of the Southern Province holden in Galle dated 30.05.2012 in

SP /HCCA/GA/RA/29/2011.

The Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent (Respondent) filed his Statement of Objections on

29.09.2014 taking up several preliminary objections and prayed for the dismissal of the

application of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner filed its counter objections on 07.05.2015.

Facts of the Case

The Original Plaintiff instituted an action in the District Court of Balapitiya Case No. P/3091 and

sought to partition the land called "Galpottewatta" situated at Randombe containing in extent

A.1-R.2-P.0 morefully described in paragraph 2 of the Amended Plaint dated 02.03.1999.

On 15.06.2007, the Substituted Plaintiff was allowed to produce a consolidated pedigree. The

consolidated pedigree was filed on 30.10.2007.

The trial was held inter partes and the Substituted Plaintiff gave evidence. However, she was not

cross-examined by any of the Defendants. All the Defendants accepted the evidence given by the

Substituted Plaintiff and none of the documents marked by her were objected to. The Judgement

was delivered on 28.10.2009.

The application made by the Substituted Plaintiff to correct the clerical and arithmetical mistakes

contained in the said Judgment was rejected twice by the District Court of Balapitiya. Upon the

revision application preferred by the Substituted Plaintiff, the learned High Court Judges of the

High Court of Civil Appellate of the Southern Province holden in Galle amended and/or modified

the shares allotted to the parties by the said judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Balapitiya and an interlocutory decree was entered in conformity with the said amendment.

Undue Delay and/or Laches of the Petitioner

One of the preliminary objections taken up by the Respondent is that the Petitioner has invoked

the jurisdiction of this Court by way of restitutio in integrum after 411 years from the Judgment

of the learned Additional District Judge and 2 years after the Order of the learned High Court

Judges. As pointed out by the Respondent, the Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge

was pronounced on 28.10.2009 whereas the petition of the Petitioner was filed on 24.03.2014.

Also, the Order of the learned High Court Judges was delivered on 30.05.2012.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution has vested this Court with sole and exclusive jurisdiction to grant

relief by way of restitutio in integrum. This remedy cannot, unlike an appeal, be claimed by a

party as of right [Sri Lanka Insurance Carporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another (1995) 1 Sri.L.R.

55J. Therefore, the power to grant relief by way of restitutio in integrum is a matter of grace and

discretion [Usoofv. Nadarajah Chettiar (61 N.L.R. 173)J. A party seeking restitution must act with

the utmost promptitude [Babun Appu v. Simon Appu et al (11 N.L.R. 44), Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera et al (52 N.L.R. 409), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another

(supra)J. The Court will not relieve parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence or

laches [Sri Lanka Insuronce Corporotion Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another (supra)J.

The Petitioner has neither in its petition nor in its counter objections explained the reasons for

the undue delay and/or laches in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court by way of restitutio in

integrum.

Availability of an Alternative Remedy

Section 5C (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 reads-

"An oppeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or order

pronounced or entered by a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in

the exercise of its jurisdiction granted by Section 5A of this Act, with leave of the Supreme

Court first had and obtained. The leave requested for shall be granted by the Supreme

Court, where in its opinion the matter involves a substantial question of law or is a matter

fit for review by such Court. "

The judgement ofthe learned Additional District Judge has been amended/modified by the Order

of the learned High Court Judges of the High Court of Civil Appellate of the Southern Province

holden in Galle dated 30.05.2012 in SP/HCCA/GA/RA/29/2011. Ifthe Petitioner was aggrieved by

the said Order, it was open to the Petitioner to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme

Court.

Restitutio in integrum is more in the nature of an overriding (equitable) jurisdiction that may be

invoked at the discretion of the Court. If there is some other adequate remedy is available, the

remedy restitutio in integrum will not lie [Perera et 01 v. Wijewickreme et 01 (15 N.L.R. 411),

Menchinahamy v. Muniweera et 01 (supra), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shonmugam

and Another (supra)].

As I observed earlier, if aggrieved by the Order of the learned High Court Judges, it was open for

the Petitioner to seek relief in the Supreme Court which was not done.

Exceptional Circumstances

The remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary remedy and is given only under

very exceptional circumstances and the power of the Court should be most cautiously and

sparingly exercised [Perera et 01 v. Wijewickreme (supra), Menchinahamy v. Muniweero et 01

(supra), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugom and Another (supra)].

In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another (supra), Ranaraja, J. observed

(at page 62) -

"Fraud is defined by Labeo as any craft, deceit or contrivance employed with a view to

circumvent, deceive or ensnare another person. (Lee - Introduction to Roman Dutch Low

5th Ed. p225). Learned President's Counsel endeavoured to convince this Court that the

Respondents had deceived the Original Court into giving an ex parte judgment on the

suppression of evidence and misrepresentations referred to. Clearly, the grounds relied on

by the Petitioner to prove fraud do not fall within Labeo's definition of fraud.

The principle on which this Court has to act is not whether the Court that gave judgment

was tricked into it, but whether one party to action was deceived by the conduct of the

opposing party. Clearly it was not the case in this instance. It was entirely due to the lock

of due diligence on the port of the Petitioner that it took no steps to file the Answer.

Thereafter, it failed to file the necessary papers within the stipulated period to have the

decree set aside. Had the Petitioner filed its answer at the proper time, it could have taken

up all the defenses which it claims would have deprived the Respondents of the Judgment

obtained in their favour. Thus, it cannot now complain of a denial of justice. It has failed

to avail itself of the opportunity offered to present its case, not once but twice. When the

Court or the provisions of any law requires a party to adhere to specific mandatory time

limits, they should be complied with if due administration of justice is to be ensured. Those

who choose to ignore the time limits imposed, do so at their peril. They cannot be heard

to comploin of injustice loter. The remedy of restitutio in integrum is not available to a

party that has been guilty of a blatant lack of due diligence." [Emphasis added]

During the trial before the learned Additional District Judge, not only an authorized agent of the

Petitioner was present but the Petitioner was also represented by a Counsel. However, the

Petitioner did not object to and dispute any of the evidence, oral or documentary, led by the

Substituted Plaintiff (i. e. the Respondent). Neither did the Petitioner cross-examine her during

the trial even though the opportunity was given.

Where a party by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings,

the Court will not exercise its discretion to set aside the impugned proceedings. For it is not the

function of the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the

consequences oftheir own folly, negligence or laches [Don Lewis v. Dissanayake (70 N.L.R. 8)).

As I observed earlier, the Petitioner was represented by a Counsel throughout the entire process.

The Petitioner consented to the consolidated pedigree and didn't dispute the evidence led by the

Substituted Plaintiff. Ifthe conduct ofthe Substituted Plaintiff was contrary to law and fraudulent,

the Petitioner had ample opportunity to bring it to the notice of the Court. However, it was not

done. Therefore, I hold that that the Petitioner acquiesced in or approbated the alleged defective

proceedings. Hence there are no exceptional circumstances.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of

this Court by way of restitutio in integrum.

The preliminary objections enumerated above are upheld and the application of the Petitioner is

dismissed in limine with costs.
