III This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned High COUIt

Judge of Kalutara dated 08.10.20 I a dismissing the revision application

filed by the 2"" Palty-Responent-Petitioner-Appellant to have the order

of the learned Primary Court Judge of kalut;u-a dated 17.12.2009 set

aside in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction under Article I54P

(a) (b) of the Constitution.

121 The Ollicer in Charge of Aluthg,Ulla Police Station filed an

information in the Mal,ristrate's Court of Kalutara 04.02.2009 under

the provisions of Section 66 (I) (a) of the Primary Courts' Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979 to the eflect that there is a dispute over a roadway

between the I" Party-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent and the 2''''

Party-Responent-Petitioner-Appellant, and that his efforts to eflect a

peaceful settlement failed and til at due to this dispute, a serious breach

of the peace is threatened or is likely to occur.

Affidavits of the Parties

lal The I" Party-Respondent-Respondcnt-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) filed his atlidavit and claimed, inter aiia,

that he is the owner of a land called "Mahagederawatta alias Ellupitiya"

depicted as lot I in plan no. 4160 made by W. Seneviratne, Licensed

Surveyor and the 2"" Party-Responent-Petitioncr-Appellant (hereinafter

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

/

,-.- i: ' referred to as the Appellant) is the owner of lot 2 depicted in the same

plan. He claimed that the right of way called "Bakinigahawatta" which

is depicted as lot 4 in plan no. 4160 marked P3 is leading to his land

from the hospital road and that he has been using the said right of way

for over a period of 100 years without any disruption. He further stated

that the said right of way is also shown as "PATH" in plan no. 2720

made by U.M.de Silva, licensed Surveyor for the purpose of the

partition case bearing no. P/489 (P5 and P6). The Respondent alleged

that the said right of way which is the only means of access to his land

was blocked by the Appellant by erecting a foundation and a gate

across the said right of way and sought an order for the removal of the

said obstructions.

14J The Appellant filed his affidavit and while admitting that his land is

lot 2 depicted in plan no. 4160 marked 2P4/P3, claimed that the

disputed roadway is a private road and the Respondent never used any

right of way as a means of access to his land. He further claimed that

the Respondent was a defendant to the partition case bearing no.

P/7402 which was filed to partition the southern portion of the

Respondent's land called "Mahagederawatta" depicted in plan no. 386

made by U.M.de Silva, licensed Surveyor. He stated in the affidavit

that the defendants in the said partition case claimed that they were

using a road from the northern and western side of their land as a

means of access to their land and sought the pennission of the court to

obtain water and electricity connection to their property along the said

road which is more fully depicted in plan no. 386.

151 The Third-Intervenient-Respondent and the fourth-Intervenient-

Respondent were added a~ intervenient Respondents and they filed

PHC 0167-13 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. CHlLA W 15967166

their respective aflidavits 111 support of the position taken by the

Appellant.

Order of the Primary Court

161 After the filing of allidavits, counter alTidavits, marked documents

and written submissions, the learned Mal,ristrate hy order dated

17.12.2009 identified the suhject matter of the action as a right of way

dispute, which is depicted as lot 4 in plan No. 4160 made hy W.

Seneviratne, Licensed Surveyor. Alter having evaluated the allidaviL'i,

documents and written submissions, the learned Magistrate held Lhat

the Respondent is entitled to use said right of way as a me,ms of access

to his land depicted as lot 4 in plan no. 4160 from the Hospital Road

and the Appellant h,ld obstructed the said right of way.

171 Accordingly, the learned Magistrate directed the Appellant to

remove all obstructions and not to interlere with the exercise of the

said right of the I" Party Respondent other than under the authority of

an order or decree of a competent court.

Revision Application to the Provincial High Court

181 Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate of

Kalutara, the Appellant made an application in revision to the

Provincial High Court of Kalutara and after inquiry, the learned High

Court Judge by his judgment dated 10.08.2013 allirmed the order of

the learned Ma!,ristTate of Kalutara and dismissed the revision

application.

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

191 Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned High COUlt

Judge of Kalutara dated 10.08.2013, the Appellant has pretelTed this

Appeal to this COUlt.

Grounds of Appeals

1101 At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the

Appellant sought to challenge the judgment of the learned High COUlt

Judge on dle following !,'Tounds:

I. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the

learned Magistrate has erred in holding dlat the Respondent has

and his predecessors had used the disputed right of way for more

than 100 years when the Respondent has failed to establish his

entidement to the disputed right of way in terms of section 69 of the

Primary Courts' Procedure Act;

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that dle

learned Magistrate has erred in not considering the fact dlat the

disputed right of way is a private right of way to dle Appellant's land;

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that dle

learned Magistrate has erred in not considering the filct that the

Respondent has an alternative me,UlS of access to his property as

shown in pl,Ul no. 386 made by M.M.de Silva, Licensed Surveyor;

4. The learned High COUlt Judge has erred in holding that the

Appellant has failed to establish exceptional circumstances which

WiUTdnt dle intelvention of the High Court.

Identity of the subject matter of the action

1II1 It is not in dispute that the subject matter of dle dispute relates to a

right of way called "Bakinigahawatta Road" which is depicted as lot 4 in

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

'.

pl;m no. 4160 made by W. Seneviratlle, Licensed Surveyor, dated

19.06.1985, for the purpose of partition action bearing no. 4849/P in the

District COUlt of Kalutara marked pa. The bU"lled Ma6ristrate has clearly

identilied the subject matter of the dispute in his order and held that the

disputed right 0[" way is depicted ilS lot 4 in Plan No. 4160 made by W.

Seneviratne, Licensed Surveyor, dated 19.06.1985, lor the purpose of

partition action be,lring no. 4849/P in the District Court of Kalutara

marked pa. The suqject matter of the dispute is, thus, in reg-arc! to a right

of way which lalls within the ambit of section 69 of the Primary Courts'

Procedure Act.

Scope of the Inquiry under Section 69 of the Primary Courts' Procedure

Act

1121 Belore I proceed to discuss the main points urged by the Counsel for

the Appellant, it is important to identify the scope of the inquiry under

section 69 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. Section 69 of the said

Act relates to the determination of any right to any land or palt thereof,

other than the right to possession of such land or (J,ut thereof under

section G8 of the Act.

II al The important question that arises lor determination is the nature of

the right to be established by a party who claims a right of way to any land

other than the right to possession in obtaining a decl;u-ation as

contemplated in section G9 of the Act. Section 69(1) reads as follows:

U(/) \lJl7lere dIe di\fJute relates to allY light to any liLl7d or a.ny Pillt of" a lan{/, adler dJan dIe light to possession of" such land or Pillt

thereat; the./lldge of"dle PniwlIY Court sha.ll detenmiJe as to who il entitled to dIe light which i, die sul.lject of"dJe di~pute iLl7d make all order under subsection (2);

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

(2) An order under this subsection may declare d1<lt any person specdied therelil shall be enfJded to any such light Ii) or respecfJng dle land or lil any palt oFthe leU7d as may be spe(1lied lil dIe order unfJ? such person is deplived oFsucll nght by vritue oran order or decree of a competent COUlt, and prolnbit all disturbance or lilterierence JJdl dle exercise oFsuch nght by such p;uty other d1<ln

under dle aud70niy of an order or deaee as aloresaid '~

1141 In an inquiry into a dispute as to a right of way to any land, where a

breach of peace is threatened or is likely under Part VII of the Primary

Courts' Procedure Act, the main point for decision is who is entitled to the

right of way which is tile subject of dispute between the parties. In

RamallilgaIn J~ 77lang;u~jah 1982 (2) Sri LR 693, Sharvananda, J (as he

then was) interpreted the above provision as regards the nature of tile right,

a Judge of tile Primary Court is expected to determine under section 69.

Sharvananda,j. at page 699 stated:

"017 the odler hand, IF dle dispute is IiI Ir:g-dlyl to any nght to any land, odler dlilll nght of possession of such 1;U7d, dle quesfJon for deciSIon, accoll!Jilg to secfJon 69(1), i5 who is enfJded to dIe nght

which i5 sul?ject of dispute. The WOld "enfJde" heIr: connotes the ownersluiJ of dle nght. The COUlt has to detenmile which of the pillties has acqUlir:d that right or is entitled for the time being to exercise that right In contradicfJon to secfJon 68, secfJon 69 reqUlir:s the COUlt to detenmile dIe quesfJon which party i5 enfJded to dle disputed nght prehimiwy to maiuilg iIIl order under secfJon (2) '~

1151 Salam, j. in referring to the decision in Riunallilgam v. Th;U7g;ll~iah

(supra) held in Ananda Sill-adl PilldJlr1/:,FaJTJa v. Dhammadhamma Sill-adl

PilldJlag;llna and odlers 2011 (I) Sri LR 284 that the two ways in which an

entitlement to enjoy a right under section 69 can be proved in tile Primary

Court are:

I. by adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a civil court;

PHC 167-20 13 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 Me. KALUTARA 04/09

-.

2. by offering proof that he is entitled to the right FOR THE TIME

BEING.

1161 In determining whetller a person is to be declared entitled to a right

under section 69(2), tlle Judge of the Primary Court is obliged to consider

first, as to which party has acquired the disputed right of way by offering

proof of his entitlement as done in a civil action until he is deprived of such

right by virtue of an order or decree of a competent court. Even if there is

no proof of his entitlement to any acquisition of a right of way as done in a

civil action, the Judge of the primary Court is also obliged to consider

whether, he had ollered any proof that he is entitled to exercise such right

for the time being until he is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or

decree of a competent court.

1171 Thc nature of the dispute allecting tlle right of way to any land in

section 69 relates only to a dispute IiI the Ilature of'a selvltude as defined in

section 75 of the Act. Section 75 of tlle primalY Courts Procedure Act

reads as follows:

"Ill du!; PiUt "(h~pute iuJ(xuilg liUJd" lile/udes allY dispute as to dIe nght to dIe possessioll of'any liUJd or part of'a land and dIe bUJJdlilg~' dlereon or dIe boundanes dlereof'or as to dIe light to culu'vate iUJY lalld or paIt of'a land or as to die crops or produce Or;U1Y land, or Pillt of'a land or as to iUJY light in the nah.Jre of a seIvitude a1kcting

the land and any ref'erellce to "liUJd" Iii du!; Part lile/udes a reference to any blllkhilg staJ}{hilg dlereon ':

1181 The right intended to be declared under section 69 is definitely not

with regard to servitude per se, bula right in the nature of a servitude and

thus, tlle period of 10 years plays no important role as it is not a dispute

touching upon a servitude relating to a right of way like in a civil action

(Allanda Saradl P;urllia/fama v. Dh;u11madh;lI11J))a Saradl P;urUJag;ll11a alld

odlers (supra).

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC, KALUTARA 04/09

1191 The procedure of an inquiry under Part VI I of the Act is sui genens

and thus, the procedure to be adopted and the manner in which the

proceedings are to be conducted are clearly set out in sections 66, 71 and

72 of the Act (RiunahiJg;wl v. 77Jiwgarajah (supra). Section 72 prescribes

the material on which the determination under section 68 and 69 of the

Act is to be based and such determination under Palt VII shall be made

after eXalnination and consideration of-

(a) The information filed and the aflidavits and documents furnished;

(b) Such other evidence on ally matter ai-ising on the aflidavits or

documents furnished as the COUlt may permit to be led on that

matter; and

(c) Such oral or written submissions as may be permitted by the.ludge of

the Primal")' Court in his discretion.

1201 A wide discretion has been given to the Primal"}' Court judge under

section 72 of the Act to decide on the type of evidence and material on

which he should act in making his determination under section 68 or 69 of

the Act. As Shal"Vallallda, J. obsel"Ved in Ramaililg;un I~ 771anganyaJJ

(supra) at page 701, "The determination should, in the main, be founded

on the "information filed and the aHidavits and documents furnished by

the parties". Adducing evidence by way of aHadavits alld documents is the

IUle and oral testimony is an exception to be permitted only at the

discretion of the.l udge. That discretion should be exercised judicially, only

in a fit case and not as a matter of course alld not be surrendered to pal-ties

or their counsel".

1211 While the rule is that the determination should be founded 011 the

information filed and the aflidavits and documents furnished by the parties,

oral testimony is an exception to be permitted only at the discretion of the

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

' .

judge and such discretion should be exercised judicially only in a lit case

and not as a matter of course (R;unahilg;un I: 17NU1/jdJ<!iah at p. 701).

When possession or dispossession by any of the IMrties at the relevant time

is disputed, then the Court may permit oral evidence of the parties to be

led <U1d the wilJlesses should be directed to that question only, namely, for

the purpose of ascertaining the true position wiul0ut however, converting

the inquiry into a full scale trial or civil issues, as in a civil case (supra).

Entitlement of fue Respondent to the disputed right of way

1221 It is not disputed ulat the Respondent is residing in lot 1 depicted in

plan no. 4160 and the Appellant is residing in lot 2 depicted in the same

plan. Lot 4 depicted in the said plan is the disputed right or way which is

situated on the northern boundary of the Appellant's land and it is shown

as a means or access rrom the Centre Road as depicted in plan no. 4160

marked P3. It is also not in dispute that the disputed right of way is shown

as the "PATH" in pliU1 no. 2720 marked P5 made by M. P. de Silva

Licensed Surveypr dated 25.01.1983 and the said "PATH" is lot "A"

depicted in the said plan no. 2720 marked p,).

1231 At the he;u-ing the learned Counsel lor the Appellant heavily relied on

the Respondent's deed bearing no. 1790 dated 01.10.1997 marked PI and

plan no. 4160 marked P3/2P4 and submitted that the Respondent has

failed to establish that he had a right to use the disputed right of way. He

submitted that the Respondent has railed to prove ;U1Y existence of a right

or way in his deed bearing No. 1790 dated 01.1 0.1997 attested by YS.de

Silva, Notary Public (PI) as it does not refer to any right of way on Ule

nortl1ern boundary or his lot "I A2" depicted in plan no. 8926 dated

07.10.1995.

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62109 Me. KALUTARA 04109

1241 According to the said deed bearing no. 1790 dated 01.10. 1997

marked PI, the vendors of the said deed are Mohamed Marikkar

Fathhuma Haneeda, Aboobucker Lebbe Ahamed Bawa Mohamed

Munawwa Ali, Aboobucker Lebbe Ahamed Bawa Packeer Zamsil Luha,

Aboobucker Lebbe Ahamed Hawa Packeer Yasmin. The vendees are

Aboobucker Lebbe Alla1TIed Hawa MohalTIed AslaJTI (Respondent) and his

brother Aboobucker Lebbe AhalTIed Hawa Mohamed Iynas. The said

deed describes the relevant part of the schedule as follows:

"All dJat right and interest into and upon all dlat diVided and defined allotment of' land called lot IA2 of MahagederawatlLl alias Elupittiyawatta as depicted lil Plan No. 8076 dated 07. 10.1.9.95 and made hy W SenellliCltm; Licel1.5ed SUIveyO/; ....... hounded on dJe North by I1/ayawatta, East by Iraklwmara-KkalayawatlLl and Pelawatta JVherelil Kabhe Lebbe Miuikkar resided, SoudJ by Lot 1 C and Lot IE of'dJe same land, and on dle West by Lot lAl of'the same land and contaJillilg In extent Thirty 77m~e Perches (A-O R 0 P- 33)."

1251 The learned Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that plan no.

4160 shows that the northern boundal1' of lot I is demarcated by a "wire

fence" and thus, the access to Lot lover Lot 4 of the said plall is not

shown on the face of the said plan. A perusal of the plan no. 4160 dated

19.06.1985 however, reveals that it was a preliminaJ)' plall prepared for the

DislTict COUIt of Kalutal-a paltition ca~e bearing no. P/4849 and the

disputed road ends at the entrace to lot 1, which IS the land of the

Respondent as depicted in dle said plan no. 4160.

1261 Although the learned Counsel for dle Appellant submitted that the

boundaJ1' of lot I is demarcated by a "wire fence", dle Surveyor Mr.

Senevirable who prepal-ed dle said plan no. 4160 on 19.06.1985 has clearly

staled ill his Report marked P4 that dle means of access to lot 1 is along lot

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 Me. KALUTARA 04/09

.-

4 over lot 2 at its North Western point Item No.1 0 of his Report at page

184 of the brief reads as follows:

"} O-}.;xi5I.Iilg mea.ns at access to dIe land linm I.he ne;u"Cst Public Road: Cenl.!"C Road linm I.he Eastem boundaJY ot2 and 3 Iii my plaJl. The access to lot 1 is Lot 4 and over Lot 2 at its North Westem point".

1271 A perusal of the oldest Plan No. 2720 dated 25.01.1983 marked 1'5

prepared for the D.C. Kalutara Case No. 4819 by ll.M. de Silva, Licensed

Surveyor lurther reveals that lot "B" in extent of 1 rood and 1 6 perches is

the identical lot 2 depicted in plan no. 4160 marked 1'3. Lot "A" depicted

in plan no. 2720 is the "PATH" which goes along the northern boundary

of lot "B" depicted in plan no. 2720. The said "PATH" is the identical lot

4 in extent of 3.62 depicted in plan no. 41 GO marked 1'3. It seems to me

that there is no indication whatsoever, in plan no. 2720 that the northern

boundary of lot "13" in plan no. 2720 is demarcated by a "wire lence" as

claimed by the Appellant. It is to be noted that both Surveyors had not

indicated in their reports that lot 4 depicted in plan no. 4160 or "PATH"

depicted in plan no. 2720 is the means of access to the Appellant's land.

1281 On the other hand, the said two plans and Ule said two reports cle;u'ly

confirm ule position of the Respondent that the disputed right of way had

been in existence on the ground when boul Surveyors made uleir plans in

1983 and 1985 and that Ule said right of way is the only means of access to

lot 1 depicted in plan no. 4160 marked 1'3. .

1291 Moveover, Ule Grama Sevaka Niladhari, Beruwela in his Report

marked P22 has clearly confirmed that (i) the disputed right of way existed

when he assumed his duties in 199:-3, as a menas of access to the Railway

Stattion from ule Hospital Road which is also Ule Centre Road referred to

by the Police Ollicer in his Report at page 109 of Ule brief and Surveyor

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

U.M.de Silva in his plan no. 2720 marked P5; (ii) the said right of way

existed over the land called "Mahagederawatta alias Ellupitiyawatta" of

which the Respondent is constructing a house; (iii) the entire land called

"Mahagederawatta alias Ellupitiyawatta" was blocked out and the southem

and westem boundaries of the said hilld was connected to

"Bathalagahawatta Road" blocking the disputed right of way: (iv) the

Respondent's land was blocked out adjoining and connecting to the

disputed right of way called "Bakinigahawatta Road"; (v) the Appellant and

his sibling had blocked the entrace to the disputed right of way by erecting

a foundation and two g-dtes. His observations at page 204 and 205 of the

1301 According to the letter issued by the Member of the Beruwela

Pradeshiya Sabawa who was also the Chairman of the Aluthg-dlla Town

Council marked P 19, he had used the disputed "Bakinil,raha Road" as an

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

access road to reach lands situated on the northern side of the Hospital

Road !iom 1960. In addition, the letters marked P20 and 1'21 issued by

the Secreta I}' of the Beruwela Pradeshiya Sabawa confirm that upon an

inspection being made by the Council, it had been revealed that the

Appellant had blocked the disputed road which is used as private a right of

way by erected a gate at the entrance to the appellant's l'U1d.

I:~ II UpOII a consideration of the above-mentioned material, it is CI},stal

clear that the Respondent has produced material before the Magistrate's

Court and proved that the disputed right of way had been in existence 011

the ground for a long period of time as a me,U1S of access to lot I depicted

in Plan No. 41 GO and Respondent and his predecessors-ill-title had been

using the disputed right of way for a long period of time as correctly

decided by the learned Ma/,,'istrate in his order.

Relevancy of the disputed right of way as a private road

1321 The learned Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that the

disputed road is a private road to the Appellant's land and tllUS, tile 1"

Respondent Gumot claim a right of way over his private lane\. The

Appellant relied on the second letter issued by the SecretaJ}' of tlle

Beruwela Pradeshiya Sabawa marked 1'20 to establish tIlat tile disputed

right of way is a private road and thus, tlle Respondent is not entitled to

claim the disputed right of way.

13:11 The letter l11<uked 1'20 only states that upon a site inspection, it was

revealed that the right of way that had been blocked is a private road. The

letter issued by the same SecretaJy of the Beruwela Pradeshiya Sabawa

marked P21 states that upon a site inspection, it was f(lUnd that the

Appellant had blocked the disputed right of way and thus, the Pradeshiya

Sabawa had directed tile Appellant not not block tile right of way.

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 Me. KALUTARA 04/09

1341 The letter relied on by the Appellant marked P20 does not support

the Appellant's case whatsoever, as it only confinns that the disputed right

of way is not a common road owned by the Pradeshiya Sabawa but a

private road. The Appellant has not, however, produced a single

document to contradict the entires made in Survey plan no. 4160 or plan

no. 2760 and establish that the disputed righl of way is being exclusively

used by him as a right of way or that such entries in the Surveyors' Reports

are erroneous.

1351 As noted, plan no. 4160 ,md plan no. 2720 do not indicate that the

disputed right of way is the means of access to the Appellant's lot 2

depicted in pl;Ul no. 4160 or his lot B depicted in pl;Ul no. 2720. On the

other hand, the repOit at page 184 clearly indicates that access to lot I is

along lot 4 over lot 2 at its north western point For those reasons, the

learned Magistrate has correctly held tllat the letter marked P20 does not

establish the fact that the disputed right of way is being exclusively used by

the Appellant.

Existence of an alternative roadway

1361 The le;uned Counsel for tile Appellant further relied on tile contents

of the petition filed by the defend;ult~, including the Respondent in tile

District Court of Kalut;u-a case be;u-ing no. P/7402 ,md the Plan No. 386

marked "E" to establish that tllere exists a rq,rul;u- road as a means of

access to the Respondent's land as they had claimed utilities to their

property along the "Bathalawatta Road" which is situated on tile Southern

portion of "Elluvapitiya". The le;u-ned Counsel for the Appell;ult brought

to our attention p;u-agraphs I, 2 and 4 or the said Petition, which read as

follows:

la71 The Appellant has, however, admitted in his (irst atlidavit dated

18.0a.2009 that the assessment number or the Respondent's house is

97/08 and 4 of his siblings arc residing in houses bearing assessment

numbers 97/05, 97/06 and 97/07. A perusal or the Police Sketch at page

109 of the brief, the sketch prepared by the Grama Sevaka N iladhari at

page 205 of the brief and the Apepllant's own sketch marked 2P 1 and 2P 1

at pages 42 ,md 20S of the brief clearly reveal that while the Respondent's

house is situated facing the disputed road, his siblings' houses are situated

behind his land and racing the "Bathalawatta Road".

laSI The RepOit or the Grama Sevaka Niladhari marked P22 clearly

confirms that when the larger land called "Mahagederawatta" was blocked

out, the Respondent's land was blocked out adjoining and connecting to

the "Bakinig'dhawatta Road" and the Appellant had blocked the right or

way at the entrance to the Respondent's land. I nder such circumstances,

the learned Ma!,risLrate has correctly decided that the Respondent cannot

be deprived of his right of way ror the mere reason that he had obtained

water and electricity connection along the "Bathalawatta Road".

PHC 167-2013 HC. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 MC. KALUTARA 04/09

1391 As noted, when a party is seeking relief under section 69 of the

Primary COUl1s' Procedure Act, it is not necessary to establish his right in a

manner as required in a District Court case. All what the Court has to

determine is whether a party had acquired a right of way or whether he is

entitled, for the time being, to exercise a right of way in tlle nature of

servitude until such party is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or

decree of a competent COUIt.

1401 Section 74 of tlle Act provides that an order made under section 68 or

69 of the Act "shall not prejudice any right or interest in any land or palt of

a land which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit. Thus, it is

clear that the order to be made by tlle Primary CourtJudge under section

69 of the Act is a temporary one and tlle objective is to prevent a breach of

peace until such time a court of competent jurisdiction resolves the dispute

on a pennanent basis.

1411 The Respondent has adduced suflicient material to establish the

existence of the disputed right of way for a long period of time and that he

and his predecessors had been using the said right of way depicted as lot 4

in plan no. 4160 marked P3 as a means of access to his land and thus, he is

entitled, for the time being to exercise tllat right until a court of competent

jurisdiction resolves the dispute on a permanent basis.

1421 When tlle Respondent has established that he is entitled to use the

disputed right of way which is the subject of the dispute, he shall be

declared entitled to the said right of way as correctly decided by the learned

Magistrate. The Respondent has further established tllat the Appellant had

blocked the disputed right of way by erecting a foundation and two gates

across the right of way and thus, tlle Judge of the Primary Court is obliged

to prohibit all distrurbance or interference with the exercise of such right

and remove all such disturbance as required by section 69(2) of tlle Act.

Exceptional Circumstances

14:11 The linal submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant was

that was that the learned High CourtJudge was wrong in holding that the

Appellant has failed to adduce any evidence as to the existence of any

exceptional circumstances which warrant the intervention of Court by way

of revision.

I ,til. I The Appellant sought to exerCISe the revisionalY jurisdiction of the

High Court to have the order of the learned Ma/,';strate set aside. It is true

that in the present case, no appeal lies against the order of the learned

Ma/,';strate made under section 69 of the PrimalY Courts Procedure Act

and thus, his only remedy is to come by way of a revision. It is trite law that

the purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is supervisOIY in nature and that the

o~ject is the proper administration of justice (Atlvmey-General v.

Gunawardena (1996) 2 Sri LR 149, at p. 156). In M;uian Beebee v. Seyed

Mohamed 58 NLR 36, Sansoni C..! has clearly stated the reasons for the

exercise of the extraordinary power of revisionaJY jurisdiction by Appellate

Courts as follows:

"771e power of revisioll is an extraordin;uy power which i5 quite lildependent of and disuilCl kom dIe appellate .iun!;dicu'on of d7l:5

relerring to the decisions in Atukorale v, S;unynadJall (1939) 41 N.L.R.

N.L.R. 549 and Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79 (2) Sri LR 225) stated at

PHC 167-2013 He. KALUTARA HCRA-62/09 Me. KALUTARA 04/09

page 34 that "it is well established that the powers of revision conferred on

this Court are very wide and the Court has the discretion to exercise them

whedler an appeal lies or not or whether an appeal where it lies has been

taken or not. But this discretionary remedy can be invoked only where

dlere are exceptional circumstances warranting the intervention of the

COUlt."

1461 011 appeal to the Supreme Court, vVanasundera,.). while allirming the

"iews expressed by So;r.a,.). stated in Rasheed A. Ii 1'. j\,fohamed Ali (I 98 I)

1 Sri 1,R 2G2 (SC) at page 265:

"1l1e pOlfleJ:l" oFrel,isioll vested IiI Ii)e COUIt o/Appeal are I'e!]' H1de ;l1Jd lile CUUlt call IiI a fil case exercise lila! puwer Hdleli](~r ur nut all appeal lies.

1471 On dle other h,U1d, there are other instances, where the Courts have

held that the Appellate Court has power in re\ision to set aside an

erroneous decision or the District Court. In Ran:Jslilghe ~; Hellll)' (I 8%) 1

N LR 30:-3, it was held that where order of the trial COUlt is wrong ex fiIcie,

it will be quashed by way of revision even dlOugh no appeal may lie against

such order. In SlimalilaJlg'dJn v. Meeramolwdeen 60 NLR 393,

KusumalflatiJJt: Pigera and Otilers (CA (PHC) APN G9/2009 decided on

23.07.2013, Salam,.J. held at pages 5-6 that

"It does not mean ti1<lt tile Petitioner who invokes tile revisionillY powel:>' of tile COUlt should in his petition state IiI so milny words tilat

1491 Where the order of the Primary Court Judge is shown to be ex hlClt:

erroneous, it would constitute an exceptional circumstance warr<Ulting the

intervention of the High Court and thus, the High Court is bound to revise

such erroneous order, as the order was allowed to operate, would cause a

misGuTiage of justice.

1501 The learned High Court./udge in my view has analysed the order of

the learned Magistrate to find out whether the circumstances enumerated

in the petition by the Appellant in the High Court constitute exceptional

circumstances. As noted, the Appellant has failed to satisfy that the order

of the learned Magistrate is erroneous and thus, learned High CourtJudge

was correct in holding that upon tlle consideration of tlle material placed

before him, the le<U'ned Magistrate has correctly held tIlat tile Respondent

was entitled to use the right of way depicted as lot 4 in Plan No. 4160.

1511 II nder such circumstances, the learned High CourtJ udge has correctly

held tIlat the order of the learned Magistrate is not erroneous and tllUS, tile

circumstances enumerated in the Petition filed by the Appellant in the

High Court did not constitue exeptional circumstances warranting the

intervention of tile High Court in the exercise of its revisionary powers.

Conclusion

1521 In my view, the learned Magistrate and the learned High COUltJudge

are justified in their conclusions and thus, I do not see merit in any of the

grounds urged by the learned Counsel for the Appellant to interfere with

the decision of the learned Magistrate of Kalutara or the learned High

CourtJudge of Kalutara.

1531 I accordingly, aflinTI the order of the learned Magistrate of Kalutara

dated 17.12.2009 and the jud!,'lTIent of the learned High COUltJudge of
