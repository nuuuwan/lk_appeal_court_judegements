Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 26th August 2020, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners and the learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents

moved that judgment in this matter be delivered on the written submissions that had

already been tendered by the parties.

The 1st 3rd, 5th and 7th 10th Petitioners had joined the Police Department as Police

Constables at different periods of time between 1988 2008, while the 4th and 6th

Petitioners had joined as Sub Inspectors of Police in 1990 and 1996, respectively.

While the 1st 5th Petitioners claim that they sustained injuries whilst performing law

enforcement measures, the 6th 10th Petitioners claim that they have sustained

injuries whilst performing operational duties or due to terrorist attacks. All

Petitioners state that they are permanently disabled as a result of the said injuries.

It is admitted by the parties that the Cabinet of Ministers took the following decision,

marked P4, in July 1982:

The Cabinet considered a note to the Cabinet on Special Provision for Officers

of the Armed Services and the Police who have been killed or who have been

permanently disabled as a result of terrorist activity whilst performing law

enforcement duties by the President and Minister of Defence since numbered

as Cabinet Paper No. 305 of 1982 (Continuation 9), and approval was granted:

(a) for the next of kin of these personnel of the Armed Services and the Police

who are killed whilst performing operational duties or as a result of

terrorist activity or other law enforcement measures to be paid the full

salary and allowances of the deceased officers which were paid to him on

the date of his death till such time as he would have reached 55 years of

age if he was alive;

(b) for any officer of the Armed Services or Police who is disabled and has to

leave the services as a result of such injuries received whilst performing

operational duties or by terrorist activity or other law enforcement

measures to be paid the full salary and allowances he was drawing at the

time he received such injuries till he reached the age of 55years.

5

(c) For any increases in pay allowances that would accrue to such officers

from time to time if they were alive and in service to be also paid to those

in categories (a) and (b) above;

(d) For the date of implementation of this decision to be retrospective from

22.7.1977, and the payment under this scheme to commence from the

date of the decision of the Cabinet; and

(e) For any special case which deserve consideration and as defined above

which occurred prior to 22.7.1977 to be examined on an individual basis.

There is no dispute that the above Cabinet decision applies to all Officers in the

Police Department who have suffered permanent disability due to terrorist attacks or

while being engaged in law enforcement measures. This is confirmed by Circular No.

107/82 dated 19th August 1982, marked P5, issued by the 1st Respondent, the

Inspector General of Police.

The Petitioners state that after becoming permanently disabled, they were all paid

varying sums of money as compensation. While some of the Petitioners have been

paid their salaries from the time they became disabled, the salaries of the 1st 4th

Petitioners had been paid only from August 2009, although they suffered their

injuries leading to the disability in 1990, 1991, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The

Petitioners however admit that since 2012, they are being paid their salary.

The Petitioners state that in addition to the payment of their salaries, they are also

entitled in terms of P4 to the payment of allowances that are paid to those who are

currently in service. While some of the Petitioners have been or are being paid some

of the said allowances, the Petitioners complain that there has not been any

consistency in the payment of allowances. The Petitioners state that they made

representations to the 1st Respondent, and to the 2nd Respondent, the Secretary,

Ministry of Law and Order (under which Ministry the Police Department functioned

at the time this application was filed), seeking a resolution of the issue relating to the

payment of allowances. However, as no finality had been reached, the Petitioners

have filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

6

a) A Writ of Mandamus directing that the Petitioners be paid allowances in

accordance with the Cabinet decision marked P4;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing that the Petitioners be paid all their allowances

from the date that they were declared disabled.

Acting on representations made to the Ministry of Law and Order in 2015 by the 4th

Petitioner, an Additional Secretary of the said Ministry, by letter dated 30th October

2015 marked P5a, had requested the 1st Respondent to provide details of all

Officers who have suffered permanent disabilities and the steps hitherto taken by

the Police Department in terms of P4.

By letter dated 23rd December 2015 marked P6, the 1st Respondent had informed

the Secretary, Ministry of Law and Order as follows:

a) Public Administration Circular No. 21/88 has made provision to pay the salary

and all allowances to all Officers of the Police Department who have suffered

permanent disability as a result of terrorist activity, and who have been retired

on medical grounds, until they reach the age of 55.

b) Those who do not fall within (a) above, but who have become permanently

disabled as a result of suffering injuries while performing their official duties

and who are retired on medical grounds are entitled to the payment of their

salary until they reach the age of 55, together with compensation calculated at

ten years of their salary, in terms of Public Administration Circular No. 22/93.

c) The category of Officers in (b) above are however not entitled to the payment

of allowances in terms of the said Circular No. 22/93.

With regard to the Cabinet decision P4, the 1st Respondent had stated as follows in

P6:

The 1st Respondent had thereafter sought approval for the following:

In response to P6, the Ministry of Law and Order, by its letter dated 27th May 2016

marked P7 had granted the 1st Respondent the approval to proceed with the

request made in P6.1

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued Internal Circular No. 2582/16 on 13th July

2016 marked P7a, conveying the contents of P7 and calling for details of those

Officers who have suffered permanent disability while performing operational duties

or as a result of terrorist attacks. Similar instructions have been issued by Circular

marked P8.

The Police Department had thereafter issued RTM No. 461 on 14th November 2017,

marked R1 informing that any Officer who is suffering from a permanent disability

due to an injury sustained while being on duty maintaining law and order should be

paid his salary, and allowances referred to therein, until that Officer reaches the age

of 55, and that such payments shall commence from November 2017. R1 goes onto

state that instructions have been issued by the Ministry of Law and Order for the

payment of arrears as well, and that once financial allocations are obtained,

instructions with regard to payment of arrears would be issued.

1 P7 reads as follows: ta wkqj 1982.08.21 osk wud;H uKav, wkque;sh ,ens we;s 1982 wxl 305 orK wud;H uKav, m;%sldj wkqj kS;sh yd iduh wdrlaId lsrsfus rdPldrsfha fhos isgshos isoqjk wk;=re fya;=fjka tys m%;sM,hla jYfhka urKhg m;ajk fyda mQraK wdndO ;;a;ajhg m;ajk ks,Odrska i|yd Tjqka tu isoaOshg uqyqK fok wjia:dfjs ,nd.;a jegqma iy wfkl=;a osukd ish,a, jhi wjq' 55 jk f;la f.jSu i|yd ,nd os we;s wkque;sh mrsos ksl=;a lr we;s wxl 478$82 orK uQ,ia:dk pl%f,aLh mrsos lghq;= lsrSu iqoqiq nj okajus'

Thus, the clear instructions issued by the 1st Respondent, as well as the Ministry of

Law and Order, and the Police Department are that all Officers who have suffered

permanent disability while being engaged in maintaining law and order should be

paid their salary and allowances until they reach the age of 55 years. In other words,

the 1st and 2nd Respondents have agreed to apply P4 to all Police Officers who

satisfy the criteria specified in P4.

In his written submissions, the learned Senior State Counsel has submitted that while

the Respondents are making every endeavour to ensure the payment of all

allowances and arrears of allowances to those who have suffered permanent

disability by answering the call of duty, the 1st Respondent is unable to proceed any

further unless and until the necessary financial appropriation is made by the Cabinet

of Ministers. Thus, there is no denial by the Respondents that P4 does not apply to

Officers of the Police Department who have satisfied the criteria laid down therein.

I shall now consider if a Writ of Mandamus would lie in these circumstances.

In Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and others,2 the Supreme Court, having

considered the matters that must be satisfied by a party seeking a Writ of

Mandamus, held that:

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where

officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform, Mandamus

will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the performance of

which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only granted to compel the

performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely of private character

that is to say for the enforcement of a mere private right, stemming from a

contract of the parties.

In Rajeswari Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industries and

Commerce and Others3 Aluwihare, J held that, In an application for a writ of

2 [1982] 2 Sri LR 451. 3 SC Appeal No. 177/15; SC Minutes of 31st August 2018.

mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether or not the officer or authority in

question has in law and in fact the power which he or she refused to exercise. As a

question of law, it is one of interpreting the empowering statutory provisions. As a

question of fact, it must be shown that the factual situation envisaged by the

empowering statute in reality exists.

Thus, while the public authority must be under a legal or public duty to carry out the

act which a petitioner demands, and have the power to carry out the said duty, the

petitioner in turn must have a legal right to the performance of such public duty. In

Kaluarachchi vs Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Others,4 Fernando J, referring to

the judgment in Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs M/s Jafferjee and

Jafferjee (Pvt) Limited5 reiterated that, the foundation of mandamus is the

existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a Writ of Mandamus to enforce a

right which is not legal and not based upon a public duty.

I shall now consider whether the Petitioners have satisfied the above criteria.

In order to have a legal right or in other words, to be eligible in terms of P4 for the

payment of salaries and allowances, there are two requirements that must be

satisfied.

The first is that the Police Officer must have been permanently disabled. I have set

out in the following table the nature of the disability suffered by each of the

Petitioners, as set out in the report of the Medical Board.

PetitionerDocument Nature of the injury Permanent disabled

1st P2a Gunshot injury. Paraplexic Yes 100%

2nd P2b Not clear Yes 100%

3rd P2c Acid attack on eyes. Blind Yes 100%

4th P2d Not specified Yes 100%

5th P2e Not specified Yes 100%

6th P2f Not clear Yes 100%

7th P2g Not specified Yes 100%

4 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019. 5 [2005] 1 Sri LR 89.

8th P2h Not specified Yes 100%

9th P2i Totally blind.

Amputation of left forearm

Yes 100%

10th P2j Not specified Yes 100%

The position of the Petitioners that they are permanently disabled is supported by the Medical Reports. However, either due to an oversight or otherwise, the Respondents have claimed that they are unaware of the averments in paragraphs 3-6 of the amended petition, which are the paragraphs that have set out the fact that the Petitioners have suffered permanent disabilities. Although the Petitioners have not submitted, either with their petition or counter affidavit, any document issued by the Police Department confirming that they are permanently disabled, the fact that a Government Medical Board have certified their disability, as well as their inability to work as a result of such disability, is sufficient proof that the Petitioners have complied with the first requirement of P4. The second requirement that must be satisfied to qualify under P4 is that the permanent disability must be as a result of injuries suffered whilst performing operational duties, or as a result of terrorist activity, or other law enforcement measures. As I have already observed, the Petitioners have stated that the 6th 10th Petitioners have sustained injuries whilst performing operational duties or due to terrorist attacks, while the rest of the Petitioners suffered their injuries during the line of duty. However, in view of the position taken up by the Respondents that they are unaware of the averments in paragraph 5 of the amended petition,6 the Petitioners should have responded by annexing the necessary material with their counter affidavit, which the Petitioners unfortunately have not done. Therefore, in the absence of any material to justify the position of the Petitioners with regard to the cause of their disability, I regret that I am unable to arrive at any conclusion with regard to the cause of the disability suffered by the Petitioners, or to determine whether the Petitioners are covered by P4.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that:

6 Paragraph 5 of the petition reads as follows: The Petitioners state that 1st 10th Petitioners are Police Officers. The 1st to 5th Petitioners became persons with disabilities (disabled) as a result of the injuries sustained whilst performing other law enforcement measures. Whereas the 6th 10th Petitioners became persons with disabilities (disabled) as a result of the injuries sustained whilst performing operational duties or by terrorist activities.

11

(a) The Petitioners have failed in their duty to establish that they have a legal right

to the payment of allowances in terms of P4; (b) The Petitioners are not entitled to the Writ of Mandamus prayed for. This application fails as the Petitioners have not established that they have satisfied part of the criteria laid down in P4. However, in view of the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that the Respondents will make every endeavour to ensure the payment of all allowances and arrears to those who are eligible, this Court directs the 1st Respondent: (a) To ascertain within six weeks from today whether the Petitioners satisfy the

criteria laid down in P4; (b) To initiate necessary action within ten weeks from today to obtain the required

financial allocation, if one or more of the Petitioners are eligible for the payment of salaries and allowances in terms of P4 and have satisfied the eligibility criteria set down by the Police Department; (c) Once such financial allocation is made available to the 1st Respondent, to effect

the payment of allowances that are payable in terms of P4 including arrears, to those Petitioners who have satisfied the eligibility criteria set down by the Police Department. Subject to the above, this application shall stand dismissed. I make no order with regard to costs.
