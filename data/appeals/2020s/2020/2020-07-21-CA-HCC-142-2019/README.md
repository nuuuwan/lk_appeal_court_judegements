01. The 3rd Accused-Appellant (Appellant) with two others was indicted in the High Court of

Balapitiya with one count of Robbery punishable in terms of section 380 of the Penal Code.

The Appellant was the 3 rd Accused in the case and the trial proceeded in the absence of the

Appellant and the 2nd Accused. Only the 1 st Accused was present at the trial. After the trial

the learned High Court Judge found the 1st Accused not guilty of the charge, and the 2nd

Accused and the Appellant were convicted. The Appellant was sentenced to 5 years rigorous

imprisonment and was also imposed a fine of Rs. 5,0001-. Being aggrieved by the said

conviction, the Appellant preferred the instant appeal.

02. Learned counsel for the Appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

1. The learned High Court Judge relied on the identification parade evidence that has

not been proved by the prosecution.

2

2. The learned High Court Judge failed to take into consideration the infirmities in

the evidence regarding the identification and the objection taken by the Accused at

the identi fication parade.

3. The learned High Court Judge failed to analyze the evidence against the Accused-

Appellant and failed to give reasons as to why she acted on the evidence of the

identification parade.

As all three grounds urged relate to the identification of the Appellant, they will be

considered together.

03. As per the version of the prosecution, on 03.07.2006, witnesses G.D. Nimal (PWI) and Pieris

Singo Jayasinghe (PW2) were distributing cigarettes in a van. Pieris had been the driver and

Nimal was the salesman. There had been a safe box in the van where they kept the collected

money. When they stopped at a junction to distribute cigarettes to a shop, three or four people

who were armed had come and dragged the driver out of the driving seat and put him at the

back of the van. They had also put Nimal inside the van and had driven the vehicle for about

20 minutes and had stopped at an isolated area, where they were thrown out of the van. The

robbers had left driving the van with the cigarettes and the money. They had called the police

and the organization they worked for, and reported the matter to the police. On a later date

they both had identified some of the robbers at an identification parade held in the

Magistrate's Court.

04. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Acting Magistrate who conducted the

identification parade was not called as a witness and none of the officers who assisted in

holding the parade testified at the trial either. Only the 1st Accused who appeared at the trial

admitted the identification parade notes and the other Accused including the Appellant cannot

be bound by that admission. Therefore, it is the contention of the learned counsel that the

identification parade notes were not properly admitted in evidence.

3

05. Section 414(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act provides for admission of

identification parade notes even if the Magistrate who conducted the parade is not called to

testify as a witness.

Section 414(2);

" .... The depositions regarding an idenlificalion parade (or the notes

thereof) held by a Magistrate or Justice oj the Peace and the deposilions oJ the

wilnesses who assisled Ihe Magistrale or the Justice oJthe Peace 10 hold the parade

or affidavits by Ihem may be given in evidence in any inquiry, Irial or proceeding

under this Code although the deponents or the Magistrate or Ihe Justice oJlhe Peace

or the witnesses reJerred 10 are nol called 10 lesti/Y as witnesses. "

06. As the learned counsel for the Appellant rightly submitted, the admission made by the 1 SI

Accused admitting the identification parade notes cannot be taken as an admission made by

the Appellant as well. However, as the Appellant was absconding and the trial proceeded in

his absence, no objection on the part of the Appellant was raised for admitting the

identification parade notes in terms of section 414(2). Therefore, the learned Trial Judge was

well within his powers when he admitted the identification parade notes in evidence without

calling the Acting Magistrate who held the identification parade as a witness, in terms of

section 414(2). The notes of the identification parade were unchallenged. Hence, the ground

of appeal No.1 urged by the Appellant should necessarily fail.

07. Learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence of all witnesses listed, who

assisted in holding the identification parade must be led in evidence to show that the

identification parade was properly held. Counsel further submitted that at the identification

parade the Appellant was not afforded the opportunity to change places when the 2nd witness

was called to identify the suspects. There are inconsistencies in the evidence of witness Pieris

in Court and the statement made to the Acting Magistrate who held the identification parade,

about the Accused who drove the van. Counsel submitted that the learned High Court Judge

has failed to analyze the evidence.

4

08. The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent submitted that as the

Appellant absconded, there was no opportunity to identify the Appellant from the dock.

Witness Pieris had been 79 years old at the time he testified in Court on the robbery that had

taken place II years ago.

09. Learned DSG further submitted that the inconsistency in the evidence referred to by the

learned counsel for the Appellant was in the evidence of one witness, however, two witnesses

testified about the incident.

10. The notes of the identification parade held by the learned Acting Magistrate were lawfully

admitted in evidence, as I mentioned before. The notes of the said parade were unchallenged.

On careful scrutiny of the parade notes admitted in evidence, it is observed that the learned

Acting Magistrate had taken all precautions to see that the parade was held fairly. He had

specifically mentioned that all doors and windows of the hall were closed and that no one

outside could see what was happening inside. Further, witnesses and the Accused were kept

separately and also witnesses who participated in the parade were also kept separately. These

notes as to the procedure that was followed in holding the parade were unchallenged.

II. As submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant, the suspects including the Appellant

had taken up an objection to the parade being held before the Acting Magistrate. The

objection was that at the Pitigala police station they were shown to some unknown persons.

Nothing was mentioned about the two witnesses even after they were called to identify the

suspects at the identification parade. No such objection or even a suggestion was made to the

officers of the Pitigala police station who testified at the trial. Hence, there is no merit in that

objection.

12. Both witnesses Nimal and Pieris Jayasinghe identified the Appellant at the identification

parade, as a person who participated in the robbery. Nimal in his evidence at the trial said that

he identified some of the suspects at the identification parade. Witness Pieris Jayasinghe also

in his evidence at the trial said that he identified two suspects at the identification parade.

When the State Counsel asked him whether the person who dragged him from the van is in

Court, he said, "@C)@t5JZ5> /Y){C}",C) @@"',." (page 164 of the brief). In Court he had identified

the I SI Accused from the dock, as the person who dragged him out of the van (page 164 of the

brief).

13. [t is pertinent to note that there had been two instances where witness Pieris was dragged out

of the vehicle. The first was when he was dragged out of the driving seat and put in the back

seat. The second was where he was dragged out of the vehicle at an isolated area.

The above evidence of Pieris at page 164 clearly refers to the incident when he was thrown

out to the road after they were taken in the back seat to an isolated area, not the incident of

initially taking him out of the driving seat. At page 163, he referred to the initial incident of

him being taken out of the driving seat, but did not identify the person who dragged nim out

of the driving seat. In his examination in chief witness Pieris never identified the 1st Accused

from the dock as the person who drove the van after putting them in the back of the van.

14. His evidence on him being dragged out of the driving seat was (page 163 of the brief);

15. Referring to the first incident where he was taken out of the driving seat, he said that the van

was driven after he was removed from the driving seat by the person who was at the bus halt.

However, in his examination in chief he never pointed to the first Accused as the person who

was at the bus halt who later drove the van.

16. However, in cross examination (at page 166 of the brief, last question), it seems that the

defence counsel has put a misleading question to Peiris, assuming that he identified in

examination in chief that the I st Accused was the person who drove the vehicle, when he had

not.

17. Section 143 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that;

"143(1) Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination, subjecllo the

following qualifications:-

(a). ...

7

(b). the question must not assume that facts have been proved which

have not been proved, or that particular answers have been

given contrary to the fact. "

When this question was put to the witness, the learned State counsel had failed to object to

the above question in terms of the above section 143(I)b. It appears to have escaped the mind

of the learned Trial Judge as well. Thus, although it has not been objected to in terms of

section 143(1 )b, the question is inadmissible. It will not be made admissible merely because

no objection was taken, as it contravenes section 143(l)b of the Evidence Ordinance.

18. However, answering the above misleading question, Pieris conceded that he identified in

Court that the 1st Accused drove the vehicle. Under those circumstances, the learned defence

counsel had tried to show an inconsistency in his evidence in Court and what he said at the

parade to the Acting Magistrate. However, Pieris explained the circumstances in Court and

said (page 167 of the brief);

19. An identical issue was discussed at length in case of Atllllioraialage Nihal Perera alld

allother V. The Attorney Gelleral CA Appeal No. 43-4412002 all 05.08.2005.

In that case the witness identified at the identification parade, the 2nd Appellant as the person

who shot and snatched the bag containing cash, but after 6 years, in Court he identified the 151

Appellant as the person who did so. The other witness identified the 151 Appellant as the

person who was on the motor cycle. His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew said;

"Taking inlo accounl the above observalions and Ihe period of lime

passed after Ihe identificalion parade, 1 am of Ihe opinion thai it was possible

for Saman Fernando 10 make a mislake on the idenlity of Ihe Appellants and

his mislake is not capable of crealing a doubl in the evidence of

Dharmaralne. "

20. In the instant case, witness Pieris was 79 years old when he testified in the Court on the

incident that had taken place II years ago. In such circumstances his memory may fade. We

are dealing with human beings and some allowance must to be left for such weaknesses.

Pieris was not the only witness who identified the Appellant at the identification parade.

Nimal also identified the Appellant. Evidence of witness Nimal at the trial on the

identification of suspects in the identification parade, and the notes of the Acting Magistrate

who held the identification parade were unchallenged. Therefore, the learned High Court

Judge was entitled to conclude that the Appellant was properly identified as a person who

took part in the robbery.

21. In case of Joseph Aloysius V. AG 1992 2 Sri L.R.254, the law relating to identification

parades were considered. It was held that even though there were no express provisions

regarding identification parades in our country, it should be conducted in a manner that

would befit the interest of justice. Evidence of identification would only be excluded if the

Court finds that its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the

proceedings.

22. Having carefully gone through the notes of the identification parade that were unchallenged, I

am of the considered view that the identification parade had been held fairly, and no

prejudice has caused to the Appellant. Although the analyzing part on identification in her

9

judgment is concise, the learned High Court Judge has considered the above aspects in her

judgment. On the evidence placed before her, the learned High Court Judge could not have

come to a conclusion other than that of finding the Appellant guilty of the offence as charged.

I find that the grounds of appeal are without merit.

Appeal is dismissed.
