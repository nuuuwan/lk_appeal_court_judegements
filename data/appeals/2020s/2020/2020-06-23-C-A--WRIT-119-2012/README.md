Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

At the time material to this application, the Petitioner Company

had been exporting jar-sealing rubber rings. In one

consignment, black marks were found on the product to be

exported. It was evidently an act of foul play, as incisions by a

needle were found in packed boxes containing the product.

Following the said discovery, the lockers of the employees were

searched, and a syringe without a needle was found in the lower

shelf of the locker used by the workman represented by the 4th

Respondent Union in these proceedings. The workmans

services were suspended on 29.10.2007 and a domestic inquiry

was held upon a charge sheet contained in a Show Cause letter

dated 11.12.2007.1 The workmans position was he was

unaware of the said syringe in the lower shelf of his locker,

which had been previously used by another employee about

three years ago. This explanation was not accepted at the

domestic inquiry. The workman was found guilty of all the

charges against him and his services were terminated effective

from the date of suspension.2

On the recommendation of the Commissioner General of Labour,

the Minister of Labour acting in terms of section 4(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, as amended, referred

the dispute to the 3rd Respondent Arbitrator for arbitration.

The learned Arbitrator, having held an inquiry into the matter

where both parties were fully heard, made the Award dated

09.12.2011, whereby reinstatement of the workman with back

1 Page 16 of the brief. 2 Page 483 of the brief.

5

wages was ordered upon the finding that the termination of

services of the workman was unjustifiable.3 The Petitioner

employer filed this application before this Court seeking to set

aside the said Award by way of a writ of Certiorari.

At the argument before this Court, learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner took up four positions to challenge the Arbitral

Award.

The first relates to the onus of proof placed by the Arbitrator in

paragraph 7 of the Award. This part reads as follows:

The burden is on the Respondent employer to prove the

following facts by leading evidence.

(i) That the workman brought without authority an

empty syringe and kept it in the locker exclusively

used by him.

(ii) That the workman brought a black coloured liquid

and with the assistance of the syringe injected the

said colour liquid into the polythene bags containing

rings.

It is the contention of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that placing the burden of proving these two matters

on the Petitioner is unwarranted, and once the Petitioner proves

the syringe was found in the locker exclusively used by the

workman, the burden shifts to the workman to establish he is

not responsible for the sabotage.

3 Vide page 474 et seq of the brief and the Gazetted Award marked P2.

6

This argument does not commend itself to me. As correctly

pointed out by learned Counsel for the workman, the Arbitrator

identified the above two matters to be proved by the Petitioner

because those are the main charges on which the workman was

found guilty at the domestic inquiry which led to his dismissal

from service.

The first three charges contained in the Show Cause letter

issued by the Company to the workman read as follows:4

1. Bringing into the Company premises without authority

an empty syringe which item is not required for the

Managements productivity process.

2. Having brought in an empty syringe without authority

keeping such item in your personal locker where only an

Employees personal clothing and personal items are

permitted to be kept of which the keys are in your sole

custody and possession.

3. That you have attempted to use this syringe brought in

without authority for the purpose of undermining the

productivity purpose of the Company by injecting liquid

with carbon into Jar Sealing in polythene bags which

are in the cardboard boxes.

The above have been identified as proven charges in the letter

of Termination of Employment sent to the workman by the

4 Vide page 16 of the brief.

7

Company.5 It is on this basis the workmans services were

terminated.

Hence there is no illegality or impropriety on the part of the

Arbitrator to expect the Petitioner to prove the aforesaid

identified issues to the satisfaction of the Arbitrator.

The second point raised by learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner is linked to paragraph 16 of the Award, which runs as

follows:

H.A.K. Chandana the workman was a very active Secretary

in the Branch Union of the Richard Peiris Limited. A

reasonable person in the relevant context would think that

the Respondent employer has enough calculated reasons to

get rid of H.A.K. Chandana, who was the Secretary of the

Branch Union.

Learned Presidents Counsel vigorously submits this position

was not taken up by the workman and further states it goes to

prove the mindset of the Arbitrator in deciding this matter.

I am unable to agree. Learned Counsel for the workman drew

the attention of the Court to the written submissions filed by the

Petitioner at the end of the inquiry before the Arbitrator.6 In the

said written submissions, the Petitioner identified four issues to

be decided by the Arbitrator. The issues (translated into

English) are as follows:

5 Vide page 483 of the brief. 6 Vide page 456 of the brief.

8

1. Was the accused acting in the role of Branch Secretary

of the Trade Union at the time material to the incident?

2. Was the Trade Union resentful of the Companys refusal

to enter into a mutual agreement?

3. Were there tensions/misunderstandings between the

Management of the Company and members of the Trade

Union around the time material to the incident?

4. Was the syringe used to inject black liquid into the box

containing rubber rings with the motive of terminating

the employment of the accused, who was acting as the

Branch Secretary of the Trade Union?

It is in this context the Arbitrator made the said observations in

the Award.

The third ground of learned Presidents Counsel is predicated on

the second part of paragraph 18 of the Award. This paragraph

reads:

I reject the suggestion that the workman injected a black

coloured liquid to the packets containing the rubber rings.

Merely because an empty syringe, without needle had been

found in a workers locker, it is not reasonable to conclude

that a black coloured liquid had been introduced into ring

packets kept in another section (ring section) using that

syringe especially in view of the fact that none of those who

checked the locker found black liquid on the syringe at the

time of checking.

9

Taking everything into consideration I am of the view that

the syringe and the needle had been introduced into the

locker by a friendly hand of the company. I reject the

suggestion that the workman injected a black liquid to the

packets containing the rubber rings.

Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously contends it was never

the position of the workman that the syringe was introduced by

the Petitioner with the intention of getting rid of him from the

establishment, but the Arbitrator has taken up such a position

in the Award.

Learned Counsel for the workman accepts the workman did not

take up such a position at the domestic inquiry or before the

Arbitrator. However, Counsels position is the Arbitrators

finding that the syringe was introduced into the locker by a

friendly hand of the company cannot be given the meaning

attributed to it by learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner.

It is not exactly clear what the Arbitrator meant by the said

phrase. However, I do not think we need to cudgel our brains to

interpret it, as that sentence is not decisive. The decisive

sentence is the one which follows it, i.e. I reject the suggestion

that the workman injected black coloured liquid to the packets

containing the rubber rings.

The final point raised by learned Presidents Counsel relates to

the Test Report called for by the Petitioner from the Industrial

Technology Institute regarding the contents of the syringe.7 It is

the submission of learned Counsel for the workman that the

7 Vide page 316 of the brief.

10

said Report cannot be relied upon, as the syringe was tampered

with in the process. Learned Presidents Counsel states he does

not rely on the Report but refers to it to say the Arbitrator failed

to address his mind to the said Report. If the Petitioner does not

rely on the Report, failure on the part of the Arbitrator to refer to

it in the Award cannot make any difference. There is no

necessity to further dwell on this point.

In the result, the Petitioner fails in the main argument.

However, the matter does not end there. During the course of

the argument, learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner took

up two new positions:

(a) Even if this Court determines the Arbitrator was correct

in deciding the termination of employment of the

workman is unjustifiable, the order for reinstatement of

the workman shall still be quashed.

(b) Once the Award is repudiated in terms of section 20 of

the Industrial Disputes Act, which has been done in

this case, the Award becomes null and void and of no

legal effect whatsoever.

First I will consider the question of reinstatement. On what

basis does learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submit

that reinstatement should not have been ordered? It is on the

sole basis no reasons were given by the Arbitrator for making

the order of reinstatement. This argument is unacceptable in

the unique facts of this case.

11

In the written complaint/application before the Arbitrator, the

workman sought reinstatement with back wages as the only

relief for his services being unjustifiably terminated by the

Petitioner.8 In the answer/reply, the Petitioner sought only the

dismissal of the workmans application on the basis the

termination was justifiable.9

It was never the position of the Petitioner before the Arbitrator at

any stage of the proceedings that, in the event the Arbitrator

decided the termination to be unjustifiable, given the unique

facts and circumstances of this case, payment of compensation

should be ordered as an alternative to reinstatement. Simply

stated, in the event the termination was found to be

unjustifiable, the relief to be granted was uncontested and

uncontroverted. It is for the first time at the argument stage in

this Court the Petitioner states compensation should have been

ordered instead of reinstatement. Let me remind, the Petitioner

does so on the basis no separate reasons have been given by the

Arbitrator in granting the said relief. I am not inclined to agree.

Whether or not compensation as an alternative to reinstatement

should be awarded, and if so, how much should be so awarded,

are not pure questions of law which can be raised for the first

time before a writ Court. These are disputed questions of fact

and law, the findings of which necessarily involve close analysis

of the evidence led at the Arbitration proceedings. This is not

the task of the writ Court. In the facts and circumstances of

this case, the Arbitrator cannot be found fault with for granting

8 Vide page 8 of the brief. 9 Vide page 10 of the brief.

12

the said relief upon arriving at the firm finding the termination

of services was unjustifiable.

This leads me to consider the last point raised on behalf of the

Petitioner, which relates to the repudiation of the Arbitral

Award. The Award was made on 09.12.2011 and Gazetted on

24.02.2012. The Petitioner repudiated the Award in terms of

section 20 of the Industrial Disputes Act. This repudiation was

Gazetted on 01.06.2012 to take effect on and after 24.02.2013,

i.e. upon expiration of one year from the effective date of the

Award (24.02.2012). The Petitioner admits the Commissioner

General of Labour took steps to enforce the Award by instituting

proceedings in the Magistrates Court prior to 24.02.2013.10

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner contends once the

Award is repudiated, it is null and void (ab initio), and the case

law as at present (i.e. the repudiation is prospective) has not

properly interpreted the section. He further submits the purpose

of enacting the section is not relevant, and any other

interpretation would mean that someone could enforce an Award

before repudiation. I regret my inability to agree.

If I may start from the latter part of the submission any other

interpretation would mean that someone could enforce an Award

before repudiation, what about the flip side of the question?

That is, if repudiation simply makes the Award a nullity, ab

initio, what is the purpose of referring a matter for industrial

Arbitration under section 4 of the Industrial Disputes Act? The

whole process can be invalidated by the party against whom the

10 Vide the affidavit dated 28.10.2013 of the Manager, Industrial Relations of the Petitioner Company filed in seeking an interim order.

13

Award is made simply by a notice of repudiation. I have no

scintilla of doubt the legislature would never have intended such

mischief. I must also add that although it is submitted the

purpose of enacting the section is not relevant, the purpose of

the section is relevant in order to give purposive interpretation to

it.

I need not go so far. Even a literal interpretation of the said

section does not support the Petitioners view. Let me explain.

Section 20 of the Act, insofar as is relevant to the present

purposes, reads as follows:

20(1) Any party, trade union, employer or workman, bound

by an award made by an arbitrator under this Act, may

repudiate the award by a written notice in the prescribed

form sent to the Commissioner and to every other party,

trade union, employer and workman bound by the award:

(2) Where a valid notice of repudiation of an award is

received by the Commissioner, then, subject as hereinafter

provided

(a) the award to which such notice relates shall cease

to have effect upon the expiration of three months

immediately succeeding the month in which the

notice is so received by the Commissioner or upon the

expiration of twelve months from the date on which

the award came into force as provided in section 18

(2), whichever is the later; and

14

(b) the Commissioner shall cause such notice to be

published in the Gazette, together with a declaration

as to the time at which the award shall cease to have

effect as provided in paragraph (a):

According to section 20(2), giving notice of repudiation of an

Award does not make the Award null and void ab initio. It

ceases to be operative upon the expiration of three months

immediately succeeding the month in which the notice is so

received by the Commissioner or upon the expiration of twelve

months from the date on which the award came into force,

whichever is later. Section 20(2)(b) particularly enacts the

Commissioner shall declare in the Gazette the time at which the

award shall cease to have effect.

This means, the Award is valid from the date on which it comes

into force, until it ceases to have effect on repudiation. After the

Award ceases to have effect as a result of repudiation, the new

terms and conditions between the employer and employee shall

be founded upon inter alia the terms and conditions of the

Award. This is the interpretation given to the section by the

Supreme Court in Thirunavakarasu v. Siriwardena [1981] 1 Sri

LR 185.

The submission made on behalf of the Petitioner the case law

as at present is that the repudiation is prospective; that is the

award ceases to be operative upon the expiration of twelve

months from the date on which the award came into force, or

three months immediately succeeding the month in which the

notice is so received by the Commissioner whichever is the later

15

has not properly interpreted the section and it is not relevant

whether it is prospective or retrospective, the award ceases to

have effect when it is repudiated cannot be accepted.

The interpretation given to section 20(2) by case law is, in my

view, in keeping with the spirit and purpose of the Act.

In Thirunavakarasu v. Siriwardena (supra), the question posed

before the Supreme Court was whether or not an award once it

is repudiated, has the effect, as it were, of wiping the slate clean

so that the award and its effects will disappear altogether as if

they had never existed from the inception. The Supreme Court,

both on principle and practice, rejected the argument that

repudiation wipes out the Award in toto. Wanasundera J., with

the agreement of Samarawickrema J. and Ismail J., stated at

193-194:

The award in the case of an arbitration therefore is not

intended to be a respite and to provide a temporary

breathing space leaving the parties free thereafter to reopen

the disputes. No; the award is intended to be a true

settlement of the existing dispute and that settlement is

made binding on the parties with the sanction of the award

behind it. What the award seeks to do is to resolve the

dispute by formulating a new set of terms and conditions,

which are fair and reasonable to both parties, and imposing

such terms on the parties so that these terms and

conditions will supersede the original position of the parties

and provide a new relationship that would henceforth guide

the conduct of the parties. These terms and conditions are

16

statutorily made implied terms in the contract of

employment. In addition to that, the award will be binding

on the parties and is made operative in its character of an

award for a minimum period of twelve months. This means

that there are some special sanctions, including criminal

sanctions to back the award in its character as an award.

During that period and in respect of that period when the

award will subsist, all rights and liabilities pertaining to the

award in its character as an award can be enforced as an

award.

The law no doubt allows a repudiation of the award at any

time after the required minimum period. What then is the

effect of such a repudiation? In my view such a repudiation

can have only prospective application and cannot affect any

rights and obligations that have already accrued to the

parties and have become terms and conditions of service.

From and after the date of repudiation the parties are freed

from the constraints and fetters of the award in its nature

as an award. Henceforth the parties would be at liberty to

order their affairs like any other employer or employee but -

and this is important - any change that is sought can only

be effected from the prevailing position; by this I mean that

the terms and conditions then subsisting (which will include

those that came in by way of the award) must necessarily

form the starting point. A repudiation of an award in my

view can never result in a going back to the contentious

position of the parties which had originally prevailed at the

time of the dispute. To do so would be to devalue the

17

concept of arbitration altogether and to make arbitral

proceedings an almost useless exercise.

This dictum was followed in later cases as representing the

correct position of the law in relation to repudiation of Arbitral

Awards. (Vide Kulatunga v. Labour Officer, Colombo South [1987]

1 Sri LR 1, Fernando v. United Workers Union [1989] 2 Sri LR 199,

Ceylon Electricity Board v. Alavi Moulana [2006] 3 Sri LR 1) This

Court is bound by the said decision.

In the Supreme Court case of Fernando v. United Workers Union

(supra) G.P.S. de Silva J. (later C.J.), with the concurrence of

Ranasinghe C.J. and Jameel J., stated at 204 the view that the

award is operative for a minimum period of 12 months is

supported on a plain reading of the section.

The application of the Petitioner is dismissed with costs.
