*************

HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

The seventeen Petitioners, who are either owners of properties that

are located along Pituwala Road, Elpitiya or residents of those buildings,

have invoked the jurisdiction conferred by Article 140 of the Constitution

on this Court, seeking issuance of Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition. The

Petitioners thereby seek to quash the approval granted by the 1st

Respondent by letters dated 06.04.2015 and 04.06.2015 (marked as "P6"

and P11" respectively) to erect a high tension electricity line of 160 kV A

along the left side of the said Pituwala Road in close proximity to their

properties, in order to supply electricity to Merry Kids International

School, managed by the 5th Respondent, and the decision of the 4th

Respondent to draw the said electricity line. The Petitioners also seek the

issuance of Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st to 4th Respondent from

erecting the said electricity line.

After an inquiry on 20.07.2015, as to issue of granting interim relief

as sought by the Petitioners, this Court made order granting interim relief

as prayed for in paragraph" e" of the prayer to the Petition. Subsequently

an amended caption has been tendered by the Petitioners citing 7th added

Respondent in lieu of the 5th Respondent, who was only an employee of

the Merry Kids International School who was subsequently discharged

from these proceedings.

The Petitioners claim, In support of the factual basis of their

application, that the proposed electricity supply line would expose them to

a very dangerous situation as it would expose them to the threats of

lightning, electrocution, serous health risk including cancers. In addition, it

would hinder further development of the area as the power line would act

as ceiling to the number of stories to any building could have, which are

located along left side of the Pituwala Road.

The factual background to the legal basis on which the Petitioners

have sought to challenge on the validity of the approval granted by the 1st

Respondent is described in the Petition. The Petitioners claim that upon

their objection and request to opt for an alternative route to the proposed

power line, the 1st Respondent held an inquiry by arbitrarily selecting only

some of those who objected to the proposal. The 1st Respondent had

thereafter conveyed his approval to the 2nd Respondent for the erection of

an electricity line subject to the conditions set out in his letter of approval

dated 06.04.2015 ("P6").

It is also claimed by the Petitioners that " the 1st Respondent had

failed to consider the alternatives available for the proposed project and

6

Website Copy Website Copy

had decided arbitrarily to lay electricity cables over and/ or closer to

Petitioners' buildings" and thereby causing a serious threat and danger to

their lives and properties. After the said approval, the Petitioners have

proposed another alternative route through which the electricity supply to

the Merry Kids International School could be provided but the 1st

Respondent had failed to hold an inquiry but had "made a determination

to draw the electricity line as per his decision dated 04.06.2015 by placing

the disputed electricity poles inside the lands."

The Petitioners claim that the l si Respondent had arrived at the

aforesaid arbitrary decision without considering the alternatives that are

available and thereby causing serious hardships on them. Therefore, the

Petitioners state that the said decisions of the lsi Respondent ("P6" and

''Pll'') are "contrary to law, arbitrary, irrational and contrary to the rules

of natural justice." They also contend that the said decision to grant

approval for the proposed power line had violated their personal rights as

well as rights over their properties.

The matter was taken up for hearing on 19.11.2019 and the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the impugned approvals should

be quashed as the Petitioners were not called for the inquiry under Section

3 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009. Learned Counsel also

submitted that the Section 1(2) of the said Act, made it mandatory for a

licensee in order to place an electric line on or over a street, to obtain

consent of the local authority. It was also submitted that Section 17 of the

Act No. 31 of 2013, had amended the Schedule I and made it mandatory

for the 151 Respondent, being the Divisional Secretary of the relevant area,

to conclude the inquiry within a period of six weeks, if the licensee is 7

Website Copy Website Copy

unsuccessful in its efforts to secure the grant of a way leave. The

Petitioner's claim that these mandatory requirements were not complied

with the 1st Respondent in granting the impugned approvals as per "P6"

and "PI!" and had failed to hear them in holding that inquiry.

It was also contended by the Petitioners that the scientific research

conducted on the adverse health effects on humans who live in close

proximity to high tension power lines clearly indicate the existence of a

substantial risk of causing cancer and similar illnesses such as leukaemia

and thus the proposed power line poses a serious health hazard.

In the light of these submissions by the Petitioners, this Court must

examine the question whether the impugned approvals are tainted with

any defect recognised by public law principles, which warrants the

issuance of a prerogative writ in exercising discretion vested in this Court.

In Mendis v. Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha Santhaka

Pravahana Sevaya and Others (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 284 Silva J. stated:

"It us thus seen that prerogative remedies such as Certiorari

and Prohibition lie in situations where statutory authorities

wielding power vested by Parliament exercise these powers to

the detriment of a member of the Public. The essential

ingredient is that a member of the public who is affected by

such a decision has to submit to the jurisdiction of the

authority whose action is subject to review. In other words,

there is an unequal relationship behveen the authority

wielding power and the individual who has to submit to the

jurisdiction of that authorihj. The principles of

8

Website Copy Website Copy

Administrative Law that have evolved such as the doctrine of

ultra vires, error on the face of the record, rules of natural

justice, requirement of procedural fairness and the

reasonableness of decisions , coupled with the remedies by

way of prerogative Writs, lie to correct any illegality or

injustice that may emanate from this unequal relationship."

On the question of denial of an opportunity for the Petitioners to

voice their grievance over the proposed power line, the 1st and 4th

Respondents have annexed two sketches of the path along which the

proposed power line would be drawn. The two sketches shown in the

document marked as "lR6 - lO(k)" shows the two options that are

available along the Pituwala Road for the proposed power line. The said

document was addressed to the 1st Respondent apparently by the 2nd

Respondent, informing him of the change of the path of the proposed

power line as shown in 2nd sketch after considering the objections raised

by the affected persons. Having noted that the initial proposal would have

affected the building of the 2nd Petitioner, the 2nd Respondent suggested to

draw the power line on the opposite side of the road and thereby

preventing any damage to the building of the 2nd Petitioner.

It is noted by this Court that, of the 17 Petitioners, only the 2nd, 4th,

10th and 11th Petitioners are affected with the proposed power line as their

properties are located along the original path of the said power line. None

of the other Petitioners were identified in the two sketches. The Petitioners,

in their counter affidavit, although referred to the document lR6, opted

9

Website Copy Website Copy

not to challenge non identification of the other 13 Petitioners from these

two sketches. Therefore, it is undisputed that only the 2nd, 4th, 10th and 11th

Petitioners are directly affected by the proposed power line.

In all the correspondence in relation to the inquiry, these four

Petitioners were named and their participation is sought in the inquiry

into the objection to the proposed power line. Document marked "lR5C -

10(c)" annexed to the objections of the 1st and 4th Respondents, indicate

that from the initial 17 persons who objected, the proposed path of the

power line would have any effect only on four of these Petitioners.

However, only two of them had participated in the inquiry that was

conducted.

The 1st Respondent directed the four Petitioners be called to his

office to have their views expressed. The 1st Respondent informed the 17

persons who initially objected to the proposed power line, to be present for

an inquiry by his letter dated 12.11.2014 marked as "IR4C -100)" and then

had limited the number of the persons who participated at the subsequent

inquiry date to the four Petitioners, who were clearly affected as per his

letter dated 24.02.2015, marked as "IR4D -100)". In the impugned

approval marked as "P6" or "lR7 - 10(1)", the 1 st Respondent refers to the

date of inquiry held on 04.03.2015, and his decision had been conveyed to

these four Petitioners.

Therefore, the claim of the Petitioners that the said inquiry was

conducted with the participation of a selected few and thereby the 1st

Respondent had violated rules of natural justice by depriving of an

10

Website Copy Website Copy

opportunity of being heard, is clearly based upon a distorted version of the

attendant circumstances.

In countering the submissions of the Petitioners that the mandatory

provisions of consent of the local authority is not obtained by the

Respondents, it was submitted by learned Counsel for the 7th Respondent

that Section 3 of the Act No. 31 of 2013 had amended the principal

enactment with the insertion of Section 2A after the existing provision of

Section 2. Section 2A(I)(b) empowered the Public Utilities Commission to

delegate its powers under items 3,4,5 and 6 of the Schedule I of the Sri

Lanka Electricity Act to "any Divisional Secretary" and in this instance, the

1st Respondent had been delegated to exercise those powers. The consent

to place a line on or over a street could be obtained either from the local

authority or "other relevant authority" as per Section 1(2) and the

Petitioner's complaint of non-compliance of certain mandatory provisions

therefore has no valid basis.

The 1st Respondent had considered the alternative routes through

which the proposed power lines could be drawn. As these alternatives are

not economically viable, and having minimized the effect on the concerned

parties, the 1st Respondent had then decided the path, along which the

power line could be drawn now challenged by the Petitioners.

The reference to the Public Utilities Commission in the preceding

paragraph remind this Court to the position taken up by the Respondents

that the Petitioners have failed to name the said Commission as a party

and upon their failure to name necessary party to the application the

Petition is clearly defective. This was not taken up by the Respondents as a

11

Website Copy Website Copy

preliminary issue at the hearing of this application and only referred to

during their submissions on the relative merits and demerits of the

application. However, since the 7th Respondent made submissions that the

powers of the said Commission had already been delegated to the 1st

Respondent. The Respondents have then taken the position that it is the

1st Respondent and not the Public Utilities Commission that is the

naming party to this Application. Therefore the issue does not arise for

consideration.

Approval for the proposed power line granted by the 1st Respondent

is subjected to the condition that the proposed power line should be

drawn upon the existing electricity poles which are already installed to

supply electricity to the area. Thus, the proposed power line would not

result in any change in the environment or causing any damage to

property.

In this situation the only concern would be the possible exposure to

a health hazard of the Petitioners by the proposed power line as claimed

by them.

In order to strengthen the challenge mounted on the approvals

granted by the 1st Respondent to erect a power line adjacent to their

properties on health hazard, the Petitioners have annexed two documents

to their petition marked "P5" and "P5A". The document "P5" is an extract

from the British Journal of Cancer (2013) 108, from where the report of a

study conducted under the title " Childhood leukaemia close to high

voltage power lines - the Geocap study, 2002- 2007".

12

Website Copy Website Copy

The study (P5 and P5A) concerns the issue whether living in close

proximity to High Voltage overhead power lines and exposure to the

extremely low magnetic field such power lines generate could be

"considered a possible risk factor for childhood leukaemia". The study

was based on the findings made by International Agency for Research on

Cancer and its conclusion was such exposure had resulted in "... an

increase in childhood acute leukaemia". However, this conclusion is in

relation to living in close proximity to 225 to 400 kV range power lines.

Thus, this study is not directly helpful to the Petitioners who sought

to challenge the erection of proposed power line on two aspects. Firstly,

there is no statement of any children living in the "affected" properties

and secondly, the proposed power line is for a supply of only 160 kVA and

power not 225 to 400 kV range of power lines as the study had focused

on. This study had no findings on the power lines in the range the 7th

Respondent needed. To counter the claim that the proposed power line

posed a serious health risk, the 7th Respondent relied on article annexed to

his objections as " 7R3-a" , "7R3-b", where the accuracy of such study

findings are challenged but admit that it is a widely held fallacious view.

It appears from this limited reference to few articles, that the opinion

of the scientific community over this issue is inconclusive.

13

Thus, it is clear that from the above considerations, the approvals

granted by the 1st Respondent with the issuance of letters "P6" and "PU"

is not tainted with any defect warranting it to be quashed by this Court

with the issuance of Writ of Certiorari.

Application of the Petitioners is therefore refused. The Petition of the

Petitioners is accordingly dismissed.

Parties will bear their costs.
