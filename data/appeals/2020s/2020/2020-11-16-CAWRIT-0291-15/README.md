Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a company limited by guarantee and a non-profit organization having as its

objectives, inter alia, the protection, preservation and conservation of nature and environment

and the promotion and advancement of the concepts of environmental justice and good

governance in the interests of the general public.

In this public interest litigation it seeks to impugn several acts of the Respondents in the forest

complex adjoining Wilpattu National Park, i.e. Northern Sanctuary of Wilpattu National Park,

Maraichukkaddi/Karadikkuli Reserve Forest standing westward of Wilpattu blocks II and IV and

the forest area in Madu, Periyamadu and Mannar area which is part of the Madu Road

Sanctuary and Madu Road Reserved Forest.

The principal submission of the Petitioner is that these areas have been declared as reserved

forests (P4) in terms of section 3 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance as amended (Forest

Conservation Ordinance) and that around 1500 families have been illegally settled in this area

contrary to law. This declaration was significantly made on 21st September 2012 and published

in Gazette Extraordinary dated 10th October 2012. As provided by section 3 of the Forest

Conservation Ordinance, it specifies that the area covered will be a reserved forest with effect

from 20th October 2012. I shall refer to the significance later on.

Page 4 of 14

According to the journal entries when the argument began on 31.07.2019, the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner referred to this Gazette notification (P4) and the Court enquired from the

learned Senior State Counsel appearing on behalf of the 1st to 6th and 8th and 9th Respondents

(Respondents) whether the land forming the subject matter of this application falls within the

area covered by P4. The learned Senior State Counsel acting in the highest traditions of the

Attorney-Generals department obtained instructions and informed Court that the land forming

the subject matter of this application is covered by P4. The Court wishes to place on record our

commendation to the learned Senior State Counsel.

Section 7 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance (as amended by Act No. 65 of 2009) prohibits

several types of activity in a reserved forest including fresh clearing, clearing or breaking up any

land for cultivation or any other purpose, erection of any building whether permanent or

temporary or occupation of such building and constructing any road.

According to the statement of objections filed on behalf of the Respondents, the land forming

the subject matter of this application was cleared and several houses and roads have been

constructed in order to settle the internally displaced persons (IDP) who were ordered to leave

the Northern Province in October 1990 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. On this

evidence the provisions of section 7 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance has been breached in

the settlement of the IDPs.

The Respondents state that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) had

recommended in its Report that the Government take steps to resettle IDPs and that the

Government should access all possible sources of assistance from institutions and individuals

both national and international. The Respondents state that in taking the initiative of resettling

IDPs in the Northern Province the Respondents were fulfilling their obligations both under

domestic and international law.

Page 5 of 14

No doubt there is a need to settle down all IDPs who were displaced due to the war in Sri Lanka

as far as possible in the areas where they were residing. However, this is subject to other

overriding concerns and above all the respect for the rule of law which is the basis of our

Constitution [Visvalingam v. Liyanage (1983) 1 Sri.L.R. 236; Premachandra v. Jayawickrema

(1994) 2 Sri.L.R. 90]. The rule of law in its fundamental meaning requires that all acts must be

according to law. Where land has been declared as reserved forest in terms of the Forest

Conservation Ordinance, no person is entitled to act contrary to law and carry out activities

such as clearing of forest, construction of houses and roads within this area.

Chapter VI of the Constitution enumerates the Directive Principles of State Policy which are to

guide the Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers in the enactment of laws and

the governance of the country for the establishment of a just and free society. Article 27 (14) of

the Constitution, mandates that the State shall protect, preserve and improve the environment

for the benefit of the community.

The order P4 declaring several areas as reserved forest in terms of the Forest Conservation

Ordinance are a practical application of this constitutional directive. It makes the provisions of

section 7 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance applicable to the land in dispute and seeks to

conserve the reserved forest.

The evidence before Court establishes that vast extent of reserved forest land has been cleared

and used for the resettlement of IDPs in breach of the provisions of the Forest Conservation

Ordinance.

The contention of the Respondents is that the land forming the subject matter of this

application has been used for re-settlement in terms of decisions made by the Presidential Task

Force for Resettlement, Development and Security (Northern Province) (1R2) and the

Committee appointed by the Task Force to make recommendations to resolve land related

issues in Muslim Villages Displaced in 1990 (1R2 and 1R3).

Page 6 of 14

However there is no documentary evidence before Court to substantiate this assertion.

Accordingly on 31.07.2019 the Court enquired from the learned Senior State Counsel whether

the land forming the subject matter of this application was used for the re-settlement based on

any recommendation made by this Committee or the Task Force. Having moved for time to

obtain instructions, he was unable to provide the clarification sought by Court. Instead Court

was informed, by motion dated 22.11.2019 that, inter alia, steps will be taken to rescind the

order P4 and a new order made excluding the land used for the settlement of the IDPs and that

if further re-settlements are necessary every effort will be made to relocate IDPs outside

reserved forest.

In any event the Report of the Inter Agency Committee on Land Related Issues among the

Muslim Families Internally Displaced in the Year 1990 (Mannar District) is dated 15.10.2012

(1R3) whereas the land forming the subject matter of this application became reserved forest

with effect from 20.10.2012.

Hence on the evidence before Court neither the Task Force nor the Committee appointed by

the Task Force played any role in identifying and releasing the land forming the subject matter

of this application for re-settlement of IDPs after it was declared as a reserved forest.

However there is evidence that it was the 7th Respondent Mr. Rishad Badiudeen, Minister of

Industry and Commerce who was instrumental in getting this land released for the re-

settlement of IDPs. On 15.01.2013 a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the 7th

Respondent with the participation of the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable

Energy, Director General of Forest Conservation and his officers and a decision was made to

release several lands for the re-settlement of IDPs (P7). Deplorably the then Conservator

General of Forest K.G. Ariyadasa compliantly took part in the meeting and signed P7 containing

the decision to release the reserved forest land.

Such a release of reserved forest land for re-settlement of IDPs could have been done only if

there had been an order made by the Minister in terms of section 4(2) of the Forest

Conservation Ordinance declaring that the land in dispute is no longer reserved forest. No such

order has been made.

Page 7 of 14

Therefore, the Court concludes that the re-settlement of the IDPs was made in violation of the

provisions of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The question then is the relief that Court will

grant in this application.

The Petitioner has sought the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing orders made by the 1st and 6th Respondents in respect of

the alleged clearing of Maraichukkaddi/Karadikkuli Northern Sanctuary of Wilpattu

National Park Forest complex of Madu Road Sanctuary and Madu Road Forest Reserve

and construction of housing project more fully described above without compliance to

the prevailing law and to remove said illegal constructions.

(b) A writ of mandamus to order the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 8th Respondents to perform the

statutory duties more fully described in the petition in respect of the illegal clearing and

illegal re-settling of encroachers in Maraichukkaddi/Karadikkuli Northern Sanctuary of

Wilpattu National Park Forest complex of Madu Road Sanctuary and Madu Road

Reserved Forest and construction of housing project more fully described above without

obtaining approval for the same from a project approving agency in the performance of

the statutory duty in compliance with the provisions of the National Environmental Act,

Forest Ordinance and Fauna and Flora protection Ordinance and Antiquities Ordinance

as amended.

(c) An order in the nature of mandamus ordering the 1st Respondent to take action against

the illegal removal of forest cover, and illegal re-settlement done by the encroachers

and re-instate the forest lands to the forest reserve and organize forest replanting

programme under and in terms of the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907

as amended.

The relief sought in terms of the writ of certiorari cannot be granted as necessary parties have

not been made Respondents to this application. It is trite law that all those who would be

affected by the outcome of the application for writ of certiorari should be made respondents

[Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thero and Four

Others (2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 258 at 267]. The Respondents have pleaded that re-settlement has

Page 8 of 14

taken place in areas forming the subject matter of this application and have tendered the lists

of names of the persons re-settled [1R6(a) to 1R6(e)]. However, the Petitioner failed to add

these parties as Respondents even after their names were disclosed.

The relief sought in terms of a writ of mandamus must also fail for the same reasons as the rule

of necessary parties applies to this remedy as well.

In this application the Court is exercising the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Article 140 of the

Constitution and the Supreme Court has held that this jurisdiction is not limited to the issuing of

prerogative writs such as writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus etc.

The jurisdiction conferred by Article 140, however, is not confined to prerogative writs, or

extraordinary remedies, but extends subject to the provisions of the Constitution to

orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari etc. Taken in the context of our Constitutional

principles and provisions, these orders constitute one of the principal safeguards against

excess and abuse of executive power; mandating the judiciary to defend the sovereignty of the

People enshrined in Article 3 against infringement or encroachment by the Executive, with no

trace of any deference due to the Crown and its agents. Further this Court itself has long

recognized and applied the public trust doctrine: that powers vested in public authorities are

not absolute or unfettered but are held in trust for the public, to be exercised for the purposes

for which they have been conferred, and that their exercise is subject to judicial review by

reference to those purposes [Heather Therese Mundy v. Central Environmental Authority and

Others (S.C. Appeal No. 58/2003, S.C.M. 20.01.2004)].

Therefore the remaining relief for an order in the nature of mandamus ordering the 1st

Respondent to take action against the illegal removal of forest cover, and illegal re-settlement

done by the encroachers and re-instate the forest lands to the forest reserve and organize

forest replanting programme under and in terms of the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No.

16 of 1907 as amended is one that this Court is permitted to issue. The question of necessary

parties does not arise here as long as the order made by Court does not affect any person who

is not a party to this application.

Page 9 of 14

The learned Senior State Counsel raised an objection that a writ of mandamus cannot be issued

since the 1st Respondent has been named by office. He cited the decision of this Court in

Indrakumara v. Land Reform Commission [C.A. (Writ) 271/2013, C.A.M. 15.10.2019]. It is true

that when this application was filed the 1st Respondent was cited by reference to his official

designation. However, on 10.11.2017 the Petitioner filed an amended caption and brought in

Anura Satharasinghe, Conservator General as the 1st Respondent. Therefore this objection is

overruled.

A further objection was raised by the learned Senior State Counsel that this Court is denuded of

any power to grant relief as the identical matter was urged before the Supreme Court in

S.C.F.R. No. 130/2017 where leave to proceed was refused.

This Court has had the benefit of perusing the pleadings filed in S.C.F.R. 130/2017 since they

have been filed of record in this application. I observe that the Petitioner in this case was not a

party to that application. Hence the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel do not apply as in

both instances it is necessary that the parties to the two cases and the cause of action (or issue

estoppel as in this case) must be the same for the two doctrines to apply. [Ran Menika v.

Gunasena and Another [C.A. 471/2000(F), C.A.M. 23.09.2019].

In any event, it is trite law that the rights of the parties must be decided as at the date of the

institution of the proceedings or action [Ponnammah v. Arumugam (8 N.L.R. 223), Sithy

Makeena and Others v. Kuraisha and Others (2006) 2 Sri.L.R. 341]. This application was filed and

notice issued in 2015 whereas the fundamental rights application S.C.F.R. 130/2017 was filed in

2017. Hence the outcome of the fundamental rights application cannot be held against the

Petitioner in this application.

It was further contended by the learned Senior State Counsel that this application is futile in

that the re-settlement has been completed and that no meaningful purpose can be achieved by

this application. I have no hesitation in overruling this objection.

Page 10 of 14

Although the re-settlement has been completed, that does and should not in any way restrain

the Court from making orders in the interest of justice and upholding of the rule of law. The re-

settlement has been done in breach of the law and the Court must do all what can be done

within the law to address the unlawful acts.

This can be done by considering the type of relief that can be granted in terms of the prayer for

an order in the nature of mandamus ordering the 1st Respondent to take action against the

illegal removal of forest cover, and illegal re-settlement done by the encroachers and re-instate

the forest lands to the forest reserve and organize forest replanting programme under and in

terms of the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 as amended.

Court is mindful of the decisions in Dayananda v. Thalwatte [(2001) 2 Sri.L.R. 73] and

Environmental Foundation v. Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs [(C.A. (Writ) 243/2017, C.A.M.

07.11.2017] which lays down that the prayer in a writ application must be set out with precision

and clarity. However, in the instant application, the Petitioner has prayed for an order in the

nature of mandamus which this Court is empowered to issue [See Heather Therese Mundy v.

Central Environmental Authority and Others (supra)].

In any event, the judiciary is part of the State [Centre for Policy Alternatives v. Dayananda

Dissanayake (2003) 1 Sri.L.R. 277 at 292] and is bound to protect, preserve and improve the

environment for the benefit of the community as directed by Article 27(14) of the Constitution.

In my view procedural requirements should not be an obstacle to the Court giving effect to this

Directive Principle of State Policy in public interest litigation such as this application as it is one

made on behalf of the community and the lapse of the pleader, if any, should not be allowed to

compromise the rights of the community at large.

In India, the Supreme Court has recognized the power vested in the High Court in moulding

remedies in the exercise of the writ jurisdiction vested in it by Article 226 of the Indian

Constitution to do substantial justice between the parties [C.M. Singh v. H.P. Krishi Vishva

Vidyalaya and Ors. (1999) 9 SCC 40] and, that an application should not be thrown out simply

on the ground that the proper writ or direction has not been prayed for [Chiranjit Lal v. The

Union of India A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 41]. It is open to the Court to mould the relief and to grant the

Page 11 of 14

consequential or ancillary relief so as to restore the position to what it was before the impugned

action was taken by the concerned authority [Consumer Education and Research Centre v. State

LNIND 1981 Guj 51, AIR 1981 Guj 233].

Polluter Pays Principle

The polluter pays principle enshrined in Principle 16 of the Rio De Janeiro Declaration has been

recognized and applied by the Supreme Court of India on numerous occasions [Indian Council

for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India (2011) 8 SCC 161; Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v.

Union of India AIR 1996 SC 2715; M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath (1997) 1 SCC 388; M.C. Mehta v.

Union of India AIR 1987 SC 965, S. Jagannath v. Union of India (1997) 2 SCC 87; M.C. Mehta v.

Union of India (1997) 2 SCC 411].

The Polluter Pays principle as interpreted by the Indian Supreme Court means that the absolute

liability for harm to the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of pollution

but also the cost of restoring the environmental degradation. Remediation of the damaged

environment is part of the process of sustainable development and as such, the polluter is liable

to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing the damaged ecology.

The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has also recognized and applied the Polluter Pays principle

[Bulankulama and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and Others (2000) 2

Sri.L.R. 243; Wijebanda v. Conservator General of Forests (2009) 1 Sri.L.R. 337; Kariyawasam v.

Central Environment Authority and Others [S.C.F.R. 141/2015, S.C.M. 04.04.2019]. In

Bulankulama and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development and Others (Supra. at

305)] Amerasinghe J. held that the costs of environmental damage should be borne by the

party that causes such harm rather than being allowed to fall on the general community to be

paid through reduced environmental quality or increased taxation in order to mitigate the

environmentally degrading effects of a project.

Page 12 of 14

Having taken into consideration all the circumstances of the case, Court issues an order in the

nature of mandamus ordering the 1st Respondent (Conservator General, Department of Forest

Conservation) to take action to implement a tree planting programme under and in terms of

the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 as amended in any area equivalent to the

reserve forest area used for re-settlement of IDPs.

Article 28(f) of the Constitution dictates that it is a fundamental duty of every person in Sri

Lanka to protect nature and conserve its riches. This includes public officials and

representatives of the people like the 7th Respondent.

In view of this constitutional duty it would be a travesty of justice to require the State and

consequentially the tax payer to bear the costs of this programme when the 7th Respondent

was instrumental in getting the reserved forest released for the re-settlement of the IDPs.

Although it is true that no relief has been sought by the Petitioner against the 7th Respondent,

this in my view does not prevent the Court from applying the polluter pays principle against the

7th Respondent and granting ancillary or consequential relief against him. He is a party to this

application and has filed objections and written submissions through his pleader. In any event,

the prayer to the petition seeks such and further relief as Your Lordships Court shall seem

meet which in my view is sufficient to cover consequential or ancillary relief against the 7th

Respondent.

Therefore, Court issues an ancillary or consequential order directing the 7th Respondent Rishad

Badiuddeen to bear the full the cost of such tree planting programme applying the polluter

pays principle since according to the evidence before Court he was instrumental in using the

reserved forest land for the re-settlement of the IDPs. The Conservator General, Department of

Forest Conservation (1st Respondent) is directed to calculate the costs of the tree planting

programme directed by Court and inform the 7th Respondent of this cost and the details of the

account to which the said sum should be paid by him within two-months of the date of this

judgment. The 7th Respondent shall pay the said sum within one month of such notification.

Page 13 of 14

The judgment of this Court is based on a clear violation of the law as explained above.

However, before I part, let me emphasis that the protection of the environment is a matter that

has been recognized in international law as well as in many religions.

In Gabcikovo-Nagimaros project (Hungary/Slovakia) case [1997 General list N 92 25th

September 1997], Vice President of the ICJ Judge C.G. Weeramantry in his separate opinion

held that the protection of the environment is a vital part of the contemporary human rights

doctrine and that it is a sine qua non for numerous rights such as the right to health and the

right to life itself and that damage to the environment can impair and undermine all human

rights spoken in the Universal Declaration and other human right instruments.

In Bulankulama and Others v. Secretary, Mininstry of Industrial Development and Others

(Eppawela Case) [(2000) 3 Sri.L.R. 243 at 253] Amerasinghe J. stated:

The organs of State are guardians to whom the people have committed the care and

preservation of the resources of the people. This accords not only with the scheme of

government set out in the Constitution but also with the high and enlightened

conceptions of the duties of our rulers, in the efficient management of resources in the

process of development

In Buddhism, the Kutadanta Sutta states that it is the responsibility of the government to

protect trees and other organic life and that government should take active measures to

provide protection to flora and fauna. According to Hinduism, when a person is engaged in

killing creatures, polluting wells, and ponds and tanks, and destroying gardens he goes to hell

(Padmapurana, Bhoomikhanda 96.7-8).

Page 14 of 14

C.G. Weeramantry in Tread Lightly on the Earth, Religion, The Environment and the Human

Future [Stamford Publication, 2014] cites various religious texts to emphasis that several

religions speak of the need to protect the environment and follow sustainable development. He

states (at page 228) trusteeship of the universe is recognized in Islam and any violation of it by

man is accountable and subject to punishment as the Quran states It is He who made you

trustees of the earthIndeed your Lords retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind

(6:165).

As Rousseau wrote in Emile, forgetfulness of all religions leads to the forgetfulness of the

duties of man. [Rousseau, Jean Jacques, Emile: or On Education, 1762, Book 4, p. 929]

Before parting with the judgment, I reiterate that without any doubt there is a need to settle

down all IDPs who were displaced due to the war in Sri Lanka as far as possible in the areas

where they were residing. However this is subject to other overriding concerns and above all

the respect for the rule of law which is the foundation of our Constitution. The conclusions I

have made and the relief granted is based on the finding that the re-settlement of the IDPs in

this case has been made contrary to law.

Application partly allowed.
