OJ. The Suspect-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as Petitioner) has invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court seeking to revise the order made by the High

Court of Kaluthara on 02.04.2020 in case No. BA 34/20 19, refusing to enlarge him

on bail.

02. The petitioner had been produced before the Magistrate's Court of Kaluthara on

06.01.2019, in case No. 93364119, as the 2nd suspect, for committing offences under

Section 300 of the Penal Code and Section 44(a) of the Fire Arms Ordinance as

amended, and was remanded.

03. An application for bail had been made before the High Court of Kaluthara. The

main ground urged before the High Court had been that the Petitioner had been in

remand custody for more than a year, and therefore he is entitled to be released on

bail in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act. Although the learned State Counsel who

appeared for the respondent before the High Court did not object to bail being

granted to the Petitioner on the basis that one year had lapsed in remand, and the fact

that the Attorney General had not made an application in terms of Section 17 of the

Bail Act for further remand, the learned High Court Judge refused to release the

Petitioner on bail. The reason for refusal mentioned in the order by the learned High

Court Judge was, that the Petitioner had pending cases of similar offences.

04. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner strenuously argued that the Petitioner is entitled

to be released on bail in terms of Section 16 of the Bail Act, and as the Attorney

General had not made any application in terms of Section 17 seeking for further

remand, the learned High Court Judge had erred in refusing bail.

05. Although the learned State Counsel had filed objections to the application, at the

inquiry stage she conceded that the Attorney General had not made any application

in terms of Section 17 seeking for further remand of the Petitioner.

06. It is an undisputed fact that the Petitioner had been in remand for more than a year

for this case by the time the order refusing bail was made by the High Court.

07. The issue this Court has to address is whether a suspect to whom the Bail Act

applies can be kept in remand for more than one year, irrespective of Section 16 of

the Act, when there is no application seeking further remand by the Attorney

General in terms of Section 17.

4

08. This issue was discussed at length by a Divisional Bench of this Court in the case of

Wickramasinghe V. Attorney General and Another /2010j 1 Sri LR 141 where it

was held that;

"The maximum period that a suspect to whom the Bail Act applies can be

kept on remand is 2 years, the period of 2 years is considered only if the

Attorney General acts under section 17. If there is no application under

section 17 the maximum period that a suspect/accused to whom the Bail Act

applies can be kept on remand is 1 year. "

09. The Court further held that Section 16 and 17 of the Bail Act are not subject to

Section 14.

10. Hence, the learned High Court Judge was in error when the Petitioner to whom the

Bail Act applies was refused bail by his order dated 02.04.2020, when in fact the

petitioner had been in remand for more than a year, and the Attorney General had

not made any application in terms of Section 17.

II. Therefore, we set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 02.04.2020,

and order that the petitioner be released on bail on the following conditions.

12. When deciding on the bail conditions we take into consideration the pending cases

against the Petitioner, reported by the respondent;

1. Rs. 2000001- cash bail

2. Surety bail of Rs. 20000001- each with two sureties acceptable to the

learned Magistrate. One of the sureties has to be a permanent public

servant. When accepting the sureties, the learned Magistrate has to satisfy

himself with the means of the persons to stand as sureties to meet the surety

bond.

3. Upon being released on bail, the Petitioner is to report at the Kaluthara

North Police Station every Sunday between 9am and 2pm.

Revision application is allowed.
