Hon. K.K. Wickremasinghe, J

Counsel appearmg for the Appellant informs Court that he is

withdrawing the appeal against the conviction. Therefore the conviction of

the accused-appellant is affirmed.

Learned Counsel for the Appellant informs Court that the

Accused-Appellant has committed the offence under knowledge. When

considering the judgment it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge

also has considered that the Appellants have committed the offence under

knowledge (page 172 of the brief). Learned DSG appears for the Respondent

concedes to the above facts. Therefore according to Section 297 of the Penal

Code it states that.. ............ ...................... ..... .

" with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the

knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause

death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. "

Therefore whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder

where the act is done with knowledge shall be punished for a maximum

of 10 years imprisonment. Accordingly, considering the prescribed sentence,

we set aside the 12 years imprisonment sentence and substitute 8 years

sentence imprisonment. Further, this court order that the fine and the default

sentence to remain unchanged. Eight years rigorous imprisonment to be

operative from the date of the sentence imposed namely 06.09.2018.

Subject to the above variation of the sentence the appeal IS

hereby dismissed without costs.
