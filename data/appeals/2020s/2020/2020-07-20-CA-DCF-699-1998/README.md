Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Matale to

partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint among

the Plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd Defendants. At the preliminary

survey, the 3rd Defendant had come forward as a claimant.

Later, the 4th Defendant intervened as a party Defendant. At the

3

trial, only the Plaintiffs husband and the 3rd Defendant gave

evidence. The only contest at the trial was whether or not the

3rd Defendant had acquired prescriptive title to Lot 1 of the

Preliminary Plan. The learned District Judge has answered it in

the negative and entered Judgment partitioning the land,

including Lot 1, among the Plaintiff, the 2nd and 4th Defendants.

The rights of the 1st Defendant have been left unallotted. The 3rd

Defendant, who admittedly constructed the buildings on Lot 1,

has not even been awarded compensation on the basis that the

said buildings are not bona fide improvements. However, the 3rd

Defendant has been allowed to remove the improvements, if she

so desires. Aggrieved of this Judgment, the 3rd Defendant has

preferred this appeal.

The 3rd Defendant is not a co-owner of this land. She is a

stranger to it. She came to the land in 1966 upon her marriage

to the son of Dingiri Manika, who was in possession of Lot 1 in

the Preliminary Plan. This is acknowledged by the District

Judge in his Judgment.

The Plaintiffs husband admitted in his evidence that it is the 3rd

Defendant who constructed the buildings in Lot 1 marked A-D

about 20 years prior to the trial, and none of the other parties

have built houses on the land.1 According to the Preliminary

Plan, there are no other buildings on the land except those

marked A-D. It appears the house marked A was constructed by

Dingiri Manika. The witness further stated that their attempts

to build houses on Lot 1 was foiled by the 3rd Defendant. The

3rd Defendants possession of the land has also been affirmed in

the Magistrates Court proceedings.2

The Report to the Preliminary Plan marked Y makes it clear that

Lot 1 is in possession of the 3rd Defendant, to the exclusion of all

other co-owners. At the survey, according to the said Report,

the Plaintiff had informed the surveyor that the 3rd Defendant is

in forceful possession of Lot 1, and that Lot 1 should also form

part of the land to be partitioned.3 This means, the 3rd

Defendant has been in possession of Lot 1 as a separate Lot.

Against this overwhelming evidence, which in my view proves

prescriptive possession of the 3rd Defendant, why did the learned

District Judge hold against the 3rd Defendant?

As I stated earlier, the learned District Judge admits in the

Judgment that the 3rd Defendant has come into possession of

the land in 1966 upon her marriage to the son of Dingiri

Manika. Who is Dingiri Manika? Dingiri Manika is also not a co-

owner of this land. According to the learned District Judge,

Dingiri Manika came to the land on the leave and license of the

2nd Defendant. I cannot understand on what basis the District

Judge has come to the said finding. There is no mention of it in

the plaint. In my view, it is not clear from the evidence of the

Plaintiffs husband that Dingiri Manika came into possession of

the land as a licencee of the 2nd Defendant. The portion of

evidence the District Judge appears to have relied on in this

regard is the following:

.4 It is not clear from the above piece of evidence

whether Dingiri Manika came to look after the 2nd Defendant. If

Dingiri Manika had come to look after the 2nd Defendant, how

and why she commenced possession of the 2nd Defendants

portion is still a mystery. If Dingiri Manika came to possess the

2nd Defendants portion as a licencee, as the learned District

Judge says in his Judgment, the 2nd Defendant could have given

evidence on that important point. She did not do so. In fact,

according to the proceedings, although all the other parties had

come to Court on the trial days, the 2nd Defendant did not and

no issues were raised on her behalf at the trial.

The District Judge says the 3rd Defendant cannot claim

independent rights to the land, as the 3rd Defendant came to the

land upon the rights of Dingiri Manika. I cannot agree. Dingiri

Manika was not a co-owner of the land. Nor has it been proven

to the satisfaction of the Court that she was a licencee under the

2nd Defendant. Therefore, the fact that the 3rd Defendant came

to the land under Dingiri Manika does not disqualify the 3rd

Defendant from claiming prescriptive title against the co-owners

of the land.

The District Judge, in my view, erred on both fact and law by

rejecting the prescriptive claim of the 3rd Defendant.

I answer issue nos. 5-7 in the affirmative and direct the learned

District Judge to exclude Lot 1 in the Preliminary Plan from the

land to be partitioned. Subject to the foregoing, I affirm the

Judgment of the District Court.

The appeal of the 3rd Defendant is allowed but without costs.
