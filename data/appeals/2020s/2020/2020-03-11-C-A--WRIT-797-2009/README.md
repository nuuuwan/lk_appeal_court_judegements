Before: Janak De Silva J.

Counsel:

Harindri Seneviratne for the Petitioners

Chaya Sri Nammuni SSC for the 3,d Respondent

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioners on 08.03.2019

Respondents on 28.03.2019

Decided on: 06.03.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioners are seeking the following relief:

Member, Public Service Commission, No. 177,

Nawala Road, Narahenpita, Colombo 05.

All being Members of the presently incum-

bent Public Service Commission, C/O the

Secretary, Public Service Commission, No. 177,

Nawala Road, Narahenpita, Colombo 05.

Added 30A - 38A Respondents

(a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Secretary, Ministry of Public Ad ministration

and Home Affairs and/or the Engineering Service Board, pertaining to the denial/refusal

to promote the Petitioners to SLES (Class II Grade II);

(b) Several Writs of Mandamus directing the Respondents to re-evaluate the Petitioners and

promote them to the SLES (Class II Grade II).

This order pertains to a preliminary jurisdictional objection raised by the learned Senior State

Counsel that this Court does not have jurisdiction in terms of Article 61A of the Constitution to

hear and determine this matter.

Th e learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that this is not a matter that should be

considered by Court since it was raised belatedly by the Respondents.

The preliminary objection goes to the root of the jurisdiction of this Court as it involves a

constitutional ouster. It is a patent Idck of jurisdiction and hence even if it is raised belatedly that

cannot vest this Court with jurisdiction it does not possess.

As Tennakoon c.J. explained in Beatrice Perera v. The Commissioner 01 Notional Housing (77

N.L.R. 361 at 366)

"Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance t hat results in a judgment or order th at

is void. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction

over the cause or matter or over t he parties; it may also lack competence because of

failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the exercise of

power by th e Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; th e first mentioned of these is

common ly known in the law as a 'patent' or 'total' want of jurisdiction or a delectus

jurisdictionis and th e second a 'latent' or 'con tingent' want of jurisdiction or a delectus

triotionis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or orders which are

void. But an important difference must also be noted. In th at class of case where the want

of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of

jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer

jurisdiction on a tribun al which has none would be to admit a power in the parti es to

litigation to create new jurisdictions or to exten d a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits,

both of which are within the exclusive privilege of th e legislature; the proceedings in cases

within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable. In the

other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, th e judgment or

order of the Court will be void only against th e party on whom it operates but

acquiescence, wa iver or inaction on th e part of such person may estop him from making

or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that th e Court was

lacki ng in contingent jurisdiction.

The only issue before Court is the backdating of the appointments given to the Petitioners since

pending this application, they have been promoted to SLES (Class II Grade II). This is not disputed

by the Petitioners who adm it that these appointments were given by the Public Service

Commission (PSC) as the appointing authority.

Article 61A of the Constitution

In Atapattu v. People's Bank [(1997) 1 SrLL.R. 208] the Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction

of the Court of Appea l set out in Article 140 of the Constitution can only be ousted by a

constitutional provision. Article 61A of the Constitution is an example of such an ouster.

The approach this Court should take to the constitutional ouster in Article 61A ofthe Constitution

was dealt with in great detail by Marsoof J. in Ratnosiri and others v. Ellawola and others [(2004)

2 Sri.L.R. 180 at 190] where he held:

"In view of th e elaborate scheme put in place by the Seventeenth Amendment to the

Constitution to resolve all matters relating to the public service, this Court would be

extremely reluctant to exercise any supervisory jurisdiction in the sphere of the public

service ... 1 have no difficulty in agreeing ... that this Court must apply the preclusive clause

contained in Article 61A of the Constitution in such a manner as to ensure that the

elaborate scheme formulated by the Seventeenth Amendment is given effect to the

fullest extent."

Furthermore, the ouster clause in Article 61A of the Constitution does not insulate the PSC from

all forms of judicia I supervision as the fundamental rights jurisd iction vested in the Supreme Court

by Article 126 of the Constitution is preserved in all its vigour and any party whose fundamental

rights are infringed or is in imminent danger of infringement has recourse to that jurisdiction.

The backdating of the appointments of the Petitioners is a matter for the PSC as the appointing

authority. Article 61A of the Constitution prevents this Court from interfering with that process.

I uphold the preiiminary objection raised by the learned Senior State Counsel and dismiss this

application without costs.
