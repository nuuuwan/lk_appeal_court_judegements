Counsel:

K.V.S. Ganeshrajan with Sriranganathan Ragul and K. Nasikethan for the Petitioner

Thisath Wijegunawardena P.e. with Ajith Dayaratne for 1'1 and 2nd Respondents

Supported on: 20.11.2019 and 10.12.2019

Decided on: 20.12.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the quit notice dated

26.03.2019 marked "PS" issued by the 1'1 and/or 2nd Respondents in terms of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 as amended (Act). The land

forming the subject matter is identified therein as Wanarajah Watta - Glencairn

portion (New Valley portion) containing A.1 R. 2 P. 0 in extent.

The Petitioner seeks to assail "PS" on a two-fold basis. Firstly, it is submitted that

the 1'1 Respondent is not the owner of the said land which is a portion of Norwood

Estate which is being manged by the 3,d Respondent under and by virtue of lease

agreement bearing no. 162 dated 14.10.1993. Secondly, it is submitted that the

land occupied by the Petitioner and the land claimed in the quit notice are two

different lands.

Ownership

The Petitioner claims that the land in issue was vested in the Janatha Estates

Development Board (JEDB) by the 1't Respondent in terms of an order made by the

Minister of Agriculture Development and Research in terms of sections 42H read

with section 27A of the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972 as amended (Law) and as

such P5 is ultra vires the powers of the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents.

The relevant gazette is marked as 1033 annexed to P6. Therein items 15 and 20

describes New Valley (part of Wanaraja Estate) containing in extent 144.11

hectares and Wanarajah Estate containing in extent 544.62 hectares respectively.

The 1't and 2nd Respondents disputed this position and drew attention of Court to

document marked 1032 annexed to P6 which is the declaration under section 42C

of the Law pertaining to Wanarajah Estate which contains A. 1757 R.1 P. 39 in

extent. Thus, it was submitted that the total extent of Wanaraja Estate was not

vested in the JEDB and that there still exists a portion of Wanaraja Estate vested in

the 1't Respondent.

The issue then is whether the land forming the subject matter of the application

made under the Act is land vested in the 1't Respondent or in the JEDB. The parties

are taking contrary positions and it is thus a disputed question of fact.

Our courts have consistently held that it will not exercise writ jurisdiction where

the facts are in dispute [Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another (1981) 2

Sri.loR. 471). The Supreme Court has in Dr. Puvanendran and another v. Premasiri

and two others [(2009) 2 Sri.loR. 107, 2009 BLR 65) held that the Court will issue a

writ only if the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result of the facts are

not subject to controversy.

The rationale is that where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the

facts is subject to controversy it is necessary that the questions should be

canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the

witnesses so that the Court would be better able to judge which version is correct.

In fact, in Wijenayake and others v. Minister of Public Administration [(2011) 2

SrLL.R. 247] this Court held that the material furnished suggest that a

title/boundary dispute is agitated before the Kurunegala District Court and as such

finality (subject to appeal) of title and boundary of the land in dispute lies in the

action filed in the District Court of Kurunegala and that these are all disputed facts

which cannot be decided in a writ court.

Identity of Land

The Petitioner further claims that the land occupied by the Petitioner and the land

claimed in the quit notice are two different lands and as such the quit notice "PS"

is bad in law.

If that be the case then there is no danger of the Petitioner's rights been affected

by the quit notice "PS" since as S.N. Silva J. (as he was then) held in C.A. 1299/87,

C.A.M. 14.06.1995, ifthe case of the party summoned is that he is in occupation of

another land, then he would not be ejected from the land he is in occupation upon

a writ that will be issued in the Magistrate's Court.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner has failed to make out a prima facie

case for the issue of notice. Notice is refused and application dismissed without

costs.
