PIIC-O I 06/09 lie IIAMBANTOTA lie WA 35/2007

161 Upon a request made by the Walasmulla Police by letter dated

09.05.2007, the 7"' Respondent by letter dated 16.05.2007 informed the

Officer-in-charge of the Walasmulla Police that the names of the tenant

cultivators were clearly set out in the AgIicultural Lands Register and thus,

requested dIe Oflicer-in-charge of Police to take necessary stesps to secure

dIe rights and ensure dIe security of dIe said tenant cultivators (P7).

171 The 7

ili Respondent held all inquiry drrough an Agrarian Services

Officer into dIe complaint of eviction (P6) made by dIe Respondents and

made dIe determination on 07.09.2007 (P8) dismissing the complaint of

eviction made by dIe Respondents.

181 A perusal of dIe determination of dIe 7"' Respondent reveals dlat he has

dismissed dIe complaint of eviction not for dIe want of jurisdiction in terms

of dIe provisions of dIe Agrari,m Development Act No. 46 of 2000 but

purely on dIe basis dlat (i) in terms of the Final Decree of dIe Panition

action in D.C. Hambantota Case No. P/2200 (P5), the Appellant was

declared entided to die absolute ownership of dIe paddy land in question;

(ii) dIe Respondents had not appealed against dIe said judgI11ent; (iii) the

Fiscal had delivered possession of dIe paddy land to dIe Appellant; and (iv)

dillS, dIe Appellant is dIe absolute owner and the owner cultivator of dIe

paddy land in dispute.

Application for writ of certiorari and mandamus to the High CouIt

191 Being aggI'ieved by dIe said order of dIe 7" Respondent, dIe

Respondent~ in dIe present appeal filed an application in dIe Provincial

High Coun of Hambantota and prayed for dIe following reliefs:

(a) a writ of certiorari to quash dIe detemlination of dIe 7ili Respondent

dated 07.09.2007 marked "P8";

(b) a writ of mandamus directing the ]''' Respondent to act according to

the Final Decree entered in die said p;u"tition Case be;u"ing No.

Decision of the High Court

IlOI After inquiIy, die le;mled High Court Judge by judgment dated

25.05.2009 issued a writ of certior;u"i quashing die determination of die 7"'

Respondent dated 07.09.2007 miu'ked "P8" for die I()llowing reasons:

I. The Appellant who was die Plaintiff in die said partition action has

admitted dlat Sayindara iUld N ikulas were named as die 2"" iUld 3"'

Defendants on die basis dlat were die tenant cultivators of the said

paddy land and die Plaintiff sought a partition widlOut pr~judice to

die rights of die said tenant: cultivators;

2. In terms of section 7 (2) of die Agriu"ian Development Act No. 16 of

2000, a tenant cultivator shall be regarded as die temU1t cultivator of

;U1y extent of paddy ];U1d which is purchased by any person under

die piU"tition law or which is allotted to a co-owner under a decree of

partition;

3. The 7'" Respondent has wrongflilly dismissed die complaint of

eviction on die sole basis dlat the Appellant was declared entided to

die absolute ownership of the paddy l;U1d in dispute ;U1d dIUS, die

rights of die tenant cultivators were not reserved by die Final Decree

entered in die partition action;

4. The 7'" Respondent had no jurisdiction to inquire into die complaint

of eviction under die provisions of die Agrarian Development Act

No. 16 of 2000 as he was only obliged to refer die matter to die

Agrari;U1 Tribunal lor the purpose of holding iU1 inquily as required

by section 7 (:1) of die said Act No. 1.6 of 2000.

Grounds of Appeal

1121 At die hearing, die learned President's Counsel for ilie Petitioner

confmed his submission to die following ground of appeal, namely:

l. The leiU-ned High Court.J udge has erred in issuing a writ of

certiorari quashing die decision of ilie 7 Respondent dated

07.09.2007 on die basis dlat die 7 Respondent had no jurisdiction

under die AgriU-iiUl Development Act No. 46 of 2000 to hold iUl

inquiry iUld make a decision when die 7 Respondent had full power

iUld audlOrity under section 6(2) of die Interpretation Ordimmce as

die AgrariiUl Tribunals had not been established upto die time of

die complaint of eviction.

1131 On die odler himd, Dr. Sunil Cooray, ilie learned Counsel for die I"

to 3'd Respondents submitted dial:

I. The r Respondent has failed to consider dlat die AppelliUlt has

admitted in die partition action dlat Nikulas and SayindiU'l who were

niUned as 2'" iUld 3'" DelendiUlts were die teniUlt cultivators of die

paddy liUld in question;

2. The 7 Respondent has made a fund;unental error in dismissing die

complaint of eviction on die ground dlat die AppelliUlt has become

die absolute owner of die paddy liUld in dispute in terms of die Final

1111 This Court is invited by ule p;u'ties to decide ule /ollowing matters:

I. Whether ule 7"' Respondent had Ule auulOrity to hold an inquiry

and decide ule question wheUler or not a ten;ult cultivator has been

evicted under Ule provisions of tJle A6'f;U'i;u1 Development Act No.

Legal grounds for me writ of certiorari

1151 A writ of certiorari will be available whenever any body of persons

having legal authority to detennine questions affecting the rights of subjects

and having a duty to act judicially:

1. acts in excess or absence of their authority; or

2. acts in violation of natural justice; or

3. where there is an error on the face of d1e proceedings.

The authority of the 7- Respondent to hold an inquiry on the complaint of

eviction

1161 At die hearing, Mr. Anil Silva, the learned President's Counsel for d1e

Appellant strenuously argued dlat d1e Agrarian Tribunal had not been

established under d1e Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 at die

time die complaint of eviction was made and hence, d1e 7"' Respondent

could not have forwarded die complaint to the Tribunal. He submitted

dlat in a situation where die mechanism for die resolution of disputes

under die Agrarian Development Act o. 46 of 2000 has not come into

operation by establishing die Agrari,lI1 Tribunals, die repeal of dlat part of

die Agrarian Services Act does not take effect until die Agrarian Tribunals

,u'e established under d1e provisions of d1e Agrari,m Development Act No.

1j.6 of 2000. His contention was dlat section 6 (2) of die Interpretation

Ordin;lI1ce applied ,md dlus, die inquiring officer correcdy held illl inquiry

ill1d decided die matter.

Repeal of Act No. 58 of 1979

1171 The Agr;u'i<U1 Services Act No. 58 of 1979 as ,unended by the

Agr.uiilll Selvices (Amendment) Act 10 4 of 1991 was repealed by

section 99 (I) of die Agrariill1 Development Act o. 46 of 2000. The

Agrarian Development Act No. 4 of 2000 canle into operation on

PIIC-OI06i09 IIC H'\~lIlANTOTA IIC \~ \ 3S12007

18.08.2000. Section 99 (I) or that Act provides 1<:>1" repeal and reads as

lo llows: -

"99 (I) - The Agrarian Services Act No. 5H or 1979 IS hereby

repealed".

Effeet of repeal:

1181 The general elkct or repealing a stal1lte is to obliterate it as completely

Ii-om the records or the P;u-liament ;IS if it had never been passed ;U1el it

must be considered ;L~ a law dlat never existed, except lor the purposes of

those actions which were commenced, prosecuted ;U1d concluded whilst it

was ;U1 existing law (WrIlSOIl 1'. WlilCh (I <) I 6) I KB 6HH & Bindra's

Interpretation of Statutes, 10'" Ed. p. 1529). The general rule of

interpretation dlat is containcd 111 section 6 (I) of die IntcrpretatJon

Ordin,U1ce of Sri LiU1b is as follows:

"'vVhenever iU1Y wntlell law repeahilg eililer IiI whole or piut a fon1ler wntten law i5 ItselF repealed, slich repeal shall 110/, IiI lile absence oFimy expre.I:5 provilion to lilal eilix/, revive or be deem ed to have revived lile repealed wntlen law, or iU1Y light, ollice, pJivliege, matter or lillilg' 1I0tlii force or eXJ:5/ing whell /lie repeallilg'

wnltenlaw com es lillO opera/ioll ':

1191 Thus, die general rule is dlat when an Act of P;U-li;U1lcnt is repealed, in

die absence of allY conl1-aI), intention, it must be considered as if it had

never existed. Since dIe Agrarian Services Act No. 5H of 1979 had been

repealed aIld re-enacted by die AgTaI-ian Development Act No. 16 or 2000,

it is neceSSaI)' to refer to ilie statement of objects at die time of inl1-oducing

the A!"TariaIl Development Act in 2000 in P,u-liaIllent in order to lind out

die legislature's intention in providing lo r such a repeal.

Repealing Act- Statement of purpose of ilie statute

PIIC-OI06109 ll( ll"~IIlM'TOL\ lie \\ ,\ 3"2007

1201 The signiliGUlce of ascertaining the statement of purpose of the

statute in the canon of inteq)retation was succinctly slated by S.K. Das J.. in

tlle Indian Supreme Court case of S. C Prask1r and AllI: 1-: Vasantsen

D waJKadas iwd OI:\'. AIR 1963 SC. 1356, at para 23 as follows:

Repealing Act- Purporsive or functional approach

1221 Statutes are generally constructed, as far as possible, to avoid absurdity

or futility, ,md a statute should be construed in a manner to give it validity

rather tllim invalidity-ut 11:05 J7Ja/fl:s vaJeat quampel1:at (Nandasena v

Selliwilyake (1 98 1) 1 Sri LR 211, 2-1.5). It is settled in the construction of a

statute that "a statute is designed to be workable and tlle interpretation

tllereol' should be to secure tllat o~jec t, unless crucial omission or clear

direction makes tllat end unattainable" (Lord Dunedin in Whitney v

Inland Revenue CommiSSIoner (1 925) AC 27,52). As such, any

construction of a statute which has consequences of rendering tlle

purposeless tlle exercise of autllOrity witlJout jurisdiction, is a nltility

(supra).

PllCOJ06/09 lie IIA \ lBANTOTA lie \VA 3sn007

12al While interpreting a repealing Act, a purposive approach is generally

adopted and the statement of ol~jects and reasons may also be referred to

for Ulal purpose (Thyssell Stahlullioll GmbH Ie Steel AlitilOnly 0/ India

AIR, 1999 SC 3923). In Ule interpretation of a provision of an Act, a

construction Ulat would promote Ule purpose or ol~ject underlying Ule Act,

wheUler Ulat purpose of oQject is expressly stated in Ule Act or not, shall be

preferred to a construction UIat promotes Ulat purpose or ol~ject (OC

Pearce and RS Geddes, Statutor\, Interpretation (Lcxis:"lexis, ~ '" cdn,

201 /1,), pp ,1.1-51, paras 12.71-12.1 /11.

1241 According to Bindra's Interpretation of Statutes 10'" Ed, p. 31[,1, a

statute which confers a benefit on individuals or a class of persons by

relieving Ulem of onerous obligations under contracts entered into by Ulem

or which tend to protect persons against oppressive acts from individuals

wiul whom Uley st;lIId in certain relations is a beneficial le!,rislation.

Alulough a section of a statute has to be interpreted according to its plain

words and wiulout doing \~olence to Ule I;mguage used by Ule legislature,

die beneficial piece of legislation should be interpreted in a purposive

m,U1I1er which would eflectuate Ule oi.Jject of Ule welfare or beneficial

legislation (Nagpllr Dis/n"ct Cell/Tal Co-operative B;lIlK v. State 0/

Makll;1,lil/Ta, 1987 Mall l,J 593).

1251 Thus, a welfare or beneficial legislation such as die A!"T,u'i,m Services

Act or dIe AI,'l';u'i,m Development Act should be interpreted in such a way

that it adv;mces dIe object ;uld die purpose of Ule le!,rislation ,md gives it a

full me,ming ,md eflect, so Ulat Ule ultimate social objective is achieved

( WorKmen of Indian St;lIld;lIr!s 11lSDIlItioll Ie M;lIlagement of 11l(iJ;1Il

PIIC-OI06!09 lie IIA~lIlA1\TOT.\ lie ,\,\ .IS/2007

1261 It is well-settled canon of construction that in construing the provision

of beneficial enactments, the court should adopt that construction which

advances, fulfils and furthers the object of the Act rather tllaIl tlle one

which would defeat tlle same aIld render tlle protection illusory

(CllJillJam;u' KatllJ;m aE1s MlIdlll GOllnder v. Anavoo alias Peliana

GOllnder AlR 1982 SC 137), Thus, a beneficial piece of legislation has to

be construed in its con'ect perspective so as to fructilY tlle legislative intent

underlying it~ enactment (supra), It becomes tlle duty of tlle Court:, tl1llS, to

interpret a provision, especially a welfare or beneficial statutes, by giving it a

wider meaIung ratller tll,m a restrictive one.

1271 An interpretation of a section tllat adVaIICeS tlle object aIld policy of all

Act is more beneficial to tlle ten;mt cultivator and tlle Imdlord, has to be

tl1llS preferred ( Colol"Chem Ltd If All A /aspllrkar & OdJers (1998) 3 SCC

192. The provisions of such all Act CaI1J1ot be interpreted in such a Imumer

as to bring about a result:, so plainly contraI), to tlle object ,md tlle policy of

tlle ie/,rislation, otllelwise tlle intention of tlle legislation would be defeated

(Andbra Hand/oom Weavers' Co-op Society If Stilte olAndbra Pradesh

1281 It is not in dispute tllat tlle complaint of eviction made by tlle present

Respondents was received by tlle 7"' Respondent on 08,05.2007 "P6". The

complaints of eviction received after tlle repeal of tlle Act No. 58 of 1979

and tlle persons who are autllOrized to perfoffil tlle duty of holding such

by die Agr;u-i;ul Development Act No. 46 of 2000 ;Uld tlle new Act GUIle

into operation on 18.08.2000. Section 7 (3) of die A!,'rarian Development

made to the Commissioner-General by a tenant cultivator, the

question whether or not a tenant cultivator has been evicted.

1371 The remedy of the tenant cultivator who complains of eviction is set

<unended by Act No. 46 01'2001 as follows:

1381 It is crystal cle<u' that the scope of the inquiry under section 7 (3) of the

Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended is to decide the question (i) whether or not

the person who made ule complaint is a ten<Ult cultivator; <Uld if so, (ii)

wheuler or not such ten<Ult cultivator has been evicted from ule paddy land

in question in \~olation of ule provisions of ule Ab'T;ui<U1 Development Act

1391 The decision wheuler or nOl not a ten<Ult cultivator has been evicted

from ule paddy land in question has been U1US, confelTed by ule legislature

exclusively on Ule Agrari<U1 Tribunal established under Ule provisions of

ule Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000. An inquiring officer of ule

Agr,u"i<lll Development Act No. ,Hi of 2000.

Saving clause in the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and its

effect on the repeal

1401 Section 99 (2) of the AI,,'T,u"i,m Development Act No. 46 of 2000

however, provides for a saving clause. It contains 8 categories of saving

clauses. A ditlerent rule of interpretation may apply to a case where there is

a saving clause in ,Ul Act for the purposes of those actions or suits which

were conunenced and prosecuted willie the repealed law ' was ,Ul existing

law.

1411 The function of a saving clause is to preserve certajn existing rights,

remedies or privileges ti-OI11 destruct jon (Horack, Cases ,Uld Materials on

Legislation, 2nd Ed. 572) and dlUS, a saving clause is intended to narrow

dle eHect of dIe enactment to which it refers, so as to safeguard die existing

rights or to continue such existing rights from its operation (Francis

Bennion, Statutory Interpreta.tion, 3"' Ed. 358). A saving clause may, thus,

save dle existing right from die operation of die whole of die new Act or a

chapter or P,u1: of dle new act or a particular section or sub-section to

which it is attached (p.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, I" Ed. 20 II,

908).

1421 The Legislature has taken great c;u'e to preserve dle continuity of die

proceedings pending at dle time of repeal eidler before die inquiring

otlicer or Board of Review or Magistrate's Court or <lily oilier Court under

dle provisions of dle Agrari<lll Services Act No. 58 of 1979. The Agrarian

Development Act No. 4,6 of 2000 attaches a saving clause for the purpose

of continuing proceedings conullenced bef()re the inquiring oHicer as at

PIIC-OI06/09 IIC IL\\lnANTOTA IIC \\,\ 351200i

the date of the repeal as the legislature intended to avert certain

consequences and brought the saving clause in section 99 (I) into

operation.

1431 In terms of the saving clause in section 99 (2), the following categories

of proceedings which were pending before the inquiring officer, Board of

Review, Mai,.]strate's Court and other Courts were deemed to be

proceedings instituted under the corresponding provisions of the Agrarian

Development Act and continued ,md concluded. The dlfee saving clauses

relevant to dus case are as follows:

"(2) Notwitilst,llJding tile repeal of tile AgranillJ Selvices Repeal or ct No. 58 of 1 979 ............................. .

PIIClI'06/09 lie IIA \lBANTOTA lie \VA 35/2007

be he;ud aJJd concluded under tlie conesponr/Jilg plVvision oFdlls Act. "

141\1 It is apparent: Ii"om the above mentioned saving clauses, that the said

saving measures were tempor;u), in character ;U1d since the Agrari,U1

Services Act was replaced by the Agr;u"i;U1 Development Act No. 46 of

2000, a saving provision for the aforesaid categories of cases which were

pending at the time of the repeal had to be made. I t is cl),staJ c1e;u" that the

said saving clause as it relates to the above categories or proceedings was

designed to meet the exigencies or the said 3 categories of cases dlat reflect

die intention of the legislatllre that die repeal does not hinder die conduct

of proceedings only pending before die inquiring officer, Bo,u"d of Review,

Magistrate's Court or any odler Court.

Effect of saving clause on repeal-section 6 (3) of tlte Interpretation

Ordinance

1451 The next question is what is die effect of such saving provisions has

been upon repealed provisions after die repeal of die Agrarian Services Act

No. 58 of 1979. Section 6 (3) of die Interpretation Ordinance reads as

follows:

(3) Whenever ,my written law repeals eidler in whole or part, a fOlmer

written law, such repeal shall not, in die absence of any express

provision to iliat ellect, affect or be deemed to have allected-

(a) the past operation of or ;U1ytlting duly done or sutlered under

die repealed written law;

(b) ;my otlice committed, any right, liberty, or penalty acquired or

incurred under die repealed written law;

(c) any action, proceeding, or thing pending or incompleted when

die repealing written law comes into operation, but evel), such

PllC-0106!09 lie ~LUIBA NTOTA IIC \VA 3512007

action, proceeding or thing may be canied on and complained

as if there had been no such repeal.

1461 In tlus section, "proceedings" may include any suit, appeal, review or

revision, application for execution or any other proceeding whatsoever

under the Agrarian Development Act. It seems to me that section 6 (3) of

tile Interpretation Ordinance applies to alI the aforesaid 3 categories of

pending proceedings before tile inquiling officer or tile Board of Review or

tile Magistrate's Court or in any Court at the time of tile repeal. In such

situation, section 6 (3) of tile Interpretation Ordinance will follow wuess a

different intention appears in tile repealing Act. Thus, section 6 (3) of tile

Interpretation Ordinance read with section 99 (I) of tile Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 enables tllOse proceedings to be

continued and concluded under tile corresponding provisions of tile

Agrarian Development Act, UIuess a different intention appears in the

repealing Act.

1471 In tile present case, however, tile complaint of eviction was made on

08.05.2007 and tilliS, no proceeding was pending before tile inquiling

officer wIder tile provisions of tile Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979

when tile Agrarian Development Act canle into operation on 18.08.2000.

Section 6 (3) cannot be applied or invoked in any other proceeding in

respect of which a complaint of eviction had been received after

18.08.2000 as any proceeding in such category was not pending before tile

inquiring officer when tile repealing law (Agrarian Development Act) came

into operation.

Effect of repeal and delay in establishlng Agricultural Tribunals-section 6

(2) of the Interpretation ordinance

1481 Section 6 (2) of tile Interpretation Ordinance reads as follows:

PIIC-0106/09 He IIAMBANTOTA IIC \VA 3512007

"Whenever (U1y wniten law repeals Iii whole orp;ut a /i:Jl7lIer wniten law ;U1d slibslitlies dlereiore some /lew provi5io/l, such repeal ~kJl not tale efltxt unlJ) such subslJtuted IJJvvil'lon comes Ijllo operalJon ':

11.91 The principle behind Section 6 (2) of the Interpretation Ordin,mce is

that ,my provision of the repealed Act would not take eHect ,mel continue

in lorce until the provisions of the substituted provisions of the repealing

Act come into operation as if the Acts had not expired. In d1e present case,

die 7'" Respondent had held an inquil)' dlrough an inquiring olTicer on d1e

purported basis d1at as Agr;u'ain Tribunals were not establisged when die

legislature has clearly auiliorized d1e Agr,u'ain Tribunals to exercise such

audlority.

1501 Now the question is whedler an inquiring oHicer had die audlority to

hold an inquil)' and decide die question whedler or not atenant cultivator

had been evicted when die complaint of eviction had been made alter die

date of the repeal of d1e Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 on die basis

dlat. d1e Ah'Tarian Tribunals had not been established under the provisions

of die Agt'arain Development Act.

1511 Mr. Anil Silva relied on ilie maxim-lex non debet delicere

cO/lqueren/Jbus IiI ./US/Jtl~1 exll/benda, me,uung, dIe law ought not to fail in

dispensing justice to dlOse widl a serious gt'ievance. His argument was dlat:

any person should not suHer a wrong widlOut a remedy (ubi .filS Ibi

remedium) and if a m,m has a right and if he is injured in d1e exercise of

such right, he must, have a remedy to vindicate and maint.un it.

1521 Mr. Silva contended dlat although die legislature has not expressed

provided for such a situation in the Agrarian Development Act, a person

shall be entided to a remedy when Tribunals ,u'e not established and dlUs,

section 6(2) of die Interpretation Ordin;mce was designed to provide a

l'IIC-0106109 11(: IL\MIlANTOTA lie \VA 3512007

remedy for such a situation until Tribwlals are established under the

repealing Act.

1531 As noted, the effect of the savmg clause is onJy to save pending

proceedings before the inquiring ollicer or Board of Review or in any

other Cowl, conmlenced as at the date of the repeal. The saving clause,

however, does not add or enact anything new and all what die saving clause

saves Ii-om is extinction by die repeal is die pending proceedings and rights

and liabilities accmed under die repealed Act, including die clamls for

d;U1lages, assets and liabilities of F;Ulller's Organisations established under

die Act No. 58 of 1979 etc. (See- section 99 (I) -(a) -(d)).

1541 It is manifest dlat die proceedings which were commenced before an

inquiring ollicer before the repeal, but were not concluded by such

inquiling officer were deemed to be proceedings instituted for die purpose

of the cOITesponding provisions of die Agrarian Development Act o. 46

of 2000.

1551 There is anodler reason to ascertain die intention of die legislature in

linliting proceedings to pending inquiring before die inquiring officer

radler dian to entend die audlority to all poceedings until Tribunals are

established. The AgraIian Development Act is also intended to establish

FaImers' OrgaIlization under die provisions of die said Act and the saving

clause in section 99(2)(c) (iii) provides dlat die FaI111erS Orb"Ulisations

District AudlOlity establisged under die AgraliaIl Services Act shall contine

to function until FaIlllerS' OrgaIlisation District AudlOrities aI-e established

under die Act No 46 of 2000. No equivalent provision is found in die Act

No. 46 of 2000 audlOrizing inquiring ollicers to hold inquiries into a

complaint of eviction made after die date of die repeal of the Act No. 58 of

PIIC-0106109 HC IIAMBANTOTA HC WA 3512007

1979 until the Tribunals are established, except lor those proceedings

which were commenced hefore the repeal of the Act No. 16 of 2000.

1561 As noted, the new Agrarian Development Act No 1.6 of 2000 does not

contain express provision that the administrative aUlhorities Gm decide

whether or not the complainant is a tenant cultivator or whether or not a

ten,mt cultivator has been evicted whereas section 28(1) of ule new Act.

expressly provides that Ule administrative auulOrities can decide wheuler a

land is a paddy land or not (judl-,rment of L.T.B. Dehideniya J. in P.H

1581 It is thus clear that section 28 (I) of the Agrarian Development Act

specifically empowers the Conmlissioner to decide any question whether

or not a land is a paddy land whereas the same Act does not contain an

equivalent provision authOlising inquiring officers appointed by the

Commissioner-General to hold inquiries and decide the question whether

or not, a complainant is a tenanct cultivator or whether or not he has been

evicted, except for the limited purposes of those proceedings which were

commenced under ule Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 prior to ule

date of ule repeal.

1591 As regards ule hardship or inconvenience or iqjustice and a want of a

remedy complained of by Mr. Silva due to delays in establishing tJibunals,

I ani of ule view Ulat it is not a reason to violate ule established statutory

provisions intended by Ule legislature. The only criteria ulat a Court must

examine is to ascertain whether Ule enaC011ent is likely to achieve Ule object

sought to be achieved (Javed v. State ofHaIY,lI1a, AIR 2003 SC 3057). It is

well sewed law Ulat h;u"dship or inconvenience of a group of persons

cannot be the ground of deciding ule law as bad (Commissioner of

Ag77c:lIlfllral Income Tax v. Kesllilv Chand, AIR 1950 (sic), ignore a

statutory provision ;md enforce someuling Ulat is contrary to ule intention

of ule legislature.

1601 It is also sewed principle of law Ulat Ule Court would lean in favour of

upholding Ule constitutionality of a statute unless it is manifesuy

discriminatory (Vijay SliJgh And Drs. II. State OF Uttar Pradesh And Drs.

decided on 28 July, 2004, by Ule A1allabad High COllIt,para 82) or

1621 It is evidenl tlla!. h,mlship to an individual cannot be a ground for not

giving elrec! to statutory provisions where Ille legislalure has solely

conferred on tlle AgI<u'i,m Tribunals to peliorm tlle duty or deciding

whetller or not a tenant cultivator has been evicted, except to tllose

proceedings which were instituted and commenced before tlle repeal was

made before 18.08.2000.

IGal The P;u'liament has chosen ;md deliberately confelTcd jurisdiction on

tlle Agr,u-ian Tribunals to decide tlle question whetller or not a ten,mt

cultivator has been evicted under section 7 (a) of tlle Act No . ..j,G or 2000,

except for tlle purposes of tllOse pending proceedings which were

commenced while tlle repealed ACI was ,m existing law.

1611 The decision whetller a complain,mt is a temU1t cultivator or not ,md

whetller or not a ten;U11 cultivator has been evicted is func[;unentally of

jurisdictional import,ulCe ,md tlle issue is in fact, who performs tlle duly.

Thus, ,my decision taken by ,m inquiling oflicer witllOut autllOrity in

respect of a complaint of eviction instituted alter tlle date of tlle repeal,

except for tlle purposes of tllose proceedings which were commenced

PIIC-O 106109 lit II \ 1\1I3ANTOTA lie \y,\ 35/2007

while the earlier act was an existing law, is a mere nullity and without life or

vIgor.

1651 There was a further point which goes to indicate dlat section 6 (2)

could not be applied or alternatively, demonstrates a contrary intention.

There is a dlree-stage process for the resolution of the dispute re!,rarding

complaints of eviction made under dIe Act No. 16 of 2000 as amended by

the Agrarian Development (Amendment) Act No. 46 of 2011. The fIrst

stage is to refer a complaint by dIe Commissioner to dIe Tlibunal directing

it to hold an inquiry by dIe Tribunal dlat consists of eidler a retired judge

widl 7 yeiU's' experience or a retired public officer widl 7 years' experience

at executive level in the field of agrariiUl services. When an appeal is made

to dIe Board of Review, it shall be heard by Members, who shall all be

appointed by dIe Judicial Service Commission. The fmal stage is the appeal

to dIe High Court Court. The process under dIe Act No. 58 of 1979 was a

two-stage process. The first was to refer the complaint to iUl inquiring

officer who is iUl agrariiUl services officer. The second stage is iUl appeal to

dIe Board of Review consisting of Members who were appointed by dIe

Commissioner.

1661 I hold dlat where dlere is a direct conflict between dIe two pieces of

legislation dealing widl a fundiUnental jurisdictional question of who

pelfonns dIe duty of deciding dIe question of eviction except for die

purposes of dlOse actions which were commenced while dIe repealed Act

was iUl existing law.

1671 The legislature has laid down an exhaustive procedure in respect of

dIe form of application, appointment of members of Tribunal iUld BOiU'd

of Review, inquiry procedure, bodl at die inquiry iUld appeal. Bodl

legislations, CiUmot st;uld togedler on dIe question of jurisdiction, niUnely,

PIIC-OI06109 He IIAMBANTOTA lie \VA 35/2007

who perfl)rms the duty under section 7 (:3) and they cannot operate

simuit,meously, except for the limited purposes of diose pending

proceedings which were commenced while die repealed law was an existing

law.

1681 The complaint of eviction in die present case has been made to die 7'''

Respondent on 08.05.2007 and dillS, ;m inquiring oHicer appointed by the

Conunssioner had no audlOrity to hold ;m inquiry and his only function

was to refer such complaint to die Tribunal for the purpose of holding an

inquiry, except lor die purposes of diose proceedings pending before die

inquiring officer at die date of dIe repeal.

1691 The principle behind section 6 (2) will take effect as long as die elleCI

of it is not inconsistent with die intent of die legislation retlected in die

provisions of die Agrarian Development Act widl regard to die

fundamental jurisdictional matters. Section 6 (2) of die Interpretation

Ordinance cannot be applied or be invoked where dlere is a direct contlict

widl the repealing and repealed Act on a fundamental matter of

jurisdiction, munely die question who performs die duty of holding die

inquilY into a complaint of eviction under section 7 (3) of die Agrarain

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended.

1701 The true etTect of section 6 (2) cannot he effected or is not workable

due to a jurisdictional incompatibility ,md application of exhaustive rules

widl regard to die qualifications and appointment of Members to Tribunals

,md die Board 01' Review and die procedure fllr die conduct of inquiries

;md appeals. The invocation of section 6 (2) of the Interpretation

Ordinance under such circul11sGmces would defeat me obvious intention of

1711 The 7- Respondent has held an inquuy through an ulqUirUlg officer

on the question whether or not a tenanct cultivator has been evicted and

decided the matter without audlOrily ill violation of die provisions of the

Agrarain Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as anlended and dlUs, the

detemtination dated 07.09.2007 of dIe 7"1 Respondent marked "P8" is bad

in law and has to be quashed by a writ of certiorwi as correcdy decided by

the learned High COUltJudge.

Error on the face of the determination made by the 7'ni Respondent (P8)

1721 As noted, die complaint of eviction had been dismissed by die 7'''

Respondent, not on die ground of want of jurisdiction, but purely on die

ground dlat in terms of die Final Decree of die partition action in D.C.

Hambantota case bearing No. P/2200, the Appellant has become the

absolute owner of die paddy l,md Ul question and dlUs, the tenant

cultivators had no rights whatsoever, to the paddy land Ul question.

1731 It is not in dispute dlat Sayindara and Nikulas were die tenant

cultivators of die said land called "KaI1abitiyallena" as clearly admitted by

die Appellant in his Plaint dated 21.11.1997 filed Ul die District COUlt of

Hambantot'l. The Appellant while giving evidence ill die partition trial on

20.05.2003 has clearly admitted dlat (i) die tenant cultivators of the said

paddy land were Niculas and Sayindara; (ii) die said Nikulas passed away

and his son is cultivating the paddy land upon his fadler's demise; (iii)

Sayindara who is die other tenant cultivator is also cultivating die said

paddy land. She had sought a partition without affecting die lights of die

said two tenant cultivators (Vide- evidence at page 230 of the brief}.

1741 In temlS of die Final Decree of the partition action, the Apppellant

and the I" Defendant were entided to undivided rights of die said land and

dlereafter, die possession of lot 1 of the Final Partition Paln was delivered

PIIC-OI06/09 IIC UAi\lBANTOTA HC \VA 3512007

to the Appell;mt by the Fiscal 011 26.10.2006 (V I). However, the right~ of

the temmt cultivators ;u-e 1I0t a1fected by the Final Decree of the p;uTitioll

action as the right~ of tenant cultivators ;u-e reserved by 7 (2) of the A/"T<u-i,m

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 ;md conserved by dIe Final P;uTition

Decree. Section 7 (3) of dIe Agrari;m Development Act No. 46 of 2000

reads as follows:

(2) Nofwldlst;UlC/JiJg anytJling Ii} ;Uly odler WJitten law, die tenant cultivator of my extent 0/ paddy land whidi i5 purchased by ;Uly peJ:5on under die Partitioll Law, No. 21 0/1.977, or which is allof/ed

1751 In HL. OriIils v HL. Anddrayas 72 NLR 110, it was held dlat the

interest of a "tenant-cultivator" under dIe Paddy Lmds Act, is ;m

"encumbrance" widlin dIe meaning of Section 48 of dIe ParTition Act

md, dleretore, may properly be specified ,md conserved in a parTition

decree entered in terms of dIal section. Accordingly, dIe judgment was

var-ied, in allotting shares sUQject to dIe rights of dIe defendarl1 as tenarlt-

cultivator.

1761 As noted, dlere is no dispute dlat Nikulas arId Sayindara were die

ten;mt cultivators of dIe paddy land ill question and d1\Js, the Appell;mt had

admitted die relationship between dIe larldlord arId ten;U1t cultivator. The

paddy I;md dispute in question falls widlin dIe scope of the Agrar-iarl

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 ;md dillS, any dispute between dIe tenarlt

''The judgment of dIe Coult of Appeal, finding in lavour of dIe 1st Defendant Respondent, has been based mainly upon dIe jildgment of dIe Supreme COUlt in dIe case of Hendrick Appuhamy vs.JolllJ AppulJamy (supra), where Sallsom; CJ, concludeel, after a consideration of dIe pIvvi5ions of dIe now-repealed Paddy Lands Act No.1 of 1.958, which was dIe ealiiest enactment in dIe sphere of agJicultural Iallds legislation, alld dIe preCUJ:5Or to dIe alorementioned Agralian Services Act No. 58 of 1.97.9 now in force, dlat, as dIe said Paddy Lands Act creates new lights and obligations alJd also proVIdes dIe sole macllJilelY to wllJdl a lalldlOld must resOlt if he wants to have his tenalJt-cu1tivator evicted or his paddy field properly, cultivated, no odler remedy was available to dIe land101d slilce dIe said Act was passed, alld dlat dIe siud Act takes away dIe jillisdiclion of dIe Courts by necessary Implication.

1791 It is absolutely c1e,u- tJlat in tJle present case, tJle District Court had no

power to determine any dispute between tJle tenant cultivator and tJle

landlord and tJUlS, me Final Decree of tJle District COUIt case No. P/2200

never ousted tJle right~ of tJle ten;mt cultivators. The 7" Respondent has

clearly misinterpreted tJle Final Decree of the partition action and litiled to

consider tJlat despite any Final Partition decree, tJle rights of tJle tenant

cultivators are reserved ,md conserved by section 7 (2) of tJle Agr;u-i;ul

Development Act ;uld tJleir rights ;u-e not affected by tJle Final Partition

Decree.

1801 I hold tJlat die rights of tJle ten;mt cultivators of tJle l;uul called

.. Kahabiliyahena" are not extinguished or affected by tJle FinaJ Partition

PIIC-0106109 lie 1I,\MIlANTOTA lie \\A 3512007

Decree and the shares allotted to the Appellant are preserved subject to

the rights of tenant cultivators. Accordingly, the mere delivery of

possession to dIe Appellant by die Fiscal will not extinguish dIe rights of

dIe tenant cultivators of dIe said paddy land.

1811 The 7" Respondent was in error in holding dlat upon dIe entering of

dIe Final Decree in D.C. Hanlbantota Case No. 1'/2200, all rights of tenant

cultivators were extinguished and the Appellant who was allotted lot 1 of

dIe Final Partition Plan in extent of 11 acres and 23.8 perches became dIe

absolute owner and dIe owner cultivator of the said paddy land.

1821 For dlOse reasons, I hold dlat the determination of dIe 7" Respondent

dated 07.08.2007 which contains in "1'8" is erroneous and bad in law and

has to be quashed as correcdy decided by the learned High COUltJudge.

Conclusion

1831 For dlOse reasons, I see no reason to interfere widl dIe judgment of

the learned High Court Judge of Hambantota dated 25.05.2009. The

Appeal is dismissed widl costs.
