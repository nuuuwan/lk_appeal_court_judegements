The Registered owner Petitioner.- Appellant (hereinafter refelTed to as the AppelJant) has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of NOlth Western Province holden in Kuliyapitiya dated 13.09.2018 in Case No. HCR/02/2017 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Learned Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya dated 03.01.2017 in Case No. 14307. Both parties agreed to abide by the written submissions already been filed without going for argument.

The incident in question is summarized as follows

The driver (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused') of the said lorry was charged under sections 24(1)b, 38, 40, 40(A) and 25(2) of the Forest Ordinance as amended, for illegal transport of timber wOlth of Rs.26859.20 by a truck bearing No. NWLK 0773. The Accused, the driver pleaded guilty to the charge leveled against him on 12-01-2016 and the Learned Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs.290001=. Thereafter the Learned Magistrate confiscated the timber and ordered to hand over the same to the State Timber Corporation. The Magistrate held a vehicle confiscation inquiry on the 14th of June 2016 and by way of its order dated 03.01.2017 confiscated the vehicle to which the Appellant claims ownership as its registered owner.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned Magistrate, Magistrate's Court of Kuliyapitiya, the Appellant instituted the said Revision application bearing No:

HCR/02/20 17 in the Provincial High COUlt. The Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High COUlt of Kuliyapitiya delivered his judgement on 13.09.2018

Websit Copy Websit Copy

affirming the said order of the Learned Magistrate of the Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya dated 03.01.2017 and dismissed the Revision Application of the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 13.09.2018 of the Learned Provincial High Court Judge of the North Western Province holden in Kuliyapitiya, the Appellant filed this appeal to this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted following grounds of appeal

in written submissions;

I) The said judgement is contrary to law and to the evidence led in the Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya, in Case No. 14307

2) The Learned Provincial High Court Judge of North Western Province holden in Kuliyapitya, erred in law by not deciding the case of the appellant on balance of probability instead he has appIled the principle of reasonable doubt when confiscating the veh icle in question.

3) The Learned Provincial High Court Judge erred in Law by affirming the order dated 03.01.2017 of The Learned Magistrate of tbe Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya, by not considering tbe fact that the Appellant did not bave any knowledge of tbe commission of tbe said offence, as the Appellant was in Colombo at the commission of tbe said offence and had no control over the said vehicle bearing No. NWLK-0773

4) The Learned Provincial High Court Judge erred in law by interpreting the Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance as amended by the Act No.15 of 2009 and has not considered the fact that the Appellant had no connection whatsoever of the commission of the offence by the Accused.

5) A serious miscalTiage of Justice has been caused to the Appel lant by not granting the alternate relief that has been prayed for in the prayer to the Revision Application bearing No. HCRl02/2017 by not giving an opportunity to commence a fresh inquiry into the said confiscation of the vehicle bearing No. NWLK-0773 so as to establish further that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the offence committed by the Accused.

I wish to consider the grounds of appeal 0 I ,03 and 04 together and analyse in the light of the relevant law to the case.

Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009 states as follows:

''(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest ofJence-(a) a/l timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect o.f which such offence has been committed: and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing such offence. shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such ofJence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles, implements and machines used in the commission of such ofJence, is a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, ,as the case may be, for the commission 0./ the offence. "

The Learned Magistrate has taken the cases The Finance Company PLC. V.

Agampodi Mahapedige Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeal 105A/20081, Umma Habeeba v. OIC, Dehiattakandiya & Other 1999 (3) SLR 89, Manawadu v. OIC, Police Station, Udapussellawa 1997 (2) SLR 30 in to his consideration to decide whether precautionary measures have taken by the Appelant to prevent the commission of the offence. Hence I wish to draw my attention to the above mentioned cases to decide the relevant legal status in relation to the incident.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC Appeall05A12008], it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the said vehicle for tlte commission of the offence. The ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions a/so show that the owner has to establish the said matter on a balance of probability. " (Emphasis added)

Umma Habeeba v. OIC, Dehiattakandiya & Other ]999 (3) SLR 89 states as

follows:

"Provided, however, thaI in any case where the owner of the vehicle is a third party no order of confiscation shall be made if he proves to the satisfaction of the

Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle or that the vehicle Iwd beel/ used without his knowledge for the commission of the offence. ,.

The Learned Magistrate has analysed the testimonies and has arrived at the fo llowing observations.

The Learned Magistrate after analysing the testimonies ofthe registered owner and the accused driver has alTived at the following observation,

Furthermore it should be noted that both the Accused driver and the Appellant were silent about the name of the person who requested the driver to transport a stump of Mahogany. Hence the trustworthiness of the evidence given by the Accused and the Appellant are questionable.

Even though the registered owner has stated that all possible precautionary measures were taken by him in order to prevent the offence, it should be noted that mere instructions would not be sufficient to prove that he took all possible precautionary measures in order to prevent the commission of the offence.

In the landmark case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva CA (PUC) 86/97J, it was held that,

"For these reasons 1 hold that giving mere instructions is not sufficient to discharge the said burden. She n1ust establish that genuine instructions were in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the instructions"

The Learned High Court Judge has held furthermore as follows:

"C~JO~ o tl '1'i35J2Sldt <';ID D)SJOJo~2:5l 8~ 2Sl0lfl gc;mc0'~~ @Di) 6~ 5080'0~

I find that the above observation is correct and reasoning of the Learned High Court Judge is well within the law and indeed hence agree with the same.

Now I wish to consider the 02nd ground of appeal. It has been stated that The Learned Provincial High Court Judge of North Western Province holden in Kuliyapitya, erred in law by not deciding the case of the Appellant on balance of probability, instead he has applied the principle of reasonable doubt when confiscating the vehicle in question.

The Learned Magistrate has observed the following in his judgement in relation to the burden of proof of the case.

The practice of the court is to release the vehicle to the owner if the owner proves on a balance of probability that he was taking precautions to prevent an offence being committed or the offence was committed without his knowledge.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], it was held that,

\ " The Supreme Court has consisiently followed the case of Manawadu Vs the Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for forfeiture is

made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the court that he had taken precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission of the offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. /I

Hence it is evident that it is trite law that the owner should satisfy the court not beyond reasonable doubt, but on balance of probability, that he had taken all the precautionary methods to prevent the commission of the offence. Therefore I am of the view that the conclusion ofthe Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court judge is well within law and the 02 nd ground of appeal should fail.

Now I wish to consider the 051h ground of appeal which states that a serious miscarriage of Justice has been caused to the Appellant by not granting the alternate relief (f) that has been prayed for in the prayer to the Revision Application bearing No. HCRl02/20 17 by not giving an opportunity to commence a fresh inquiry into the said confiscation of the vehicle bearing No. NWLK-0773 so as to establish further that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the offence committed by the Accused.

It is evident that in the above reasoning the osth ground of appeal also fails since there is no any rationale to give any opportunity to commence a fresh inquiry with regard to the said confiscation.

In the above premise the Learned High Court Judge has rightly decided that the Learned Magistrate has acted well within law. Therefore I affinn both orders of the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya dated

03/01117 and 13/09118 respectively.

This Appeal is hereby dismissed.
