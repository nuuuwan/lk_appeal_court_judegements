o I. The Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate's Court of Kaduwela as a suspect for

committing offences punishable under sections 296,113(1),102 of the Penal Code and under

the Fire Arms Ordinance. Upon making an application for bail in the High Court of

Homagama, after inquiry, the learned High Court Judge ordered the Petitioner to be released

on bail on 13.03.2019. The following bail conditions were imposed by the learned High

Court Judge;

I. to deposit a sum of Rs. 700,0001- as cash bail and surety bail in a sum of Rs.3,000,0001-

with two sureties.

2. to report to the Mirihana Special Crimes Bureau on the specified Sundays.

3. not to interfere or harass the prosecution witnesses in any manner.

02. On 02.09.2019, the Petitioner made an application to get the amount ordered as cash bail

reduced on the basis that he could not afford the amount of Rs. 700,0001-. The learned High

Court Judge refused the application. The reason given for the refusal by the learned High

Court Judge was that the Petitioner had previous convictions, and also, he had taken into

consideration the nature of the pending cases the Petitioner had. The instant application is to

get the above order of the learned High Court Judge revised and get an order reducing the

amount of cash bail.

2

03. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the cash bail amount ordered

by the learned High Court Judge was excessive and that he had continued to be in remand as

he was unable to deposit the cash bail ordered.

04. Learned State counsel objecting to the application submitted that the order of the learned

High Court Judge was not illegal or arbitrary and that it was justified when considering the

conduct of the Petitioner in pending cases.

OS. On perusal of the High Court proceedings dated 13.03.2019, it is observed that the learned

State counsel who appeared for the Respondent State had submitted that State had no

objection to the granting of bail to the Petitioner on strict conditions considering the period he

had been in remand as at that date. Learned State counsel also mentioned to Court about all

the pending cases and their nature.

06. Although there was no submission to the learned High Court Judge about any previous

convictions as at that date, on 02.09.2019, learned High Court Judge in his order said that he

considered the previous convictions as well when he refused to reduce the quantum of cash

bail.

07. It is settled law that the quantum of bail should not be excessive. Section II of the Bail Act

provides;

"(1) Where any court is required to determine the amount of a bond to be

executed, the sum of money to he deposited or the certified bail to be furnished by

any person under paragraph (c) (d) or (e) of subsection (I) of section 7 as the

case may be it shall do so with due regard to the nature of the offence the sUJpect

or accused is alleged to have committed, and the punishment specified therefore

by law, and to the means of such suspect or accused and the amount so

determined shall not be excessive.

(2) Where a suspect or accused has not been released on the ground that a bond for

the amount determined by court has not been executed whether by himself or by a

.r--------------------------------------------------,

surety or that the sum of money required to be deposited has not been deposited

or that the certified bail required to be furnished has not been furnished, the

court may at any time while he is in custody, reduce the amount so determined. "

08. In case of Sumit Mehta V. Stale of N. C. T. of Delhi Criminal Appeal No. 1436 of 2013

[13. 09. 2013J, Supreme Court of India said;

"The words "any condition" used in the provision should not be regarded as

conferring absolute power on a Court of law to impose any condition that it chooses

to impose. Any condition has to be interpreted as a reasonable condition acceptable

in the facts permissible in the circumstance and effective in the pragmatic sense and

should not defeat the order of grant of bail. We are of the view that the present facts

and circumstances of the case do not warrant such extreme condition to be imposed. "

It is clear that a condition which a suspect cannot fulfill or reach, which would defeat the

order of granting bail should not be imposed by a Court.

09. In the instant case the Petitioner had made the application to get the quantum of cash bail

ordered reduced more than five months after the bail order was made on 13.03.2019. As I

stated earlier at paragraph 05, on 13.03.2019, the learned State counsel consented to bail

being granted considering the long period in remand. Hence, I am of the view that the learned

High Court Judge should have considered reducing the quantum of cash bail previously

ordered.

4

r---------------------------------------------------------~

10. Hence, I order that the quantum of cash bail to be reduced to Rs.400,OOO/- instead of

Rs.700,OOO/-. The rest of the bail conditions imposed by the High Court should remain

unchanged.

Revision application is allowed to the above extent.
