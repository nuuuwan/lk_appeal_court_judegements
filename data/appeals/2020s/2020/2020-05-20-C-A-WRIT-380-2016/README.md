Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Boopathi Kahathuduwa for the Petitioner.

Maithree Amarasinghe, S.C., for the

Respondents.

Argued on: 19.02.2020

Decided on: 19.05.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner who was in the rank of (Acting) Major in the Sri

Lanka Army became totally blind, according to the findings of

the Army Medical Board marked P6, Due to antimalarial tablets

taken as a treatment or prophylaxis when deployed in North and

East. This was categorised as a permanent disability

compelling him to retire from the Army.

The Petitioner claimed compensation in terms of Public

Administration Circular No.22/93 (iv) dated 29.12.2008 marked

P9, the applicability of which was extended to members of the

Armed Forces by P10. The P9 Circular would apply inter alia if

the injury is caused by an accident whilst on duty. There is no

issue that the injury was caused whilst the Petitioner was on

duty in operational areas. The 1st Respondent Commander of

the Army, as seen from P12-P14, refused compensation on the

basis that the Petitioners blindness did not occur due to an

accident.

Blacks Law Dictionary (8th edition) defines the word accident

as An unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence;

something that does not occur in the usual course of events or that

could not be reasonably anticipated...An unforeseen and injurious

occurrence not attributable to mistake, negligence, neglect or

misconduct.

The Philippine Law Dictionary (3rd edition) defines the term as

that which happens by chance or fortuitously, without intention

and design, and which is unexpected, unusual and unforeseen.1

The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (9th edition) defines

accident as inter alia something that happens unexpectedly

and is not planned in advance.

At the argument, learned State Counsel generously accepted

that the word accident can encapsulate both an instantaneous

occurrence and a prolonged process. A motor traffic accident

falls into the former category whereas the case of the Petitioner

falls into the latter.

It is clear that the interpretation given to the word accident

appearing in the Circular marked P9 by the Commander of the

Army is inaccurate and the decision not to make payment of

compensation on P9 based on that interpretation is therefore

incorrect.

At the argument, learned State Counsel candidly admitted that

the Petitioners injury falls within the definition of accident.

Had this admission been made on the notice returnable date,

the relief sought by the Petitioner regarding compensation could

have been granted.

The Petitioner has continued to fight for his rights, as he did on

the battlefield for the greater good of the motherland. It

appears, as a result, a new Court of Inquiry was convened to

look into the Petitioners grievance after the institution of the

actionvide X1-X3 tendered with the counter affidavit.

Thereafter, as seen from X4 dated 14.08.2018 and X5 dated

18.10.2018, the Commander of the Army and the new Medical

Board, respectively, recommended that compensation be paid to

the Petitioner in terms of Circular No.22/93 (iv) dated

29.12.2008 marked P9.

According to this new development, the reliefs prayed for in

paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition have become

superfluous. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed the

Court at the argument that he also does not pursue the reliefs

prayed for in paragraphs (d), (f) and (g) of the prayer to the

petition.

The only relief which the Petitioner now seeks is paragraph (e) of

the prayer to the petition, which is payment of compensation in

terms of Circular No.22/93 (iv) dated 29.12.2008 marked P9,

extended by P10.

In view of recent developments, as reflected in the documents

marked X1-X5, this relief can be granted.

However, learned State Counsel for the Respondents has a

qualm. State Counsel says that due to the Cabinet decision

5

dated 28.03.2018 marked R5 and the follow-up Circular of the

Ministry of Defence dated 05.04.2018, whereby a new scheme

was introduced to pay compensation to members of the Armed

Forces, Circular No.22/93 (iv) dated 29.12.2008 marked P9

cannot be made use of to pay compensation to the Petitioner.

The new Circular dated 05.04.2018 is not part of the record, but

learned State Counsel tendered a copy in open Court. This

Circular seems not to be as favourable to the Petitioner as the

old Circular marked P9.

Learned State Counsel admits that the old Circular has not been

annulled by the new Circular. Both Circulars are in operation in

parallel. But Counsels point is that when a new Circular is

issued in order to deal with a particular category of members of

the Armed Forces, into which, according to Counsel, the

Petitioner falls, it is not permissible for the Petitioner to rely on

the old Circular. This argument is unsustainable.

In the first place, the new Circular has no retrospective effect.

Nor has it cancelled the old Circular. Therefore, the authorities

had the option of selecting the most relevant and applicable

Circular in deciding the Petitioners application. When the

Commander of the Army and the new Medical Board by X4 and

X5 decided that the Petitioner comes within the old Circular

marked P9, they were aware of the existence of both Circulars

but took a considered decision to grant relief to the Petitioner in

terms of the old Circular. The decision reflected in X4 and X5 is

not challenged in these proceedings or in any other.

When a statute can be interpreted in favour of either the subject

or the State, the tendency is to interpret it in favour of the

former, for it is the fundamental obligation of the State to protect

the interests of citizens, for the benefit of whom alone it exists.

There is a presumption that the legislature does not intend what

is unreasonable and unjustifiable.

Bindras Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition) at page 225

states Where an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a

reasonable doubt as regards its meaning, the benefit of doubt

must be given to the subject and against the legislature which

failed to explain itself.

Wade in his monumental work Administrative Law (11th Edition)

at 735-736, whilst discussing the legal form and characteristics

of Circulars, states that although Circulars have no inherent

legal effect, they may be used as a vehicle for conveying

instructions to which some statute gives legal forceThey may

also contain legal advice of which the courts will take notice.

Our Courts have recognised that Circulars are amenable to writ

jurisdiction. Vide The Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka v. The

Surveyor General [1994] 2 Sri LR 319; Pathirana v. Victor Perera

[2006] 2 Sri LR 281.

Hence, one may argue that the principles of interpreting

subordinate legislation are applicable in giving effect to

Circulars. In this regard, Bindra in the said treatise at page 100

states The courts should take a cautious approach in construing

the subordinate legislation and adopt almost the same standard

as adhered to in interpreting legislative enactments.

It is well settled law that the rights of parties shall be decided at

the date of the institution of the action. (Talagune v. De Livera

[1997] 1 Sri LR 253 at 255; Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister

of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248;

Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank [1998] 3 Sri LR 197 at 198;

Abayadeera v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor,

University of Colombo [1983] 2 Sri LR 267 at 280; Kalamazoo

Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour & Vocational Training [1998] 1

Sri LR 235 at 248)

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner drew the attention of the

Court to Bindra at page 508 where the learned author states

When the law is altered during the pendency of an action, the

rights of the parties are decided according to law, as it existed

when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear

intention to vary such rights.

Bindra also states at page 510:

A statute will not affect rights which had accrued before a

statute came into force unless there are express words in

the statute affecting such rights or where a retrospective

effect to the statute is inevitable by necessary intendment

or implication. Statutes should be interpreted, if possible, so

as to respect vested rights. It is not to be presumed that

interference with existing rights is intended by the

legislature, and if a statute be ambiguous the court should

lean to the interpretation which would support existing

rights.

Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th edition) at 220-221

echoes the above sentiments, citing the United Kingdom case of

National Real Estate and Finance Co., Ltd v. Hassan [1939] 2 KB

61, where the Court of Appeal held that a landlord who had filed

an action by way of writ prior to the enactment of legislation

applicable to the said action, was allowed to proceed with the

action in terms of the law at the time of filing the application.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner also invited the Court to look

at the issue from another perspective. He referred to the

following observations made by S.N. Silva J. (later C.J.) in

Ibrahim Rahumathuma v. Peoples Bank [1993] 2 Sri LR 387 at

399:

The 3rd Respondent made her application to the Bank on

10-07-1979, nearly five years before the amendment of

1984 had come into force. This delay, enabled the Petitioner

to raise the objection of time bar. If the application had been

processed expeditiously, a decision to acquire may have

been made prior to the amendment coming into force. In

these circumstances, it would surely be an injustice, to

strike down the application of the 3rd Respondent on the

basis of a new factor in the form of an amendment, which

came into force during the period of delay, for which the 3rd

Respondent was not responsible. On the other hand, if

there was another applicant, who was similarly

circumstanced as the 3rd Respondent but whose application

was expeditiously processed and a decision made to

acquire prior to the amendment; would not such an

applicant have an undue advantage over the 3rd

9

Respondent? In my view law should be interpreted so that

its application will avoid such injustice and discriminatory

treatment amongst persons, similarly circumstanced. These

matters too, weigh against the interpretation contended for

by learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner.

I am in total agreement with these observations. In the instant

case, the Petitioner filed this application on 04.11.2016 and the

new Circular was issued nearly one and a half years later, i.e. on

05.04.2018. If the application of the Petitioner had been

processed expeditiously, he would have been entitled to the relief

sought without contest from the State.

For the aforesaid reasons, I grant the relief prayed for in

paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition and allow the

application of the Petitioner but without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
