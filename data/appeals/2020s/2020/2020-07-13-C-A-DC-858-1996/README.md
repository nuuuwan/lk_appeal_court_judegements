N.Bandula Karunatathna J.

The Plaintiff Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) preferred this Appeal

praying inter alia to set aside the judgement dated 15th November 1995 of the District

Court of Kegalle and a Judgment be entered in favour of the Plaintiff and 1st to 7th

Defendants to a half share, and the 18th and 19th Defendant to balance half share.

On 18th November 1977, the Plaintiff had instituted the above styled partition action

bearing No 2191O/P in the District Court of Kegalle to partition the land more fully

described in the schedule of the plaint.

According to the Plaintiff's evidence, the original owner of the land was one Mudalihami

and then one Mudiyanse, Punchi Appuhamy, Ukku Banda, Kapuru Banda and finally the

Plaintiff the Plaintiff and 7 others own one third (1/ 3) of the subject matter. Having

completed the pleadings, as directed by the Courts, Preliminary Survey had been carried

out by S. Abeysiriwardena, Licensed Surveyor and on 15th May 1980 and he submitted his

Preliminary Plan No. 457 and his report which are marked as X.

The trial commenced on 220d August 1989 and on 16th August 1990 the Plaintiff by

adducing her evidence marked Deeds P-1 to P-3. However, by adducing her evidence on

17 March 1993 the Plaintiff stated that her husband was in possession of the corpus and

the 18th and 19th Respondent occupied the house even at that time. On 31st January 1994

the 18th Defendant by adducing his evidence marked the Plan No 457(X) and two Deeds

and claimed the ownership for the entire corpus.

The Gramasewaka of the area and a Timber Merchant were also called to give evidence in

support of the 18th Defendant and 19th Defendant. On 15th November 1995 the Learned

District Judge of District Court, Kegalle delivered his judgment dismissing the plaint of the

Plaintiff with costs and held that the 18th and 19th Defendants have the prescriptive rights

for the land as they are in undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the said land for a

longer period of time. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Plaintiff preferred this

Appeal to the Court of Appeal only against the 18th and the 19th Defendants.

Counsel for the 18th and 19th Defendant Respondents raised a Preliminary Objection

regarding the maintainability of this appeal. After considering submissions by both parties,

court decided to dismiss this appeal on the 18.06.2014.

Page 3 of 9

The said decision was challenged by the Substituted Plaintiff- Appellant- Petitioner in the

Supreme Court and it was decided on the 19.01.2016, to refer the Appeal back to the Court

of Appeal to decide it on merit. Accordingly, the Supreme Court vacated the Court of

Appeal order dated 18.06.2014.

Thereafter the case was fixed for argument before this court on the 02.09.2019. On that

day both parties agreed to disposed of this matter by way of written submissions. Parties

were allowed to file written submissions.

The Plaintiff claims that in this partition action, the contest was between the Plaintiff and

the 18th and 19th Defendant Respondents.Jhe name of the land is Keenagahahena and it

is shown in Plan 457 dated 01.05.1980 as lots 1 and 2. According to the pedigree submitted

by the Plaintiff the original owner was Mudalihamy. The Plaintiff produced large number

of deeds to show the devolution of title. The Plaintiff states that the land is called as

Palleakeenagaha hena shown in plan 457, whereas the 18-19 Defendants position was

that, the corpus is called Borellawatta. According to the Plaintiff the original owner was

Mudalihamy and title has flown from him.

The Plaintiff pleaded that, one Mudalihamy was that owner of the land shown in Plan 457T

as opposed to the 18th and 19th Defendants who claimed that the original owner was

Kapuru Banda and on his death property devolved on 8,11-17 Defendants.

In this case, it is necessary to analyze whether the 18th and 19th Defendants have the

prescriptive rights for the land as they claim to be in undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession of the said land for a longer period of time.

In MaduanwalaVs Ekneligoda3 NLR213; the term possession and occupation was distinguished,

a person may occupy without posseSSion, and a person may possess without occupation.

It was decided in De Mel Vs Amarasinghe 40 NLR 455; an action for use an occupation does

not lie against a person who was given possession of a land in pursuance of an agreement

to purchase the land which not completed, though no default on his part.

The characteristic of "possession" as distinguished from "occupation" was that the former

implied the element of holding or tenure Ut dominus. The Fact in the case was that the

owner's sister was allowed to live in his house as an act of charity, she was provided with

clothing and shelter, but she did not gain possession and most of the house was utilized by

the owner and he also used for his official work. It was held that the prescriptive title has

not been established. A person who is let into occupation of property as a licensee must

be deemed to continue to occupy on the same footing. Therefore, in order to prove

possession there must be some overt act which manifest his intention to occupying.

Page4of9

The concept of Adverse Title or Independent Title in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance is that the possession on which the prescriptive title is based on must be 'by a

title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action'.

In CoorayVs. Perera 45 NLR455; the concept of adverse possession was explained;

'Where a person obtains a transfer of the entirety of a property from a co-owner, his possession is that of

a co-owner, and it does not become adverse without proof of ouster or something equivalent to ouster.

There must be a corporeal occupation of land attended with a manifest intention to hold & continue it.

It is the intention to claim title against all other persons which makes the possession of the

holder of the land adverse."

Therefore, there is a necessity to assess whether adverse possession is prevalent in order

to establish prescription. The Defendants claim that they prescribed the said land and have

led the evidence of one Ekanayake, a Grama Niladhari to support their claim. The 18th and

19th Defendants state that having called a 70 years old Timber Merchant, who had sold

timber for his house, which was constructed in the year 1960 and having cal led the

aforesaid Gramasewaka, they had proved his prescriptive title since 1960s for the land.

According to the Plaintiff, the Grama Sewaka stated that he was the Waga Niladhari, during

the period 1978 - 1989 but was not able to produce any documentary proof regarding

payment of Acreage Taxes. The Plaintiff claims that if the witness is an official witness his

evidence must be corroborated by official letters or Receipts, given in respect of the

corpus. Furthermore, when his evidence is challenged and contested, one expects the

official witness, to produce documentary evidence, to assist what he states. In this

situation, there was no such evidence.

The Plaintiff questions the credibility of the next witness as well. He was one Karunarathne

who stated that in 1960, that Defendant purchased Timber from him seeking to show that,

the house was built with the timber purchased by him. The Plaintiff submitted that there

is no proof to say that, the timber purchased was for this particular House. In his Evidence,

he had stated that, he does not know the extent of the corpus. Incidentally he was giving

Evidence of a purchase, which happened 25 years ago.

In Theivanda ran vs Ramananda Chettiar 1986 (2) SLR 219; Supreme Court held that, when

the legal title to the premises is proved to be in the Plaintiff, the burden of proof is on the

Defendant to show that he is in lawful possession. Therefore, in the instant case, the

burden of proof is on the Defendants to establish that they are in lawful possession.

Page 5 of9

In this case it has been clearly established that the house is in the possessions of the 18th

and 19th Defendants and they reside in the corpus since 1960s. The evidence given by the

18th Defendant was confirmed by the Gramasevaka of the area and the Timber Merchant

who supplied timber for their house construction. The Gramasevaka in his evidence has

clearly stated that no one else was in the possession of the house other than the

Defendants.

Since the 18th Defendant had proved that the house was in their possession since 1960's,

it could be considered that the 18th Defendant had established his undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession for a long period. But they have not proved the possession of

the plantation, which they claimed before the Surveyor, on the 10th and 11th August 1979.

Merely claiming before the Surveyor is not enough to prove that the 17th, 18th, and 19th

Defendants were enjoying the disputed plantation. There should be some independent

evidence to confirm that situation.

Having analyzed the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff, the Learned Judge has come to the

conclusion that the 18th and 19th Defendants were in possession and they had a longer

possession at the time she received the deed No. 931, attested by A.T.R. Goonarathne,

Notary Public, from her farther Ukku Banda.

On perusal of cases and authorities on prescription of land, in Leisa and Another v. Simon

and Another 2002(1) SLR 148; the Court of Appeal has quoted from Principles of South

African Law written by Wille as follows:

Wille in his book "Principles of South African Low" (3,d edition) at page 190

states as follows:

"Paper title plus prescription must have been proved when the absolute owner at the thing has the following rights in the things":

(1) to possess it;

(2) to use and enjoy it;

(3) to destroy; it

(4) to alienate it. "

In Subramaniyam V. Siva raja 46 NLR 540; it was held if one enters and takes the

profit exclusively and continuously for a very long period under circumstances

which indicate a denial of a right in any other co-tenant to receive them as by not

accounting with the acquiesces of the other co-tenant, as ouster may be proved.

In Karunawathie & two others V Gunadasa, 1996 (2) SLR 406, it was held that in

considering whether or not a presumption of ouster should be drawn by reason of

Page 6 of9

long continued possession alone of the property owned in common, it is relevant

to consider,

The income derived from the property; The value of the property;

The relationship of the co-owners and where they reside in relation to the situation of the corpus.

In D.R. Kiriamma V.J.A. Podibanda and 8 others (unreported case) our Supreme

Court has held that:

a) proof of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a Defendant-

Respondent to any action or by those under whom he claimed such land

or immovable property by a title adverse and independent to that of

the Claimant or Plaintiff for 10 years previous to bringing of the action

is entitled to a decree in his favour.

b) Possession therefore need to be unaccompanied by payment of rent or

performance of service or duty or by any other act by the possessor for

which acknowledgment of a right excising in another person would

fairly and naturally be inferred.

c) Omus Probendi or the burden of proving possession is on the party

calming prescriptive possession. Importantly prescription is a question

of fact. Physical possession is a Factum Probandum. Considerable

circumspection is necessary to recognize prescriptive title as

undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party having paper title.

Title by prescription is an illegality made legal due to the other party not

taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title is

required to be by a title adverse to an independent, that of a Claimant

or Plaintiff.

In Lesin V Karunaratne 61 NLR 38; it was held that where a person donates immovable

property reserving to himself a life interest prescription does not begin to run against the

done until the death of the donor. In such a case, the done, as remainder-man, is entitled

to the benefit of the proviso to section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance and adverse

possession against the donor cannot be counted against the donee.

However, it is pertinent to note that although the Defendants in fact possessed the land

and thereby prescribed to the same, the Defendant did not lead Evidence as to how they

Page 7 of 9

possessed the entire land. Th e Plaintiff submits that possessing and occupying a house on

the land would not entitle a Defendant to say, that, he has prescribed to t he entire land

when that extent is over one Acre.

Moreover, it is also important to note that the position of the Defendant is that he has

prescribed to land. When considering Plan 457 X, it is a land in extent of A. 1-R. 2-P. 92,

even among that the Defendants were prescribed to the House. Therefore, the question

arises as to whether there is any Evidence to prove that, the Defendant however

prescribed to the entire extent of the land. How did he possess the entire land? This

question does not seem to be sufficiently answered by the 18th and 19th Defendants.

I fu rther note that even if there is cogent evidence to support that the Defendants had

possessed the house, there is no proof that he possessed the entire Land. It is my

observation that the witness summoned also refer only to the house as opposed to the

entire extent of the land.

The 18th defendant under cross examination on 31st January 1984 had stated.

9 - 2Sl,Cl Y, 00'llEl2S! ~25l'25), goCl6,CCl 2SlEl15J' y, 00'llEl2S! ~5El25)El, @25l'~? t5 Y, 00'llEl

Thus the 18th defendant conceded a half share of the land to t he plaintiff and the 1 to 7

defendants.

In view of the law and the facts stated above, the 18th and 19th Defendants had proved

prescriptive possession to a certain extent. However, possessing and occupying a house on

the land would not entitle a Defendant to say, that, he has prescribed to the entire land.

Therefore, considering the aforementioned law and facts, the appeal shall be allowed.

Page 8 of 9

I decide that the said land should be owned in the followi ng proportions;

(a) Y, sha re of the land to be a lIocated to the Plaintiff and 1st to 7 th Defenda nts

(b) the balance Y, share should be allocated to the 18th and 19th Defendants.

For the reasons stated in this judgement, I set aside the judgement of the learned District

Judge of Kegalle, dated 15.11.1995 and allow th is appeal. The Plaintiff is entit led for cost

in the District Court as well as in the Court of Appea l.
