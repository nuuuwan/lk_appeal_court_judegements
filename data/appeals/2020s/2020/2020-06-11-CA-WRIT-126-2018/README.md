Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Pasindu Silva with Ms. Kaushali Jayaweera for the Petitioner Susantha Balapatabendi, P.C., Additional Solicitor General with Ms. Indumini Randeny, State Counsel for the Respondents Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 31st January 2019, 4th June 2019 and 28th January 2020 Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 4th June 2019 and 25th February 2020 Decided on: 9th June 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was mentioned on 31st May 2019, the learned Counsel

appearing for the parties informed this Court that they are in agreement to this

Court delivering its judgment on the written submissions of the parties. Having

considered the written submissions, this Court invited the learned Counsel to

provide this Court with their written response to seven questions posed by this

Court, which was duly complied with, by way of further written submissions.

The primary issue that arises in this application is whether the decision of the

Respondents that the Petitioner does not meet the stipulated criteria for

appointment to the rank of Brigadier, is illegal, irrational and/or arbitrary.

The Petitioner had joined the Sri Lanka Army as an Officer Cadet in 1986, and

had been commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1989. The Petitioner states

4

that he received his promotions in the regular course, and was promoted to

the rank of Colonel on 23rd December 2013. Upon completion of three years in

the rank of Colonel i.e. on 23rd December 2016 - the Petitioner was eligible to

be considered for promotion to the rank of Brigadier. It is admitted between

the parties that the maximum period that the Petitioner could serve in the

rank of Colonel is five years.1 Thus, if the Petitioner is not promoted to the rank

of Brigadier during that five year period, and unless the Petitioner is given an

extension of service in the rank of Colonel, the Petitioner was required to

retire from the Sri Lanka Army on 23rd December 2018.

The Petitioner has produced with the petition marked P17, Army Routine

Order No. 32/2013 issued by the 1st Respondent, Commander, Sri Lanka Army.

P17 provides for the appointment of an Advisory Board, comprising of the

Chief of Staff as its Chairman and seven or more Senior Officers of the Sri Lanka

Army. The function of the Advisory Board is to advice and make

recommendations to the Commander of the Army in respect of any matter

that the Commander may direct. P17 also provides for: (a) the appointment

of the Army Selection Board No. 1 to advise and make recommendations to the

Commander in respect of the selection and promotion of Officers to the rank

of Major General; and (b) the Army Selection Board No. 2 to advise and make

recommendations to the Commander in respect of the selection and

promotion of Officers to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel and Brigadier.

According to the Petitioner, the procedure followed when considering the

promotion of an Officer to the rank of Brigadier is as set out below:

1 Vide Regulation 3(1)(b) of the Army Pensions and Gratuities Code 1981, published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 562/11 dated 15th June 1989, marked R6.

5

a) The Military Secretary shall call for the recommendation of the Colonel of

the Regiment to which the Officer belongs;

b) The Military Secretary shall call for the recommendation of the General

Officer Commanding, of the Division to which the Officer is attached;

c) The Military Secretary shall call from the Director of Training, the Physical

Efficiency Test of the Officer;

d) The Army Selection Board No.2 shall consider the above

recommendations and submit its decision to the Commander, Sri Lanka

Army;

e) The Commander, Sri Lanka Army shall submit his recommendation to HE

the President, through the Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The Respondents, while not disputing the above procedure, has drawn the

attention of this Court to two matters. The first is to Regulation 12 of the Army

Officers Service Regulations (Regular Force) 1992, published in Gazette

Extraordinary No. 780/7 dated 17th August 1993, produced by the Respondents

marked R1, which contain provisions inter alia with regard to the promotion

of Officers to the rank of Colonel and above.

Regulation 12 reads as follows:

(1) Promotion to the rank of Colonel and above shall be by selection. In

the case of promotion to the rank of Colonel, such promotion shall be

given only to such substantive Lieutenant Colonel as is considered best

6

qualified for such rank and appointment. In the case of promotion to the

rank of Brigadier, such promotion shall be given only to such substantive

Colonel as is considered best qualified for such rank and appointment.

(2) In the case of every such selection

(a) The Officers past record of service; and

(b) The question whether his promotion is clearly in the best interest of

the Army

shall be considered.

The second matter on which the attention of this Court has been drawn to is

the fact that the Army Selection Board No. 2 is not bound by the

aforementioned recommendations, and arrives at its decision having taken

into consideration all relevant matters relating to the Officer concerned.

The decision to promote an Officer to the rank of Brigadier must therefore be

taken by the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, on the recommendation of

the Army Selection Board No. 2, who shall take into consideration inter alia the

aforementioned recommendations. This Court is therefore in agreement with

the learned Additional Solicitor General that appointment to the rank of

Colonel or Brigadier is not as of right, but is at the discretion of the Army

Selection Board No. 2 and the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army. The

discretion vested in the Army Selection Board No. 2 and the Commander,

needless to state, shall be exercised reasonably, taking into consideration the

aforementioned recommendations, and the criteria set out in Regulation 12 of

R1, which criteria can be summarised as follows.

7

a) The Officer must be considered the best qualified for such rank and

appointment;

b) The Officer must have a good past record of service; and

c) An Officers promotion must clearly be in the best interest of the Army.

This Court must state that it will not interfere with the finding of the Army

Selection Board No.2 and the Commander, Sri Lanka Army that an Officer is not

qualified for promotion to the rank of Brigadier or that his promotion is not in

the best interest of the Army, except where this Court is satisfied that:

(a) The discretion vested in the Army Selection Board No.2 and/or the

Commander, Sri Lanka Army has been exercised unreasonably or

wrongfully;

(b) The decision to deny an Officer his promotion is illegal, arbitrary,

irrational or unreasonable;

(c) There has not been a proper consideration of the material pertaining to

the Officer, or irrelevant matters have been taken into consideration.

In other words, as long as due process has been followed, the Officer has been

afforded a fair hearing, the decision of the Army Selection Board No. 2 and/or

the Commander is legal, rationale and reasonable, and, importantly, material

to substantiate the said decision has been presented to this Court, this Court

shall not interfere with the decision of the Army Selection Board No.2 and/or

the Commander, Sri Lanka Army.

8

The following passage of Justice Sripavan (as he then was) in Wikramaratne vs

Commander of the Army and others2, sets out clearly the role of this Court

when considering issues relating to the non-promotion of Officers within the

Armed Forces:

in service matters, the 1st Respondent should be left with a free hand to

make decisions with regard to the internal administration of the Army in

the interest of efficiency, discipline, exigencies of service etc. The Court

cannot interfere with the appointment or promotion unless the first

respondent has acted unlawfully, arbitrarily, or guided by ulterior

considerations which are discriminatory or unfair.

This Court shall now consider the facts of this application very briefly.

It is not disputed that the Petitioner was confirmed in the rank of Colonel on

23rd December 2013. With the criteria to be promoted to the rank of Colonel

being identical to the criteria applicable when considering promotion to the

rank of Brigadier, it can safely be concluded that as at 23rd December 2013,

the Commander, Sri Lanka Army was satisfied of the following:

a) The Petitioner was considered the best qualified for the rank and

appointment of Colonel;

b) The Petitioner had a good past record of service;

2 CA (Writ) Application No. 800/2006 CA Minutes of 07th January 2008.

9

c) The Petitioners promotion to the rank of Colonel was in the best interest

of the Army.

As noted earlier, the Petitioner was eligible to be considered for promotion to

the rank of Brigadier after 23rd December 2016. The Petitioner states that the

Army Selection Board No.2 that met on 30th May 2017 had considered him for

promotion to the rank of Brigadier, but had not recommended him for

promotion as there was an inquiry pending against the Petitioner.3 The

Respondents have not provided this Court with the decision of the Army

Selection Board No. 2 that met on 30th May 2017 but has agreed with the

Petitioner that the Petitioner was not promoted to the rank of Brigadier due to

the pending inquiry.4 The inquiry that was referred to by the Army Selection

Board No. 2 is where on 7th June 2016, some fallen trees had been cut by

soldiers working under the Petitioner and the timber had been used to repair

the official chalet of the Petitioner, who at that time was the Brigade

Commander in Oddusudan. Pursuant to a Court of Inquiry, the Commander, Sri

Lanka Army had arrived at the following conclusion on 26th October 2017:

It is therefore clear that the Petitioner has been issued with only a warning

because the Commander, Sri Lanka Army was satisfied that the Petitioner had

not acted dishonestly or for his personal benefit, as the repairs had been

carried out on the official chalet of the Brigade Commander.

The Petitioner states that responding to a request by the Military Secretary

dated 31st October 2017, the GOC 58th Division had submitted a report dated

10th November 2017, annexed to the petition marked P5 recommending the

Petitioners promotion to the rank of Brigadier. This Court has examined P5

and observes that the Petitioner has been awarded full marks for integrity,

which is a mandatory requirement if an Officer is to be recommended for

promotion. By his letter dated 24th November 2017, marked R2, the Colonel

of the Sinha Regiment, while recording the disciplinary record of the Petitioner,

had awarded the Petitioner 78 marks out of a maximum 90 including maximum

marks for integrity and recommended the promotion of the Petitioner. The

Petitioner has also annexed to the petition, marked P6h, the Annual

Confidentiality Report for the period 1st August 2016 to 31st July 2017, where

the Petitioners promotion to the next rank had been recommended by the

Initiating Officer, Major General Ranaweera. Thus, at least during the time

period covered by the said reports, namely 2016/2017, the Petitioner had

been of good conduct and behavior.

11

It is in the above background that the Petitioner was once again considered for

promotion to the rank of Brigadier by the Army Selection Board No. 2 on 28th

November 2017, as well as on 19th December 2017. This Court must note that

the Respondents have not provided this Court with the decisions of the Army

Selection Board No.2 that assembled on the said dates, except to state in their

Statement of Objections that the decision not to promote the Petitioner was

taken in line with the Army Policy for the time being.5 The Policy that is

referred to is the Policy Decision dated 29th June 2016 of the Sri Lanka Army on

Officers who have been Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL), a copy of which

has been annexed to the petition marked P16. In terms of P16, the fact that

an Officer has been AWOL in the past would prevent such Officer from

receiving his next promotion or would prevent such Officer from being eligible

for Command positions. While this Court would discuss the vires of P16 later

on in this judgment, it appears from the averments in the Statement of

Objections that by November 2017, P16 was the sole impediment preventing

the Petitioners promotion.

The Petitioner states that he submitted a Redress of Grievance (ROG) dated 7th

December 20176, and that in response, he was summoned before an Army

Advisory Board comprising of the 6th 11th Respondents, on 15th February

2018. In their Statement of Objections, the Respondents have stated that,

having considered the service of the Petitioner, the Army Advisory Board

assembled on 16.02.2018 decided that the Petitioner could be promoted to the

Temporary rank of Brigadier (when) his turn arrives, to retire upon reaching

5 Vide paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Limited Statement of Objections of the Respondents. By a motion filed on 1st February 2019, the Attorney-at-Law for the Respondents have informed this Court that no further objections would be filed and that the Respondents would rely on the said limited Statement of Objections. 6 Annexed to the petition marked P19.

12

maximum permissible period in the substantive rank of Brigadier. (emphasis

added).7

In support of the above averment, the Respondents have annexed the letter

dated 19th March 2018 issued by the 4th Respondent who is the Military

Secretary, marked R8 which reads as follows:

The Advisory Board assembled on 15th February 2018.

1. An abstract of the minutes of the ref Advisory Board relevant to the

subject is as follows:

(a) A ROG forwarded by the Senior Officer requesting to consider his

promotion and career progression was referred to the Advisory Board

by the Commander of the Army to forward recommendations.

(b) The Senior Officer was given the opportunity to explain the reasons

for submitting the ROG and defend his case. Having listened to the

Senior Officer and scrutinizing the related documents, the Board

observed that the Senior Officer did not possess substantial evidence

to prove the facts in his defence. Subsequent to deliberation, the

Board was of the opinion not to recommend his request favourably;

but having examined the Senior Officers contributions and

considering his present appointment (Serving Brigade Commander),

the Board recommended that he could be promoted to the rank of

Temporary Brigadier in his turn and to retire from the Army on

reaching maximum possible period in the rank of Brigadier.

7 Vide paragraph 25 of the Statement of Objections of the Respondents.

13

2. The Commander of the Army has approved the recommendation of

the Advisory Board. (emphasis added)

The Respondents have stated that the above decision was communicated to

the Petitioner on 26th March 2018.8

It would perhaps not be unreasonable for this Court to assume that the

Commander of the Sri Lanka Army would not have approved the said decision

in R8 unless he was of the view that the promotion of the Petitioner to the

rank of Brigadier was in the best interest of the Army. It is in this context that

the absence of an averment in the Statement of Objections that the

Petitioners promotion is not in the best interest of the Army, becomes

significant.

If the above decision of the Advisory Board was implemented, the Petitioner

was entitled to be promoted as Brigadier, on the date that the first Army

Selection Board No. 2 met i.e. 30th May 2017. The Petitioner could have

thereafter served in that rank for a period of four years, which is until 29th May

2021. This would be approximately seven months prior to the Petitioner

completing 55 years of age, which is the mandatory age of retirement of an

Officer.

However, on 21st February 2018, which is prior to the aforementioned decision

of the Army Advisory Board being communicated, the Petitioner had been

8 Vide letter dated 26th March 2018 marked R9.

14

summoned by the 2nd Respondent, the Colonel of the Sinha Regiment, where

the Petitioner states that the following matters transpired:

a) The Petitioner was shown a letter dated 16th February 2018 bearing

reference No. MSB/4/06/b (Brig) issued by the 4th Respondent;

b) The said letter referred to the poor disciplinary record of the Petitioner

and to the fact that he had been absent without leave for three days in

1995, and for that reason that the Petitioner will not be considered for

future promotions.

c) Upon inquiry as to what is his poor disciplinary record, the 2nd Respondent

had referred to an incident that had taken place at an event organised by

the Old Boys Union of the Petitioner, held at the BMICH in November

2016;

d) The Petitioner was told that he would have to retire on 23rd December

2018 upon reaching the maximum period in the rank of Colonel.9

The Respondents have not denied the aforementioned version of the

Petitioner as to what transpired between the Petitioner and the 2nd

Respondent on 21st February 2018.

The Petitioner states that he was not given a copy of the said letter dated 16th

February 2018, although he had requested for a copy thereof by his letter

dated 8th March 2018.10 Even though the Respondents undertook to produce

9 Vide paragraph 31 of the petition. 10 Vide letter marked P22 annexed to the petition.

15

the said letter,11 and even though the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari

to quash the decision contained in this letter, the Respondents have not

produced this letter to this Court.

Dissatisfied by the decision in the said letter, the Petitioner filed this

application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision made against the Petitioner in

the letter dated 16th February 2018, bearing reference No. MSB/4/06/b;12

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Policy decision marked P16 in so far as

it applies to the Petitioner;13

c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions and/or determinations made

against the Petitioner by the Army Selection Board No. 2;14

d) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to confirm the

Petitioner in the rank of Brigadier (Temporary) with effect from 30th May

2017.

e) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from retiring,

discharging or removing the Petitioner from Sri Lanka Army without

confirming him in the rank of Brigadier (Temporary) with effect from 30th

May 2017.

11 Vide journal entry of 15th November 2018. 12 Paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. 13 Paragraph (g) of the prayer to the petition. 14 Paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition.

16

This Court is of the view that the prayer for the Writ of Mandamus is

misconceived in view of the fact that the Petitioner is not entitled to be

promoted to the rank of Brigadier as of right, and that such promotion is at the

discretion of the Commander, Sri Lanka Army. This Court cannot consider the

Writ of Prohibition for the same reason that the promotion is at the discretion

of the Sri Lanka Army. This Court shall therefore only proceed to consider

whether the Petitioner is entitled to one or more of the above Writs of

Certiorari.

In view of the two contradictory decisions of the Sri Lanka Army i.e. the

decision conveyed to the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent that he must retire

on 23rd December 2018 in his present rank which prompted the filing of this

application, and the subsequent decision of the Army Advisory Board that the

Petitioner can be promoted to the rank of Temporary Brigadier and serve until

he reaches the maximum possible period in that rank this Court inquired

from the learned Additional Solicitor General whether the latter decision could

be implemented. Although the Respondents answered in the affirmative, the

Petitioner was not agreeable as that would mean the Petitioner retiring prior

to reaching the mandatory age of retirement.15

This Court will now proceed to consider the grievance of the Petitioner that the

decision of the Army Selection Board No. 2 held on 28th November 2017, as

well as the decision of the 4th Respondent communicated to the Petitioner by

the 2nd Respondent on 21st February 2018, is irrational and unreasonable, and

therefore are liable to be quashed by Writs of Certiorari.

15 Vide the response of both parties to Question No. 6 posed by this Court.

17

The Respondents, having confirmed in their written submissions filed on 25th

February 2020 that the decisions of the Army Selection Board No. 2 that met

on 28th November 2018 and 19th December 2017 are not before this Court,

have re-produced what is said to be the purported decision, the relevant

portion of which reads as follows:

The Board observes that the Officer possesses poor disciplinary records

including offences of being AWOL for 3 days. Hence, the Board was of the

considered opinion that the Officer does not merit to be promoted to the

rank of Temporary Brigadier. Further considering the existing Army

Headquarters policy decision on AWOL officers, the Board recommends

that the senior officer be retired on completion of maximum permissible

period in the rank of Colonel on 23.12.2018.

However, in paragraph 7 of the written submissions filed on 25th February

2020, the Respondents have answered in the negative the specific question

posed by this Court whether the Petitioners promotion had been rejected due

to the AWOL policy contained in P16. Thus, even though there appears to be

some confusion on the part of the Respondents as to the precise reason for

the rejection of the Petitioners promotion, the extract of the decision of the

Army Selection Board No. 2 makes it clear that the Board was clearly

influenced by the fact that the Petitioner had been absent without leave for

three days in 1995, thus attracting the mandatory provisions of P16.

The first submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Army Selection Board acted illegally and unreasonably when it applied P16 to

the Petitioner. The explanation of the Petitioner with regard to the AWOL

18

incident that occurred in 1995 is that while he was serving in Jaffna, he

obtained five days leave from 27th July 1995 to visit his sick mother at the

General Hospital, Colombo. As there was a shortage of flights to Jaffna, the

Petitioner was able to get a seat only on 3rd August 1995 although he had been

at the Ratmalana Airport waiting for his turn to get a flight from the day his

leave had expired. On his return to the camp, the Petitioner had been

informed that he would be tried for being absent without leave for two days

and fourteen hours. The Petitioner had pleaded guilty to the charge and had

been severely reprimanded.16 It is admitted that the Petitioner was promoted

thereafter, not only to the rank of Major and Lieutenant Colonel, but even to

the rank of Colonel, where the criteria for promotion is identical to that of

promotion to the rank of Brigadier, without the above incident of being absent

without leave being held against him.

The said incident of being absent without leave came to be considered in view

of P16 issued by the then Military Secretary under the heading, Policy

decision on AWOL Officers in June 2016. The concurrence of the Commander

of the Sri Lanka Army had been granted to implement the policy contained

therein, with effect from 1st July 2016, on all Officers of the Sri Lanka Army who

had been absent without leave prior to 20th May 2009.

This Court has examined P16 and observes that it does not contain the

rationale for applying on a retrospective basis a Policy of automatically

depriving Officers of their promotion on the basis that they have been absent

without leave. Nor has this Court been presented with any material or

explanation in the Statement of Objections as to the rationale behind the

16 Vide document annexed to the petition marked P9.

19

retrospective application of such policy automatically.17 What is of significance

is that after pleading guilty to the charge of being absent without leave in

August 1995, the Petitioner has been promoted on three occasions, and has

served in operational areas for a significant period. This demonstrates that the

presence of the Petitioner who has been absent without leave for three days

has not been considered as being detrimental to the objects of the Sri Lanka

Army. While there could have been a perfectly justified reason as to how such

an incident can impact the Sri Lanka Army when considering an Officer to the

rank of Brigadier, the fact of the matter is that no explanation has been offered

in this regard. Thus, while the fact that an Officer has been AWOL in the past

can be one of the factors that could be considered when considering an Officer

for promotion, it is the view of this Court that the automatic application of

such a policy on a retrospective basis, as contained in P16 is unreasonable.

Assuming that P16 is legal and reasonable, there are two paragraphs in P16

that may be applicable to the Petitioner. They are as follows.

Paragraph 1(a)(4)

Officers who have already been promoted to the rank of Colonel or above

should retire on completion of maximum permissible period in the

present rank. Further, such Officers will not be considered for any

command or instructor appointments in the future and will not be granted

17 The policy in P16 was challenged in Major General Nirmal Ajith Dharmaratne vs Lieutenant General N.U.M. Mahesh W. Senanayake and Others [CA (Writ) Application No. 375/2018; CA Minutes of 30th April 2019], on the basis that it was illegal and irrational. The petitioner in that case had sought an interim order preventing the said Policy being applied to him. This Court, having considered the fact that the respondents had not provided any rationale for the introduction of the said policy and that too only in respect of those who had been absent without leave prior to 20th May 2009, issued an interim order staying the operation of P16 in so far as it related to the petitioner in that application.

20

career courses. However, Officers in this category may be considered for

non career courses which will not exceed 90 days and official visits

applicable to the appointments held.

Paragraph 1(a)(7)

Officers in the rank of Colonel and have already completed a tenure as a

Brigade Commander should be promoted to the rank of Brigadier as per

the order of seniority, subject to fulfillment of all other pre-requisites.

Such Officers will not be considered for further command or instructor

appointments and should retire on completion of maximum permissible

period in the rank of Brigadier. May be considered for non career courses

not exceeding 90 days and official visits applicable to the appointments

being held. However, they will not be considered for career courses /

foreign visits and UN deployment.

The Petitioner, while holding the rank of Temporary Colonel, had been

appointed as Commander, 643 Brigade, Oddusuddan on 19th August 2013.

Having held the said appointment for almost three years, the Petitioner had

been appointed as Commander, 581 Brigade on 13th August 2016, until he was

removed without any reason, by letter dated 21st February 2018.18 As the

Petitioner had completed his tenure as Brigade Commander, the provision in

P16 that was applicable to the Petitioner was Paragraph 1(a)(7), in terms of

which the Petitioner was entitled to be promoted to the rank of Brigadier as

per the order of seniority, subject to fulfillment of all other pre-requisites.

18 Vide letter annexed to the petition marked P21.

21

Hence, the provisions of P16 cannot serve as an automatic impediment to the

Petitioners promotion to the rank of Brigadier. In the said circumstances, it is

the view of this Court that the Army Selection Board No.2 acted unreasonably

when it applied P16 to the Petitioner. Similarly, the 4th Respondent, the

Military Secretary erred when he took the Petitioners absence without leave

into consideration, in his letter dated 16th February 2018, the contents of

which were communicated to the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent.

There is one other matter that this Court wishes to advert to, with regard to

P16. The Petitioner has filed with his Counter Affidavit marked X2, a letter

dated 19th October 2017 issued by the 4th Respondent, where Officers

currently holding ranks ranging from Captain to Major General and who had

been absent without leave for periods ranging from a few hours to 14 days had

been exonerated of any wrongdoing by the Commander on the basis that

disciplinary action had not been taken against them and that the incident had

occurred long time ago. The unreasonableness of the application of P16 to

the Petitioner and to others who are similarly placed is demonstrated by the

fact that an Officer who had been punished for being absent without leave is

not entitled to any further promotions or to hold command positions and are

liable to be retired prematurely, whereas Officers who have not been punished

at all although they had been absent without leave, are exonerated and are

entitled for promotion. Furthermore, the Sri Lanka Army has not given the

Petitioner the same concession as it did to those referred to in X2, even

though the period that the Petitioner was absent without leave was less than 3

days. This Court is of the view that it would be irrational and unreasonable to

apply the provisions of P16 to the Petitioner, for the aforementioned reason,

as well.

22

Taking into consideration all of the above factors, it is the view of this Court

that denying the Petitioner his promotion on the basis of P16 is unreasonable

and that the decision of the Army Selection Board No. 2 is liable to be quashed

by a Writ of Certiorari.

The second factor that has influenced the decision of the Sri Lanka Army that

the Petitioner is not eligible to be promoted as a Brigadier is the disciplinary

record of the Petitioner, with the Respondents taking up the position that the

incident that occurred at the BMICH, where the Petitioner, while being under

the influence of alcohol, had attacked the catering staff, justified the decision

of the Army Selection Board No. 2.19 The Petitioner, whilst admitting that such

an incident took place, has however submitted that in considering the

disciplinary record of the Petitioner, the Army Selection Board No.2 ought to

have taken into consideration the following reports which had recommended

his promotion:

(a) The report of the GOC 58th Division marked P5 dated 10th November

2017;

(b) The report of the Colonel of the Sinha Regiment marked R2;

(c) The Annual Confidentiality Report for the period 1st August 2016 to 31st

July 2017 marked P6h.

It was therefore the position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Army Selection Board No. 2 failed to consider relevant facts and for that

19 The Petitioner has admitted this incident in his letter marked P14.

reason, their decision is unreasonable and irrational. It is the view of this Court

that the necessity to consider the above submission of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner does not arise in view of the finding of this Court that the

decision of the Army Selection Board No. 2 is liable to be quashed in view of

the first submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

There are two other matters that this Court must advert to. The first is the

submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the Army Selection

Board No. 2 has only made a recommendation and that a recommendation

cannot be quashed. While this Court is not in agreement with the said

submission, it is of the view that the recommendation of the Army Selection

Board No. 2 affects the rights of the Petitioner and is therefore a decision

which is subject to judicial review. This specific issue has now been laid to rest

by the Supreme Court in the case of Sri Lanka Telecom vs. The Human Rights

Commission20 where his Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew, after an extensive

discussion on several authorities on the said question of law, held as follows:

Considering the above legal literature, I hold that if a recommendation of

a Public Body affects the right of an individual, Superior Courts, in the

exercise of their writ jurisdiction, have the power to quash such a

recommendation by issuing a writ of certiorari.

The second matter that this Court wishes to advert to, are two judgments that

have been referred to by the learned Additional Solicitor General. The first is

the judgment of this Court in Lt. Col. Kottearachchi vs Lt. Gen Senanayake,

Commander, Sri Lanka Army and Others21, where the petitioner challenged

20SC Appeal 215/12; SC Minutes of 1st March 2017. 21 CA (Writ) Application No. 208/2018; CA Minutes of 1st November 2018.

the decision by which he was informed to tender retirement papers. The

Respondents had tendered to this Court the relevant material to substantiate

the said decision, and as to why the Sri Lanka Army had decided not to

promote the Petitioner to the next rank. This Court refused to issue formal

notice of the said application on the Respondents only after it considered the

said material and was satisfied that it had no reason to doubt the

appropriateness of the said decision. The position in this application is

different, as the Respondents have failed to substantiate the reasoning of the

Army Selection Board No. 2.

Similarly, in CA(Writ) Application No. 186/2016,22 this Court refused to

interfere with the decision that the Petitioner must retire on 1st July 2016 as he

had reached the maximum period in the rank of Captain, for the reason that

the said decision had been taken due to the failure on the part of the

petitioner to complete the examinations which were essential to secure his

promotion. The situation in this application however is different.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues Writs of Certiorari in terms of

paragraphs (b), (e) and (g) of the prayer to the petition.

By way of a motion dated 29th May 2020, which has been supported by an

affidavit of Major General H.J.Seneviratne filed on 3rd June 2020, the learned

Additional Solicitor General has brought to the attention of this Court that

while judgment was pending in this matter, the Petitioner had been produced

before the Magistrates Court of Negombo on an allegation that he has

committed offences punishable under Sections 314 and 486 of the Penal Code.

22 CA Minutes of 24th June 2016.

25

It is the view of this Court that this judgment shall not be an impediment to the

Sri Lanka Army taking steps in respect of the said incident against the

Petitioner.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
