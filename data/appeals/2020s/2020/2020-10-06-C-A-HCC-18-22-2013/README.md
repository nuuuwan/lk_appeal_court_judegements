punishable under Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

4) That one or more members of the said unlawful assembly committed hurt

on Ranasinghage Gunapala by shooting in prosecution of the said common

they would be guilty of murder if Ranasinghage Gunapala was killed in the

circumstances and on knowledge or intention of the person or persons who

committed the said act of shooting, an offence punishable under Section

300 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. After trial, the learned High Court Judge found all the appellants guilty on counts

1,2,4,5 and 7 and convicted them accordingly. All appellants were acquitted on

counts 3 and 6. All accused appellants have appealed against their convictions and

sentences.

3. The following grounds of appeal were urged on behalf of the appellants.

GROUNDS OF APPEAL (1'\ 2nd, 3'd and 5'h ACCUSED - APPELLANTS)

1. Has the prosecution proved their case beyond the reasonable doubt?

2. Has the learned Trial Judge taken into consideration matters favorable to the Accused?

3. Has the learned Trial Judge adequately considered the Defendant taken by the

Accused?

GROUNDS OF APPEAL (4'h ACCUSED - APPELLANT)

1. Evidence led at the trial does not support the ingredients of count 1, namely,

the formation of an unlawful assembly.

2. In the absence of an unlawful assembly, count 2 which is murder on the footing of common object necessarily fails.

3. Non- explanation of the injuries on the 5'" accused creates a serious doubt with

regard to the veracity of the prosecution version.

4. Contradictory evidence between PWI namely Ranjith Madduma Bandara and

PW 1 5 namely Cyril further creates a doubt with regard to the prosecution version.

4

5. Trial court has failed to evaluate the dock statement of the 4th accused appellant

in its correct judicial perspective.

6. In the absence of participatory presence on the part of the 4th accused appellant, conviction for murder against the 4th accused appellant on the basis of common murderous intention is untenable and flawed.

Facts in brief

4. This prosecution is consequent to an incident of shooting on 09.12.1999 at a pre

presidential election meeting held at Walakumbura junction to support the then

United National Party presidential candidate. The accused appellants had been the

supporters of the opposing candidate.

5. The prosecution had called upon three eye witnesses to the incident. Ranjith

Maddumabandara had testified as Prosecution Witness No.1 (hereinafter referred to

as PWl). According to his evidence, at about 5.30 pm he had started making his

speech to the crowd of about 150 people who had come to see the meeting. He had

seen the police officers stopping a lorry which came from the direction of Bibi/e.

6. He had seen some persons getting down from the lorry. The lorry had turned back

and stopped by the side of the road towards Bibi/e. Without heeding to what police

said, around six to seven persons got down from the lorry and came towards the

stage. They approached the stage and threatened PW 1 and the people around, stating

that they would not let them have the meeting. PWI identified the 1

5

\ 2nd, 3rd, and 5th

appellants as some of the persons who came and threatened him. He further said that

when the police officers and his bodyguards pushed them back towards the lorry

they came from, he heard gunshots.

7. He had seen the 1st and the 2nd appellants holding T56 guns and firing towards the

crowd. PW I also testified that he saw the 3rd appellant holding an object that looked

5

like a bomb when he came near the stage. He also had seen locally made guns

(galkatas) and bottles with some of them. After shooting, they escaped in the lorry

and the injured was taken to hospital.

8. Kanattahewage Cyril (hereinafter referred to as PW15) had been a police officer in

charge of security duty at the place where the meeting was held. According to his

testimony, he had left the police station at about 3.00pm with two constables and a

security officer. When he was on duty at the place where the meeting was to be held,

at about 3.45 pm, a van came from the direction of Bibile and stopped near the stage.

Five persons including one Samantha alias Naya had got down from the van and had

spoken to him. They had wanted to burn a tyre. PW15 said that it could not be

allowed. They had left after having an argument with two other persons. He had

informed the officer in charge (OlC) of the incident and the OlC came and placed

two more home guards with weapons.

9. At about 5 pm PWI came and he had started the meeting by 5.30pm. When PWI

was making his speech, a lorry came at a high speed towards Badulla from the

direction of Bibile. As the lorry was coming at a high speed, he had ordered the lorry

to be stopped. Including the driver, there had been 5 persons seated on top of each

other. Thereafter, on his directions, the driver turned the lorry and parked it by the

side of the road towards Bibile. He had identified the five appellants as the persons

who came in the lorry. The 3rd appellant had been the driver.

10. The 5'h appellant had been armed with a bottle and he had broken the bottle into two

by hitting the lorry with it. All the appellants were drunk and enraged, and they

made their way towards the stage. The witness had tried to push them towards the

lorry and had managed to push the 151 appellant inside the lorry. When he was trying

to push the other appellants also into the lorry, people around them threw stones at

the appellants. Then, he had seen the 151 appellant shooting towards the Badulla

direction from the direction of Bibile. When he shouted at the 151 appellant not to

shoot, he heard a firing sound from the stage. PWl's security guards had fired

6

towards the lorry. He had seen two of the body guards carrying weapons and firing.

He said that the 1 sl appellant started the shooting first. When the 1 sl appellant was

shooting, the other appellants had been between the lorry and the stage. PW 15 bent

down shouting not to shoot. In the mean time all appellants had escaped in the lorry

towards Medagama. The injured who was lying near the boutique had been taken to

hospital.

II. The other eye witness who testified had been Ranasinghalage Gunapala who had

stopped at the meeting whilst he was on his way back home from the paddy field

carrying his mamoty, to listen to PWl's speech. He had been standing near the

boutique when he heard gunshots from the direction of Bibile, which was towards

his left. He said that it happened after the lorry came and turned back towards Bibile

and stopped. He felt a burning sensation on his shoulder and fell unconscious. He

regained consciousness only once he was in the hospital.

12. The police officers who investigated gave evidence on the recovery of a weapon

from the 1 sl appellant when he was arrested, and also on the recovery of spent

ammunition scattered close to the place where the lorry was parked.

13. All appellants had made statements from the dock. The 1 sl appellant had denied his

presence at the crime scene and also the evidence of the police officers that he was

arrested with a weapon. The 2nd, 3rd 41h and 51h appellants in their dock statements

admitted their presence at the crime scene, but denied any involvement in any

unlawful assembly or the alleged crime.

14. The main ground of appeal pursued by both learned Presidents Counsel for the 1 S\

2nd, 3rd and 51h appellants and the learned Counsel for the 41h appellant was that the

prosecution has failed to prove that the appellants shared the common object as

alleged in the counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the indictment. The common object mentioned

in the above charges was to cause hurt on Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Madduma

Bandara (PW I). It is the contention of learned Counsel for the appellants, that the

7

prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence placed

before High Court that the appellants shared the above common object.

I S. Learned Presidents Counsel for the 1'\ 2nd, 3'd and Sth appellants submitted that, if

any common object was shared by the appellants, according to the evidence adduced

by the prosecution, it may have been to disrupt the election meeting chaired by the

Member of Parliament PWI but not to cause hurt on him. Hence, as the prosecution

has failed to establish the common object of the alleged unlawful assembly, counts

1,2,3 and 4 should fail.

16. Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the respondents submitted that, the

evidence adduced by the prosecution established that the common object of the

unlawful assembly (the members of which are the appellants) had been to cause hurt

to PWI. Learned DSG submitted that the appellants had gone up to the stage and

had told PW 1 that they had wanted him stating " 00& @t:! tcN3 Cf~D t;n iiJlfl)l~zr!"

17. The common object of the unlawful assembly referred to in count I is that of

causing hurt on PWI. Hence, the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt,

the following;

I) That there was an assembly of five or more persons, and

2) That the common object of those members of the assembly was to cause

hurt on PWI.

18. There is ample evidence to prove that the I Sl appellant had also come in the same

lorry with the other appellants to the Yalkumbura junction where the meeting was

held, although he had denied his presence in his dock statement. It was also evident

that the lorry they were travelling in was driven at a high speed and that the lorry

was ordered to be stopped by the police. The best witness to testify as to what

happened as soon as the lorry was ordered to be stopped is PWIS. According to

PWIS, the appellants had got down from the lorry unarmed, except for the Sth

appellant who had been armed with a broken bottle. When the appellants tried to

8

approach the stage, he had managed to push the 1st appellant back to the lorry. When

he tried to push the other appellants back to the lorry, the crowd had pelted stones

towards the appellants. He had then seen the 1st appellant shooting first, towards the

stage and Badulla direction. Thereafter, the security guards of PW I had fired

towards the lorry.

"o.tSt>! @(C@ fiJdtJ30 @lz!JZj}@3@a! 2f1~CMJd @t;@t;2D3 q@t>! qtJ z!Ji?}2D:J. e1 @t;@t:iJd

@!)tJ z!J~fiJ:J. "

19. Although PW I said in evidence that the appellants came near the stage armed with

guns asking him to get down from the stage, the appellants had not caused any hurt

to the PW 1. PW I himself had said that the appellants threatened him stating "d.dtJ@

z!J~d2D @t;zn@d 2DletJl :t3~(53 2))&f2D~ t:iJ(53." Even if the evidence of PWI as to

what happened at that point in time is accepted, and if the object of the appellants

was to cause hurt on PW I, the appellants could have done so at that stage of the

events. Thus, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the object of the appellants

was to cause hurt on PWI or to disrupt the meeting.

20. It is pertinent to note that according to PW 15, when the appellants initially got down

from the lorry, at that point in time the appellants had been unarmed. Further,

according to PW 15, he had immediately managed to push the 1

51 appellant back to

the lorry. Thus, if the 1

51 appellant threatened PW I having gone near the stage as he

initially got down from the lorry, it could not have escaped the knowledge or the

field of vision ofPW15. When considering the evidence ofPWI5 as a whole, it can

be concluded that the evidence of PWI5 is credible and safe to act upon.

21. It was evident that, the same afternoon at about 3.30, Sampath alias Naya with

others had come and sought permission from PW 15 to burn tyres. The learned DSG

contended that the afternoon incident makes it further clear that there had been an

unlawful assembly which continued. The learned DSG relied upon the case of

Vitllanalage Anl/ra Tlll/sllaro De Mel and others V. Han. Attorney General

SCTABI2A-DI2017(Dllminda Silva case). The learned DSG submitted that the

9

sequence of events show that the unlawful assembly in this case had continued as in

case of Dumunda Silva (supra).

22. In the Duminda Silva case, the common object of the unlawful assembly mentioned

in the charges was criminal intimidation of voters with the use of fire anns, and that,

in prosecution of that common object the other offences were committed. The

common object in that case was not, to cause hurt on the deceased or other victims.

However, in the instant case the common object mentioned in the charge of unlawful

assembly is to cause hurt on PW I. Hence it is incumbent upon the prosecution to

prove beyond reasonable doubt that the common object of the unlawful assembly

was to cause hurt to PWI. Therefore, on the issue of common object, the Duminda

Silva case would not be relevant to this case. There is a clear doubt created about the

common object, as to whether it was to cause hurt on PWI or to disrupt the meeting

that was to be held, when the sequence of events is taken into consideration.

23. In the case of Sirisena Ranawaka and Others V. The Attorney General [1985) 2Sri

LR 210 it was held;

'The only common object of the unlawful assembly alleged in count No.1

was to cause hurt to Heen Banda. The act ofsettingjire to the car was in

no way connected to the common object of the unlawful assembly as

specified in count No.1. The offence must be committed in prosecution of

the common object. Hence Count 4 fails. '

24. In the case of Samy ami Others V. Aftomey General/2007j 2 Sri LR

216 (Bindunuwewa Murder Case), it was observed;

'The effect of this section was considered in the early case of

Kulafhunga V. Mudalihamy (I) where it was held that the prosecution

must prove that there was an unlawful assembly with a common object as

stated in the charge . ... '

10

25. In the case of Ratnayake Mudiyanse/age Sunil Ratnayake V. Hon. Attorney

General (SC TAB 011201625.04.2019) (Mirusavil case), the Supreme Court

observed;

'Hence the prosecution case has starved the case of evidence as to

whether those two who took Raviwarman made any gestures causing

apprehension to Raviwarman that those two persons were about to use

criminal force on him. With the paucity of evidence on this aspect, a

doubt lingers as to whether the reason for taking Raviwarman away was

with the object of questioning Raviwarman in order to ascertain the

reasons for their presence in the locality or to commit assault within the

meaning of section 342 of the Penal Code. In this context, I hold that the

prosecution had failed to establish that there was an unlawful assembly

with the common object of committing assault on Raviwarman within the

meaning of section 342 of the Penal Code. Thus, counts 1 to 10 of the

indictment must necessarily fail. Accordingly, 1 set aside the conviction

of the Accused-Appellant on counts Ito 10. '

26. With the above line of case precedents, it is settled law that it is incumbent upon the

prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged common object was

shared by the appellants, in this case that it was to cause hurt on PW 1. As I

mentioned before, the prosecution has fai led to prove beyond reasonable doubt that

the common object of the assembly of the appellants was to cause hurt on PW 1 as

alleged. Therefore, I find that the above ground of appeal has merit and that counts 1

to 4 should fail.

27. I will now turn to the rest of the grounds of appeal urged by the appellants, that

refers to common intention. The remaining counts 5 and 7 are based on vicarious

liability of common intention. All the evidence adduced before the trial Court has to

be considered holistically to come to a finding on the person or persons who

committed the offences alleged in counts 5 and 7 and whether the appellants shared

the common intention when committing those acts. It is also important to note that a

11

common intention could be formed in the spur of the moment without any pre-

planning.

28. It is the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1 't, 2nd, 3rd and 51h

appellants as well as the learned Counsel for the 41h appellant that in terms of the

evidence of PW IS, none of the other appellants shared a common intention with the

151 appellant. In his unsworn statement from the dock, the 1

51 appellant denied his

presence at the scene.

29. Although the I st appellant had denied his presence at the crime scene there is cogent

evidence to prove not only that the 1 st appellant was present but also that he fired

shots from a T56 weapon from the place where the lorry they came was parked,

towards the direction of Badulla where the deceased in count 5 and the injured in

count No.7 had been standing. As I stated before, it is evident that it was PWI5 who

ordered to stop the vehicle. When the appellants initially got down from the lorry,

they had been unarmed except for the 51h appellant who carried a bottle. Although

the PW 1 had denied anyone pelting stones on the appellants, PW15 had clearly

testified that the crowd threw stones at the appellants. He then had seen the 1st

appellant whom he pushed into the lorry before, firing with a T56 weapon. It is

obvious that the 1 st appellant had used the weapon that had been in the lorry. Hence,

the rest of the appellants could not have had the opportunity to share any common

intention of committing the acts of firing with the I st appellant even in the spur of

the moment.

30. The learned High Court Judge has relied solely on the evidence ofPWl, to come to

the conclusion that the 2nd appellant also used a T56 weapon to shoot at the stage or

the crowd. PW 1 in his evidence said that the 2nd appellant also carried a weapon

when he initially came near the stage. However, if the 2nd appellant carried a weapon

when he came out of the lorry, PW 15 should have seen it. It was the evidence of

PW IS that only the I st appellant used a weapon, and that is also after the 1st

appellant was pushed inside the lorry by him. Therefore, it was unsafe for the

learned High Court Judge to conclude that the 2nd appellant also used a weapon

12

based on the sole evidence of PW I, when in fact PW IS had not seen the 2nd

appellant using or carrying a gun. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at

page 36 (page 630 of the brief) has opined that PW I could be considered an

independent witness, and also that he had given evidence with some exaggeration. In

this context it is unsafe to justify the inconsistencies between the evidence of PWI

and PWI5 especially on the evidence of the 2nd appellant using a weapon, when in

fact PWI5 who was much closer to the 2nd appellant did not see him using a

weapon. It is also unsafe to conclude on the sole evidence of PW I, that all the

appellants carried weapons when they came towards the stage, when in fact the

credible and reliable PW 15 clearly stated that they did not. It is clear from the

evidence of PWI5 that the I sl appellant started shooting only after he was pushed

inside the lorry and that even the I sl appellant did not carry a weapon when he

initially got down from the lorry and approached the stage.

31. In the case of The Queen V. P.G. Arasa and another (1966) 70 NLR at page 404 it

was held;

'This court has held on numerous occasions that mere presence is not a

sufficient circumstance to justifY an inference of common intention. Such

an inference would not have been reached in this case butfor areference

by the learned Trial Judge to the fact that the second appellant "did

nothing to prevent the first accused from stabbing". According to the

evidence the stabbing took place so suddenly that it was in our opinion

quite unreasonable to suggest to the jury that the second appellant

should have tried to interfere. '

32. In the case of King V. Assappu (1948) 50 NLR 324 it was held;

" We are of opinion that in all cases where the question of common

intention arises the Judge should tell the Jury that, in order to bring the

rule in section 32 into operation, it is the duty of the prosecution to

satisfY them beyond all reasonable doubt that a criminal act has been

done or committed ; that such act was done or committed by several

persons; that such persons at the furtherance of the common intention of

13

all; and that such intention is an ingredient of the offence charged, or of

some minor offence. The Judge should also tell the Jury that in applying

the rule of common intention there are certain vital and fundamental

principles which they must keep prominently in mind - namely (a) the

case of each prisoner must be considered separately; (b) that the Jury

must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was actuated by a

common intention with the doer of the criminal act at the time the alleged

offence was committed ; (c) they must be told that the benefit of any

reasonable doubt on this matter must be given to the prisoner

concerned - 47 N. L. R. at p 375 ; (d) the Jury must be warned to be

careful not to confuse " Common intention " ; (e) that the inference of

common intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary

inference deducible from the circumstances of the case - A. 1. R. 1945 P.

C. 118; (f) the Jury should be told that in order justify the inference that

a particular prisoner was actuated by a common intention with the doer

of the act, there must be evidence, direct or circumstantial, either of pre-

arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration showing common

intention, or some other significant fact at the time of the commission of

the offence, to enable them to say that a co-accused had a common

intention with the doer of the act, and not merely a same or similar

intention entertained independently of each other - 47 N. L. R. at 375, 48

N. L. R. 295 ; (g) the Jury should also be directed that if there is 0

evidence of any common intention actuating the co-accused or any

particular co-accused, or if there is any reasonable doubt on that point,

then the charge cannot lie against anyone other than the actual doer of

the criminal act - 44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L. R. 135,473,475; (h) in such

a case such co-accused would be liable only for such criminal acts which

they themselves committed; (i) the Jury should also be directed that the

mere fact the co-accused were present when the doer did the criminal act

does not per se constitute common intention, unless there is other

evidence which justifies them in so holding - 45 N. L. R. 510; and 0) the

14

Judge should endeavor to assist the Jury by examining the case against

each of the co-accused in the light of these principles. "

33. In the case of Mapalagama Arachchige Ariyarathne V. Attorney General [19931

BLJR Vol V.Part 1 (SC No. 31192), it was held that;

"(a) the inference of a common intention must be not merely a possible

inference but a necessary inference.

(b) It is a strict rule that the presence of an accused at the scene alone

cannot suffice to establish a common intention. "

34. In the instant case I am of the considered view that it is unreasonable for the Court to

conclude that the 2nd to 51h appellants shared the common intention with the 151

appellant to shoot at the crowd or the victims. The 1'1 appellant after being pushed

inside the lorry had suddenly come out with the weapon and had fired. There is no

evidence that the other appellants had any opportunity to even converse with the 151

appellant at that point in time.

35. Hence, I find that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 51h appellants cannot be found to be

vicariously liable for the shooting done by the 151 appellant, and the learned High

Court Judge has erred in concluding so. Therefore, the remaining grounds of appeal

preferred by the 41h accused appellant need not be considered further.

36. As I have stated before in paragraph 29, the learned High Court Judge had rightly

rejected the position taken by the 151 appellant that he was not at the crime scene

when the shooting incident took place. There is credible evidence of PW15 that the

151 appellant came in the lorry, and also that he was the first to shoot using the T56

weapon after the 151 appellant was pushed inside the lorry by him. A T56 weapon

had been recovered from the 1'1 appellant. It was also evident that the 151 appellant

had gone to the Bibile police station with others and had threatened the crime OlC.

The then crime OlC of Bibile police station Mohammed Jausi (PW22) testified to

15

..

that fact. Hence, the learned High Court Judge was correct in rejecting his dock

statement that he was elsewhere.

37. The learned High Court Judge In his judgment has carefully and adequately

discussed as to how he came to the conclusion that it was the shooting by the 1st

appellant that caused the injuries to the deceased and the injured in count No.7

Gunapala. Sixteen empty cartridges were found scattered near the lorry where the 1 st

appellant fired the weapon. The investigating officer PW3 had clearly observed the

damage on the concrete lamp post. The damaged caused to the lamp post by a bullet

had been towards the direction of Bibile. PW 15 testified that the 1 st appellant fired

from the direction of Bibile towards Badulla. Victim Gunapala who was clearly an

independent witness had said that the shooting was done from the direction of

Bibile. Shooting by the security guards of PWI in retaliation had been from the

direction of the stage towards the lorry which was parked towards the direction of

Bibile. Hence, in the circumstances, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the

injuries caused to the deceased and the victim Gunapala were caused by the 1st

appellant by shooting, and by no one else. It is an inescapable inference that can be

drawn by the proved circumstances.

38. The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st appellant submitted that there is a

possibility that the 1st appellant had no option but to shoot in retaliation, when the

aggressive crowd started pelting stones at them. The I st appellant had been

intoxicated. The learned Presidents Counsel urged the court to consider lesser

culpability on the I st appellant.

39. It was evident that the appellants were from the opposing political party of the

people who organized the meeting. When the lorry that the appellants came was

stopped, the appellants on their own had tried to go towards the stage. It was

evident that they had been under the influence of alcohol and ravaged. PW15 had in

fact tried to prevent them. Under these circumstances it had been the appellants

being from the opposing political party who had provoked the crowd. They should

16

have expected the crowd to get agitated. It was also evident that the 1 st appellant

fired the shots first, and the body guards ofPWI had only retaliated thereafter.

40. Although there was evidence that the appellants were under the influence of

alcohol, there had been no evidence to show that the I st appellant was so intoxicated

that he was incapable of knowing the nature of the act he was committing by reason

of such intoxication. Further, there was no evidence to show that the alcohol was

administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. Hence, the first

appellant was not entitled to get the benefit of the defence of intoxication in terms

of Section 78 of the Penal Code.

41. For the aforesaid reasons the conviction of the 1st appellant on Counts No.5 and 7

are affirmed. Sentences imposed on the I st appellant on Counts 5 and 7 are also

affirmed. First appellant is acquitted of the rest of the counts.
