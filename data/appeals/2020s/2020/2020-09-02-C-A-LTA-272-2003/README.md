III This is an application lor leave to appeal filed by the Plaintin~Petitioner

li'om the order of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dated

11.07.200:1. By that order, the learned Additional District Judge of Galle

approved the alternative scheme of partition proposed by Mr.M.C.Mendis,

Licensed Surveyor as contained in Plan No. 2027 dated 19.05.2001

marked 'Y'.

Background

121 The Plaintiff-Petitioner (hereinalter referred lo as the PlaintiH)

instiluled the above-mentioned action in the District Court of Galle by

Plaint dated 17.01.1990 seeking to partition a land called 'Pelawatta alias

Talapathtattitottam" in extent of I rood and 18 perches. The said land is

depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 150 dated 19.01.1992 marked "X"

made by Mr. A. Weerasinghe, Licensed Surveyor in extent of I rood and

8 perches.

Trial and the Judgement

131 After t.rial, t.he juc1i,,'lnent was entered on 09.01.1992 and the

int.erlocutory decree was entered accordingly. No appeal was filed against

the said judgment of the District. Court. of Galle. The interlocutory decree

was however, ;unended by the learned District.l udge to reflect the orders

made by him in the judgment (Vide- journal ent.ies nos. S7 and (is).

141 The commission was issued to the Commissioner Mr. A. Weerasinghe

who tendered the proposed scheme of partition as contained in Plan No.

IS0jA dated 2:1.07.1998 marked "Z" (Annexure "A"). At the instance of

the [j'h and 7"' Defell(lant." Mr. C. M. Mendis, Licenesed Surveyor

prepared an alternative scheme of partition and tendered his Plan No.

2027 dated 19.0S.2001 marked "Y" (Annexure "B").

Scheme Inquiry and Order

151 At t.he scheme inquiry, Mr. C. Mendis who prepared the alternative

plan No. 2027 marked "Y" gave evidence in support of the said Plan No.

2027 while Mr. A. Weerasinghe who prepared the Commissioner's Plan

No. 150A gave evidence in support of his Plan No ISOA marked "Z".

l(il At the scheme inquiry, the Plaintifl's position was that (i) as the Plaintiff

has not been given a frontage to the Galle-Matara Road due to the locat.ion

of her lot "K" on the SOUtll of tile road closer to tbe sea shore and it.,

vulnerability to sea erosion, she is entitled to a 10 feet wide roadway to her

lot marked "K" as suggested by the Commissioner; (ii) the a feet wide

road tllat has been proposed by Mr. Mendis marked "N" in common is a

footpath which is inadequate to reach tlle public road to the East.

171 On the other hand, the position of the S"' and the 7"' Defendant., was

til at (i) as the 11 d, defendant was not a co-o\Yner and she had claimed only

the cesspit and the concrete slab, she was only enttled to a cess pit and the

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle P/ I0953

concrete pit (item '4' in both plans) in terms or the amended

interelocutory decree, but the Commisisomer had given a land in extent of

4.5 perches contrary to the interlocutry decree; (ii) their g-arbage cannot be

taken to the main road due to the location of the buildings which are

adjacent to each other and thus, the road marked "N" !,riven by Mr. C.

Mendis as contained in Plan No. 2027 marked "Y" to be used by all the

palties is just and reasonable.

181 The learned Additional District Judge by his order dated 11.07.200:3

rejected the Commissioner's Plan No. 150A on the ground that it is

contrary to the amended interlocutory decree and held that the alternative

Plan prepared by Mr. C. Mendis as contained in Plan No. 2027 marked

"Y" is in conformity with the amended interiocutOI1' decree and that the

said alternative Plan is a just and reasonable division of the corpus of the

action.

Leave to Appeal

191 Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Additional District

.J udge of Galle, the Plaintiff has filed this application for leave to appeal.

Leave to Appeal was granted by this Court by order dated 12.06.2020 on

the following question of law:

Has the learned Additional District Judge of Galle erred in law by

accepting the alternative scheme of partition proposed by M. C.

Mendis, Licensed Surveyor in Plan No. 2027 dated 15.01.1992

marked "Y" without appreciating the fact that the scheme of

partition proposed by the Commissioner, A. Weerasinghe in Plan

No. 150A dated 2:3.07.1998 marked "Z" is in confOimity with the

interlocutory decree and that it ensures a fair and equitable division

of the land in question?

The parties are only entitled to compensation in respect of temporary

~~tllin the balance portion of land on a priority basis ha~ng reg-ard to

tile date and tile period of purchase.

Is the Commisioner's Plan No. 150A conformity with the amended

interlocutory decree?

1121 At the hearing the learned President's Counsel lor tile 5th and the 7"'

Defendants, Mr. Rohan Sallabandu submitted tllat although the 11"

Defendant was entitled only to the cesspit wi til the concrete slab as shown

in item 4 of the Preliminary Plan No. 150 marked "X", the Commissioner

had given lot "13" in extent of 4.5 perches to the II "' Defendant which is in

LTA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle P/ I0953

-,

excess of the land area or the cesspit and the concrete slab contrary to the

amended interlocutory decree when the extent of the land with the cesspit

and the concrete slab is only Ij2 perch as admitted by the Commissioner in

his evidence.

1131 Mr. Sahabandu submitted that Mr. C. Mendis in the alternative Plan

No. 2027 has given lot "13" to the 11 "' Defendant which is in extent of 1.4

perches in conformity with the amended preliminary Plan. The submission

of Mr. Sahabndu was that the learncd District.Judge has clearly observed

that dle Commissioner has acted widlout authority whereas Mr. C. Menelis

has acted in conformity with the amended interlocutory decree.

1141 The learned Counsel lor dIe Plaintiff did not make any submission

with regard to dle finding of the learned Additional District Judge in

allotting lot "IV' in extent or 4.!i perches to the 11'10 Delendant as his main

complaint was that the Plaintiff had been deprived of a proper roadway

within the corpus to reach the public rodway.

11!i1 Section B6 (I) ofdle Partition Law reads as follows:

"On the date fixed under section 35, or on any later date which the

Court may fix for the purpose, the Court may, after summary inquiry,

(a) confirm with or without modification dle scheme of partition

proposed by the surveyor and enter a final decree of partition

accordingly:

(b) ..... "

1161 There are two conflicting plans submitted by the Plaintiff and the 5"'

and 7'" Derendants and hence, the District Judge has to consider which

scheme of partition is in conformity of the amended interlocutory decree

and which proposed division is a just ,md equitable division or the corpus.

L TA-027212003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

Adjustment of Lot "B" in line with the amended interlocutory decree

1171 A perusal of the order of the leamed Additional District Judge of

Galle, reveals that he had proceeded to consider which plan is in

conformity ",~th the amended interlocutory decree and which scheme is a

just and equit.1.ble division of the corpus. The learned Additional District

Judge has observed that the Commissioner had given a portion of land to

the II "' Defendant in excess of the land area given in the amended

interlocutory decree whereas Mr. C. Mendis has acted in confOlmity with

the amended interlocutory decree.

1181 According to the Plaintiffs pedigree, the Plaintiff has not gIVen

undivided shares to the II "' Defendant who is living in the adjoining land to

the West of the corpus of action. The II"' Defendant who was present at

the preliminary survey had only claimed the cesspit and the concrete slab

(item No.4 of the prelimimu), plan) as it is shown in the Commissioner's

Report marked "X I ". The II ~ Delendant who is the sister of dle Plaintiff

had not, however, intervened, claiming undivided rights in the corpus of

the action.

1191 At the trial, the Plaintiff had stated that the II "' Defendant was only

entided to the cesspit shown as item No.4 of dle preliminaI), plan and at

her instance, the II "' Defendant was added as a P,lIty to dle action on

07.06.1996. The II "' Defenc\;U1t had not filed a statement of claim ,U1d her

lawyer had told the learned DistrictJudge dlat no statement of claim would

be filed on her behalf (Vide- proceedings dated 07.02.1996).

1201 AldlOlIgh dle original interiocutOl), decree referrd to the II ~

Defendant's rights as the cesspit with the concrete slab and dle land

underneath, dle learned District Judge had corrected the interiocutOl),

decree by stating that dle II "' Defendant is only entided to dle cesspit and

LTA-027212003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

,

the concrete slab with the said strip of land (x 8@b !j!o~ 4 ElCS<l@OO @oei5El:J

interlocutory decree submitted to Court on 2G.01.l998 and the journal

entry no. 68 dated 24.02.1998).

1211 When the scheme inquiry WdS proceeding, the learned Additional

DistTict Judge has further observed on 23.01.2003 that the 11"' Defeml<mt

is entitled to the cesspit with the concrete slab and the said stricp of land

("X" 8@@b !j!o~ 4 ElCS<l@C'lei5 @oei5El:J !j!o51 @~)ei5@(j @~ el@1:ll Elc86J El@ = 00

i2l@ 6'l6cEl) and thus, the amended interlocutory decree was further

corrected (vide- amended interlocutory decree at page 377 of the record).

It is crystal clear that in terms of tile amended interlocutory decree, the

II 'h Defendant who is not a co-owner is only enLitled to the cesspit with the

concrete slab and the said strip of land

1221 According to the evidencc of tile Commissioner, Mr. A. Weerasinghe,

the land area tllat falls within tile cesspit and tile concrete slab is only if2

perch in extent, but he had given a block of l,md in extent of 4.5 perches

(lot "13" in Plan No. 150A) to the 11"' Delendant, which is 8 times more

than tile land extent of the cesspit and the concrete slab (Vide- pages 272-

273 of the record).

1231 On the otllcr hand, the Commissioner had valued the cesspit and tile

concrete slab at Rs. 2000/- and the land extent thereof in extent of 4 . .'J at

Rs. 27,000/- when tile 11"' Defendant was not a co-owner of the land and

thus, she was only entitled to the cesspit with concrete slab and the said

stTip of land. The Commissioner has admitted in evidence that he had no

authority to allot a block of 4 . .'J perches to the II "' Defendant in terms of

the amended interlocutory decree when the land area of tile cesspit and tile

concrete slab WitS only 1/2 perch (Vide- page 272 of the record). l Imler such

circumstances, the learned Additional DistrictJ udge has correctly decided

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

that as regards lot "B" given to the II ~ Defendant, the Commissioner's

Plan No. 150A is not in conformity with the amended interlocutOlY decree

entered in the partition case.

1241 On the other hand, Mr. Mendis had given a land in extent of 1.4

perches (lot "8" in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y") to the II ," Defendant

which comprises the cesspit and the concrete slab, which I find is in

conformity with the amended interlocutory decree as observed by the

learned Additional District Judge. Accordingly, the Commissioner's Plan

o. 150A shall be adjusted in line with dle order made by the learned

Additional DistrictJudeg by allotting lot "B" in extent of 1.4 perches to the

II "' Defendant as depicted in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y".

Adjustment of Lot "K" in line willi llie anlened interlocutory decree

1251 It is not in dispute that all other Defendants are occupying buildings

f~lcing the Galle-Matara Road except the Plaintiff and thus, there is no way

of giving the main road access to the Plaintiff. The next question is when

dle II"' Defendant's lot "B" is adjusted as depicted in Plan No. 2207

marked "Y", whether the Plaintitl's lot "K" together with a I 0 feet wide

road access to a public road to the East can be accommodated as depicted

in the Commissioner's Plan No. 150A marked "Z" in a manner which

would be beneficial to the Plaintitl.

1261 When lot "B" is adjusted in line with dle amended interlocutory

decree as depicted in Plan TO. 2207 marked "Y", there is a portion orland

Ie It below the adjusted lot "13" on dle southern and western side of the

corpus. Lot "C" which is adjoining lot "13" cannot be further adjusted

within the remaining portion of lot "8" depicted in Plan No. 150A marked

"Z" due to the location of lot "C" within the corpus. When the II ~

Deendant's lot "13" in extent of 1.4 perches is adjusted in line with the

LTA-027212003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

,

1

amended interlocutory decree, it is inevitable that lot "K" shall also be

shifted to the west of the corpus of the action as correctly depicted in M r.

C. Mendis's Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" as a separate lot in extent of 7

perches ..

1271 l J nder such circumstances, the learned Additioanl District.J udge

cannot be blUlted in accepting a part of the scheme of partition as reg,mls

the adjustment of lots "\3" in extent of 1.4 perches and lot "K" in extent of

7 perches as depicted in Plan No. 2207 made by Mr. C. Mendis marked

"Y" .

Proper roadway to be given to the Plaintiff and the other parties within the

corpus

1281 The next question that arises for determination is whetller tile 10 feet

wide road suggested by Mr. A. Weerasinghe or a 3 teet wide road

suggested by Mr. C. Mendis is the proper right of way to be given to the

Plaintitf and the other parties.

1291 It is seen Ii-om the Plan suggested by Mr. A. Weerasinghe tI1at tile

Plaintiff has been given a 10 leet wide road within lot "K" along tile

soutl1ern boundary to reach her lot "K" from the public road on the East

on the /-,'Tound tI1at due to sea erosion, it cannot be further reduced. On

tI1e otller hand, the road marked "N" suggested by Mr. Mendis in Plan No.

2207 miu-ked "N" is a common roadway to be used by all the parties as a

road access to the public road on the East of the corpus.

1301 The important question is whelller 1l1e road suggested by Mr. C.

Mendis marked "N" to reach lot "K" Ii-om the public road to tile East is a

proper roadway having regard to its width and the location of lot "K" and

its beneficial use to tile Plaintiff.

L T A-027212003 D.C. Galle PI1 0953

1311 At the hearing Mr. Gunawardena submitted that as the judgment is

silent on the nature of the roadway to be given, it is the duty of the DistJ-ict

Judge to provide a proper right of way to the parties from within the corpus

as access to a public right of way. He relied on 2 authorities in

AI7W-;lSJilgiJe v. WalJigasUJiya (1994) 2 Sri LR 203 and Udalagama alJd

od7ers v. Kempitiya (2002) 3 Sri L.R.I. In both cases, the COUlt of Appeal

held that in the process of partitioning, proper right~ of way should be

provided Ii-om within the corpus as access to a public right of way

1321 He further submitted that the Commissioner had /-,riven a 10 leet wide

road within the Plaintill's lot "K" as depicted in Plan 10 150A due to the

sea erosion that takes place as lot "K" is located closer to the seashore and

thus, the said 10 leet wide road cannot be further reduced. His contention

was Ulat Mr. C. Mendis in his alternative plan had reduced Ule width of the

road Ii-om 10 feet to a 3 feet wide footpath, which cannot be used at least

to take a Three-Wheeler Taxi to lot "K" from Ule public road to the East.

He further submitted Ulat the Plaintilrs grievance is Ulat while all other

palties enjoy the road frontage of the Galle-Matara Road as well as the

road marked "N" /-,riven to Ulem by Mr. C. Mendis in Plan No. 2027, Ule

Plaintill's road had been reduced to a mere 3 feet wide footpath as

depicted in Plall No. 2207, which is unreasobnable and against Ule

purpose of the scheme of pal-tition.

1331 As noted, when the II "' Defendallt's 1.4 perch lot "13" is adjusted in

line WiUl the anlended interlocutory decree, the Plaintill's lot "K" also has

to be adjusted by shifting it to the South-West of Ule corpus. Under such

circumstances, if the Plaintitl"s lot "K" is also to be provided wiUl a 10 feet

wide road within her 7 perch block of lalld after shifting lot "K" to the

South-West of Ule corpus, it is obvious that the Plaintitl's lot "K" will

,

.\ , \

;

become a narrow strip of land making it impoosiblc for the Plaintiff to usc

the land for any benefical purpose.

1 :~4 1 Mr. Shabandu submitted, however, that as the entire land is a small

land in extent of 48 perches and consisting of several buildings, there is no

other way, other than the manner suggested by Mr. C. Mendis in Plan No.

2027 marked "Y". Mr. Sahabandu conceded, however, that the road

marked "N" was further reduced to provide a road to the parties who

occupy the buildings which are adjacent to each other as it becomes clear

that the removal of garbage should be donc only through the road to the

East.

1351 His contention was that tile learned District Judge had accepted the

Pl,m marked "Y" which had given the road marked "N" to be used by the

parties who occupy the buildings which are adjacent to each otller to reach

the public road to the East after having evaluated the evidence of two

Surveyors on the balance of probability and therefore, his findings which

are based on pure questions of facts cannot be treated as perverse or

unreasonable. In support of contention, he cited several judgments.

1361 [ totally agree with Mr. Sahabandu that the Court of Appeal will not

lightly disturb the findings of lacts, especially with regard to the credibility

of witnesses unless the lindings are highly unreasonable or perverse. This

view is supported by tile judl,'lllent of the Privy Council in Fraad v. Brown

& Company Ltd 20 NLR 282 wherein tile Privy Council stated tllUS:

"It is rare that a decisioll of a judge so express, so expliCit upon a poillt of fact purely, /5 ovenvled by a COlllt of Appeal, because

Lordship the Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva observed that "it is well

established that the linding or primary facts by the trial judge who hears

and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal.". In

G'ulJewardene v. C1bral and OdJers 1980 (2) SRLR 220, Rodrigo .J. held

til at the Appellate Court will set aside inferences drawn by the trial judge

only if they amount to findings of fact based on:

(a) Inadmissible evidence; or

(b) After rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; or

(c) If the inferences are unsuppOIted by evidence; or

(d) If tile inferences or conclusions are not rationally possible or

perverse.

1381 A perusal of Mr. C. Mendis's Plan No. 2027 ("Y") and his RepOIt

reveals that the road marked "N" is only 3 feet \\~d e road that has been

given within the corpus to be used by all tile parties. The evidence of Mr.

C. Mendis was that the road marked " "could be used by all tile parties,

especially by those who occupy buildings which are adjacent to each other

to take tlleir garbage witllOUt going through tile Main Road. The learned

District Judge who inspected the corpus of action on 09.09.1999 had

clearly observed that the blocked cesspit marked 27 could not be cleaned

due to the fact that the Municipality Lorry could not reach tile place where

the cesspit was located li'om tile rear side of tile corpus. The revalant

observations of tile learned DistTict.ludge on 09.09.1999 are as follows:

1:~91 Even if it can be assumed that the parties who occupy the adjacent

buildings marked I, 5, I a, I (j, 19, 2a and 26 are able to take Uleir g-d.rbage

and use other utility services through the Galle-Matara Road, a perusal of

both Plans reveals Ulal a part of tl1e corpus in extent of a.6 perches

between the ti-ont buildings and the Galle-Malara Main Road had already

been acquired by the State for the expansion of the Galle-Matara Road. It

seems to me that once Ule acquisition is finalized, it is likely that there will

no space whaL~oever, on the northem boundary to be used as a utility area.

1401 In this context, the learned Additional DistrictJudge having evaluated

the e \~dence of two Surveyors has decided that since the parties who

occupy the a~jacent buildings are to be given strips of 10L~ towards the

south, it is reasonable to provide them with a roadway Ii-om the rear

portions of their lots to reach the public road which is situated on the

eastern side of the corpus. His lindings at page 3 of dle order are as

1411 I am of the view dlat the said decision of the learned Additional

District,Judge to pro\~de the road marked "N" to be used by dle parties

who occupy the adjacent buildings marked I, 5, 8, 1:1, 16, 19, 2:~ and 26 to

reach the public road to the East Ii-om the rear portion 01' the corpus

cannot be reg-d.rded as unreasonable having regard to the location of the

corpus and the narrow strips of lots to be allotted to them.

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle P/I 0953

Is the road marked "N" a proper roadway to reach Lot "K"?

1421 A perusal of Mr. Mendis's Report however, reveals that Mr. C.

Mendis had originally carved out a 4 Ih_ 5 feet \,~de road along the

souLhern boundary and thereafter, he had reduced the said 5 teet ~de

road Lo 3 feet to be used by the parties who occupy the adjacent buildings

to reach the public road to the East fi-om the rear portion of the land. His

own Report confirms this position is as follows:

1431 Mr. Sahabandu strenuously argued that the \~dth of the road marked

"N" cannot be fUIther ~dened due to the smaller land consisting of several

buildin!,'S and thus, the only way in which the road marked "N" could be

given ,~thout affecting the rights of the other parties was the manner

suggested by Mr. C. Mendis. His argument is however, not unsuppOlted by

the facts bome out by the record.

1441 It is seen from the observations made by the learned District.ludge on

09.09.1999 that the Plaintill's lot could be given from the western portion

of the land and the road access to the Plaintitl's lot could also be given

along the southem boundary in equal extent to the public road to the East.

The learned DistricUudge had further observed that buildings 27 and 28

in lot''./'' would not be atlected by the allocation of a road on the southem

boundary of the corpus. The said observations are as follows:

1451 A perusal of Mr. A. Weerasinghe's Plan No. 150A further reveals that

even alter having given a 10 feet wide road within lot "K", none of the

buildings referred to in the Preliminary Plan No. 150 marked "X" or Plan

No. 150A would be affected by the widening of the road along the

southern boundary of the corpus.

1461 The reduction of the road m,u-ked "N" by Mr. C. Mendis in Plan No.

2027 marked "Y" has however, resulted in increasing the extent of the lots

allotted to the 3'" Detendant, 5'" Defendant, 6'" Defendant and the r

Defend;mts, in comparision with Mr. A. Weerasinghe's Plan No. 150A by

0.4, 0.5, 0.2 and 0.2 perches respectively, while the width of the road

marked "N" had been drastically reduced from I 0 feet to :1 teet.

1471 On the other hand, Mr. C. Mendis himself had observed in his Report

marked "Y2" that the 7''' Defendant who was given lot ''.)'' by both

Surveyors had illegally extended her parapet wall from the eastern and

western boundaries of her lot up to the sea shore while the scheme inquiry

was pending. The observations of Mr. Mendis at page 387 of the record

are as follows:

1481 The record further indicates that the DistTict Court by order dated

01.05.200 I had issued an iqjunction against the r Defendant restraining

her Ii-om making any constructions within the corpus while the Plaintill

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle P/ I0953

had also been prevented from making consb-uctions within the corpus of

the action. (Vide- order at page 203 of the record).

1491 It is absolutely clear that there is no merit in the submission that the

road marked "N" cannot be fUither widened to provide a proper roadway

to lot "K" when there were no permanent constmctions whal~oever, in the

corpus beyond buildings refeITed to in Plan No. 150A or Plan No. 2207. It

is further seen that none of the buildings referred to in both Plans will be

allected by widening the road marked" T" for the purpose of providing a

proper road to lot "K".

1501 It is not in dispute that the road to the East of tJle corpus is a public

road and the learned DistrictJudge who inspected tJle land on 09.09.1999

had clearly observed tJlat it is appropriate for the Plaintilf to be given a

road along the southern boundary in equal extent to the public road on the

Ea.st (Vide- notes dated 09.09.1999).

1511 I am of the opinion that it is not just and reasonable under such

circumstances, to provide the Plaintiff' with a 3 feet ~\~de footpath to reach

ker lot "K" which is threatended by sea erosion due to its location closer to

dle sea shore when none of dle buildings referred to in Plan No. 150A

marked "Z" or Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" would be affected by the

widening of the road marked "N" along the southern boundary of the

corpus.

1521 It IS well settled dlat appellate court would not be justified in

interfering with the domain of dle fact-findings authority of dle Trial.Iudge

unless the same is /ound to be unreasonable or perverse. In HB. CaJldlll;

1541 I agree that Ule learned Additional District.J udge was justified in

holding that t11e Defendants who occupy the buildings which are adjacent

to each other should be provided with the road marked "N" to enter the

public road fj-OITI t11e rear portion of their lots as depicted in Plan No.

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

2207. However, I am of the opinion that his finding that the Plaintiff must

also be given the same 3 feet wide footpath marked "N" as suggested in

Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" is wrong, unacceptable, unreasonable and

against the weight of evidence and thus, that part of the order would be

amenable to judicial scrutiny.

1551 Having regard to all the special circumstances enumerated above,

including the extent of the land which is comparatively small in extent (48

perches), it is just and reasonable to expand the road marked "N" in Plan

o. 2207 marked "Y" and make it a 7 feet wide road to be used in

common from the entry point of the public road on the E.ast of the corpus

upto the entry point of lot "K" as depicted in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" to

enable the Plaintiff to reach the public road to the East from lot "K".

1561 I am of the view that the remaining part of the road marked "N" from

the entry point of lot "K" upoto lot "A" depicted in Plan No. 2207 marked

"Y" shall remain unch;mged as a 3 teet wide road to enable the other

parties to use of the said 3 feet road after connecting with the said 7 feet

wide road from entry point of lot "K" to reach the public road to the East.

Validity of the Petition filed by the Plaintiff

1571 Before I part with this order, I wish to deal with the submission made

by Mr. Sahabandu that there is no question of law or fact that has been

raised by the Plaiintiff in the Petition dated 23.07.2003 and the only relief

prayed for by the Plaintiff was the stay order and therefore there is no valid

appeal before Court. The contention of Mr. Sahabandu was that the basic

of attack on the order in question Gmnot be seen fi'om the Petition and

therefore, the Petition shall be dismissed in himiJe. A perusal of the

Petition of Appeal dated 25.07.2003 reveals dlat the Plaintiff in her

Petition had prayed for the following reliefs:

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle PII0953

,

I. issue notice on the Hespondents;

2. grant leave to appeal;

3. set aside the order dated 11.07.2003;

4. accept and confirm the scheme of partition contained in Plan 150A

dra\\~1 by W.Weerasinghe, Licensed Surveyor and Court

Commissioner dated 2:-3.()7.199H;

5. reject the scheme of paTtition contained in Plan 2027 drawn by M.C.

Mendis, Licensed Surveyor dated 19.05.200 I;

G. issue a stay order directing the leaTned Diistrict Judge not to

implement the partititon of the land in D.C. Galle PI 0953 till the

linal determination of this application; and

7. for cost~.

15HI The Plaintitl in paragraphs !i of the Petition has stated that in Plan No.

2027 marked "ll", road access has been given to the sea shore as the sea

shore is the common boundary to all the allotments whereas in Plan No.

I!iOA marked "A", one common road access is !,riven to all allotments from

the main Galle-Matara Hoad to the sea shore to save land as far as possible

as the corpus is comparatively small in extent.

1591 Section 758 of the Ci\~l Procedure Code set~ out the content, of a

petition of appeal and provides in sub-paragTaph (e) as follows:

"(e). a plain and concise statement of the !,'Tounds of objection to

the judgment, decree or order appealed against such

statement to be set fOlth in duly numbered paragTaphs".

1601 It seems to me that dlere is no specilic paragraph which has dealt wid!

dIe main attack on the order except dIe above-mentioned paragraph 5 and

the relief by which the Plaintilf is seeking to set aside the order in question,

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle PI1 0953

reject the scheme of partition contained in Plan No. 2027 and accept the

scheme of partition contained in Plan No. 150A. It appears that there is an

omission or defecl on the part of the Plaintiff in complying with section

758(1) (e) of the Civil Procedure Code.

1611 The question now is whether such omission or defect on the part of

the Palintiff in complying with section sub-section (I) of section 758 has

materially prejudiced the Respondents before Court. Section 759 (I) of the

Civil Procedure Code provides that if the petition of appeal is not drawn

up in the manner set out in section 758 of the Civil Procedure Code, it

may be rejected or be returned to the appellant for the purpose of being

amended within a time to be fixed by the court or amended then and

there. However, section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as

follows:

"In dle case Of";Ul)1 mistaKe, omission or defect on dle Palt Of"allY appellant IiI complYliIg with dle plVvisions of"dle foregoing sections, the COUlt of" Appeal may, II" it should be ot opliuon dlat the respondent has not been matenaJly prt;iudiced, grant relieton sudl tenn.5 as it may deed just':

1621 Section 759(2) gives the Court of Appeal the discretion to grant relief

in the case of a mistake, omission or defect in complying with the

provisions of the foregoing sections which include both section 754, which

deals with appeals from a judgment or a decree of an original COUlt and

section 756 which deals with applications for leave to appeal

(TlJllagaratJlaln v. E(hi1~"Jilghe 1982 (I) Sri LR 56). Thus, section 759(2)

only enables relief to be given in the case of imy mistake, omission or

defect on the part of any appellant in complying witil Ule provisions of tile

foregoing sections (section 754 relating to appeals and 756 relating to leave

to appeal).

L TA0272/2003 D.C. Galle PI ) 0953

I

1631 Reliels under section 759(2) can he !"Tanted when the following Lwo

mandatory elements are satislied:

J. Any mistake, omission or defect has occurred on the part of any

appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections;

and

2. The respondent has not been materially prejudiced hy the said

mistake, omission or defect.

1641 Thus, it is actually for the Court to lind out whether any mistake,

omission or defect Lhat had occurred in complying with the foregoing

provisions of Lhe Civil Procedure Code and then, lind out whether it has

materially prejudiced the RespondenL~ in the case. As the power of the

Court of Appeal to grant relief under section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code is wide and discretionary, relief may be granted even if no excuse lor

non-compliance is forthcoming provided however, that the Court of

Appeal is of the opinion that the Respondent has not been materially

prejudiced (Nanayillara v Wanalwla.lDonYa (J 993) 2 Sri LR. 289).

1651 In the case ol1ayasekera v. [..i,kmilli (20 1 0) I Sri LR 41, Ekanayake.J. held that:

"lrdle i,sue at hand lid/I widJJil dIe purview ora mista.ke, omi'ision or defecl all dIe prut oFdle Appel/ant Iii complpil/,{ wldl the pIVvisions of sectioll 7..'1.5, and IF dIe Court of Appeal is of dIe opIiJJOIJ dlat dIe Respondent has not beell mateIiaJly prc;/udicerl, it i, empowered to grant relierlo dIe appellallt Oil such tenns as it deemed just ...

1661 This appeal was filed in 200:~ and the case is pending in the Court of

Appeal lor the last 17 ye;u-s. The Respondents had not il1\~ted this COUIt

at the initial stage of this appeal to dismiss this appeal on the ground tJlaL

the Plaintiff had failed to comply with sub-section (I) of section 758 of the

Civil Procedure Code and that the RespondcnL~ had been materially

L TA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle P/I 0953

prejudiced by such failure. No submission was made at the hearing or

argument that the Respondents had been materially prejudiced by the

failure of the Plaintiff to comply with sub-section (l) of section 758 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

1671 It is crystal clear that the Respondents have not shown that they had

been materially prejudiced by the said omission or defect in the Petition in

not complying with sub-seclion (I) of section 758 of the Civil Procedure

Code. This COUIt called for the original case recorsd from the District

Court, heard both Counsel, perused the original case record and found

lhat the part of the order of the learned Additional District Judge as

rel,rards the failure to provide a proper roadway to the Plaintiff is

unacceptable, unreasonable and ag-ainst the weight of the evidence and

hence, the Plaintiff is entitled to a Palt of tile relief sought by her in her

Petition subject however, to specific directions.

1681 Having considered tile special circumstances alld in the absence of any

material that the Respondents had been materially pr~iudiced by such

ommission or defect in the Petition, I am of the view that tile present

appeal falls witllin the scope of section 759(2) of tile Civil Procedure Code.

1691 For those reaons, the question of law formulated on 12.06.2020 is

answered as follows:

I. The order of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle in

accepting tile part of the scheme of partition suggested by Mr. C.

Mendis as contained in Plan No. 2027 mal'ked "Y" as reg-ards tile

adjustment of the II- Defendant's lot "8", shifting the Plaintiffs lot

"K" to the West of tile corpus and giving a 3 feet wide road marked

"N" to be used by the parties who occupy buildings adjacent to each

LTA-0272/2003 D.C. Galle PII 0953

I

other to reach the public road to the East is in conleJrmity with the

amended interlocutory decree and is just and reasonable;

2. The other part of the order of the learned Additional Dist.rictJudge

in providing only 3 feet wide road to the Plaintitl's lot. "K' as

depicted in Plan No. 2027 marked "Y" made by Mr. C. Mendis is

unacceptable, unreasonable and is ag-ainst the weight of t.he e\~dence

and that part of the order is amenable lor judicial scrunity.

Conclusion

1701 For those reasons, the learned District Judge of Galle is directed to

reter the Commissioner's Plan No. 150A marked "Z" to the

Commissioner to modify his Plan No. 150A sul~iect to the the following

directions and prep;ue the scheme of partition felr the purpose of entering

the final decree accordingly.

I. Lot "B" I,>iven to the 11 ' Detendant shall be confined to 1.4 perches

and shall be adjusted as depcited in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y";

2. The Plaintiffs lot "K" in extent of 7 perches shall be adjusted by

shifting it to t.he western part of the land as a separate lot as depicted

in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" made by Mr. C. Mendis, Licensed

Surveyor;

3. The road marked "N" in Plan No. 2207 made by Mr. C. Mendis,

Licensed Surveyor shall be widened by making it a 7 leet wide road

Ii-om the ent.ry point. of the public road to the East of the corpus

upto the entry point of the adjusted lot "K" to be used by all the

parties as a common road to reach the public road to the East. The

extent. of t.he lots "F", "G", "H" and''./'' shall be adjust.ed

proportionately lor the purpose of widening the said road marked

L TA-027212003 D.C. Galle P/l 0953

"N" in Plan No. 2027 marked "Y" to be a 7 feet wide road as

aforesaid;

4. The remaining part of the road marked "N" fi'om the entry point of

the adjusted lot "K" to the entry point of lot "A" in Plan No. 2207

marked "Y shall remain unchanged as a 3 feet wide roadway as

depicted in Plan No. 2207 marked "Y" to enable the oLher palties to

use the said 3 leet \~~de roadway to reach the public road to the East

by connecting \~th the 7 feet wide road as directed in this order.

1711 The order of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dated

11.07.2003 in part which is inconsistent \~th this order is set aside. Subject

the above mentioned directions, the appeal is partly allowed. The parties

shall bear their own costs.

1721 The Registrar is directed to forward the original case record together

with a copy of this oreler to the District] udge of Galle.
