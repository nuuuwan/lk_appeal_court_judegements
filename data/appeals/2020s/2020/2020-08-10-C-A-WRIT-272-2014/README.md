Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

Two issues arise for determination in this application. The first is whether

the recommendation made by the 10th Respondent that a land belonging to

the Petitioner be acquired by the 1st Respondent, Peoples Bank (the Bank)

under and in terms of Part VIII of the Finance Act No. 11 of 1963, as

amended by the Finance and Ceylon State Mortgage Bank (Amendment) Law

No. 16 of 1973, the Finance (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 1984 and the

Finance (Amendment) Act No. 36 of 2000 (collectively referred to the Act), is

contrary to the provisions of the Act and/or irrational and arbitrary. The

second issue is whether the Bank has complied with the mandatory

provisions of Section 71(4) of the Act.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 11th Respondent had been the owner of an agricultural land in extent of

1A 2R. It is admitted between the parties that the 11th Respondent executed

a conditional transfer of the said land to the Petitioner by Deed of Transfer

No. 453 dated 21st December 2000, with the condition being that if a sum of

Rs. 114,000 is paid by the 11th Respondent to the Petitioner within one year

of the date of execution of the said Deed, the Petitioner would re-transfer

the said land to the 11th Respondent. With the re-transfer not having taken

place, the 11th Respondent made an application to the Bank in 2006 moving

that the said land be acquired by the Bank.

The power of the Bank to acquire private lands at the request of persons

who are in circumstances such as the 11th Respondent has been set out in

Part VIII of the said Act titled The acquisition by the Peoples Bank of certain

premises and the disposal of such premises. Part VIII consists of Sections 69

5

91, with Sections 71 and 72 being of particular application to the issues

before this Court.

Section 71 (1) authorises the Bank to acquire the whole or any part of any

agricultural, residential or business premises which were sold or transferred

in the circumstances contemplated in sub-paragraphs (a) - (d) thereof.

Paragraph (d) of Section 71(1), which is the sub-paragraph applicable to this

application, reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), the Bank is hereby

authorised to acquire the whole or any part of any agricultural,

residential or business premises, if the Bank is satisfied that those

premises were, at any time before or after the appointed date but not

earlier than the first day of January, 1952-

(d) transferred by the owner of such premises to any other person

after receiving from such other person a sum of money as

consideration for such transfer and upon the condition that, on the

repayment by the transferor (hereafter in this Part of this Act

referred to as the "original owner") of that sum with or without

interest thereon within a specified period, such other person will

re-transfer those premises to the original owner.

Once the initial threshold in Section 71(1) is met, Section 71(2) of the Act

sets out several conditions that the Peoples Bank must be satisfied of, if it is

to acquire a property falling within Section 71(1)(d). Section 71(2) reads as

follows:1

No premises shall be acquired under subsection (1):

1 Section 71(2)(b) has been repealed by Amendment Act No. 19 of 1984.

6

(a) unless an application in that behalf has been made to the Bank by

the original owner of such premises or, where such original owner

is dead or is of unsound mind or otherwise incapable of acting, by

the spouse or any descendant of such person, or if there is no

surviving spouse or descendant of such person, by a parent,

brother or sister of such person; or

(aa) unless such application is made within ten years -

(i) Not applicable

(ii) Not applicable

(iii) from the date of the expiry of the specified period referred to

in paragraph (d) of subsection (1); or

(c) unless the Bank is satisfied that the average statutory income of

the person making the application and of the other members of the

family of which he is the head, computed under the provisions of

the written law relating to the imposition of income tax, for the

three years of assessment immediately preceding the date on

which such application was made by him, does not exceed a sum of

one hundred thousand rupees; or

(d) if the Bank is satisfied that the premises to which the application

relates are reasonably required for occupation as a residence for

the owner of those premises or any member of the family of such

owner or for the purposes of any trade, business, profession,

vocation or employment of such owner or any member of his

family and that such owner or member of his family has no other

7

premises which could be used for the purpose for which the

premises to which the application relates are being used; or

(e) unless, in the case of an application relating to any agricultural

premises, the Bank is satisfied that the applicant is not the owner

of any other agricultural premises exceeding ten acres in extent.

For the purposes of paragraph (d) of this subsection, "member of the

family", when used in relation to any person means the spouse of that

person or any son or daughter of that person over eighteen years of

age, or any parent, brother or sister dependent on that person.

The 11th Respondent had made an application under the provisions of Part

VIII of the Act to the Bank on 25th August 2006. A copy of the said application

has been marked X2. There is no dispute between the parties that the

application made by the 1st Respondent falls within the provisions of Section

71(1)(d) of the Act and that the Bank was empowered to accept the said

application.

Once an application is made and is accepted by the Bank, the Bank is

required under Section 71(2A) of the Act to issue a prohibitory notice with

respect to the said land, with a copy to the owner of the premises, and to

request the Registrar of Lands to register the said notice in the manner

prescribed in the Registration of Documents Ordinance for the registration

of an instrument affecting or relating to land. There is no dispute that the

Bank complied with this requirement.2

Section 71(3) of the Act provides as follows:

2 Vide letter dated 10th October 2006.

8

The question whether any premises which the Bank is authorized to

acquire under this Part of this Act should or should not be acquired shall

be determined by the Bank and every such determination of the Bank

shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any

court.

The Supreme Court in Kanagasabapathy and Another v. The People's Bank

and two others3 summarised in the following manner the requirements that

the Bank must consider prior to making a determination to acquire a land:

"Basically there are three questions for the decision of the Bank in the

case of an application for redemption, viz.-

(1) Is the land one which the Bank is authorised by Section 71 (1) to

acquire?

(2) If so, does Section 71 (2) restrict the right of the Bank to acquire

the land? and

(3) If not, should the land be acquired?"

Section 71(3) therefore makes it clear that even if the conditions set out in

Section 71(2) have been satisfied, the Bank still has a discretion whether to

make an order for acquisition. This position has been clearly laid down by

the Supreme Court in Atapattu and others vs Peoples Bank and others4

where it was held that, Section 71 does not compel the Bank to acquire

premises simply because the pre-conditions in subsection (2) are

3S.C Application No. 124/75, S.C. Minutes of 27.8.1976; referred to in Emaliyana Perera v. Peoples Bank Land Redemption Department and Others (1987) 1 Sri LR 181 at page 184. 4 (1997) 1 Sri LR 208 at page 220.

9

satisfied, and the fact that the Bank has a discretion has been

recognised in Emaliyana Perera v.Peoples Bank5.

Provisions with regard to the holding of an inquiry have been introduced by

the Finance (Amendment) Act No. 36 of 2000.6 It is agreed between the

parties that the 10th Respondent conducted an inquiry into the said

application where an opportunity was afforded to the Petitioner as well as to

the 11th Respondent to present their respective cases. There is no complaint

with regard to the manner in which the inquiry was conducted.

By an Order delivered on 30th September 2013, marked X3, the 10th

Respondent Inquiry Officer had recommended that a determination be

made by the Board of Directors of the Bank to acquire the property owned

by the Petitioner. As noted above, the question whether any premises which

the Bank is entitled to acquire should or should not be acquired shall be

determined by the Bank. I observe that although the recommendation of the

Inquiry Officer has been filed by the Petitioner, the decision of the Board of

Directors of the Bank has not been tendered to this Court by any of the

parties, including the Bank itself, thereby giving rise to a doubt whether the

Board of Directors of the Bank had in fact made a determination in this

regard.

The consequential steps that the Bank must take once a determination is

made in terms of Section 71(3) are set out in (a) Section 71(4), which would

be discussed later, and (b) Section 72(1) and (2), which reads as follows:

5 (1987) 1 Sri LR 181. 6 Section 71(3A) of the Act reads as follows: for the purposes of making a determination under subsection (3), the Bank shall cause an inquiry to be held into the application by an inquiring officer appointed by the Bank. The inquiring officer appointed by the Bank shall give the owner of the premises to which the application relates and the person making the application, an opportunity of being heard either in person or by an agent authorized in that behalf .

10

(1) Where the Bank has determined that any premises shall be

acquired for the purposes of this Part of this Act, the Chairman of

the Board of Directors of the Bank shall cause such determination

to be notified to the Minister;

(2) Upon being notified of the determination of the Bank in respect of

any premises, the Minister may, by Order (hereafter in this Part of

this Act referred to as a " vesting Order") published in the Gazette,

vest in the Bank, with effect from such date as shall be specified in

the Order, the premises to which such determination relates.

It is not in dispute that the Bank acted in terms of Section 72(1) and that the

Minister of Finance had accordingly proceeded to make a vesting order,

which had been published in the Gazette. I must observe at this stage that

the communication made by the Bank to the Minister, and evidence that the

Minister addressed his mind to the said communication prior to making a

decision in terms of Section 72(2) has not been produced before this Court.

Dissatisfied with the aforementioned (a) recommendation of the Inquiry

Officer, (b) the purported decision of the Bank, and (c) the decision of the

Minister, the Petitioner filed this application seeking inter alia the following

relief:7

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the recommendation of the 10th

Respondent dated 30th September, 2013 marked X3;

2. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Board of Directors of

the Bank to acquire the said land;

7 Vide paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition.

11

3. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the vesting order published by the

Minister.

Before considering the two grounds urged before this Court by the learned

Counsel for th Petitioner, I must state that the Bank must ensure that there

is strict compliance by the applicant of the requirements laid down in

Section 71(1) and 71(2), for the reason that an Order of the Bank to acquire

a property has very serious consequences that affect the proprietary rights

of the owner of the property.

In fact, in Atapattu and Others v. Peoples Bank and Others8, the Supreme

Court made the following observation on the right of redemption provided

in Section 71:

Section 71 creates a (contingent) right of redemption in favour of a

transferor of land. Such a right seriously derogates from the contractual

and proprietary right of the transferee. However, such statutory

interference with common law rights is by no means unique. Sometimes

the law allows one person to enjoy a right in derogation of the legal

rights of another. Thus a beneficiary under an express or constructive

trust has rights in respect of property vested in another because the

statute considers it equitable.

The necessity to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Act was

considered by the Supreme Court in Peoples Bank vs. Hetti Kankanamlage

Gunasingha9 where it was held as follows:

8 Supra. 9 SC Appeal No. 77/15; SC Minutes of 13th July 2017.

12

The Finance Act Part VIII seems to have made special provisions for a

special purpose with regard to the rights of persons who transfer their

land on conditions and failing to perform that condition, lose their land

to others. The law has granted seemingly very special powers to the

Peoples Bank. The procedure is specifically provided and each step in

the course of the way up to taking possession of the land from the

person in whose ownership the land remains, has been laid down. ....

The provisions of law which are mandatory in nature have to be

complied with.

As noted earlier, once the initial threshold set out in Section 71(1)(d) is met,

the Bank must be satisfied of the following four matters, prior to its

discretion to acquire the property is exercised:

1) The application must be made by the original owner of such premises

or, where such original owner is dead or is of unsound mind or

otherwise incapable of acting, by the spouse or any descendant of such

person.

2) The application must be made within ten years from the date of the

expiry of the period specified for the re-transfer to be effected;

3) The average statutory income of the person making the application and

of the other members of the family of which he is the head, computed

under the provisions of the written law relating to the imposition of

income tax, for the three years of assessment immediately preceding

the date on which such application was made by him, does not exceed

One Hundred thousand rupees;

13

4) The premises to which the application relates are not reasonably

required for occupation as a residence for the owner of those premises

or any member of the family.

While there is no dispute with regard to items 1, 2 and 4 above, the

Petitioners first complaint to this Court is that item 3 above, which is a

reiteration of the provisions of Section 71(2)(c), has not been satisfied by the

11th Respondent in that the 11th Respondent has failed to establish that her

income is less than Rs. 100,000/-, and therefore the Inquiry Officer could not

have made a recommendation to acquire the property. It is on this basis that

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the said decision is

illegal and arbitrary.

Section 71(2)(c) requires the Bank to be satisfied that the average statutory

income of the applicant as well as his family, computed under the

provisions of the written law relating to the imposition of income tax, for the

three years of assessment preceding the date of the application, does not

exceed Rupees One Hundred Thousand.

Having examined the Order of the Inquiry Officer (the 10th Respondent)

marked X3, I find that the issue of income has been addressed in the

following manner:

It is not in dispute that the burden of proving that the annual average

income for a period of three years preceding the date of the application to

the Bank must be less than Rs. 100,000, lies with the 11th Respondent.

Together with her application, the 11th Respondent had annexed an Income

Assessment Form issued by the Divisional Secretary, Kuruwita certifying that

her annual income, derived from the cultivation of tea, is Rs. 72,000.10 I have

examined this certificate, and observe that it does not specify a period nor

does it extend to a period of three years. Thus, on this ground alone, the 11th

Respondent had failed to discharge the burden cast on her by Section

71(2)(c).

I have also examined the evidence of the 11th Respondent and observe that

even though the said certificate had specified the source of her income, the

11th Respondent had initially denied having any income other than the

income she had derived from the land in dispute.11 It was only after her

attention was drawn to the said certificate during cross-examination that

she had admitted to the fact that she had an income from the cultivation of

tea on a land belonging to her.12

Furthermore, in terms of Section 71(2)(c), it is not only the income of the

original owner that must be considered, but that of her children who are

over the age of eighteen. The 11th Respondent had admitted that she has

three children, but taken up the position that none of the children are

10 Vide page 153 of the documents annexed to the petition. 11 Vide page 2 of the proceedings of 16th November 2011 at page 56 of the documents annexed to the petition. 12 Vide pages 7 and 8 of the proceedings of 16th November 2011 at pages 61 and 62 of the documents annexed to the petition.

15

employed. However, she had stated that the eldest son is also cultivating tea

on his portion of the land. I am of the view that this income, which had not

been disclosed at the inquiry, must also be taken into account in calculating

the income of the 11th Respondent, a fact that the 10th Respondent who

conducted the inquiry has not given her mind to.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the conclusion of the 10th

Respondent relating to the income of the 11th Respondent is not supported

by the evidence. I am mindful that this Court is exercising its writ jurisdiction

as opposed to its appellate jurisdiction, and to the fact that this Court is not

concerned with the rights and wrongs of the decision, but only whether such

decision is legal or not. However, it is an accepted fact that a Court can

intervene when there is no evidence to support the finding of the

administrative body. This issue has been discussed in Administrative Law by

Wade and Forsyth13 in the following manner:

No evidence does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It

extends to any case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not

reasonably capable of supporting the finding; or where, in other words,

no tribunal could reasonably reach that conclusion on that evidence.

This no evidence principle clearly has something in common with the

principle that perverse or unreasonable action is unauthorised and ultra

vires. It also has some affinity with the substantial evidence rule of

American law, which requires that findings be supported by substantial

evidence on the record as a whole.

In Samarakoon Jayasundera Mudiyanselage Kiri Banda vs. A.H. Irangani

Samaraweera and Others14, this Court held as follows:

13 11th Edition; page 227. 14CA (PHC) 98/2007; CA Minutes of 19th October 2018.

16

Generally, courts exercising judicial review do not review errors of fact

made by administrative bodies/officials, unless those errors of fact are

linked to the assumption of the administrative body's jurisdiction i.e.

jurisdictional errors of facts.15 [R v. Fulham, Hammersmith and

Kensington Rent Tribunal (1951) 2 K. B. 1 at 6; Walter Leo v Land

Commissioner 57 NLR 178]. One exception to this general principle is the

no evidence rule'.

This Court, having referred to the above passage from Wade, went on to

state as follows:

The observations made by the text writers about this ground of judicial

review have been adopted and endorsed by the Supreme Court in

Kiriwanthe v Navaratne [(1990) 2 Sri LR 393 at 409] and in Nalini

Ellegala v Poddalagoda [(1999) 1 Sri LR 46 at 52].

In Hasseen v Gunasekara and others [CA Application No. 128/86 C.A.M.

02.10.1995] this court considered an order of the Rent Board of Review,

affirming an order of the Rent Board which had been "arrived at

without an adequate evaluation of the evidence and by failing to take

into consideration relevant items of evidence which could have

influenced the finding" and held the Rent Board as well as the Board of

Review had "erred in law by failing to take into account relevant items

of evidence in arriving at the finding" and therefore quashed the orders

of the Rent Board as well as of the Board of Review.

15 See Barnett H, Constitutional and Administrative Law, 3rd Edition, Routelege 2014 at page 763 where it is stated that a court will be reluctant to review a non-jurisdictional error of fact because it is presumed that administrative decision makers have all the factual information on hand and are best equipped to make factual determinations.

17

Therefore, when a factual finding by an administrative body is not

supported by the evidence on record, or has been made ignoring

relevant and established evidence on record, the court has the ability to

exercise judicial review.

As pointed out by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister

for the Civil Service16, a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of

logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had

applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it is

both irrational as well as unreasonable.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that (a) the recommendation of

the Inquiry Officer that the property belonging to the Petitioner be acquired

is not supported by the evidence that has been led to satisfy the condition

precedent set out in Section 71(2)(c), and (b) the said decision is therefore

not only irrational, but also illegal. I am therefore of the view that the said

decision is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

The second ground urged before this Court by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner was that once a determination has been made by the Bank in

terms of Section 71(3), it must act in terms of Section 71(4), which the

Petitioner argued has not been complied with.

Section 71(4) reads as follows:

Where the Bank has determined that any premises shall be acquired

for the purposes of this Part of this Act, the Bank shall-

16 [1985] AC 374.

18

(a) Notify such determination to the owner of such premises; and

(b) Cause a notice to be delivered or transmitted to the proper

Registrar of Lands for registration, setting out the prescribed

particulars relating to those premises and stating that those

premises are to be acquired under this Part of this Act.

Every notice under paragraph (b) shall be registered by the Registrar of

Lands in the manner provided in the Registration of Documents

Ordinance for the registration of an instrument affecting or relating to

land and shall be deemed for such purposes to be an instrument

affecting or relating to the premises the prescribed particulars of which

are set out in such notice.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the Bank failed to notify him of the

determination to acquire the property, as required by Section 71(4). The

learned Counsel for the Bank however submitted that the Bank has in fact

sent a notice in terms of Section 71(4), and drew the attention of this Court

to the document dated 10th October 2006.17 However, I observe that this is

the notice of prohibition issued in terms of Section 71(2), and is not a notice

issued under Section 71(4). I must observe that even though the Petitioner

had specifically raised this issue in paragraph 9(ii) of its petition, the Bank,

other than denying this averment, has not filed the notice that it ought to

have sent in terms of Section 71(4) nor has the Peoples Bank satisfied this

Court that it complied with the provisions of Section 71(4). Therefore, I am

of the view that the Bank has failed to comply with the procedure laid down

in Section 71(4) of the Act.

17 Vide page 133 of the documents annexed to the petition.

19

In Ratnasabapathy Thiruarudchelvam vs. Murugupillai Sinnarajah18 this

Court held as follows:

This Court is of the view that compliance with Section 71(4) is a vital

step in the acquisition process stipulated in Part VIII of the Act and that

this is the only opportunity that a person affected by the said

determination would have, of being informed of the reasons for the

decision of the Bank, prior to the Minister making a vesting order in

terms of Section 72. As held by Lord Diplock, susceptibility to judicial

review under the head 'procedural impropriety' covers the failure by an

administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly

laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is

conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of

natural justice.19 Therefore, non-compliance with such a step would

render the entire process illegal and liable to be quashed by way of a

Writ of Certiorari.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that this is a fit case in which

the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution

should be exercised.

Accordingly, I issue a Writ of Certiorari in terms of paragraph (b) of the

prayer to the petition, quashing the decision of the 10th Respondent marked

X3 and the Vesting Order applicable to the property in question, marked

X6. The 1st Respondent Bank shall accordingly take steps to cancel the

prohibitory notice, and any other notice that has been registered by the

Bank in respect of the said land.
