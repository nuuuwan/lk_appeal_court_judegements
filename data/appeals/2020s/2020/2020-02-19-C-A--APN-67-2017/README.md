This is an appeal against a revision order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Tangalle dated 06.04.2017.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the claimant respondent petitioner filed this instant appeal.

The instant appeal is only with regard to the order of the inquiry of the vehicle bearing No. 57-3925 under section 431(1) of the CPC.

Both counsel appeared for both claimants, the petitioner and the I st respondent agreed to dispose this case by way of written submissions already filed. The learned DSG appearing for the Attorney General informed that he was not filing written submissions.

The 1 Sl claimant petitioner respondent (here in after referred to as the I Sl Respondent) claiming the van bearing No. 57-3925, Chaminda Lal has made a complaint to the special investigation Bureau Tangalle. He has stated that this particular vehicle was advertised by him in Lankadeepa newspaper for sale. Accordingly one Jayantha Abeysekera has called the I sl Claimant Respondent and requested him to exchange an Alto car bearing No. NCKO 9606 said to have been belonged to him. Thereby the 1 sl complainant agreed to exchange the vehicles and handed over his van to Jayantha Abeysekera. At that time the registered owner of the van was one P.A.Nimal Dharmasiri. Chaminda Lal exchanged the van with open papers to said Jayantha Abeysekera without any money transaction.(according to evidence of IP Gunapala, at pg 142 , MC proceedings) All the documents related to the van were handed over to Jayantha Abeysekera. Later the 1 sl complainant, Chaminda Lal had come to know that the documents relating to the Alto car were forged and there after Charninda Lal has made a complaint to the Special Investigation Beauru Tangalle. Accordingly facts were reported to MC Tangalle, charges were framed under

4

sections 454,457,403,389 and 386 but the investigating officers were unable to apprehend the suspect. After investigation the Alto car was handed over to the genume owner.

There is no dispute with regard to the registered owner of the van and the transaction was up to Chaminda Lal, the Petitioner of the instant case. According to Ameer he has bought the said vehicle from one leewantha (receipt is marked as Rl was produced in MC without a date).

Ameer claimed that he bought the vehicle by a person called leewantha Kumara and on the same day he claimed that he bought the vehicle from Geeth, but at the time of the MC inquiry non of them were present and those two appeared to be non existing.

Therefore with regard to the ownership of the van bearing No.57-3925 IS m doubt.

Therefore it is evident that the transaction of the van to Ameer is not genuine.

Anyhow there after Ameer sold the vehicle to one lagath Wijenayake from Akurana and Ameer has taken the van back from lagath Wijenayake and produced in MC on request of the investigating officer. After an Inquiry under sec. 431 (I ) of the CPC learned Magistrate has handed oyer the possession of the above mentioned vehicle to Ameer, the petitioner in the instant case. Now Chaminda Lal and Ameer both are claiming for the vehicle.

Being aggrieved by the above mentioned order of the Learned Magistrate, the original complainant Chaminda Lal made a revision application to the Provincial High Court of Tangalle where the order was reversed by the learned High Court Judge deciding in favour of the Chaminda Lal, the 1

51 Complainant Petitioner, 1

51 Respondent of the instant Appeal.

The Petitioner Ameer has filed this instant appeal against the above mentioned revision application.

Since the instant appeal is only with regard to the inquiry held under sec 431(1) of the CPC, this court will have to consider only the legality of the above mentioned order of both the High Court and the MC and not the main case of Cheating pending in MC. It is very clear that the vehicle was produced in MC by Ameer which was sold to leewantha by himself. According to the proceedings of MC, it is understood that Ameer has bought the vehicle from non-existing persons, but up to Chaminda Lal, transactions are clear.

Therefore it is evident that Chaminda Lal is a genuine buyer but not Ameer. The substantive case with regard to the Alto car is still pending in MC where Chaminda Lal is the virtual complainant. The registered owner of the van never claimed the vehicle since the chain of possession was transferred up to Chaminda Lal was taken place by legal means. Therefore it is amply demonstrated by Chaminda Lal that his chain of custody is genuine and he got caught to the fictitious person who exchanged the van to Alto car.

At the 431(1) inquiry, the Learned Magistrate has considered following cases. Sugathapala Vs. Thambiraja (67 NLR 91), Punchi Nona Vs. Hinni Appu (60 NLR 518) and Balagalle Vs. Somaratne (70 NLR 382).

Learned High Court Judge has consideI;ed Silva and Another Vs. OlC Thambuththegama (19912 SLR 83). In the case of Silva and Another Vs. OlC Thambuththegama, Hon. S.N.Silva J. by citing Section 431(1) and (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, has mentioned that it provides discretion to the Magistrate to decide on a vehicle inquiry under the above mentioned Section as follows:-

" Subsection (1) deals with three categories of property seized by a police officer, namely:

(I) property taken under section 29 of the Code relating to the search of persons who are arrested;

(2) property alleged or suspected to have been stolen,

(3) property found under circumstances which create a suspicion of the commission of any offence."

S.N.Silva J. further mentioned that there are obvious limitations to its general application since there is a likelihood of delivering a property to a person having no legal right to have possession but obtained through criminal means.

Further mentioned that this observation is consistent with the current trend of India by citing following passage from Sohoni's The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, 18th Edition, 1986 p4839, as elaborated by Justice S.N.Silva in the above mentioned judgement.

"But in determining who is entitled to possession, actual possession of the property may be a relevant factor, but not conclusive. The words "entitled" to the possession of the property" are not to be equated with actual possession or with the expression "the person from whom the property is seized or taken".

Where it is proved that the person from whose possession the property was seized came by it dishonestly, the Magistrate may have to consider the question of title. But where the person from whose possess ion the property was seized is not shown to have committed any offence in relation to that property which means he was lawfully in possession, he would be entitled to possession"

Therefore on the basis of above reasoning, it is very clear that the vehicle should be given to the genuine owner, lst Respondent Chaminda La!. Therefore there is no reason to interfere with the correct decision of the Learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the order of the Learned High Court Judge is affirmed.

Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
