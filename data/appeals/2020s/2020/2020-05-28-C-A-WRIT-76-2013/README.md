ThePetitionersareseekingawritofcertiorariquashingtheordermadebythe1stRespondent,

Minister ofLands and Land Development dated 04.12.2012 under section 38(a) of the Land

Acquisition Act as amended (Land Acquisition Act) directing the 2nd Respondent to take

possession of the Petitioner's land, which had been published in Government Gazette No.

1787/38dated07.12.2012(X10).

In the initial written submissions filed on 13.12.2018, the Petitioners seek to assail the said

orderonthefollowinggrounds:

(a)Thereexistsnourgencytoacquirethesaidlandsandthesaidorderisultraviresthe

powersofthe1stRespondentvestedinhimbysection38(a)oftheLandAcquisitionAct.

(b)The said order had been mala fide and for a collateral purpose namely to politically

(c)Thesaidorderisgrosslyunreasonableinviewofthefactsandcircumstancesrelatingto

the matter as referred to above and is therefore ultra vires the powers of the 1st

Respondent.

The Petitioners appear to have changed the stance in the written submissions filed on

16.09.2019andhavesoughttoassailtheorderX10onthefollowinggrounds:

(a)Thereisnopublicpurposeinlawandinfact.

Suppressionand/orMisrepresentationofMaterialFacts

ItisestablishedlawthatdiscretionaryreliefwillberefusedbyCourtwithoutgoingintothe

in this context to refer to the following passage from the judgment of Pathirana J in W. S.

AlphonsoAppuhamyv.Hettiarachchi[77N.L.R.131at135,6]:

This principle has been consistently applied by courts in writ applications as well.

3rd Respondent for the purpose of constructing a vehicle park, children's park and an

auditorium. The land owners including some of the Petitioners protested and made

However, the proposal to acquire these lands was moved by the Chairman of the 3rd

Respondent on 15.11.1999 which was seconded by Member of the Pradeshiya Sabha M.S.

Abdul Caffor (3R1). The proposal was unanimously approved with all 13 members voting in

Thesewordsareapplicabletothiscaseaswell.TheMawanellaDevelopmentPlanpreparedby

The 3rd Respondent submitted that in acquiring the property of the Petitioners it was also

intended to construct a playground of about 4 acres. The reason given is that there are

approximately15,000studentsenrolledattheMayurapadaNationalSchool,ZahiraNational

School,BaduriyaMuslimSchoolandfiveotherschoolswithintheMawanellatownlimits.But

whethertoissuewritsofCertiorariandMandamus.ThismeansEnglishcommonlawprinciples

[SirisenaCoorayv.TissaDiasBandaranayake(1999)1Sri.L.R.1at1415)].

English Courts have considered the conduct of the Petitioner in deciding whether to grant

discretionary relief by way of judicial review. A ratepayer was denied a remedy to quash a

refusal to make a refund of rates because of his previous deliberate and unjustifiable

withholdingofratesowed[DorotPropertiesLtd.v.LondonBoroughofBrent(1990)C.O.D.378].

A local authority which pursued pointless litigation was denied any remedy [Windsor and

MaidenheadRoyalBCv.BrandroseInvestmentsLtd.(1983)1W.L.R.509].Alocalcouncilwhich

sought to challenge ministerial confirmation of its own proposals for reorganising schools,

AsIhaveadvertedtoearlier,thePetitionersweresuccessfulinthwartingtheacquisitionin
