Before: Janak De Silva J.

N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

Counsel:

Manohara De Silva P.e. with A. Wickremanayake for the Petitioner

Anusha Fernando DSG for 1't to 26th Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioner on 29.10.2018

1't to 26th Respondents on 19.10.2018

Argued on: 28.06.2019

Decided on: 31.01.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was at all times material to this application a Professor attached to

the Arts Faculty of the University of Peradeniya as a lecturer in History. He has

sought the following relief from Court:

(a) A mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision/s of the

1st and/or 2nd Respondents as reflected in documents marked Pll and P17;

(b) A mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the

1st and/or 2nd to 26th Respondents to deduct one month's salary from the

Petitioner's Provident Fund account as evinced by documents marked

P18(a), P18(b) and P18(c) in breach of Section 94 of the Universities Act No.

16 of 1978 as amended .

(c) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus mandating the 1st and/or 2nd

to 26th Respondents to return to the Petitioner with legal interest the

deduction made from the Petitioner's Provident Fund account as evinced by

documents marked P18(a), P18(b) and P18(c),

(d) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

1't and/or 2nd to 26th Respondents refusing to award Emeritus Professorship

to the Petitioner arrived at during 391st meeting of the Council (vide P24),

(e) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of mandamus compelling the 1't and/or 2nd

to 26th Respondents to award Emeritus Professorship to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner applied for and obtained vacation leave from the University to serve

as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) [2R2(a)].

In that communication the Petitioner held out that he will not be receiving any

financial remuneration for this work [2R1(a) and 2R1(b)].

The SLBFE later informed that the Petitioner was paid a basic salary for the period

June 2005 to November 2005. He was paid Rs. 35,000/= for June and July whereas

he was paid a sum of Rs. 85,000/= for the balance period [2R4(b)]. He was also paid

a salary by the 1't Respondent for the same period [2R4(a)]. The Auditor General

claimed that this was contrary to law [2R5].

The 1st Respondent appointed a Committee of three (3) persons to investigate into

this matter. The majority concluded that the conduct of the Petitioner is unethical

[P19]. Consequently, the Council of the 1st Respondent decided to recover the

salary paid to the Petitioner for the period January to July 2005 [Pl1] which was

later amended to limit its application to June 2005 [P17]. Accordingly, steps were

taken to recover the salary paid in June 2005 and to return the deductions from

January to May 2005 [P18(a), (b) and (c)] . The Petitioner is challenging these

decisions and also seeking to impugn the decision of the 1st Respondent not to

award the title of Professor Emeritus to the Petitioner.

The unmeritorious conduct of the Petitioner looms large on the facts of the case.

The Petitioner does not contest the fact that he has informed the 1't Respondent

he will not be receiving any financial remuneration for this work [2R1(a) and

2R1(b)]. However, the Petitioner seeks to deny that he made a similar

representation to the line Ministry of the SLBFE. He strenuously submitted that the

contents in the Cabinet Memorandum [P6(a)] and letter written by the then

Secretary of the line Ministry [P14] to the effect that the Petitioner will not be

receiving any payment from the 1't Respondent for the said period is not something

he made.

Even if the denial of the Petitioner is accepted, the uncontested fact is that the

Petitioner informed the 1st Respondent that he will not be receiving any financial

remuneration for this work at SLBFE when in fact he did receive such remuneration.

The Petitioner claims that the decision to deduct moneys from his Provident Fund

account was arrived at in breach of the rules of natural justice.

In terms of Article 140 of the Constitution this Court must act "according to law" in

deciding whether to issue writs of Certiorari and Mandamus. This means English

common law principles [Sirisena Cooray v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake (1999) 1 Sri.

L. R. 1 at 14-15)].

English Courts have considered the conduct of the Petitioner in deciding whether

to grant discretionary relief by way of judicial review. A ratepayer was denied a

remedy to quash a refusal to make a refund of rates because of his previous

deliberate and unjustifiable withholding of rates owed [Dorot Properties Ltd. v.

London Borough of Brent (1990) C.O.D. 378]. A local authority which pursued

pointless litigation was denied any remedy [Windsor and Maidenhead Royal BC v.

Brandrose Investments Ltd. (1983) 1 W.L.R. 509]. A local council which sought to

challenge ministerial confirmation of its own proposals for re-organising schools,

relying on their own procedural error was denied relief [R. v. Secretary of State for

Education and Science ex. P. Birmingham City Council (1985) 83 L.G.R. 79].

Our Courts have adopted this approach and withheld relief due to the

unmeritorious conduct of the Petitioner even where there has been a clear

violation of natural justice [Wickremasinghe v. Ceylon Electricity Board and Another

{1982} 2 SrLL.R. 607].

I hold that the conduct of the Petitioner as an academic of repute is unmeritorious

in misrepresenting that he will not be receiving any financial remuneration for work

at the SLBFE and that such conduct is sufficient for this Court to deny him any

discretionary relief.

For all the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000/=.
