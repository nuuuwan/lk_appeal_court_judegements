Argued on: 29.07.2020

Decided on: 18.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 6th Respondent consumer purchased a car from the

Petitioner company. During the warranty period, she complained

to the 1st Respondent Consumer Affairs Authority about defects

in the vehicle and sought the intervention of the latter to get a

refund of her payment. The 1st Respondent initiated an inquiry

into the complaint.

At the inquiry held on 13.10.2015, as admitted in paragraph 25

of the petition, the Petitioner agreed to repair and obtain a

valuation report within a week from the date on which the 6th

Respondent hands over the vehicle to the Petitioner. The vehicle

had been accordingly handed over to the Petitioner on or around

13.10.2015. The further inquiry was fixed for 26.10.2015.

Admittedly, the Petitioner did not participate in the further

inquiry on 26.10.2015 but the 6th Respondent did. The

Petitioner did not inform the 1st Respondent of its inability to

participate in the inquiry. No explanation was given prior to the

inquiry even, at least, by telephone. In the result, the 1st

Respondent made the impugned ex parte Order marked P14(b)

dated 26.10.2015 whereby the Petitioner was directed to refund

the full purchase price to the 6th Respondent. It is relevant to

note that the vehicle was with the Petitioner at that time.

P14(b) was sent to the Petitioner with P14(a) dated 20.07.2016

whereby the Petitioner was requested to refund the said money

within thirty days of the date of P14(a).

5

Thereafter the Petitioner sent P15(a) dated 29.07.2016 to the 1st

Respondent seeking to vacate the ex parte Order P14(b) and refix

the inquiry.

This application to vacate the ex parte Order was rejected by the

1st Respondent by P17 dated 29.09.2016. In P17, it was further

informed that proceedings would be instituted in terms of

section 13(6) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act to recover

the money payable to the 6th Respondent, as the Petitioner had

failed to comply with the directive of the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner filed this application on 09.12.2016 seeking to

quash P14(a) and P14(b) by a writ of certiorari and to restrain

the 1st Respondent by a writ of prohibition from taking steps to

institute proceedings in the Magistrates Court in furtherance of

the said impugned Orders.

Let me first address the pivotal point raised by the Petitioner at

the argument.

There is no dispute that the quorum for any meeting of the 1st

Respondent shall be four members.

The Petitioner submits that there was no quorum of the 1st

Respondent to make the impugned Order P14(b) and therefore

the Order has no force in law.

The Petitioner also says that P14(b) was not signed by any

member of the 1st Respondent. I presume the Petitioner takes

up this point in order to emphasise that there was no quorum.

6

The Petitioner further says this position was taken up in

paragraph 30 of the petition.

I am not inclined to agree that the Petitioner took up the

position in the petition that the impugned Order P14(b) is void

due to a lack of quorum. The Petitioner did not take up such a

position even in its counter affidavit.

Paragraph 30 of the petition reads thus:

Physically annexed only to the said purported directive

[P14A], was a purported order/inquiry report [P14B]

prepared by 2nd, 3rd 4th and 5th Respondents, which most

significantly, was backdated or adjusted to 26th October

2015, i.e. the date of further inquiry, which was unsigned,

and strangely had been copied to the 6th Respondent but

not to the Petitioner.

Whether or not there was a lack of quorum is not a pure

question of law. It is firstly a question of fact, which, if proved,

becomes a question of law. It is unfair by the 1st Respondent

and the 6th Respondent for the Petitioner to take up such a

position for the first time at the argument. Had such a position

been taken up either in the petition or at least in the counter

affidavit, the 1st Respondent would have had the opportunity to

respond to it with supporting documents. When it is taken up

at the argument for the first time, that opportunity is lost to the

1st Respondent. There is no admission on the part of the 1st

Respondent that there was a lack of quorum. There is no clear

evidence for this Court to come to a firm conclusion that there

was no quorum. This is made clear by paragraph 5(3) of the

7

written submission of the Petitioner itself, filed after the

argument, wherein the Petitioner says the Respondents have

studiously steered clear of annexing any inquiry report that had

been duly signed. It is settled law that this Court in exercising

writ jurisdiction cannot decide disputed questions of fact for

obvious reasons.

In Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC v. Consumer Affairs

Authority in Sri Lanka,1 I quashed the decision of the Consumer

Affairs Authority on the basis of lack of quorum as the Petitioner

in the said case explicitly took up that position in a separate

averment in the petition, to which the Respondent Consumer

Affairs Authority replied by way of a separate averment in the

statement of objections that one of the members of the panel of

inquiry had stepped out and was not present when the

settlement, which was later converted to a formal Order, was

recorded. The explanation of the Respondent being legally

unacceptable, I held that there was a lack of quorum. The case

at hand is not comparable.

Similarly, in Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority

of Sri Lanka,2 which I cited in the said Judgment in coming to

my decision, the objection of lack of quorum had been taken up

in the petition and was answered in the statement of objections

of the Respondent.

It seems to me the position in KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited v.

Consumer Affairs Authority,3 the case cited by the Petitioner, is

also the same.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I take the view that

the Petitioner cannot take up the issue of lack of quorum for the

first time at the argument.

This leads me to consider the contention of the Petitioner that

the impugned decision P14(b) is unsigned and therefore invalid.

Although the Petitioner in paragraph 30 of the petition says in

passing that P14(b) was unsigned, the Petitioner did not tender

the full document of P14(b) to substantiate this claim. I use the

words in passing because the Petitioner does not take up the

clear position that P14(b) is unsigned and therefore a nullity in

the forefront of the petition. The Petitioner tendered only two

pages of P14(b) with the petition. In short, the Petitioner did not

attach the unsigned part of the said document with the petition.

Thereafter the Petitioner tendered a six-page document as P14(b)

with the motion dated 17.01.2017. In that document, on pages

five and six under signed by, four names are mentioned but

without signatures in the relevant places. The four names

include the Chairman of the 1st Respondent. However,

according to paragraph (e) of the prayer to the petition, P14(b)

was signed by the Chairman of the 1st Respondent. The position

of the Petitioner is not clear.

Although the Petitioner in the written submission filed after the

argument says P14(b) which is an unsigned and

unauthenticated and unendorsed and unsigned purported inquiry

report, [which] is absolutely unlawful and simply cannot be

accepted in terms of the statute, the Petitioner itself tendered the

signed copy of P14(b) with the motion dated 13.01.2017 when it

moved to support the application for interim relief. This signed

copy of P14(b) is a part of the Magistrates Court proceedings

initiated against the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent to recover

the money payable to the 6th Respondent. The Petitioner did not

challenge the veracity or genuineness of those signatures at that

time.

I need hardly emphasise the discretionary nature of the

prerogative writs which cannot be invoked as a matter of right.

He who invokes the writ jurisdiction of this Court shall come

with clean hands and act in utmost good faith.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I am unable to

accept the said fresh point advanced by the Petitioner at the

stage of the argument.

Let me now consider the standpoint taken up by the Petitioner

in the petition.

The Petitioner seeks to quash the decision in P14(b) by certiorari

on the merits. In my view, it is not possible to do so in the

unique facts and circumstances of this case. Admittedly, the

decision in P14(b) was made ex parte.

10

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd,4

the Supreme Court, citing several authorities,5 held:

A party seeking to canvass an order entered ex-parte

against him must apply in the first instance to the court

which made it. This is a rule of practice which has become

deeply ingrained in our legal system.

A party cannot, without having purged default in the original

Court by which the ex parte Order was made, come before the

Court of Appeal straightaway against such Order on the merits.6

However, in an exceptional situation, the Court of Appeal can

exercise revisionary jurisdiction to set aside an ex parte

Judgment or Order made by a lower Court, if it is palpably

wrong, perverse and results in a manifest failure of justice.7

As I held in Certis Lanka Security Solutions (Pvt) Ltd v.

Weerasinghe,8 this principle of law shall not be confined to

judicial proceedings but shall be extended to inquiries by any

tribunal exercising quasi-judicial or administrative powers that

affect the rights of citizens.

11

In the instant case, as I have already stated, upon receipt of the

impugned Order P14(b) with the letter P14(a), the Petitioner by

P15(a) rightly requested the 1st Respondent to vacate the ex

parte Order P14(b) and refix the matter for inquiry. This was

refused by the 1st Respondent by P17.

In my view, the Petitioner should have come before this Court

primarily seeking to quash P17 by certiorari. If P17 is quashed

and P15(a) is allowed, the 1st Respondent would have to vacate

P14(b) and hold the inquiry afresh. The Petitioner did not do so.

This Court cannot hold the default inquiry or main inquiry and

make an Order on the merits. It appears the Petitioner expects

this Court to do so.

The Petitioner says that although the 1st Respondent made the

impugned ex parte Order P14(b) on 26.10.2015, the Petitioner by

letter dated 26.10.2015 marked P13(a) informed the 1st

Respondent of its inability to attend the inquiry on 26.10.2015.

The Petitioner tenders the registered postal article receipt

marked P13(b) as proof. Although P13(a) is dated 26.10.2015,

the post office date stamp on P13(b) shows it was posted only on

28.10.2015.

The vehicle, which was handed over to the Petitioner as per the

consensus reached on 13.10.2015, remains in the custody of the

Petitioner.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

Petitioner with costs.
