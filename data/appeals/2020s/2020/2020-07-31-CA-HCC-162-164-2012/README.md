The accused-appellants filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgement

delivered by the Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 10.02.2012 in

Case No. HCE 15/2008.

The 1 s\ 2nd,and 3rd accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1 s\ 2nd and

3rd appellants) together with the 4th accused, were indicted before the High

Court of Ratnapura for having committed the murder of Sembakuttige

Samarapala on or about 14.07.1993, an offence punishable under section 296 of

the Penal Code.

The case has been transferred to the High Court ofEmbilipitiya on 27.02.2008.

At the trial, the prosecution called 6 witnesses including two eye witness - the

son and the daughter of the deceased (PW 02 and PW 03), the brother of the

deceased (PW 01), IP UpaJi Senerath Yapa (PW 04), Police Sergeant Gamage

Kulasiri (PW 05) and the JMO who conducted the post mortem examination

Page 3 of 20

(PW 06). The 1

51 and 3rd appellants had gIven evidence In Court while 2nd

appellant and the 41h accused had made dock statements.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellants for the offence of murder and thereby sentenced to death. The 41h

accused was acquitted by the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge of

Embilipitiya dated 10.02.2012.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellants made this appeal to this

Court.

Facts of the Case

This is a case of murder alleged to have committed by 4 accused, where the 151

and 2nd appellants are in-laws of the deceased and the 3rd appellant is the wife of

the deceased. It is elicited that the deceased was said to have been (living

together with another woman) in Welikanda where he used to visit his residence

(where his family lives) on and off.

Sembukuttige Dulip Nishantha (son of the 3rd appellant and the deceased) is the

principal witness (PW 02 - an eye-witness) in this case for the prosecution.

According to him, he had seen the 1

51 accused armed with a club and the

deceased was bleeding from his head. Thereafter the deceased was wrapped in a

mat and was carried to the stream by the 2nd and 3rd appellants while the 3rd

appellant was heading them with a torch. Then the 1

51 appellant was holding the

deceased from his legs while dipping his head under water. Thereafter the neck

of the deceased had been severed by the 1

51 and 2nd appellants and the 3rd

appellant had buried the decapitated head of the deceased in a nearby banana

mound in their compound. Then the 2nd appellant had washed out the blood

from the body of the deceased and then the 1

51 appellant had separated the arms

and legs from the body and had put them into a composte bag (@CS)@e5))O

Page 4 of 20

rul(5)c5~) where the 2nd appellant had taken it from the house and had tied it

while the 3rd appellant was holding the torch. Then they had taken the bag away.

The 4th witness IP Senerath Yapa testified that the body of the deceased was not

found but only the head was recovered about a month after the disappearance of

the said deceased. The head was buried under a banana tree, in the premises of

the 3rd appellant (where the deceased and the 3rd appellant were living).

Grounds of Appeal by the Appellants

The Learned Counsel for the 1

51 appellant submitted following grounds of

appeal:

I. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the doubts created

on the doctor's evidence as to the identification ofthe skull.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the doubts created

as to the age of the deceased.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the inconsistency

and the inter se and per se contradictions of PW 02 who claims to be an

eye witness.

4. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the contradictions

of evidence with regard to the alleged assault on the head of the

deceased.

5. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the contradictions

of evidence with regard to the alleged blow dealt by an axe to separate

the head from the body of the deceased.

Page S of 20

6. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the contradictions

of evidence with regard to dipping the head of the deceased in the

stream.

7. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the underlying

principles of the presumption of innocence.

The Learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants submitted following grounds

of appeal:

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the totality of the

evidence of the case.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the case of each

accused separately.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the prosecution

had failed to establish the fact that the 2nd and 3rd accused were acquitted

by a common murderous intention beyond reasonable doubt.

4. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider whether the

prosecution witnesses are creditworthy to uphold a conviction of murder.

5. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the matters raised

by the defense and which are favourable to the defence.

Page 6 of 20

6. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider whether the

circumstantial evidence which were lead substantiate an irresistible

inference of guilt of the 2nd and the 3'd accused for the offence of murder.

Legal Analysis.

1. I will consider the 1 st appellant's 1 st ,2nd ,4th ,5th and 6th grounds of

appeal together, as those grounds basically question the identity of

the head that was found. Further, these grounds raised a question as

to whether the said Sembakuttige Samarapala had been killed by the

appellants or not.

The Learned High Court Judge has clearly analyzed this fact in his judgment

with due diligence as follows;

Court Judgment)

Further, the Learned High Court Judge had referred to the judgment of C.A. No.

135/2003, where Justice Sisira de Abrew had referred to Sarwan Singh Vs

State of Punjab 2002 AIR S.c. (111) 3652 at 33655 and 3656 where Indian

Supreme Court held:

"It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail

himself of the opportunity to put his case in Cross examination it must follow

that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted'

Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge had referred to the judgment of

C.A. No. 135/2003, where Justice Sisira de Abrew had referred to Motilal Vs

State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125 MP,

where Indian Courts held:

"Absence of cross examination of prosecution witness of certain fact leads to

inference of admission of that fact"

Further, in the case of Mohomed Uvais alias Paraniam Suresh V. The

Republic (2014 BASL LR 514), it was held that,

Page 8 of 20

"In the light of the above judicial decisions, I hold that whenever

evidence given by a witness on a material point is not challenged in

cross-examination, it has to be concluded that such evidence is not

disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course to the

qualification that the witness is a reliable witness ... "

Thus, it was uncontradicted evidence that the head that was identified was in

fact the head of the deceased by his children (2nd witness and 3rd witness). This

identification had been done before the Magistrate during the investigation.

(Pg.270 of the Appeal Brief. Proceedings dated 02.11.2006 of Case No.

H.C.Ratnapura 72/96)

In addition, the wife of the deceased, who has been made an accused in the

instant case, also had identified the head as the head of her husband. This

identification had been done prior to making her as an accused in the same case.

Even though this fact lacks any evidential value, it is pertinent to shed light on

the fact that the 3rd appellant herself had identified the head as the head of the

deceased and this fact has never been challenged by the defence at any stage of

the trial. (Pg.270 of the Appeal Brief. Proceedings dated 02.11.2006 of Case

No. H.C.Ratnapura 72/96)

In view of the above, it is evident that both the daughter and the son of the

deceased identified and admitted that the head which was found belonged to the

deceased.

The 1 S\ 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th grounds of appeal on behalf of the 1 st appellant

thereby fails from the fact of non-identification of the deceased. Hence it is

evident that the head of the deceased belonged to Sembakuttige Samarapala.

JMO L.B.L. De Alwis (PW 06) in his evidence mentioned that the cause of the

death was due to a fracture of the head caused by a heavy blunt weapon.

Further, the deceased had sustained the injury at a sleeping position. The above

Page 9 of 20

evidence was corroborated by PW 02. Evidence given by PW 06 as regards to

the blow dealt by an axe to separate the head from the body of the deceased

(Pg.346, 347, 348 and 349 of the Appeal Brief), was also corroborated by PW

02.

The Learned High Court Judge has clearly analyzed in his judgement that the

deceased had been mostly living in welikanda (Pg. 11 and 12 of the High Court

Judgement). Therefore the fact whether the deceased was a habitual betel

chewer would have been an unknown fact to his family members who never got

an opportunity to live with him on a daily basis.

The Counsel for the 1 sl appellant has stated in his written submission that the

deceased should be absolutely more than 30 years of age. The JMO has stated

that the deceased is a person of around 35 years of age. The JMO further stated

that the deceased could be at least 25 years of age and his age ranges from 25 to

40 years of age. (Pg.345 and 346 ofthe Appeal Brief)

Therefore, the argument brought out by the Counsel for the I SI appellant that the

Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the doubts created as to the age

of the deceased is hereby failed.

Moreover, in Gratiaen Perera V. The Queen (61 NLR 522), it was held that,

" .... the Judge must not accept the expert's opinion without making an attempt

himself to decide whether the grounds on which the expert's opinion is formed

are satisfactory. The opinion of the expert is relevant but the decision must,

nevertheless, be the Judge 's."

In the case of The King V. Ebert Silva (50 NLR 457), where some bones of

the deceased persons were the only evidence available as to the "corpus delictI"

- body of the deceased personals, it has been held by Howard C.J. that,

"The caution that a man should never be convicted of murder or manslaughter

on circumstantial evidence alone unless the body of the deceased person has

been found need not, however, be followed when very strong circumstantial

evidence of death can be given. "

In this present case there is an eye-witness supported by the above mentioned

evidence. Therefore, there is cogent evidence to prove that the skull belongs to

the deceased.

Page 11 of 20

2. The 3rd ground of appeal raised on behalf of the lsi appellant as to the

inconsistency and the inter se and per se contradictions of PW 02

who claims to be an eye witness.

There were only 4 contradictions marked as V 1 to V 4 from the evidence of PW

02 and JMO. IP Senarath Yapa had corroborated the evidence given by the 2nd

witness, Sembukuttige Dulip Nishantha.

The Learned Trial Judge of the High Court of Embilipitiya gives a good

explanation as to these contradictions made by the said PW 02.

In the case of The AG V. Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2 Sri L.R. 144, it

was observed that,

"When faced with contradictions in a witness 's testimonial, the court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

Page 12 of 20

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness. The

court must also come to a determination regarding whether this

contradiction was an honest mistake on the part of the witness or

whether it was a deliberate attempt to mislead court ... "

Further, in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. M.K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC

481, it was held that,

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a

ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary

for the Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view

the deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as

a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general

tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier

evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief "

A similar opinion had been borne in the case of B. Bhoghinbhai Hirjibhai v

State of Gujarat (AIR) 1983 SC 753, where it was held that,

"Over much importance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies. The

reasons are obvious: - (I) By and large a witness cannot be expected to

possess a photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It

is not as if a videotape is replayed on the mental screen; (2) ordinarily it

so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness could not

have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of

surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned

to absorb the details; (3) the powers of observation differ from person to

person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement

Page 13 of 20

might emboss its image on one person's mind, whereas it might go

unnoticed on the part of another, (4)By and large people cannot

accurately recall a conversation and reproduce them very words used

by them or heard by them. They can only recall the main purport of the

conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape

recorder; (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration

of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work

on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot

expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.

Again, it depends on the 'time-sense' of individuals which varies from

person to person. (6) Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall

accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or

in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up,

when interrogated later on, (7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is

liable to be overawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing cross

examination made by counsel and out of nervousness mix up facts, get

confused regarding sequence of events, or fill up details from

imagination on the spur of moment. The subconscious mind of the witness

sometimes so operates on account of the fear of looking foolish, or being

disbelieved, though the witness is giving a truthful and honest account

of the occurrence witnessed by him-perhaps it is a sort of a

psychological defence mechanism activated on the spur of the moment ...

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the

basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue

importance. More so when the all-important "probabilities- factor"

echoes infavour of the version narrated by the witnesses. "

Further, the written submissions on behalf of the 151 appellant refers to the case

of Kalinga Padmatilaka alias Sergeant Elpitiya V. The Director General

Page 14 of 20

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. (SC

Appeal No: 99/2007) 2010 B.LR. 67, in order to prove the unreliable nature of

the evidence given by PW 2 while drawing attention to "inconsistent

statements" as highlighted in the said case.

In Kalinga PadmatiIaka alias Sergeant EIpitiya V. The Director General

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (Supra),

decided by Chandra Ekanayake,J., the evidence given on behalf of the

Prosecution had "contradicted the evidence given even with regard to the date

of the incident" and in such a situation it has undoubtedly been an instance

where the contradictions made by the prosecution goes to the root of the case.

Further, in the same case, it has been held that,

" ... one cannot be unmindful of the proposition that Court cannot mechanically

reject the evidence of any witness."

Thus, as it has been referred to Sir John Woodroffe & Amir Ali's "Law of

Evidence - 18th Edition - VoLl at pg. 471, in the same judgement, "No hard

and fast rule can be laid down about appreciation of evidence. It is after all a

question of fact and each case has to be decided on the facts as they stand in

that particular case."

Therefore, the above cited case laws and the Learned High Court Judge's clear

observations prove the fact that the position taken by the 1

5t appellant is not

applicable under the circumstances of this case.

Hence, I agree with the view borne by the Learned High Court Judge of

Embilipitiya.

Page 15 of 20

3. The 71h ground of appeal as raised on behalf of the lSI appellant was

that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

underlying principles of the presumption of innocence.

The Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya had considered the underlying

principles of the presumption of innocence at the very beginning of the

judgment dated 10.02.2012 at page 2 of the said judgment. As it is clearly

analyzed and decided, the conviction of the 1", 2nd and 3rd accused and the

acquittal of the 4th accused after satisfYing that the prosecution has proved its

case beyond reasonable doubt.

4. The 2nd , 3rd and 61h grounds of appeal raised on behalf of the 2nd and

3rd appellants questions the common intention that the 2nd and 3rd

appellants had shared with the 1 sl appellant.

According to the evidence given by PW 02, subsequent conduct of the 3rd

appellant and also considering the totality of evidence before Court is

sufficient to show that all three accused shared a common intention. This

fact has been further analyzed by the Learned High Court Judge of

Embilipitiya as follows;

Judgement)

The above mentioned acts clearly demarcate the participatory presence of all

three appellants.

As it is stated in the written submissions on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd

appellants, in King V. Ranasinghe 47 NLR 373, it was held that:

"Common intention 'within the meaning of section 32 of the Penal

Code is different from same or similar intention. The inference of

common intention should not be reached unless it is a necessary inference

deducible from the circumstances of the case. "

Thus, it is evident that the common intention is clearly inferred from the

circumstances in the present case as it has been illustrated clearly by the

Learned Trial Judge of the High Court ofEmbilipitiya.

Participatory presence at the commencement of an incident in furtherance of

a common intention is enough to establish vicarious liability as it has been

enunciated by Sarath De Abrew, 1. in Iddagodage Sarath Kumara V. The

Attorney General, (C.A. 205/2008).

Further, in their written submission, the 2nd and 3rd appellants has referred to

the case Queen V Vincent Fernando 65 NLR 265, where it has been held

that:

Page 17 of 20

" ... to be liable under section 32, a mental sharing of the common intention

is not sufficient; the sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act or illegal

omission manifesting the state of mind'.

In the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge had clearly analyzed the

conduct of each accused in committing the offence of murder with common

intention. The Learned High Court Judge has acquitted the 4th accused on

careful consideration on the "mental sharing of the common intention" as

well as the sharing of a "criminal act" which had taken place by each

accused.

5. The 1st , 4th and 5th grounds of appeal raised on behalf of the 2nd and

3rd appellants addresses the credibility of evidence, credibility of

witnesses and the due regard given to the defence case.

As it has been clearly analyzed by the Learned High Court Judge, (Pg.23 of his

High Court Judgement), I see no reason for a child to tell lies before a court to

make false allegations against his or her own mother who gave birth to him/her.

It is highly unlike that a child would falsely implicate his own mother for the

murder of his own father at the age of 10 years and reiterate the same position

after ten years upon the instigation of anyone, when he is capable of

distinguishing between good and bad. Therefore, all facts and context

considered, there appears to be no lack of credibility on the part of the witness.

In the case of Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka [2010] 2 Sri LR 241, it

has been held by Sisira de Abrew, J. that,

Page 18 of 20

"Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge, Court of Appeal

will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial Judge with regard to the credibility

of a witness unless such findings of trial Judge are manifestly wrong."

Further, in the case of Ambika Prasad and another V. State (Delhi

Administration) (2000) SCC Cri. L 522 the Indian Supreme Court observed

that,

'a criminal trial is meant for doing justice to the accused, victim and the

society so that law and order is maintained. A judge does not preside

over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A

judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One is as

important as the other. Both are public duties ... "

According to section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance,

"No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof

of any fact".

In the case of Vadivelu Thevar V. State of Madras [1957 AIR 614], it was

held that,

"On a consideration of the relevant authorities and the provisions of

the Indian Evidence Act, the following propositions may be safely stated

as firmly established:

(I) As a general rule, a court can and may act on the testimony of a

single witness though uncorroborated. One credible witness outweighs

the testimony of a number of other witnesses of indifferent character ...

Page 19 of 20

(3) Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or is not

necessary, must depend upon facts and circumstances of each case and

no general rule can be laid down in a matter like this and much depends

upon the judicial discretion of the Judge before whom the case comes. In

view of these considerations, we have no hesitation in holding that the

contention that in a murder case, the court should insist upon plurality of

witnesses, is much too broadly stated. Section 134 of the Indian Evidence

Act has categorically laid it down that "no particular number of

witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact." The

legislature determined, as long ago as 1872, presumably after due

consideration of the pros and cons, that it shall not be necessary for proof

or disproof of a fact, to call any particular number of witnesses ... "

Considering above, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has

come to the correct conclusion after careful consideration of all the evidence

placed at the trial. Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the conviction and

the sentence imposed on the appellants, by the Learned High Court Judge, I

affirm the same.

This appeal is hereby dismissed.
