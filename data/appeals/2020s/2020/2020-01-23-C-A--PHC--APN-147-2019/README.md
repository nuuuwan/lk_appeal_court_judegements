HON. JUSTICE K.K. WICKREMASINGHE

Counsel for the Accused-Petitioner makes submissions in support of his

application. He has not averred exceptional circumstances in the petition

and also not submitted any exceptional circumstances during his

submissions in order to see whether there is a prima facie case to issue

notice to the Respondent. The Accused-Petitioner had been convicted for

criminal breach of trust of Rs.539235/ - and sentenced for three months

rigorous imprisonment and ordered to pay a compensation of

Rs.539235/ -, if defaults three months simple imprisonment. Further, he

has not made an appeal seeking to set aside the abovementioned order

dated 01.10.2019. Since there is no prima facie case established, we

dismiss the application without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

HON. JUSTICE K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO

I agree.
