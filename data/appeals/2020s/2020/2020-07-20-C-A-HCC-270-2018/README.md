ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 3rd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

preferred the instant appeal seeking to set aside his conviction for murder

entered by the High Court of Colombo in case No. HCj3370j2005 and the

imposition of sentence of death.

In the indictment filed by the Hon. Attorney General before the High

Court, the Appellant, along with two others were accused of having committed

murder of Egambarampillai Rasaiah Sekar on 15.05.1997 at Orugodawatta.

At the initial stages, the Appellant appeared before the High Court but

before his trial commenced he absconded and tried in absentia. The High Court

convicted the 1st accused and Appellant to murder while acquitting the 2nd

2

'~-------------------------------------------------------------------------,

accused. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred the instant appeal through his Attorney-at-Law.

On 02.04.2019, the Appellant was represented before this Court by his

Counsel with a letter of authority said to be issued by him and filed written

submissions in support of the appeal. Since then there was no appearance for the

Appellant. Therefore, this Court proceeds to consider the merits of the

Appellant's appeal as per Section 325(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979.

It was contended by the Appellant that the charge of murder against the

Appellant is not proved beyond reasonable doubt since PW2 is not reliable, who

should be considered as an accomplice, and the said witness's evidence is

contradictory with that of PW9.

The prosecution, although had led evidence of several lay witnesses,

Palliyage Prasanna Perera only clearly incriminated the Appellant with the murder

of the deceased. According to this witness, he along with the deceased and one

Selvam were at a roadside boutique along Majeed Place of Orugodawatta. He also

saw the 1st accused and the Appellant there. These two initially spoke with the

deceased and then, realising something is about to happen, the witness had

crossed on to the other side of the road. He saw the 1 st accused throwing a punch

at the deceased. With the punch the deceased fell down. Then the witness saw

the Appellant dropping a big stone on the fallen deceased, who screamed. The

witness fled from the scene as they were chased away by the 1st accused.

The medical evidence revealed that the deceased had two contused

abrasions on his head which caused subdural haematoma of 25 ml of blood in

the left occipital and parietal area with contusion of left occipital pole. The death

l r-____________________________________________________________________ --,

of the deceased was due to Cranio-cerebral injuries. Consultant JMO Dr.

Subramanium was of the opinion that the head injuries could be a result of

dropping a stone on the head and the internal injuries caused by such blunt

trauma is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

It is against the back drop of above evidence that this Court would venture

to consider the grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant.

One of the grounds was that the evidence of the witness Prasanna Perera

was not analysed properly by the High Court for its credibility. In this context, it

must be noted that the Appellant did not cross-examine the witness since he

opted to abscond. Therefore, the Appellant relies on the cross-examination

conducted on behalf of the 2nd accused to sustain his contention. The 2nd accused

has suggested to the witness that he was not involved with this incident. The

witness admitted that position. Other than eliciting the 2nd accused's non-

participation, there was no cross-examination of the witness to assail his

credibility. In short, the High Court had no basis to reject his evidence.

The two injuries found on the head of the deceased does not create a dent

in the witnesses' evidence since the witness was emphatic that as he saw the

Appellant dropping the stone on the deceased, he was chased by the 1st accused.

He did not see where the deceased was hit with the stone or whether it was once

or several times the stone was dropped. The investigating officer did not recover

the stone from the scene and the exact nature of the object was therefore not

known.

In this context, the contention that the witnesses account and the medical

evidence does not correspond with each other cannot succeed.

.' , lr-________________________________________________________________________ ~

There was clear expert opinion that the head injuries caused to the

deceased are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, whoever

who dropped that stone had dropped it on the head of the deceased " with the

intention of causing bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary

course of nature to cause death" as per limb three of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

There was clear and unambiguous evidence before the High Court that it was the

Appellant who dropped that stone on the deceased, who had fallen on the

ground,

Hence the conviction for murder is clearly sustainable.

In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs, this Court

is of the opinion that there is no merit in the appeal of the Appellant.

His conviction for murder and the sentence of death imposed by the High

Court of Colombo is therefore affirmed.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly dismissed.
