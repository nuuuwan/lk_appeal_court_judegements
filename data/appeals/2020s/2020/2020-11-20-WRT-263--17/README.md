The permit under the Land Development Ordinance was issued

to Richard Jayasundera in respect of the land described in the

grant X3A. It is clear from the Land Ledger Y1 that Richard

Jayasundera named his son Chandradasa Jayasundera, who

was 12 years of age at that time, as his nominated successor.

Chandradasa Jayasundera was the father of the Petitioner.

Richard Jayasundera died in 1960.

As seen from the Land Ledger, Asilin Rodrigo was named the

owner/permit-holder of the land on 11.08.1962, nearly two

years after the death of Richard Jayasundera. Asilin Rodrigo

was the widow of Richard Jayasundera and the mother of

Chandradasa Jayasundera.

At the time Asilin Rodrigo was named the owner/permit-holder

in 1962, according to section 2 of the Land Development

Ordinance, owner meant the owner of a holding whose title

thereto is derived from or under a grant issued under the

Ordinance, and permit-holder meant any person to whom a

permit has been issued.

It is important to realise that the naming of Asilin Rodrigo as the

owner/permit-holder in 1962 is not the same as succession to

the land by the widow of the owner/permit-holder by operation

of the law. Section 48A(1), which recognises the right of the

spouse to succeed to the land whether or not nomination has

been made, was first introduced in the year 1969 by the Land

Development (Amendment) Act, No.16 of 1969.

At the time Asilin Rodrigo was named owner/permit-holder, the

permit was considered personal to the permit-holder. The old

section 26, which was repealed by Act No.16 of 1969, read as

follows:

A permit shall for all purposes be and be construed as

personal to the permit-holder and upon his death no title

whatsoever to the land held under such permit shall pass or

accrue to his heirs or to any person other than a successor

4

duly nominated by such permit-holder in the manner

hereinafter provided.

At that time, a permit-holder could nominate his spouse as his

successor but there was no automatic succession. The old

Section 77, which was repealed by the same Act of 1969, read as

follows:

A permit-holder may nominate as his successor his spouse or

any relative of his out of the group of relatives mentioned in

rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

Chandradasa Jayasundera died in 1975.

Asilin Rodrigo was issued the grant X3A in 1983. This, in my

view, was in sequence to her being made the owner/permit-

holder of the land in 1962.

I must stress that except for the Land Ledger Y1, no permit

issued to either Richard Jayasundera or Asilin Rodrigo has been

tendered to Court. The Land Ledger has been tendered by the

Petitioner. She relies on it. Hence the Court can go by its

contents.

The grant X3A was issued in terms of section 19(4) read with

section 19(6) of the Land Development Ordinance.

Asilin Rodrigo died in 1992 without nominating a successor in

the grant.

The question to be decided is who was entitled to succeed to the

land after the death of Asilin Rodrigo?

5

The 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary decided by Z that the

4th Respondent being the eldest surviving son of Asilin Rodrigo

shall succeed to the land.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash the said

decision by a writ of certiorari and compel the 1st Respondent by

a writ of mandamus to nominate the Petitioner to succeed to the

land on the basis that he is the only surviving child of

Chandradasa Jayasundera.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, as I have already

stated, the grant in favour of Asilin Rodrigo was not issued

under section 48A(1) of the Land Development Ordinance.

In my view, the nomination of Chandradasa Jayasundera as the

successor of Richard Jayasundera came to an end upon Asilin

Rodrigo becoming the owner/permit-holder of the land. Up to

now, nobody has challenged Asilin Rodrigo being made the

owner/permit-holder of the land in the year 1962.

If no successor has been nominated or the nominated successor

fails to succeed in terms of section 68(2), the title to the land

shall devolve as prescribed by Rule 1 of the Third Schedule read

with section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance.

Let us assume the nomination of Chandradasa Jayasundera

was enforceable. Even then, rights to the land do not accrue

merely by nomination unless the nominated successor also

succeeds to the land in terms of section 68(2).

In terms of section 73, the nominated successor can succeed to the

land only after the death of the permit-holder or, if the permit-

6

holder is survived by his or her spouse, upon the failure of such

spouse to succeed to the land or after the death of such spouse.

Obviously Chandradasa Jayasundera could not have succeeded

to the land because he predeceased the spouse of the permit-

holder, Asilin Rodrigo (i.e. the mother of Chandradasa

Jayasundara).

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner draws the attention

of the Court to Land Order No.154 found in the State Land Manual.

The Divisional Secretary also refers to this in the impugned Order.

There is no necessity for me to consider whether the said Land

Orders have the force of law, as the said Order is inapplicable in

this case. Let me explain.

According to learned Presidents Counsel, Order No.154 refers to

two situations. The first is where there are more nominees than one

and one nominee dies after the death of the permit holder. The

second situation is where the nominee dies before the death of the

permit-holder. The case at hand does not relate to either of these

situations. There are not several nominees. Nor did the nominee

die before the permit-holder.

As Asilin Rodrigo has not nominated a successor in the grant, the

title to the holding shall devolve as prescribed by Rule 1 of the

Third Schedule read with section 72 of the Land Development

Ordinance.

Accordingly, the decision of the 1st Respondent that the 4th

Respondent shall succeed to the land is flawless.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
