Judgment on: 20112/2019

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Officer in Charge of the Vavuniya Police filed an information dated

06/0112012, in the Magistrates Court of Vavuniya in terms of Section 66(1)(a) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) upon a

complaint by the Party of the 1st part-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to

as the Appellant) on 26/1112011, that unknown persons have dumped building

material in the disputed land on 2511 112011. The Appellant had purchased the said

land in 1979 and is presently in possession. The party of the 2nd Part-Respondent-

Respondent, (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) in the statement to the

police dated 2811 11201 J, stated that due to civil disturbances in the area she moved

to laffna and therefore had leased the disputed land to'one Indraraj. Having

considered the respective affidavits and the documents filed by the parties, the

learned Magistrate by order dated 17/01/2013, held that the Respondent was

forcibly removed from possession of the disputed land within a period of two

months immediately prior to the date of filing of the information and has placed

the Respondent in possession. The revision application filed before the High Court

of the Northern Province holden in Vavuniya was turned down without notice

being issued to the Respondent for want of exceptional circumstances. The

Appellant is before this Court to canvas the said order on the basis that the learned

Magistrate has erred by holding that the Respondent had been forcibly ejected

from the land within the period of two months immediately preceding the date on

which the first information was filed.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent has raised the following issues.

Absence of exceptional circumstances to proceed with this application

The affidavit filed in the High Court is defective

I will first deal with the merits of the case and thereafter, address the issues

raised by the Appellant.

As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, in the given facts

and circumstances the questions to be addressed by the learned Magistrate in terms

of Section 66 of the Act are twofold.

Page 3 of 8

1. Which party was in possession of the land in question, when the

infonnation to Court was filed under Section 66(1)(a) and,

2. As to whether any party has been forcibly dispossessed within the period of

two months immediately preceding the date of the filing of the first

infonnation in Court.

The Respondent takes up the position that, there was no dispossession from

the land and has prayed that the Respondent was in actual possession on the date

of filing the first infonnation and therefore was entitled to a detennination in tenns

of Section 68(1) of the Act. The Respondent in the affidavit filed of record

submits that after the Army released the land, she has been maintaining the

disputed land since the latter part of 2009. The Respondent relies on a survey plan

of the disputed land dated 0211112011, marked "2V3", and a copy of a receipt of

payment of Assessment Tax dated 30105/2011 , marked "2V4". The Appellant

admits that the said survey was carried out at the time he was in possession of the

land.

The Appellant claims that, he has put up a house using tin sheets in which

he resides and engage in cultivating the land. The Appellant also tenders a survey

plan of the disputed land which he claims to have surveyed on 19/10/2011. In the

statement made to the police the Appellant states that on 25111120 II , unidentified '

persons disturbed possession of the land by placing stones and sand claiming to

build a house. In this context, it is to be noted that the statement given by the

Page 4 of 8

Respondent to the police on 2811112011, contradicts the position taken by the

Respondent in the counter affidavit tendered to Court. The Respondent in her

statement to the police did not say that she was in possession of the said land. The

Respondent claimed that the land was leased to one Indraraj and the said indraraj

placed building materials on the land. To the contrary in the counter affidavit at

paragraph 18, it is claimed that the building materials had been brought to the land

by the Respondent. The statement to the police by the Respondent reveals that she

did not possess the land and that the dispute arose as a result of Indraraj, who is

alleged to have obtained the land on a lease, unloading construction material.

There is also no evidence before Court that the Respondent was dispossessed from

the land two months prior to the date of filing the information.

When this application was taken up for argument, the submission for the

Respondent centered around the fact that a survey by the Respondent of the

disputed land could not have taken place, if the Appellant, as claimed, was in

possession of the land. It was also submitted that building material could not have

been unloaded by unknown persons specially in the vicinity of a high security

zone, where the land was located. Such facts in my view cannot be considered as

convincing facts to determine that the Appellant was not in possession or

dominion over the disputed land.

Therefore, in the given circumstances, I find no material to justify the

findings of the learned Magistrate that the Respondent was dispossessed from the

land in dispute two months prior to the filing of information.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent submits that the Appellate Court

will interfere with an order of a lower court only in exceptional circumstances and

states that in the application made before the High Court of Vavuniya, the

Appellant has failed to place any exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of

Court and in support has cited the case of Urban Development Authority Vs.

Ceylon Entertainments Ltd. (2002) BASL Law Journal at page 65, where it was

held that, "the existence of exceptional circumstances should be expressly pleaded

when an application to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction is made"

However, in Welikakala Withanage Shantha Sri Jayalal and Another Vs.

Kusumawathie Pigera and Others (CA (PHC) APN 69/2009, C.A.M. 23.07.2013,

where Salam J. held (at page 5-6);

"It does not mean, that the Petitioner who invokes the revisionary powers of the

court should in his petition state in so many words that "exceptional grounds

exist " to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction in addition to pleading the grounds on

which the revision is sought...

It is actually for the court find out whether the circumstances enumerated in the

petition constitute exceptional circumstances. "

In the circumstances, I find that in the instant application there is enough

material disclosed by the statements, affidavits and the documents filed of record

which could be considered as exceptional circumstances to address an injustice

caused to the aggrieved party.

Another issue taken up by the Respondent is that the jurat in the affidavit

filed by the Appellant in the High Court does not confirm to the requirements of

the Oaths and Affirmations Act No. 13 of 1954, (as amended) on the basis that the

certification of the jurat is made by the Appellant instead of the commissioner for

oaths.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has cited the case of Kayas Vs.

Nazeer and Others (2004) 3 SLR 202, where, Weerasuriya J. held that;

"The object of Revision is the due administration of justice and correction of

errors and that power can be exercised in respect of any order of a lower court to

prevent an injustice on an application by an aggrieved person who is not even a

party to the case. "

In Facy Vs. Sanoon and 5 Others (2006) BLR 58, Marsoof J. held that;

"There is no doubt that the jurat clause is the most crucial part of an affidavit,

and if the jurat expressly sets out the place and date on which the affidavit was

signed, and that the affidavit was sworn or affirmed and signed before a Justice of

the Peace, that affidavit is in fact valid. "

In the circumstances, I do not see any reason why the Court should consider

the affidavit filed by the Appellant as invalid in law.

For all the above reasons, I set aside the impugned orders and allow the

application.

Appeal allowed.
