This application, which had been filed on 25th January 2017, had been

supported for notice and interim relief on 6th February 2017. On that date, this

Court, having heard the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners had

issued formal notice of this application on all Respondents. This Court had also

issued the following interim orders:

(1) An interim order restraining the Respondents from taking any steps

whatsoever to suspend, revoke or otherwise discontinue or reduce the

efficacy of the courses that have been offered thus far by the 2nd

Respondent to present and prospective students.

(2) An interim order directing the Respondents to maintain the status quo in

respect of all study programs and other activities conducted by the 2nd

Respondent until the final determination of this case.

When this matter was mentioned on lih February 2017, this Court had made

an order requesting the Hon. Attorney General to assist this Court in the

determination of this matter as Amicus Curiae.

This matter was taken up for argument on 9th May 2019, on which date all

learned Counsel moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions that have already been filed. This Court thereaher requested all

parties to tender clarifications on four issues raised by this Court, which has

been complied with.

5

The 1st Respondent is the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka, which has been

incorporated by the Institution of Engineers Act No. 17 of 1968, as amended,

with the objective, inter alia, of promoting the study of engineering and to

encourage original research with a view to facilitate the scientific and

economic development and the conservation of the resources of Sri Lanka.1

The 2nd Respondent is the IESL College of Engineering (private) Limited, a

company which was registered in 2011 under the provisions of the Companies

Act No. 7 of 2007. The sole shareholder of the 2nd Respondent is the 1st

Respondent.

While the 1st - 4th Petitioners are prospective students who had applied for the

2017 intake of the Graduate Diploma in Engineering programme conducted by

the 2nd Respondent, the rest of the Petitioners are students who have

registered for the said programme in the following years:

Petitioner Year of registration Status Year of graduation

5th _11th 2016 Full time 2020 1ih _ 14th 2015 Full time 2019

32 nd _ 42nd 2013 Part time 2018

43'd _ 46th 2012 Part time 2017

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

1 Vide Section 3(c).

6

It is not in dispute that since its incorporation, the 1st Respondent has been

conducting examinations to promote the study of engineering. The structure of

the examinations had been amended in 2002, and successful candidates had

been allowed to enter the field of engineering, as well as were entitled for

Associate Membership of the 1st Respondent. In 2008, a decision had been

taken to establish a College for the purpose of continuing with the educational

programmes that was conducted by the 1st Respondent. The shortcomings that

the 1st Respondent sought to overcome by the establishment of a College of

Engineering has been explained in detail in the Policy paper prepared in 2008.2

The 1st and 2nd Respondents have entered into a Memorandum of

Understanding dated 5th December 2012 (MOUl, annexed to the petition

marked 'P18', in terms of which the 1st Respondent has transferred the

responsibility of conducting engineering courses hitherto conducted by the 1st

Respondent, to the 2nd Respondent. Accordingly, in terms of 'P18' the 2nd

Respondent was required to continue to conduct the engineering courses

which had hitherto been conducted by the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioners state that in keeping with the MOU 'P18', the 2nd Respondent

has been conducting professional courses in the field of engineering since

2012. The programme that is the bone of contention in this application is the

Graduate Diploma in Engineering, which is a four year course offered since

2012 to students including school leavers with three passes at the Advanced

Level Examination.3 It is admitted between the parties that upon successful

completion of the said diploma programme, diplomates are entiUed for

2 Vide document annexed to the petition marked 'P16b'.

3 The newspaper advertisements calling for applications in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 have been annexed to the petition marked 'P8a' - 'P8d', respectively.

7

Associate Membership of the 1st Respondent and entry to the Engineering

profession.

The Petitioners have annexed to the petition marked 'P11', an extract from the

history page of the web site of the 1st Respondent, which sets out the following

rationale for the conducting of the said programme of study:

"The IESL, being the premier engineering body in Sri Lanka is called upon

to represent the profession at many national forums and contribute to

national development. In order to cater to the demand for professionally

qualified engineers in the Country, and to open an alternative route for

those aspiring to become qualified engineers but were unable to gain

admission to a University Engineering Faculty, IESL established the College

of Engineering as a subsidiary entity, which conducts an engineering

study program for school leavers and those employed in engineering or

technical organisations with suitable entry qualifications to become

qualified engineers."

In paragraph 42 of its Statement of Objections, which is reproduced below, the

1st Respondent has elaborated on the necessity to conduct the said Graduate

Diploma Programme, as follows:

"(a) Basic academic qualification required for corporate membership of the

IESL (Chartered Engineer) is a four year fUll-time Oegree in Engineering

obtained from a reputed and recognized university after qualifying at the

GCE (AIL) in the Physical Sciences stream.

8

(b) To facilitate practitioners involved in Engineering at various other levels

(Technicians, Technologists, etc), without the above basic qualification, to

upgrade themselves to the level of an Engineer recagnized by IESL, the

IESL has a technical instruction and evaluation mechanism called IESL

examinations (namely IESL, Part I, Part /I & Part /II) canducted by the IESL

Secretariat. With a view to upgrade this pracess, the IESL College of

Engineering was established in 2012 as a limited liability company wholly

owned by the IESL, intending to award 'Graduate Diplomas' (which is not

a degree) as an equivalent academic qualification recognized for

corporate membership.

(c) With the advent of the IESL College of Engineering, the composition of the

student clientele shifted fram a majority of originally intended

'practitioners in engineering fields seeking upgrading' to 'school leavers

without experience seeking alternate qualifications to embark on a

career' .

At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in 2008, the

Government of Sri Lanka contributed a sum of Rs. 10 million towards the

construction of a new building for the 1st Respondent. Paragraph 2.1.1 of the

Cabinet Memorandum seeking approval for the said contribution, annexed to

the petition marked 'P14', explains in the following manner the rationale for

the Government of Sri Lanka making the said contribution, as well as granting

tax concessions to those donors who wished to contribute towards the

construction of the said building:

9

"The education arm of the IESL is conducting a degree equivalent

engineering course which provides a much needed alternative career

path to students who drop out at the GCE Advance Level exam by

providing them with an avenue for further education and for job

opportunities in Sri Lanka and abroad, the entry requirements of which are

the same as those required by the engineering faculties of local

universities. The Course is much sought after by those students who have

successfully completed the Advance Level examination in the

mathematics stream but do not get admission to the Universities because

of the limited number of places available. This Course is becoming

increasingly popular among the school leavers and others already

employed as middle grade technicians. Because of the limited facilities

available in the existing building, IESL finds it difficult to cope with the

growing demand for more enrollment. To cater to this requirement, IESL

has planned to expand its building complex at Colombo 7."

Thus, it is not in doubt that the 1st Respondent commenced the said Diploma

Programme focusing on two groups of students but that the demand for the

said programme was from school leavers who had successfully completed the

Advanced Level examination. It is also clear that the 1st Respondent took

advantage of this fact, as 'P14' has identified it as a 'much needed alternative

career path' to schoolleavers with Advanced Level qualifications, and obtained

financial support and tax benefits from the Government, for the construction

of its new building.

The incident that has given rise to this application is a resolution dated 2nd

September 2016 proposed by 118 Corporate Members, 128 Associate

10

Members and 3 Student Members of the 1st Respondent, titled 'Resolution to

discontinue IESL College of Engineering'. The impugned resolution, annexed to

the petition marked 'P24', reads as follows:

"As all of us are aware that the College of IESL was started several years

back. It is conducting engineering courses in several disciplines. Its

certificate is treated by the IESL as equivalent to the engineering degrees

awarded by the three engineering faculties and the Universities of

Peradeniya, Moratuwa and Ruhuna.

We have following four concerns with regard to establishing the College of

IESL.

1. Was there any request from our general membership to conduct this

type of engineering course or a College by IESL?

2. Was there any requirement in the country to conduct this type of

engineering course by IESL?

3. Is it ethical to conduct such a college directly by the regulatory body

itself?

4. Where did the funds for construction of college come from?

In our point of view, the answer for the 1st three questions is 'No' and for

the last question the IESL is answerable to its members.

Further, regarding the College of IESL, our views are as follows:

11

1. Conducting of such a college, definitely creates a Conflict of Interest,

as IESL is the sole body (to) regulate (the) Engineering Profession in

Sri Lanka. Also IESL is empowered to provide Accreditation and

Recognition of Engineering degrees in Sri Lanka under Washington

Accord full membership status.

2. If the country needs more Engineers, IESL shall discuss that matter

with the Government and Universities to increase the intakes of State

Universities by enhancing resources and facilities.

3. Conducting Engineering Course (Part I & Part II) for Engineering

Diploma holders (NOT, NOES, HNDE) has been accepted worldwide as

an alternative route for acquiring the engineering qualifications.

Those who seek qualification from this alternative route may have

missed the Engineering facility entrance due to high competition

prevailing in the GCE (AIL) exam and selected to enter such courses

on merit basis. Further, they have an engineering background and

most of them starts follOWing IESL Part I and Part II after having

certain field experience.

4. The general public has made open remarks on IESL saying that the

College of IESL is another "Fake Degree Shop" and the aim of IESL is

to make profits. Hence reputation of all members of IESL is indirectly

being affected.

5. There are plenty of opportunities available in the country to obtain

Engineering Degrees utilizing private funding where regulation is

utmost important to protect general public from fake engineers.

12

Considering above facts, we propose that:

1. The College of IESL should be discontinued.

2. Rights of the present students of the College is to be reserved and

future enrolments should be separotely assessed by IESL following

the degree recognition process before providing any membership

class to them."

When this Court considers the averments contained in the Statement of

Objections filed by the 1st Respondent, as well as extracts of its 'history' taken

from its web site, both of which have been referred to earlier in this judgment,

it is clear to this Court that those who subscribed to 'P24' were completely

unaware of, or chose to ignore the circumstances under which the 2

nd

Respondent was established and the manner in which the various study

programmes including the Graduate Diploma programme were offered by the

1st Respondent, and the rationale for doing so.

Pursuant to the receipt of the said resolution, the 1st Respondent had

published the following notice dated 6th December 2016, annexed to the

petition marked 'P26a':

'The Council at its meeting held on 2nd December 2016 endorsed that new

intakes to the IESL College of Engineering with only GCE Advanced Level

quolifications, have been suspended by the Board of Directors of IESL

College of Engineering as per a board decision taken on 1st December

2016. "

13

Aggrieved by the above two documents 'P24' and 'P26a', the Petitioners filed

this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a} A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in 'P26a';

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the resolution marked 'P24' and/or any

other decision taken by the 1st Respondent to discontinue the 2nd

Respondent.

c) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from discontinuing or

reducing the efficacy of any of the courses offered by the 2nd Respondent

as well as discontinuing the 2nd Respondent.

In its Statement of Objections, the 1st Respondent has taken up the following

.. 4 positions:

a} There is no intention whatsoever on the part of the Respondents to

discontinue the 2nd Respondent;

b) The only intention is for the 1st Respondent to disassociate itself from the

2nd Respondent due to the obligations that the 1st Respondent had

undertaken in terms of the Washington Accord;

c) The 1st Respondent has only endorsed the decision taken by the 2nd

Respondent to suspend any further admission of students with Advanced

Level qualifications;

'The identical position has been taken up by the 2" Respondent.

14

d) The rights of the present students are not affected in manner by the said

decision.

e) The 2

nd Respondent shall continue to admit lateral entry students - i.e.

practitioners involved in Engineering or various other levels such as

Technicians, Technologists etc.

The 2

nd Respondent has reiterated the above position, and stated that the

decision to suspend new intakes of students with Advanced Level qualifications

was a decision taken by the 2

nd Respondent, and that the 1st Respondent only

endorsed such decision. No explanation however has been offered by the 2nd

Respondents as to why it decided to exclude school leavers with Advanced

Level qualifications. The 2

nd Respondent has also stated that the existing

students of the 2nd Respondent and their legitimate expectations shall not be

affected in any manner.

The complaint of the Petitioners to this Court is two-fold. Firstly, as students of

the 2nd Respondent College of Engi~eering , the Petitioners claim that they have

a legitimate expectation that the 2nd Respondent shall continue to function,

and award them the Graduate Diploma in Engineering, as held out at the time

of enrolment. This Court fully understands the concerns and apprehensions

that the 5th -46th Petitioners have expressed through this application, with

regard to the continuity of their course of study, and would go to the extent of

stating that the said Petitioners have a legitimate expectation that the 1

st

Respondent, being a responsible and respected professionai body, would

ensure the continuity of the said Diploma Programme through the 2

nd

15

Respondent, as represented to the said Petitioners at the time of entry, until

the said Petitioners graduate.

Although the resolution 'P24' has moved that the 2nd Respondent shall be

discontinued, the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have stated in their Statements

of Objections that the said resolution was never debated or approved by the

1st Respondent and have stated in unequivocal terms that the 2nd Respondent

shall not be closed down. This Court must observe further that the resolution

'P24' too recognises that the rights of the present students shall be 'reserved'.

This, together with the assurance given to this Court by the 1st and 2nd

Respondents that the rights of the present students shall not be affected, is

sufficient assurance for this Court that the 5th -46th Petitioners shall be

permitted to continue with their studies and graduate, upon the successful and

timely completion of the relevant examinations. This Court cannot insist upon

the 1st Respondent continuing with the 2nd Respondent in perpetuity and can

only address the concerns of those who are before this Court. For the reasons

set out above, this Court is of the view that the concerns of the Petitioners

have been addressed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. In view of this assurance

by the 1st a nd 2nd Respondents, the necessity for this Court to issue a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision to discontinue the 2nd Respondent, and a Writ

of Prohibition preventing the 2nd Respondent from being discontinued, does

not arise.

The second complaint of the Petitioners is that the decision to deny entry to

school leavers with three passes at the Advanced Level examination is unfair.

Those who are affected by this decision in 'P26a' are the 1st to the 4 th

Petitioners. It is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the decision

16

not to allow any further intake of students who only have three passes at the

Advanced Level examination was taken by the 2nd Respondent and that the 1st

Respondent only endorsed such decision. As observed earlier, no rational

explanation has been offered for this decision.

Be that as it may, the 2

nd Respondent is a limited liability company and

although the 1

st Respondent is its sole shareholder, the 2nd Respondent is not

carrying out any statutory function nor do its decisions have any statutory

flavor. Thus, decisions of the 2

nd Respondent, taken by its Board of Directors,

shall not be subject to judicial review. The necessity for the decision of the 2nd

Respondent to be endorsed by the 1st Respondent did not arise, and the

decision of the 2nd Respondent can stand alone. In these circumstances, this

Court is of the view that it does not have the jurisdiction to consider the prayer

for a Writ of Certiorari with regard to a decision of the 2

nd Respondent or to

consider a Writ of Prohibition in respect of the 2

nd Respondent.

In any event, this Court does not have the competence to decide on the entry

qualifications for programmes conducted by the 2

nd Respondent, nor does it

have the competence to decide on the programmes that the 2nd Respondent

should be conducting. This Court observes that the decision to exclude those

with Advanced Level qualifications only affects the 1st -4 th Petitioners, who

had sought admission for the 2017 programme. However, in view of the

interim relief issued by this Court, this Court assumes that those who

registered for the 2017 intake continued with their programme of study

unhindered, and would be eligible to graduate upon successful completion of

the programme of study and the examinations.

17

There are two other matters that this Court wishes to advert to. The first is

that the 1st Respondent has stated that its decision to disassociate itself from

the 2

nd Respondent was taken in view of a possible conflict of interest arising

from its commitment to the Washington Accord, which, according to the 1st

Respondent, is an international agreement between bodies responsible for

accrediting engineering degree programmes, consisting of 25 signatory

countries. The 1st Respondent has submitted that it became a full signatory to

the said Accord on 13th June 2014, and that as per the said Accord, the

signatory and its accreditation/recognition should be independent of

educational service providers delivering accredited/recognized programmes

within the Jurisdiction. The 1st Respondent states that for that reason, it can no

longer, through the 2nd Respondent, conduct engineering programmes, and/or

recognize and accredit such programmes, as there can be a conflict of interest.

The learned Counsel for the 22nd, 23'd and 25th Respondents, who are Council

members of the 1st Respondent, and who have objected to direct school

leavers being excluded from the Graduate Degree programme, has

contradicted the position of the 1st Respondent. The Hon. Attorney General

too has pointed out that the Respondents argument that it is compelled to

disassociate due ta the provisions of the Washington Accord is fraught with

conjecture and is not altogether the correct position. Although the 1st

Respondent has raised this issue, the assurance given to this Court that the 2

nd

Respondent will not be closed down, confirms that even if there is a conflict,

such conflict will be managed.

The second matter that this Court wishes to advert to is the endorsement by

the 1st Respondent of the decision of the 2nd Respondent to exclude school

18

leavers with three passes at the Advanced Level examinations from the said

programme. It is clear from the Cabinet Memorandum marked 'P14' that the

decision of the Government of Sri Lanka to contribute a sum of Rs. 10 million

towards the construction of a new building to be used for educational

purposes, was influenced by the fact that the 1st Respondent was admitting

students with Advanced Level qualifications who had not been successful in

getting into State Universities, thus easing the burden on the State. This fact

has been reiterated in the 1st Respondent's own web site. Thus, for the 1st

Respondent to endorse the decision of the 2nd Respondent, as evidenced by

'P26a' does not appear to be proper. Furthermore, this Court does not see any

nexus between the decision in 'P26a' to shut out school leavers with three

passes at the Advanced Level examination, and the conflict of interest issue

raised by the 1st Respondent, as the 2nd Respondent will continue to function,

and offer the said programme to other students. This Court is of the view that

the 1st Respondent must act in a responsible manner. Therefore it is the

expectation of this Court that the 1st Respondent would re-consider its

decision, and arrive at a decision which is not only reasonable but would be in

the best interests of the Country.

This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
