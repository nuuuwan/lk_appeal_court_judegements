Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

By this application the Petitioner, who had been serving as a

Flight Sergeant of the Sri Lanka Air Force, seeks a mandate in

the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent, the Commander of the Air Force, to discharge the

Petitioner under the clause Service No Longer Required

referred to in P2 and P6. The Petitioner submits the said

decision is inter alia illegal, ultra vires, perverse, against the

principles of natural justice, and in violation of the doctrine of

double jeopardy and the principle of proportionality.

3

The position taken by the Respondents in their statement of

objections is the said decision was made considering the

entirety of the past record of offences of the Petitioner and

specifically the final letter of warning issued to the Petitioner.

The Respondents have, in the statement of objections, listed out

four offences committed by the Petitioner and the punishments

meted out to the Petitioner thereon.

The first offence is the Petitioner having lost his service identity

card due to negligence, thereby committing an offence under

section 115(1)(b) of the Air Force Act, No. 41 of 1949, as

amended. For this offence, as seen from 1R3, he had been

admonished with an admin recovery of Rs.5000 from his

salary.

The second offence, according to paragraph 11(ii) of the

statement of objections, is as follows:

Upon conclusion of a Court of Inquiry into a claymore mine

attack at Kappalturai on 15 April 2006 it was found that

the petitioner neglected his primary duty as the male nurse

at the Kappalturai detachment to provide first aid to 28838

LAC Jayasekara, who was critically injured due to the

incident.

As the punishment for the above offence, the Petitioner was

served with a letter of warning marked 1R5, which cautioned

that commission of another offence could inter alia result in

discharge from the Air Force.

4

The third and fourth offences are connected. The third offence,

Conduct Prejudicial to Air Force Discipline, as stated in

paragraph 6 of the statement of objections, is:

[the Petitioner] at SLAF Station Katukurunda being the

Senior Non Commissioned Officer in charge of the Medical

Centre during the period from 01 May 2013 to 31 May 2014

did order VAW/01889 Air woman Priyadarshani PA the

stock holder of drug stores to remove the expired drugs from

the drug stocks without prior authority of the Director of

Health Services of SLAF or any other authority, pretending

that the removed drugs were issued to patients, thereby

committing an offence under section 129(1) of the Air Force

Act read in conjunction with section 43 of the said Act.

The fourth offence, Neglect to obey general or other orders, is:

[the Petitioner] at SLAF Station Katukurunda being Senior

Non Commissioned Officer in charge of the Medical Centre

during the period from 01 May 2013 to 31 May 2014 did

fail to maintain the stock of drugs contravening Para 2 of

Order No.2 issued to SNCO I/C medical section thereby

committing an offence punishable under section 102(1) of

the Air Force Act read in conjunction with section 43 of the

said Act.

After a summary trial on the above third and fourth offences, the

Petitioner was severely reprimanded for the former and

sentenced to seven days confinement to camp for the latter.

5

In my view, the whole process involving all four offences is

tainted with illegality, ultra vires and procedural impropriety.

Let me explain.

For the first offence of losing his service identity card, the

Petitioner was charged only under section 115(1)(b) of the Air

Force Act, as seen from 1R3. No other section is mentioned in

the charge sheet. If the Respondents opted to charge the

Petitioner only under the said section, then according to that

section the Petitioner should have been tried by Court Martial.

This was not done. Hence the said decision and punishment are

ultra vires.

The letter of warning 1R5, which the Respondents heavily rely

on, was served on the Petitioner as the punishment for the

second offence. This punishment was admittedly given upon

conclusion of a Court of Inquiry and not after a summary trial or

Court Martial.

According to the Air Force (Courts of Inquiry) Regulations,

promulgated under section 155 of the Air Force Act, found in

Chapter 359 in Vol. VI of the Subsidiary Legislation (1956), a

Court of Inquiry is not a body empowered to decide a matter. Its

task is to investigate and report to the convening authority, for

the convening authority to decide on the future course of action.

Upon the findings of a Court of Inquiry, punishment cannot be

imposed. For punishment to be imposed, the accused shall be

convicted on a charge sheet. But there is neither an accused

nor a charge sheet at a Court of Inquiry. It is a fact-finding

mission. This is amply clear by Regulation 2 of the Air Force

6

(Courts of Inquiry) Regulations, which states The Commander of

the Air Force or the officer in command of any unit or station may

by order in writing convene a court of inquiry for the purpose of

investigating into any matter which may be referred to it by him.

In Boniface Perera v. Lt. General Sarath Fonseka [2009] BLR 44

at 46, this Court held:

Proceedings before a Court of Inquiry in terms of the Army

Act is a preliminary step prior to a proper trial, which is

more or less a fact finding inquiry to collect and record

evidence and to submit a report. On receipt of such Court of

Inquiry proceedings or report, the Commander of the Army

could decide whether to initiate formal disciplinary

proceedings by a Court Martial or Summary Trial in terms

of provisions of the Army Act. A Court of Inquiry proceeds

on the basis of the terms of reference issued regarding the

allegation against the officer concerned. There are no formal

charges framed. Therefore based on the Court of Inquiry

proceedings it would not be within the purview of the 1st

Respondent to impose any punishment as in the case in

hand. It is essential that the person concerned should be

tried on formal charges and no punishment could be

imposed prior to framing formal charges at a legally

constituted Court Martial or Summary Trial. As such any

decision to punish based on the Court of Inquiry

proceedings would be illegal and ultra vires the provisions

of the Army Act.

7

In Lokuhennadige v. Lt. General Sarath Fonseka [2010] 2 Sri LR

85 at 93-94, this Court held:

Any punishment on the Petitioner can only be imposed after

such disciplinary inquiry. In a disciplinary inquiry a charge

sheet will be served and the person accused will have an

opportunity to answer the charges and defend himself in

contrast to a Court of Inquiry where there is no accused and

no charge sheet all those who appear before the Court of

Inquiry are witnesses as it is a fact finding inquiry. Only in

instances where the inquiry affects the character or military

reputation of an officer or a soldier the officer or a soldier

was afforded an opportunity of being present throughout

the inquiry and allowed to cross-examine any witness,

make statements and adduce evidence on his own behalf.

But this opportunity given to an officer or soldier will not

change the character of the Court of Inquiry into a

disciplinary inquiry.

The same conclusion was reached in Colonel Fernando v. Lt.

General Fonseka [2010] 2 Sri LR 101.

Therefore, serving a letter of warning on the Petitioner as the

punishment upon the findings of the Court of Inquiry is ultra

vires. The 1st Respondent cannot make use of the said letter to

discharge the Petitioner from service.

The third and fourth offences referred to earlier are offences

respectively punishable under sections 129(1) and 102(1) of the

Air Force Act.

8

Section 129(1), which deals with Conduct prejudicial to air-

force discipline, reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section,

every person subject to this Act who, by any act, conduct,

disorder, or neglect, prejudices good order and air-force

discipline, shall be guilty of an air-force offence and shall,

on conviction by a court martial, be liable, if he is an officer,

to be cashiered or to suffer any less severe punishment in

the scale set out in section 133, and, if he is an airman, to

suffer simple or rigorous imprisonment for a term not

exceeding three years or any less severe punishment in the

scale set out in section 133.

Section 102(1), which deals with Neglect to obey general or

other orders, reads as follows:

Every person subject to this Act who neglects to obey any

general, local or other order shall be guilty of an air-force

offence and shall, on conviction by a court martial, be liable,

if he is an officer, to be cashiered or to suffer any less

severe punishment in the scale set out in section 133, and,

if he is an airman, to suffer simple or rigorous imprisonment

for a term not exceeding three years.

As the above sections stipulate, charges under both offences are

triable by Court Martial. However, the charges against the

Petitioner under sections 129(1) and 102(1) were framed to be

read with section 43 of the Act, and a summary trial instead of a

Court Martial was conducted. If a summary trial is held, upon

9

conviction, the accused cannot be cashiered and only less severe

punishment can be meted out. Section 43 runs as follows:

Where a commanding officer deals summarily with a case

in which an airman (not being a warrant officer) under his

command is charged with the commission of any offence,

he shall, after hearing the evidence, acquit the accused if he

finds the accused not guilty, or convict the accused if he

finds the accused guilty, and after conviction of the accused

may

(a) (i) if the commanding officer is of the rank of

Wing Commander or of higher rank, order the

accused to be placed under detention, or

imprisonment, for a period not exceeding ninety

days, and such order of imprisonment shall not

take effect until it is ratified by the Commander

of the Air Force;

(ii) if the commanding officer is of a rank

subordinate to Wing Commander, order the

accused to be placed under detention for a

period not exceeding twenty-eight days; or

(b) if the offence is drunkenness, order him to pay a

fine not exceeding twenty rupees, either in addition to

or without any other punishment; or

(c) in addition to or without any other punishment,

order him to suffer any such deduction from his pay

10

as is authorized by this Act to be made by the

commanding officer; or

(d) where he is not a non-commissioned officer and

the offence has been committed by him while on

active service, subject him to field punishment for a

period not exceeding twenty-eight days in accordance

with such regulations relating to field punishment as

may be made, and, in addition to or without any

other punishment, order him to forfeit all pay for a

period commencing on the day of the order and not

exceeding twenty-eight days; or

(e) in addition to or without any other punishment,

subject him to such minor punishment as the

commanding officer is authorized to inflict by

regulations made in that behalf, so however that a

minor punishment shall not be inflicted for any

offence for which detention exceeding seven days is

ordered.

Hence, on the strength of the convictions for the third and

fourth offences, the Petitioner could not have been discharged

on the ground Service No Longer Required.

Let me quote paragraph 18 of the corresponding affidavit of the

Commander of the Air Force to understand the basis upon

which the impugned decision to discharge the Petitioner was

made.

11

In particular, answering the averments in sub paragraph (d)

of paragraph 14 of the petition, the respondents state that

the administrative action of discharging the petitioner from

service on Service No Longer Required was made in terms

of section 126 of the Air Force (Regular and Regular

Reserve) Regulations of 1951 considering the entirety of the

past record of offences of the petitioner and not merely on

the incident highlighted in paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the

petition, which evidently does not amount to an excessive

punishment disproportionate to the offence.

It is clear from the above, without any shadow of doubt, the

Petitioner was discharged from the Air Force on the said

convictions. The decision is ultra vires and therefore a nullity.

I quash the decision by certiorari.

In view of the above averment in the affidavit of the Commander

of the Air Force, there is no necessity in this case to consider

whether the Commander has standalone authority (despite any

defects in the convictions for the offences) to discharge an

Airman under (xiii) of Table B of the Fifth Schedule read with

Regulation 126(1) published in the Gazette marked 1R6.

There is also no necessity to consider the other arguments

mounted by learned Counsel for the Petitioner on the doctrine of

double jeopardy and proportionality of punishment.

For the aforesaid reasons, I grant the relief prayed for in

paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. The application of

the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
