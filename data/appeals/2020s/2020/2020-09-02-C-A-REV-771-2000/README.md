9~ Defendants filed tileir joint statement of claim and dle amended

statement of claim, admitting tilat the land sought to be partitioned is

depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 2516 made by Mr. L.

Galappathitili, Licensed Surveyor. They pleaded that dle original owner

of the land sought to be partitioned is one Annakkanage Disiliya and

claimed tileir undivided rights according to tile pedigree pleaded in tileir

statements of claim. After tile demise of tileir registered attorney, Mr.

Shelton Dias, dle 8"' Defendant filed a separate statement of claim

disputing dle correctness of the Preliminary Plan and stating tilat the

land sought to be partitioned is depicted in the Survey Plan No. 784

dated 22.04.1996 made by Mr. S.D. Ediriwickrema, Licensed Surveyor.

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA P/12519

oril{inal Plaintill; the a"', (j"', 8"', 10'" ami I !i'" Defendant'i. However, the

rel,ristered attorneys lor the Plaintilf, the :-3'" and the 8'" Delendants

ol~jected to the said motion while the registered attorney lor the 10'" ,lIId

IS" Delendants only stated that she had no instructions lium their

clients. (Vide- page 2aO of the record).

Application to withdraw the PlaintifPs action

1101 When the case was taken up lor trial on 2:-3.0:-3.1999, the

Intervenient Petitioners lirst moved to withdraw their claim but no order

was made either allowing or disallowing the application. Thereafter, the

original Plaintilf moved to withdraw the partition case but no order was

made either allowing or disallowing the application. Later, on the same

day, the original 8'" and ~) '" Delendants inl(>rIned Court that they were

prepared to proceed with the action as per the journal enD)' dated

2:-3.0:-1.1999. The District Court made made order naminl{ the 8'" and 9'"

Dclendants as substituted Plaintills and the original Plaintilf as the IT"

Delendant. Thereati:er, the matter was re-lixed I()r trial on 21.1 0.1 ~)99.

the Trial

1II1 When the case was taken up trial on 21.10.1999, the substituted

Plaintills (8'" and 9'" Defendants) were absent and their lawyer inl(>rIned

Court that he had no instructions from them. However, the Counsel for

the Intervenient-Petitioners liled the statement of claim of the

Intervenient-Petitioners and the District Court made order adding them

as I H"', 19'" and 20'" Defendants. The 18'" Defendant who was added as a

party dclendant that morninl{ itself was called to give evidence by the

Counsel for the 18-20 Defendants on the basis of a settlement between

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII2519

Judgment

1121 On 13.03.2000, the learned Additional Dist:rictJudge delivered the

judgment in open COUlt and directed that the land depicted in the

Preliminary Plan No. 2516 be partitioned according to the evidence

given by the 18'" Defendant. The 17"' Defendant-Petitioner, I A

Defendant-Petitioner and the 3'" Defendant-Petitioner have filed this

application seeking to set aside all proceedings that had taken place after

the ori/,rinal Plaintiff had moved on 23.03. 1999 to withdraw the action

and dismiss the partition action.

PrelimIDary Objections

11 31 The 8"' and the 9- Plaintiffs-Respondents filed their objections and

while denying all and singular the several averments contained in the

Petition raised the following main preliminary objections to the

maintainability or this application.

I. The Petitioners have failed to file the ori/,rinals or certified copies

of all the relevant documents in terms of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990;

2. The Petitioners are guilty of laches;

:-l. There ,uoe no exceptional circumstances for the Court to act in

revision or to exercise the powers of revision or restitutio in

intergrum; and

4. The Petitioners have suppressed and misrepresented material

fact~.

1141 All parties agreed to deal with the prelimimu), objections together

with the main matters and accordingly, on 16.06.2020, Mr. Manoh;uoa de

Silva, P.C. made submissions in support of the preliminary objections

raised on behalf of tJ1e 8"' ,md 9"' Plaintin~Respondents as well as the main

C.A. REV 077100 D.C. MATARA P/12519

matters raised by the Petitioners in their Petition. Dr. Sunil Cooray

submitted that there was no merit in the preliminary ol~jections and

further made submissions with regard to the main matters raised by the

Petitioners in their Petition.

Failure to file the originals or certified copies of the relevant documents

11 51 The preliminary ol~jection of the H'" and 9'" PlaintilTs- Respond e n L~

was that the Petitioners have not Ii led originals or certitied copies of the

proceedings dated 2:~.03.1999 and daled 21.10.1999 including the

jud/,'lTIent dated I B.OB.2000 in violation of the Courl of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

II GI Rule 3 (l) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990 slates that:

"/,'1 'elY application made to dIe COUit olAppeal /()r d7e exercil'c of' pOlven vestcd IiI die COUll of Appeal hy Altic/es 140 and 141 of'the

1171 The Petitioners have marked and prod uced a certilied copy of all

relevant d ocument~ including the Plaint, statemenls of claims, Plans and

Reports, proceedings dated 21,10,1999, all availahle deeds filed of

record, (A2-A25) except the proceedings and the judgement dated

1 3,O:~,2000 . The Petitioners have slated in paragraph Hi of the Petition

dated 17,07.2000 that they applied lilr a celtilied copy of the jud/,'lTIent

CAREY - 077 1-00 D,C. MA TARA PI12519

dated 13.03.2000 but found that the judgment was not available in the

case record as at the date of the Petition filed in the Court of Appeal on

17.07.2000. The Petitioners have further stated in paragraph 16 of the

Petition that their present registered attorney personally perused the

record, but found no judgment in the case record till 11.15 a.m. on

13.07.2000. Paragraph 16 of the Petition is as follows:

1 6~J3ut die Petitiollers state WldJ re!>pect dJal up to date, dJere is no .iudgmellt or lilteJiocutOlY decree Iii d7e record. 77Je Petitioner files

1181 In SUppOit of their contention, the Petitioners have filed an affidavit

marked A26 fi'om their present registered attorney confirming the fact

that she had personally perused the case record but found that the

judl,'TI1ent was not filed of record till 11.15 a.m. on the 13"'July 2000. The

Petitioners' attorney-at-law has stated in her affidavit (A29) that although

she through one Engonona applied for a certified copy, she could not

obtain the same and the deeds filed in this application are all documents

filed of record in the District Court case record.

If91 The Petitioners have explained the reason fi)r the delay in filing this

application and stated in the Petition that the delay in making the

application was due to the difficulty in ascertaining the facts, obtaining

copies of the relevant documents and and obtaining a copy of the

judgment. Para/,'Taph 20 of the Petition is as follows:

20- 77Jese Petitiollers submit, IVld7 respect, that the delay liJ makiiJg

dJJ:5 applicauoIJ was due to dJe (hfficulty Ii] ascertaJilli7g dJe i-icl3 liJ

heen entered in tilis Glse and heg lilat tiley he excused ;IS such fiJI" lile delay Irany. "

1201 On 13.02.2001, the Petitioners have libl an affida\~t in this Court

stating inter alia that after liling this application and upon a further

perusal of the District Court record, they have been able to obtain copies

of the proceedings of 1:-3.0:-1.2000 and liled a certilied copy of the

proceedings ,U1d the judgment dated 1 :-1.0:-1.2000 marked as A2R and

A29.

1211 On an application made by the Petitioners to call lur the oril,rinal

case record from the District Court of Matara, this Court on 0 1.11.200j

made order calling for the original case record. A perusal of the oril,rinal

case record reveals that the judl,'lnent dated 13.0:1.2000 is palt and parcel

of the proceedings dated 1 :1.03.2000 ,lnd hence, the proceedings dated

13.0:-1.2000 include the judl,'lnent dated I :1.0a.2000 as well. A perusal of

the original case record further reveals that the learned Additional

District judge had delivered the judl,'lnent in open court on 13.03.2000

but the unsigned proceedings and the unsil,'lled judgment had been

handed over to the Record Room only on 12.07.2000 (Vide- the Rubber

Seal or the Record Room dated 12.07.2(00). A perusal or the original

case record lurther reveals that the unsigned proceedings and the

judgment dated 1:1.03.2000 had been Ii led or record only on 14.07.2000

(Vide- the minute or the Record Keeper or the Binder dated 14.07.2000

on the Idt hand side of the journal entry No. 72 dated 1:-l.0:-1.2000.

1221 The Rubber Seal or the Recorel Room dated 12.07.2000 and the

minute or the Record Keeper or the Binder dated 14.07.2000 clearly

conlinn without any doubt that ,tlthough the judgment may have

pronounced in open Court on 1:1.0:1.2000, dle unsigned typed judgment

and the unsil,'l1ed proceedings dated 1:-l.03.2000 h,ld been h,lI1ded over to

C.A. REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI12519

the Record Room only on 12.07.2000 and the same had been filed of

record only on 14.07.2000. It is abundantly clear til at the unsigned

proceedings and tile unsigned judgnlent dated 13.03.2000 were not

available in tile original case record fi'om 13.03.2000 to 14.07.2000. This

confirms tile position of tile registered attorney of the Petitioners that tile

judgment was not available in the case record on tile 13.07.2000 and

thus, the Petitioners cannot be faulted for not filing a certified copy of

the proceedings and the judgment which was not available in tile case

record by tile time the Petitioner's registered attorney applied for a

certified copy of the same.

1231 I hold tllat the Petitioners have sufficiently explained tile reason for

not filing a certified copy of the proceedings and the judgement along

witll their Petition on 17.07.2000. Subsequently, they had obtained a

certified copy of the judgment together witll the proceedings dated

13.03.2000 and tendered to tile Court by way of aflidavits. For tllose

reasons, I am not inclined to agree with the submission of Mr. de Silva

tllat the Petitioner must be held liable for the failure to file a certified

copy of the proceedings and tile judl,'lTIent dated 13.03.2000 along with

tlle Petition in violation of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure)

Rules 1990.

Other Preliminary Objections

1241 In my \~ew, the otller preliminary objections are closely related to

the main matters raised by the Petitioners and the 8"' and 9"' Plaintifl~

Respondents and hence, they will be dealt with along widl the main

matters.

Failure to dismiss the partition action upon the application of the original

Plaintiff to withdraw the action

C.A.REV - 077 1-00 D.C. MATARA P/12519

1251 At the hearing, Or. Sunil Coo ray strenuously argued that when the

Plaintilf sought to withdraw the action, the learned Additional District

Judge should have dismissed the partition action without permitting the

8'" and 9'" DefenchUlts to prosecute the partition action as the conditions

stipulated in the proviso to sub-section (I) of section 70 were not satislied.

Dr. Cooray submitted that the proviso permits a Delcndant to prosecute

a parlition action only where the Plaintilf l;lils or neglects to prosecute a

partition action and in the instant case, the oril,rinal Plaintifr had not I;liled

or neglened to prosecute the partition. His contention was thal since the

PlaintilT moved to withdraw the partition anion, it was not open to the

District Court to permit the 8'" and 9'" Defendants to prosecute the action

under the provisions of the Partition I.aw.

12(il Or. Cooray strongly relied on lhe judgment of the Court of Appeal

in Amar;/SJilghe I '. Po(/Jinenike and OlheI:5 (1997) I Sri LR. 349 III

support of the submission that when a Plaintitr deliberately moves to

withdraw a partition action, it is not open to the District Court to permit a

Defendant to prosecute the partition action. In Amaraslilglic I'.

Po(/Jinelllke alld OdIeI:\' (Supra), Edussuriya, j. staled at page 350:

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI125 19

1271 On the other hand, Mr. de Silva drew out attention to the statement

or claim jointly filed by tile 8"' and 9"' Defendants dated 21.05.1987 and

the amended statement or claim jointed filed by tile 8"' and 9"

Defendants on 26.11.1990 wherein tlley had asked for a partition of the

land in suit according to their shares set out in tlleir statement of claim.

Mr. de Silva further submitted that where a Defendant had asked for a

partition of the land which is the subject of tile action, it is open to the

District Court to permit a Defendant to prosecute a partition case under

suh-section (2) or section 70 and hence, the judgment in Amar;lSIi7gi7e v.

Porhinemke and Others (Supra) has no application to tile present case.

1281 In view of the submissions made by Dr. Cooray and Mr. de Silva, I

am now called upon to decide the question whether it is open to the

District Court to permit the original 8"' and 9"' Defendant~ to prosecute

the partition action when the original Plaintill moved to withdraw the

action.

1291 The intention of the Parliament in introducing section 70 of the

Partition Law can be gathered ti-OITI tile nature, character, purpose and

oqject of the partiLion action. The concept of judicial proceedings for

partition or sale is that of dissolving tile bond of common ownership by

alienation of tile co-owner's shares (CeyloIl Theatres Ltd v. Cinemas Ltd

(70 NLR 337 at 339). It seems that tile partition action is instituted lor the

purpose of putting an end to the common ownership and lor that

purpose, ,Ul obligaLion is imposed on tile COUl1 by endeavouring to

compel the p<uties to bring tile action to a termination.

1301 A pa1tition action is defined in section 83 of the Partition Law No.

21 of 1977 as <Ullencled as "an action instituted under tllis Law for tile

p<u-tition or sale or <Uly land or lands belonging in common to two or

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D_C. MATARA PI12519

,

more owners and includes any action, proceeding or other matter

continued under section 82".

1~1I1 An action and cause of action are defined in section 5 or the Civil

Procedure Code. An action is "proceeding filr the prevention or redress

of a wrongf and a cause or action is "the wrong l(lI' the prevention or

redress or which an action may be brought and includes the denial or a

right, the refusal to fultil an ohligation the neglect to perfilrm a duty and

the intliction or an allirmative iqjury". However, a partition action is not

an action founded upon a wrong or a cause or action as defined in section

5, hut it would be an action under the definition of action under section

(j, which is an "application to a court ror relier or remedy obtainable

through the exercise of the court's pOlVer or authority or otherwise to

invite its interference". A partition action may be htirly said to be a

proceeding instituted by one co-owner to secure a divided holding or the

common property rrom joint ownership or to ohtain his share in the

proceeds or sale of the common land.

1321 For this reason, a partition action has heen recognized as a special

character as all the parties have the double capacity or PI,tintifl and

Defendant ( VoCI X. I. iii & i3;UJdll N;lIdc I '. Appli Naidc e/ ai (192:1) :1

C.L. Ret'. 192) and thus, he who first hrough the action is taken to be Ule

Plaintiff (Wcenuwoll e/. ;U v. W;lrlS 57 NLR 25). In that sense, in a

partition action, all the parties are Plaintills (De 'sili'a 1'. Dc .~ika a

C.\V.R. 318). When any land helongs in common to two or more

owners, ,lIlY one or more of them, whether or not his or their ownership

is sul~ject to any life interest in any oUler person, may institute a partition

action to put an end to ownership in common hecause of the increased

inconvenience of possession of the land in common.

CAREY - 0771-00 D,C. MATARA PI12519

1331 Section 70 of the Partition Law as amended by Partition

(Amendment) Act No. 17 of 1997 is intencled to promote this legislative

intent and ensure that once a partition action is filed, it shall not abate by

reason of non-prosecution of the action. To achieve this legislative intent,

it imposes an obligation on the Partition Court to use all reasonable

endeavours by compelling the parties to bring the action to a termination.

Section 70 provides as follows:

U(i). No p<utitioll ilction shall abate by reason at dIe 1l01l-plVSeCUU(}/] dlereoJ,' but, IIa pal1itioll acu"oll is Ilot plVsecuted Wldl reasollable dIligence a!i.er dIe COUlt has enrleal'OUled to compel dIe parties to bnilg tile acUon to a tennIilaUOn, tile COUlt may dism/~".5 tile acUon:

1341 The legislative intent of the Partition Law for the promotion of

partition is reflected in sub-section (I), which clearly imposes an obligation

on the Court to use all reasonable endeavours by compelling the parties to

bring the action to a termination. On the other hand, the proviso to sub-

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII2519

section (I) permil~ the Coul1 to permit any other Delt:ndant to prosecute

the action where the Plaintifr f;uls or neglects to prosecute the action.

1 :~5 1 Dr. Cooray strongly relied on the words "where a plaintiff fails or

neglects to prosecute a partition action" alld argued that where there is no

evidence that the Plaintiff had f;liled or neglected to prosecute the action, a

Defendant cannot he permitted to prosecute the action imd substitute him

as a Plaintiff under the proviso to sub-section (I). Dr. Cooray further

submitted that in the instant case, the Plaintiff deliberately sought to

withdraw the action and hence, the dismissal of the action is automatic as

the Plaintiff had not failed or neglected to prosecute the action. His

contention was that the action shall be dismissed irrespective of the blCt

that the other Dcfend;mts who sought a partition moved that they be

permitted to prosecute the action.

1:1(il The lel"rislative intent should not be gathered by reading the proVISO

alone, but it has to be gathered by reading section 70 in its entirety, the

context, the object and purpose of the partition and iL~ operation to achievc

the legislative intent. I am not inclined to agree with the submission that

where the Plaintiff moves to withdraw the partition action, the policy of the

partition law is that the dismissal is automatic, whether the other parties

asked for a partition. I shall give my reasons.

1:171 It is not in dispute that Oil 2 :~ .():1 jI)<)<), the Plaillliff mOl'ed to

withdraw the action Oil the 4'" trial date without prior noticc to the other

defendants, but the lcamed Additiollal District Judge did not dismiss the

actioll but allowed the origina l H'" alld e)'" ))eIClldallts to prosecute the

actioll. Sub-seclioll (I) of sectioll 70 as amended by the Partitioll

C.A.REY - 0771-00 D.C. MAlARA P/ 125 19

prosecution after it had endeavoured to compel the other parties to bring

the action to a termination sul~ject ho\Ve\'er, to the proviso.

laHI The prO\'iso permits a Defendant to prosecute the partition action

where the Plaintifr lails or neglects to prosecute the partition action. It is

a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision or

a statute only embraces the lield which is covered by the main provision

and thus, it carves out an exception to the main prO\'ision to which it has

been enacted as a proviso and to no other (Ram Naraill SOilS lid I '. Assl

(i)mmr oFSaft:s -lax AIR 19:;5 SC 7(5). A prO\'iso, however, can only

operate to deal with a case, which would have litllen within t.he ambit or

the section to which it is a proviso (Bindra's Interpretation or Statutes,

10'" Ed. pag-e 127). A proviso must be considered in relaLion to the

principal matter to which it stands as a pro\'iso and thus, the section mu~t

be read along with the pro\'iso as a whole (Stale o/PUJ!lii/) I' K;ll/ash iValh

AIR 1~JH9 1 SC .'i.'iH WJH9).

1 :1~)1 It is a fundamental rule of construction that a provIso must be

considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stlllds as it

proviso and thus. it is to be construed harmoniously with the main

enactment as a pro\'iso is subselyient to the main provision (Bindra's

Interpretation of Statutes, 10,1, Ed. p. 187 & SouU) As/;/ Illdl/slnes PI'! Ltd

I. ,";/I'L1!J ,~/i/gh A IR 19(j(i SC :H9). The territory of the proviso,

therd()I'(':, is to Guye out in an exception to the main enactment and

exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section

and thus, it has to operate in the same lield (Bin(iI-a's Interpretation of

Statutes, Supra).

HOI It seems that bd()re a provIso to sub-section (l) can have any

application, the sub-section (l) which contains the legislative intent or

~ection 70 itself must be considered lirst and the proviso must be

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D,C, MATARA PII2519

considered in rdation to the principal section to IVhich it stands as a

prOl'iso. The idea is that in an)' c\'ent, a pw\'iso to ,ui>-section (I) cannot

be used to ddcat the basis intent expressed in the suhstanti\'e pro\'ision

in sub-,ection (I) of ,ection 70 or the Partition La\\,.

1411 In PCli7:S' and OdleJ:5 I '. Chandrasena and odlen~ (1999) a Sri LR. 1 !i:~,

Gunawardena,.J. emphasized the legislative intent in introducing section 70

or the Partition Law and ohligation imposed by dle Court by endeavouring

to compel the parties to bring the action to an end at page l!i(i as follows:

"It i'i 1o be obsclverl lhat section 70 quoted above, sl.ates Oil all cmphalic lIole, dial 110 p;uvlioll actioll shall abate by reasoll 0(11011-PIVSCCUlioll of dIe same ;lIJd Ii imposes a duly Oil lhe Cowt to

1421 Gunawardena,./. further emphasized the need to follow the mandatory

requirements or section 70 before a partition action is dismissed and stated

at page 1.'i 7:

14~~ 1 In K. S. VI('!or 1'. W /. Ti5sera (C.A 374/2000) decided on

12.10.201!i), Nawaz,'/' has also observed the policy of section 70 of the

Partition I.aw at page 14 as follows:

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D,C. MATARA PII2519

1441 The plain words of sub-section (1) of section 70 make it very clear that

it is the duty of the Court to use all endeavours to compel the parties to

bring the action to a termination and a partition action can only be

dismissed lor non-prosecution after the COUlt has endeavoured to compel

the p<u"ties to bring the action to a termination. This means that the Judge

is obliged to make every endeavour and compel the parties who sought a

p<utition to bring the action to an end before he could resort to the harsh

sanction of dismissal of the paltition action.

1451 In the present case, the Plaintilf mOl'ed to wilhdraw the action on

2:1.0:-3. 1999 without specifying any reason whalsoel'er and withoul lIolice

lo the other parties. If the wilhdrawal is permilted ullder such

circumslances, the c1kctll'ould be that in the eye of the law. the partition

actioll is dismis,ed alld the action is termillated as no partition action is

lib!.

1461 In Am;u-;wilghe v PoriIinemke and Od7ers (supra), the Court of

Appeal held that when there is a deliberate act of withdrawal of the

partition action, it is not open to the Defendant who had asked lor a

dismissal of the action to proceed to prosecute the action. Here, it is

dillerenl. In the present case, there ,u"e sen:ral parties who had asked lilr

a partition of lhe land ill suit and thus, beli)re the action is dismissed, a

duty was cast 011 the Districl.ludge under sub-seclioll (I) of section 70 to

prOlide el'ery reasonable opportunity to the parties who had asked lilr a

partitioll alld usc el'ery endeavours to cornpcl them to bring the action to

a lermillation.

1471 It is open to the Court to dismiss a partition action only in the event of

the parties who had asked for a partition expressing an intention not to

prosecute the action after dle Court had given all reasonable opportunities

<Uld endeavoured to compel dlem to bring the action to a termination.

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII2519

l

t

When one of the Defendant who had sought a partition of the action

indicates his willingness to prosecute the action, any dismissal of the

partition action is inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed in suh-

section (I) of section 70 of the P,u-tition Law which stipulates that a

dismissal may he allowed only afier the Court had endeavoured to compel

the parties to bring the action t.o a termination.

1481 I hold that the power of the District Court to dismiss a partition action

upon the withdrawal shall he exercised only after every reasonahle

opportunity had heen given to all the panics who asked for a p;u1ition and

after using every reasonable endeavours to compel the parties to hring the

action to a termination. However, where all the Delendants had ,L~ked for a

dismissal of the action, the Court has no option hut to dismiss the action

without permitting a Defendant to proceed to prosecute the action as

observed by Eddusuriya J in Amarasinghe v. Podimenike and Others

(Supra).

I'~()I Section 70 of tlle Partition La\\" reqllm:s tklt in the case where a

plaintiff neglects or filib to pro,e('ute a partition action. the Court may. by

order permit any Defendant to prosecute that action. In order to achiC\'e

this, the District Judge may substitute the Def"endant who is desirou, of

continuing with tlle action as suhstituted Plaintiff. The same principle

applies where a PI,lintiff 11I00'ed to withdraw the action and a Deknd;ull

who asked i()r a partition indicates his willingness to prosecute the action.

1501 If the District Court is obliged to dismiss the partition action far a

mere application of a Plaintiff to withdraw the action, disreg-,mling any

intention of a Delendant who had asked f()r a partition of carrying on with

the action, it is obviously inconsistent with the spirit, object and purpose of

section 70 (I) of the Partition Law. Such a course of action, in my view, was

not contemplated by the legislature in introducing section 70 of the

CAREV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII25 19

Partition Law. To take a contrary view, would certainly defeat the legislative

intent expressed in sub-section (I) of section 70 of the Partition Law and

take away the oblig-ation imposed on the District.Iudge by endeavouring to

compel the parties to bring the action to a termination.

1511 At the hearing, Dr. Cooray and Mr. Sahabandu submitted that the 9"

Defendant who had been pelmitted to prosecute the case along with the 8"

Defendant was neither present nor represented alter Mr. Shelton Perera

passed away and hence, the District COUlt should not have permitted the

9" Defendant to prosecute the case along with the 8" Delendant.

1521 It seems that after the demise of Mr. Shelton Perera (Vide-].E 67

dated 1:3.05.1996), the 9" Defendant had not been represented and

thereafter, the District Court issued notice on the 9- Defendant to be

present in COUlt on 04.05.1998. The Journal Entry No. 67 clearly indicates

Ulat though the notice was served on Ule 9" Defendant, she was absent and

unrepresented on the notice returnable date on 04.05.1998 or Ulereafi:er.

15:31 When Ule case was taken up lor trial on 2:3.0:3.1999, the Plaintiff

moved to wiUldraw the action, the learned District.Iudge had recorded that

the 8" and 9" Defendants informed him Ulat they wished to prosecute the

action. The relevant journal entry No. 68 dated 2:3.03.1999 reads as

1541 A perusal of the record reveals that the 8"' DeICndant had been

represented by Mr. Barty Jayaweera on 2:1.0:1. EJ99 but the 9'" Defend;mt

was neither present nor represented on 2:1.0:-3.f999. She had not taken any

steps to retain a rel,ristered attorney even after she was noticed hy the

District Court to he present in Court. The H'" and 9'" Plaintiffs-Respondents

in their ol~jections had never denied the position of the Petitioners in

(><lragraph 7 of the Petition which states thaI aller the notice was served on

the <J'" Ddendant, she did not come to Court thereafter or retain a

reg-istered attorney to represent her on 2:1.0:1.1999.

1551 The 8'" and 9"' Plaintills-Respondents in their o~jections had admitted

Ule bare malters of record in paragraph 7 of the Petition and denied the

rest of Ule averments. They had never taken up the position in their

ol~jections that the 9"' Defendant was presenl in Court on 2:-l.0:-l.f9~)9 and

indicated her willingness to prosecute the case along with the 8"' DeICndant.

It seems to me that the 9"' Defendant was neither present nor represented

in Court on 2:1.0:1. EJ99 and thus, she never indicated her willingness to

prosecute the action along with the 8'" Defendant when the Plaintiff moved

to withdraw the partition action. On the odler hand, Ule registered attorney

for the 8'" Defendant had no authority to make any application on her

behalf when she had not given a proxy to appear for her on 2:1.10.1999 in

Court.

1561 For those reasons, I am inclined to agree with the submission of Dr.

Cooray and Mr. Sahabanclu that the learned DistrictJudge should not have

permitted the 9"' Defendant to prosecute the <lction along WiUl the 8'"

Defendant.

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA P/ 12519

1571 However, Ule application made by ilie original 8"' Defendant to

prosecute the case is different. Boili Dr. Coorary ,md Mr. Sahabandu

conceded Ulat Ule original 80h Detendant had retained Mr. Berty layaweera

after ilie demise of Mr. Shelton Dias, filed an amended statement of claim

and prayed for a partition of the land in suit. It is not in dispute Ulat the

ori/,rinal 8"' Defendant indicated her willingness to prosecute Ule p,utition

action as borne out by the record in Ule presence of her attorney who

represented her on 23.10.1999.

1581 As noted, the policy of Ule partition law is to grant relief against

increased inconvenience of common propel1y by means of bringing the

action to a telmination and ilie dismissal of ilie partition action eiUler for

non-prosecution or mere application to ,\~ilidraw Ule action is not ilie

le/,rislative intent when ollieI' parties are ,,~lling to prosecute Ule action. It is

for Ulat purpose, section 70 (I) imposes an obli!f<ltion on Ule Judge to

provide every reasonable opportunity to ilie parties who asked for a

partition and use every endeavour to compel ilie parties to bring the action

to a termination.

1591 This partition action was filed in f 984 and after the Preliminary Pl,m

was prepili'ed, ilie substituted lA (ilie present lA Defendant-Petitioner)

and Ule original 2'" Detend,mt also took out a commission and prepared

ilie Plan No. 784 dated 22.04. 1996. Several pilities intervened and filed

Uleir statements of claim, including Ule ori/,rinal a'", 6''', 8"' and 9"'

Defendants ilild sought a partition while ilie 11"' to 14"' Defendililts also

sought a partition as ,m alternative relief. The case was first fixed for trial

on 23.07.1991 and postponed on several occasions. The application for

the withdrawal of the action was made by ilie Plaintiff on 23.03.1999 when

ilie pili-ties had litigated for 15 years.

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII2519

,

IGOI The Petitioners now seek to cause further inconvenience to the other

parties who litigated lix more than I fj years and deprive them of having to

put the common ownership to an end because of the increased

inconvenience of common possession. Ir they are told to Ii Ie a tj'esh action

to end their inconvenience, surely, they have to begin the never-ending

proceeding from the very beginning by spending an enormous amount of

money, time and elrort, all LO the detriment to the parties and their heirs.

IGII For those reasons, I hold that the learned District./udge has correctly

given elfcct to the Iq,rislative intent expressed in sub-section (1) of section

70 of the Partition Law and properly exercised his discretion by permitting

the original 8'" De!enclant who asked I()I' a partition, to prosecute the action

and substituting the 8th Defendant as a I'laintilr in the action.

Legality of the Settlement upon whieh the Judgment was entered

Ifi21 At the hearing Dr. Coo ray strenuously argued that the trial was

conducted on 21.10.1999 in /,'1'OSS violation of the procedure laid down in

the Partition Law and the Civil Procedure Code causing a miscarriage of

justice to the parties I()r the 1()lIowing reasons:

I. The 18-20the Delendants liled a statement of claim without serving

copies on the other parties and were added just on the morning of

the trial date on 21.1 0.199~) and thus, the case was not ready for trial

as the other parties did not have adequate notice of the nature of

their case. There was a total I;tilure on the part of the District Court

in not re-lixing the case l()r trial lor another day under section 24 (2)

of the Partition Law in order to enable the parties to get ready I()r

trial in view of the addition of the new parties that morning ibelf;

2. The 18'" dclendant who was added as a delCndant in the case just

that morning commenced giving evidence stating that all disputes in

CAREV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PII2519

the case had been settled when there was no agreement between the

parties and most of the parties including the substituted Plaintiffs

were absent and their registered attorneys informing that they had no

instructions from their clients;

3. The IS"' Defendant f~liled to satisfy that the coq)US of the action is

properly depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 2516 made by the

Court Commissioner and the 18"' Defendant failed to produce the

Preliminary Plan <md what was produced at the trial was only the

Second Plan No. 7S4 prepared by Surveyor Mr. Ediriwickrema;

't. The land sought to be partitioned is in extent of S acres whereas the

land depicted in the Preliminary Plan is in extent of 4 acres 3 roods

and 25 perches. The learned Districtludge has failed to identify the

corpus of the action in the light of a discrepancy between the land

sought to be partitioned and the land. depicted in the preliminary

Plan;

5. There was no investigation of the title of tlle parties by tlle learned

District] udge who had btiled to determine tlle shares of the parties

and give reasons for tlle findings in total disregard of the provisions

of the Partition Law; and

6. AltllOugh several deeds were marked at the trial by tlle IS"'

Defendant, only few Deeds were produced and the judgment had

been delivered witllOUt considering all the Deeds marked by the IS"'

Defendant at the trial.

Testimony of the 18"' Defendant on the basis of a Settlement

1631 A perusal of tlle record reveals that when the case was taken up for

trial on 21.10.1999, the originalS'" <md 9"' Defendants who were substituted

as Plaintifls on 23.03. 1999 were absent and their lawyer informed tlle

Court tllat he had no instructions (i'om them. Thereafter, the Intervenient

C.A.REV . 077 100 D.C. MATARA P/ 12519

Petitioners (18-20 Defendants) who withdrew their application on

2:1.0:-3.1999 (Vide- .I.E. No. G8 dated 2a.O :~.1 ~)~)9) were allowed to lile their

statement of claim and they were added as 18'" to 20'10 Defendants by the

learned Additional District.ludge.

1(i41 Strangely, tJle 18'10 Defendant who was just added as a party delelHl;mt

that morning itself commenced giving evidence in a most unsatislactory,

irresponsible and shocking manner, stating that all disputes in the case had

been setrled (@@@ m~EJ 63@ 8oo@ ep6~ el@()wO eJ05~ ~~O). ~ ~@eJ

el)l:i5~ @@@I5lweJm )eJ i5)al) 8BmeJ)) in gross violation of section 91 and 408

of the Civil Procedure Code. It seems without doubt, that the evidence of

tJle 18'10 Defendant was led on the basis of a purported settlement or

agreement between tJle parties when the substituted Plaintills and several

other Delendants including the 1 A defendant, tJle 4", 5", (i", 1 0'10 and 11"

Defendants were absent and their registered attorneys informing tJle

DistricL.! udge that they had no instructions li'om their clients.

I(iSI It is to be observed that the learned Additional District Judge had

permitted the 18'10 Defendant to lead evidence immediately alter the 18'10 to

20" Delendants were allowed to file the statement of claim and added as

new parties that morning itself without providing an adequate time to

examine the nature of the pedigree pleaded by the 18"' to 20" Defendants

in their statement of claim and obtain instructions from the parties. It was

obvious that the case was not ready for trial on 21.10.1999 in view of the

addition of the new parties whose statement of claim was accepted only on

that morning and the substituted PlaintiflS were absent and their lawyer had

no instructions.

I (i(i I Section 24 (2) of the Partition law reads as I()llows:

CAREY - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI12519

"On dJe day apPOJiIled under subseclion (1), oFdJ/!j seclion or where it appears to dIe court dIat dJe case is not ready for lliai, on nay later date to which the malter shall on dJat dale have been postponed, dIe COUlt shall fix dIe dale of ll1aJ of evelY p;utition aellon ill open

COUlt. "

1671 Under such special circumstances, the learned District Judge in my

view, should have exercised his discretion under section 24 (2) of the

Partition Law and re-fixed the matter for another date to enable the parties

to examine the new statement of claim and the pedigree filed by the new

parties that morning itself. On the other hand, the learned Additional

District Judge should not have permitted the f 8"' Defendant to /,rive

evidence on the basis of a purported settlement without the presence of the

parties or their representatives and without ascertaining the nature of the

settlement which was said to have been reached by the parties.

1681 The substituted 4"' Defendant-Respondent has stated in his objections

that tl1e ori/,rinal 4'" Defendant who is his mother passed away on

04.04.1995 (Vide- the Death Certificate No. 3683 which is filed of record

and marked as "B") but no steps were taken to substitute her heirs in place

of tl1e deceased 4"' Defendant. The substituted 4A Defendant-Respondent

has furtl1er stated that tlle purported settlement had been reached witllOUt

any notice to the heirs of the ori/,rinal 4m Defendant and the trial conducted

witl10ut taking steps for substituting the heirs of the 4m Defendant. He has

stated that under such circumstances, a fraud had been committed by tlle

18m Defendant in entering into a purported settlement witllOut notice to the

heirs of the 4"' Defendant and in tl1e result, the rights of the decea~ed 4"'

Defendant had been adversely aJlected.

1691 A perusal of the original Plaint reveals that the Plaintiff had given an

undivided 44/375 share to tl1e 4"' Defendant on the basis of the Deed No.

C.A.REV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI12519

8798. The I X" defendant had not produced the said Deed but only stated

that the rights of Sisiliyana vVickremasinghe who derived rights !i'om deed

No. 7() were devolved on Ule Plaintilf and the 2"" to 5'" Defendant and

moved to keep such righL~ unallotted as the Deed No 7G was not

produced. It seems to me that the purported settlement had been reached

without the knowledge of Ule heirs of the 4" Dclendant.

Judgment entered upon the Settlement

1701 A perusal of Ule unsigned judb'lnent dated I :-l.0:-l.2000 reveals that the

learned Additional District.! udge has merely stated in the judgment that (i)

he was satisfied that the land sought to be partitioned is depicted in Plan

No. 2516 dated 10.04.19X5 made by Mr. GallapathiUli; (ii) according to

the evidence adduced and Ule document~ produced at the trial, the land

sought to he partitioned is a common property; and (iii) the parties are

entitled to partition the land depicted in Plan No. 2.'i II) according to the

evidence adduced hy Ule IS'" Defendant at the trial. The unsigned

judb'lnent dated 13.m.2000 reveals tllat the judgment only contains bare

statemenL~ with no investig-dtion of the title of the parties or consideration

of tlle deeds of tlle parties or determination of the respective rights and the

shares of the parties.

1711 While conceding that the learned District./udge had I~liled to calculate

shares to he allotted to the part.ies, Mr. de Silva argued, however, that the

maximum that can be done at this stage is to direct the District Judge to

calculate the shares, according to the evidence already led at tlle trial and

pronounce the judb'lnent accordingly. Mr. de Silva strongly ol~iected to allY

fresh trial being ordered and submitted that the Petitioners cannot now

challenge the entire proceedin/,'S of the case when the case proceeded to

trial in the presence of the original Plaintilf and without a contest and no

CAREV - 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI12519

objection to ,my procedural errors in the proceedin/,'S was taken by the

original Plaintiff in the District Court.

1721 Dr. Cooray however, submitted that the evidence given by the IS"'

Defendant at the trial was based on a purported settlement between all the

parties, which is tainted with fraud and invited us to set aside tlle judgment

dated 13.03.2000 ,md order a fi'esh trial in the interest~ of justice.

1731 It is settled law that an agreement, which is entered into a partition

action, affecting only tlle rights of tlle p<uties liUer se, <Uld which is

expressly made subject to the Court: being satisfied that all parties are

entitled to interests in tlle l<Uld <U'e before it and solely entitled to it, is

binding on the p,uties and is not obnoxious to tlle P<utition Ordin<Ulce

(Kumanhamy v. \tVeerag-dlTJa 43 NLR 265). Thus, there must be a binding

a/,'reement between the parties and tlle Court must be satisfied that as to

whether the agreement is between all the parties having interests in the land

and the respective shares or interests to be given to each p<uty is based

upon tlle compromise that is so reached (RosailiJ v. MaJyhamy 1994 (3) Sri

LR 262). In GUllawardena v. RaJI MeJJJke (2000) (3) Sli LR 243,

Weerasuriya ]. stated that where there has been a settlement or

compromise, it must be in sU'iet compliance with the provisions of section

91 and section 40S of tlle Civil Procedure Code. Sections 91 and 40S of

tlle Civil Procedure Code are as follows:

.91- EvelY application made to dIe COUIt IiI dIe course ofan action, liICldentallherelo, ,wd not a slep IiI dIe regular procedure, shall be made by motion by dIe applicaJJl IiI person or IlJ:s' counselor regislered altorney, ,Uld a memorandum In wnDng of such motion shall be at dIe s;une tline delivered to dIe COUIt

10 so much a/dIe sull/ecl-maller of'dle aCllon as i, deall wliil by die

a~Teemellt, compromi\'e, oJ'sati,lilcliolJ.

1741 When a settlement is reached in a partition action, it must be clearly

indicated to the District./udge and the District./udge must also be satislied

that all parties entitled to interests in the land arc before Court or

represented ,Uld that Lhey are solely entitled to shares and that the

scLtlement is not a I()rced or imposed upon the unwilling parties,

1751 In the present case, soon alter the 18-20 Delendants were added as

new parties in the morning, the 18'" delendant got into the witness box

and her evidence was led by her Counsel on the basis Lhat "all disputes are

scLtled" witllout indicating to Court, the nature and terms or the settlement

and tlle parties who will be entitled to sh,u'es agreed upon and as to

whether the parties whose interests III the land are aHeeLed by the

settlement. A pursual or the record clearly reveals that no agreement or

terms or the settlement with regard to the corpus or tlle action, original

ownership, tlle parties who will be entitled to undivided shares or the

parties whose interests will he allected by the settlement had been

disclosed to the District Court either bcl()re or during the course or the

trial.

1761 The 18-20 DelemhUlts had in her statement or claim relied on the

pedil,'Tee set up by the 11" - 14'" DelendanLo; who had, however, not I,';ven

shares to the 18'" to 20'" Defcndanb in their pedigree, There is no

indication whatsoever, whetller the evidence or the 18" delend,Ult was led

on the basis or the pedigree set up by the 11 d, - 14'" Defendants or any other

composite pedigree,

CAREV - 077 1-00 D,C. MATARA P/125 19

1771 In the present case, the learned Additional District Judge has

completely acted in violation of the provisions of the partition law and

merely accepted the evidence of the IS"' Defendant by way of a purported

settlement which lacks in precision, mutuality and compliance with the

provisions of section 91 and 40S of tlle Civil Procedure Code.

17S1 It seems to me that the Court had played tlle role of a blind umpire,

watched helplessly and allowed fundamental \~ce practiced in the partition

proceeding by way of a purported settlement which lacks precision,

consensus and mutuality causing a miscarriage of justice to tlle parties.

Hence, the purported settlement ,md tlle judgment entered upon such

purpOlted settlement cannot be permitted to stand in the eyes of the law.

Investigation of Title of the Parties

1791 Even if it is possible for parties to a pill'tition action to compromise

their disputes, tlle Court has to investigate the title of each party illld

satisfied itself as to the respective rights and allotment of shares upon the

compromise reached by the parties (Gunawilrdella v Ram Menike ,supra).

Section 2!i of the Partition Law imposes on the Court the obligation to

examine cill'efully tlle title of each party to the action. Section 25 of the

Partition Law imposes on the Court tlle obli/rdtion to examine carefully the

title of each pillty to the action. Section 25 (I) of the P,utition Law provides

that: -

(f) On d7e dale fixed lor dIe aiai of a pilrlition acaon or on aJ7Y od7er dale to which the mat may be postponed or ar!/oume{1, d7e COUIt shall eXillmile dJe ade of each parly iJ11d shilll he,ll' iII1d receive evidence in SlljJjJOlt d7ereof;J11d shalf a)' iII1d delem7JiJe alf quesaolls oflaw iJ11d fact anslng li7 d7at acaoJ7 li7 regard to d7e light, share, or li7leresl of each jJiIlty to, 01,' or liJ d7e land lo which d7e action relale.\~ ;l!ld shall cOllsider iIlld deCIde which of d7e orders menaoned liJ secaon 26 should be made.

"

1801 It is settled law that tllere is a paramount duty cast on the Court by Lhe

Partition Law iL~elf to invcstigate the title of thc land sought to bc

partitioned and the parties before thc Coun are those solely cnLitlcd to

such land. The necessity for a full investigaLion and strict proof of Litle has

bcen emphasized in a number ofjudl,'lnents. In G'aJagoda v. Mohideen 40

N.L.R. ~)2, iL was held Lhat the Court should not cnter a (kcrcc in a

partition action unless it is perfcctly satisficd that the persons in whosc

f;tvour it makes the decree are entitled to Lhc propcrty.

1811 In./uliaJ/a HaJ11Jile I ', DOli 7710111as59 N.L.R. 549, it was held that a

parLiLion action cannot be tllC su!Jiect of ,t private arrangement bctween the

patties on matters of title which tlle Court is bound by law to examine. As

noted, Lhere is a Lotal lack of invesLigation of title and no reference is made

to the original ownership of the 1,U1d sought to be partitioned or the

determination of shares of the parties.

1821 The land sought to be partitioned is an illnalgamated land called

"Kattuhena, Sattambigewatrta ,uHI Ambarage Bima" in extent of 8 acres,

whereas the land dcpicted in the Preliminary Plan is in extent of 4 acres :1

roods and 25 perches. No investigation has been made by tJ1C learned

Additional Districl./udge to be satisfied that the amalgamated land sought

to be partitioned is properly depicted in thc Preliminary Plan No. 25 Hi. A

pcrusal of the evidence given by the 18'" Defendant further re\'eals that the

18 Defendants had produced the documcnts marked P I to P6, I V I

tolV4, 4va and 4V4. The record shows, howcver, that the parties had

produced the documents markcd P2 to P7, II V2 and II V 4 and tJ1C Deeds

mill'ked 4Va and 4V 4, I V I and IV 4 had not hcell tendered to Court hy

thc parties. The judgment had becll cntercd on 21.1 0.19!)9 soon after thc

Plain till's P I to P7 werc tended in open Court in tJ1C ahsencc of the

documcnts marked I V I to IV 4, 4 va, 4 V 4, II V3 and II V 4. Thus, the

C.A.REV 0771-00 D.C. MATARA PI12519

documents marked I V I to IV 4, 4 V3, 1 V3 and II V 4 had not been

considered at all by the Court.

1831 For those reasons, I am not inclined to agree with the submission of

Mr. de Silva that the irregularities in the judgment can be rectified by

merely calculating the shares on the evidence of the 18

ili Defendant when

the irregularities of fundamental vice had taken place with reg-ard to the

purpOlted settlement, total lack of investig-ation of title and the lailure to

determine the respective shares of the parties.

Existence of Exceptional Circumstances

1841 The irregularities of fundamental vice with reg-ard to the purported

settlement, the total lack of investil,ration of title of each party, the failure to

consider the respective shares of tlle parties and the absence of a valid

judgement sUPPOlted by reasons are strong exceptional circumstances tllat

warrant the intervention of this Court by way of revision. Hence, tlle

preliminary oqjection Witll regard to the non-existence of exceptional

circumstances is r~jected.

Delay in filing the action after the order dated 23.03.1999 was pronounced

1851 The 8"' and 9" Plaintiffs-Respondents have further raised a preliminalY

objection tllat the Petitioners who were seeking to set aside tlle order dated

23.03. 1999 and all proceedings that had taken place tllereafter had

sullicient time to file tllis application WitlloUt waiting for a period of 1 year

and 4 montlls and hence, the Petitioners are guilty of laches.

1861 The question whether the delay is fatal to an application in revision

depends on tlle facts and circumstances of the case. In this context, it is

appropriate to quote li'om His Lordship former Chief Justice G.P.S. De

Silva, in the case of CIlCUliljJiUJ(iIdJaJI II. Balanayagw17 (1998) I Sli LR 391,

where he held:

1871 The PeLitioners have sought to set aside all proceedings that had taken

place alter the Plaintiff had moved to withdraw the action, which also

include the proceedings and the judgment dated I :~.0:~.2000 . As noted, tlle

proceedings dated 2 1. m. 199~) are tainted with illegality and the judh'lnent

dated 13.0il.2000 is unsupported by reasons and lack of invesLigaLion of

Litle and non-consideration of shares.

1881 Article lil8 of the Constitution has conferred revisionalY jurisdicLion

on tile Court of Appeal to make necessalY orders as may be necessary lilr

the ends of justice where a miscarriage of jus rice has occurred. It is settled

law that if tlle impugned order or part thereof is manilestly erroneous and

is likely to cause grave iqjustice, the Court should not reject the application

on the ground of delay alone (CaroiJilc /Vona and Odlers 1'. Fedn'ck

.SJilg/w and Otilers (2005) il Sri LR 17(i). In Hiw Memke v. Cyn! de A IIV/~

1982 I Sri LR a68, Sharvananda,.l. (as he then was) at a79 observed:

"When tile COWl has ex;umiled dIe rcconl aIld iI' saU:lIied dIe order complaIiled of i5 m;un/esdy el7Y)J}eous or wll/JOul juri5dicu()J} dIe

1891 Once the proceedings dated 21.10.1999 and the judgment dated

I il.03.2000 are manifestly erroneous and liable to be set aside and this

C.A.REY - 0771-00 D,C, MATARA PI12519

application had been made 4 months from the date of the judl,'lTlent dated

13.03.2000, I ,un not inclined to reject the revision application for the

mere delay when such fundamental vice had resulted in a grave miscalTiage

of justice to the palties.

Suppression and Misrepresentation of Material Facts

1901 The 8"' and 9"' Plaintiffs-Respondents have raised a prelimin,u),

o l~jection that there had been a suppression and misrepresentation of

material racts by the Petitioners when they filed this application without

filing a copy of the judgment which was already filed of record by the time

this application was filed. As noted, the Petitioners cannot be found guilty

of willful suppression or misrepresentation of material facts when no

judgment was available in the record ror a period of over 4 months as

borne out by the record.

1911 As noted, in paragraphs 18-23, the Petitioners have made a full and

lair disclosure of all material facts and the circumstances under which they

could not file a certified copy of the judgment with the Petition, which was

clearly not available till 14.07.2000 as borne out by the record.

1921 Even if a copy of the jud!,'lTlent is liled with the Petition, it will not have

any eflect on the outcome of this case as d1e judgment dated 13.03.2000 is

a judl,'lnent unsupported by reasons, lacks investigation of tide of d1e

parties and the determination of the respective shares of the parties. For

those reasons, I reject the preliminal), objection d1at d1e Petitioners have

suppressed and misrepresentation of material facts.

1931 For d10se reasons, I reject all the preliminary objections raised by d1e

8"' and d1e 9- Plaintills-Respondents and hold d1at the revisioIlaI)' powers

of the COUlt of Appeal are \\~de enough to embrace a case of this nature to

remedy a misc,uTiage of justice.

Conclusion

1941 I hold that the order of the learned Additional District Judge dated

23.03.1999 permitting the original 8'" Dclendant to prosecute the partition

action and suhstituting the 8"' Dclendant as a Plaintiff is justified while his

decision to permit tJle original 9"' Dclendant to prosecute the partition

action has no legal basis.

1951 In the interests of justice, I set aside tile proceedings, including the

purported settlement of the District Court of Malara dated 21.10.1999 and

the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge dated I :103.2000. I

direct the learned District Judge of Matara to proceed to trial de 110m

disregarding tile proceedings and the purported settlement dated

21.1 0.f999 and conclude the case as expeditiously as possible.

1961 Sul~iect to tilis variation, the application in revision in part, is allowed.

The parties shall hear their own costs.
