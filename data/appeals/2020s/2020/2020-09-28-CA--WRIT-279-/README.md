Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The father of the Petitioner and 4th Respondent was issued the

permit P1 in respect of an extent of paddy land and high land

under the Land Development Ordinance. The permit holder

nominated the Petitioner as his successor, which is reflected

both in the permit and the land ledger P2. Thereafter, the

permit holder was issued two grants, one for the paddy land and

the other for the high land, both of which are marked P3. The

subject matter in the present case is the paddy land whereas the

subject matter in the connected case No. CA/WRIT/280/2018 is

the high land.

There is no nomination as to succession made in the grant by

the grantee. The grantee died in 1992. The spouse of the

grantee, who succeeded to the land under section 48B of the

Land Development Ordinance, died in 2016.

The requests made by the Petitioner to be recognised as the

owner of the land on the strength of the nomination in the

permit were turned down by the 1st-3rd Respondents. The said

Respondents were instead inclined to recognise the 4th

Respondent, the eldest surviving male child of the grantee, as

the rightful owner of the land, relying on rule 1 of the third

schedule read with section 72 of the Land Development

Ordinance.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to compel the 1st-3rd

Respondents by a writ of mandamus to recognise the Petitioner

as the lawful owner of the paddy land described in the schedule

to the grant, and to prohibit the said Respondents by a writ of

prohibition from issuing a grant in the name of the 4th

Respondent.

4

The pivotal argument of learned State Counsel for the 1st-3rd

Respondents and learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th

Respondent is that a grant has an existence independent of a

permit thereby creating a fresh contract, and therefore a

nominee successor in a permit cannot rely on the nomination in

the permit to claim succession to the land once a grant is issued

in respect of the same land. Learned State Counsel says, unlike

in a permit, in terms of section 37 of the Land Development

Ordinance, The conditions included in any grant shall, as from

the date of such grant, run with the land and shall bind the

original and all owners thereof and all persons whomsoever who

acquire any title thereto. Learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th

Respondent says such grants are issued in terms of the

Presidents prerogative enshrined in Article 33(d) of the

Constitution.

Whether a successor nominated in a permit can rely on such a

nomination in the absence of a nomination in the grant is not a

new issue. This issue has been the subject matter of several

cases before our superior Courts.

In the Court of Appeal case of Piyasena v. Wijesinghe [2002] 2 Sri

LR 242, Justice J.A.N. de Silva as the President of the Court of

Appeal (later C.J.), and in the Supreme Court case of Agosinno v.

Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa (S.C. Appeal No.30/2004)

decided on 23.03.2005, Chief Justice S.N. Silva, answered this

issue in the affirmative.

Referring to the aforesaid Court of Appeal Judgment, R.K.

Goonesekere in his book Select Laws on State Lands says at

page 319 Where a permit-holder becomes a grantee the

nomination of a successor under the permit becomes converted to

a nomination made by her as owner.

5

The Supreme Court, in the said case, held that section 37 of the

Land Development Ordinance cannot apply in relation to a

nomination that has been made by the holder indicating his wish

as to the persons who should succeed him in respect of his

interest.

The Supreme Court also emphasised It is clear from the

provisions of the law that the change in the nature of the holding

from that of a permit to a grant is one process and it should not be

taken as two distinct processes for the purpose of annulling a

nomination that has been previously made.

I am unable to accept the submission of learned Presidents

Counsel for the 4th Respondent that grants are independent of

permits, especially in view of the fact that grants are issued

exclusively by the President under Article 33(d) of the

Constitution.

Section 19 subsections (1) and (2) of the Land Development

Ordinance, insofar as relevant to this context, read as follows:

19(1) Alienation of State land to any person under the

provisions of this Ordinance shall be effected in the manner

hereinafter provided.

(2) Every such person shall in the first instance receive a

permit authorizing him to occupy the land.

The grant P3 has been issued, as stated on the face of it, under

section 19(4) incorporating the stipulations in section 19(6) of

the Land Development Ordinance (Chapter 464), as amended by

Act Nos. 16 of 1969 and 27 of 1981.

6

Section 19(4) reads as follows:

A permit-holder shall be issued a grant in respect of the land of

which he is in occupation

(a) where he has paid all sums which he is required to pay

under subsection (2);

(b) where he has complied with all the other conditions

specified in the Schedule to the permit; and

(c) where he has been in occupation of, and fully developed,

to the satisfaction of the Government Agent

i. irrigated land, for a period of three years, or

ii. high land, for a period of one year:

Provided, however, that the Land Commissioner may

issue a grant before the expiry of the aforesaid period

where the permit-holder satisfies him that the failure to

issue such grant before the expiry of such period would

adversely affect the development of such land.

Section 19(6) reads as follows:

Every grant issued under subsection (4) shall contain the

conditions that the owner of the holding shall not

(a) dispose of a divided portion, or an undivided share of

the holding which is less in extent than the unit of the

sub-division or the minimum fraction specified in the

grant; and

(b) dispose of such holding except with the prior approval of

the Government Agent.

7

The above two sections clearly establish that a grant has no

independent genesis without a permit. The permit is the

precursor to the grant; the two are intrinsically linked. It is the

permit which matures into a grant upon the fulfilment of certain

conditions. In the words of Chief Justice S.N. Silva, as stated in

the above cited Supreme Court case, the permit holders right

fructifies to a grant upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.

This is also made clear by section 48A(2) of the Land

Development Ordinance, which enacts If, during the lifetime of

the spouse of a deceased permit-holder who has succeeded under

subsection (1) to the land alienated on the permit, the terms and

conditions of the permit are complied with by such spouse, such

spouse shall be entitled to a grant of that land, subject to the

conditions stipulated in that section.

The argument that a grant has an existence independent of a

permit is unacceptable.

It may also be relevant to note that the definition of the word

owner found in section 2 of the Land Development Ordinance

was amended by Land Development (Amendment) Act No.27 of

1981 to read as follows:

owner means the owner of a holding whose title thereto is

derived from or under a grant issued under this Ordinance

and includes a permit-holder who has paid all sums which

he is required to pay under subsection (2) of section 19 and

has complied with all the other conditions specified in the

permit.

8

Hence, if the owner of a holding has not nominated a successor

in the grant, the successor nominated in the permit preceding

the grant is entitled to succeed to the land. Such an

interpretation is in consonance with the scheme and purpose of

the Land Development Ordinance.

The word holding, according to section 2, means land alienated

by grant under the Land Development Ordinance.

Rule 1 of the third schedule read with section 72 of the Land

Development Ordinance has no application in such situations.

In general, rule 1 of the third schedule read with section 72

becomes applicable only if no successor has been nominated or

the nominated successor fails to succeed. Let me quote section

72 for better understanding:

If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated

successor fails to succeed, or if the nomination of a

successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the

title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder

who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual

instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the

holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-

holder or owner without leaving behind his or her spouse,

or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind

his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to

succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of such

spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third

Schedule.

9

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th Respondent also makes

the following submissions, if I may say so, in passing.

One submission is that there is suppression of material facts by

the Petitioner. However, the 4th Respondent has not convinced

the Court that the alleged suppression is on material facts.

Another submission is the Petitioner failed to succeed to the

land as required by section 68(2) of the Land Development

Ordinance. The Petitioner has proved his succession to the land

by producing P6-P10. In any event, the 4th Respondent cannot

for the first time take up such a position in this Court. He ought

to have complained about the Petitioners failure to succeed to

the land to the 1st-3rd Respondents at the relevant time and then

come before this Court if he was dissatisfied with the decision.

Yet another submission is the endorsement of the Petitioner as

the nominated successor in the permit and the land ledger is a

forgery. The 4th Respondent has not complained of such a

serious matter to any authority prior to taking it up for the first

time in this Court. The 1st-3rd Respondents stand by the

nomination in the permit.

I am not inclined to accept the arguments advanced on behalf of

the Respondents in resisting the application of the Petitioner.

I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b)-

(d) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.

As agreed, this Judgment is applicable to CA/WRIT/280/2018,

filed in respect of the high land.
