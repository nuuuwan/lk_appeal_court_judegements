Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Permit marked A1 dated 28.02.1992 was issued under the

Land Development Ordinance, No.19 of 1935, as amended, to A.

M. Heen Banda, in respect of a portion of land comprising high

land and paddy land. Heen Banda was married to D. M. Sudu

Bandi, and they had eight children. The Petitioner and the 5th-

8th Respondents are the sons born of that union. As seen from

page 2 of the said Permit, Heen Banda nominated the Petitioner

as his successor to the land on the same day the Permit was

issued.

Heen Banda died on 15.01.1995 and, in terms of section 48A(1)

of the Land Development Ordinance, his spouse, Sudu Bandi,

succeeded to the land and the Grants marked A4 and A5 were

issued in her favour.

In terms of section 48A(2), Sudu Bandi could not alienate or

nominate a successor to the land and could only possess it

during her lifetime. Therefore, in terms of section 48A(3), Sudu

Bandis nomination of the Petitioner as her successor to the

land, by A6 and A7, is invalid. Learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner concedes this position.

Sudu Bandi died on 04.04.2004; thereafter, the Petitioner, as

the nominated successor of the Permit holder, Heen Banda,

succeeded to the land by operation of the law vide section 49

of the Land Development Ordinance.

Disputes had arisen among the siblings regarding possession of

the land. It appears the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary of

Ampara tried to settle the disputes but to no avail. Thereafter

5

the 1st Respondent directed the Petitioner and the 7th and 8th

Respondents by a letter marked A13 to resolve their dispute in

Court. In the said letter, the 1st Respondent further informs he

will not be performing any duties in respect of this land dispute

thenceforth, due to the unruly behaviour of the parties at the

inquiries held in this regard.

It is thereafter that the 5th Respondent, as the eldest son of Heen

Banda, filed two actions in the District Court of Ampara to have

himself declared the rightful owner of the land under the Land

Development Ordinance.

I must mention at this stage that in terms of section 72 read

with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule to the Land Development

Ordinance, the eldest son will succeed to the land pursuant to

the Third Schedule coming into effect if no successor has been

nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to succeed, or if the

nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of [the]

Ordinance. In the instant matter, there is a nominated

successor to the land and therefore the claim of the 5th

Respondent is unsustainable.

The 5th-8th Respondents have tendered R5(a) and (b) to submit

that after having nominated the Petitioner as his successor,

Heen Banda later changed his mind and desired the land to be

given to his three youngest sons: the Petitioner, the 7th and 8th

Respondents. The Land Development Ordinance lays down a

procedure for the cancellation and replacement of a nominated

successor. Even assuming R5(a) and (b) are authentic, these

cannot be considered a valid nomination.

6

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash by a

writ of certiorari the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in

A13 referred to above, and to compel the 1st and 2nd

Respondents by a writ of mandamus to take steps to issue a

Permit or Grant in respect of the land to the Petitioner in terms

of the Land Development Ordinance.

I have no qualms that the writ of certiorari sought can be

issued, as the 1st Respondent cannot refuse to perform his

statutory duty on the ground of unruly behaviour by the parties

at the inquiry. The 1st Respondent could have obtained the

assistance of a police officer during the course of the inquiry, if

he so desired. Nor can the 1st Respondent direct the parties to

go to the District Court for a decision on the question of

succession. Once the 1st Respondent determines the successor

to the land in terms of the Land Development Ordinance, the

dissatisfied party, if so advised, can come before this Court

challenging the said decision by way of a writ application.

Regarding issuance of mandamus, learned Counsel for the 5th-

8th Respondents takes up the position that the nomination of the

Petitioner in the Permit marked A1 by the Permit holder Heen

Banda is invalid because Heen Banda has not placed his

signature in the required place on the Permit. The Permit holder

never took up such a position during his lifetime. The 1st and

the 2nd Respondents also do not take up the position the

nomination is invalid on this basis. In fact, the 5th-8th

Respondents themselves did not take up this position in any of

the inquiries before the 1st Respondent, and moreover, took it

up before this Court for the first time at the stage of the

argument vide the limited statement of objections filed in this

7

regard dated 15.06.2017. As seen from the documents tendered

by the Petitioner, such as A12, it is clear the 1st and 2nd

Respondents have acted on the validity of the said nomination.

The Land Development Ordinance does not state the nomination

of a successor to the land will not be valid unless the Permit

holder signs the Permit. The Permit relevant to this matter,

which contains 17 conditions, has been signed and dated by the

Divisional Secretary. It is furthermore stated on the Permit that

the contents thereof have been explained to the Permit holder,

and the Permit holder has nominated A.M. Punchi Banda (son) as

the successor. The Divisional Secretary has again placed his

signature below the aforementioned statement. This, in my

view, is sufficient compliance.

Learned Counsel for the 5th-8th Respondents submits the

Petitioner has not acted with uberrima fides and, therefore, the

Petitioners application shall be dismissed in limine.

Making a comparison between A4 and R2 i.e. the certified

copies of the Grants previously referred to, tendered by the

Petitioner and the 5th-8th Respondents respectively the said

Respondents state A4 does not contain conditions 8-10 which

are included in R2, and this is an act of manipulation on the

part of the Petitioner because the said conditions are

disadvantageous to the Petitioner. There is no evidence to say

this is manipulation by the Petitioner. Both A4 and R2 are

certified copies issued by the 1st Respondent. In any event, the

Petitioner does not rely on the said Grants in this application.

8

The 5th-8th Respondents further say, although the Petitioner

states in the petition that he is in sole possession of the land in

dispute, R3-R5 demonstrate the 7th and 8th Respondents are

also in possession of the land. This, in my view, cannot be

considered a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner

on a material fact warranting dismissal of the Petitioners

application in limine. This is neither a possessory action nor a

Section 66 application. The question is not who is in possession

of the land but rather, who, in terms of the Land Development

Ordinance, is entitled to succeed to the land upon the death of

the Permit holder and his spouse.

Finally, the 5th-8th Respondents state the Petitioner is guilty of

laches having come before this Court nearly 20 years after A4

and A5 were issued. I cannot understand this argument. There

was no necessity for the Petitioner, being the nominated

successor of the original Permit holder Heen Banda, to come

before this Court until the 1st Respondent, by A13, refused to

discharge his statutory duty and declare the Petitioner the

successor to the land. There is no delay on the part of the

Petitioner.

I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b),

(c) and (d) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
