JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the murder

of Hapuarachchige Jayasena on 30.07.2003 which is an offence punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

CA/HCC/0117/24

3 | P a g e

As the Accused had opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led 08 witnesses and marked productions P1

to P5, and X1 and closed the case. The learned High Court Judge being

satisfied that the evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to

be answered, called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

The Appellant had made a dock statement and closed his case.

After considering the evidence presented by both sides, the learned High

Court Judge had found the Appellant guilty under Section 297 of the Penal

Code and sentenced him for 14 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs.30,000/ and with a default sentence of 12 months rigorous

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant had

preferred this appeal.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the

time of argument, the Appellant was connected via zoom from prison.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case, the Appellant and the deceased were employed as security

officers by the management of the Dikkanda Estate situated in the

jurisdiction of the Gampaha High Court. On the date of the incident the

Appellant was on duty and the deceased was off duty and resting at the

house allocated inside the estate. PW1 was the chief security officer under

whom the Appellant and the deceased worked.

On the date of the incident, at around 1 a.m. PW1 had received a phone call

from the Appellant stating that he had stabbed the deceased. The Appellant

had further told PW1 that he had no choice as the deceased was spreading

rumour about him and as a result, he could not face the society. It transpired

CA/HCC/0117/24

4 | P a g e

during the said period that the Appellant was having an extra marital

relationship with a woman.

Thereafter, the Appellant had gone to meet PW2 and requested a three-

wheeler to go to a nearby hotel where his paramour was staying. He had

confessed to PW2 that he had stabbed the deceased. After meeting her, when

he returned to Dikkanda Estate, PW1 had arrived and both had gone to the

police station. At the police station the Appellant was arrested and his

statement was recorded.

The evidence revealed that a dispute had subsisted between the deceased

and the Appellant as the deceased had spread the rumour about the

Appellants illicit affair. This misunderstanding had been the cause of the

incident which culminated in the murder of the deceased.

At the trial PW1, PW2, PW5, PW11, PW14, PW15 and PW17 had given

evidence. PW6 had died before he could give evidence in the High Court.

Hence, his evidence was marked under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance

by the prosecution.

According to the Appellant he had stabbed the deceased when he was struck

by someone from his behind. It is not contradicted that he made confessions

to PW1 and PW2 that he had stabbed the deceased due to sudden anger as

the deceased had spread the rumour about his misdeed.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted to this court that he is only

contesting the sentence, as the given circumstances of the case does not

warrant the imposition of a long custodial sentence.

The evidence led by the prosecution revealed that the Appellant was

constantly provoked by the deceased for some time, which had gone to the

extent of affecting the family life of the Appellant which consisted of his wife

and his 06 school going children. This has continuously provoked the

Appellant and due to shame and stress he had been made unable to face the

society.

CA/HCC/0117/24

5 | P a g e

The learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the Appellant strenuously

argued that this is a fit and proper case to be considered under Section 297

of the Penal Code on the basis of provocation and sudden fight. Although the

learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant under Section 297 of

the Penal Code, the judgment does not reveal that the learned High Court

Judge had considered the exception to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

The exception 1 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst

deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden

provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the

provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or

accident,

The above exception is subject to the following provisos:-

Firstly- That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked

by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any

person.

Secondly- That the provocation is not given by anything done in

obedience to the law or by a public servant, in the lawful exercise

of the powers of such public servant-

Thirdly- That the provocation is not given by anything done in the

lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation

Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent

the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

As stated above, due to the deceased spreading rumours about the

Appellants extramarital affair and that long-standing dispute had

CA/HCC/0117/24

6 | P a g e

cumulatively provoked the Appellant which ended up in the murder of the

deceased.

Considering the evidence presented by both parties, there was ample

evidence available to affirm provocation due to the deceaseds behaviour. But

this had completely escaped the consideration of the learned High Court

Judge.

Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance states;

When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general

exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the

offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances.

In R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General SC Appeal

32/2015, SC minute dated 17.07.2020, the court held that:

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering the plea

of grave and sudden provocation an accused is entitled to rely upon a

series of prior events that ultimately led to the incident at which the death

was caused. A court should not restrict its focus to an isolated incident

that resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden

provocation. The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of

this plea by expanding the limitations recognised in its statutory form.

Thereby, the concept of Continuing or Cumulative provocation has been

recognised under Exception -1, Section 294 of the Penal Code. Therefore,

the proximity of time between the actus reus of the accused and the

provocative act of the victim should be considered in the context of the

CA/HCC/0117/24

7 | P a g e

nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether an accused is

entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation

In Premalal v AG [2000] 2 SLR 403, the court held that:

Each case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances. In the

present case, my view is that, in judging the conduct of the accused, one

must not confine himself to the actual moment when the bow, which

ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to say, one must not take

into consideration only the event which took place immediately before the

fatal blow was struck. We must take into consideration the previous

conduct of the woman. Her evil ways were the common scandal of the

village and must have been known to the husband, causing him extreme

mental agony, shame and humiliation.

The evidence clearly shows that the deceased had provoked the Appellant by

spreading rumours. Being provoked, the Appellant had lost his self-control

and inflicted injuries to the deceased. Therefore, the learned High Court had

very correctly held the Appellant responsible under Section 297 of the Penal

Code.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted to Court that although the

learned High Court Judge had correctly held the Appellant responsible under

Section 297 of the Penal Code, she had failed to consider the mitigatory

factors in favour of the Appellant when she passed the sentence.

The Appellant, had confessed after the incident to the prosecution witnesses

that he had committed the offence due to grave and sudden provocation

without any pre-planning but on the spur of the moment. Further, he had

not absconded after the incident and had directly gone to the police station

CA/HCC/0117/24

8 | P a g e

with PW1 to inform the incident and had further showed the knife which was

used to lacerate the deceased, to the police following his arrest.

Section 8(2) of the evidence Ordinance states:

The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit or

proceeding in reference to such suit or proceeding or in reference to any

fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any person

an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, is relevant, if

such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevant

fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent therein.

In the case of Chandrakant Ganpat Sovitkar Vs. State of Maharastra in

(1975) 3 SCC 16 the court held:

When Court takes into account the conduct of an accused, his conduct

must be looked at in its entirety.

Next the learned Presidents Counsel contended that the conviction against

the Appellant was entered only after 21 years of the incident. As such, he

has been carrying the mental agony of the instant incident on his shoulders

for nearly 21 years. At present the Appellant is 72 years of age and unlikely

to commit any offence if he re-enters the society.

It is trite law, when a long delay has occurred in passing the judgment from

the date of offence, without any lapse on the part of the Appellant, then it

should be considered in favour of the Appellant. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the Appellant submits that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider this when she passed the sentence on the Appellant.

CA/HCC/0117/24

9 | P a g e

In Anura Herath v CIABOC CA-HCC 0089-090/18 dated 05.07.2023 the

court held:

In this matter we observe that the incident had taken place in 2013 and

the trial had concluded in 2018. Therefore, from the date of incident 10

years have lapsed. This Court also notes that if the remorsefulness

expressed by the Accused Appellants at this stage had been expressed

at the time when the trial was taken up, the long process of a trial could

have been avoided and it would have saved the time of the Judge, the

Counsel and all parties. Nevertheless, having considered submissions of

all parties, this Court is of the view that since both the Accused Appellants

are first time offenders and the time duration, since the date of offence and

the conclusion of the trial that the sentences imposed on the Accused

Appellants should be reviewed.

In AG v Devapriya Walgamage and Others [1990] 2 SLR 212 the court held:

A term of imprisonment is not warranted because, thirteen years has

lapsed since the commission of the offence, the accused will lose his

employment and related benefits, a substantial fine has been imposed

which would meet the ends of justice.

While PW1 was giving evidence, on 27.07.2011 the Appellant expressing

remorse wanted to conclude the case early, but the trial dragged on and only

concluded on 05.01.2024. Had the prosecution taken up a progressive

approach after considering the evidence available, it could have saved the

valuable time of the court as well as all the parties.

Finally, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted to this court that when

the sentence was passed, the Appellant was 72 years of age which is two

years less comparing to the World Health Organization Data on life

CA/HCC/0117/24

10 | P a g e

expectancy of a male in Sri Lanka. Although this was brought to the notice

of the court during the mitigation submission, the learned High Court Judge

has not given due attention to it when she passed the 14 years sentence on

the Appellant.

In Illakotulena Gamaralalage Thilakerathna v The Attorney General SC

Appeal No. 173/2017 the Supreme Court held:

Consideration of aggravating or mitigatory circumstances generally, has

relevance to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence. The

appropriate effect on such consideration in sentence would depend on the

circumstances of each case, in which the Court can take note of any factor

it considers to aggravate or mitigate the imposed sentence. As such, the

consideration of proportionality of the sentence to the gravity of the

convicted offence, must be well reasoned.

As held in the case of Alister Anthoney Pereira vs. State of

Maharashta1, Sentencing policy is an important task in the matters of

crime. One of the prime objectives of criminal law is imposition of

appropriate adequate just and proportionate sentence commenced with the

nature and gravity of the crime and the manner in which the crime is done.

There is no straight-jacket formula for 4 [2021] 3 SLR 323 5 78 NLR 413 6

[1995] 1 SLR 138 7 [2012] AIR 3820 (SC) 9 sentencing an accused on proof

of crime. The courts have evolved certain principles: Twin objectives of

sentencing policy is deterrence and correction what sentence would meet

the ends of Justice depends on the fact and circumstances of each case

and the court must keep in mind the gravity of the crime, motive for the

crime, nature of the offense and all other attendant circumstances. The

principle of proportionality in sentencing is a crime duo is well entrenched

in criminal jurisprudence. As a matter of law proportion between crime and

1 [2012] AIR 3820 (SC)

CA/HCC/0117/24

11 | P a g e

punishment bears mostly relevant influence in determination of sentencing

the crime to a full stop the court has to take into consideration all aspects

including social interest and consciousness of the Society for award of

appropriate sentence.

Considering the facts of the case and the submissions made by both counsels

I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to order a long

custodial sentence against the Appellant.

Therefore, I set aside the sentence of 14 years rigorous imprisonment

imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha and

substitute a sentence of four years rigorous imprisonment operative from the

date of sentence which is 05.01.2024. The fine imposed by the High Court

will remain unchanged. Considering all the circumstances of the case, I order

a compensation of Rs.200,000/- payable to the deceaseds family, with a

default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

Subject to above variation, the appeal is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send the judgment to the High Court

of Gampaha along with the original case record.
