JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) along with the 1st and 2nd Accused were indicted jointly in the

High Court of Balapitiya as follows:

CA/HCC/0101/2022

3 | P a g e

1. On or before 02.09.1999 for committing the attempted murder of

Kirimadura Upali Mendis punishable under Section 4(2) of the Offensive

Weapon Act read together with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction committing attempted murder on

Kirimadura Upali Mendis punishable under Section 300 read together

with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Balapitiya as the

Appellant and the 1st and 2nd Accused had opted for a non-jury trial. The 1st

Accused had died during the pendency of the trial. The prosecution had

called 06 witnesses and marked productions P1-P4. After the conclusion of

the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the

defence and the Appellant and the 2nd Accused had given evidence under

oath and closed their case. After considering the evidence presented by both

parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant for the 1st

and 2nd counts and acquitted the 2nd Accused from the case.

The Appellant was sentenced as follows on 09/07/2021:

For the 1st count the Appellant was sentenced to 12 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/- in default of which a sentence

of 03 months simple imprisonment was imposed. Further a

compensation of Rs.150,000/- was ordered to be paid to the wife of

the 1st Witness with a default sentence of 9 months simple

imprisonment.

For the 2nd count the Appellant was sentenced to 02 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/- in default of which a sentence

of 03 months simple imprisonment was imposed. Further a

compensation of Rs.150,000/- was ordered to be paid to the wife of

the 1st Witness with a default sentence of 9 months simple

imprisonment.

CA/HCC/0101/2022

The Court further ordered for the sentences imposed for the 1st and

2nd counts to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in their absence. At the time of

argument, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, Upali Mendis was working as a security officer at the Municipal Council

of Galle at the time of the incident. On the day of the incident although he

was on leave, he had gone to Galle to attend to some personal matters. When

he was returning home, he was ambushed by the Accused and attacked with

a hand grenade and the accused had fired shots at him. He had sustained

injuries and had been hospitalized subsequently.

PW1 had gone missing before he could conclude his evidence. After much

deliberation and applications, the learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya

allowed the prosecution to mark his non summary deposition under Section

33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

According to PW04, the JMO who examined PW1, stated that injuries No. 01,

02, 03 and 04 are non-grievous and not sufficient to cause death in the

ordinary cause of nature. In the history to the doctor, the 1st Witness had

stated that an unidentified person had thrown an object at him which

exploded and inflicted injuries to him.

The Appellant had raised five grounds of appeal which are set out below:

1. The learned Trial Judge had failed to apply her judicial mind in arriving

at a finding whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond a

reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/0101/2022

5 | P a g e

2. The learned Trial Judge had misdirected herself by failing to judicially

evaluate the inter se and per se contradictions and omissions which

casts a reasonable doubt on the prosecutions case with regard to the

credibility of the witnesses and thereby the conviction is bad in law.

3. The learned Trial Judge had failed legally to consider and evaluate the

evidence of PW1 elicited at the non-summary trial adopted in terms of

Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. Further, the learned Trial Judge

had also failed to legally consider and evaluate the incomplete

testimony of PW1 placed on record and had thereby erred in fact and

in law.

4. The conviction is contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence

thereby the learned Trial Judge had erroneously determined the

culpability of each accused.

5. The learned Trial Judge had failed to properly and legally consider the

totality of evidence and thereby deprived a fair trial to the Appellant.

As the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

In this case a serious misdirection by the learned High Court Judge had

caused great prejudice to the Appellant. Before the prosecution could

conclude the evidence of PW1, he had gone missing without a trace. After a

lengthy inquiry the learned High Court Judge had allowed the prosecution

to mark the non-summary deposition of PW1 and to continue the case.

Although the learned High Court Judge, in her judgment had mentioned that

the evidence given by PW1 is incomplete, she had acted on that incomplete

deposition to convict the Appellant and pass the sentence. The learned

Counsel for the Appellant, highlighting this procedural discrepancy

strenuously argued that the judgment of the learned High Court Judge is not

CA/HCC/0101/2022

tenable in view of this irregularity. The relevant portion of the judgement is

re-produced below:

The learned Additional Solicitor General in keeping with the highest tradition

of the Attorney Generals Department, conceded the argument put forward

by the Counsel for the Appellant. He was also of the view that the learned

High Court Judge has wrongfully adopted the evidence given by PW1 at the

non-summary inquiry under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Hence, I conclude that the evidence given by PW1 at the non-summary

inquiry is incomplete and cannot be considered to make a case against the

Appellant. Other evidence provided by the witnesses called by the

prosecution had also failed to establish the charges levelled against the

Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. It is noteworthy that PW1, had failed

to mentioned the names of the assailants in his history given to the doctor.

Considering all of the above, I hereby set aside the conviction and sentence

imposed on the Appellant and he is therefore acquitted from this case.

The appeal is allowed.
