JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J,

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Kaluthara in HC Case No. 552/2005.

2. The charge in the indictment is as follows;

That on or about 21.04.2003, within the jurisdiction of this

Court, you did commit murder by causing the death of one

Kasthuri Archchige Deepani Managalika, and that you have

3

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 296

of the Penal Code.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant has been convicted and

sentenced to death.

Case of the prosecution

4. The appellant and the deceased along with a child conceived by the

deceased through a third individual have been living in a room in the

house of PW02. PW01 has been living in a house situated close to that

of PW02 but at a lower elevation. At around 11.30 pm on 21.04.2003,

the night before the incident, the deceased and the child have visited

PW01 and requested permission to spend the night there to which

PW01 has consented to. Between 02.00 am and 3.00 am the next

morning, the appellant had arrived at PW01s house inquiring about

the deceased. When the deceased confronted the appellant, the latter

has assaulted her and subsequently held the deceased by her head.

Together with the child and the deceased, the appellant has proceeded

towards the house of PW02. Upon entering PW02s house, PW02 has

4

inquired about the deceased. The appellant has replied that she was

near the door. Although PW02 has had called out for the deceased, she

has not come into the house. At that moment, the appellant has realised

that the deceased was not present. Thereafter, the appellant has fed the

child and gone to the police station to lodge a complaint against the

deceased. After returning, he has attempted to locate the deceased.

PW02 and PW04 have assisted the appellant in that regard. At

approximately, 12.00 noon on the same date, PW04 has discovered the

body of the deceased in a thicket and informed the appellant of the

incident. Subsequently, the appellant has lodged a complaint with the

Police. Investigations had been conducted into the death of the

deceased and a post-mortem examination performed on 23.04.2003

beginning 11.30 am by Dr. K. Sunil Kumara Consultant Judicial Medical

Officer at the General Hospital in Kaluthara. The post-mortem report

has been marked X at the trial.

Case of the accused

5. The appellant has maintained that he has no connection to the alleged

circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased.

5

6. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant has urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. The conclusion reached by the Learned High Court that

the items of circumstantial evidence placed before Court

are sufficient to arrive at the one and only irresistible

and inescapable inference that the appellant committed

the murder is wrong in law.

ii. The Learned High Court Judge had rejected the evidence

of the defence on unreasonable grounds.

7. Dr. K. Sunil Kumara has observed seven injuries on the body of the

deceased. He has described those injuries to be contusions, lacerations

and abrasions.

8. Further, expressing his opinion as regards to the cause of death of the

deceased. he has stated as follows;

Due to intracerebral haemorrhage the injuries are

consistent with having being caused by a blunt weapon.

6

9. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has argued that the

prosecutions case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, suggesting

that the inferences drawn could support the appellants innocence.

10. The Learned Deputy Solicitor General has challenged the argument

made by the Learned Counsel for the appellant. The Court has been

alerted to the time frame when the appellant had a chance to commit

the offence, particularly when he came back to the house of PW02 with

the deceased. Further, the attention of this Court was also drawn to the

alleged utterance made by the appellant at about 06.00 am or 06.30

am in the morning of the incident, that a third individual was

responsible for the deceaseds death, claiming to mislead the rest.

[vide page 90 of the Brief]

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General has also pointed out that the

appellant was the last person seen with the deceased before her body

was discovered and the time gap minimal, enhancing the argument

consolidated in the principle, the last seen theory against the

7

appellant. Further, suggested that the likelihood of the appellants

involvement in the offence is significant, outweighing the possibility of

a third individuals involvement.

11. Circumstantial evidence refers to evidence that indirectly indicate a

fact or event, rather that providing direct proof. Circumstantial evidence

relies on inference. The strength of circumstantial evidence often

depends on the context and the overall situation surrounding the

evidence. Multiple pieces of circumstantial evidence can create a strong

case together. Logical inferences must be drawn on the circumstantial

evidence available. Those inferences need to be reasonable and based

on a fair interpretation of such evidence.

When circumstantial evidence consistently points to the same

conclusion, its more reasonable to draw inferences. Multiple pieces of

evidence supporting one narrative strengthens the argument. Further,

conclusions must be based on the evidence and not on assumptions or

emotional responses.

8

12. In Bandara Deegahawathura vs. Attorney General CA No.

61/2001 decided on 02.08.2005, Justice Sisira de Abrew discussing

the nature of the inferences that must be drawn from circumstantial

evidence and how such inferences could be drawn, has stated as

follows;

The case against the appellant depended entirely on

circumstantial evidence. Therefore it is necessary to consider the

principles governing the cases of circumstantial evidence.

In the case of King Vs Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 Soertsz

J remarked as follows. In order to base a conviction on

circumstantial evidence the jury must be satisfied that the

evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonably hypothesis of his innocence.

In King Vs Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 Keuneman J held that

in order to justify the inference of guilty from purely

circumstantial evidence, the inculpatory facts must be

incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of

explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of

his guilt.

9

In Podisingho Vs. King 53 NLR 49 Dias J held that in a

case of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial Judge to

tell the jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent with

the innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his

guilt.

In Emperor Vs Browning (1917) 18 Cr. L.J.482 court held

the jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the

possibility that the act was done by some other person, and if they

have doubts, the prisoner must have the benefits of those doubts.

Having regard to the principles laid down in the above

judicial decisions I hold that in a case of circumstantial evidence

in order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury

or the trial judge as the case may be must be satisfied on following

grounds. (a) Proved facts must be consistent only with the guilt of

the accused (b) Proved facts must point the finger of guilt only to

the accused (c) Proved facts must be incompatible and

inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. (d) Proved facts

must be incapable of any other reasonable explanation than that

of his guilt. In a case of circumstantial evidence, if two decisions

are possible from the proved facts, then the decision which is

10

favorable to the accused must be taken. In a case of circumstantial

evidence, if the circumstances found to be as consistent with the

innocence as with the guilt of the accused; or if an innocent

explanation is found from the evidence of the prosecution, no

inference of guilt should be drawn. Therefore if the prosecution

seeks to prove a case purely on circumstantial evidence, the

prosecution must exclude the possibility that the proved facts are

consistent with the innocence of the accused.

13. Although PW01 has stated that she heard the appellant make an

utterance suggesting that a third person had killed the deceased, PW02

who was with the appellant at that time had not heard such an

utterance. After leaving PW02s house to fetch the deceased in the early

hours of the morning, the appellant has returned shortly thereafter.

Upon entering the house, carrying the child, he has been asked where

the deceased was, to which he has replied that she was at the door. The

appellant has realised that the deceased had not followed him when

PW02 had called out to her in vain. After feeding the child, the appellant

has gone to the Police Station to report the deceased, PW02 had

corroborated this testimony.

11

14. After returning from the Police Station the appellant has begun

searching for the deceased, first with PW02 and later with PW04.

Around noon, PW04 has discovered the body of the deceased. Upon

hearing about this discovery, the appellant has been saddened about

the incident. He has thereafter, promptly gone to the Police Station to

file a complaint.

15. The narrative of the prosecution being as stated above, the

circumstantial evidence presented by it against the appellant is not

cogent. The circumstantial evidence appears weak, relying on

speculative inferences rather than solid facts. Key elements of the

prosecutions argument lack consistency and the alternative

explanations for the evidence diminish its reliability. The prosecution

has failed to establish a clear and unbroken chain of events leading to

the appellants involvement, eroding the case against him. Importantly,

there is a conspicuous absence of motive, which weakens the

significance of the circumstantial evidence. Additionally, any inferences

drawn seem to lack reasonableness, often leading towards conjecture.

Considering the legal standard that guilt must be established beyond a

12

reasonable doubt, the evidence presented by the prosecution falls short,

especially when weighted against the appellants counter arguments.

Thus the evidence adduced by the prosecution, in the opinion of this

Court fails to implicate the appellant to the offence.

16. Further, in order to apply the principle of last seen theory the

prosecution bears the responsibility of proving that the appellants

actions co-related with the timing of the deceaseds death. If the

evidence regarding the death is ambiguous or inconclusive, it creates a

reasonable doubt in the appellants involvement. In this context, as the

prosecution has failed to establish the time of death, the Learned High

Court Judge has misapplied such principle to infer the culpability of

the appellant. Hence, misdirected himself in that regard.

17. In The King vs. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128, Keuneman, J, stated as

follows;

The following points in favour of the accused may be

emphasised;

(1) The absence of any motive whatever for the accused to

murder the deceased...

13

(5) The prosecution failed to fix the exact time of the death of the

deceased, and the fact that the deceased was last seen in the

company of the accused loses a considerable part of its

significance. The presence of rice and curry in the stomach of

the deceased also indicates a strong possibility that the death

took place some hours after the deceased set out with the

accused.

18. This offence has been committed in the year 2003. 22 years have

passed since the commission of the offence. Therefore, this Court finds

that it does not seem just to call upon the appellant to defend himself

again after such an unconscionable lapse of time.

In Queen vs. G. K. Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314 at page 328, Sansoni, J, has

stated,

we have considered whether we should order a new trial in this

case. We do not take that course, because there has been a lapse

of three years since the commission of the offences, and because

of our own view of the unreliable nature of the accomplices

evidence on which alone the prosecution case rests.

14

We accordingly direct that the judgment of acquittal be

entered.

19. Hence, this is not a fit case to order a re-trial.

20. Due to the factors set out above, I am inclined to interfere with the

disputed judgment and hereby set aside the conviction together with

the disputed sentencing order. Accordingly, acquit the appellant from

the charge in the indictment,

Appeal allowed.

21. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Kaluthara for compliance.

B. SASI MAHENDRAN, J.
