Mainly, the Petitioners challenge and seek to reverse the orders dated 24th February 2023 and 7th February 2024, claiming the Magistrate erred in reopening the case based on an invalid affidavit and the misapplication of Section 39 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978. 2] They also request the reinstatement of the discharge order dated 22nd February 2022, as the complainant failed to provide sufficient grounds under Section 188(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to reopen the case. Additionally, the Petitioners urge the Court to take action against the Inspector of Police Liyanadura Saman Sri Pathmalal Silva for misleading the court with a false affidavit intended to conceal his negligence. 3] The learned senior counsel at the argument stressed that the 1st to 4th Accused-Petitioner-Petitioners were correctly discharged by the Learned Magistrate of Horana on 22nd February 2022 under Section 188(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure due to continuous failure of the prosecution, including the 1st Complainant-Respondent-Respondent, to appear for trial despite repeated summons. However, the same Magistrate erroneously reinstated the case through two orders, dated 24th February 2023 and 7th February 2024, based on two affidavits submitted by the 1st Complainant-Respondent. One of the affidavits lacked a valid jurat, and the other contained false averments that contradicted the official journal entries dated 8th June 2022 and 22nd February 2023. He contended that the Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact by accepting these affidavits without verifying their admissibility or truthfulness and by ignoring the mandatory legal requirement under Section 182(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 4] The Petitioners state that the Revision Application (HCR/19/2024) filed before the High Court of Panadura was dismissed merely on technical grounds, i.e., alleged delay, without notice to Respondents or due consideration of exceptional circumstances such as floods and financial constraints that hindered timely appeal filing. Thus, the Petitioners seek to set aside the three impugned orders and request relief by way of restitutio in integrum. 5] The Accused Petitioner-Petitioners submit that, under the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance No. 9 of 1895, an affidavit is considered sworn evidence, and submitting a false affidavit amounts to contempt of court, punishable under Sections 11 and 12 of the Ordinance. 6] The Petitioners challenge three impugned orders: two by the Magistrate of Horana dated 24th February 2023 and 7th February 2024, and one by the High Court Judge of Panadura dated 15th October 2024, which dismissed their",

It is seen that the Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of the court by Panadura High Court Case bearing No. HCR/19/2024. They say that the delay of filing the said revision was due to financial hardship, floods, other justifiable impediments and the dismissal was on technical grounds, which cannot be sustained. On that footing, the Petitioners requested this court to quash the reopening or reinstatement of Case No. 15014/16 before the Magistrates Court of Horana. Thus, being an Appellate Court, this Court cannot superficially verify the facts or embark on a voyage of discovery. It is my considered view that when the facts are disputed by the parties, there can be no relief of restitution. 8] It is seen that the following reinstatement orders, based on affidavits by the 1st Complainant-Respondent-Respondent and the Petitioners, argue that these were either procedurally invalid or based on factually false statements. It should be noted that, being satisfied with the facts, the learned Magistrate had reinstated the case under section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 9] I now consider the ambit of section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code as amended.

[Emphasis is added] 10] On careful perusal of the journal entries of the case, charges were read over to the accused on 26/09/2016. Thereafter, summons was issued on the 1st and 2nd prosecution witnesses. PW1 was present on 20/11/2017, which is the second trial date. Thereafter, PW1 & PW2 were present on 14/05/2018, the third trial date; however, the trial was not taken up. PW 1 and 2 were warranted on 29/08/2018. However, 1st accused pleaded guilty to the charges and later, since there was one previous conviction, he withdrew the plea (Vide journals 27/03/2019). On that day, PW1 was present and he had mentioned that he appeared in Kalutara Courts. In between, the Telephone Tower and CCTV footage were called on the application of the Accused. Thereafter, the case was caught up in COVID-19 circumstances. On 22/02/2023, since PW1 was summoned and failed to appear in court, the learned Magistrate had discharged all the accused. After the discharge order was issued within 2 days, the prosecution filed a motion along with the affidavit, and PW1 was also present; the reinstatement order was made. There was no appeal or revision was filed against the reinstatement order by the Petitioners. 11] It is seen that thereafter, the trial was fixed on 31/10/2022 and by motion dated 24/10/2023, the reinstatement was resisted before a week of the trial. The application was challenged mainly on the validity of the Affidavit. The learned Magistrate has observed the following with related to said affidavit;",

Hence, there is no rule that an application must be supported by an affidavit; if the application is supported by an affidavit, it would be much stronger than a bare application. However, it is seen that the said errors were corrected by another affidavit; thus, there is no merit in this contention. 13] In Kobbekaduwa vs. Jayewardene and others [1983 1 SLR 419], the Supreme Court held the function of an affidavit as;",

We see that PW1 has come previously, and therefore, there was no apparent intentional default in this matter. 16] Be that as it may, to invoke the jurisdiction of Restitutio in integrum, there should be an exceptional and extraordinary situation.
