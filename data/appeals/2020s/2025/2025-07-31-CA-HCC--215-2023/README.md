JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Chillaw under Sections 54(A)(b) and 54(A)(d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for the

trafficking and being in possession (respectively) of 16.52 grams of Heroin on

16th August 2013.

After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Chilaw has imposed life imprisonment on him for both

counts on 13th of September, 2023.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellant informed this Court that the Appellant has

given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. Hence, argument was

taken up in his absence but he was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

The Appellant had raised the following grounds of appeal.

1. The prosecution has failed to prove the chain of inward journey beyond

reasonable doubt, as there is a discrepancy in the total weight of the

powder contained in the production sent by the Police Narcotics

CA-HCC 0215/2023

3 | P a g e

Bureau which was weighed by PW1 and the weight indicated by the

Government Analysts Department.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the material inter

se contradictions of the main prosecution witnesses who had

conducted the inquiry.

PW1, IP/Antony attached to the Special Task Force Camp, Kelaniya had

arrested the Appellant on 16.08.2013 at Thoppuwa Junction, Kochchikade.

Upon receiving an information from his personal informant at 2.00 p.m.,

PW1 along with some other officers had gone to Thoppuwa Junction and

stationed their vehicle facing the direction of Negombo from the Thoppuwa

Junction. While on observation, PW1 had received a phone call from the

informant about the movement of the Appellant. Acting on that information,

PW1 and PW2 Kekulandara had walked up to a bus stop situated along

Dankotuwa Road and identified the Appellant with the description given by

the informant. Having introduced themselves to the Appellant, PW2 had

checked the Appellant and uncovered a cellophane bag with 09 packets from

his trouser pocket with some substance suspected to be Heroin. Thereafter,

the Appellant was brought to the Police Narcotics Bureau and the substance

was weighed using an electronic scale. The gross quantity of the substance

had weighed about 48 grams. All productions had been properly sealed,

finger print of the Appellant was obtained, and entered in the Production

Register and was then handed over to the reserve police officer.

PW2 SI/Kekulandara was called by the prosecution to corroborate the

evidence of PW1.

In his dock statement, the Appellant took up the position that he was never

in possession of any dangerous drugs as claimed by the prosecution.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread which was discussed in

CA-HCC 0215/2023

4 | P a g e

Woolmington v. DPP [1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held

that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

In trials of this nature, the prosecution does not only need to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt but should also ensure, with cogent evidence that

the inward journey of the production has not been disturbed at the all-

material points.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill

the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A

prosecutor should take pains to ensure that the chain of events

pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from the

Appellant from the time it was taken into custody to the time it reaches

the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should be

established.

The Appellant takes up the position that there is a significant discrepancy in

the weight of the Heroin said to have been recovered from him and the weight

of the same as recorded in the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for

the Appellant contend that the learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by

failing to analyse the discrepancy of the weight of the substance allegedly

recovered from the Appellant, which disturbs the production chain. He

CA-HCC 0215/2023

5 | P a g e

further submits that this is a substantial fact, which the prosecution has to

prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

The grounds of appeal raised in this appeal directly relates to the evidence

given by PW1 and PW4. According to PW1, the recovered substance was

weighed at the Police Narcotics Bureau in front of the Appellant. According

to both PW1 and PW4 the substance was weighed using a scale obtained

from the police. The gross aggregate weight of the substance was 16.100

grams.

When the productions were taken to the Government Analyst Department, a

notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to the Government

Analyst Report the weight of the parcel was mentioned as 8.64 grams. This

is 8.46 grams less than the original weight recorded by the police. Hence the

Appellant argues that the weight difference creates a serious doubt in the

prosecution case as the weight difference is quite significant.

When this Court invited the Respondent to explain the discrepancy regarding

the weight of the productions that which transpired from the evidence, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General following the best traditions and highest

standard of the Attorney Generals Department admitted the weight

discrepancy in the production and further added that she is unable to

explain the reason.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In the case of Koushappis v. The State of WA [2007] WASCA 26; (2007) 168

A Crim R 51 at para 85 the court held:

Whilst the safe custody of critical exhibits such as these ought to be

readily proved by clear and specific evidence rather than being left to

inference, having regard to the way the case was conducted on both

CA-HCC 0215/2023

6 | P a g e

sides, the evidence here was such in my view, as to allow the jury to be

satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs that were analysed

were in fact those seized by police from the appellants house;

The afore-mentioned judgments clearly highlight the crucial importance of

the evidence with regards to the chain of custody in drug-related offences.

They provide clear guidance on how this evidence should be presented to

satisfy the trial court. Each piece of evidence requires thorough analysis to

ascertain its origin and who had access to it, ensuring no deviations from

standard practice.

In cases regarding drug related offences, chain of custody issues is of critical

importance. The prosecution must present undisputable evidence to

establish the chain of custody of the exhibits. Additionally, they must prove

that the item presented at trial is the same item originally in the possession

of or taken from the accused. Relying on tainted, unreliable, or tampered

evidence would undermine the integrity of the judicial system.

In this regard, the learned High Court Judge had not made any comment

about the weight discrepancy in his judgment. This has caused great

prejudice to the Appellant and has effectively refused him a fair trial.

Further, although PW1 and PW2 had said that the finger prints of the

Appellants were taken to seal the production after weighing, at the trial it

was revealed that one of the Appellants signatures was absent on the sealed

envelope, regardless of which the learned High Court Judge had arrived at

the conclusion that the production had been properly sealed in the presence

of the Appellant. This is a clear misdirection which had also deprived the

Appellants a fair trial.

The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the inward journey

of the productions creates a serious doubt on the conviction against the

Appellant. Further, the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses consists

of contradictions and improbabilities.

CA-HCC 0215/2023

Considering the ground of appeal discussed above, it clearly supports the

stance taken by the Appellant in defence as well as in the dock statement

and certainly affects the root of the case.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant

by the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw dated 06.08.2021. Therefore, he

is acquitted from all charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to High Court

of Chilaw along with the original case record.
