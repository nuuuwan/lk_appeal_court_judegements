JUDGMENT

Background to the Case

1. This Appeal was submitted by the Accused-Appellant Nassar Mohammed Hussein

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) through the chief jailor of Angunakolapelassa

Prison challenging the conviction and the sentence imposed on him by the High Court of

Hambanthota.

2. The Appellant and one Mathagadeera Don Chathuranga (hereinafter referred to as the

2nd Accused) were indicted before the High Court of Hambanthota for committing the

offence of grave sexual abuse on Pradeep Maduranga Jayasuriya on or around 09-11-

1998.

3. The Indictment was served on both Accused on 20-11-2001. Thereafter, the learned High

Court Judge imposed Rs. 5000/= cash bail and Rs. 50,000/- surety bail with two sureties

residing in the Kataragama Police Division for each Accused. He also ordered the

Accused persons to submit a certificate from the Divisional Secretary to verify the

residence of the sureties. The Court, having granted time till 13-12-2001 to comply with

the bail conditions, released the Accused persons.

4. However, the Appellant had absconded and had been issued warrants on several

occasions. As the Appellant continued to abscond, the learned High Court Judge took

steps under section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code Act No. 15 of 1979 (as

amended) (hereinafter referred to as CCPA) and after having an inquiry, ordered to

proceed the trial in absentia against the Appellant.

5. In the meantime, the 2nd Accused pleaded guilty to a lesser offence under section 345 of

the Penal Code (as amended) and was sentenced to a 24 months imprisonment suspended

for 5 years. Additionally, a fine of Rs. 3500/= was imposed on the 2nd Accused.

6. After the trial against the Appellant was concluded under section 241 of the CCPA, on

27-07-2005, the learned High Court Judge imposed a 10-year rigorous imprisonment

CA/HCC/0045/2023

3 | P a g e

against the Appellant. Furthermore, he was imposed a fine of Rs. 5000/= and a default

sentence of 12 months if the Appellant fails to pay the aforesaid fine.

7. On 20-10-2022, the Appellant was arrested and produced before the Court and a Counsel

was assigned on his behalf. Thereafter, on 10-11-2022, the Assigned Counsel, in his oral

submissions stated that there are several grounds of defense that the Defense could have

taken and that there are contradictions that could have been highlighted in the

Prosecutions case.

8. The Assigned Counsel also submitted that there is no possibility of filing an appeal at that

belated stage but moved for a trial de novo under section 241(3)(b) of the CCPA.

9. It had been the contention of the learned State Counsel that none of the matters stated

above on behalf of the Appellant were bona fide reasons to absent himself from the Court

and she brought to the attention of the Court that no oral or documentary evidence has

been adduced to satisfy the Court that the Appellants absence from the Court was bona

fide.

10. The learned High Court Judge by his Order dated 10-11-2022, refused the Application

made by the Assigned Counsel for a trial de novo and ordered to give effect to the

sentence imposed on the Appellant.

11. Being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 27-05-2005, the Appellant submitted a Petition of

Appeal dated 23-11-2022, via the chief jailor of Angunakolapelassa Prison challenging

the conviction and the sentence.

12. The learned DSG raised a preliminary objection regarding the Appellants delay in filing

the Petition of Appeal.

Is the Petition of Appeal filed by the Appellant is out of time and therefore should be

dismissed in limine?

13. Section 331 (1) of the CCPA sets out the procedure to be followed when presenting a

petition of appeal or a leave to appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.

Section 331 (1) reads as;

331 (1) An appeal under this Chapter may be lodged by presenting a petition of

appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Registrar of the High Court within

CA/HCC/0045/2023

4 | P a g e

fourteen days from the date when the conviction, sentence or order sought to be

appealed against was pronounced:

Provided that a person in prison may lodge an appeal by stating within the time

aforesaid to the jailer of the prison in which he is for the time being confined his

desire to appeal and the grounds therefor and it shall thereupon be the duty of such

jailer to prepare a petition of appeal and lodge it with the High Court where the

conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced.

14. In the case of Atham Kandu Fouzer v The Honorable Attorney General CA 158/2013

(CA Minutes 07-06-2022), Gurusinghe J, held that, in terms of section 331 of the CCPA,

the petition of appeal has to be lodged with the Registrar of the High Court within

fourteen days from the date when the conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed

against was pronounced.

15. Furthermore, in Haramanis Appuhamy v Inspector of Police, Bandaragama, 66 NLR

526, Sri Skandarajah J. held that where an accused is convicted and sentenced, the time

within which an appeal should be preferred must be 5 computed from the date on which

the reasons for the decisions are given and not from the date of conviction and sentence.

16. Following the dictum of Haramanis Appuhamy, in Solicitor General v Nadarajah

Muthurajah 79 NLR 63 Pathirana J. held that the period of the time within which an

appeal should be referred must be calculated from the date on which the reasons of the

decisions are given and not from the date of which the verdict was entered.

17. In the instant case, it is important to note that the reasons for the decision and the

conviction had been given on 27-07-2005. The Petition of Appeal was filed at the

Registry of Hambanthota High Court on 24-11-2022, more than 17 years after the reasons

for the decision were given. Therefore, this Appeal is clearly out of time. Therefore, I am

inclined to uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Prosecution.

18. The learned Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that if this Court were to hold that

Petition of Appeal is out of time, it would not preclude the Appellant from inviting this

Court to exercise the inherent revisionary powers of this Court in terms of section 364 of

the CCPA. It was further submitted that the powers of revision of this Court are wide

enough to embrace a case where an appeal was refused.

CA/HCC/0045/2023

5 | P a g e

19. However, in a long line of cases, this Court has consistently held that the power of

revision is not a right of an aggrieved party but lies with the discretion of the Court and

that the conduct of the Petitioner is a relevant consideration when exercising such

discretionary powers. The Courts have refused to exercise its revisionary powers when

the Petitioner is guilty of contumacious conduct.

20. For instance, in the case of Sudarman De Silva v Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri LR 09, it

was held that, "Contumacious conduct on the part of the applicant is a relevant

consideration when the exercise of discretion in his favour is involved, but not when he

asserts his statutory right to appeal and is not asking for the favour of any permission ... "

21. Also in the case of Padmasiri v Attorney General [2012] 1 Sri LR 24, it was held, .if

we allow this application it would amount to condescending or, the court lending its

hands to a person who is guilty of contumacious conduct and thereby assisting him

22. In the case of S.M.A.A. Priyantha Jayakody v OIC, Police station, Mawarala and

Another CA/PHC/119/2004, A.W.A. Salam, J(P/CA) citing with approval the case of

Camillus Ignatious vs OIC, Uhana Police Station CA (Rev) 907/89 and Opatha

Mudiyanselage Nimal Perera vs A.G CA (Rev) 532/97 held as follows;

"Camillus Ignatious vs OIC, Uhana Police Station (Rev) CA 907/89, M.C. Ampara

2587. It was held that a mere delay of 4 months in filing a Revision Application was

fatal to the prosecution of the Revision Application. Opatha Mudiyanselage Nimal

Perera vs A.G CAC Rev) 532/97 -Kandy HC 1239/92, where His Lordship Justice

F.N.D. Jayasuriya stated that "These matters must be considered in limine before the

court decides to hear Petitioner on the merit of his application before he could pass

the gateway to relief his aforesaid contumacious conduct and his unreasonable and

undue delay in filing application mu.st be considered and determination made upon

these matters before he is heard on the merit of the application.

23. Also in Rajapakse v The State [2001] 2 Sri LR 161, it was held that;

" ... When considering this issue this Court must necessarily have regard to the

contumacious conduct of the accused in jumping bail and thereafter conducted

himself in such a manner to circumvent and subvert the process of the law and

judicial institutions. In addition if this Court were to act in revision the party must

come before Court without unreasonable delay. In the instant case there is a delay of

13 months ...

CA/HCC/0045/2023

24. In the present case, the Appellant has preferred the Petition of Appeal to this Court after

17 years from the date of the Judgment and therefore there is inordinate and undue delay

in lodging this Appeal. It appears that this delay had been caused mainly due to the fact

that the Appellant was absconding the law enforcement authorities. In other words, the

delay could be attributed to the contumacious conduct of the Appellant.

25. It is also pertinent to note that the Appellant had been served the Indictment on 20-11-

2001 and was well aware of the case pending against him. However, the Appellant had

been absconding for almost 17 years until he was arrested and produced before the Court.

Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the Appellants absence was due to his

ignorance of the case against him.

26. Given the undue delay and the contumacious conduct of the Appellant, this Court is not

inclined to exercise its revisionary powers to revise the Judgment of the learned High

Court Judge dated 27-07-2005.

27. Moreover, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there was no evidence

before the learned High Court Judge to proceed under section 241 of the CCPA.

28. However, the learned High Court Judge has conducted an inquiry prior to have the trial

in absentia against the Appellant on 27-11-2002.

29. It is important to note that, at the said inquiry, a police constable attached to Katharagama

Police Station named Herath Mudiyanselage Sampath Hasitha Bandara Herath who was

assigned with the task of executing the warrants, had given evidence stating that the

whereabouts of the Appellant could not be found despite his best efforts and that he had

inquired from the Grama Niladari and the chief prelate of the temple in the relevant area

that the Appellant was residing, about his whereabouts, but to no avail.

30. Therefore, it is quite clear that it was after holding a proper inquiry that the learned High

Court Judge has decided to hold the trial in absentia against the Appellant.

31. In Gunasiri and Others and Albara Dura Ananda v The State [1990] 2 Sri LR 265 it

was held inter alia that:

When an accused keeps away from Court deliberately, without attending the trial, it is

not necessary to hold a second inquiry before the trial commences, where the Court

has already satisfied itself after inquiry, that the accused is absconding.

CA/HCC/0045/2023

32. Furthermore, it is important to note that, in terms of section 241(3) (b) of the CCPA, for a

judge to make an order for a trial de novo, the judge has to be first satisfied that the

accuseds absence from the Court is bona fide. However, no oral or documentary

evidence has been adduced by the Assigned Counsel to satisfy the Court that the

Appellants absence from the Court was bona fide. Mere making an application to the

Court under section 241(3) (b) for a trial de novo, without adducing any evidence to

satisfy the Court that the Appellants absence from the Court is bona fide, will not satisfy

the requirements of section 241(3) (b).

33. In the aforesaid circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned

High Court Judge of Hambanthota dated 27-07-2005. Accordingly, the Appeal is

dismissed.
