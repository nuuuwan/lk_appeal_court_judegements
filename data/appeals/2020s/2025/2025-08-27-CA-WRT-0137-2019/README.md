JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. The petitioners are members of the Luxury Omnibus Owners

Association of Matugama. They claim to be holders of permits to operate

passenger transport buses on Route No. 430, plying between Matugama

and Colombo. The petitioners initially filed this application with 13

prayers; however, when this was taken up for argument on 25.06.2025,

the learned Counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Rushdie Habeeb, informed

that the petitioners will limit this application to relief prayed for by

prayers (h) and (i). The said prayers are as follows:

(h) Grant and issue a writ of prohibition preventing the 1st

respondent from regulating the Passenger Service Permit Route No.

430 Matugama Colombo via Dodangoda Kottawa/Kadawatha

and issuing permit to buses on the Expressway and preventing

from issuing any further permit.

(i) Grant and issue a writ of mandamus compelling the National

Transport Commission to regulate the Passenger Service Permit

Route No. 430 Matugama Colombo via Dodangoda

Kottawa/Kadawatha and issuing permit to buses on the

Expressway and issue permit as per the regulation in the National

Transport Act.

2. The sum total of the complaint of the petitioner is that the 1st

respondent Western Province Provincial Passenger Transport Authority

is now issuing permits to operate luxury buses in respect of Route No.

430 Matugama Colombo via the Expressway, and that the 1st

respondent does not have statutory power to so issue permits to operate

buses along the Expressway as it is a subject matter that comes within

the power of the central government. It is the position of the petitioners

that the authority competent and lawfully empowered to regulate

passenger transport along the Expressway is the National Transport

Commission (NTC). The legal basis of this argument is that

Expressways are national Highways, in view of the Gazette Notification

WRT-137-2019

Page 10 of 13

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1707/18 dated 26.05.2011. The

argument therefore, is that Article 154 (G) (1) provides for Provincial

Councils to make statutes applicable and in respect of the Provincial

Council List, and that National Highways, bridges, and ferries on

National Highways are excluded. It is further submitted that Article 154

(G) (7) clearly provides that Provincial Councils will have no power to

make statutes in respect of the Reserved List, which includes National

Transport, including railways, highways declared by or under law made

by Parliament to be National Highways. As the Southern Expressway is

now designated as National Highway, all transport along such

Expressways should be within the purview of the central government

and the NTC.

3. In support of this argument, the petitioners rely on P-23 the Attorney

Generals letter of advice dated 21.03.2017. It was also submitted that

it is the NTC that is authorized to issue passenger transport permits in

respect of transport of passengers along National Highways and

Expressways by virtue of Section 24 of the National Transport

Commission Act, No. 37 of 1991 as opined by the Attorney General.

4. As opposed to this, the Counsel for the 1st to 4th respondents submitted

that, passenger carriage services between Matugama and Colombo via

Dodangoda Kottawa/Kadawatha interchanges is within the Western

Province. As the terminal ends of the said route are within the Western

Province, the Provincial authority is empowered by virtue of Item 08 of

list 1 the Provincial Council List of the Ninth Schedule to the

Constitution. Item 08 of list 1 empowers the regulation of road

passenger carriage services within the Province. Relying on the above,

it was argued that the Provincial authorities are empowered to regulate

the passenger carriage services within the Province. This power is so

vested without distinction as to the category of roads, be it a National

Highway or otherwise.

WRT-137-2019

Page 11 of 13

5. According to the said Attorney Generals Advice letter dated 21.03.2017

(P-23), the National Highways are said to be excluded from the

Provincial Council List and by virtue of Section 8 (1) and 46H of the

National Transport Commission Act, No. 37 of 1991 (as amended) read

with Regulation I of 1998, the NTC is said to have been vested with the

authority to issue passenger service permits. It is also opined therein

that by virtue of Section 8 of the National Thoroughfares Act, No. 40 of

2008, the Minister is empowered by an Order published in the Gazette

to declare any route or public route or class of roads or public road to

be a National Highway. Then, by virtue of Section 9 (1) of the National

Thoroughfares Act, the Minister is also empowered to declare any such

National Highway as an Expressway. The said Sections are as follows:

8. (1) The Minister may by Order published in the Gazette declare

any road or public road or classes of roads or public roads to be a

national highway or national highways. as the case may be.

9. (1) The Minister may by Order published in the Gazette

designate a national highway declared in terms of section 8, to be

(a) an expressway; or

(b) a restricted access highway.

6. The Hon. Attorney General has opined that the power to issue

Passenger transport service permits pertaining to National Highways

and Expressways, be it within or outside the Province or between the

Provinces, is vested with the NTC. Based on this, the petitioners impugn

the authority of the 1st respondent Provincial Passenger Transport

Authority to issue permits along the Expressway. To this end, the Hon.

Attorney General has relied on Item 06 of the List I to the Constitution

(Provincial Council List) which reads as follows:

6. Roads and bridges and ferries thereon within the Province, other

than

(a) national highways;

(b) bridges and ferries on national highways.

WRT-137-2019

Page 12 of 13

7. A plain reading of Item 06 no doubt appears to exclude National

Highways. However, Item 08 of the said List 1 specifically provides as

follows:

8. Regulation of road passenger carriage services and the carriage

of goods by motor vehicles within the Province and the provisions

of inter-provincial road transport services.

8. The effect and import of Item No. 08 is that the Provincial Authority is

empowered to regulate road passenger carriage services within the

Province. At this juncture, it is relevant to note that the petitioners

themselves are holders of transport permits to transport passengers

along the Colombo-Galle Highway. It was admitted by the petitioners

that the road popularly known as Galle Road now designated as an

AA Road, is a National Highway. If the argument advanced is

considered in that form, along with the Attorney Generals advice, the

Provincial Transport Authority would not be competent to issue the

permits now held by the petitioner to operate the luxury bus service

along Route No. 430 between Matugama and Colombo along the

National Highway, the Galle road. The Hon. Attorney General in

expressing his opinion, has failed and not adverted to or considered the

effect and import of Item No. 08 of List 1. No doubt, in general terms,

National Highways are excluded under Item 06 of the said List. Subject

to this exclusion, Item No. 08 of the said List specifically provides for

the regulation of road passenger carriage services. Accordingly, it is

clear that the management, operation, and such other matters

pertaining to national highways had been taken out of the purview and

authority of Provincial Councils, but the regulation of road passenger

carriage services within the province had specifically been saved and

retained within the Provincial Councils authority.

9. Thus by virtue of item 6 of list 1, National Highways have been excluded

from the provincial list. That to my mind is the management and

operation of Highways. But by item 8 of list 1 regulation, passenger

WRT-137-2019

Page 13 of 13

transport within the province is retained in the provincial council list.

This was confirmed by Justice Mark Fernando in SC special

determination No. 7 of 1989 (P PA/2/PC/19) SCM 22.02.1990 where it

was held that, the council can make a statute in respect of the

provision of intra-provincial road transport services. The first limb of

item 8 of list 1 is in respect of the Regulation of passenger carriage

services within the province. This makes no express exclusion or

exception as to the regulation of passenger carriage services along

National Highways within the province.

10. The Writs of Prohibition and Mandamus sought is in respect of the

issue of route permits to ply along the expressway between

Mathugama and Colombo (route No. 430). The terminal ends of this

route are within the western province. Accordingly, as I see, the power

to regulate passenger transport within the province is vested with the

provincial authorities. That being so, the 1st respondent is vested with

the power to regulate passenger transport within the province

including the National Highways.

11. In these circumstances, I am not convinced by the arguments as

advanced on behalf of the petitioners. Thus, the said arguments

advanced on behalf of the petitioners are rejected. Accordingly, I find

that the petitioners are not entitled to the relief as prayed for and there

is no basis in law to grant the relief as prayed for by prayers (h) and (i).

12. The application is accordingly dismissed subject to cost in a sum of

Rs. 130,000/- to be paid to the 1st respondent. Each petitioner is to

pay Rs. 5,000/- thereof respectively.

Application is dismissed subject to costs.
