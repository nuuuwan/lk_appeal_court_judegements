It is submitted that these frequent visits developed into an emotional bond between the Petitioner and the Virtual Complainant (victim). It is alleged that the parties had gone on pilgrimages and visited guesthouses together. Subsequently, the Virtual Complainant (victim) filed a complaint at the Police Station, Matugama stating that the Petitioner had raped her at knifepoint. The Petitioner was then produced before the Magistrates Court under the B-report marked as X12. Following the conclusion of the non-summary inquiry, the Magistrate ordered the matter to be committed for trial before the High Court.
