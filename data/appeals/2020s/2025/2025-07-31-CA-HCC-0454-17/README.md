JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has been

indicted in the High Court of Colombo together with one other person in High

Court case number HCC 574/2001.

2. The charges in the indictment are as follows;

Charge

That between May 01, 2000 and June 30, 2000, the 1st accused-

appellant, deceived one Ratnadeshapriya Samaraweera, the manager

of the Peoples Bank branch in Ginthupitiya, and induced him to hand

over certain property to the appellant, namely bills of lading bearing

no. PONLBOM 70999283 and 70999284 and the invoices bearing no.s

MS77 and MS78 dated May 07, 2000 by dishonestly asserting that the

relevant order value of Rs.850,000 would be paid to the International

Page 3 of 9

Division of Peoples Bank and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 5(2) of the Offences Against Public Property

Act No.12 of 1982.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has convicted the

appellant of the 1st charge, acquitted the 2nd person named as the accused in

the 2nd charge, and sentenced the appellant as follows;

For a term of 26 months simple imprisonment and also imposed a

fine of Rs. 2,550,000 with a term of 3 years simple imprisonment in

default.

Case of the prosecution

4. The bank branch where PW01 served as a manager has received a set of

documents related to a consignment of goods imported into Sri Lanka by a

business entity named Durga Agencies, which have been sourced from a

business entity in India.

5. On May 22,2000 the appellant has met with PW01, who, in accordance with

the banks standard procedure provided the bills of lading and the invoices,

accompanied by a covering letter, addressed to the banks international

branch. This has been done on the appellants assurance to ensure payment

to the international branch before the goods were cleared.

6. However, although the consignment of goods had been subsequently cleared,

it has been later discovered that the additional documents related to the

payment made to the importers bank had been forged.

As a result, it is alleged that the appellant engaged in deceptive practices

against PW01, thus, committing an offence as outlined in the 1st charge in the

indictment.

Case of the appellant

7. The appellant has maintained his innocence during the proceedings. He has

asserted that he was manipulated by the person named as the 2nd accused in

the indictment into participating in transactions that, on the surface appeared

to be innocuous.

8. The crux of the appellants argument lies in the assertion that he was misled

and coerced into those dealings, which he believed to be legitimate exchanges

with PW01.

Grounds of appeal

9. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for the

appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. Whether the indictment is defective as the necessary ingredients

of the offence of cheating are not contained in the charges of the

indictment?

ii. Whether the prosecution has failed to prove the ingredient of

damage or loss caused to the government in the offence of

cheating?

iii. Whether the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

PW01 is not a credible witness and his evidence should not be

relied upon?

iv. Whether the Learned High Court Judge has failed to properly

consider and evaluate the evidence of the defence?

v. Whether the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself

by coming to erroneous or irrelevant conclusions/findings in

the judgment and therefore whether the judgment is bad in law?

Page 5 of 9

vi. Whether the sentence imposed on the appellant is excessive

considering the circumstances of the appellant?

10. The offence of cheating is described as follows in the Penal Code;

Section 398

Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly

induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any

person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or

intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do

anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived,

any which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or

harm to that person in body, mind, reputation, or property, or

damage or loss to the Government is said to cheat.

11. Cheating at common law was a misdemeanour and punishable with

imprisonment and fine. Hawkins defines cheating as deceitful practices in

defrauding or endeavouring to defraud another of his own right by means of some

artful device contrary to the plain rule of common honesty. [vide Smith and

Hogan - Criminal Law 10th edition (2003) at pages 568 to 569].

Page 6 of 9

12. The section deals with three types of cheating;

13. The allegation against the appellant is that he deceived a manager of a

particular bank based on a dishonest assertion. Following this deception, the

appellant allegedly, induced the manager to deliver two bills of lading and

invoices, marked -1 to -4 which pertained to a consignment of goods

intended for a business entity named Durga Agencies.

14. In this context, the offence committed by the appellant falls under the 2nd limb

of the offence described in section 398 of the Penal Code. Therefore, it is

unnecessary to establish that any damage or harm resulted from the actions of

the appellant.

15. The bills of lading and the invoices marked -1 to -4 pertained to a

consignment of goods imported into Sri Lanka by a business entity registered

in the country, and sourced from a business entity registered in India. These

documents marked -1 to -4 have been submitted to the importers bank,

managed by PW01, by the exporters bank, with the stipulation that they be

released to the importer only upon the settlement of the specified sum and the

remittance of the funds to the exporters bank in settlement of the exporters

dues.

16. The appellant has met with PW01 on May 22,2000. In accordance with the

standard procedures of the bank, PW01 has provided the documents marked

-1 to -4 to the appellant accompanied by a covering letter addressed to the

manager of the international branch of the bank. This has been done based on

the appellants undertaking to ensure payment to this specific branch of the

bank before the consignment of goods could be cleared. However, although the

consignment was subsequently cleared, it has been later discovered that the

additional documents concerning the payment made to the importers bank by

the importer have been forged.

17. By undertaking to make the necessary payments to the international branch of

the bank, the appellant has induced a belief in PW01 that a commitment has

been made, which was subsequently breached in substantial terms.

18. Consequently, the appellant has engaged in deceptive practices against PW01

and also intended to cause wrongful gain to the business entity involved in

importing the consignment of goods.

19. In AG vs. Wijerama [1937] 17 CLR 160 it has been held that deception is causing

to believe what is false.

20. Despite the fact that the appellant as the sole proprietor of Durga Agencies had

opened a bank account around the time of the incident outlined in the charges,

it is important to note that he had frequently visited the particular branch of

the bank managed by PW01. During these visits, the appellant has represented

other customers of the bank, attending to various banking matters. As a result

of his regular presence, he has become a familiar face at the branch,

establishing a rapport with the banks staff, particularly with PW01.

21. Given this established trust, the appellant has been viewed as a reliable and

well known individual by the bank officers. This familiarity has contributed to

Page 8 of 9

a sense of temptation on the part of PW01, potentially influencing his decisions

and actions regarding the appellant. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the

likelihood that the actions described by PW01 were influenced by this

established relationship.

22. The defence has not successfully demonstrated any animosity between PW01

and the appellant. Furthermore, the appellant has failed to identify any material

contradictions in PW01s testimony. Additionally, the appellant has not

provided any specific reasons to challenge the credibility of PW01s account.

Given these circumstances, the argument presented on behalf of the appellant

asserting that PW01 is an unreliable witness lacks merit.

23. The Learned High Court Judge has meticulously evaluated the evidence

presented by the appellant along with the testimonies of other witnesses called

to support the appellants case. In conducting this evaluation, the Learned High

Court Judge has approached the matter holistically rather than dissecting

evidence in a piecemeal fashion. This comprehensive analysis has allowed for

an in depth understanding of the case as a whole, ensuring that the context

and the interrelationships of the evidence were considered.

24. Moreover, the Learned High Court Judge has provided clear and cogent reasons

for any conclusions drawn, particularly for the decision not to rely on specific

pieces of evidence. By articulating these reasons, the Learned High Court Judge

has demonstrated a commitment to transparency and fairness, allowing for an

informed assessment of the credibility and relevance of each witnesss

testimony.

25. Furthermore, the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge is in line

with the provisions of section 5(2) of the Offences Against Public Property Act

No.12 of 1982, with the fine being three times the amount related to the offence

committed.

26. Due to the reasons stated above, I am not inclined to interfere with the

conviction and the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order. I

dismiss the appeal. I make no order regarding costs.

Appeal dismissed.

27. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo for compliance.
