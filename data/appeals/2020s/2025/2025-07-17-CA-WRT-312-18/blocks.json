When this application was taken up for support on 15.10.2018 in the first instant, having heard the submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, as well as the learned State Counsel, this Court had refused to issue notices on the Respondents as the Court was of the view that this is not a fit case in which the Court should exercise its discretionary writ jurisdiction. In the above numbered application Supreme Court dismissed the judgement of this Court dated 15.10.2018, determining that this is a matter where the Court of Appeal should have issued notices on the Respondents and referred back with the direction that notices be issued on the Respondents (see document marked CA-22). The Petitioners submit that the Supreme Court, having heard the submissions made by both parties on the identical objection regarding laches, overruled the said objection and therefore, the Respondents cannot be allowed to re-agitate the same issue of laches.",

It also means unreasonable delay in pursuing a legal remedy whereby a party forfeits the benefit upon the principle vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt. The neglect to assert one's rights or the acquiescence in the assertion or adverse rights will have the effect of barring a person from the remedy which he might have had if he resorted to it in proper time. (Mozley & Whiteley's Law Dictionary 10th Ed pg 260). When it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equal to waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were to be afterwards asserted, in either of these cases lapse of time and delay are most material.",
