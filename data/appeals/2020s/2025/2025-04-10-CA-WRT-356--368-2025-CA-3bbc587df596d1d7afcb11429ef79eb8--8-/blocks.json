    "text": "For the reasons set forth above, I hold that the passing observations/ remarks made by the Supreme Court in the referenced Fundamental Rights applications carry no binding authority over these proceedings under the doctrine of stare decisis. Thus, I hold in terms of the determination made by this Court in Kurusamys case and Sagara Kariyawasams case, the copies of the birth certificate certified by the Justice of Peace or the Notary Public are valid in law, and the declarations tendered in accordance with the 7th schedule of the Constitution are also valid in law in terms of the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. Accordingly, a writ of certiorari quashing the decisions of the Returning Officers rejecting the nomination papers is issued. A mandamus directing the returning officers to accept the said nomination papers is also issued. Applications are allowed without costs.",
