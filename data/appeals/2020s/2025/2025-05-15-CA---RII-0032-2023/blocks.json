The petitioner filed this application before this court seeking to set aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 16-03-2023, in the case of HC 2492/21 marked X7, ordering the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 1.5 million as forfeiture due to a Bond entered into by the petitioner. The petitioner was the surety in the Magistrates Court of Fort on behalf of the petitioners daughter, in the case bearing no. B 1220/13 as surety to lift the travel ban imposed on the suspect (daughter of the petitioner) (hereinafter referred to as the suspect). The CID produced the suspect before the Magistrates Court of Fort on 10-01-2014, in connection with criminal misappropriation of money belonging to the complainant-respondent. The suspect was granted bail on 29-01-2014 by the Learned Magistrate of Fort. The bail conditions were to furnish Rs. 50,000/- cash bail and Rs. 1.0 million surety bail with two sureties. In addition, an overseas travel ban was imposed on the suspect. The suspect was released from remand, furnishing the above condition. The petitioner was not a surety for the suspect. There were two different sureties. The case was called several days before the Magistrates Court. On 02-12-2020, an application was made on behalf of the suspect seeking to lift the travel ban imposed on the suspect temporarily. The Learned Magistrate of Fort lifted the travel ban imposed on the suspect until the next calling date of the case on condition of Rs. 20.0 million surety bond and the petitioner, the mother of the suspect, to stand as the surety.

There is a minute dated 30-03-2021 which says, Registrar of the High Court of Colombo, mentioning two High Court case numbers, requested to send original case record and the productions. The Learned Magistrate made an Order to send the original case records and the productions to the High Court and keep a sub-file. The case bearing no. B 1220/2013 was not called thereafter. There were three cases filed against the suspect in the High Court of Colombo in different divisions. In the case of HC 2486/21, the suspect appeared before the High Court on 26-01-2023 as the accused. She pleaded guilty to the indictment on 03-02-2023. Accordingly, she was convicted and imposed a one-year rigorous imprisonment, which was suspended for five years, and imposed a Rs. 5,000/- fine. It further ordered that once the fine was paid, the travel ban would be lifted, and later, since the fine was paid, the passport was released to the accused. Thus, one case against the suspect was terminated. In the High Court Case of HC 2487/21, the suspect was present in Court on 25-01-2023, and she was ordered to furnish bail. On 10-02-2023, the accused informed the Court of her willingness to plead guilty to the indictment. On 22-02-2023, the accused pleaded guilty while the PW1 requested to have Rs. 35,000/- as compensation. Accordingly, the accused was convicted and imposed a one-year rigorous imprisonment, which was suspended for five years, and also imposed a Rs. 5,000/- fine with a one-month simple imprisonment as a default sentence. The accused paid the fine and Rs. 35,000/- compensation to PW1; thus, the second case against the suspect was terminated. Another case bearing no. HC 2492/21 has been filed against the suspect. The three cases against the suspect were taken up before different divisions of the High Court of Colombo. The suspect did not appear before the High Court for this case. The Learned High Court Judge issued notices on the two sureties of the suspect in the Magistrates Court Case No. B1220/13 and issued notice to the petitioner. The Learned High Court Judge discharged the two sureties on 16-03-2023, because the Learned Magistrate lifted the travel ban imposed on the suspect without informing the two sureties. As the forfeiture of the surety bond, the Learned High Court Judge imposed a fine of Rs. 1.5 million on the petitioner with a default term of 24 months,",

According to that Order, the petitioner stood as surety for the purpose of lifting the travel ban imposed against the suspect for a certain period. On the due date for the suspect to appear before the Magistrates Court, the case was not called due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, the Magistrates Court Case was never called. The Honourable Attorney General has filed three indictments before the High Court of Colombo against the suspect in the case of B 1220/13 in the Magistrates Court. At the conclusion of the High Court cases No. HC 2486/2021on 03-02-2023 and HC 2487/2021on 22-02-2023 respectively, the respective State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General failed to inform the court that there was another case against the accused, arising from the same B report, especially when the accused made an application to lift the travel ban at the conclusion of the HC 2486/2021. The State Counsel did not raise any objection to the application of the accused, to lift the travel ban. Moreover, the court was not informed that another indictment had been filed against the accused, based on the same facts of the B Report No. B 1220/13). If all three cases against the accused were filed in the same division of the High Court and called before one High Court Judge, the travel ban would not have been lifted until all three cases were concluded. According to the order of the Learned Magistrate on 02-12-2020, the petitioners duty was to ensure that the suspect would appear before the Court on the next date after travelling abroad. After 02-12-2020, the suspect had come to Sri Lanka and appeared before the High Court for two cases. Therefore, the petitioner has duly fulfilled her duty to ensure that the suspect returns to Sri Lanka and appears before the Court. The question arises as to how the petitioner, the elderly mother of the suspect, could reasonably have anticipated that one case before the Magistrates Court would split into three separate cases and subsequently be filed in the High Court. The provisions in section 405 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 provide as follows: 405. (1) Before any person is released on bail or released on his own bond a bond for such sum of money as the officer or court as the case may be thinks sufficient shall be executed by such person, and when he is released on bail by one or more sufficient sureties, conditioned that such person shall attend at the time and place mentioned in the bond and shall continue so to attend until otherwise directed.",

Sub-section 2 of section 405 of the Criminal Procedure Code specifically provides that if the person so released on bail is to appear in the High Court or other Court, the bond must expressly say so. The bond that the petitioner signed on 03-12-2020 does not indicate that the surety is bound to produce the suspect before the High Court. The petitioner undertook before the Magistrates Court to see that the suspect shall appear in the above Court on 17-03-2021 and continue to appear until otherwise directed by the Court. There was no such direction from the Magistrates Court to the petitioner. The petitioner fulfilled her obligation to produce the suspect before the Court after travelling overseas. After obtaining permission from the Magistrates Court to travel overseas on 03-12-2020, the suspect appeared before the High Court in two cases. In Emperor v. Chintaram AIR 1936 Nag 243 (1), it was held: Where there is no mention in surety bond of the court in which the accused is to appear, the bond cannot be enforced. The fact that surety did not produce the accused in a totally different Court, even supposing he had undertaken to produce him in a particular court, is not a breach of the bond, and surety is not liable. The term of surety bond have to be determined by the language used in the bond itself. In the case of Bhoop Singh v State of Madhya Bharat, 1954 Cri. LJ 334: AIR 1954 Madh-B 8 (k) it was held: Where a security bond is given for attendance and production of the accused in a particular Court only, the liability of the surety comes to end when the case is transferred to another court and in such a case bond cannot be forfeited for failure of the accused to appear before transferee Court. In the case of Abdul Hameed vs. Kalmunai Police,47 NLR 212, the facts are briefly as follows;",

He was subsequently given time to pay the fine which was due from him. Thereafter, the accused did not appear and the Magistrate ordered the suretys bond to be forfeited. The Supreme Court held that the term of the suretys bond was fulfilled when the accused appeared on April 23, 1945, and the suretys liability came to an end on that date. Having considered the facts of the case and the applicable law, I am of the view that the petitioners obligation as a surety was discharged once the suspect, having travelled abroad with the court's permission granted on 02-12-2020, duly appeared before the High Court as an accused. The Learned High Court Judge discharged the other two sureties on the premise that the Learned Magistrate had granted permission to the suspect to travel overseas without informing the two sureties. Likewise, the Learned High Court Judge could have considered the fact that in the case of HC 2492/2021, the Learned High Court Judge lifted the travel ban imposed on the accused and released her passport. Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge imposed a default term of 24 months' simple imprisonment against the petitioner, violating the expressed provisions of sub-section 4 of section 422 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The default term imposed on the petitioner by the Learned High Court is illegal. 422 (4) is as follows: If such penalty be not paid and cannot be recovered by such attachment and sale the person so bound shall be liable by order of the court which issued the warrant to simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months.

Undoubtedly, the application of the concept pertaining to the grant of bail, cancellation, forfeiture etc, requires a greater command of the legal principles. It is an established principle of law that the grant of bail is a judicial discretion and not a mere discretion. (Emphasis is mine.) An important decision on the exercise of discretion is worth being referred to at this stage. In the case of Roberts vs. Hopwood and others, 1925 AC page 578 at page 613, Lord Wrenbury (House of Lords) voiced his opinion as to the manner in which judicial discretion should be exercised, in the following words.",

    "text": "\"The person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so- he must, in the exercise of his discretion, do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his reason, ascertain and follow the cause which reasons direct. He must act reasonably.\" . No court has jurisdiction or authority to pass an order of cancellation of a bail bond or to declare a bond as forfeited, otherwise than in accordance with the statutory provisions. It is settled law that a surety bond has to be strictly construed because the violation of its terms provides for interference with the personal liberty and or deprivation of property rights. In the present case, as pointed out above, the bond was forfeited for an alleged violation of a condition that was neither stipulated in the bond itself nor reflected in the order of the Magistrate. For the reasons enumerated in this judgment, I hold that the petitioner has not violated the conditions of the surety bond she entered into in the Magistrates Court of Fort. The Order of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo to forfeit the bond against the petitioner is not valid in law. Therefore, the order dated 16-03-2023, in the case of HC 2492/21 marked X7, directing the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 1.5 million, and imposing a 24-month default term is hereby set aside, and the petitioner is discharged. The application of the petitioner is allowed.",
