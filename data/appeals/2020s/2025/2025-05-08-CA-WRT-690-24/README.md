Dr. Romesh De Silva, P.C. with Ruwantha Cooray for the 19th Respondents, instructed by Mr. Sanath Wijewardane. Argued on : 20.02.2025 and 10.03.2025 Decided on : 08.05.2025

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Petitioner, an accomplished Chartered Engineer with over twenty-

nine years of experience in civil engineering and infrastructure

development, serves as the Deputy Director General (Special Projects) in

the Senior Management Category (HM 2-1) of the Road Development

Authority (hereinafter the 1st Respondent Authority or RDA), a

statutory body established under the Road Development Authority Act

No. 73 of 1981 as amended (hereinafter the RDA Act).

By internal circular dated 09.02.2024, the RDA invited applications for

the post of Director General. In terms of the internal memo marked P9(b),

internal candidates were assessed under the criteria applicable to

external applicants. The Petitioner and the 19th Respondent, among

others, applied for the post. Interviews were held on 27.02.2024 by a

panel comprising the 11th, 20th and 21st Respondents. Thereafter, a

marking sheet containing the scores of all applicants was compiled,

pursuant to which the names of the top three candidates were

transmitted to the Board of Directors of the RDA for further

consideration.

On or about 05.03.2024, the 19th Respondent was appointed Director

General of the RDA. The Petitioner, aggrieved by what he alleges to be an

arbitrary and procedurally improper selection process, particularly given

that he had obtained the highest score at the interview (63/100)

compared to the 19th Respondents 61/100, instituted this application

by Petition dated 25.10.2024. He challenges the said appointment on

several grounds, including violation of the Scheme of Recruitment

(SOR), absence of transparency, denial of legitimate expectation, and

failure to adhere to the marking order and merit-based criteria stipulated

in the SOR.

8

The matter was supported before this Court on 04.11.2024, 11.11.2024

and 05.12.2024. On 04.11.2024, this Court issued an interim order

directing the production of the marking sheet in the order of merit. By

motion dated 07.11.2024, the 14th Respondent filed the marking sheet,

which confirmed that the Petitioner had secured the highest score. The

Respondents were thereafter directed to file their Statements of

Objections by 24.01.2025, and the Petitioner was directed to file his

counter objections by 06.02.2025.

In the various Statements of Objections filed by the Respondents, several

preliminary objections were raised, including laches, futility of the

application, suppression of material facts, and the purported discretion

vested in the Board of Directors and the Minister under Section 12(1) of

the RDA Act to appoint a suitable candidate. The Petitioner, in response,

contends that the approved Scheme of Recruitment requires strict

adherence to merit-based selection and that the Respondents acted ultra

vires in nominating a candidate who had not obtained the highest score.

THE PETITIONERS CONTENTION

The Petitioner contends that his non-selection for the post of Director

General of the 1st Respondent Authority, despite having obtained the

highest mark at the duly constituted interview, constitutes a flagrant

violation of the law, the rules of natural justice, and due process. The

gravamen of his grievance lies in the arbitrary, ultra vires, and

procedurally improper appointment of the 19th Respondent to the said

post, contrary to the approved Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) and

established administrative norms.

The Petitioner avers that he is a senior and highly qualified professional

with nearly three decades of experience in engineering and infrastructure

development. His academic and professional qualifications include A BSc.

9

in Civil Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, A Master of

Engineering in Highway & Traffic Engineering, Fellow of the Institution of

Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) and a Registered International Professional

Engineer.

The Petitioner further states that he has held various senior posts within

the RDA, including, Chief Engineer for the Outer Circular Highway

Project, Project Director for both the Southern Expressway Extension and

Port Access Elevated Highway Projects, Deputy Director General (Special

Projects) at the time of applying for the post of Director General.

Throughout his service, the Petitioner has received multiple

commendations from the RDA and Ministry officials, evidencing a track

record of excellence, including significant improvements in project

completion metrics under his leadership.

The Petitioner responded to an internal call for applications for the post

of Director General issued via memo dated 09.02.2024. He submitted his

application on or about 19.02.2024 under the criteria applicable to

external candidates, in terms of the internal circular P9(b).

Following preliminary evaluation, the Petitioner was shortlisted and

interviewed on 27.02.2024 by a panel comprising the 11th, 20th, and

21st Respondents. The Petitioner contends that:

The interview was conducted without transparency regarding the method

of awarding marks, He was later informed, indirectly, that three top-

scoring applicants were referred to the Board of Directors. The Petitioner

scored 63/100, the highest among all applicants, whereas the 19th

Respondent scored 61/100.

10

The Petitioner impugns the subsequent appointment of the 19th

Respondent on or around 05.03.2024 as being Arbitrary and Ultra Vires,

in breach of the SOR which mandated appointment strictly based on

merit order at the interview (as reflected in the marking sheet marked

R1), Procedurally flawed, as the selection was made without disclosure

or explanation of deviations from the ranking or the method of final

determination, Carried out with collateral intent, aimed at preferring a

less meritorious candidate (i.e., the 19th Respondent) based on seniority,

a criterion not recognised in the applicable SOR for external candidates,

and is a violation of the Petitioners legitimate expectation, grounded in a

fair and transparent selection process.

The Petitioner also points to the deliberate withholding of the marking

sheet, which was only produced after the Courts interim order dated

04.11.2024 directing its disclosure. The Petitioner further states that an

attempt to retrospectively amend the SOR by a letter dated 17.01.2025

(marked AI), requesting changes to the appointment criteria after the

fact, demonstrates the mala fides of the Respondents and the

acknowledged irregularity of the original appointment.

In said circumstances the Petitioner has prayed for a writ of certiorari to

quash the appointment of the 19th Respondent as Director General and

a writ of mandamus compelling the Respondents to make a lawful

appointment strictly in accordance with the approved SOR and the

marking order,

The Petition is thus premised on the assertion that the entire

appointment process was vitiated by illegality, procedural unfairness,

and disregard for the governing recruitment framework, and seeks the

intervention of this Court to vindicate the rule of law.

11

POSITION OF THE 1ST TO 18TH RESPONDENTS (RDA BOARD AND

OFFICERS)

The 1st to 18th Respondents submit that the Petition is liable to be

dismissed in limine on multiple preliminary grounds, namely, Laches, on

account of the delay in filing, Futility, as the Petitioners claims are moot

and ineffective, Material non-disclosure, alleging suppression and/or

misrepresentation of material facts, and that the Petitioner has no locus

to invoke the Courts discretionary jurisdiction.

Without prejudice to the preliminary objections, these Respondents deny

the substantive claims and maintain that the appointment of the 19th

Respondent was made in good faith and within the statutory framework

provided under Section 12 of the Road Development Authority Act No. 73

of 1981 (as amended), in compliance with internal administrative

protocols and ministerial approval.

They admit that the Petitioner was called for an interview on 27.02.2024

and participated therein, but emphasize that the top three candidates

were forwarded in alphabetical order to the Board of Directors by the

23rd Respondent (Secretary to the Ministry), the Board took into account

not only the interview marks but also the seniority, institutional

experience, and the best interests of the Authority and that the 19th

Respondent, having served the RDA for 28 years and held the position of

Additional Director General, was deemed more appropriate based on

overall suitability, notwithstanding his slightly lower score at the

interview (61/100 as opposed to the Petitioners 63/100).

They further submit that seniority is a valid and relevant consideration

under Section 12 of the RDA Act, there is no mandatory requirement that

appointment must be made strictly according to interview marks alone

and that the SOR is merely administrative, and cannot override the

12

statutory discretion conferred upon the Board and the Minister under the

RDA Act. Thus it is submitted by them that the Petitioner's contention

that the appointment violated the SOR or merit order should be rejected

as untenable in law.

POSITION OF THE 19TH RESPONDENT (APPOINTED DIRECTOR

GENERAL)

The 19th Respondent adopts a firm stance that his appointment was

lawful, regular, and validly effected under and in terms of Section 12 of

the RDA Act, following due process and ministerial approval.

The 19th Respondent denying the Petitioners claim that the selection

process was irregular or that the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation

of appointment. In particular, he states that the appointment was made

by the lawfully constituted appointing authority, the Court should not

seek to usurp the statutory discretion vested in that authority and that

the Petitioner has failed to establish any grounds of judicial review, such

as illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety, necessary to vitiate

the decision.

The 19th Respondent disputes the weight the Petitioner places on the

interview marking sheet and emphasizes that merit alone is not

determinative, he himself is a senior officer with 28 years of service, has

held high-ranking positions including Additional Director General, and

also states that the appointing authority properly considered overall

competence, experience, and suitability, which cannot be reduced to

numerical scores alone.

The 19th Respondent further submits that the Petitioners present claim

is a convenient afterthought, especially given that the Petitioner had

13

previously failed to secure other senior appointments, including as

Additional Director General in mid-2024.

The 19th Respondent characterizes the Petition as an attempt to

improperly challenge a valid appointment, made with no evidence of bias,

mala fides, or procedural misconduct, and thus prays that the Petition be

dismissed in limine with costs.

POSITION OF THE 21ST TO 26TH RESPONDENTS (INTERVIEW

PANEL AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS)

These Respondents, comprising members of the interview panel and

officials from the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil

Aviation, also raise preliminary objections including laches, non-

disclosure, and misconceived legal grounds, seeking the dismissal of the

Petition in limine.

On the merits, they state that the interview process was conducted in a

fair, transparent, and objective manner, the top three scoring candidates

were forwarded to the appointing authority in alphabetical order without

recommendation or ranking preference and that the ultimate

appointment was made by the 1st Respondent Authoritys Board and the

Minister, and not by the interview panel.

These Respondents maintain that the SOR was followed up to the point

of interview and ranking, but it was not binding on the appointing

authority in determining final selection. They also submit that the

Petitioners interpretation of the SOR as requiring strict appointment

solely based on interview scores is misplaced and inconsistent with the

discretion conferred under Section 12 of the RDA Act.

14

Additionally, they note that the 19th Respondent had the second highest

score (61/100), equal to another candidate, The Board of Directors and

the Minister considered seniority, institutional knowledge, and service

needs, and were satisfied that the 19th Respondent was most suitable.

They also submit that the approval by the Minister vests legal authority

and finality to the appointment.

These Respondents also deny any allegations of bias, collusion, or

procedural irregularity, and state that the Petitioners reliance on

legitimate expectation is unsustainable, as no assurance or

representation was ever made to him concerning the outcome.

OBSERVATIONS OF THIS COURT

The primary legal instrument governing the appointment of the Director

General of the Road Development Authority (RDA) is Section 12(1) of the

Road Development Authority Act No. 73 of 1981 (as amended), which

provides:

The Authority shall, with the approval in writing of the Minister,

appoint a Director-General of the Authority.

This section vests the RDA with the authority to appoint a Director

General subject to ministerial approval, while leaving the method of

selection to be governed by the approved Scheme of Recruitment (SOR),

which functions as an administrative guide governing merit-based

evaluation.

The approved SOR (marked P20(c) and 1R4) explicitly stipulates that

appointments shall be made purely in the order of merit at the interview,

and that all recruitments shall be strictly in compliance with the SOR.

15

Page 103 of the SOR states: All recruitments to this category shall be

strictly in compliance with the provision of this Scheme of Recruitment.

Page 104 of the SOR states: Appointment will be made purely in the order

of merit at the interview.

The core of the Petitioners legal argument is that the Respondents acted

ultra vires the governing statutory and administrative framework, in

appointing the 19th Respondent despite the Petitioner obtaining the

highest interview score of 63/100, while the 19th Respondent secured

only 61/100, which he shared with another candidate. The Petitioner

states that:

The SOR was binding, and any deviation from the ranking order

constitutes a material illegality. He relies on the clause in the SOR

which mandates that appointments shall be made "purely in the

order of merit at the interview".

The interview panels function was limited to evaluation, final

selection must adhere to the SOR and the published ranking sheet

(marked R1).

The concealment of the marking sheet until an interim order by

this Court on 04.11.2024, and the subsequent attempt to amend

the SOR retrospectively by letter dated 17.01.2025 (marked AI),

evinces mala fides and procedural manipulation.

The invocation of seniority as a decisive factor is contrary to the

SOR, which makes no reference to seniority as a basis for selection

under the external category. All candidates were evaluated under

the external category, including the 19th Respondent, who was also

an Additional Director General since 10.11.2023.

16

The Petitioner accordingly contends that the appointment is null and void

ab initio, and must be quashed by way of certiorari, and a fresh

appointment made strictly in line with the merit order prescribed by the

SOR.

The Respondents argue collectively that:

The appointment was made pursuant to the discretion conferred

under Section 12 of the RDA Act, which is not fettered by the SOR.

They characterize the SOR as non-binding and administrative in

nature.

The Board and Minister are entitled to consider factors beyond

marks, including Seniority, Leadership experience, Institutional

familiarity, Long-standing service and overall suitability for the

post.

The 19th Respondent was lawfully appointed by the competent

authority, having served 28 years and having secured the second-

highest mark, equal to another applicant, and thus fell within the

shortlisted top three candidates.

No representation or legitimate expectation arose in the Petitioners

favour, nor has he established any procedural impropriety or bad

faith. Mere dissatisfaction with the result is not grounds for judicial

review, especially in ligviewht of the presumption of regularity that

attaches to official acts.

The Respondents thus contend that the Court ought not to interfere with

what is essentially an administrative decision taken in good faith, absent

manifest unreasonableness or illegality.

The Respondents have placed reliance on Clauses 4.4 and 4.5 of the

approved SOR to justify the appointment of the 19th Respondent despite

17

the Petitioner obtaining the highest marks at the interview. It is

contended that Clause 4.4 confined the role of the interview panel to

merely shortlisting candidates, and that Clause 4.5 vested the Board of

Directors with discretion to assess the broader suitability of candidates

for final appointment, which may include considerations such as

seniority, institutional familiarity, or leadership traits. However, this

Court is not persuaded that such clauses can be interpreted in isolation

to confer a licence to disregard the clear and mandatory provisions of the

SOR. Mandatory clauses at page 104 and 103 admit of no exception.

If Clauses 4.4 and 4.5 were to be interpreted as authorising the Board to

override the interview-based merit order, such an interpretation would

nullify the binding force of the merit principle and render the recruitment

process vulnerable to arbitrariness and subjective preferences. This

Court is of the view that Clauses 4.4 and 4.5, properly construed, do not

confer an unfettered discretion but must be read harmoniously and

restrictively, within the overarching framework of the SOR, which

prioritises objectivity, transparency, and merit-based selection. It is the

view of this court that any contrary interpretation would violate the

principle of legitimate expectation and amount to procedural impropriety.

This court observes that the SOR is clear and unequivocal in requiring

that appointments shall be made purely in the order of merit at the

interview, with no express discretion reserved for deviation. The

Petitioner scored the highest marks in the marking sheet (R1), which

was produced only upon Court direction, suggesting a lack of

transparency in the process. The attempt to retrospectively amend the

SOR by the 2nd Respondent via letter dated 17.01.2025, post-

appointment, indicates an ex post facto justification of an otherwise

irregular process. The Respondents themselves concede that all

candidates were assessed under the external category, making seniority

18

irrelevant as per the SOR. The Petitioners claim of legitimate expectation,

is grounded on adherence to published criteria.

In this context, this court notes that the SOR was not followed, and no

compelling reason was provided for deviation from the express merit-

based appointment requirement, undermining the legality of the final

appointment. Furthermore, the post attempt to amend the SOR, and the

failure to disclose the marking sheet until ordered by Court, suggest lack

of transparency and failure to act in good faith. Their invocation of

seniority is inconsistent with the category under which all candidates

were assessed, namely, the external stream, which did not permit such

consideration.

CONCLUSION

This Court has carefully considered the pleadings, affidavits, objections,

counter-objections, and all documentary material tendered by the

parties, as well as the oral and written submissions advanced on behalf

of the respective parties.

At the heart of the instant application lies the question of whether the

appointment of the 19th Respondent as Director General of the Road

Development Authority was made in accordance with law, and more

particularly, whether the procedure adopted by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents, culminating in the impugned appointment, conformed to

the requirements of the approved Scheme of Recruitment and principles

of natural justice.

It is not in dispute that by internal memorandum dated 09.02.2024,

applications were invited for the post of Director General of the RDA, and

that both the Petitioner and the 19th Respondent duly applied under the

criteria applicable to the external category, as per the internal directive

19

marked P9(b). An interview panel comprising the 11th, 20th, and 21st

Respondents conducted interviews on 27.02.2024. The marking sheet,

subsequently filed upon this Courts direction dated 04.11.2024 and

marked R1, confirms that the Petitioner was awarded 63/100, the

highest score among all candidates, while the 19th Respondent secured

61/100, which he shared with another candidate.

The approved Scheme of Recruitment, marked P20(c) in the Petition

and 1R4 in the Respondents pleadings, clearly states that

appointments to the post of Director General shall be made purely in the

order of merit at the interview and that all recruitments to this category

shall be strictly in compliance with the provisions of this Scheme. There

is no ambiguity in these provisions. The SOR contains no reference to

additional considerations such as seniority, institutional familiarity,

or service tenure for candidates evaluated under the external stream.

The Respondents contend, however, that Section 12(1) of the RDA Act

vests the RDA with discretion to appoint a Director General, subject to

ministerial approval, and that this discretion encompasses the right to

consider qualitative factors beyond the marking sheet, including

seniority, suitability, and institutional knowledge. It is further contended

that the SOR is merely administrative and does not override the statutory

authority of the RDA Board or the Minister.

This Court is unable to accept the Respondents' interpretation of Section

12(1) as affording untrammelled discretion to deviate from the express

terms of the SOR. While Section 12(1) does empower the Authority to

appoint a Director General with the approval of the Minister, such power

must be exercised in a manner that is lawful, reasonable, and consistent

with binding administrative rules, including approved schemes of

recruitment. The SOR, having been approved by the relevant Ministry

and adopted by the RDA, constitutes a mandatory framework governing

20

the selection process. The use of the term shall within the SOR denotes

imperative compliance with the merit-based ranking system, thereby

eliminating the scope for extraneous considerations in final

appointments, absent amendment of the SOR through lawful means.

The Respondents' reliance on seniority as a justification for departing

from the marking order is particularly misplaced. The record confirms

that all candidates were evaluated under the external stream, and no

provision within the SOR permits the invocation of seniority within this

stream. The attempt by the 2nd Respondent to amend the SOR, through

a letter dated 17.01.2025, referencing a discrepancy between the SOR

and Section 12 of the RDA Act, strongly supports the Petitioners

contention that the impugned appointment was procedurally irregular

and legally flawed.

The doctrine of legitimate expectation necessitates that the recruitment

process be conducted in strict adherence to the binding provisions of the

approved Scheme of Recruitment, upon which the Petitioner was entitled

to reasonably rely.

In Junaideen Mohamed Iqbal v. The Divisional Secretary, Kundasale

(CA/Writ/328/2015, CA Minutes of 19.02.2020), the Court of Appeal

articulated the principle of legitimate expectation in the following terms:

When a public authority represents that it will or will not do

something within its authority and later attempts to rescind the said

representation, a person who has reasonably relied on it should be

entitled to enforce it by law. This concept is based on the principles

of natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent the abuse of

power by public authorities

21

Further, Wade and Forsyth, in their authoritative treatise Administrative

Law (11th Edition, at p. 451 - 452), discuss the rationale for protecting

legitimate expectations as follows:

A further and more satisfactory reason for the protection of

legitimate expectations lies in the trust that has been reposed by the

citizen in what he has been told or led to believe by the official. Good

government depends upon trust between the governed and the

governor. Unless that trust is sustained and protected, officials will

not be believed and the government becomes a choice between chaos

and coercion.

It is not enough that an expectation should exist: it must in

addition be legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether a

particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a difficult area

since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be

found to be legitimate because of some countervailing consideration

of policy or law.

A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself be clear,

unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimants fail at this hurdle

after a close analysis of the assurance. The test is how, on a fair

reading of the promise, it would have been reasonably understood

by those to whom it was made

The deviation from the merit based ranking order, in the absence of a

legally cognizable justification, amounts to a violation of that expectation,

and is amenable to judicial review. Where the decision-making process is

infected by illegality, irrationality, procedural impropriety, or breach of

binding rules, this Court is not only entitled but obligated to intervene.

The Respondents have failed to demonstrate that the appointment of the

22

19th Respondent, despite his lower score, was legally justifiable within

the bounds of the governing SOR and applicable statutory provisions.

In these circumstances, the Petitioners grievance is well founded in law,

and the appointment of the 19th Respondent is liable to be quashed for

being ultra vires, arbitrary, and procedurally unlawful. This Court is

satisfied that the Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs set out in prayers (c),

(d), (e), and (f) of the Petition, and the same are hereby granted.

Application allowed. No Costs.
