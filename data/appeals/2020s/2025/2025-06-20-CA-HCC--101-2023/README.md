JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General in the High

Court of Hambantota for committing three counts of statutory rape

punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal Code as amended on

Hanguranketha Lekam Mudiyanselage Nisanka Madhusani between

01/02/2008 and 19/03/2008.

The trial could not be started as the victim had sworn an affidavit to effect

that she is not willing to come to court and give evidence in this case. The

reason she has averred that as she is having a good family life, giving

evidence in court would certainly disturb her family life.

During the pendency of the trial, it transpired that the victim had given birth

to a child due to this incident. As such, the Learned State Counsel with the

concurrence of the defence made an application to the court to call for a DNA

Report of the victim, the Appellant, and the child. Accordingly, the report was

called and it revealed that the Appellant is the biological father of the child

born out of this statutory rape incident.

Considering the DNA Report the Appellant through his Counsel expressed

his willingness to plead guilty to the charges unconditionally. Accordingly,

the plea of guilt was recorded on 16.02.2023 and the Learned High Court

Judge had passed the following sentence on the Appellant.

The Appellant was sentenced to 12 years rigorous imprisonment for each

count to run consecutively. Accordingly, the Appellant was sentenced to 36

years rigorous imprisonment in total.

In addition, a fine of Rs.5000/ was imposed on each count with default

sentence of 06 month each. Further, a compensation of Rs.600,000/-was

ordered to pay to the victim by the Appellant with a default sentence of 02

years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he was connected via Zoom from prison.

At the very outset of the argument the Learned Counsel for the Appellant

informed this Court that the Appellant is only contesting the sentence

imposed to run consecutively in relation to the three counts where the

Appellant had pleaded guilty.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

The prosecutrix in this case was living with her sister as her mother had

employed in Colombo. Using this opportunity the Appellant had raped her

several times. As the appellant threatened her that he would harm her family

members, she remained silent until she was found pregnant.

The victim was 15 years old when she was raped by the Appellant. The

Appellant was 47 years old when he committed this offence.

When a person accused of a crime pleads guilty or has been found guilty, the

judge orders a sentence. The judge takes several factors into account when

deciding on a sentence, including the circumstances surrounding the crime

and the situation of the person who committed the crime.

The sentence must be in proportion to the seriousness of the crime. The law

establishes how serious a crime is by providing different sentences for

different types of crimes. This means lighter sentences for less serious

crimes and heavier sentences for more serious crimes. According to the

principle of fairness in sentencing, the sentence must be just.

As in other countries, no sentencing guidelines have been formulated in our

jurisdiction. Therefore, sentencing is the prerogative of the court in our

jurisdiction.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had passed 12 years rigorous

imprisonment on each count of rape and for the three counts the Appellant

was sentence to 36 years rigorous imprisonment. As the Appellant pleaded

guilty to the indictment, the Counsel argues that the sentence imposed

against him was excessive.

When sentencing in individual cases, the court must strike a balance

between the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the maximum sentence

available under the law and the seriousness of the actual acts of the person.

In the case of Attorney General v H.N.Silva 57 NLR 121 the Court held

that:

" A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence, first consider the

gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and

should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or

other statute under which the offender is charged. He should also

regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what

extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or

belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence that must be

taken into account in assessing the punishment. The incidence of crimes

of the nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty and the

difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an

important consideration, is subordinate to the others I have mentioned.

Where the public interest or the welfare of the State (which are

synonymous) outweighs the previous good character, antecedents and

age of the offender, public interest must prevail. "

The maximum sentence for charge of statutory rape is 20 years. Imposing 12

years for each charge and ordering them to run consecutively to a period of

36 years for three statutory rape charges is not appropriate in this case.

The Appellant pleaded guilty to the indictment, thus saved valuable time of

the court. Further, now the Appellant is 58 years old and a married person

with two children. The victim also settled and having a good family life.

Considering all the factors into consideration, I think this is an appropriate

case to order the sentence imposed to run concurrently. Therefore, I order

the 12 years of rigorous imprisonment for each count to run concurrently.

Fines, compensation and default sentence imposed on the Appellant shall

remain same.

Considering the fact that the Appellant is in remand from the date of

conviction, I, order the sentence imposed on the Appellant be operative from

the date of sentence namely, 16.02.2023.

Therefore, the conviction is affirmed and the sentence is varied up to that

extent. The Appeal is partly allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Hambantota along with the original case record.
