M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an application by restitutio in integrum under article 138 of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Citihealth Imports (Private) Limited (hereinafter sometimes will be referred as the 1st

Petitioner) is challenging the decision of the learned High Court Judge dated 19th of January

Page 4 of 10

2024 in the case of CHC 18/2023/IP. Accordingly, the Petitioner has prayed for the

following.

I. Issue Notice of this Application on the Respondents;

II. Grant an Order revoking and/or revising and/or setting aside and/or annulling

the impugned Interim Injunction Order of the Learned Judge of Commercial High

Court marked 'X1' dated 19th January 2024;

III. Grant the Interim Injunction in prayer (h) of the Plaint marked 'X2' dated 16th

June 2023 in case No. HC (Civil) 18/23/IP restraining and/or preventing the

Defendant-Respondents and/or its servants and/or agents and/or employees either

directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever from interfering with the

Petitioners' use of the "Drools' trade mark/trade name in Sri Lanka including in

any manner interfering with the 1 Petitioner's registration with the Department of

Animal Production and Health;

IV. Grant the Interim Injunction in prayer (i) of the Plaint marked 'X2' dated 16th

June 2023 in case No. HC (Civil) 18/23/IP restraining and/or preventing the

Defendant-Respondents and/or its servants and/or agents and/or employees either

directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever from using the identical name of

the 2nd Petitioner or any combination of the words constituting the 2nd

Petitioner's trade name i.e. 'Drools Lanka (Citihealth) (Private) Limited';

V. Grant an Interim Order against the 1st and 2nd Defendant-Respondents to

maintain the status quo which prevailed as at 18th January 2024 as and when the

Enjoining Order was operational and invalidate/suspend any decisions that have

been already effected to alter such status quo until this matter is supported and/or

determined finally;

VI. Grant Costs;

VII. Grant such other and further reliefs as to Your Lordships' Court shall seem meet

The 1st Petitioner is a company engaging in importation of Drools brand pet foods from the

Abis Exports (India) Private Limited (Hereinafter sometimes will be referred to as the 2nd

Respondent) in India. The Drools Lanka (Citihealth)(Private) Limited is a subsidiary of the

1st Petitioner. The Drools Pet Food Private Ltd (hereinafter sometimes will be referred to as

the 1st Respondent ) engages in manufacturing and exporting pet foods. The Respondents are

a part of IB Group engaged in Protein Production business.

Page 5 of 10

The 1st Petitioner has been importing pet foods under the brand name Drools initially from

the 2nd Respondent and subsequently from the 1st Respondent. There was a prominent sticker

affixed in the packages of these products which identified the 1st Petitioner to be the company

who marketed and distributed the said product in Sri Lanka. The sticker used by the

Petitioner carries the mark of approved animal feed. The Petitioner has obtained the required

license from the Department of Animal Production and Health in terms of Animal Feed Act

No.15 of 1986.

The Petitioners states that the Respondent had voluntarily supported the Petitioners in their

brand building activities. The 2nd Petitioner has been incorporated in order to expand the

business activities of the 1st Petitioner. There was no written agreement between the 1st

Petitioner and the Respondents in respect of the intellectual property rights related to the said

trademark Drools. The Respondents had no direct physical presence in Sri Lanka and all

the intellectual property rights in respect of Drools trademark have been accrued to the

Petitioner by use. Accordingly, on or around 17th of May 2023, the 1st Respondent has

informed the 1st Petitioner about its decision to terminate the distributorship with the 1st

Petitioner.

It is the contention of the Respondents that the trademark Drools is owned by the 1st

Respondent, and it has been registered in the name of the 2nd Respondent in India in 2010.

Upon the proposal made by the 1st Petitioner the Respondents have agreed to allow 1st

Petitioner to import the Drools product in Sri Lanka and sell the products at a marked-up-

price. According to the proposed agreement on 1st of January 2020, the 1st Respondent has

agreed to supply the Drool product to the 1st Petitioner. Further, the Draft Exclusive

distribution agreement between the parties clearly mentions the 1st Petitioner to be the

distributor of the product under the brand name Drools within the territory of Sri Lanka.

However, there has not been any agreement relating to the intellectual property rights

between the Petitioner and the Respondents.

Accordingly, an enjoining order was sought by the Petitioners in the Commercial High Court

of Colombo to restrain the Respondents from interfering with the Petitioners use of Drools

trademark/trade name in Sri Lanka and restrain the Respondents from using the identical

name of the 2nd Petitioner or any combination of words constituting the 2nd Petitioners trade

name. Having considered the arguments of the Petitioners, the learned High Court Judge of

Page 6 of 10

Colombo has granted the enjoining orders sought which were effective from 21st of June

2023 to 5th of July 2023. However, after the inquiry by written submission, the learned High

Court Judge has set aside the enjoining orders issued on 21st of June 2023 and the application

for the interim injunction has been dismissed with a cost. Being aggrieved by the said order

the Petitioner has made an application for restituio in integrum and / Revision in terms of

Article 138 of the constitution.

The impugned order dated 19th of January 2024 by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

is related only to the interim relief sought by the Petitioner and the main matter is still

pending in the High Court.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that the learned High Court Judge in his order dated 19th

of January 2024 has failed to consider the necessary provisions of law under the Intellectual

Property Act No 36 of 2003. However, since the application has been made by the Petitioner

against the dismissal of the Interim Relief and the enjoining order sought in the plaint, I will

be focusing on this aspect.

The initial application in the High Court was instituted by the Petitioners to protect the

trademark and / trade name Drools to be not interrupted by the Respondents. Accordingly,

the Petitioner has sought the following reliefs,

(j)An enjoining order restraining and/ or preventing the Defendants and/or its

servants and/or agents and/or employees either directly or indirectly in any manner

whatsoever from interfering with the Plaintiffs use of the "Drools" trademark/

tradename in Sri Lanka in any manner interfering with the 1st Plaintiff's registration

with the Department of Animal Products and Health;

(k) An enjoining order restraining and/ or preventing the Defendants and/or its

servants and/or agents and/or employees either directly or indirectly in any manner

whatsoever from using the identical name of the 2nd Plaintiff or any combination of

the words constituting the 2nd Plaintiff's tradename ie. "Drools Lanka (Citihealth)

(Private) Ltd."

The following injunctive reliefs were also granted by the Commercial High Court of

Colombo on 21st of June 2023 which was subsequently set aside by the order dated 19th of

Page 7 of 10

January 2024. It is the view of the learned High Court Judge that the declarative reliefs

sought by the Petitioner, if granted, will not have any positive right to the Petitioner.

Further, the learned High Court Judge has also considered that the Petitioners have failed to

adduce any instance where the Petitioner had used the Drools trademark without the

consent of the Respondent while the distribution agreement is in existence. Moreover, the

draft agreement between the parties contains an indemnification clause where the Respondent

has agreed to indemnify the 1st Petitioner for any loss or damage suffered due to any claim by

a third party based on intellectual Property. Therefore, this clause does not suggest that the 1st

Petitioner has carried out business activities independently. The 1st Petitioner has taken steps

to incorporate the 2nd Petitioner to obtain enjoining order only after the Respondent has

terminated their distributor agreement. Therefore, by considering the circumstances, the

learned High Court judge has set aside the enjoining orders and dismissed the interim relief.

The test to be applied in an application for an interim injunction is set out in the landmark

judgment of Felix Dias Bandaranayake Vs. the State Film Corporation (1981) 2 SLR 287

Soza J. held,

In deciding whether or not to grant an interim injunction the following sequential

tests should be applied

1. Has the plaintiff made out a strong prima facie case of infringement or imminent

infringement of a legal right to which he has title, that is, that there is a serious

question to be tried in relation to his legal rights and that the probabilities are that he

will win.

2. In whose favour is the balance of convenience the main factor being the

uncompensatable disadvantage or irreparable damage to either party

3. As the injunction is an equitable relief granted in the discretion of the Court do the

conduct and dealings of the parties justify grant of the injunction. The material on

which the Court should act as the affidavits supplied by plaintiff and defendant. Oral

evidence can be led only of consent or upon acquiescence.

Page 8 of 10

The first step requires the Petitioner to have a strong prima facie case of infringement or an

imminent infringement of a legal right to which he has title. Accordingly, in the present

matter the learned High Court Judge has come to the view that the legal rights of the

Petitioner is not violated by the Respondent on the basis that the trademark Drools is

owned by the 1st Respondent which has been duly registered in the name of 2nd Respondent in

India and an application has been already made to the Intellectual Property office in Sri

Lanka to get the trademark registered in Sri Lanka which is still pending. It is the contention

of the Respondents that the product manufactured in the name of Drools is sold to the

Petitioner on a principal-to-principal basis which is resold by the Petitioner in Sri Lanka.

Further, it is the Respondents who have introduced the 1st Petitioner to their Customers as

importers and distributors and have authorized to distribute the said product within Sri Lanka.

Moreover, the promotional activities done by the 1st Petitioner with the approval of the

Respondents who have provided the artwork and the intellectual property to be displayed in

those promotions. Moreover, Respondent has reimbursed the 1st Petitioner for all the

promotional activities taken place in Sri Lanka, other than those where the parties have

agreed to share the cost. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge has decided that the

Petitioners have failed to establish a strong prima facie case of infringement or any imminent

threat to their legal rights.

The second limb requires the court to assess which party would suffer greater

uncompensatable disadvantage or irreparable damage if the injunction is granted or denied.

Accordingly, the petitioners have failed to demonstrate any irreparable harm or

uncompensatable disadvantage that would result from denying the injunction. Further, the

learned High Court Judge has also considered the fact that the Respondents had already

terminated the distributorship agreement, and there was no evidence that granting an

injunction would restore any substantive rights to the Petitioners. Further, none of the relief

sought were in favor of the 1st Petitioner.

As an equitable relief, an injunction requires that the conduct and dealings of the parties

justify its grant. Therefore, the third limb requires the court to consider the conduct of the

parties in granting relief. Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge has noted that the 1st

Petitioner has incorporated a second entity (2nd Petitioner) and sought enjoining orders only

after their distributorship agreement was terminated. Further, the indemnification clause in

Page 9 of 10

the Draft Exclusive distribution agreement indicates that the Petitioners were not acting

independently but rather as authorized distributors.

Considering the circumstances of the case, the learned High Court Judge had concluded that

none of the declaratory reliefs, injunctive reliefs sought by the Petitioners would confer any

positive rights upon them. Additionally, there was no evidence adduced by the Petitioner that

their legal rights had been violated or were at imminent risk of violation by the Respondent.

Moreover, as established in the case of Gamage V. the Minister of Agriculture and Lands

76 NLR 25; if the probability is that no right of the Petitioner will be violated or that he will

suffer no wrongs such as the law recognizes then the injunction will not be granted.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge has set aside the enjoining orders and dismissed the

interim injunction.

In the case of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Limited Vs. Wijewardena and others S.C.

Appeal 81/2010, Suresh Chandra, J. held;

By the enactment of Act No 10 of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter dealt within

the High Court, the right of appeal lies only to the Supreme Court. This seems to be

the clear intention of the legislature with regard to the matters dealt in the High

Court. When the above special provisions are being considered in the High Court, if

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is given then it would give the party

applying for revision in a situation as in the present case a favorable position by

granting an additional opportunity to review as against a party who comes within the

purview of the of the civil jurisdiction of the High Court regarding other matters as

they will be entitled only to the right of appeal to the Supreme Court. This would be

due to the fact that if the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is allowed

then, if need be, the party would have the option go further to the Supreme Court by

way of canvassing the judgment of the Court of Appeal in such instances. This would

give the party in such circumstances two opportunities of review of the preliminary

judgment when the clear intention of the legislature is that there should be only an

appeal Page 9 of 9 to the Supreme Court from any judgment or order of the High

Court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction in terms of sections 5(1) and 5(2).

According to the law, when an individual is aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the

right to appeal the decision is to the Supreme Court by way of a leave to appeal. However,

Page 10 of 10

the Petitioner has failed to exhaust the ordinary remedy available and has made an application

under Article 138 of the constitution of Sri Lanka in terms of restitutio in integrum and/or

revision. An application under restitutio requires the court to look into the exceptional

circumstances of the case or of that which shall shock the conscious of the court. However, in

the present matter, the Petitioner has failed to establish any such exceptional circumstances to

invoke this courts Jurisdiction.

Therefore, I find no basis interfering with the order dated 19th of January 2024 by the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo.

Therefore, this application is dismissed with a cost of Rs.100,000.
