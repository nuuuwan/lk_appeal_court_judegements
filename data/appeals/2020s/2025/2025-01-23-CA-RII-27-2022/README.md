In this matter, the Respondent-Petitioner, B.M. Tudor Nishantha (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Petitioner) is challenging the order made by the Magistrate of the Bandarawela in the

case No. 99847 dated 8th of October 2019. Accordingly, the Petitioner has prayed for the

following.

I. Issue notice on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents on this petition of Restitutio in integrum in

the first instance.

II. Grant a stay order under and in terms of rule 2(1) of the Supreme Court rules preventing

the proceedings of the Bandarawela Magistrate Court case No. 99847 for a period of 14

days or any period of time or until the final determination, of this case at the discretion of

the court.

III. Grant a judgment ordering the Magistrate Court of Bandarawela to issue a commission to

ascertain the boundaries and extent of and situation of lands more fully described in the

First and second schedules of the petition at the expense of the Petitioner.

IV. Grant a Judgment on the legal concept of Restitutio in integrum to set aside the order

P2A dated 8.10.2019 and P4A order dated 20.12.2022 declaring that P2A and P4A have

no bearing on the land more fully described in the 1st schedule of the petition.

V. Grant a judgment against the 2nd Respondent and 3rd Respondent declaring that the 2nd

Respondent has no authority to evict the Petitioner from the land more fully described in

the 1st schedule here to below based on P2A, the order of the learned Magistrate of

Bandarawela dated 8.10.2019.

VI. Grant a judgment that the Petitioner has been wronged by process of law and therefore

has a legal right to rectify the miscarriage, and failure of justice caused to him by the

orders of the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela, etc.

The tea estate Demodara Group was initially acquired by the Land Reform Commission (LRC).

The minister of agricultural development has vested the Demodare group with Janatha Estate

Development Board (JEDB) by the Gazette no.183/10 on the 12th of March 1982. The JEDB has

leased the said Demodara Estate to Hapugastenna Plantation Ltd by deed of lease No.143 dated

21st of September 1993 for 99 years. Subsequently, the terms of the deed of lease were amended

to reduce the period to 53 years from 11th June 1992 to 10th June 2045.

Page 4 of 7

The 1st Respondent on or around the 20th of September 2018 filed an application under and in

terms of the provisions of the State Land Recovery of Possession Act No.7 of 1979 as amended,

in the Bandarawela Magistrate Court against the Petitioner to obtain an eviction order to evict the

Petitioner from the land described in the original application before the Magistrate of

Bandarawela in the case No. 99847, based on the opinion that the land mentioned is a state land.

Subsequently, the Petitioner has filed a show cause in the Magistrate Court of Bandarawela and

both the parties have filed the written submissions respectfully. Accordingly, the learned

Magistrate of Bandarawela has ordered to evict the Petitioner from the said land on the 8th of

October 2019. Aggrieved by the order, the Petitioner had filed a revision application against the

1st Respondent in the Badulla Provincial High Court of Uva Province, related to the order of the

Bandarawela Magistrate court dated 8th of October 2019.

The Petitioner has withdrawn the Badulla High Court case on the ground that the order of the

Magistrate court of Bandarawela has no bearing on the land described in the first schedule of the

Petition. Therefore, the eviction order made by the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela on the 8th

of October 2019 stands proper now. On 1st of December 2022, the 1st Respondent

(Registrar/Deputy Fiscal) of Bandarawela Magistrate court executed the eviction order of the

learned Magistrate of Bandarawela, on the land described in the first schedule. The Petitioner

was informed to remove all the belongings within one week and hand over the premises to the

relevant authority.

Consequently, the Petitioner has filed a motion in the Magistrate Court of Bandarawela,

requesting the learned Magistrate to enlighten on the issue related to the execution of the eviction

order on the land described in the first schedule of the Petition. Accordingly, the Petitioner was

requested by the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela to file a fresh motion and notice to be issued

to the 1st Respondent and recorded that no order was made on the 13th of December 2022.

In the meanwhile, the 1st Respondent filed a motion on the 20th of December 2022 and has

moved the court to execute the eviction order on the land mentioned in the first schedule, which

the court has allowed. Aggrieved by the said order dated 20th of December 2022, the Petitioner

has filed the present application in this court alleging exceptional circumstances.

The 1st Respondent issued a quit notice on 16th of May 2018 against the Petitioner and

subsequently sought an eviction order which was issued by the learned Magistrate of

Page 5 of 7

Bandarawela on the land situated in the field No.2B of the sauthem division of Demodara

Estate, Demodara Yatikidha, Kubalwela Korale in Badulla District of Uva Province, containing

an extend of the land of three Rood Twenty Perches (Acres 00 Rood 03 Perches 20.0).

Respecting the eviction order by the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela, the 2nd Respondent

exercised the eviction order on the 1st of December 2022, which was supposedly to be the land

possessed by the Petitioner.

Therefore, this leads us to two possibilities regarding the land in question.

First possibility: The 1st Respondent may be referring to a different plot of land than the

Petitioner, as the 1st Respondent's initial application mentions the land in the second Schedule,

which is the field No.2B of the sauthem division of Demodara Estate, Demodara Yatikidha,

Kubalwela Korale in Badulla District of Uva Province (Acres 00 Rood 03 Perches 20.0) while

the Petitioner refers to the land in the first schedule of their Petition which is Demodara Estate

(South Division) situated at No.72 Gawarawela, Grama-niladari Division, Ella Pradeshiya saba

and divisional secretariat Division and Kubalwela Korale in the Badulla District of Uva

Province (Acres 00 Rood 1 Perches 13.75) as Lot 1 and containing an extend of the land of

within the same boundaries, ( Acres 00 Rood 00 Perches 20.0) as Lot 2. Therefore, it remains a

possibility that there are two different lands. If they are indeed not the same, then the Petitioner

cannot contest the order issued by the Learned Magistrate of Bandarawela.

Second possibility: The Petitioners land is entirely or partially included within the area claimed

by the 1st Respondent. This scenario leads to two further possibilities: if only a portion of the

Petitioner's land overlaps with that of the 1st Respondent, then only that overlapping section

should be returned to the 1st Respondent. However this has not been the case here. Conversely, if

the entire land claimed by the Petitioner falls within that claimed by the 1st Respondent, nothing

prevents the Respondent from reclaiming the possession of it. The reason being, that the

Petitioner alleged to have acquired the land on the Deed of Transfer No. 9204 on the 15th of

November 2018 executed by the Land Reform Commission. Nevertheless, the said land is

supposedly alienated and leased beforehand. Presently, the Demodara Estate was leased to the

Hapugastenna Plantation Ltd until 2054.

Page 6 of 7

As I have discussed before, the LRC has no right whatsoever to execute deeds on which the

Petitioner claims title. The rights of LRC already had been alienated before. Thus the deed No.

9204 would have no force in law and would become null & void.

This position is well explained in the case of Balangoda Plantation Ltd V. Janatha Estate

Development and Others 2019 3 SLR 525, Obeyesekere J. held that;

The Petitioner filed the application seeking a writ of prohibition restraining the

Land Reform Commission(LRC) from interfering in any manner with the Petitioners

lawful possession and occupation of any of the agricultural lands and estate lands

referred to in the lease agreement entered into by the petitioner and the 1st and 2nd

Respondent.

Held,

I. While an order made by the Minister under section 27 A(1) of the Land Reform

Law, No.1 of 1972, as amended, subsists, the LRC cannot exercise any power in

respect of lands which were vested with it in terms of section 42A of the Law.

II. The agricultural and estate lands referred to in orders of the Minister vested with

the 1st and 2nd Respondents together with all rights and liabilities of the LRC in

respect of such lands.

III. The LRC acted ultra vires when it executed leases after the said orders came into

effect.

Therefore, I am of the view that the LRC has transferred the said land to the Petitioner while the

lease between JEDB and Hapugastenna Plantation Ltd subsists. Thus, the LRC cannot exercise

any power over the land when the lease subsists. Moreover, it is apparent from the schedule

given by the Petitioner himself, that the land in the first schedule of the petition does constitute a

part of the Demodara Estate.

Furthermore, a case has to be decided as of the time it is filed. This application was filed by the

1st Respondent before the Magistrate court of Bandarawela on the 16th of May 2018, and the land

in the first schedule of the Petition was not owned by the Petitioner as of that date. Instead, it was

Page 7 of 7

subsequently owned by the Petitioner on the 11th of November 2018 as alleged. Therefore, the

order of the learned Magistrate of Bandarawela remains proper in law.

In the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. V. Shanmugam and Another (1995) 1

SLR 55, Ranaraja J. held as follows;

Relief by way of Restitutio-in-Integrum in respect of judgments of original courts may

be sought:

(a) where judgments have been obtained by fraud by the production of false evidence,

non-disclosure of material facts, or by force; or

(b) where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgments, which was unknown earlier to

the parties relying on it or which no diligence could have helped to disclose earlier, or

(c) where judgments have been pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon

provided, of course, it is an error which connotes a reasonable and "excusable error.

Accordingly, when applied to the facts before us, I do not see any reason to interfere with the

orders of the Learned Magistrate of Bandarawela. Further, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the

necessary threshold needed for invoking the jurisdiction of this court under Article 138(1) of the

Constitution. Therefore, the Court finds that there is no merit in the Petitioners application.

This application is dismissed with a cost of Rs. 50,000 payable by the Petitioner to the 1st

Respondent.
