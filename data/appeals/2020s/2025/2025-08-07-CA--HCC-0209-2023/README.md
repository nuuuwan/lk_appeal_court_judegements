JUDGEMENT

1. In this case, the appellant-accused (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Chilaw for committing rape on a girl under 16 years of age, an

offence falling under Section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code as amended by Act No 22 of

1995, and punishable under section 364(2) of the Penal Code.

2. The trial was conducted before the High Court Judge of Chilaw without a jury. At the

conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant guilty of the

charges and convicted him accordingly. The appellant was sentenced to 12 years of

rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 20,000/-, with a default sentence of two months of

simple imprisonment. Furthermore, the appellant was ordered to pay the prosecutrix a sum

of Rs. 500,000/- as compensation, failing which he will serve an additional eight months

of simple imprisonment.

3. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant has preferred the

present appeal. Although several grounds of appeal were advanced by the appellant, during

the argument, counsel for the appellant informed the Court that he would rely on the

grounds mentioned in his written submissions filed in support of the appeal.

4. In the written submissions, the appellant primarily relied on three grounds of appeal

namely:

a. The story of the prosecutrix is highly improbable, suspicious and contradictory and it

was not corroborated by other witnesses, and therefore the learned Hogh Court Judge

should not have acted on the evidence of the prosecutrix;

b. The prosecution has failed to place before the court a vital witness Senanayake

Arachchige Mily Charlet PW2 and thereby should have held in favor of the appellant

as per the presumption under section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance; and,

c. The learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the contradictions and

omissions marked on behalf of the appellant at the trial and/or duly consider the same.

CA/HCC/0209/2023

5. First, I shall consider the credibility of the prosecutrixs evidence and in particular, whether

there are any glaring contradictions which would render her testimony untrustworthy.

6. It was the argument of the appellant that the trial judge has failed to apply the test of

probability and improbability in its proper perspective to the evidence of PW-01 the

prosecutrix. In other words, that the trial judge failed to appreciate the improbability of the

victims story.

7. The credibility of a witness may be questioned by applying the test of probability and

improbability, consistency and inconsistency, interestedness and disinterestedness and

spontaneity and belatedness (Wickramasuriya vs. Dedoleena and others-(1996) 2 Sri LR

954).

8. In Veerasamy Sivathasan v Hon Attorney General, SC Appeal 208/2012, Justice

Yasantha Kodagoda has stated the following:

In a criminal trial conducted before a judge sitting without a jury, testimony and evidence

related functions to be performed by the presiding judge, which I wish to refer to as the

primary functions of the trial judge to be performed after the recording of evidence, are

the following:

1. Assessment and determination of 'credibility' of witnesses.

2. Determination of 'testimonial trustworthiness' of the testimonies given by witnesses.

3. Analysis of the evidence.

4. Determination of the 'probative value' (weight) to be attached to evidence and the

'sufficiency' of evidence to prove the charges.

5. Determination of whether the prosecution has 'proven the ingredients of the offence(s)'

the accused stands charged.

6. If the defence has relied on a 'general or special exception to criminal liability', whether

the defence has proven such exception.

7. Determination of whether the prosecution has proven its case 'beyond reasonable

doubt', and contra wise, whether the defence has raised a 'reasonable doubt' regarding

the case for the prosecution.

9. In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167 at 176

following the Privy Council case of Jayasena Vs. The Queen 72 NLR 313 (PC) it was

observed;

"A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider all

the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence

in its totality, without compartmentalizing and, ask himself whether as a prudent

man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused guilty of

the charge or not guilty."

10. With these legal principles in mind, I shall now consider the present appeal. According to

the prosecutrix's evidence, she was living with her maternal grandmother when she was

allegedly raped by the Appellant, who was her grandmother's second husband.

11. The house evidently had only one room. The prosecutrix, her younger brother,

grandmother, and the Appellant were the other occupants, all sleeping on a mat placed on

the floor. In her evidence-in-chief, the prosecutrix stated that the Appellant had raped her

on three occasions, with the last incident occurring three days before the complaint was

made to the police.

12. According to the prosecutrix's testimony, the alleged rape occurred while she was sleeping

alongside her grandmother and younger brother on a single mat on the floor. In her

evidence-in-chief, the prosecutrix explicitly stated that the Appellant turned on the light

and approached her as they slept; upon her cries, he extinguished the light and departed.

13. She testified as follows; (page No. 72)

14. What's discernible from the prosecutrix's evidence is that whenever the Appellant

approached her, she cried out, and her grandmother, whom she called 'Loku Amma,' would

awaken. However, the grandmother was not informed of the Appellant's alleged attempts

to rape the prosecutrix. The evidence also shows that after the prosecutrix's cries awakened

her grandmother; the Appellant later approached and raped her. Furthermore, she testified

as follows (page No. 75):

15. More importantly, the prosecutrix admitted to assaulting the Appellant, demanding him to

stop harassing her, after which he departed. Additionally, evidence shows the Appellant

raped the prosecutrix on three or four occasions; however, she did not report these

incidents to anyone, fearing he would assault or harm them.

16. However, in her testimony, she admitted that she raised an alarm and also assaulted the

Appellant on one or two occasions, which caused the Appellant to leave the room. If that

were the case, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept the prosecutrix's claim that she did

not inform anyone about the incident due to fear of the Appellant.

17. Therefore, it is not reasonable to believe that the Appellant would have committed rape on

the prosecutrix while the lights were on and in a room where her grandmother and younger

brother were sleeping on the same mat. At page 94, she testified as follows;

18. It is also important to examine the testimony of Dr. Y.M. Ilangarathna Banda, the Judicial

Medical Officer before whom the prosecutrix was produced and medically examined. The

Medico-Legal Report relating to the examination, bearing No. 51/13 and dated 15.09.2013,

was marked as P2. While referring to the report, the JMO expressed his observations and

stated the conclusions he had reached based on those observations.

19. A careful examination of the Medico-Legal Report reveals that the JMO observed old,

healed hymenal tears at the 6 oclock position, along with a dilated hymenal orifice that

could admit three fingers in an un-dilated state. Based on these findings, the JMO

concluded that there was medical evidence of repeated vaginal penetration over a period

of time. More importantly, the JMO observed old, healed tears on the hymen, which

appeared to be significantly worn out due to repeated vaginal penetration.

CA/HCC/0209/2023

20. It is also significant to note that, while giving evidence, the prosecutrix clearly stated that

the alleged incident occurred three days before she went to the police, and that nothing of

that nature had happened to her prior to that. She further testified as follows;

21. This evidence clearly contradicts the JMOs opinion, as the JMO concluded that there had

been repeated vaginal penetration occurring over a considerable period of time.

22. Therefore, the credibility of the prosecutrixs evidence in this regard is seriously

undermined by the medical opinion expressed by the JMO. Furthermore, her claim that

CA/HCC/0209/2023

9 | P a g e

she was raped by the appellant while lying on the same mat where her grandmother and

younger brother were also sleeping, with the lights on, is difficult to accept. According to

her own testimony, she cried out and even assaulted the appellant on one occasion. If, as

she stated, the appellant turned on the lights before approaching her and switched them off

when she resisted and raised cries, can it be reasonably believed that the others sleeping

on the same mat would not have awakened or been alarmed? The answer, quite clearly, is

no.

23. It is important to emphasize that, in a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness

and credibility of the prosecutrixparticularly the probability of her version of events

must be assessed by the trial judge with the utmost care and caution.

24. In Ranjeet Kumar Ram vs State of Bihar [2015] SCC 500, it was held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear in mind

while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the witness must be a reliable

one.

25. In State of Andra Pradesh vs Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC 1588, it was held

that:

..the courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an accused on a

charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity.

26. The aforementioned discrepancies and contradictions in the testimony of the prosecutrix

create a reasonable doubt regarding her version of eventsparticularly concerning the

manner in which she was allegedly raped by the appellant. Her evidence lacks consistency;

on one occasion, she stated that the appellant had raped her three times prior to the last

incident, while at another point, she claimed that the only instance of rape occurred three

days before she made the statement to the police. It will be relevant to discuss, at this

juncture, what is meant by reasonable doubt

27. In Goverdhan & Anr. Vs State of Chhattisgarh Criminal Appeal No. 116 OF 2011

decided on January 09, 2025, Indian Supreme Court elaborately discussed the concept of

reasonable doubt and stated as follows. It means that such doubt must be free from

suppositional speculation. It must not be the result of minute emotional detailing, and the

CA/HCC/0209/2023

10 | P a g e

doubt must be actual and substantial and not merely vague apprehension. A reasonable

doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt, but a fair doubt based upon

reason and common sense as observed in Ramakant Rai v. Madan Rai, (2003) 12 SCC 395

wherein it was observed as under : Doubts would be called reasonable if they are free

from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any favourite other than the truth.

To constitute reasonable doubt, it must be free from an overly emotional response. Doubts

must be actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from

the evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions. A reasonable

doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely possible doubt; but a fair doubt based upon

reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in the case.

28. While applying this principle of proof beyond reasonable doubt the Court has to

undertake a candid consideration of all the evidence in a fair and reasonable manner as

observed by the Supreme Court of India in State of Haryana v. Bhagirath (1999) 5 SCC

96 as follows:

It is nearly impossible in any criminal trial to prove all the elements with a

scientific precision. A criminal court could be convinced of the guilt only beyond

the range of a reasonable doubt. Of course, the expression reasonable doubt is

incapable of definition. Modern thinking is in favour of the view that proof beyond

a reasonable doubt is the same as proof which affords moral certainty to the Judge.

29. At this point, it may be also relevant to mention an observation made by Lord Denning, J.

in Miller v. Miller of Pensions (1947) 2 All ER 372, 373 H:

That degree is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high

degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted

fanciful possibilities to deflect the court of justice.

30. In the present case, there are notable inconsistencies and improbabilities, particularly

concerning the manner and place in which the appellant allegedly committed the offence.

Moreover, the prosecutrixs testimony was inconsistent regarding the number of times she

was allegedly raped, creating further uncertainty. These defects go to the very root of the

prosecution's case and seriously undermine the credibility of the prosecutrixs evidence.

Given the gravity of the charges levelled against the appellant, such inconsistencies cannot

be lightly disregarded.

CA/HCC/0209/2023

11 | P a g e

31. The prosecutrix was a 14-year-old child at the time of the alleged offence, and therefore,

it would be unreasonable to expect her to make a statement to the police entirely free of

shortcomings. Accordingly, I am not inclined to place significant weight on the

contradictions and omissions highlighted by the defence during cross-examination with

reference to her initial statement made to the police.

32. However, the improbabilities and inconsistencies evident in her testimony at the trial

cannot be lightly disregarded, particularly as she was a 21-year-old married woman with

a child when she gave evidence before the Court. Therefore, in assessing the credibility of

her testimonyespecially with regard to issues of improbabilitythe Court cannot apply

the same standard as it would for a child witness. The learned High Court Judge has taken

into account the age of the victim at the time of the alleged offence and has given reasons

for rejecting the defence's contention that the prosecutrixs credibility was impaired by the

contradictions in her evidence.

33. As stated earlier, the central issue in this case is not merely the contradictions highlighted

by the defence, but rather the inherent improbability of the prosecutrixs account of how

the alleged rape occurred, along with the inconsistencies evident in her testimony.

Furthermore, the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer casts serious doubt on the

truthfulness of the prosecutrixs version. The learned trial judge failed to adequately

analyze and evaluate these critical aspects before arriving at the conclusion to convict the

appellant.

34. Another vital ground of appeal advanced by the appellant is the failure of the prosecution

to summon PW2, Mili Charlet the grandmother of the prosecutrix, to give evidence. It was

therefore submitted that the presumption under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance

should be drawn in favour of the appellant.

35. According to the prosecutrix, her grandmother was sleeping in the same room, on the same

mat, at the time the alleged rape was committed by the appellant. She further stated in her

evidence that, on one occasion, her grandmother was awakened when she cried out as the

appellant attempted to rape her. If that were the case, PW2 would be an essential witness

in the present trial, particularly in light of the inconsistencies and improbabilities apparent

in the prosecutrixs testimony.

36. In King vs Senevirathne 38 NLR 208, it was held:

CA/HCC/0209/2023

12 | P a g e

Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is

based must be called by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect of their

testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution

37. In the present case, PW2 could have been a vital witness capable of corroborating the

testimony of the prosecutrix, had she been called to give evidence. However, the

prosecution, without offering any apparent reason, failed to summon PW2 to testify.

38. In view of the prosecutrixs evidence being unclear and inconsistent on material points

and also contradicting the opinion of the Judicial Medical Officer as stated in the Medico-

Legal Reportit would not be safe to rely solely on her testimony in the absence of

corroboration.

39. For the reasons set out above, I allow the Appeal and proceed to quash the convictions and

sentences imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw.

Accordingly, the Appellant is acquitted from all the charges leveled against him.
