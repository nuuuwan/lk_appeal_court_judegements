JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner instituted this application by petition dated 02.06.2023 seeking inter alia a

writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents to register the name of the

Petitioner as the lawful leaseholder of the premises described in the Lease Agreement

Page 5 of 7

marked P1 and a writ of Prohibition against the 1st to 3rd Respondents preventing them from

registering the names of anyone or more of the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents as the lessees of

the premises described in the said Lease Agreement or part thereof without adhering to the

provisions of the Land development Ordinance.

The factual matrix of this case is as follows:

According to the document marked P1, the Lease Agreement concerned in this case was

granted under the State Land Ordinance No. 8 of 1947 to one D.M. Leelawathie for

commercial purposes.

Thereafter, on 11.01.2021, the said D.M. Leelawathie, the Petitioners mother had requested

the 3rd Respondent to nominate the Petitioner as the successor of the disputed premises, on

the basis that she is not capable to administer and/or develop and/or maintain the leasehold

right of the premises.

It should be noted that according to the petition, the Petitioner is not a legitimate child of the

said D.M. Leelawathie.

The Petitioner avers that subsequently, the Petitioners mother during her lifetime had given

the express consent to have the Petitioner nominated as the successor for the premises in

question by letter dated 19.02.2021 marked P2. The Petitioner states that the 5th, 6th and 7th

Respondents upon being aware of this fact, disputed the rights of the Petitioner to be

succeeded.

Since the other legitimate children of D.M. Leelawathie had disputed the granting of the

lease to the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent called the parties for an inquiry by letter dated

17.03.2021 to which D.M. Leelawathie participated and consented to have the Petitioner as

the successor.

The said D.M. Leelawathie died on 08.06.2021. Upon her demise, two inquiries were held by

the 3rd Respondent. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent also held an inquiry. Thereafter, by letter

dated 19.01.2023, the 3rd Respondent informed the Petitioner and the Respondents to resolve

the matter through legal proceedings.

In this context, the Petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter

alia a writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents to register the name of

the Petitioner as the lawful leaseholder of the premises described in the Lease Agreement

marked P1 and a writ of Prohibition against the 1st to 3rd Respondents preventing them from

registering the names of anyone or more of the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents as the lessees of

the premises described in the said Lease Agreement or part thereof without adhering to the

provisions of the Land development Ordinance.

According to the written submission of the 1st to 3rd Respondents, the said Leelawathie had

given the consent to transfer the Lease Agreement to the Petitioner. According to the

document marked 2R1 which reads as follows:

.

.

There is no special provision available in the State Land Ordinance like in the Land

Development Ordinance or in the Land Grants Act regarding the nomination.

According to the said letter marked 2R1, this is not a transfer of title, this is a lease where

title will not be transferred.

According to Section 11 of the State Lands Ordinance, if the licensee has failed to observe

any condition attached to the said permit, the government agent may cancel the permit and

eject the person from the premises.

Page 7 of 7

We are of the view that the Court should consider the intention and the willingness of the

said Leelawathie which was indicated in several instances to transfer the land to the

Petitioner.

According to the said letter marked 2R1, the consents of the other legal heirs are not material

if the original lessee has expressly given the consent.

Therefore, we issue a writ of Mandamus to the 1st to 3rd Respondents to register the Petitioner

as the lawful leaseholder of the premises in dispute.

No order for costs.
