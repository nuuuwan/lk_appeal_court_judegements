The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) were indicted before the

High Court of Colombo on the following charges,

thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 303 of the Penal Code read

with Section 490 of the Penal Code.

2. The 2nd Accused aided and abetted the 1st Accused to commit the 1st offence mentioned

above and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 102 read with

Section 303 of the Penal Code.

3. the 1st and the 2nd Accused with the intention of causing injuries to a Public Servant

namely: WPS 4055 Renuka while she was discharging her duties namely: acting as a

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence through 11 witnesses and marking P01-P06

productions and thereafter closed its case. The 1st Accused gave evidence from the witness box

and the 2nd Accused made a dock statement in their defence.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge, by judgement dated 28.10.2021,

acquitted both Accused in respect of Counts 1 and 2. However, both were found guilty on Count

3 and were accordingly sentenced to a fine of Rs. 25,000/- each, with a default term of six

months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the 1st and 2nd Accused

have preferred this appeal to this Court. The following grounds for appeal were urged by the

Accused in the written submission.

1. The Prosecution failed to establish that the person on whom the hurt was caused was a

Public Servant

2. The Prosecution has failed to establish that WPC 4035 Renuka was performing as a

decoy on a search warrant issued in MC Case Number 1831/2/2009.

3.

The Facts and Circumstances of the case are as follows;

According to PW 01, Buddika Prasad Balachandran received information on 25.11.2009 from

a private informant, and later an anonymous letter dated 04.12.2009, alleging that illegal

abortions were being performed at Randeniya Medical Center, Dematagoda. Initial surveillance

being inconclusive, Police Constable Chandana was deployed on 08.12.2009 and reported

suspicious activity. Based on a search warrant (No. B 1851/2/09), PW 01 initiated a decoy

operation assigning PW 04, WPS 4055 Renuka, to pose as a pregnant woman. PW 04 testified

that a fee of Rs. 20,000/- was charged, along with a scanned image of a fetus.

PW 04 and PW 06, WPC Nadeeka visited the premises, received token No. 2, and were ushered

into rooms on the ground. Inside, the first Accused was present along with an assistant. Then

the 1st Accused questioned the purpose of their visit and what procedure they wished to

undergo. Then the first Accused instructed the second Accused to take PW 04 to the 1st floor

and again made inquiries from PW 04. According to evidence of PW 04, she has stated the

reason for the abortion. After receiving instructions, she was given tablets and told she would

Page 4 of 7

experience pain, followed by insertion of a capsule into the anus and additional medication to

relieve the pain.

After obtaining the signatures of PW 04 and PW 06, the first accused instructed PW 06 to leave

the room. Then asked the witness to lie down and raise her skirt. Subsequently, he handed over

some tablets and handed her a glass of water. At that point, PW 04 revealed her Police identity.

In the resulting commotion, the first accused bit PW 04's left hand. When she attempted to

contact the team, the second accused snatched her phone. After PW 04 lost her grip, the first

accused managed to get all but one of the tablets. According to the evidence of PW 06, when

PW 04 screamed upon entering the room, she was seen holding onto both the first and second

accused.

PW 01 received a call summoning him to the Dematagoda premises, and found PW 04 with

bleeding injuries, along with 5 tablets from PW 04 and SI Edirisinghe, uncovered marked

currency notes from the 1st Accuseds leather bag and seven additional tablets were recovered

from the buildings third floor.

The main ground argued by the Accused was the absence of a search warrant in the possession

of PW 04 at the time of the incident, as the warrant was held by PW 03. Counsel for the Accused

contends that the Accused reacted out of fear upon the revelation of PW 04s police identity,

citing prevalent concerns about the impersonation of police officers during robberies. It is

further submitted that the Accused did not exhibit any resistance towards PW 01, who entered

the premises in police uniform.

Despite conflicting testimony from both Accused concerning the identity card that was

revealed, the Learned High Court Judge ruled that the search warrant was not necessary in this

instance, as PW 04 was acting as a decoy. The Learned High Court Judge concluded that the

conduct of both accused, following the disclosure of PW 04s identity, was executed with the

intent to inflict harm upon a public servant and untenable to convict them of the third charge,

which has proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

The primary argument presented by the Counsel for the Accused was that the testimony of PW

04 lacked corroboration from other evidence. This raises the question: Is there a legal

requirement for corroborating a decoys testimony?

Page 5 of 7

In The Law of Evidence, Volume 2, Book 2, page 653, E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy define

decoys and spies as follows:

Decoys are not accomplices. Thus, the evidence of a police officer, who pretended to be an

accomplice, does not require corroboration as in the case of an accomplice. The rule does not

apply to persons who have joined in, or even provoked the crime as police spies, or the police,

who have assented thereto. Though there is no rule for corroboration of the evidence of a decoy,

it should be examined with caution, and it is desirable not to convict on the sole evidence of a

decoy.

Beddewela v. Albert, 42 NLR 136 at page 139, Soertsz J held that;

I have examined most of these cases, and it seems clear that in nearly every one of them the

evidence of the decoy was rejected not merely because he was a decoy, but for some additional

reason, such as his bad character, his ill-will towards the accused, his unsatisfactory demeanour,

and things like that.

For instance, in Coldera v. Pedrick, there was evidence to show that there was a special reason

and a special motive for the decoy wishing to implicate the accused. It is true, Garvin J. indeed

said, " whether there was such a motive or not, there is the fact that he was a decoy". In

estimating the assistance that can be derived from that judgment, proper emphasis must be laid

on the words" in this case " in view of the fact that there was evidence of " special motive".

Further, he held that in Almeida v. Adiriya, Akbar J. rejected the evidence of the decoy not only

because he was a decoy but also because there were strong reasons in that case for suspecting

the bona fides of the prosecution. Moreover, he found that the decoy's and the Inspector's

version of the sale was unconvincing. All he said, by way of general observation on the

evidence of decoys, was that their " evidence should be examined with great care as interested

parties may on little inducement give the necessary touch to their evidence in order to secure a

conviction". That is, if I may say so, an unexceptionable observation.

This concept of evidence should be examined with great care, as considered by Justice

Sameerawickrame J in the case of Ariyarantne v. Food and Price Control Inspector, Galle,

74 NLR 19 at page 21, stating that;

The learned magistrate makes no mention of the fact that Gunasekera was not called as a

witness and states that the two prosecution witnesses, namely, Bamunuvitarane and the decoy,

corroborated one another and were consistent in their testimony. He has misdirected himself in

Page 6 of 7

thinking that there was corroboration of the decoy's evidence to be found in the evidence of

Bamunuvitarane. I think, however, that a decoy is on a different footing from an accomplice so

far as the rule of practice regarding corroboration is concerned, but that his evidence should,

however, be probed and examined with great care-vide Beddewela v. Albert.

We are also mindful to consider the evidence of the decoy, PW 04 in accordance with the

observation made by Wijayatilake, J, in the case of Wickremadasa v. The Food Price

Controller, 78 NLR 3 at page 4, held that;

"Although a decoy is on a different footing from an accomplice so far as the rule of practice

regarding corroboration is concerned, his evidence should, however, be probed and examined

with great care."

Adopting this principle, we have sought to examine the evidence, and we are inclined to agree

with the learned counsel for the 2nd accused appellant that the failure to produce the dairy, in

which the number of the note was recorded, throws a reasonable doubt in regard to the version

for the prosecution. We would accordingly give the benefit of such doubt to the 2nd accused

appellant and quash the conviction and sentence passed against him and acquit him."

With the above authority, we focus on the evidence of PW 04 and whether the evidence is

convincing. According to the PW 04, he has stated that when she showed the identity card

explained the reason for her visit, then both accused got frighted and held both their hands.

With the reserve she incurred, which was not disputed by the accused. Then the PW 04 showed

the injuries to the doctor, and the doctor confirmed the injury. According to PW 04, while they

held her hands, they were trying to take medicine from her. The PW 05 has stated that when

she entered the room, both Accused were holding the witnesss hand. The first Accused has

admitted that the fourth witness has identified him as a police officer. The Learned High Court

has correctly come to the conclusion that they have prevented her from performing her official

duty.

When we analyse the evidence in total, PW 04s evidence is convincing; she has established

that when the Accused identified herself as a police officer, they held her hand by preventing

her from performing her duty. We are satisfied with the above evidence that the Learned High

Court Judge has correctly examined the witness with great care. Therefore, there is no reason

for us to reject the findings of the Learned High Court Judge regarding the Evidence of PW04.

There is no reason for us to disagree with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge.

We hold that the prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt with regard to the third

count.

For the aforementioned reasons, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the

sentence.
