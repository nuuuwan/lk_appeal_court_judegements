ORDER

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. This is an application by the Complainant-Petitioner namely the

Director-General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of

the Constitution.

2. The petitioner is seeking to set aside an order made by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo on January 05, 2024 in High Court of Colombo

case no. HCB/ 179/2022, where the indictment forwarded by the

petitioner has been rejected and the accused discharged on a

preliminary objection raised on behalf of the accused-respondent

named in the instant application.

3. When the instant application was supported for notice, this Court after

having satisfied itself with regard to the submissions made on behalf of

the petitioner has decided to issue notice on the accused-respondents.

Accordingly, the accused-respondents were represented in Court and

were permitted to file objections.

4. Filing objections the accused-respondents have moved that the matter

be dismissed on the basis that the application of the petitioner had no

merit.

High Court case no. HCB/179/2022

5. The first accused-respondent has been indicted in the High Court of

Colombo on counts of corruption, offences punishable in terms of

section 70 of the Bribery Act No. 11 of 1954 (as amended). The

Page 4 of 10

aforementioned counts are alleged to have been committed by the first

accused-respondent while he was serving as the Director-General of the

National Rupavahini Corporation between the period of December

16,2024 and January 15,2015. The second accused-respondent has

been indicted on counts of abetting, offences punishable under section

102 of the Penal Code read together with section 70 of the Bribery Act

No. 11 of 1954 (as amended).

6. On January 10,2023, the accused-respondents have submitted written

objections to the High Court. One of the key objections raised is that the

accused-respondents have already been acquitted by the Magistrates

Court. They argue that the charges outlined in the charge sheet from

that case are identical to those in the indictment forwarded to the High

Court. Therefore, they contend that the proceedings in the High Court

cannot continue as long as the acquittal from the Magistrates Court

remains in effect and has not been overturned by a competent Court.

7. The Learned High Court Judge pronouncing the order on January

05,2024, has determined that the indictment cannot be sustained due

to the stated objection.

8. Accordingly, the accused-respondents, have been discharged.

Factual Background

9. Before considering the legality of the disputed order (i.e. order

discharging the accused-respondents from the High Court case no.

HCB/179/2022). I would now proceed to examine the factual

background which led to the accused-respondents being indicted in the

High Court of Colombo.

Page 5 of 10

10. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

(hereinafter referred to as the Commission) upon receipt of a

communication regarding allegation of bribery and corruption has

investigated such allegation and thereafter directed the Director-General

to institute criminal proceedings against the accused-respondents on

July 07,2017, before the Magistrates Court of Colombo by case no.

74173/01/17. The counts, the accused-respondents have been charged

for have been the same as those stated in the indictment forwarded to

the High Court of Colombo subsequently. When the matter was taken up

for trial in the Magistrates Court, PW01 has concluded his testimony,

when PW02 was giving evidence, the Learned Counsel of the accused-

respondents have raised an objection regarding the maintainability of the

case on the basis that the Commission had not collectively directed the

Director-General to institute proceedings against the accused-

respondents. The objections have been based on the judgment

pronounced by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the case of

Anoma Polwatta vs. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption, SC/Writ Application No. 01/2011.

11. The Learned Magistrate has overruled the objection. The accused-

respondents thereafter has preferred an application in revision to the

Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo seeking to

revise the order of the Learned Magistrate.

12. However, during the pendency of the revision application, the Director-

General after having considered the implications of the Supreme Court

judgment referred to above has decided to withdraw the case in the

Magistrates Court.

13. The Learned Magistrate has permitted the withdrawal of the case in the

Magistrates Court and has further determined that such application for

Page 6 of 10

withdrawal has been made in terms of section 189 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. Therewith, proceeded to acquit

the accused-respondents. The said order acquitting the accused-

respondents have been pronounced on July 27,2021. Subsequently, the

accused-respondents have submitted an application to withdraw the

revision application that had been forwarded to the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province holden in Colombo. The Court has granted the

application, allowing the withdrawal.

14. The Director-General has thereafter forwarded the indictment in

question to the High Court of Colombo on August 03,2022. There is no

dispute that the said indictment contains the same charges that have

been outlined in the charge sheet handed over to the accused-

respondents in the Magistrates Court.

Legal analysis

15. The maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa expresses

a great fundamental rule of criminal law, which forbids that a man

should be put in jeopardy twice for one and the same offence. It is the

foundation of the special pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict.

This rule of law has been enshrined in our legal system through the

provisions outlined in section 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

16. Section 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows;

(1) A person who has once been tried by a Court of competent

Jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or acquitted of such

offence shall while such conviction or acquittal remain in force not

be liable to be tried again for the same offence nor on the same

facts for any other offence for which a different charge from the one

made against him might have been made under section 176 or for

which he might have been convicted under section 177.

Page 7 of 10

17. When the instant application was taken up for argument, the Learned

Counsel for the petitioner has cited several legal interpretations as to the

word tried referred to in section 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act. She has also argued that the Learned High Court Judge erred in

properly considering the provisions in section 314 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act and has drawn the attention of this Court to the judgment

in the case of SC Appeal 12A/2009 decided on May 05,2011 to support

her argument.

18. It has been her position that although the Learned Magistrate has

acquitted the accused-respondents from the Magistrates Courts case,

that itself would not be a bar to the petitioner to indict the accused-

respondents and section 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was

not applicable.

19. The Learned Counsel for the accused-respondents argued that the

order pronounced by the Learned Magistrate constituted an acquittal

that has not been overturned by a competent Court. Consequently, this

acquittal remains a final verdict. He further argued that the provisions

laid out in section 314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act precluded

the petitioner from presenting an indictment against the accused-

respondents as long as the acquittal is still in effect.

20. E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in his book, The Law of Evidence [Volume-

I ] at page 543 cites Spencer Bower and Turner, op. cit., section 317, pp.

268-269, states as follows,

The plea of auterfois acquit is expressed in the maxim, nemo

debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa it is a species of estoppel

by which one party is precluded as against the other from asserting

Page 8 of 10

the contrary of what has been determined in previous proceedings

between them. But the plea of auterfois convict depends on nemo

debet bis puniri pro uno delicto it is strictly not a manifestation of

the doctrine of estoppel but is akin to merger. The rights of the

successful party having become merged in the judgment, the same

facts cannot be re-asserted in fresh proceedings.

21. In the case of SC Appeal No.12 A/2009 decided on May,05,2011,

Shiranee Thilakawardena, J, in considering the meaning of term tried

in the provisions in section 314 in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

has stated as follows;

The word tried, the operative word in this section, finds

meaning in section 5 and section 184 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act referred to above. Section 5 provides that all offences

(under the Penal Code or any other law) are to be (i) investigated

(ii) inquired into and (iii) tried and otherwise dealt in accordance

with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act referred

to above. The nature of these three phases of an allegation of an

offence in the context of a summary procedure is found in section

184 which stipulates that if a Magistrate proceeds to try the

accused, there is a mandatory obligation to take all such evidence

as is produced by the prosecution or defence the effect, then, of the

operative language of section 314(1) as informed by the above

mentioned sections is to make clear that if a person is to have been

considered tried for purposes of section 314, the opportunity for

both sides to produce some evidence to support their respective

stances has to have been available.

Given the earlier determination that acquittal under the proviso

require some level of evidentiary proceeding to have taken place,

Page 9 of 10

and that an opportunity for leading evidence is inherent to section

314 (1) definition tried, it necessarily follows that an acquittal

under the proviso of section 186 does not fall within the ambit of

section 314.

22. As stated earlier, during the proceedings in the Magistrates Court, an

objection has been raised by the accused-respondents regarding the

maintainability of the case. The objection has asserted that the

Commission has not collectively directed the institution of such

proceedings. In response to this objection, the Director-General has

decided to withdraw a case from the Magistrates Court. He has thereafter

on the direction of the Commission instituted proceedings against the

accused-respondents by forwarding an indictment based on the same

charges outlined in the charge sheet that had been presented to the

accused-respondents in the Magistrates Court.

23. The matters discussed above indicate that there has not been an

opportunity for either party involved in the Magistrates Court case to

present in full evidence that could support their respective positions. In

the situation referred to, such an opportunity was evidently absent.

Furthermore, the ability to present evidence is inherently tied to the

definition of tried outlined in section 314 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. Consequently, it logically follows that an acquittal such

as the one being considered does not fall within the scope of section 314

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

24. As articulated in section 314(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code

Act, the framework allows for the introduction of evidence as a crucial

component of the trial. The absence of such an opportunity implies that

Page 10 of 10

the acquittal cannot be categorised within the provisions of such section

as it inherently lacks the necessary evidential foundation that section

314 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act presupposes.

25. Therefore, it is my considered view that the Learned High Court Judge

was misdirected when he discharged the accused-respondents based on

the matters discussed in the disputed order.

26. Accordingly, I set aside the order dated January 05, 2024, of the High

Court of Colombo and dismiss the objection raised on behalf of the

accused-respondent as to the sustainability of the indictment/case

before the High Court of Colombo.

27. I direct the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo to restore the case

back to the Courts case roll and proceed with the case to its conclusion.

28. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this order to the

High Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
