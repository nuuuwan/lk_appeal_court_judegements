However, it is submitted that in two instances on page 4 of the Mortgage Bond P5, the value of Rs. 7,500,000/- has been deleted and replaced with Rs. 25,000,000/-, which had not been initialled by the Notary Public. Further, the amount of Rs. 7,500,000/-, which is referred to in the attestation of the Mortgage Bond P5, has also been altered as Rs. 25,000,000/-. The contention of the Petitioner is that he never executed a Mortgage Bond for Rs. 25,000,000/-, and such alterations have been effected subsequent to the registration of the Mortgage Bond P5 without the concurrence and/or agreement of the mortgagor.",

It is further submitted that the above publication P11 does not refer to the Mortgage Bond (No.2678) executed by M/S Chamathkara Industries (Pvt) Ltd, even though the purported Resolution P10 refers to the default payment made by the said entity. However, it is abundantly clear that this is a complete misconception as the Notice of Publication marked P11 also refers to all the Deeds referred to in the Board Resolution marked P10, including Deeds 4388 and 2678.",
