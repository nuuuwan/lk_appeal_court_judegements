However, the respondent agreed to reduce the monthly rental to Rs. 150,000/- for the months during the periods of curfew or travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, during the time of the economic crisis, though there were no such travel restrictions or curfews, the respondent agreed to reduce the monthly rental to Rs. 200,000/-.

The petitioner should have contested the validity of the decree nisi before the District Court in terms of Section 12 of the Act.
