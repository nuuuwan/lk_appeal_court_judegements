The petitioner also asserts that the corpus includes Sangika property belonging to the temple, as specified under the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance.

They deny the Petitioner's claim that notices were not served on Venerable Dhammaloka Thero, stating that several notices were issued and referenced in Document X2. They say that the Petitioner and his predecessor failed to present their case and clearly demonstrate the negligence. 6] I Now, consider the merits of this case. The Respondents have contended that the Petitioner is not a party to the partition case; thus, there is no availability of restitutio in integrum.

    "text": "Citing the judgment of Paulis Vs. Joseph and Others reported in 2005 (3) SLR 162 the learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent submitted that as the petitioners were not parties to the partition action the remedy of Restitutio - in - integrum is not available to the petitioners. The ratio decidendi in that case will not apply to this case. In that case the petitioner was a party to the action although she did not participate in the trial and following the judgement of Kusumawathi Vs. Wijesinghe 2001 (1) SLR 238 the Court of Appeal held that it had power to grant the relief of Restitutio - In - Integrum. However, it is settled law that an application for Restitutio - In - Integrum can only be filed by a party to a case (Perera Vs. Wijewickrama 15 NLR 411, Dissanayake Vs. Elisinahami 1978/79 - (2) SLR 118, Ranasinghe Vs. Gunasekara 2006 - (2) SLR 393, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd Vs. Shanmugam 1995 - (1) SLR SS). But this is not only an application for Restitutio - In - Integrum it is also an application for revision. In the caption of the application, it is stated thus \"In the matter of an Application for Revision or Restitutio integrum in terms of Article 138 and 145 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka ....... \" 7] In the case in hand, the application is sought as a revision or Restitutio integrum. Thus, we are of the view that the application is well within our jurisdiction and should be considered. 8] I now consider the other facts of the case. According to the plaint, the land sought to be partitioned is known as Pabalinawatta, said to be 2 acres (8 roods). The Preliminary Plan No. 699 depicted the land as only 3 roods and 38.84 perches. Thus, there is vast discrepancy in the extent of the land although,",
