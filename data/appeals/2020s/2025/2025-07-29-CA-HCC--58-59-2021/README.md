JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Negombo under Sections 54(A)(d) and 54(A)(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for being in

possession and trafficking (respectively) of 04.13 grams of Heroin on 10th

June 2013.

After the trial both the Appellants were found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Negombo has imposed life imprisonment for

both counts on 06th of August, 2021.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellants informed this Court that the Appellants had

given their consent to argue this matter in their absence. Hence, argument

was taken up in their absence but they were connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

Both Appellants had jointly raised a single ground of appeal contending that

the learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the vital

discrepancy with regard to the quantity of Heroin recovered from the

Appellants.

PW1, CI/Randeniya, was the Officer-in Charge at the Kandana Police

Station, when he conducted this raid. He had received an information about

an impending drug deal at a hotel named Sancharina, situated in the Wattala

police area, when he was attending a class conducted by the Superintendent

of Kelaniya Division. Following the instructions of his superior officers, he

had gone to the Wattala Police Station and organised a team to conduct the

raid. As per the information, the team had arrived at the hotel at about 13:00

hours. When PW1 and PW4 entered Room No.23, they had seen two persons

sitting on a bed busy packaging some product. After introducing himself to

the two persons, PW1 had checked the room and found 13 small polythene

bags with a small parcel in it. Out of 13, 10 parcels were fastened with a

knot and three were not so fastened. Upon further examination, each parcel

was seen to contain 40 small packets with some substances suspected to be

Heroin inside of them. In total, 520 packets were taken in to the custody by

the police during that raid. Both persons were arrested and brought to the

Wattala Police Station for further investigations. At the police station, the

substance contained in the packets were put on to a half sheet paper and

weighed using an electronic scale. The gross quantity of the substance

weighed about 16.100 grams. All productions had been properly sealed,

finger prints of the Appellants were obtained, and entered in the PR register

and handed over to the reserve police officer.

PW4 PC 48908 Sisira Kumara was called by the prosecution to corroborate

the evidence of PW1.

In their dock statements, the Appellants took up the position that they were

never in possession of any dangerous drugs as claimed by the prosecution.

They had been arrested while they were in a hotel in Wattala. According to

the 2nd Appellant, narcotics which had been recovered from persons whom

were in Room No. 22 were introduced on to them by the police.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

In trials of this nature, the prosecution does not only need to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt but should also ensure, with cogent evidence that

the inward journey of the production has not been disturbed at the all-

material points.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill

the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A

prosecutor should take pains to ensure that the chain of events

pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from the

CA-HCC 0058-059/2021

5 | P a g e

Appellant from the time it was taken into custody to the time it reaches

the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should be

established.

The Appellants take up the position that there is a significant discrepancy

between the weight of Heroin said to have been recovered from the Appellants

and the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the Appellants contend

that the learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by failing to analyse the

discrepancy of the weight of the substance allegedly recovered from the

Appellants which disturbs the production chain. He further submits that

this is a substantial fact, which the prosecution has to prove beyond a

reasonable doubt.

This ground of appeal directly relates to the evidence given by PW1 and PW4.

According to PW1, the recovered substance was weighed at the Wattala Police

Station in front of the Appellants. According to both PW1 and PW4 the

substance was weighed using a scale obtained from the police. The gross

aggregate weight of the substance was 16.100 grams.

When the productions were taken to the Government Analyst Department, a

notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to the Government

Analyst Report the weight of the parcel was mentioned as 8.64 grams. This

is 8.46 grams less than the original weight recorded by the police. Hence the

Appellant argues that the weight difference creates a serious doubt in the

prosecution case as the weight difference is quite significant.

When this Court invited the Respondent to explain the discrepancy regarding

the weight of the productions which transpired from the evidence, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General following the best traditions and highest

standard of the Attorney Generals Department admitted the weight

discrepancy in the production and further added that she is unable to

explain the reason.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will depend on that.

In the case of Koushappis v. The State of WA [2007] WASCA 26; (2007) 168

A Crim R 51 at para 85 the court held:

Whilst the safe custody of critical exhibits such as these ought to be

readily proved by clear and specific evidence rather than being left to

inference, having regard to the way the case was conducted on both

sides, the evidence here was such in my view, as to allow the jury to be

satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs that were analysed

were in fact those seized by police from the appellants house;

The afore-mentioned judgments clearly highlight the critical importance of

the evidence with regards to the chain of custody in drug-related offences.

They provide clear guidance on how this evidence should be presented to

satisfy the trial court. Each piece of evidence requires thorough analysis to

ascertain its origin and who had access to it, ensuring no deviations from

standard practice.

In cases regarding drug related offences, chain of custody issues is of critical

importance. The prosecution must present undisputable evidence to

establish the chain of custody of the exhibits. Additionally, they must prove

that the item presented at trial is the same item originally in the possession

of or taken from the accused. Relying on tainted, unreliable, or tampered

evidence would undermine the integrity of the judicial system.

In this regard, the learned High Court Judge had not made any comment

about the weight discrepancy in his judgment. This has caused great

prejudice to the Appellants by refusing them the right to a fair trial.

Further, although PW1 and PW2 had said that the finger prints of the

Appellants were taken to seal the production after weighing, at the trial it

CA-HCC 0058-059/2021

7 | P a g e

was revealed that one of the Appellants signatures was absent on the sealed

envelope, regardless of which the learned High Court Judge had arrived at

the conclusion that the production had been properly sealed in the presence

of the Appellants. This is a clear misdirection and had deprived the

Appellants a fair trial.

The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the inward journey

of the productions creates a serious doubt on the conviction against the

Appellants. Further, the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses

consists of contradictions and improbabilities.

Considering the ground of appeal discussed above, it clearly supports the

stance taken by the Appellants in defence as well as in the dock statement

and certainly affects the root of the case.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellants

by the learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 06/08/2021. Therefore,

they are acquitted from all charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High

Court of Negombo along with the original case record.
