The Petitioner states that the specific request for details of the COO's foreign travel expenses does not serve any larger public interest, as all such expenses are already disclosed in aggregate under Operating Costs in the publicly available financial statements. Disclosing individual expenses would amount to an unwarranted invasion of the COOs privacy and fall within the RTI Acts exemptions under Section 5(1)(a). The Petitioner emphasizes that its employees are contractually bound by confidentiality as per Article 116(5) of its Articles of Association, and the information requested relates to internal business decisions, not public activity. Therefore, the refusal of the request was justified under Sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(g) of the RTI Act. 10] I now consider the merits of this appeal. The Petitioner seeks protection under section 5(1)(a) and section 5(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016. Those sections are reproduced below for clarity.",
