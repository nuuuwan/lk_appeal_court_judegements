Case of the prosecution

5. The deceased named in the 3rd charge, Sunethra Kanthi is the wife of

the appellant. The deceased named in the 4th charge, Anoma Kanthi is

the sister of the appellants wife. The deceased named in the 5th charge,

Buddharalage Seelawathie is the mother of the appellants wife. Lastly,

the deceased named in the 6th charge, Manik Ralage Suraweera is the

brother-in-law of the sister of the appellants wife.

6. On 23.05.2007, the appellant has gone to his in-laws house to fetch

his wife. However, because the appellant was under the influence of

Page 7 of 23

alcohol, his wife has offered to return the next day. In that moment, the

appellant has become angry and threatened to kill everyone in that

household the next day before leaving.

7. Later that same day, around 10.30 pm, the appellant has gone to the

house of PW 01 armed with a T56 weapon. He has pointed the weapon

at PW 01, threatened to shoot him, and has taken away two loaded T56

magazines from PW 01.

8. In the early hours of the next day, when there was a light at the crack

of dawn, the appellant had returned to his in-laws house. Upon seeing

her husband with the T56 weapon the appellants wife has run toward

her sisters house and hid in the garden. The appellant has approached

her, grabbing her by the hair and tried to drag her away. At that

moment, the sister of the appellants wife and the brother-in-law of the

sister have intervened and warned the appellant. The appellant has

been warned against doing anything untoward to his wife, Sunethra

Kanthi. At that moment, the appellant has discharged his weapon at

the deceased as mentioned in charges 3. 4, 5 and 6. The deceased have

Page 8 of 23

suffered fatal gunshot wounds due to the shooting. PW 04 has also

sustained injuries to his leg during the incident.

9. Following the shooting, the appellant has escaped into the nearby

jungle and evaded capture until he was arrested by officers from the

Kabithigollawa Police Station.

10. Dr. S. B. Bopitiya, affiliated with the Kandy General Hospital, and Dr.

R. D. N. Wijekoon, a medical officer at the Kabithigollawa Rural Hospital,

have conducted the post-mortem examinations on the deceased. The

post-mortem reports have been marked .04, .05, .06 and .07.

Case of the appellant

11. The appellant has maintained that his intention to visit his in-laws

house was to fetch his wife. At that moment, a crowd has allegedly

gathered intent on assaulting him. In a bid to escape the imminent

danger, the appellant has discharged his firearm into the air to fend off

the attackers.

Page 9 of 23

12. Once the crowd dispersed, the situation has remained tensed. The

appellants wife, her sister along with the brother-in-law of the sister

(Suraweera) have chosen to stay with the appellant. Suraweera has

attempted to seize the firearm from the appellant escalating the already

volatile situation.

13. The initial gunfire has attracted the attention of nearby police officers

who were present for road clearance duty. In an unfortunate turn of

events, the officers have mistakenly discharged their weapons in the

direction of the appellant and the others present. The appellant has

then witnessed the horrifying moment when both his wife and her sister

were struck by police gunfire. Desperate and pleading for help, the

appellant has found himself in a precarious position. Fearing for his

safety, he has decided to withdraw into the nearby jungle, seeking

refuge from the chaos surrounding him.

Grounds of appeal

14. When the appeal was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal:

Page 10 of 23

i. That the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is

erroneous and bad in law.

ii. That the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected

himself and erred in law and in fact.

iii. That the prosecution has failed to prove the case and

discharge its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

iv. That the Learned High Court Judge has failed to examine

and evaluate the evidence placed before Court by the

prosecution in accordance with well settled principles of

criminal law.

v. That the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected

himself with regard to the evidence placed before Court

to establish the ingredients of the charges.

vi. That the Learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the prosecutions failure to establish beyond

reasonable doubt the evidence pertaining to the incident.

vii. That the Learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the material contradictions of the evidence

given by prosecution witnesses.

Page 11 of 23

viii. That the evidence placed before the Court by the

prosecution itself has created a reasonable doubt with

regard to the guilt of the accused.

ix. That the Learned High Court Judge has failed to give the

benefit of the doubt to the accused and thereby acted

contrary to well-established principles of criminal law.

15. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has argued that the appellant

had not instilled a fear of immediate death, injury or unlawful restraint

in PW 01 before taking away the two loaded T-56 magazines from the

latter. It is stated that this is evident from the invitation extended by

PW 01 to the appellant for a potluck gathering. Furthermore, the

Learned Counsel contends that the prosecution has relied solely on

interested witnesses. Despite having the opportunity to call

independent witnesses, that the prosecution has failed to do so.

Additionally, the witnesses presented by the prosecution have provided

inconsistent testimony. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has

drawn the attention of Court to several points in order to substantiate

Page 12 of 23

the claim that the witness presented by the prosecution have provided

inconsistent testimony.

Firstly, that it is notable that PW 01 has not mentioned in his statement

to the police that the appellant had threatened him with death if he

stepped outside the house during the incident involving the robbery. It

is argued that this omission raises questions about the credibility of his

account. Furthermore, although PW 01 has claimed that he

subsequently hid in the jungle, yet this detail is contradicted by his

earlier statements. Additionally, even though PW 01 has allegedly

informed four other individuals about the robbery involving two loaded

T56 magazines, but the context and specifics of these communications

remain unclear.

16. Moving on to PW 03, the Learned Counsel contends that it is

significant that his statement to the police did not include the detail

that the appellant allegedly visited his house for the second time around

midnight on the day before the incident involving the shooting of the

deceased and such discrepancy complicates the prosecutions

narrative. Moreover, while PW 03 has noted that his daughter, who is

Page 13 of 23

the wife of the appellant spent the night in the jungle to evade potential

harm, PW 04 has stated that his aunt stayed at her parents house that

night. This contradiction, it is contended further undermines the

reliability of the witness evidence.

17. Moving onto PW 04, the Learned Counsel contends that he has failed

to mention in his police statement that his mother, aunt and uncle were

lined up and shot by the appellant. It is urged that this lack of detail is

concerning and suggests inconsistencies in the testimonies presented

by prosecution witnesses.

18. As for PW 06, who is the husband of the sister of the appellants wife,

the Learned Counsel contends that he has testified that on the day prior

to the incident, the appellant had an argument with his father-in-law

at their home. However, in his statement to the police, PW 06 has

reported that an argument took place with both appellants parents-in-

law and his wife. It is argued that this highlights further inconsistencies

in the testimonies.

Page 14 of 23

19. Also the testimony of PW 06 during the examination indicated that he

has heard shots being fired while he was on his way to the Police Post

to report the appellant. However, in his statement to the police, he has

claimed that he heard the shots on his way back. This inconsistency, it

is argued, raises questions about the accuracy of PW 06s account.

Furthermore, PW 06 has contradicted himself regarding the manner of

his return, stating at one point that he returned on foot, at another that

he used a bus.

20. Additionally, PW 06 has further testified that he instructed his wife to

take their children to her mothers house. However, his police statement

contradicted this as he has stated that he directed her to go to her

sisters house.

21. These discrepancies, it is argued, undermine the reliability of PW 06s

testimony and call into question the validity of his observations and

actions during the incident.

Page 15 of 23

22. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has also contended that, given

the evidence that third parties were present at the scene of the crime

armed and discharged their weapons, it is incumbent upon the

prosecution to demonstrate that these shots did not cause the fatal

injuries sustained by the deceased.

23. The Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General in reply has maintained

that the prosecution witnesses have provided their evidence after a

lapse of nine years since the incident occurred. This lengthy delay gives

rise to crucial questions about the witnesses ability to accurately recall

events, as they may struggle to remember critical details. The natural

process of forgetting can lead to contradictions and omissions in their

testimony.

24. Furthermore, the Learned Senior Deputy Deputy Solicitor General has

highlighted that one particular witness i.e. PW 04 was only eight years

old at the time of the incident. That such a young age may impair a

childs capacity to remember and recount events with clarity. The

contradictions and omissions identified in witness testimony do not

fundamentally undermine the prosecutions case. He has further

Page 16 of 23

asserted that the core elements of the prosecutions argument remain

intact.

25. Additionally, the Learned Senior Solicitor General has also maintained

that the appellants claim that third parties were present at the scene

of the incident, armed and allegedly responsible for discharging

weapons that resulted in the fatal injuries to the deceased should be

called into question since such an assertion was not brought up during

the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses. Also, the fact that

such a narrative did not arise at an earlier stage leads to the conclusion

that it may be an afterthought introduced by the appellant.

26. PW 01 and the appellant have been neighbours for some time and have

been well acquainted with one another. This familiarity has contributed

to a misunderstanding when the appellant pointed a firearm at PW 01.

PW 01 has initially believed that the appellant was joking. However, as

the situations escalated, PW 01 has quickly realized that the appellant

was not joking, leading to a sudden surge of fear for his life and well-

being.

Page 17 of 23

27. In an instinctive reaction to this insinuation, PW 01s wife has taken

action. She has thrown the loaded ammunition magazines toward the

appellant, an act of desperation to protect her husband and assert their

safety. The appellant has taken possession of the magazines before

leaving the scene.

28. The scenario involves the appellant with an intention to gain

wrongfully has moved two loaded ammunition magazines, movable

property, out of the possession of PW 01 without his consent

consequent to causing fear of instant death/ hurt in PW 01.

29. A protracted duration before the evidence was presented can raise

significant concerns. Nine years or more is an extensive period, during

which memories may fade, details can be lost and the context of events

may be forgotten. This delay can lead to questions about the accuracy

of the testimonies. Witnesses may struggle to recall specifics after a

significant time gap. Memories can change, leading to inaccuracies in

testimony. Stress, trauma and natural passage of time can all affect

how events are remembered. One of the witnesses has been only eight

Page 18 of 23

years old at the time of the incident. Children often have different

capabilities for memory and factual recall compared to adults. Their

understanding of events may be limited, and they could misinterpret or

misunderstand what they witnessed. This could lead to testimonies that

lack detail or clarity. New evidence or accounts from others that

contradict the earlier comprehension of facts can also create confusion,

or that therein recollections could have been influenced by later

discussions or pressures.

30. Further, the discrepancies discussed earlier do not have a direct

bearing on the prosecutions case. The contradictions and omissions

identified do not pertain to the key elements that are necessary for

establishing the prosecutions case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Consequently, these discrepancies should be deemed irrelevant and

disregarded in the context of the case.

31. It is essential to focus on the fundamental aspects that constitute the

prosecutions case. In legal proceedings, the burden of proof lies with

the prosecution, and they must establish each essential element of the

crime charged with clarity and certainty. Therefore, any discrepancies

Page 19 of 23

that not directly impact the core issues at hand should not undermine

the integrity of the prosecutions case.

32. The principle set out in section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance No.14

of 1895 emphasizes that the number of witnesses required to

substantiate a claim or fact is not fixed or premeditated. The principle

allows for flexibility in the presentation of evidence. It acknowledges

that a single witnesss testimony can be sufficient to establish the truth

of a fact, depending on the credibility of that witness. The focus shifts

from the quantity of evidence to its quality. A credible witness can

provide more compelling evidence than multiple witnesses who may

lack reliability.

33. Further, in contemporary society, there is a growing trend in which

individuals exhibit reluctance to engage in litigation, whether as

contesting parties or as witnesses. This reluctance has profound

implications, particularly when it comes to assisting investigators in

crime. This could significantly hamper the effectiveness of law

enforcement efforts. Additionally, this aversion extends to the

reluctance of individuals to provide witness accounts regarding

Page 20 of 23

criminal acts. Several factors contribute to this pervasive reluctance.

Fear of retaliation, the legal system being intimidating and lengthy,

causing potential witnesses to feel overwhelmed or reluctant to

participate, are reasons for such reluctance.

34. Consequently, the prosecutions examination of witnesses during the

trial who were essential to its case.

35. In the realm of criminal justice, the testimony of witnesses is vital for

the integrity of legal proceedings. However, it is not uncommon for

witnesses to withhold specific details such as the date of the offence

until it is suggested to them by the Counsel. Several factors can justify

this reluctance to provide information.

36. Human memory is inherently unreliable specially when it pertains to

specific details like dates. Witnesses may struggle to recall exact dates

due to the overwhelming stress of witnessing a crime. When a Counsel

suggests a date, it can serve as a cognitive cue, triggering recollections

that the witness might have otherwise overlooked. Therefore, this

Page 21 of 23

hesitation is not necessarily an indication of deceit but a reflection of

complexities of human memory. Further emotional distress can impair

the ability of a witness to recall details clearly. When a Counsel suggests

a date, it may provide the witness with a sense of security, allowing a

witness to be more confident in his response. Thus, the initial

reluctance can be understood as a natural response to high-stress

circumstances. Also, a witness may feel overwhelmed by the formality

and pressure of proceedings in a Court house. As a result, a witness

might wait for prompts to provide information that the witness believed

is expected or necessary. This behaviour aligns with the common

psychological tendency in high pressure situations to rely on external

cues for guidance.

37. Recognizing these distinctions allows for a fairer interpretation of the

reliability and intentions of witnesses in judicial proceedings.

38. The Counsel for the appellant has contended that the appellants

initial discharge of his firearm into the air inadvertently drew the

attention of nearby police officers, who were engaged in road clearance

duty at the time. This act which was likely intended as a warning,

Page 22 of 23

resulted in a tragic unforeseen series of events. Due to a

misunderstanding involving mistaken identity, the police officers,

believing themselves to be responding to a threat, have discharged their

weapons in the direction of the appellant and the deceased. The

appellant has subsequently witnessed the horrifying moment when the

deceased was struck by police gunfire. While the appellant has

presented this narrative as a critical part of his defence, it is important

to note that key elements of this account have not been brought up

during the cross examination of prosecution witnesses. The omissions

of the appellants perspective during this critical phase of the trial raises

significant concerns about the credibility of his claims. Furthermore,

the failure to address this omission leaves unanswered questions

regarding the reliability of the appellants account, which appears to be

an afterthought rather than a well-integrated part of the defence of the

appellant.

39. In light of these considerations, it becomes evident that relying solely

on the appellants narrative may not be advisable. The unexplained

gaps in the appellants testimony, calls into question the accuracy of

this story. Consequently, it is imperative that the Court approach this

narrative with caution, weighing the available evidence carefully before

drawing any conclusions about the appellants involvement in this

incident.

40. Due to the circumstances set out above, I am not inclined to interfere

with the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order.

Accordingly, I dismiss the instant appeal.

I make no order regarding costs.

41. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Anuradhapura for compliance.
