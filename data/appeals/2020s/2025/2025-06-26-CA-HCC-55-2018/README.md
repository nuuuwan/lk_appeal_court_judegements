Page 3 of 10

ii. During the course of the same transaction, you did possess

03.19 grams of Diacetyl Morphine, an offence punishable in

terms of section 54A(d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (as amended by Act No. 13 of

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant in respect of both charges and sentenced

the appellant as follows;

Charge 01

Life imprisonment.

Charge 02

Life imprisonment.

4. The appellant being aggrieved by the disputed judgment together

with the sentencing order has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. On November 02, 2013, PW01 Inspector of Police, Chandana along

with the officers mentioned in his testimony have left the Colombo

Crimes Division to conduct routine surveillance activities. PW01

has been dressed in his uniform while the other officers have worn

civilian clothing.

Page 4 of 10

6. The team has travelled by van to Nawagampura and then

proceeded on foot beyond the Nawagampura Kovil to carry out

their surveillance. The objective of the team of officers have been

to apprehend individuals involved in illegal drug trafficking

activities.

7. While the team of officers were proceeding on foot, PW01 has

spotted an individual dressed in a white shirt and black trousers

turning towards the gate of the Nawagampura ground. Upon

noticing the officers and since the gate was locked the individual

has turned back and headed in the direction from which he came.

8. This behaviour has raised suspicion in PW01. Following PW01s

instructions, the officers have pursued the individual. Upon

apprehending the suspicious person PS 10757 Fonseka has

detained him while PW01 began to search the individual.

9. During the search, PW01 has discovered a pink cellophane bag

tied in a knot from the possession of the particular individual.

PW01 has untied the bag and identified its contents as a powdered

substance mixed with heroin.

10. PW01 has re-knotted the pink cellophane bag and placed it in an

envelope which he has kept in his possession. Subsequently, PW01

has arrested the individual identified as the appellant. On the way

Page 5 of 10

back to the Colombo Crimes Division, the officers have stopped at a

pawn shop to weigh the contents of the pink cellophane bag. After

weighing the cellophane bag has been wrapped in a white paper

and placed in an envelope which has then been sealed and kept in

the possession of PW01.

11. Upon returning to the Colombo Crimes Division, the officers have

followed the relevant procedures. The sealed envelope registered as

a production in the Sri Lanka Police Property receipt book and

allocated the number PR 174/13. After completing those

procedures, PW01 has handed over both the appellant and the

production to the officer in charge of the reserve of such division at

that time.

12. The production has been retained at the reserve without any

tampering and has been subsequently forwarded to the Government

Analyst for analysis. The Government Analysts has conducted a

series of tests and prepared a comprehensive report which has been

submitted as evidence and marked as an exhibit -8. According

to the findings of the report, the analysis has revealed the powdered

substance had contained 03.19 grams of heroin.

Case of the appellant

13. The appellant asserts that the law enforcement officers questioned

him regarding the residence of one Nona Amma. After the appellant

identified the house, the officers searched the premises and

Page 6 of 10

recovered several suspicious items. Following this discovery, the

officers have questioned the appellant about Nona Ammas

whereabouts. When the appellant was unable to provide the

requested information, the officers have presented a recovered item

and falsely implicated the appellant in the matter.

14. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel

for the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law by convicting

the appellant for trafficking without having additional

evidence?

ii. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law by failing to

consider the improbability of the prosecutions case?

15. The Learned Counsel has also contended that the Learned High

Court Judge has erred in law by convicting the appellant of

trafficking a narcotic substance without sufficient additional

evidence to substantiate such a charge. This argument raises a

critical question about the standard of evidence required in

trafficking cases.

16. Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance (as amended) provides as follows,

traffic means-

(a) to sell, give, procure, store, administer, transport,

send, deliver or distribute; or

Page 7 of 10

(b) to offer to do anything specified in paragraph (a).

17. In Mohamed Iqbal Mohamed Sadat vs. The Attorney General,

SC/SPL/ LA/58/15, SC Appeal 110/15 decided on December 14,

2020, Aluwihare, P.C., J, has stated as follows;

As far as the mental element is concerned, I am of the

view that the offence or [drug] trafficking is similar to

possession, since it requires to be established that the

perpetrator knowingly possessed or had control over a

dangerous drug. Thus, one cannot engage in drug

trafficking while being unaware that he or she is in

possession of a drug, or if he or she reasonably but

mistakenly believes that the substance is legal. The

offence of drug trafficking, however, also requires that the

prosecution establish that the perpetrator was involved in

the selling, procuring, storing, administering,

transporting, delivering or distributing of such drugs, or

had offered to do anything referred to above [Definition of

the term traffic in section 54 A of the Ordinance]. It is

this additional requirement [of an act] that transforms the

status of the offence [of possession] to trafficking.

Since possession and trafficking can look the same at

first glance, prosecution for drug trafficking typically

requires producing additional circumstantial evidence to

indicate that the accused was in possession of drugs not

for personal use but for commercial purposes. The

quantity of the drug detected would be a good indicator

Page 8 of 10

to decide whether the perpetrator is a user [an addict] or

is trading in drugs. This would be a question of fact.

18. The evidence presented indicates that the gross quantity of the

powdered substance mixed with heroin seized was 19.69 grams.

This quantity is significantly larger than what would typically be

possessed by an individual for personal consumption, suggesting

that the appellant may not have been carrying the substance for

personal use. The possession of such a substantial quantity of a

narcotic substance can lead to reasonable inferences about the

individuals intent and activity concerning the substance. It is

widely recognised that an addict would ordinarily possess only a

minimal quantity for personal consumption. Particularly because

of the high cost of narcotics. Therefore, the sheer amount in

question supports an inference that the appellant possessed the

narcotic substance for distribution rather than for personal use.

Given these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the Court to

infer that the appellant had this large quantity of powdered

substance mixed with heroin for the purpose of selling.

Consequently, the contention presented by the Learned Counsel for

the appellant which suggests that the conviction of trafficking

lacked a solid evidentiary foundation, appears to lack merit. The

overwhelming evidence of the excessive quantity presents a

compelling case supporting the trafficking charge.

19. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has also drawn the

attention of this Court to specific portions of evidence found in

pages 44, 45, 46, 65, 66 and 67 of the brief. Specifically, as regards

Page 9 of 10

to the distance at which the appellant was first spotted and

thereafter apprehended. The Learned Counsel contends that it is

evident the appellant has identified the team of officers from a

distance. Had he in fact been in possession of a narcotic substance

it is argued he would have altered his course and blended in among

the crowd to evade contact with the officers.

20. However, the Learned Counsels argument attempts to generalise

the behaviour of an individual in a specific situation. This approach

is fundamentally flawed. Human behaviour is inherently complex

and can vary significantly from person to person, influenced by a

multitude of factors. Each individuals response to a similar

situation is likely to be affected by their unique circumstances,

personal experiences and psychological state at the particular

moment.

21. To draw sweeping conclusions about how one person may or may

not react to the presence of law enforcement officers overlooks

these crucial nuances. Therefore, it is essential to recognise that

while the appellants behaviour may seem indicative of innocence

or guilt, it cannot be applied to all individuals in comparable

situations.

22. Further, this Court must also remain mindful of the variety of

motivations and reactions that can arise when a person finds

Page 10 of 10

himself confronted with the authority, particularly in the context of

potentially having illegal substances in his possession.

23. Due to the matters discussed above, I am not inclined to interfere

with the disputed judgment together with the sentencing order and

proceed to dismiss the appeal.

I make no order regarding costs.

24. The terms of life imprisonment shall commence from the date of

conviction.

25. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to

the High Court of Colombo for compliance.
