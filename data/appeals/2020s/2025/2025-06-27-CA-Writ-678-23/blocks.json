Thus, there is an imbalance. Further, it is argued that since the buses are carrying passengers, the said buses should be regularly maintained and there should be regular mechanical inspections. It was also submitted that the drivers for the buses should be given adequate rest. It was also contended by the Respondents that they expect the Petitioners to do regular maintenance on the buses and provide a rest day for the crew. Therefore, considering the above submissions it is observed that by the issuance of an additional permit the buses will have more free time to be sent for regular inspection and maintenance thereby creating a fleet of buses that are in an acceptable and good condition.",

Considering the above argument the Petitioners main concern seems to be their unproven projections of losing revenue. In my view, the entire submission of the Petitioners was based on the concerns of the said bus operators possible loss of earnings. This is evident by the pleadings of the Petitioners especially in paragraphs 29 and 32 of the Petition.
