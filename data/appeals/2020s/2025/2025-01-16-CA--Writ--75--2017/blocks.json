However, with the introduction of the amendment in 1985, the legislature had intended to deviate from such position and to take into account matters such as the turnover of business of such trade, the profit that is likely to be earned in such trade and the essential nature of the goods or services supplied in the course of such trade in addition to the annual value, where such licence authorizes the use of such premises for the purposes of any trade.",
