JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Kalutara

on the following charge namely, committing the offence of rape on

Jayasundarage Subhashini on or before the 09th July 2011, within the

jurisdiction of the court which is an offence punishable under Section 364(1)

of the Penal Code.

On 27.08.2014, the Appellant was present in Court and requested a Counsel

assigned by the Court. Accordingly, a Counsel was assigned and served the

indictment on the Appellant. Thereafter, the Appellant had absconded the

Court. As such evidence under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 (Hereinafter referred to as CPC) was led and

the case fixed for trial in absentia of the Appellant.

Before leading evidence led under Section 241 of the CPC, on 28.11.2016 the

Counsel assigned for the Appellant withdrew from the case. As such the

Appellant was not represented by a Counsel at the Trial Court.

As the Appellant absconded the Court, the trial proceeded in absentia and

after a trial by the judge, the Appellant was convicted as charged, and was

sentenced to 12 years rigours imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/-. In

default 06 months simple imprisonment was imposed. Further, a sum of

Rs.200,000/- compensation was ordered with a default term of 24 months

simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. Also, at the time of

argument the Appellant was connected via zoom platform from prison.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds of appeal:

1. There is a fatal procedural irregularity that denied the Appellant a fair

trial.

2. The charge has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

In this case the prosecutrix was 17 years old at the time of the incident.

In the first ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the Appellant

highlighted certain irregularities that dined the Appellant a fair trial.

A fair trial ensures that accused of crimes receive a just and impartial legal

process. This right includes various elements such as the right to counsel,

the right to confront witnesses, and the right to a public hearing.

The Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right of a person

charged with an offence to be heard by person or by an Attorney-at-law at a

fair trial by a competent Court.

The Attorney General v. Segulebbe Latheef and Others [2008] 1 SLR 225

J.A.N. de Silva. J. held:

"The right of an accused person to a fair trial is recognized in all the

criminal justice systems in the civilized world. Its denial is generally

proof enough that justice is denied."

(2) Like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is also not capable of a clear

definition.

CA/HCC/ 267/23

4 | P a g e

The right to a fair trial amongst other things includes the following: -

1. The equality of all persons before the court.

2. A fair and public hearing by a competent independent and impartial

court/tribunal established by law.

3. Presumption of innocence until guilt is proven according to law.

4. The right of an accused person to be informed or promptly and in

detail in a language he understands of the nature and cause of the

charge against him.

5. The right of an accused to have time and facilities for preparation for

the trial.

6. The right to have a counsel and to communicate with him.

7. The right of an accused to be tried without much delay.

8. The right of an accused to be tried in his presence and to defend

himself or through counsel.

9. The accused has a right to be informed of his rights.

10. If the accused is in indigent circumstances to provide legal

assistance without any charge from the accused.

11. The right of an accused to examine or have examined the

witnesses against him and to obtain the evidence and examination of

witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses

against him.

12. If the accused cannot understand or speak the language in which

proceedings are conducted to have the assistance of an interpreter.

13. The right of an accused not to be compelled to testify against

himself or to confess guilty.

In this case the Appellant was tried in absentia until the conclusion of the

prosecution case. The indictment was not read out to him as he absconded

the very next date after service of the indictment. But he was arrested and

produced before the case was fixed for Judgment. When he was produced

before the High Court on 14.09.2023, neither a Counsel appeared nor a

CA/HCC/ 267/23

5 | P a g e

Counsel was assigned by the Court. Although, the learned High Court Judge,

in his judgment at page 119 of the brief stated that when inquired as to why

the Appellant evaded the Court, he did not say anything.

Upon perusal of the brief, there is no proceedings available to say that the

learned High Court Judge had asked explanation from the Appellant for his

absence nor assigned a Counsel to defend his case. Further, no record

whatsoever available to establish that he was afforded an opportunity under

Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 to prove

his absence was bona fide.

Although, the learned High Court Judge stated that the trial was commenced

after the indictment was read over and the Appellant pleaded guilty, there is

no record to say that the Appellant was produced, indictment was served

and was read over to him.

The Appellant was produced before the High Court on 14.09.2023.

Previously, on 08.09.2023 the case was fixed for written submission. But the

judgment was delivered on 19.09.2023.

In Jayasooriya and Others v Attorney General [2009] 1 SLR 101 held:

"Every trial judge has, an obligation and responsibility to maintain a proper

and accurate record of what transpires before him in every trial. ... the

appellate Court should always be guided by what transpires in the case

record and not on some extrinsic material of which the trial judge had no

control whatsoever."

Proper and accurate record ensures integrity of the fair trial. Absence of

proceedings renders a denial of a fair trial.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring a procedurally

CA/HCC/ 267/23

6 | P a g e

equal position during the course of a trial. It would be difficult to identify in

advance all of the situations that could constitute violations of the fair trial

principle.

Jayant Patel, J. in the case of Jusabbhai Ayubbhai v. State of Gujarat

CR.MA/623/2012 stated that:

..It is by now recognized principles that justice to one party should

not result into injustice to the other side and it will be for the Court to

balance the right of both the sides and to uphold the law.

In the 2nd ground of appeal advanced, the Appellant contended that the

prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that sexual

intercourse took place without the consent of the prosecutrix.

The prosecutrix giving evidence admitted that she was 17 years old at the

time of the incident and only her father was in the house. The Appellant said

to have entered the house at 11.00pm and told her that he wants to marry

her. Although she had refused the proposal, but failed to raise cries or inform

her father at that time. During the said period, the Appellant was residing in

her house as he had separated from his wife.

The victim remained silent when she was questioned about the incident. But

the learned State Counsel had posted several leading questions to get the

incident from the victim.

The victim admitted that the Appellant did not threaten her but proposed to

marry her. But the learned High Court Judge in his judgment concludes that

the victim was threatened by the Appellant.

Although her father was at home at the time of the incident, she had only

informed her mother who returned from abroad after three months of the

incident. The complaint was lodged after the arrival of her mother. But the

prosecution had not called her mother who was listed as PW2 in the

indictment.

CA/HCC/ 267/23

7 | P a g e

Further, in her history to the doctor she had said when she was sleeping

with her grandmother the Appellant had committed the offence. Her

grandmother was neither listed as a witness in the indictment nor called as

a prosecution witness.

According to the investigating officer, investigation revealed that the victims

father had committed a sexual act on the daughter of the Appellant.

Under these circumstances, calling evidence of PW2 and the grandmother of

the victim is very essential in this case.

Professor G. L. Peiris in his book Offences under the Penal Code of Sri

Lanka at page 222 states:

It is a fundamental principle that, where the womans consent is an

issue, a conviction of rape will be upheld only in circumstances where

the prosecution has succeeded in establishing absence of consent

beyond a reasonable doubt. If proof of this element is lacking, the cause

of the prosecution is necessarily incomplete. Consequently, no burden

devolves on the defence in these circumstances. Any departure from

this position culminates in a miscarriage of justice.

In the case of Premasiri v. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri.L.R. 106, Justice

E. Basnayake observed that,

The learned counsel complained that the accused was convicted on

uncorroborated evidence. There is no rule that there must in every case,

be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. (Gour on

Penal Law of India 11th Edition page 2567 quoting Raghobgr Singhe vs.

State (2); Rameshwar, Kalyan Singh vs. State of Rajasthan (3). It is well

settled law that a conviction for the offence of rape can be based on the

sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there

is no infirmity. (Bhola Ram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (4)). If the

evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particular. The

CA/HCC/ 267/23

8 | P a g e

testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of

the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and

be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestation. State

of Punjab vs. Gurmit Singhe (5).

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of the corroboration as a

matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to

dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath

Biswas vs. State (6)). In Sunil and another vs. the Attorney General

Dheeraratne J with H. A. G. De Silva and Ramanathan JJ agreeing held

that if the evidence of the complainant is so convincing, they

could act on that evidence alone, even in the absence of her

evidence being corroborated. (Emphasis added).

In the case of State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murthy AIR

1997 SC 1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

When an accused is facing a serious criminal charge it is essential that every

point in favour of the accused, though it may seem trivial, should be placed

before the judge. It may well be that all such matters, if so, placed before the

judge may create a reasonable doubt, the benefit of which should accrue to

the accused.

In this case the learned High Court judge had not considered the evidence

favourable to the Appellant. He only considered the evidence given by the

prosecutrix and arrived at the conclusion that the evidence given by the

prosecutrix is convincing and reliable and therefore, the prosecution had

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/ 267/23

9 | P a g e

After careful perusal of the evidence presented in the trial, I am of the view

that the evidence presented by the prosecution is tainted with serious

shortcoming and ambiguity. Therefore, it is not safe to act on such evidence

of the prosecution against the appellant.

Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution and the very serious

procedural irregularities taken place in this case, I concluded that the

grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant carry sufficient merit to

substantiate awarding the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant.

I, therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

Appellant by the learned High court Judge of Kalutara. The Appellant is

acquitted from the charge.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to High Court of Kalutara

along with the original case record.
