3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant of the charges in the indictment, sentenced the appellant as follows;

Charge 01 A term of 7 years rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs.100,000.00 with a term of one-year simple imprisonment, in default. Charge 02 A term of 7 years rigorous imprisonment and also imposed a fine of Rs.100,000.00 with a term of one year simple imprisonment, in default.

4. Aggrieved by the conviction, the disputed judgment and the sentencing

order, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

5. When the matter was taken up for argument, the learned counsel for

the appellant informed Court that the appellant did not wish to contest the conviction but only the sentencing order. Accordingly, the following ground of appeal was urged by the Learned Counsel for the appellant;

i. Are the sentences imposed on the appellant disproportionate?

6. The law at the time the indictment was forwarded has mandated a

specific penalty for the offences for which the appellant was convicted.

The penalty was as follows; fine not less than one hundred thousand rupees and not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees and imprisonment of either description for a period not less than seven years and not exceeding twenty years.

The Learned High Court Judge has thoroughly considered this legal framework, along with the pertinent facts presented in mitigation.

7. While the Learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted a request

in the High Court for a non-custodial sentence, he has not sufficiently elaborated on the reasons or the circumstances in support of such plea. 8. Nonetheless, the Learned High Court Judge has taken into account

several significant factors including the appellants age i.e. he is a sixty-five-year-old male and his role as the sole breadwinner for his family, which includes two children. In the light of these considerations, the disputed sentencing order has been made after a comprehensive review of all relevant facts presented to the Learned High Court Judge. 9. This Court remains mindful of the legal obligations imposed by the

mandatory sentencing laws, while also weighing the personal circumstances of the appellant considering a balanced approach to justice. 10. In those circumstances, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the

disputed sentencing order. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

I make no order regarding costs.

11. However, the substantial terms of rigorous imprisonment of 7 years

each, shall commence from the date of conviction, i.e., September 06, 2023, and run concurrently.

12. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to

the High Court of Colombo for compliance.
